[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] Hallelujah for the Lord our God, the almighty reigns let us
[time=41] rejoice and exalt and give him the glory for the marriage of the lamb has come and
[time=47] his bride has made herself ready. It was granted her to clothe herself with
[time=55] fine linen, bright, and pure. For the linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.
[time=63] And the angel said to me, write this, blessed are those who are invited to the
[time=71] marriage supper of the lamb. And he said to me, these are the true words of God,
[time=79] then I fell down at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, you must not do
[time=85] that. I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony
[time=93] of Jesus. Worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. You
[time=102] may be seated. We're going to sing together about our bridegroom church, the
[time=109] one that Steve just read about.
[time=132] He claimed, Hallelujah, what a Savior, bearing shame, scoffing root. In my place
[time=150] is condemned, he stood, sealed my pardon, with his blood. Hallelujah, what a
[time=166] [MUSIC - 282 seconds]
[time=453] - Let's stand as we sing this.
[time=454] [MUSIC - 8 seconds]
[time=470] - Worthy is the lamb.
[time=471] [MUSIC - 275 seconds]
[time=758] (audience applauding) - Father in heaven, we adore you today with our songs, with our thoughts and our words and our prayers.
[time=769] God, you are the king of all.
[time=772] God, your word reminded me this morning that you know the end before the beginning.
[time=779] God, you are omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient.
[time=785] They all powerful God who knows everything and knows the end of Revelation 19 before you even created the world.
[time=794] And we will praise you the king of kings forever and ever because unto you and unto you alone belong all power and glory and wisdom and praise and thanks and blessing.
[time=807] And God, we wanna join in with the throngs this morning that adore you and praise you and sing out that you are the one true God.
[time=817] The one true God who loved the world so much that you sent your son into the world.
[time=822] The one true God that raised up your son in righteousness so that he could be the atoning sacrifice on the cross that would redeem a broken and fallen people and bring them near to you, a holy and perfect God.
[time=835] And a God who raised up his son to be highly exalted and give him the name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee would bow and tongue would confess that he's Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[time=850] And God, thanks for teaching us those truths in your word and allowing us to gather like we do today to sing your praise and to listen to the truth of your word proclaimed in this place.
[time=862] May it bring you great honor and great praise today we ask in Jesus name, amen.
[time=868] We had a pastor once that used to say that every time we gather and assemble, it's dress rehearsal for the new Jerusalem.
[time=878] And Corbin, thank you for helping us to prepare ourselves
[time=884] like that bride for her husband.
[time=886] Good morning, everybody.
[time=888] Do not adjust your television sets.
[time=891] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=893] I've had the great privilege of teaching at Blackhawk Christian School for seven years.
[time=900] This is the right seventh year there.
[time=901] And the elders of this church have allowed me to share the pulpit once in a while with you.
[time=909] It's my great honor and joy to do that as well.
[time=911] I love this place.
[time=912] I love you and this chance to share with you now in the 11th hour of 2010 is something I'm looking forward to for a really long time.
[time=922] If you have your Bibles, open them please to Revelation chapter 19, Steve, long break.
[time=928] Read with us that passage that will be in this morning
[time=934] earlier today.
[time=935] I just have to say that in light of what I just said to Corbin, I hope that you like singing because all over the book of Revelation, there's music.
[time=945] There's music everywhere.
[time=947] In Revelation chapter four, I don't know if you saw this or not, but it says the four living creatures sing that song, holy, holy, holy is the Lord God almighty who was and is and it's to come.
[time=957] They never stop singing it.
[time=958] Day and night, they never stop.
[time=963] They're gonna be singing it for all the eternities.
[time=965] Let's hope you like singing.
[time=968] Hope you like music.
[time=969] That's why we gather and we do that.
[time=971] We gather and we sing together because that's what we're gonna be doing in the New Jerusalem.
[time=976] God likes music.
[time=979] He's a good, he's a singer, Zephaniah chapter three says that God rejoices over us with singing.
[time=985] Is that amazing?
[time=988] God is a singer.
[time=989] So thank you.
[time=991] The most appropriate and full expression of Revelation 19 is in Handel's Messiah, which I've mentioned it to you before.
[time=998] I've pitched it to you before.
[time=1000] I'm pitching it at you again.
[time=1001] If you haven't, if you didn't get a Hanukkah Messiah for Christmas, buy it for yourself for Christmas as I can New Year's present, there is nothing that explains these realities better in music than Handel's Messiah.
[time=1015] I was visiting again yesterday, washing over me like waves.
[time=1019] Hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent raineth.
[time=1023] Nothing like that.
[time=1025] It's remarkable.
[time=1026] Corbin said a few weeks ago that we sang the word a manual like 93 times.
[time=1031] We're pretty close to that with Hallelujah's this morning.
[time=1033] I stopped counting after 70, but we were way, way up there.
[time=1037] It's a marvelous word.
[time=1039] In Revelation 19, you can take a look at the page in front of you and you can circle the Hallelujah's.
[time=1044] There's four of them in Revelation 19 in those first 10 verses.
[time=1048] It's the only place in the whole New Testament where that word is used.
[time=1053] And it's used four times in this passage.
[time=1057] There's, Hallelujah is a Hebrew word, which means praise the Lord, praise the Yahweh.
[time=1063] Let's find out why they're praising and why they keep breaking in the song and saying these marvelous, marvelous things.
[time=1070] Let's pray together as we start.
[time=1072] I wanna encourage you, 'cause Christmas is now in the rear view mirror, at least as far as the calendar is concerned, but I wanna encourage you to let this be a springboard for the new year and that these things would captivate you from God's word and launch us out together in the new year with a sense of obedience and purpose and all of it.
[time=1091] We would see things as God sees them.
[time=1094] Let's pray to that end.
[time=1098] Father, we sing with the angels and with the living creatures, your holiness, your absolute moral perfection.
[time=1108] We proclaim the blessing and glory and power and honor.
[time=1112] They belong to you and to you alone.
[time=1115] Guys, this morning, Father, I pray that we together would be given ears to hear and eyes to see what you have said to your servant, John, through your son, Jesus.
[time=1127] We pray in his name, amen.
[time=1129] There's an outline in your bulletin, if you'd like to follow along and fill in some of the blanks as we go.
[time=1138] The new Americans in the verse and says that calls this section the fourfold hallelujah, which seems wildly appropriate, 'cause there's four hallelujah's in this section.
[time=1147] The first Roman numeral there is hallelujah's number one and two.
[time=1151] Let's read again the first couple of verses and talk about them just for a minute.
[time=1156] Verse one begins after this, I heard.
[time=1160] If you flip through the book of Revelation and go back to Revelation chapter one for a moment if you would, please.
[time=1166] I'll have to go back to Revelation chapter one.
[time=1168] The first verse of Revelation describes that John is given a vision from Jesus.
[time=1174] It's the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his people.
[time=1179] And John is in a prison, as you well know, on an island in the Mediterranean Sea, the island of Patanus.
[time=1186] And John is in his cell, probably down in the ground looking up, I'm not really sure, we're not really told.
[time=1193] But John, it's like he sees a parade past his cell.
[time=1197] You can envision it that way.
[time=1198] After this I saw, if you flip through Revelation, every chapter, after the first three chapters, I saw this.
[time=1205] After I saw this, after I saw this, like John's got a parade marching past his cell where God shows him the way that things actually are.
[time=1215] I have a rant, I have a jukebox of rants in my classroom.
[time=1222] I press the button, there's rant A or rant B or rant C.
[time=1227] One of my favorite rants is about this phrase, the real world.
[time=1230] Not a fan of that phrase.
[time=1233] I probably talked to you guys about it with you before, but quickly, if the real world is what I saw in the news this past week, I'm not interested.
[time=1243] I should get a gallon of ice cream and go sit in my bed.
[time=1247] It's bleak.
[time=1250] If that's real, if the real world takes little girls from their bedroom two days before Christmas, if that's real, if the real world is airplanes being hijacked or tried to be hijacked, flying into Detroit, if the real world is any number of endless sufferings and pains and abandonment, I'm not interested in that reality.
[time=1272] What Revelation is doing, Revelation 19 is doing it like a bullseye, is God is showing us the real world.
[time=1282] This is what's real.
[time=1283] 1 Corinthians 13 says that we see things now through a glass darkly.
[time=1289] We see things like far, far away and John is in this chapter, bringing it right up close in high definition.
[time=1298] What is real?
[time=1299] Jesus tells John, John, you know what's real?
[time=1303] Is that one day, all the evil forces in the world, all the enemies of the gospel will be forever, completely and totally destroyed.
[time=1313] That's real.
[time=1316] All the pretended sovereignty of Babylon, the great prostitute Babylon that steals our affections and wants our money and our time and our talent, our treasure, all those things.
[time=1328] Well, one day the smoke from that will go up forever and ever.
[time=1331] That's reality.
[time=1332] Not what you see on the news.
[time=1334] We are strangers, guys.
[time=1337] We're passing through.
[time=1338] We are aliens and sojourners in the world.
[time=1342] We don't belong here.
[time=1343] We are citizens of a different country.
[time=1345] And Revelation 19 brings that to full expression.
[time=1349] And I can't wait to talk about it with you.
[time=1350] It's all out ahead of us.
[time=1353] Revelation chapter 17 comes to four, chapter 18.
[time=1356] And 18 before 19, just trying to be helpful.
[time=1361] Revelation 17 and 18 describe the prophecy of Babylon's destruction.
[time=1367] It will take place.
[time=1369] Revelation 19 says, now it's happening.
[time=1372] So 17, 18 and 19 are all about the destruction, the judgment, the forever annihilation of all those forces in the world that line themselves up against God and his people and his saints.
[time=1383] My friend Jane Walters, a teacher at the school with me, has posters in her classroom of the persecuted church.
[time=1391] The people are still dying for the name of Jesus in the world today.
[time=1394] We forget that sometimes.
[time=1395] People are still persecuted for their faith in Christ.
[time=1400] We haven't been given that honor in the states like we might otherwise have been given it.
[time=1403] But one day it says in Revelation 19, that those that murdered the saints, that dismissed them, that scorned them, that mocked them, the through them in prison, one day they will be destroyed forever.
[time=1416] God will avenge the blood of his children.
[time=1420] God is a good father.
[time=1421] More on that later.
[time=1424] Look at verse one with me.
[time=1426] Again, after this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude.
[time=1433] It's something like the mega voice of a much crowd.
[time=1438] It's with the language.
[time=1439] It's very peculiar because it's no way to explain it.
[time=1443] You guys ever ever been at a football game with lots and lots of people?
[time=1448] Raise your hands, a football game, basketball game, lots and lots of people, like 50,000 people.
[time=1452] When something happens, the crowd rises up, the crowd roars.
[time=1457] I think the NIV says that.
[time=1458] The NIV says the roar of a great multitude.
[time=1460] The crowd rises up at a rock concert or a football game.
[time=1466] Touchdown, your favorite song comes on and the crowd rises up.
[time=1472] This is multitudes of those.
[time=1474] Like a wave cresting, the loud voice,
[time=1480] the mega voice of a much crowd yells out for much more than a touchdown or a great song.
[time=1487] They shout hallelujah to the father, letter A in your outline.
[time=1492] They're starting hallelujah four times in this passage for these reasons, letter A, because salvation, glory and power belong to him.
[time=1502] I am so glad at this church that we're steadfast that worship isn't just singing music.
[time=1509] Worship is what we're about to do right now, okay?
[time=1513] I'm gonna define for you what those words mean as they're used in the New Testament.
[time=1518] Salvation, glory and power.
[time=1521] And I invite you to worship with me as I read to you that these things belong, guys, they belong to him.
[time=1528] They are the core of who God is in his person.
[time=1534] Worship with me as I read these things to you.
[time=1536] Salvation.
[time=1538] Salvation is the sum of benefits and blessings which redeemed persons will enjoy.
[time=1545] Freed from all earthly ills, they will enjoy those after the visible return of Christ from heaven in the consummated and eternal kingdom of God.
[time=1556] Salvation.
[time=1557] How great a salvation.
[time=1561] The author of Hebrews says, "How shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation?" Did you hear that definition just a moment ago?
[time=1572] I think sometimes we sell the salvation that we enjoy from God's short, especially in a place where we talk about Christianity very casually.
[time=1582] But this is the salvation that God has offered.
[time=1584] It's not simply, "I'm not going to hell," and that's really great.
[time=1587] Salvation is the sum of all the blessings that we enjoy in the person of Jesus.
[time=1592] Not just that you won't go to some place where you'll be suffering, that is true.
[time=1597] And that's awesome and reason to sing that I'm a ruined sinner and that's not what I'm gonna get.
[time=1604] Ruined sinners to reclaim hallelujah what a savior.
[time=1607] That's worth rejoicing about, but friends, it's so much more.
[time=1612] We're saved from things, but also two things.
[time=1615] Glory.
[time=1618] Glory is a thing belonging to God.
[time=1621] It's His kingly majesty.
[time=1623] Next to it, glory, you can shut that down.
[time=1628] God's kingly majesty.
[time=1630] It's the absolutely perfect inward and personal excellency of Christ.
[time=1643] It belongs to Him, power.
[time=1648] The Greek word for power is dunamis.
[time=1650] From which we get dynamite.
[time=1652] It's a very, you'll forget me.
[time=1654] It's a very explosive word.
[time=1655] It is.
[time=1658] It's a word that means like what it sounds.
[time=1661] What does that, when a word means what it sounds like?
[time=1664] Anamadapiah, thank you, Claire.
[time=1668] Okay, power, salvation, glory and power belong to Him.
[time=1673] Power, the moral power and excellence of soul.
[time=1681] Power and resources are rising from numbers.
[time=1683] Power consisting in or resting upon armies, forces and hosts.
[time=1689] Go with me to Luke chapter two, I can't resist.
[time=1695] It's still the season of Christmas.
[time=1698] I said Merry Christmas to folks this morning, even though we're two days past it.
[time=1701] I think it's okay to still do that.
[time=1703] It's interesting when you say happy holidays,
[time=1709] people often do that in place of Merry Christmas.
[time=1713] You're really saying happy holy days.
[time=1715] So no one's getting fooled.
[time=1716] I just thought you should know.
[time=1718] Verse 13, Luke two.
[time=1721] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, host praising God and saying glory to God in the highest.
[time=1733] And on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased.
[time=1739] God has power made manifest in the hosts of angels that proclaimed the birth of his son.
[time=1749] We proclaim hallelujah to him because salvation, glory and power belongs to him.
[time=1753] We proclaim hallelujah because for his truth in verse two.
[time=1758] We proclaim hallelujah friends, letter C for his justice, letter B for his truth, letter C for his justice.
[time=1769] Revelation 15 speaks of this again.
[time=1773] I, my prayers have absolutely been taken over by this idea.
[time=1778] That all of God's judgments are true and just.
[time=1781] All of God's judgments, I'll allow you to respond.
[time=1788] All of God's judgments are true and just.
[time=1791] When you pray that way, your prayers will change.
[time=1797] God, thank you that all of your judgments are true and just.
[time=1801] When I sat in the room with my fellow teachers his past few weeks and listened to their accounts of their suffering and their families.
[time=1810] Real suffering, disease, all manner of things.
[time=1814] I don't get myself permission to share with you in the big room.
[time=1817] And I proclaimed with those people, perhaps with a little bit
[time=1825] of fear in my voice, but I proclaimed it in my weakness.
[time=1828] I said, God, all your judgments are true and just.
[time=1830] Especially when I don't get it.
[time=1838] In Revelation 15, there are seven angels and there are those who are victorious over the beast.
[time=1843] In Revelation 15, three, they say this.
[time=1845] Great and amazing are your deeds.
[time=1849] Oh Lord, God, the Almighty.
[time=1852] Just and true are your ways, O King of the nations.
[time=1857] So it's a theme in Revelation, guys.
[time=1859] Revelation 16, the heavenly altar itself busts out in the singing.
[time=1863] The altar starts singing.
[time=1866] It's almost like it can't help itself.
[time=1868] It's like there's a rushing river behind a dam, it can't break it, it spills out everywhere.
[time=1876] A real sense of that in Revelation, a sense of energy and of force and movement, beautiful.
[time=1882] 16 verse seven, yes, Lord God, the Almighty.
[time=1887] True and just are your judgments.
[time=1891] There is no circumstance in my life, friends, and I imagine in yours where that will not apply to you in the new year.
[time=1897] 'Cause you're gonna get a phone call and that phone call will knock you on the ground.
[time=1903] You've had those phone calls before I have.
[time=1908] I remember the sound of my wife's voice.
[time=1911] The sound of my mother's voice when you get those bad phone calls and you're around and you witness that.
[time=1919] In the face of that, friends, don't be a prisoner to your circumstances.
[time=1922] In the face of great suffering and abandonment and pain, proclaim that all his judgments are true and just.
[time=1929] God has his hands on the wheel of the universe and he has not let go.
[time=1934] Amen, hope we believe that.
[time=1938] I think we sometimes act like we don't.
[time=1940] His truth and his justice.
[time=1945] All his judgments are true and just for his children.
[time=1950] Romans chapter eight in light of that.
[time=1952] Romans chapter eight, verse 26.
[time=1955] The spirit helps us in our weakness for we don't know what to pray for as we ought.
[time=1964] The spirit himself intercedes with us.
[time=1967] He takes our prayers and translates them to the Father with groanings too deep for words.
[time=1972] He who searches, hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
[time=1980] And we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good.
[time=1991] And we know that for those who love God,
[time=1997] all things work together for good.
[time=1999] For those who are called according to his purpose.
[time=2002] Those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brothers.
[time=2012] Watch from Ephesians.
[time=2015] Those whom he predestined, he called.
[time=2019] Those whom he called, he also justified.
[time=2021] And those whom he justified, he also glorified.
[time=2025] There is an unbroken line friends from my predestination to my glorification, to my seat at the table.
[time=2032] That's how God sees this salvation.
[time=2036] And we slough around like, yeah, I'm not going to hell.
[time=2038] That's great.
[time=2039] This is what God, this is how God sees this salvation.
[time=2044] He has worked out in you.
[time=2046] A ruined sinner like me who has been reclaimed.
[time=2049] Oh, that's what God describes my salvation as.
[time=2055] An unbroken line from predestination to glorification.
[time=2066] Roman numeral two, there's more hallelujah is coming because the reign of Babylon has come to an end.
[time=2073] Look at verse two.
[time=2076] His judgments are true and just.
[time=2077] He has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality and has avenged on her the blood of his servants.
[time=2085] That's real.
[time=2089] Once more they cried out, hallelujah.
[time=2094] The smoke from her goes up forever and ever.
[time=2099] It's a powerful message, friends.
[time=2102] Roman numeral two is the next set of hallelujah's.
[time=2106] Hallelujah number three.
[time=2107] Look at verses four and five with me together, moving through the passage.
[time=2112] The 24 elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who was sealed on the throne, saying amen, hallelujah.
[time=2122] The four living creatures and 24 elders represent two separate things.
[time=2127] This is a long conversation that I'll make as brief as I can.
[time=2131] 24 elders represent, probably, all the redeemed people of God throughout all time.
[time=2136] 12 tribes of Israel, 12 apostles, Old Testament, New Testament saints together, all the redeemed persons of God throughout all history.
[time=2144] The four living creatures are from Revelation chapter four and they represent all of creation.
[time=2149] All of God's created order.
[time=2152] So, all the redeemed, all the creation, all breaks out in singing, hallelujah.
[time=2160] They can't help themselves.
[time=2161] They rejoice over what God has done.
[time=2165] Praise our God, all you His servants, you who fear Him, small and great.
[time=2172] All the redeemed, all the creation, resound with a song, amen, hallelujah, of praise to God for His victory.
[time=2181] Let her be in your outlines is the word amen, simply.
[time=2184] Okay, it's gonna be a little interactive.
[time=2188] You can handle it though, okay?
[time=2190] So, you guys are a good crowd.
[time=2193] Here we go.
[time=2194] The word amen is a remarkable word.
[time=2197] It's a remarkable word.
[time=2198] It's come down to us from Hebrew, into Greek, into Latin, into English, unbroken.
[time=2203] Probably the most spoken word in language.
[time=2206] Across cultures, everywhere.
[time=2209] Christian cultures is this word, amen.
[time=2212] It's related very nearly to the Hebrew word for believe.
[time=2215] And so, the word amen means something like, and you've all said the word amen many, many times.
[time=2222] Some of you have said it this morning a few times.
[time=2225] I'm delighted.
[time=2226] Something like, yes, truly.
[time=2232] In fact, in the Greek, when Jesus says, truly, truly, I say to you, the Greek word there is amen.
[time=2239] Amen, amen, I say to you, it will be, it will be.
[time=2242] So, the word amen is something like an expression
[time=2248] of confident certainty.
[time=2250] It's an expression of strong agreement when you hear something with which you strongly agree or you're confidently certain in, don't withhold your amen.
[time=2263] Do not withhold it, okay?
[time=2265] Let's practice, okay?
[time=2269] This is a great, this is a great gift.
[time=2271] A great gift to give Kelly in the new year, okay?
[time=2274] Just, okay, it's the gift that keeps on giving.
[time=2277] Nice, here we go.
[time=2282] Let your amen rise to the one to whom and to whom alone belong salvation, glory and power.
[time=2290] Let it rise to the one whose judgments, all of whose judgments are true and just.
[time=2298] Let it rise to the one who will avenge the blood of his suffering bondservants for millennia of dismissal, scorn, rejection and murder.
[time=2308] Let it rise to the one who uses and has used and is still using at every turn the seemingly weak, improbable, barren, poor and insignificant to accomplish his purposes.
[time=2324] It is good, it is good to bear witness of God's goodness, of his love, of his faithfulness, of the greatness of his salvation.
[time=2334] Yes, literacy, stand in awe of him is a word I took out of the phrase in verse five, but you who fear him, the sense of fear, people like to soften that a little bit and say, well, it means respect, it does mean respect, but they're people that I respect that I also fear.
[time=2355] One time, one time I raise my voice to my mother and my dad picked me up off the ground against the wall and said, son, you will not do that again.
[time=2369] And I didn't.
[time=2370] [AMEN] Rolling now.
[time=2376] See, I respect my father, but I feared him too, 'cause my feet weren't on the ground anymore.
[time=2384] So Psalm 22, 23 says, you who fear the Lord, praise him, all you offspring of Jacob glorify him.
[time=2393] Stand in awe of him filled with wonder, aw, struck wonder at the mention of your name.
[time=2401] All you offspring of Israel.
[time=2406] Okay, Psalm 113, would you all stand with me?
[time=2409] Psalm 113, we're gonna do a little responsive reading.
[time=2412] Don't be afraid.
[time=2415] It's gonna be fine.
[time=2416] Psalm 113, I will read the odd verses, you read the even verses, they'll be on the screen.
[time=2423] You can do it.
[time=2425] The word, there is one word in Hebrew for praise the Lord, it's the word hallelujah.
[time=2432] So I'm gonna substitute praise the Lord with hallelujah because that's what it says in Hebrew.
[time=2437] So I'll read the odds, you read the evens, it'll be in the screens, here we go.
[time=2441] Praise the Lord, hallelujah, praise us servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord.
[time=2447] (audience chattering) From the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the Lord is to be praised.
[time=2459] (audience chattering) Who is like the Lord our God, who is seated on high?
[time=2470] (audience chattering) He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap.
[time=2478] (audience chattering) He gives the barren woman a home, making her the joyous mother of children and altogether,
[time=2492] praise the Lord, hallelujah, you may be seated.
[time=2498] There's no doubt that passage is at work in Revelation 19.
[time=2503] I'll take you lastly, friends, let her see in the outline, stand it off him.
[time=2510] Rowan in row three comes very much to the point.
[time=2513] I was talking with some friends recently.
[time=2515] It's been a year of weddings for Jodi and I, the elders at this church have given me the privilege of doing a few weddings this year.
[time=2521] Some students of mine are getting married, they're getting married soon or they've been married this year.
[time=2527] I'm getting to that age where it's happening, it's fun to watch.
[time=2532] I was talking with some friends recently who said that they want their wedding to be a demonstration, to be a working model of the marriage supper of the lamb.
[time=2542] I just thought to myself, that is fantastic.
[time=2547] I have to talk about that.
[time=2549] So here I am, talking about it with you.
[time=2552] You know, it says marriage supper in the text, but I think marriage feast is better, 'cause everybody has supper, but we don't usually have a feast.
[time=2562] So can I say feast?
[time=2563] Is that okay?
[time=2564] I'm going to anyway.
[time=2565] So the marriage feast of the lamb, every year my wife and I have a dinner with her two sisters and their husbands and her mom and dad, the eight of us around the table.
[time=2577] And we did it this past week and it was great.
[time=2580] And we, big tab, it was fun.
[time=2583] Around the table, the eight of us talking about the year and enjoying each other.
[time=2588] And I just felt joy, you know, very pure pleasure, very real and good and right pleasure.
[time=2596] That's a great gift from God.
[time=2597] And I felt it with those three couples and my wife and I around the table that we loved, just being together, just enjoying each other.
[time=2604] And then I think about this passage and that one day you and I friends, the redeemed ones will be at a table, a really long table.
[time=2615] With all of the redeemed of all eternity with Christ at the head of the table and the joy I felt around that table this past week will not compare.
[time=2626] And it was great joy I felt, but it will not, it will be a candle to the sun.
[time=2632] Do you live with that sense of expectancy?
[time=2636] Do you live in that spirit, that season of waiting, of hopefulness?
[time=2645] The marriage, feast of the land.
[time=2647] Look at verse six with me, Revelation 19.
[time=2649] Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the roar of many waters, like the sound of mighty peels of thunder crying out.
[time=2660] You can hear this like cascading sound.
[time=2663] "Hallelujah, for the Lord, God omnipotent, raineth,"
[time=2669] said Handel, "let us rejoice and exalt and give him the glory for the marriage of the land has come." I thought about Corbin and Tanya and their little girl
[time=2684] and they gotta wait six more weeks.
[time=2688] And when they hold her in their arms, it's gonna be a happy day.
[time=2693] The crowd is singing friends because that time
[time=2699] of waiting thousands and thousands of years is done.
[time=2704] My kids have a hard time waiting for Christmas and so do I.
[time=2706] I have my ever good giving gifts.
[time=2709] Like by December 19th, they're all giving away.
[time=2711] I can't wait till Christmas to give them to our kids.
[time=2713] That's my wife, crazy.
[time=2715] It's hard to wait.
[time=2719] But when the waiting is over, it's what they say.
[time=2723] The marriage of the land has come.
[time=2726] His bride has made herself ready.
[time=2729] It was granted her, very important phrase.
[time=2733] It was granted her to clothe herself with fine linen, bright and pure.
[time=2738] Isaiah 54 and 61 have pictures of God as a husband
[time=2744] and his people as a bridegum.
[time=2746] Everybody into this year, I mentioned that.
[time=2748] That God calls himself a husband.
[time=2753] He uses metaphors to describe himself.
[time=2755] Letter A under Romans 3 is Hallelujah number four.
[time=2759] It's the last Hallelujah.
[time=2762] The Hallelujah there is occasioned by.
[time=2764] All obstacles have been removed.
[time=2767] All the things that we were waiting for have now arrived and the crowd breaks out in one more, Hallelujah.
[time=2774] It is fantastic.
[time=2776] [AMEN] Revelation 19 and verse.
[time=2782] Six, Hallelujah for the Lord God, the Almighty reigns.
[time=2790] The sword, the Almighty in the Greek is a great word.
[time=2792] It's like a Transformers character or something.
[time=2795] It's Panto-Kratohr.
[time=2797] Is that a fun word to say?
[time=2800] It sounds like something marching around, you know?
[time=2802] It's the Greek word for Almighty.
[time=2805] It means that God holds sway over all things.
[time=2809] And it's used 10 times in the New Testament.
[time=2812] It's used nine times in the book of Revelation.
[time=2815] The people who are suffering at the hands of a wicked world system that hates them, hates their gospel.
[time=2821] And John says through Jesus by the Holy Spirit,
[time=2827] God is the Almighty.
[time=2829] God is the one who holds sway over all things.
[time=2832] Not the Romans.
[time=2833] In Isaiah, the suffering exiles were told, I will redeem you like a wife who is cast off and take you to myself.
[time=2845] Let her be, readiness and righteous deeds.
[time=2849] Readiness and righteous deeds.
[time=2852] Friends, I wanna share with you something here about this.
[time=2856] It was granted her to clothe herself.
[time=2861] The ability to put on those garments as a gift from God, you can't do it yourself.
[time=2867] Ephesians two describes that faith itself even is a gift.
[time=2875] And Revelation 19 expresses that again, it was granted her to clothe herself with linens, bright and pure, shining radiant garments.
[time=2885] God deserves that, that great salvation deserves that kind of a gift in return.
[time=2892] Write this down on your notes if you would please.
[time=2895] Obedience is its own blessing.
[time=2903] One day those who are in Christ will enjoy forever blessings at his right hand.
[time=2908] But now, in the meantime, obedience to God is its own blessing.
[time=2914] Like disobedience is its own curse.
[time=2916] We get the great joy someday of doing the things,
[time=2923] those righteous deeds, giving them over to him, like a bride is given to her husband.
[time=2931] Who gives this woman to be married to this man?
[time=2933] It's a wedding picture.
[time=2936] It's a fantastic picture of the way God loves his people.
[time=2940] And we are called as husbands to love our wives the way Christ loved us and purchased us by his blood.
[time=2948] There's Jewish weddings, our wonderful images, this image of this betrothal period, then the interval of waiting, then the dowry is given, then you have this great days-long feast, feast.
[time=2961] Let's suffer, feast, long table, good stuff.
[time=2966] This is what God is, this picture is being painted, this dowry is given in the person of Christ.
[time=2974] Look at, let her be there in your outline again.
[time=2977] Readiness and righteous deeds.
[time=2981] C.S. Lewis said this in mere Christianity, I think it will be in the screens.
[time=2988] When we talk of a man doing anything for God or giving anything to him, I will tell you what it's like.
[time=2994] It's like a small child going to his father and saying, "Daddy, give me six pence to buy you a birthday present." Of course, his father does, and he is pleased with the child's present.
[time=3004] It's all very nice and proper, but only an idiot would think the father is six pence to the good on the transaction.
[time=3011] When I give my righteous deeds over to him as a gift,
[time=3018] I am the better for it, not him.
[time=3019] I can't improve God by my obedience.
[time=3023] He gives me the great joy and pleasure of participating in his kingdom with my righteous deeds.
[time=3030] And the application as we walk out these doors in a few moments is to make yourself ready in the new year.
[time=3040] Let that be our resolution together, that we would resolve to participate in what is described in Romans 12.
[time=3048] Offering our bias as living sacrifices to him, that the world will see in Philippians, too, Paul says that God works in us to willing to work for his own good pleasure.
[time=3061] And we're involved in that process together, folks.
[time=3063] It is a great, it's the great joy of our lives.
[time=3066] Lastly, let her see.
[time=3069] The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
[time=3075] Do you see what it says there in verse nine?
[time=3077] The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
[time=3080] Verse nine says, the angel said to me, write this.
[time=3083] Blessed.
[time=3084] Blessed is the same word in the beatitudes.
[time=3086] Macarias, happy.
[time=3089] The blissful and contented condition of the redeemed soul.
[time=3092] Blessed.
[time=3093] These are the true words of God.
[time=3099] Any journey through Barnes and Noble will let you know that there are lots of people who do not think the Bible is the true words of God.
[time=3106] There's a book end here, guys.
[time=3111] All his judgments are true and just.
[time=3113] These are the true words of God.
[time=3116] The Bible is not a work of fiction.
[time=3120] Okay, I was still nervous there for a second.
[time=3125] Wow.
[time=3127] Despite what Babylon says, it's thousands of years old.
[time=3134] It's outdated.
[time=3134] It's been copied thousands of times.
[time=3136] It's not reliable.
[time=3138] What does the Bible say about itself?
[time=3140] That's a conversation for another day.
[time=3145] As Melissa comes this morning,
[time=3151] verse 10 says, the testimony of Jesus
[time=3157] is the spirit of prophecy.
[time=3159] And I'll share with you something about that.
[time=3162] It means something like this.
[time=3167] All the things that Jesus says are true and all the things said about him from his word are also true.
[time=3173] All the things that he says are true
[time=3179] and all the things said about him in his word are also true.
[time=3184] Melissa's gonna sing for us a song that paints this picture of the wedding feast of the lamb.
[time=3190] I invite you to enjoy, as she sings, and respond to God in that way.
[time=3194] Enjoy his great goodness.
[time=3214] [MUSIC - 266 seconds]
