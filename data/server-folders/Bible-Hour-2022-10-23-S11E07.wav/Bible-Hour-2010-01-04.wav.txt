[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well good morning and welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It's great to be with you.
[time=35] And as I sit here this morning on a Sunday morning, January 3rd, I have been reminded already in just these last couple of days how many people there are, myself included, who at the beginning of any given year are so committed and devoted to trying new things.
[time=54] I've heard people say already to me how this year they're going to get in shape.
[time=58] I've heard people say how this year they're going to spend more time with their family.
[time=63] I've heard all kinds of New Year's resolutions, if you will.
[time=67] And it reminds me as I think about it that while those things are significant and in many cases appropriate, there are in a lot of people's lives, myself included.
[time=78] There are in a lot of people's day-to-day lives some things going on that really, truly need changing.
[time=86] I think about our ministry here at Black Hawk called Celebrate Recovery.
[time=90] And I think about the many, many people who have been impacted by it, a Christ-centered, scripture-based recovery program for those facing the challenge of recovering from addiction.
[time=105] Addiction recovery is something that goes far beyond narcotics and alcohol.
[time=110] There are those who struggle with anger.
[time=117] There are those who struggle with pornography and internet purchasing and all kinds of things that can, if allowed, grip us to the point where we become useless in terms of what God designed us to do and the way God designed us to live.
[time=134] And we at Black Hawk would love nothing more than to offer you.
[time=138] And whatever struggle you might have, the opportunity to walk a path toward freedom, a path toward recovery.
[time=146] And I wanna just make a personal invitation to you.
[time=149] Whoever you are, you may wear a coat and tie to work.
[time=153] You may work in a factory.
[time=154] You may not be working at all.
[time=156] There may be things going on in the depths of your soul that many people know about.
[time=161] There may be things going on that no one knows about.
[time=164] I wanna just encourage you to think about coming on a Friday night at 7 p.m. right here on our South Campus to celebrate recovery.
[time=172] A great, great opportunity.
[time=175] It's run by a team of people who have been there who know the struggles, the real struggles of this life.
[time=180] And they'd love nothing more than to come alongside you and give you the encouragement and the accountability needed to be all that God called you and intended you to be.
[time=190] It's made a huge difference in my own life.
[time=192] I'm so thankful for the freedom that God is giving me from some of the addictions that I have struggled with for years.
[time=198] And we can't wait to meet you.
[time=201] We can't wait to meet your friends.
[time=203] Come by yourself.
[time=203] Come with some others that you know who could use some help and will enjoy seeing God build into your life.
[time=212] The ability to move away from patterns of sin toward patterns of obedience and life.
[time=218] Hey, God bless you.
[time=219] Happy New Year.
[time=220] I hope it's a meaningful and fruitful one for you.
[time=222] And we'd love to be a part of that with you in the days to come.
[time=226] God bless and have a great week.
[time=228] Sweetest frame, but holding lead on Jesus's name.
[time=235] When darkness seems to hide his face,
[time=243] I rest on his unchanging grace.
[time=248] When every high can storm me gale, my anchor holds within the pain.
[time=261] Oh, in Christ's masala rock, I stand.
[time=266] All out of the ground is sinking sand.
[time=275] Let's stand together and sing this next part
[time=282] about his oath and his covenant.
[time=285] Hope his covenant, his blood support me in the well-made fight.
[time=294] When all the round my soul gives way, he then is all my hope and stay.
[time=307] On Christ's masala rock, I stand.
[time=313] All out of the ground is sinking sand.
[time=321] When he shall come, when he shall come with trumpet sound.
[time=336] Oh, may I then, in him be found, dressed in his righteousness alone.
[time=345] For let's to stand before the throne.
[time=366] [MUSIC]
[time=376] Sing that chorus again.
[time=379] Oh, in Christ's masala rock, I stand.
[time=384] All out of the ground is sinking sand.
[time=395] We're going to sing another part of that song we just did.
[time=404] From rescue, it says, "This world has nothing for me." Oh, Christ, the solid rock I stand is reminiscent of a beautiful parable that Jesus told.
[time=414] And he said, "If you obey my teachings, and if you put them into practice, you'll be like a house built on solid ground.
[time=422] But if you ignore my teachings, and if you ignore putting them into practice, then you're going to be like the house that was built on shifting sand." The other song says it this way.
[time=433] This world has nothing for me.
[time=435] And we're going to sing that a few times together.
[time=437] And when you think about this world, think about this world and its philosophies.
[time=441] Think about this world and the lies that it teaches us about the truth of who Jesus is.
[time=446] The lies that it tells us to ignore Jesus' teaching in this world lies to us.
[time=450] And it tells us that we should not put into practice the things that Jesus says to put into practice.
[time=457] And as we sing this a few times together, let's renew with one another a commitment to follow Jesus' ways and to follow Jesus' teaching and to put his laws into practice and to be like a people built on a solid rock.
[time=472] This world has nothing for me.
[time=508] This world, this world has nothing for me.
[time=515] This world has nothing for me.
[time=524] As I need you, Jesus, to come to my rescue.
[time=531] Where else can I go?
[time=536] There's no other name I wish I would say.
[time=544] Capture me with grace.
[time=549] As I need you, Jesus, to come to my rescue.
[time=556] Where else can I go?
[time=561] There's no other name I wish I would say.
[time=569] Capture me with grace.
[time=588] I will follow you.
[time=613] Hey, you know when I was in college,
[time=625] which was a long time ago, we used to look out our window in the dorms.
[time=632] I went to a couple different colleges, but there's this one that comes to my mind.
[time=636] It was the last one I went to, the Masters College out in LA.
[time=640] It was a great place filled with great memories.
[time=643] At the Masters College, they had dorms that kind of made a square around a quad area and you could look out that quad area and see people mingling.
[time=652] At one point in time, somebody put a nice little gazebo in this quad area.
[time=657] If you relate to this, this isn't by any stretch and experience unique to just me, and I'm sure most of you are familiar with this phrase.
[time=664] Every once in a while, you'd see a guy and a gal around campus who all of a sudden were spending a little bit more time with each other.
[time=672] You'd all of a sudden see him together at the cafeteria, and then you'd see him together at the library, and then you'd see him together at different events and then people would start to talk, and you'd wonder what was going on with Jimmy and Susie or whoever it was.
[time=686] Well, many times it happened over the course of those days.
[time=690] You'd look out your dorm window at night in the evening, and all of a sudden you'd see Jimmy and Susie heading to the gazebo, because it was time for the DTR talk.
[time=706] You know what DTR stands for?
[time=708] Defining the relationship.
[time=710] It was time to figure out where they were going.
[time=712] It was time to figure out how they were going to get there.
[time=715] It was time to talk about how they felt, and we'd always watch from the window, and oftentimes the DTR talk would begin with, you know, a little bit of space between them, and oftentimes it would end with there being no space and them praying together or whatever they would do there at the end.
[time=730] But it was about defining the relationship.
[time=732] It was about kind of setting a course, and I was thinking about it this week.
[time=736] I really feel like, with 2010, out in front of us, it's not really a gazebo, but it's sort of like a gazebo, and I knew we'd all be here, and I just felt like maybe, if you'd give me the freedom to do it, I thought we could have a little talk this morning.
[time=752] I think it's important, actually, that we have a talk this morning about what may be ahead for us in the year 2010.
[time=762] You give me the privilege every week to teach, and there's nothing really.
[time=768] There's a few things in life I enjoy more than the privilege you've given me to stand up here each week and do my best with his help to explain what the scriptures say.
[time=778] Every once in a while, you give me the freedom to just kind of put on a sweater, so to speak, light the fire, and have a chat, and this morning I want to have a talk.
[time=787] And there'll be some teaching, I think, inevitably there always is, but there's just some things that I think God has put on our hearts as leaders.
[time=796] There are some things that we've been talking about.
[time=798] Most of this won't be new, but I sense in my spirit, as I look at you and think about these next 12 months, the need for us to just say some things and talk about some things and further solidify and further clarify the relationship.
[time=815] And the opportunity God's given us to be a part of his amazing kingdom work, so I've tried to just capture it.
[time=823] I know I've probably failed miserably.
[time=825] I've tried to capture a lot of what's in my heart and on my mind these days with three questions.
[time=831] And so if you would just follow along with me this morning, three questions that I believe Blackhawk must ask.
[time=838] And I'm implying here that we've got to answer these questions as well, but three questions that I believe Blackhawk must ask in the year 2010.
[time=849] And I hope you'll follow along with me and I'm looking forward to what God's going to do as we talk this through.
[time=857] Number one, question number one, will we sacrifice as a family?
[time=863] Will we sacrifice individually and will we sacrifice?
[time=866] Will we even innovate if we have to?
[time=869] Will we get creative if God were to push us in that direction?
[time=875] But will we as a family sacrifice in the coming days and weeks and months in order to be debt-free, debt-free by December 31st, 2010?
[time=889] You say, "Wow, you're just 2010 big kind of New Year's message and you're going to start with money, huh?" Well, you know what?
[time=898] Yeah, but I hope in just these next couple of minutes, I really hope that you would see that a discussion for this family in this day about debt-free living is so much more.
[time=913] It goes so far beyond just money.
[time=916] And I want to kind of help you figure that out.
[time=918] Many of you have already discovered it.
[time=920] Others of you, maybe today, this will be a new learning for you.
[time=923] But let me just say it to you this way.
[time=924] Two years ago, we as a family made a commitment to try and, with God's help, completely erase a $2.2 million debt.
[time=934] The hope was, and the commitment was to try and do that in a three-year span.
[time=940] We called this project, "Wet Cement." It was a great picture in our minds of an opportunity for God to reshape and remold and recast our ministry and to do it in the midst of financial freedom
[time=955] instead of financial bondage.
[time=957] It was a three-year project.
[time=959] The idea was to raise funds through commitments from you to eliminate our debt and refurbish the North Campus.
[time=968] It was an exciting time, and I'm here to tell you, and again, most of you have read the letters, and some of you have heard the announcements and months gone by, but so far, over the course of the last two years, in tough economic times, in difficult financial days,
[time=986] the family at Blackhawk, towards the elimination of debt, so far we've seen a million, $30,513 come in.
[time=997] I think on your bulletin there, the "Wet Cement" numbers different.
[time=1000] Again, that number you see on your bulletin is total "Wet Cement" as it relates to eliminating the debt, a million, 30, 513, which leaves us with just a little bit over $1.1 million left
[time=1015] to pay off.
[time=1018] Now, most of you who know me know that I don't think -- I don't spend a lot of time thinking about numbers.
[time=1024] I'm not what you would call a numbers guy, but I'll tell you what, to be real honest with you in real forthright, which is what I'm trying to be here, I think about these numbers, I think about those numbers all the time.
[time=1041] I think about those numbers a lot.
[time=1044] I think about them, I pray about them, we as a team think about ways to continue to address this and come at this.
[time=1054] It intrigues me, it excites me, it thrills me, it fires me up,
[time=1061] it confuses me at times, but I tell you, those numbers and what they mean absolutely grip me.
[time=1070] And here's why.
[time=1072] Because, and I've told you this before, again, some of you know this, others of you don't.
[time=1076] When we are debt free, when that mortgage has been paid off
[time=1082] and there's no more debt, here at Blackout Ministries, we will on a monthly basis realize an infusion of $15,200.
[time=1096] On a monthly basis, that's what we're paying today toward debt.
[time=1101] That's over $182,000 a year.
[time=1109] For some of you, I don't know, that may not seem like a lot of money.
[time=1112] For me, that feels like an enormous amount of money.
[time=1117] $15,000 a month, over $180,000 a year.
[time=1122] Do you understand what this could mean?
[time=1127] Do you understand what this could mean, and I don't so much mean for us?
[time=1131] Do you understand what this could mean for others?
[time=1139] Do you understand what this could mean for God's efforts, those efforts that he cares most about?
[time=1149] I wrote a few things down here.
[time=1153] And by no means is this complete.
[time=1157] By no means is this a to-do list for our ministry.
[time=1160] I'm not speaking in final draft form here from our elders to you.
[time=1164] I'm just sharing with you perspective, and I want you to think with me.
[time=1168] And I want us to develop our own vision and understanding of what could transpire in the midst of being financially free.
[time=1178] I was thinking about the enzymes that we have been talking about for the last four or five weeks.
[time=1184] Corbin announced to you all, those of you who were here on Christmas Eve, that after four weeks, the above and beyond giving gift that you as a family gave came to over just over $21,000.
[time=1198] We're given by this family in an above and beyond way to provide barrels of cleaning solutions, cleaning enzymes to go over to clean surgical instruments in third world countries.
[time=1212] That $21,000 at three cents a surgery is going to save.
[time=1221] Is going to save thousands and thousands and thousands of lives?
[time=1228] And I don't say that with pride, I don't say that with arrogance, I don't say that with utter humility and wonder, at the opportunities that are out there for you and I, in tangible real ways, make a difference because of your graciousness and because of your willingness to give.
[time=1247] Three cents a surgery, how far would a portion of $182,000 go in saving lives?
[time=1257] The name that the organization gave itself that we worked with, real religion.
[time=1263] God said real religion, real religion is the kind that comes alongside
[time=1271] and cares for widows and orphans and those in need.
[time=1277] Did you hear that?
[time=1280] Real religion, the kind that stirs and moves the heart of God is the kind that comes alongside those and cares for those, widows and orphans and those in need.
[time=1293] I thought about our own Blackhawk missionaries.
[time=1295] You know, my friends, we've got almost, Bill, what do we have, 40?
[time=1300] Linda?
[time=1302] About 30 missionaries that are part of our family that we've sent over the years.
[time=1308] Many of them we've sent 25, 30 years ago, some we've sent in the last few years.
[time=1313] But there are friends of ours, my friends, who are priests who have gone.
[time=1317] They're giving their lives to real religion all over the world.
[time=1322] They're planting churches and making disciples and feeding the hungry and clothing those without and giving water to those who are thirsty.
[time=1331] And they do it on way more than they should ever think about doing it on.
[time=1337] The amount of support that we give while we try to be gracious and generous just isn't.
[time=1343] And I think about what a portion of $180,000 a year could achieve and accomplish
[time=1349] in the lives of dear friends of ours who today are struggling across the world and here in Fort Wayne and some here in the States.
[time=1358] Wow, what a difference that could make in their lives and in their ministries.
[time=1363] I think about my friends.
[time=1367] Our friends, some of you have been there.
[time=1370] I hope many of you will go with me as we go back again and again in the days to come.
[time=1375] But I think about our friends in Nairobi.
[time=1377] I think about Clive and Mary and the new life orphanage there.
[time=1382] From the satellite sites around Kenya.
[time=1385] And I think about this unspeakable challenge of saving and rescuing the born infants who have been thrown into the sewer pipes and tossed into the bush and discarded in the garbage heaps.
[time=1398] I think about these little lives just clinging to life.
[time=1402] I think about the infection of HIV and how many of them are hopelessly and terminally infected.
[time=1410] Others aren't but in need of love and care.
[time=1413] And I think about the chance that God's given us over these last two years to build a relationship with Clive and Mary and that team.
[time=1419] And think about the orphanage that they have.
[time=1422] One of their satellite sites in Mumbasa over on the coast of Kenya.
[time=1428] Our own Sarah Rogers has spent time there.
[time=1431] She has not only been with us to Nairobi but has gone on her own to Mumbasa two or three times.
[time=1438] And she came back this last time with the sad news that the Mumbasa orphanage, which cares for abandoned AIDS infected babies, there in Mumbasa is closing.
[time=1447] Because of lack of funds.
[time=1450] They just don't have enough money. They just can't keep it open.
[time=1454] And now they're scrambling to somehow try and find homes for these little babies.
[time=1459] They're sick and alone and it's an incredibly discouraging situation.
[time=1464] And I don't know, I think a portion of a hundred and eighty thousand dollars would have made a difference.
[time=1472] And that's all in God's hands and his timing.
[time=1475] And I'm trying to help you and I understand what could be.
[time=1480] I'm trying to help you and I understand what it would be like to be free and able to write a check or send funds or send more people.
[time=1489] I got a friend who's incredibly passionate.
[time=1491] You know how you get passionate and I get passionate about different things.
[time=1494] I got a buddy who's incredibly passionate about those who die hundreds of thousands of people.
[time=1499] You know this die every year because they don't have water.
[time=1504] They don't have a drink of water. They got nothing.
[time=1509] And he's passionate about drilling water wells.
[time=1513] And did you know that a water well that could be dug with the proper technology
[time=1521] that's available almost effortlessly?
[time=1524] A water well that could feed over a hundred thousand people for three to five years.
[time=1531] It costs four thousand dollars.
[time=1534] That's it.
[time=1536] Four thousand dollars, dig a well.
[time=1539] Give over a hundred thousand people water for three to five years.
[time=1542] Save lives.
[time=1545] It's incredible.
[time=1547] I was reading just this week, have other friends who are passionate about this cause.
[time=1552] It's something I've seen for myself in Nairobi.
[time=1556] Mosquito nets.
[time=1558] I'm the fight against malaria.
[time=1560] Are you familiar with this?
[time=1563] Millions of people in America aren't.
[time=1565] But the fact of the matter is in third world countries this year in 2010, which we kick off in a sense here this morning, this year in 2010, 800,000 children, 800,000 kids under the age of 12 will die this year from a mosquito bite.
[time=1584] From malaria, 800,000 children under the age of 12 will die.
[time=1589] Over a million people total will die because they didn't have a mosquito net that costs four fifty.
[time=1603] A mosquito net costs four fifty.
[time=1608] That's less than a venti mocha.
[time=1613] And that's an indictment not on you, but on me.
[time=1618] I think about Fort Wayne.
[time=1620] I do think about Nairobi.
[time=1622] And I do think about wells, water wells in East Africa.
[time=1626] And I do think about kids who will die because they didn't have a net that costs four fifty.
[time=1630] But I also think about our own city.
[time=1632] I think about this community.
[time=1633] This ever changing demographic right here at State and Lamire.
[time=1637] I think about the enormous number of immigrants that Fort Wayne has the privilege of housing these days.
[time=1643] I think about the vine right out here in your own church on that arbor out there, those carts.
[time=1651] And the hundreds of dollars, probably, it's about it.
[time=1655] The hundreds of dollars out there that represent real people and real lives who are in real need today.
[time=1661] I'm not sure how they're going to make it to the middle of January.
[time=1665] And you know what else I think about?
[time=1667] When I think about a hundred and eighty thousand dollars a year, I think about fifteen thousand, two hundred a month.
[time=1671] I can't help but think about our school.
[time=1675] You think, well, wait a minute.
[time=1676] Now you just lost me.
[time=1677] We were talking about mosquito nets and kids dying in Africa.
[time=1680] And now you're talking about black hot Christian school.
[time=1682] That's right.
[time=1683] I think about our school, which has for thirty five forty years been.
[time=1688] And we've said it from the very beginning and we continue to say it today and it's still the truth today.
[time=1693] It's one of the most significant ministry opportunities we have to, as priests, pass along God to kids and those who come with kids called family.
[time=1703] And we have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of kids in this neighborhood, in this community.
[time=1711] And those who give leadership at our school and those who give leadership here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1716] We think a lot about these days how we're going to continue to offer a life-changing education.
[time=1724] In the midst of tough economic times with a lot of families, more and more so these days, who can't afford five thousand dollars a year.
[time=1733] And we either at some point become elite and high-end and only about those who can afford an ever increasing tuition scale.
[time=1744] Or we get creative or we get financially and fiscally smart and that's going to take a lot of other folks besides me.
[time=1753] And we have to figure out a way to offer the most significant ministry of this church in ways that are affordable.
[time=1760] In ways that make it possible for a lot of families in this community to come and experience the love of Christ.
[time=1770] From the transformation that comes when a young heart is educated and trained and discipled in a God-loving Christ-centered environment.
[time=1780] [AMEN] We got to figure that out.
[time=1783] I don't know that a portion of a hundred and eighty thousand dollars a year solves that problem.
[time=1788] But it sure would help.
[time=1791] It sure could make a difference in the lives of some.
[time=1795] You know, I was thinking about it this week.
[time=1797] What if, and I say that just what if, and thanks for letting me say what if every once in a while.
[time=1803] Again, this isn't final draft, but what if, what if, what if black-caught ministries over these next few years will say.
[time=1815] What if we moved in our efforts to give and meet the, what if we moved toward real religion, book of James, widows, orphans, those in need.
[time=1824] What if we gave away?
[time=1827] We give away ten percent of our budget right now.
[time=1829] Did most of you know that?
[time=1830] We give away toward missional, compassion efforts, ten percent of our budget every year.
[time=1837] It's a good thing.
[time=1838] [AMEN] What if we gave away twenty?
[time=1843] What if we gave away thirty?
[time=1846] What if elders and leaders and gifted bright people in this arena got together and continued to help us streamline our budget and, and shave operating costs and get creative with how we do ministry.
[time=1860] What if we got to a point where black-caught ministries gave away fifty percent?
[time=1866] I mean, what if we really challenged ourselves and opened our hearts to what God would want us to do on that front.
[time=1873] I'm praying, I'm praying that God would help us be debt-free by December 31st, 2010.
[time=1881] And there are some of you here in the room who weren't here two years ago.
[time=1885] And you didn't make a commitment to what's in it.
[time=1888] And you know what?
[time=1889] Maybe you'd, maybe you'd be willing to.
[time=1891] Maybe it is home for you today.
[time=1893] Maybe as I share these things with you this morning, there is a stirring in your heart to partner with this family in giving above and beyond to an effort that's as great.
[time=1902] And as good and as awesome as what you've just heard.
[time=1906] You could call us at the office.
[time=1908] You can come by and see Mark Orange.
[time=1910] You can call me.
[time=1911] You can email us.
[time=1912] You can find us.
[time=1913] We'd love to help you get established in a regular giving pattern toward this endeavor over these next twelve months.
[time=1923] There are some of you watching the broadcast today.
[time=1926] Not in the room.
[time=1928] And you have, even in tough times, you have economic resources.
[time=1934] You have the ability to make a significant dent in 1.1 million dollars.
[time=1941] I wonder if God would move in your heart to help this family move in this direction.
[time=1947] You know what?
[time=1948] There are some of you in the room and your gift might be small.
[time=1952] But your small gift might be sacrificial for you and that gift would mean just as much to the kingdom as a big one.
[time=1960] From a big giver with lots of resources.
[time=1962] Make sense?
[time=1963] Pray with me.
[time=1965] Let's work together.
[time=1967] Let's see what God will do.
[time=1969] Let's innovate if we have to.
[time=1970] You got some ideas?
[time=1971] Tell us.
[time=1972] And let's see if maybe by the end of this year we could be in the midst of financial and fiscal freedom and the ability to do some amazing things.
[time=1981] Question two, will we pursue you and I together?
[time=1985] Will we as a leadership?
[time=1987] Will you as a family?
[time=1989] Will we at Blackhawk pursue without compromise?
[time=1993] Both the making of disciples and the process of becoming disciples?
[time=2000] Will we pursue without compromise, my friends?
[time=2004] I had one of my kids telling me just the other day, Dad, you keep talking about the same things at church.
[time=2011] Could you mix it up a little bit?
[time=2014] And that's a good reminder.
[time=2016] It was good to hear.
[time=2017] But on this front, and I've said this before, and I'm going to say it again, on this front, I'm going to keep talking about this.
[time=2024] And we're going to keep teaching about this.
[time=2027] In Matthew 28, my friends, as Jesus prepares to leave, He says to His disciples with all of redemptive history right on their doorstep, with the birth of the church right around the corner.
[time=2039] Jesus leaving, looks at these guys and says, one thing, go and make one thing.
[time=2049] He could have told them to go and make five things.
[time=2052] Couldn't have.
[time=2054] He told them to go and make one thing.
[time=2059] And the one thing He said, guys, go make this, was what?
[time=2064] Say it.
[time=2065] Disciples.
[time=2067] Imitators of me, followers of the Son of God, go make disciples.
[time=2077] How many things have you and I have been trying to make over the years?
[time=2084] Colossians 128's become a central text, and just a tremendous reminder for many of us in leadership here at Blackock.
[time=2091] And I know for some of you, you can turn there if you'd like.
[time=2094] Colossians 128, Paul captures this.
[time=2097] Paul knew what was going on here. He had this in his heart.
[time=2100] Paul says, we proclaim in all of Paul's proclaiming.
[time=2104] And many of you know that Paul proclaimed a lot.
[time=2106] Here's a man who preached and taught in birth churches and made disciples.
[time=2111] And Paul says at the end of the day, when it's all said and done, we proclaim him.
[time=2116] We proclaim Jesus Christ. He says in verse 28 Colossians 1, we proclaim him.
[time=2122] Admonishing every man as we proclaim him.
[time=2125] Teaching every man as we proclaim him with all wisdom so that we may present every man.
[time=2132] Paul knew at the end of the day his ministry.
[time=2135] Paul knew at the end of the day his efforts would be assessed by the presence of or the absence of.
[time=2142] Read it there for yourself in the text so that we may present every man complete in Christ.
[time=2150] Completed believers, disciples, imitators of Jesus.
[time=2159] The word there complete means mature. Paul says here, and I've told you this before.
[time=2164] He didn't want them. At the end of the day he wasn't interested in making spiritual toddlers.
[time=2170] He wanted them to move beyond spiritual adolescence.
[time=2174] He wanted desperately for them to experience and know what it was like to be grown-ups in their faith.
[time=2181] Completed and mature.
[time=2184] And I'm supposed to be, I'm supposed to be, and we're supposed to be as leaders and elders here.
[time=2190] We're supposed to be helping you, not hindering you, we're supposed to be helping you down this path.
[time=2197] Along this road, a disciple, a fully devoted, not partially, fully surrendered follower or imitator of Jesus.
[time=2207] First Corinthians 11-1, it's not going to be on the screen.
[time=2211] I asked him to do it that way because I love hearing the sound of pages turning.
[time=2216] So, would you open to 1 Corinthians 11-1 for anybody in the room who might be sitting there going okay now?
[time=2221] Wait a minute, you're kind of camping on this following theme.
[time=2224] You're kind of camping on this imitate me theme.
[time=2227] Did you just come up with this kelly or is there some substance, some foundation for this?
[time=2234] Go to 1 Corinthians 11-1. Paul says there in 1 Corinthians 11-1.
[time=2238] It's good to hear the pages turning. Thanks.
[time=2240] Be imitators, Paul says of me. Paul says be imitators of me just as I also, Paul am imitating who?
[time=2249] Christ. Paul knew it, Paul understood it.
[time=2253] That was the gig, imitate Jesus.
[time=2257] Imitate his words, imitate his thinking, imitate his actions, imitate his principles and his values.
[time=2263] Those things that governed his life imitate those things. Paul says imitate me just as I also am of Christ.
[time=2273] Go to Matthew, first book in the New Testament. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. Go to Matthew chapter 4.
[time=2281] Come on, turn those pages really hard. Let me hear it. Yeah, that's cool.
[time=2286] I like that. Matthew 4, 18. Matthew 4, 18, it says this.
[time=2293] Now as Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee, do you see it there? Matthew 4, 18.
[time=2298] He saw two brothers, Simon who was called Peter and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea for they were what?
[time=2307] Say it. Fisherman. And he said to them, verse 9, he said to them, first thing he says to them is follow me.
[time=2317] Come and see what I do. Come and learn what I teach.
[time=2322] Come and travel with me. Come and sleep with me. Come and eat with me.
[time=2326] Follow me. Come and imitate me. Mimic me. What the word means?
[time=2334] Follow me and I will make you fishers of what? Okay, make a note there. I want to come back to that.
[time=2343] If I get to the end of the message and I haven't come back to that, somebody raise your hand and say, wait, you didn't come back to fishers of men.
[time=2349] But I want to come back to that at the end. He says, follow me and I will make you fishers of men, verse 20.
[time=2355] Immediately they left their nets because that's what disciples do. Immediately they left their nets and what? Say it. Followed him.
[time=2365] Go to Matthew 16. Matthew 16, not a real popular passage. It's one that oftentimes in all honesty we avoid, but it's the truth and it gives us great insight into the DNA of a disciple, the intent and the design that God had for those who would follow after his son.
[time=2386] 16, 24. Here you go. Then Jesus said to his disciples, if anyone wishes to come after me, if you want to follow me, if you want to mimic me, if you want to imitate me, if anyone wishes to come after me,
[time=2401] he must deny himself and take up his pain, take up his torment, take up his being misunderstood, take up his loneliness, take up the scoffing that will come,
[time=2415] take up the loneliness of standing for what's true, take up your what? Cross.
[time=2423] If you're going to follow me, he says, then you have to deny yourself, take up your cross and follow me for whoever wishes to save his life,
[time=2434] who in the room wants to have your life saved, raise your hand, then God's word says you have to lose it.
[time=2442] But whoever loses his life, for my sake, well what? We'll find it.
[time=2449] We'll find it. John 10, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. Go ahead, turn those pages for me. John 10, John 10, 24.
[time=2460] Here Jesus finds himself in a situation he often finds himself in. He's with a bunch of Jews who don't like what he's doing and questions are flying back and forth.
[time=2471] John 10, 24, the Jews then gathered around him and were saying to him, how long will you keep us in suspense as if there was any suspense?
[time=2482] There wasn't any suspense. They just didn't get it. They said, how long are you going to keep us in suspense?
[time=2486] If you are the Christ, tell us plainly, and Jesus answered them plainly in my opinion. I just threw that in there.
[time=2497] I told you, and you do not believe the works that I do in my father's name, these testify to me. They testify to me being the Christ.
[time=2512] The problem isn't that I haven't been playing with you. The problem is, verse 26, but you do not what? Say it. Believe.
[time=2521] Because you are not of my sheep. And here it gets dicey. It gets a little indicting here. You and I have got to be careful with this.
[time=2531] You got to listen and think this through. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they, my sheep, they follow me.
[time=2546] My sheep follow me. They do what I do. They live like I live. They value what I value. They led by the principles that led me.
[time=2556] My sheep follow me. See what it says there? And I give eternal life to them, and they, my sheep, the ones that follow me, they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
[time=2572] Those who, what? Those who follow. Revelation 14, 4. Here referring to the 144,000, which is a longer discussion than we can get into this morning, but I want to just read you what he says about these dear people.
[time=2590] Revelation 14, back at the very back of your New Testament 14th chapter of Revelation 4th verse said, "These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they have kept themselves chased.
[time=2605] These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb, and no lie was found in their mouth.
[time=2621] But they are blameless. These who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. Disciples, my friends, imitators of Jesus, those who follow after him, who does God use to bring about change?
[time=2641] It's always been this way, from the inception of the church, those who follow after his son, who does God use to transform and redeem the world followers of his son.
[time=2653] Jesus imitators, I believe, and I may get in trouble for saying this, and I trust that you all will be understanding of the spirit with which I say this.
[time=2665] I want to say it. I think it's true. I'm not going to apologize for it. And let me just say it, and hopefully at the end you'll understand the thrust of what I'm trying to communicate.
[time=2676] I believe my friends on this front. It's where the church has failed. I believe it's where our church has failed. I believe it's where the church has failed for years and years, maybe decades.
[time=2692] And here's what I mean. You see, for years, the evangelical church has been utterly and absolutely devoted, make no mistake, to making a number of things.
[time=2706] The church has for years been devoted to, and you can write these down. They've been devoted to making Bible studiers. Bible studiers.
[time=2715] Now, somebody in the room, raise your hand if you think that's a bad thing to be made into. Anybody? That's a good thing. Amen?
[time=2723] Problem is that in some places, in some settings, that's it. That's all we got made into. Was Bible studiers. We just became good Bible studiers.
[time=2736] And the Bible's a good thing to study, and the truth's a good thing to know. But Jesus didn't say, "Hey guys, before I go, listen, go make Bible studiers."
[time=2747] For years and years, the church has been devoted to making, in some settings, in some situations, theologians. Did you know this?
[time=2756] In some settings, in some places, that's been the thrust. Is theology, is doctrine, a bad thing to understand? Anybody? No. Not a bad thing at all.
[time=2769] It can get to be a bit misguided, though, when it's the only thing that's on one's mind or heart.
[time=2777] And the church has done a good job of making theologians, many of whom will fight for the truth. Divide for the truth.
[time=2788] Jesus said, "Hey, I'm leaving. I want you to go do one thing. Make theologians know."
[time=2796] For years, the church, the evangelical church, has been devoted to making, and this third one, I would say in recent years, in my lifetime.
[time=2805] In the last 20, 25 years, you've heard a lot of this, leaders. The church has been doing a great job and been putting enormous amounts of emphasis and time and resources into the development of leaders.
[time=2817] Those who can cast vision, even a biblical vision, and those who have the ability, because of the gifts God's given them, to systematize and prioritize and put together in strategic ways that are fruitful and good, ministry endeavors.
[time=2832] Anything wrong with that? Anything wrong with being made into a leader? No, it's just a problem when it's the only thing, when it's the one thing, or when it's the main thing.
[time=2846] For years, the evangelical church has been devoted to making Bible studyers, theologians, and leaders.
[time=2852] Here's one, again, in my lifetime. Some of you who are older in the room have really seen this shift, but it's been an enormous emphasis in the church that last 30, 40 years.
[time=2862] Worshipers. Oh, we've learned a lot about worship, and we've, over the years, put more and more of a priority on giving those in the arena of the arts, an opportunity to contribute to, and we've lifted up the value of worship.
[time=2878] And we've lifted up the great value of song, and music, and dance, and the arts, and none of that's bad, and to help develop people who are worshipers of God as a good thing, but sometimes it becomes the only thing.
[time=2891] Or the main thing, Bible studyers, and theologians, and leaders, and worshipers.
[time=2897] Here's one more thing the church has for years and years and years been making.
[time=2904] Buildings.
[time=2908] Boy, we got really fascinated with buildings, didn't we?
[time=2914] Big ones. Huge ones, campuses.
[time=2920] We got, we got genuinely kind of, like, we bought into this idea that, you know, you build it, they won't come, and it was well-intending.
[time=2930] Hear me. It was well-intending.
[time=2933] And sometimes we built them because so many people came, we needed more room, and I understand that, but in terms of preoccupation, in terms of priority,
[time=2943] what happened was that in many places that began to be the driving deal, building buildings.
[time=2953] So, in light of all that, what do we got?
[time=2958] We know the text.
[time=2961] We can defend our pre-trib, or our mill, or whatever theological view.
[time=2966] We know how to cast vision and develop strategy. We can sing beautifully and have elaborate cathedrals within which to sing them.
[time=2975] But 800,000 kids.
[time=2979] Under the age of 12, we're going to die this year because they didn't have a $4.50 net.
[time=2986] And we tend to stand around and think it's somebody else's problem.
[time=2994] And I'm not saying today that we shouldn't be Bible-studiers, theologians or worshipers.
[time=3001] I'm saying that Jesus said be disciples.
[time=3006] And when you get a disciple, you get a Bible-studier.
[time=3011] When you get a disciple, you get a worshipper.
[time=3015] When you grow up a disciple, he understands the very doctrine and truth that saved him. Are you with me?
[time=3023] Jesus said do one thing, make disciples.
[time=3026] With great fear and trepidation, we put together a couple years ago as we studied the scriptures.
[time=3033] Many of you know we put together five elements, five principles, five truths that we saw Jesus practice.
[time=3041] And we saw those who came after him practice.
[time=3045] And I want to just remind you of those five things.
[time=3048] The disciples prayerfully abide. They prayerfully, personally, like Jesus did again and again and again.
[time=3054] He slipped away to be by himself with God.
[time=3057] Disciples prayerfully, personally abide.
[time=3061] They are devoted to Scripture.
[time=3063] The Word of God surrounds them.
[time=3065] The Word of God undergirds them.
[time=3067] The Word of God is present constantly in their life.
[time=3070] They depend upon it like Jesus did in the wilderness with Satan tempting him.
[time=3076] Rather than bread fall back on the very words of God.
[time=3080] Disciples, imitators of Jesus, are thoroughly given to these practices and these principles.
[time=3086] Transformational community like Jesus who was engaged in deep, honest, ongoing relationship with a few in his life.
[time=3095] God calls you and I as disciples to live that very same way.
[time=3101] Authentically, honestly, transparently with those who will love and encourage and who you can love and encourage.
[time=3109] Missional serving, going with purpose to those in need, going with the gospel, going with hands and feet that are willing to serve the gospel.
[time=3119] Missional serving and the fifth one there, real devoted, surrendered.
[time=3125] Genuine disciples are utterly committed to making more.
[time=3129] I sometimes think that number five should probably be number one.
[time=3136] I told you I'd come back to this.
[time=3138] I'm so proud of myself that I remembered it.
[time=3141] Jesus said, "Come follow me and I will make you into transformational community."
[time=3148] No.
[time=3149] Jesus said, "Come follow me and I will make you into people devoted to scripture." No.
[time=3155] Jesus said, "Come follow me and I will make you disciple makers.
[time=3165] I will make you into people who are stirred by and passionate about reaching others.
[time=3172] And sometimes we get so caught up in those first four, we forget about the fifth one, makes me want to make the fifth one the first one.
[time=3180] Who are you reaching?
[time=3185] Who are you investing in?
[time=3188] Who are you giving yourself to?
[time=3190] Who's either far from God and needs the whole discipleship package?
[time=3194] Who are you investing in who's come to Christ and needs to grow?
[time=3198] Who are you reaching out to which really leads us to the third one and we got to go because it's late?
[time=3205] But the third question, will you as a priest, will you as a disciple, will you go?
[time=3212] There's so much more to say about this.
[time=3214] Maybe we'll just take a few minutes next week.
[time=3217] Will you go?
[time=3219] I say number two, being devoted to disciple making and being devoted to becoming a disciple leads to three.
[time=3226] I say that because priests who pass along God to others, they do it actively.
[time=3232] You can't help it if you know him and if you're following him and his teachings, it just comes out of you.
[time=3240] You can't be passive, you go, you say go where?
[time=3243] I say you go across the street, you go downtown, you go across the country, you go across the world.
[time=3248] You go, listen, listen, for years the church said to you, when you said where do you want me to go, for years the church gave you a list?
[time=3255] They said go to this ministry or that ministry or this ministry, there's your options.
[time=3260] I'm saying to you, everybody in this room, you better help Janice with kids.
[time=3264] Amen?
[time=3265] All right.
[time=3266] That's just an opportunity, all of us have go help with kids.
[time=3271] All right?
[time=3272] Everybody say I will.
[time=3273] One, two, three.
[time=3274] Liars.
[time=3278] But listen, beyond that, beyond that, the answer is wherever God leads you in your world, in that cubicle, in your neighborhood, in this city with your gifts and your talents, go and pass along his grace and his compassion and his kindness and his truth.
[time=3307] And we'll celebrate that Black Hawk Ministries will be made up of Black Hawk Ministers, wherever you are, whoever you are, we got this wrong for years, go.
[time=3322] Tell us about it.
[time=3323] Let us celebrate that.
[time=3328] I got a list of people in my life who are doing this, and I just can't wait to tell you about it.
[time=3334] Maybe I'll write you.
[time=3335] Are you all on the email list?
[time=3337] Get on that email list.
[time=3338] Maybe I'll write it to you this week, but we've got to figure out the debt thing.
[time=3345] You and I have got to draw a line in the sand and say, "You know what?
[time=3348] I'm going to become more of a disciple and be devoted to making them, and I'm going to give you more.
[time=3354] We're going to give you more on this in the days to come, and we've got to be a people who go."
[time=3361] Amen?
[time=3362] [AMEN] Thanks for letting me do that.
[time=3364] I appreciate it immensely.
[time=3365] Would you stand?
[time=3366] And let me pray for us.
[time=3370] As we take our Father God be with us, a people who would, many of us in the room today, we would love nothing more than to experience you transforming our lives and our worlds and our perspectives as we would give ourselves wholly.
[time=3388] And that's the deal.
[time=3390] So many God in the room, many listening via the broadcast, so many of us at times just think we can somehow give you a little or a part of us.
[time=3405] Oh God, may we repent of that sin, and may we in our repentance throw ourselves all of us at your feet, and may we surrender to you completely and wholly so that God you can use us so that you can transform us and send us as priests willing to pass you along to others.
[time=3429] Move us please, God, in this direction and all the people in the room agreed and said, amen.
[time=3435] Tim and Lisa Marker are celebrating their recent 15th wedding anniversary today as day sponsors of the Bible Hour.
