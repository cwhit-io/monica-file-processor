[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=33] It's great to have you with us, and it's great to have you with us in 2010.
[time=38] We started out this year last week with a message and a great discussion in the days following that message regarding the three questions that Black Hawk Ministries has to ask in the coming year.
[time=51] And I can't wait for you and the entire Black Hawk family along with our team to begin to answer those questions.
[time=59] It's been a great week of discussion regarding those three questions, and I can't wait to see what God's gonna do.
[time=65] But today we're back to a study that we started a couple, two or three months ago, and it's been about a month or so since we've been in this study of Ephesians.
[time=75] Truth, way, life.
[time=78] The truth, the way, the life.
[time=80] It's been an amazing opportunity for us to dive into one of the most uniquely powerful books in all of Scripture.
[time=86] Ephesians is so powerful, my friends.
[time=89] Let me just remind you of this.
[time=91] It's so powerful because it has six chapters and it's divided right down the middle.
[time=95] First three chapters are all about what God has done for you, what God has done for me in the scope of salvation, all that he has given, all that he has provided, all that he has accomplished.
[time=108] Chapters one, two and three of Ephesians literally paint for you and I this picture of our position, what really has taken place in the midst of your heart and my heart and soul when God redeems us.
[time=123] All that's there, all the potential, all the spiritual capacity that God brings and then four, five and six is that spiritual power, that spiritual capacity, all the changes that God brought lived out.
[time=138] One, two and three is about our position.
[time=141] Chapters four, five and six is our practice.
[time=144] It's all about how we live.
[time=146] Four, five and six teaches us how you and I as redeemed followers of Jesus Christ are to live our lives.
[time=155] And I don't think you'd need me to sit here and tell you that you and I need help learning how to live our lives, how to live our lives in marriage, how to live our lives in the workplace, how to live our lives in the privacy of our own hearts and minds, how to live our lives with our values and our principles and our decisions.
[time=173] And so it's a fantastic study.
[time=176] Then we find ourselves today, today's message in Ephesians two, we're making our way through one, two and three and I can't wait for you to be encouraged and inspired as we look again at this great letter that Paul wrote to the church at Ephesus.
[time=191] I'm thankful that you tuned in and we'd love to see you.
[time=194] We always say it and we always say it because people keep taking us up on this.
[time=199] It would be great to see you here live and in person.
[time=202] So many of you watch week after week and truth be told you don't have a church home, we're your church home and this broadcast is something that I know many of you look forward to week after week.
[time=214] I tell you what, 2010 may be the year, maybe January is the month where you're gonna get in that car and drive here and see us at nine or 1045 on a Sunday morning and give us the privilege of shaking your hand and putting a name with a face.
[time=228] We'd love to meet you.
[time=229] Hey, thanks, thanks for tuning in this morning.
[time=232] God bless you this week.
[time=233] We hope this is an encouragement to you and we'll look forward to hopefully seeing you soon.
[time=239] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=360] (audience applauding)
[time=369] - Hey, it's good to see all of you here this morning looking forward, really am looking forward to our time.
[time=374] As you look to the screens this morning, you'll see that we make our way back to our study in the book of Ephesians, The Truth, The Way, and The Life.
[time=383] And I wanna just draw your attention real quick to the little smaller print down there at the bottom of the slide.
[time=389] Very important phrase that I know you can read quickly, but I don't want you to read it quickly.
[time=394] I want you to stop and read it slowly today because it's a very, very important phrase.
[time=399] It's very important that you and I would in our lives further study that we would be a people who would having heard the truth of God's word take time in the days that follow to further study it, to further read it, to further think about it, to further understand it so that we can further apply it
[time=423] being doers, not just hearers of the word.
[time=427] And so the digging deeper resource that you've heard me talk about before is something that I'm just gonna keep talking about with you.
[time=434] Every week it's available to you there on the web.
[time=437] By Wednesday, that Sunday's message will have been processed by our digging deeper team and they will have provided for you on the website, something you can just, you can read it there on the website, you can download it, print it off.
[time=449] It's a chance for you to kind of review the message to reflect, to do some further research and to then give yourself and the team kind of helps you do this, kind of give yourself to some application opportunities.
[time=464] My friends last week, the scriptures, I was gonna say I made it, but I didn't make the compelling case, the scriptures made a compelling case that we are to be followers of Jesus, imitators of him.
[time=477] And my friends, one of those first, I think the first one of our five elements, those traits of a Christ follower, those five elements that really are traits of our Lord himself, that first one says, personal, prayerful abiding, a follower of Christ does what Jesus did, Jesus slipped away, how many times, countless times we see Jesus in this pattern of stepping away from the busyness of life and spending time alone with the Father, listening to him,
[time=510] praying to him, personal worship.
[time=514] And it's been given that practice has been given all kinds of names over the years, I'm not so much concerned about the name we give it, I just wanna make sure you're doing it.
[time=525] That as a follower of Jesus, you're doing what he did and slipping away to be with the Father in the morning, noon or night, doesn't matter, but there needs to be, there has to be in your life in mind these times with him.
[time=541] And the digging deeper resource is a great, encouraging resource that you can take with you in those times and further study and further apply the great life-changing truth of God's word.
[time=555] So I hope you'll go to the website and begin to, as a regular part of your spiritual routine, be blessed by the work those guys are doing with the digging deeper material.
[time=570] Do you know what the single worst moment in all of human history was?
[time=578] I asked my 12-year-old daughter yesterday, just to kind of test run the questions, she got it in about two minutes.
[time=588] Do you know what the single most, do you know what the single worst moment in all of human history was?
[time=596] It was the most destructive moment.
[time=600] It was the most deadly, most debilitating, dark moment ever.
[time=605] There couldn't ever be a worse moment
[time=611] than this one moment.
[time=614] It ruined everything.
[time=619] It ruined all that was good and right.
[time=622] It left everything and everyone in its path, broken it left everything and everyone in its path scarred.
[time=632] It left everything and everyone in its path wounded.
[time=636] It was the worst moment in human history ever.
[time=642] If I were gonna ask you to turn in your Bibles
[time=649] to where that moment was recorded, where would you turn?
[time=653] Genesis, do that.
[time=656] Would you, let me hear those pages turning.
[time=658] Genesis chapter three, I don't even like turning there.
[time=662] I don't like reading it.
[time=663] I don't like thinking about it.
[time=665] I don't know about you, but I'm visual.
[time=667] And when I read, I envision and for years and years and years as I've grown more and more aware of the impact of this moment, it pains me to read it.
[time=678] But this morning in light of our purpose and where we're going, it's important that we do, worst moment of all human history.
[time=685] Genesis three, verses four to seven.
[time=689] The serpent said to the woman, there's the serpent and the woman there at the tree.
[time=692] They're there at the tree with the fruit.
[time=694] And God had told God had told the woman, God in his close, intimate relationship with Adam and Eve, he tells them, do not eat from this tree.
[time=707] Because when you eat from this tree, if you do that, if you disobey me and eat from this tree, you will what?
[time=716] Die.
[time=716] And so we pick it up in verse four.
[time=721] The serpent said to the woman, you surely will not die.
[time=725] It's what the serpent always says to the woman.
[time=732] Surely you won't.
[time=734] Surely what he says will happen won't.
[time=737] Surely there's gonna be a way for you to escape what God says will transpire.
[time=743] Surely you will not die for God, verse five, for God knows Eve, but in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened, not shut.
[time=753] And you will be like him.
[time=755] You will be like God, knowing good and evil.
[time=757] And when the woman saw, here we go, when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, isn't that how it always is?
[time=767] When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate.
[time=780] Everything in you wishes you could just
[time=787] turn that around, doesn't it?
[time=790] She ate it.
[time=793] Done.
[time=797] Over.
[time=798] And she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.
[time=805] And then the eyes of both of them were opened.
[time=810] They were opened.
[time=813] This is true.
[time=814] They were opened, and it says, and they knew with their eyes open now, they knew that they were what?
[time=820] Naked, exposed, without.
[time=827] In that moment, my friends, sin now ruled over all of mankind.
[time=834] Sin now reigned as king in us.
[time=838] No more intimacy with God, our perfect relationship with him was severed.
[time=844] No more walks with God.
[time=847] We've talked about that.
[time=848] This whole thing comes out in the open when God himself comes to the garden, and the text indicates that he made a practice of coming to the garden and walking with them in the cool of the day.
[time=856] God coming to walk with those he was intimate with, and loved him was close to.
[time=862] No more walks with God.
[time=863] Perfect relationship severed.
[time=867] God kicks him out of the garden.
[time=870] We've talked about that in essence really to save them from the tree of life, but everything's different.
[time=880] We were now dead in our sin.
[time=885] Dead, most important definition there for you to understand in this context is separated.
[time=890] We were separated from God, and you might be sitting there this morning thinking to yourself, no, wait a minute, why do you keep saying we?
[time=898] It was they.
[time=900] They did it.
[time=902] They're the ones that stood by the tree and listened to the snake and ate the fruit they sinned.
[time=907] They were separated.
[time=908] No more intimacy for them.
[time=909] No, it's us, it's you.
[time=914] Do you know that? Many of you know that.
[time=916] Others of you maybe don't know that.
[time=918] I wanna help you this morning.
[time=919] It's important for where we're going.
[time=920] It's important that you understand you were there, Romans 5.
[time=925] Did you turn there?
[time=926] Let me hear those pages flipping again.
[time=928] Romans back to the New Testament.
[time=930] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, and then you come to Romans right before 1st and 2nd Corinthians.
[time=936] Romans 5, look at verse 12.
[time=939] Why do we say we when we talk about the sin of Adam?
[time=944] Romans 5, 12.
[time=945] Therefore, you there?
[time=948] Therefore, just as through one man, sin entered into the world and death through sin.
[time=956] And so death spread to all men because all, what?
[time=962] Sin, look at verse 14.
[time=964] Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offensive Adam.
[time=973] Even over those who didn't eat the fruit, sin reigned, sin ruled over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam.
[time=984] Go on to 15.
[time=986] Romans 5, 15, but the free gift, which is what Paul's describing here to the church at Rome, but the free gift is not like the transgression.
[time=994] For if by the transgression of the one Adam, the many died, you and me, much more did the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.
[time=1006] First part of 16, the gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned.
[time=1013] For on the one hand, the judgment arose from one transgression resulting in condemnation.
[time=1022] Verse 18, Romans 5.
[time=1027] So then as through one transgression, there resulted condemnation to all men.
[time=1033] Even so through one act of righteousness, there resulted justification of life to all men.
[time=1041] For as through the one man's disobedience, the many were made sinners.
[time=1046] Did you see that?
[time=1047] For as through the one man's disobedience, the many were made sinners, even so, through the obedience of the one, the many will be made righteous.
[time=1060] Did you get it?
[time=1061] Adam sinned.
[time=1063] You came from Adam.
[time=1067] You sinned.
[time=1070] Pretty simple.
[time=1073] Pretty clear.
[time=1076] Extremely profound.
[time=1078] And very problematic.
[time=1081] In seminary, they call it seminary's where guys go to study to do this.
[time=1087] Docs go to med school, lawyers go to law school, ministry folks sometimes go to a place called seminary.
[time=1093] In seminary, they used to teach us all kinds of things.
[time=1096] I'm grateful for what they taught us.
[time=1098] There were times where in certain doctrine classes, they would talk about the seminal.
[time=1104] Some of you in the room will understand this word.
[time=1106] Others of you won't, that's okay.
[time=1108] You will later.
[time=1109] The seminal transference of sin.
[time=1117] You and I are, aren't we?
[time=1119] Literally, seminally sons and daughters of Adam.
[time=1124] So here's the deal, because we're sons and daughters
[time=1131] of Adam, because seminally it gets passed on from Adam, it did to you and to me.
[time=1137] It's a really simple phrase, but I just want you to read it and understand it, 'cause it's pretty profound.
[time=1142] We're not sinners because we sin.
[time=1147] We sin left to ourselves, we sin because we're what?
[time=1150] We sin because we're sinners.
[time=1154] You're not a sinner because you sin.
[time=1155] Do you understand this?
[time=1156] Many of you, for many of you, this is something kind of new and you need to try to wrap your arms around this.
[time=1163] We're not sinners because we sin.
[time=1166] No, you just sin because you're a sinner, 'cause you're a son or daughter of Adam.
[time=1177] The best way I can make it clear to you and it'll be really clear to you, 'cause you'll be able to identify this just like me.
[time=1183] This is kind of a hypothetical, it's kind of not.
[time=1185] There've been situations like this, but let's just pretend we're at a lake.
[time=1189] Pretend the bird family is at a lake in a boat tooling around and the lake happens to be surrounded by huge cliffs everywhere, it's really cool.
[time=1199] You're just driving around this lake, it's just mountainous and there's these huge cliffs all around the lake and just imagine in your mind's eye that the bird family pulls up to kind of the shoreline and we spot over on this one shoreline, this little tiny trail, very tiny trail, leading up to about a 60 foot, 70 foot perch that is out over the water.
[time=1220] And as you look at the trail, you realize it's a little narrow, it's very steep, that's kind of a rocky shale thing, who knows if you know like a deer could make it up there.
[time=1231] And if you're in our family, here's how this would go.
[time=1234] While you're looking at that, thinking that through, you'd all of a sudden realize that my 14 year old daughter Wesley's halfway up the trail.
[time=1242] She's put on a pair of tennis shoes and she's gonna do whatever it takes to get to that 70 foot perch 'cause she wants to jump.
[time=1250] And if you gave her time and she got up there and you said to her, "Hey, wait a minute, "have you checked how deep it is in the water?" She'd say, "I'll check it when I get down." And off she'd go.
[time=1262] She's not daring, she's the daughter of Kelly Bird.
[time=1267] Does this make sense?
[time=1272] She doesn't hop out of a boat and climb up a trail that could, you know, cost her her life and jump off a 70 foot perch 'cause she's courageous.
[time=1280] No, she's just my daughter.
[time=1282] Now in the same boat, there would be two redheads, an older boy and a younger girl who wouldn't be in the water, nor would they be up the trail, nor would they be caught dead on that perch.
[time=1292] And it's not because they're wise, it's because they're the son and daughter of Kelly Bird.
[time=1298] If you're with me, who God gave a lot of wisdom to, and they got some seminal wisdom passed down to them, I think.
[time=1306] Does that make sense?
[time=1307] It's just who they are.
[time=1311] Sinning doesn't make you a sinner.
[time=1317] You're just a sinner, so you sin.
[time=1322] It's who we are, it's, it's who we are from birth.
[time=1327] Scratch that, actually, it's who we are from before birth.
[time=1331] Do you know this?
[time=1331] Psalm 58, three, look at the screen.
[time=1334] Psalm 58, three, the wicked are estranged.
[time=1338] The wicked are estranged.
[time=1340] The wicked are separated.
[time=1341] I mean, they're already called wicked and they're estranged.
[time=1345] They're separated from God in the what?
[time=1349] In the womb, seminal transference of sin, these who speak lies go astray from birth.
[time=1357] And then those very well-known words from David in Psalm 51, Psalm 51, five, we've looked at it before.
[time=1365] Behold, I was brought forth, David says, I was brought forth in iniquity and in sin, my mother conceived me.
[time=1373] In sin, our mothers conceive us.
[time=1377] It doesn't necessarily making a statement there about how bad your mom was.
[time=1380] It's just that she's a daughter of Lou.
[time=1382] She's a daughter of Adam and sin gets passed down.
[time=1387] So we are left to ourselves, every one of us sinners.
[time=1392] It's in us, it's in our bones, it's in our blood, it's in our souls and listen, there isn't anything we can do to erase it.
[time=1403] There isn't anything we can do to escape it.
[time=1406] There isn't anything you or I can do to eradicate it.
[time=1410] We can't change it.
[time=1411] That is how it is in our humanness.
[time=1414] We are sinners and in that sin, we are lost.
[time=1419] And as if bad news could get worse, there is a reward, there is a penalty, there is an outcome.
[time=1428] There is a consequence to the fact that we are left to ourselves sinners down deep in our bones.
[time=1436] Ezekiel 18, 4.
[time=1437] Everybody in the room, read it out loud.
[time=1441] There we go.
[time=1442] The soul who sins will, the soul who sins will what?
[time=1447] Say it.
[time=1450] Death.
[time=1451] That's it.
[time=1454] That's the end of the human story.
[time=1458] That is the consequence.
[time=1461] That's where it goes.
[time=1462] The soul that sins and every soul will sin, the soul that sins will die.
[time=1471] And thank, I'm not just saying this flippantly, thank God.
[time=1477] Thank God.
[time=1479] And thank God, this is where the good news comes in.
[time=1485] Thank God, this is where we get introduced to the gospel,
[time=1491] my friends, the good news.
[time=1494] In our study of Ephesians, truth, the truth, the way,
[time=1500] the life as we make our way this morning to chapter two, this is where we find one of the most powerful, graphic, complete presentations of the gospel ever recorded.
[time=1511] It is the good news, my friends.
[time=1514] And listen, listen, it is the best news ever.
[time=1520] [AMEN] Come on, Webster tried to get you guys to do the amen thing a little bit better.
[time=1527] [AMEN] Got to work on this.
[time=1532] How you could sit still even during that last song and not stand up and shout, I don't know, but we'll keep working on it.
[time=1539] Best news ever.
[time=1542] You want to read it?
[time=1545] Let's look at it.
[time=1546] Go ahead, stand up and let me read it to you.
[time=1548] Ephesians two, in honor of God's word, just stand.
[time=1553] And let me read this to you.
[time=1555] Ephesians two verses one to nine.
[time=1556] We survived reading Genesis three.
[time=1560] Let's rejoice this morning as we read Ephesians two.
[time=1564] And you were dead and your trespasses and sins in which you formally walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the heir of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.
[time=1578] Among them, we to all of us.
[time=1582] Among them, we to all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind.
[time=1591] And we're by nature, seminal transference.
[time=1595] We were by nature, children of wrath, even as the rest.
[time=1600] But God, verse four, amen?
[time=1605] But God being rich in what?
[time=1608] But God being rich in mercy because of his great what?
[time=1613] Love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ, by grace you have been saved, and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come he might show.
[time=1636] The surpassing riches of his grace and kindness toward us in Christ Jesus, for by grace you have been saved through faith.
[time=1647] And that, the faith, not of yourself, it, the faith is a gift of God, not as a result of works so that no one may boast, not as a result of works so that no one may boast.
[time=1662] And we're gonna say verse 10 for next week.
[time=1664] You can be seated.
[time=1665] My friends, that is one of the most powerful,
[time=1671] graphic, complete presentations of the gospel ever recorded.
[time=1675] It is the good news.
[time=1677] And I want you to just write down three things this morning about, I want you to see three things about the good news.
[time=1683] I want you to track with me through this text and see that the good news is an amazing gift and our passage will show us where people are, how people live without it.
[time=1696] We'll see where people are, literally, personally, spiritually without it.
[time=1702] We'll see why God delivered it in verse four and then verses five to seven, I wanna show you what it accomplished.
[time=1709] The good news, where people are without it, why God delivered it and thirdly, what it accomplished.
[time=1716] So go back to number one.
[time=1718] So let's just ask the question.
[time=1719] And then this is an important question to ask, where are we without the gospel?
[time=1724] Where do people live without the good news?
[time=1728] What's the lie, let me ask it this way.
[time=1731] And I'll ask it this way because I think there probably are some people in the room this morning.
[time=1737] And I know there's people watching via the broadcast and you're today, and this isn't a shot at you, this isn't a slap on the wrist.
[time=1748] This really is a, you know us, this is an ongoing invitation to you to keep thinking about this and to keep opening your heart to what God has for you.
[time=1757] If you have to date, if you have not surrendered your heart and life to him, if you haven't come to that place where you've been willing to bow the knee of your heart to him, then this is how you're living.
[time=1774] Without the gospel, without the good news being embraced, the scriptures teach that this is how you're living.
[time=1783] This is the reality of your life because it says in Ephesians 2-2, it says in which you formerly walked, before you were saved, then you walked two things out of the gate.
[time=1794] You walked according to the course of this world and you walked according to the prince of the power of the heir.
[time=1805] How do we walk without embracing the gospel?
[time=1807] We walk according to the course of this world.
[time=1813] Now the word according might seem like a normal word, very important word used here in the Greek and very important that you understand it in this context.
[time=1822] The word according means, it's the word kata, K-A-T-A, kata, which in its expanded form means to be controlled or dominated by.
[time=1835] How do you live if you live without the gospel?
[time=1842] Ephesians 2-2 teaches us that you live kata, Aeon cosmos.
[time=1849] You live controlled and dominated by Aeon cosmos, A-I-O-N, K-O-S-M-O-S.
[time=1861] You live controlled by, you do.
[time=1864] And dominated by the course of this world.
[time=1871] Interesting, the course of this world.
[time=1875] Those who walk kata, Aeon cosmos are those, and this is Richard C. Trench says, these are those dominated and controlled by all the floating mass of thoughts, opinions, speculations, hopes, impulses, aspirations, and temptations that are at any time and all times current in the world, which it may be, he says, impossible to seize and accurately define, but which constitutes a most real and effective power, being the moral or immoral atmosphere, which at every moment of our lives, we inhale.
[time=1918] Again and again, only to exhale and inhale yet again.
[time=1923] We are controlled according to,
[time=1930] controlled and dominated by the course of this world.
[time=1935] The world's listen, without the gospel, without the good news, redeeming and transforming and making your heart and mind new, you are subject to, controlled by and dominated by the world's morality, the world's system of thinking, the world's philosophy, the world's entertainment.
[time=1959] First John two said, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride and pursuits of life, all of it, dominating and controlling you.
[time=1973] Kata, Aeon, cosmos.
[time=1976] We walk according to the course of this world.
[time=1979] Secondly, you can write it down there in your notes.
[time=1982] Paul says there in Ephesians 2-2, we walk according to the prince of the power of the air.
[time=1988] The word kata used again there according to, dominated and controlled by the prince of the power of the air.
[time=1998] This time Paul reminds Ephesians, here in Ephesians 2-2, he reminds the Ephesians in Scripture here, declares to each of us that people, you say what people, all people, anyone, everyone, people that are not dominated by the loving leading
[time=2019] of Christ, people who have not fully surrendered their hearts and lives to him, people who were not controlled by the spirit of God, are dominated and controlled by the prince of the power of the air.
[time=2034] Satan.
[time=2035] The devil.
[time=2038] See, I'll wait a minute, Kelly, you're,
[time=2044] I always thought you were a pretty cool guy.
[time=2046] Now you're sporting the cool goatee.
[time=2048] But I want to be like Curtis Smith, look.
[time=2053] Don't start talking about Satan and the devil and,
[time=2060] you know, you're going to get all tent revival on us, you're thinking, what's going on?
[time=2064] You're going to start whacking your hand on the thing talking about Satan.
[time=2069] Yeah.
[time=2072] And I'm not going to get all tent revival on you, but I'm just going to tell you the truth.
[time=2078] It's important, really is important that everybody understand this, that you, that you say it to yourself, that you declare it to be true because it is.
[time=2090] And it might sound harsh to some, it made to you feel overstated, but it's not.
[time=2096] There are for now, and I can't wait.
[time=2100] Thank God for the day when it won't be like this, but there are for now two rulers, two princes in this world, the Lord and Satan.
[time=2111] That's it.
[time=2115] That's all that's going on today in this world.
[time=2119] There are two domains.
[time=2122] There is the dominion of darkness, and there is the dominion of what?
[time=2126] And the Lord leads one, and Satan leads the other, and that's it.
[time=2132] Do you understand this?
[time=2133] That's all that's going on.
[time=2135] And if you, if you are not under the rule of one,
[time=2142] you are under the rule and control and influence of the other, the Lord or Satan.
[time=2155] And that's the truth.
[time=2158] The prince of the power of the heir, the tax tier helps us with this idea of the prince of the power of the heir.
[time=2167] You look, you can see it right there in verse two.
[time=2169] The heir is an interesting word.
[time=2171] I had a friend point this out to me this week.
[time=2174] In the Greek, the word used here, in Ephesians 2-2 for heir, the prince of the power of the heir is the word, it's heir.
[time=2183] Sounds like heir.
[time=2184] It's A-E-R in the Greek.
[time=2186] It's the Greek word heir, and it was used by the ancient Greeks.
[time=2190] Listen, for the lower and denser atmosphere of our everyday world, the heir we, the heir we breathe.
[time=2200] And Ather, A-I-T-H-E-R, another word for heir, not used here.
[time=2207] And Ather was used for the higher celestial space, the heir beyond our reach.
[time=2215] You with me?
[time=2217] They thought in terms of this lower heir, being the atmosphere or sphere in which we as humans live for now.
[time=2227] Satan is therefore pictured as the prince, as ruler of the demons and other agencies of evil, permeating our space, permeating our lower atmosphere, permeating our heir.
[time=2243] You say really?
[time=2245] He's the ruler of our space.
[time=2251] Luke 4.
[time=2258] Answer is yes.
[time=2260] He has been allowed that, and we see that in the confrontation between Satan and the Lord himself.
[time=2267] It says in Luke 4.5, in the midst of these temptations that Jesus encounters personally at the hand of Satan, by the time we get to verse five, and he led him up, and he let him, he, Satan, let him, Jesus, up, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
[time=2287] And the devil said to him, I will give you all this domain and its glory for it.
[time=2293] This domain, all this space, all this heir has been handed over to me.
[time=2301] And I give it to whomever I wish.
[time=2304] Therefore, if you, Jesus, worship before me, Satan, it shall be yours.
[time=2310] So yeah, it's his.
[time=2315] He is the prince of the power of the heir.
[time=2320] And for a time, for as long as God allows it to be this way, that's how it will be.
[time=2326] And in that princely role, he in watch, he influences this world.
[time=2333] And those who walk without the gospel are dominated and influenced by the course of this world, a world influenced and controlled by the prince of the power of the heir.
[time=2347] And that is your life.
[time=2350] You may think it looks better than that.
[time=2352] You may think it's brighter than that.
[time=2354] You may think it's more hopeful than that.
[time=2357] But if you haven't embraced the gospel, with the good news, the fact that Jesus Christ came and lived and died to forgive your sins and give you eternity with God.
[time=2371] If you haven't bowed the knee of your heart in humility to that, you walk according to the course of this world and the prince of the power of the heir.
[time=2381] That's just how it is.
[time=2383] I don't want you to live like that.
[time=2389] We don't want you to live in that reality.
[time=2394] And it is a reality.
[time=2395] And it's a reality that we continue, week after week, month after month, as long as you give us the chance, in this room, on this broadcast, we will invite you lovingly and hopefully to step out of that and by God's grace, come to faith in His Son and the life that He designed you to live.
[time=2414] Amen, family?
[time=2415] [AMEN] Why did He deliver it?
[time=2419] That is a picture.
[time=2421] Number one, of where people are without it.
[time=2425] This is important.
[time=2426] Why the text tells us?
[time=2427] Why did God deliver?
[time=2429] Why did God bring?
[time=2431] Why did God wrap and present such an amazing gift?
[time=2436] Why does He do this?
[time=2437] Verse four, back to Ephesians.
[time=2440] Back to Ephesians two.
[time=2443] First of all, let me just read verse three.
[time=2445] I don't want to skip three.
[time=2447] I want to just say this.
[time=2448] Course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the heir, of the spirit that is now into verse two, that is now working in the sons of disobedience, and He is working today in the sons of disobedience, isn't He?
[time=2463] How's our world doing?
[time=2466] Among them two, let me just read this.
[time=2469] Verse three, and then we'll get to why, then we'll get to why God delivered this great gift.
[time=2475] Among them two, all of these people who were walking according to the course of this world and walking according to the prince of the power of the heir.
[time=2483] Among them two, Paul says, we two all formerly lived.
[time=2487] Here Paul, look at this, Paul includes himself now.
[time=2491] Among them we two, you and me, all of us together.
[time=2495] Among them we two, all of us who know him now, but didn't used to, formerly lived.
[time=2500] And how did we live in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind?
[time=2507] And we were then, by nature, seminal transference, children of wrath, even as the rest.
[time=2514] Paul just says this, and I think it's good for you and I to read this.
[time=2517] This is true.
[time=2518] Here's what I want to do right here right now.
[time=2519] That's true about you and me, isn't it?
[time=2526] We were that.
[time=2530] We did all that.
[time=2532] We thought all that.
[time=2533] We were guided and controlled and dominated by all of that, weren't we?
[time=2537] Say something.
[time=2537] Yeah.
[time=2539] Not overstating it.
[time=2542] Am I?
[time=2543] Or is he?
[time=2545] That was us.
[time=2547] That's how we lived because we lived and walked according to the course of this world, according to Satan.
[time=2555] And now we come to verse four.
[time=2559] Why in the world would he do what he did?
[time=2563] But God, that was all true, but God being rich in mercy.
[time=2571] Because of his great love with which he loved us.
[time=2576] Why did he deliver it?
[time=2578] My friends, this is so important that you understand this.
[time=2580] And I know there are a lot of you in the room who do to a large degree.
[time=2584] There are others who don't, but whether you understand it clearly or this is all new news to you.
[time=2589] This is good for us to just put our arms around this again.
[time=2594] Why did God deliver the good news?
[time=2596] Why did God send his son?
[time=2598] Why did God rescue and redeem us from all of that?
[time=2602] Two things before I give you the answer, the text gives you the answer, but I want you to write these things down.
[time=2608] First of all, please, please understand this.
[time=2610] It's not because, and many of you need to make this distinction, it's not because you earned it.
[time=2616] There are hundreds of thousands, there are millions of people in the world today
[time=2624] who have been influenced and are being influenced by any number of religions.
[time=2631] And we've talked about this.
[time=2634] This is, we're not about religion here.
[time=2637] This is not a religious gathering.
[time=2639] We're not a religious people.
[time=2641] By very definition, religion talks about and religion teaches people how they can get to God.
[time=2650] And you can put a number of different names on the church sign out in front.
[time=2656] We're not going to get into bashing different religion.
[time=2658] I'm just telling you, there are those who have grown up, many of you in this room, you've grown up for years being taught that you had to be good enough to get to heaven, that you had to earn your way to salvation, that only the good, only the right, only the moral get redeemed.
[time=2680] It's not because you earned it, you didn't earn it.
[time=2682] In fact, if seminal transference is true, not only did you eat the apple, but you drove the nails in his hand and you killed him.
[time=2689] I'll never forget the first time I saw the passion of the Christ.
[time=2695] Many of you were with me that day in that theater across town, and we sat there and watched that thing for three hours or whatever it was.
[time=2702] And I told you then, and I'll say it to you again, every time I watched that film, the dominant thought during the crucifixion is,
[time=2710] well, the first dominant thought is, I wish they would stop.
[time=2713] The second dominant thought is, I did that.
[time=2718] I did that.
[time=2721] He didn't deliver the gospel because you earned it.
[time=2727] You didn't earn anything.
[time=2732] Religion teaches you that you must earn it through ceremony and ritualistic routine and dotting all your spiritual eyes and crossing all your spiritual teas.
[time=2741] You can't.
[time=2742] It's impossible.
[time=2745] The chasm is too big to jump.
[time=2748] He didn't deliver it because you earned it.
[time=2752] And please, please write this down.
[time=2754] He didn't deliver it because you were a good deal.
[time=2760] He didn't deliver it, my friends, because you were so attractive and useful to him.
[time=2768] We think this at times.
[time=2771] We were laughing about it first hour.
[time=2773] It's true.
[time=2773] We get going along in this life of ours.
[time=2775] And after a while, we start thinking, hey, you know, and I think I figured out why he wanted me so badly.
[time=2779] Look at what I'm doing.
[time=2782] Look at who I'm reaching.
[time=2785] Look at what I'm accomplishing.
[time=2787] Look at the good that I do.
[time=2789] Now I know why you should've just said it from the beginning.
[time=2792] No.
[time=2794] He looked at you and saw...
[time=2798] Go to Romans.
[time=2801] Come on, flip those pages.
[time=2803] Go to Romans 5.
[time=2804] Real quick.
[time=2804] Go to Romans 5.
[time=2807] Romans 5, I don't know that this will be on the screen 6 to 10.
[time=2817] Let's just be clear on this, okay?
[time=2818] Before we just say it and it's not that complicated.
[time=2822] It's profound and amazing why he did it.
[time=2824] And before we get there, let's just be clear on this.
[time=2827] It's not because you earned it and it's not because you were so attractive to him.
[time=2830] Because when he looked at you in your unforgiven, unredeemed, lost, seminally transferred, sinful state, understand this is what he saw.
[time=2840] For while we were still helpless, underline that.
[time=2845] For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the what?
[time=2849] Ungodly, underline that.
[time=2852] For one will hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die.
[time=2858] But God demonstrates his own love toward us, and that while we were yet sinners, underline that.
[time=2865] Christ died for us much more than having now been justified
[time=2871] by his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through him.
[time=2876] For if while we were what? Say it, enemies, underline that.
[time=2882] For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his son, much more having been reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
[time=2894] He looked at you, and he didn't see someone attractive and useful or bright or sharp.
[time=2901] He looked at you and saw someone who was helpless, ungodly, sinning, and an enemy.
[time=2907] Because that's where you and I are left when we walk according to the course of this world,
[time=2915] according to the prince of the power and the heir, left to ourselves in our sinfulness and our depravity. That's what he saw. So it's not because you earned it and it's not because
[time=2926] you were a good deal. It's because, it's because he loved you. He just, he just loved you. You killed his son,
[time=2946] you walked according to the course and the domination of Satan, you and I were children of wrath.
[time=2955] We were enemies of God and he loved, he loved us and he loved us so much.
[time=2964] Look what he did. Look what it accomplished.
[time=2969] Verses 5 and 7, go back to Ephesians, he loved you so much he gave his son.
[time=2975] He loved you so much that he brought the gospel. He loved you so much that the good news gets played out. And when we were dead, verse 5, this is what it accomplished. Third point, what it accomplished.
[time=2986] When we were dead in our transgressions, what do dead people need? Dead people need to be made
[time=2993] what alive? He made us alive. He made us alive together with Christ. Amen, church?
[time=3003] And raised us up. Don't stop there. And raised us up with him and seated us with him in the
[time=3009] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. He brought you back to life. When? It's a great question.
[time=3018] When did he bring you back to life? Did he bring you back to life the day you walked in aisle and
[time=3026] knelt or prayed with a pastor? Did he bring you back to life that morning you prayed with your mom in your room to accept Jesus into your heart? When did he actually bring you back to life? He
[time=3037] brought you back to life really, literally when he brought Jesus back to life. Amen?
[time=3047] And the text just goes right on. Look at this. Look at verse 6. It says, "Even when we were dead
[time=3054] in our transgressions," verse 6, "He raised us up with him. He made us alive together with Christ
[time=3061] by grace you have been saved." And verse 6, "And raised us up with him." In Christ being raised,
[time=3071] some of you know this, some of you don't. In Christ being raised from the dead, it's why,
[time=3077] listen, it's why the resurrection is such a big deal. Yes, the resurrection is a big deal because he got raised. I understand that. But my friends, the big deal about Easter, the big deal
[time=3088] about resurrection Sunday, isn't that we're just observing it? The big deal about it is while we're
[time=3094] observing it, we got to participate in it. We got raised, raised from the dead with Christ.
[time=3109] And he seated us. I'm going to ask the band to come on up. We're going to respond to this great
[time=3115] truth and worship this morning. But let me just say this to you. He raised this up, verse 6,
[time=3121] and seated us with him in heaven. That's what the, don't look at them, look at me. That's
[time=3129] like I feel like a kindergarten teacher. Right here. Did you know?
[time=3139] This is not heresy. You might leave going while he is. Did you hear what Kelly said? Did you know
[time=3147] that you're in heaven? You're already there, positionally, spiritually. You can see it right
[time=3158] there in the text. He raised you up and he seated you with him, Christ, in the heavenly places.
[time=3167] And Colossians 3 says, "If you've been raised up with Christ, then keep your mind on the things
[time=3174] where above." Why? I'll just leave you with this. If that's true, and is it true? Amen? If it's true,
[time=3188] why would we live? Why would you live like this is where you are? Why would you live attached to
[time=3196] this? Why would you live in love with this place? Why would you live so drawn to and so enamored with
[time=3206] this when the fact is, you don't walk according to this anymore. You walk according to him and
[time=3214] you've been raised up with him and you've been seated with him and he gives us this unbelievable unspeakable privilege of living here, yes, here. We're here for a while, but we live with new lenses
[time=3227] and new eyes and new hearts. And I can't wait for next week because there's something,
[time=3233] there's something that he before the foundations of the world prepared for us to do as we live
[time=3239] according to him and not Satan. And I can't wait to tell you about that one thing that he prepared
[time=3245] for us to do. Let's stand. Please don't leave. Just stand and sing and respond and let's worship
[time=3252] our God, Jonathan, lead us if you would. Thank you.
