[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] My name's Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Black Hawk Ministries, and we're really thankful that you've joined us today.
[time=42] Many of you, I'm sure almost all of you, are extremely aware of the heartbreaking and tragic events that have taken place in recent days in Haiti.
[time=53] The earthquake that rocked that small little country has wreaked havoc in that land and killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[time=62] And there are, as you and I know, as we watch the news reports, hundreds of thousands of others who are hurting and hungry and without supplies and wondering where their loved ones are, it's an amazing scene down there.
[time=77] And it stirs, I know, many of our hearts and many of us want to do nothing more than help in whatever ways possible, in whatever ways we can.
[time=86] I want to just tell you how thankful we are at Black Hawk for the relationship that we've initiated and been enjoying over the last couple of months with an organization called Real Religion.
[time=98] Real Religion, you can find out more about Real Religion at their website, realreligion.org, but you may remember over the month of December, we've been partnering with them prior to the earthquake in Haiti to help supply medical enzymes, cleaning enzymes for surgical instruments, one out of four surgeries in third world countries, in poverty-ridden countries, one out of four surgeries end in death, and not because of the sickness or the illness that was trying to be addressed, but because of post-operative infection.
[time=133] And we were, while saddened by the news of what took place in Haiti, we were thrilled this week to learn that of the enzyme barrels that Black Hawk threw are above and beyond end of the year giving, we were able to purchase a number of barrels of enzymes, two or three of those, I think, are on their way to Haiti today.
[time=154] There are only four surgical clinics open in all of Haiti, and our enzymes are on their way there to help those doctors and those surgeons as they try to care for the physical needs of the people there.
[time=166] I say all this just to let you know that if you have something in your heart where you're wanting to do something for Haiti, you're wanting to help people who are in need, you can go to realreligion.org, and you can look into purchasing maybe your own barrel of enzymes and have those enzymes sent to Haiti.
[time=184] I think one barrel of enzymes covers 28,000 surgeries.
[time=188] It's an amazing gift that we can give and not just to Haiti, but all over the world.
[time=194] I'm thankful for the real religion team.
[time=197] They are an amazing group of people with a heart and a vision to truly help meet the physical needs of those all over the world.
[time=204] So go to realreligion.org, see what you can learn there about this great opportunity to help the least of these.
[time=211] And I know they'll be grateful.
[time=213] God bless you, thank you for tuning in.
[time=216] And as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=603] - Well, hey, if you take your Bibles
[time=621] and open to Ephesians, last week we came back to our study in this great epistle, Paul's letter to the church at Ephesus, we came back to our study that we've entitled the truth, the way and the life.
[time=633] And again, just a reminder to you on that, you may be joining us for the first time or you may be new to this study, the truth, the way, the life, we've entitled this because as some of you in the room know, the first three chapters of Ephesians deal with the truth about salvation.
[time=650] In these first three chapters we're learning the reality of what God has accomplished, the reality of what God has done, the reality of what God has provided in redeeming us, first three chapters all about the great truth of salvation.
[time=666] Next three chapters, four, five and six, and we'll get there, we'll get there, four, five and six.
[time=671] Teach us and help us understand the way in which we are to live that salvation out in the practical everyday of our lives, the truth of our salvation, the way that salvation gets lived out, all of that when married leading to, and I don't want you to miss this, leading to the life, real living, the best life,
[time=697] the most meaningful life, the fullest life you could ever imagine.
[time=704] When the truth about what God has done is married to the way in which He's called us to live, we get to live a life worth living.
[time=712] Last week we came to chapter two, and we entitled our message last week, the best news ever, you may have gotten some good news lately, and that's a good thing, it's great when good news comes our way spiritually, and eternally speaking, we saw last week the best news ever, and we saw that best news ever in light of the worst thing that had ever happened, the fall of mankind, the introduction of sin into our lives and this world, and it was a huge encouragement to me, obviously to many of you, the response over the week was phenomenal, I'm so thankful for the kind and encouraging notes you send, for the emails, for the texts, let me read to you, can I, would you stand in honor of God's word, let's look at that best news ever, the best news ever my friends was the gospel, and here we found in verses one to seven, maybe the most, the clearest, most powerful graphic, descriptive presentation of the gospel in all of scripture, and you were, it says in two one, you were dead, that's what sin had done, you were dead and your trespasses and sins in which you formerly walked, according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience, among them we too all formerly lived,
[time=798] in the lusts of our flesh indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and we were by nature the seminal transference of sin because we are sons and daughters of Adam, the scripture taught us last week that we are by nature, it's just who we are, children of wrath, even as the rest, but God.
[time=820] Thank God for Ephesians two four, amen, but God being rich in mercy, that being the reality because of his great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us a what?
[time=838] Alive, made us alive together with Christ and verse six raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that, so that in the ages to come,
[time=854] he might show, he might put on display the surpassing riches of his grace and kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
[time=865] Father God, these are powerful words of truth and as we revisit them this morning and move on in this passage, we pray, God, that your word and your spirit and that you, God, would remind us of truth forgotten, God introduce us to new truth that can change our hearts and minds, God, that we would be solidified and fortified and built up and ready in our hearts and spirits, Lord, to face all that you'll bring across our paths and the days to come because of our time together here with you this morning.
[time=902] God, we gather to encounter you.
[time=905] We pray, God, that as we encounter you in this text this morning, that you would do a miraculous thing in our hearts and lives.
[time=915] We pray that, God, we believe you can and will do that and all the people in the room agreed and said, "Amen, you can be seated." Well, the best news ever, the gospel, we saw last week where we are without the gospel.
[time=929] And again, this is just by way of review.
[time=931] You can take some notes if you weren't here last week or look on your note sheet from the previous week.
[time=935] Where are we without the gospel?
[time=938] Ephesians two, one to three told us, we are dead.
[time=941] We're absolutely flatlined, we're gone, we're done.
[time=945] We're lifeless, we're corpses.
[time=948] Without the gospel, we are dead.
[time=950] The passage there, verses one to three, it taught us that without the gospel, we walk according to, you remember that word I taught you, kata, K-A-T-A.
[time=959] We walk according to the course of this world.
[time=962] We walk according to the prince of the power of the air.
[time=966] The word kata means to be controlled by, to be dominated by, we are without the gospel, controlled by, literally dominated by Satan, dominated by the course and the philosophy and the thinking of this world, this world, not his world.
[time=985] This is the reality, this is where we are without the gospel.
[time=991] We looked at why God delivered the gospel, why is it, what motivates a gracious loving God to rescue dead, sinful, depraved people?
[time=1003] We were really clear, it wasn't your good looks, it wasn't my usefulness, it wasn't anything that we had merited, it's nothing that we had earned, it was simply and only the absolute ever lasting love of God, but God being rich in mercy because of the love with which he loved us made us alive.
[time=1028] We were dead and controlled by the course of this world
[time=1034] and Satan without the gospel.
[time=1036] God delivered the gospel because he loved us and only because he loved us.
[time=1042] What did the gospel accomplish?
[time=1043] We got here toward the end of our time last week.
[time=1045] What did the gospel accomplish versus five to seven?
[time=1048] It revived us, it's the one thing dead people need.
[time=1052] We talked about that, divine CPR.
[time=1056] All of a sudden what was dead and gone is alive and active, the gospel revives us.
[time=1062] It raised us up and seated us for six.
[time=1065] It raised us and seated us with Christ in heaven.
[time=1068] You see that there in verse six, that's really true.
[time=1071] We ended with this last week, my friends, that's really, really true.
[time=1076] It's who you are.
[time=1078] You have been saved.
[time=1080] You are in Christ.
[time=1081] You are not alone.
[time=1083] You are in Christ and when you fully surrendered your heart and life to him, that moment he redeemed you, you went to be with him in the heavenlies.
[time=1094] You are in Christ.
[time=1095] You are seated with Christ in heaven.
[time=1098] That is positionally and really Webster.
[time=1102] Steve Webster talks about a couple of two, three weeks and we talk to us about the real world and the real world, your real world.
[time=1111] The reality of where you really are is you are with him, sealed in him.
[time=1117] What a great truth.
[time=1121] It revived us.
[time=1122] It raised us up and seated us with him.
[time=1125] And this is new for you here this morning.
[time=1128] Here we jump in at verse seven, it revealed.
[time=1132] Would you write that down?
[time=1133] It revived us, it raised us up.
[time=1135] It revealed salvation, my friends.
[time=1137] The gospel revealed, it put on display God's grace
[time=1143] so that in the ages to come, he might show the surpassing riches of his grace and kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
[time=1156] Now I really, really don't want you to miss this because I know you like me.
[time=1161] We have a lot of thoughts and we've got a lot of things that we believe we understand to be true about redemption and salvation.
[time=1168] And I understand where your mind goes.
[time=1170] I know where my mind goes.
[time=1173] And I want to make sure that we say this as clearly as we can.
[time=1176] Salvation, my friends, contrary to what many of us think at times and contrary to what many say, salvation isn't primarily about us.
[time=1191] Do you understand this?
[time=1192] Salvation is not primarily about us.
[time=1198] We're not the big deal in salvation.
[time=1202] God is.
[time=1204] God is the big deal in salvation.
[time=1209] God's saving work is the miracle.
[time=1212] The great glory of redemption isn't look what God did for me.
[time=1219] Although all of us understand the sentiment there, we're all grateful for what God did for us, amen?
[time=1226] But the great glory of redemption, the great story here isn't look what God did for me.
[time=1232] The great story of redemption is look what God did, period.
[time=1237] Yeah, and you can clap your hands and you can say amen.
[time=1241] Look what God did.
[time=1244] Really the great glory of redemption is look at God, period.
[time=1249] Enough said.
[time=1250] Somebody once said he didn't have to.
[time=1254] You know what's true, don't you?
[time=1257] He didn't have to.
[time=1258] He shouldn't have.
[time=1262] He had no reason to.
[time=1264] And that he did simply and only shows the unimaginable depth and breadth of his goodness, his kindness and his grace.
[time=1271] The reality of salvation should leave us on our faces, crying out how great and glorious is the God of our salvation.
[time=1280] Great is his name and great are his merciful deeds which saved us.
[time=1286] That's the great story of redemption, God saves, period.
[time=1291] Now how did we receive the gospel?
[time=1298] Again, just moving on from where we were last week.
[time=1300] How did we receive the gospel?
[time=1302] And I know, again, I understand myself, like many of you, there came that point in time when you bow the knee of your heart, you prayed a prayer, you thought some really clear thoughts and you surrendered everything to him and you might have been six, you may have been 16, you might have been 60 and we've talked about how God, even though he chooses us and redeems us, he lets us participate in that moment where we fall on our faces literally or figuratively and we give ourselves completely and totally to him.
[time=1337] How in the midst of that though, I want you to think about this.
[time=1341] How did we receive the gospel?
[time=1344] Ephesians two, eight and nine.
[time=1349] Many of you know it for others of you, it may be new truth.
[time=1352] I'll tell you what, it is great, great truth.
[time=1355] How'd you receive it?
[time=1357] Four by grace.
[time=1361] Say it with me.
[time=1363] Four by grace.
[time=1368] Anything else?
[time=1370] Four by grace.
[time=1373] How did you, how did I receive?
[time=1377] How did I get to experience and benefit from the effects of the gospel?
[time=1383] Four by grace.
[time=1388] You have been saved.
[time=1391] Through faith, the text says that for by grace we have been saved and that this has been accomplished through faith.
[time=1399] And we've talked about this before, but just be really clear about it.
[time=1402] Was this a faith that you mustered up?
[time=1404] Is this a faith that you brought to the equation?
[time=1406] We're closing on our refinance this week and the guy called me the other day said, hey, make sure you bring and he rattle off like six things.
[time=1412] And I wanna bring all those six things 'cause I want this transaction to go through, right?
[time=1416] Because there's some things I gotta bring to the table for it to work.
[time=1420] So what did you bring to the table for this redemption transaction to work?
[time=1426] Go ahead, answer.
[time=1429] Nothing.
[time=1431] The faith that energizes this transaction, even that was a gift.
[time=1437] By grace alone, God's through faith alone from God, so no one can boast.
[time=1445] Four by grace, you have been saved.
[time=1449] Through faith and that, that faith, not of yourself, yet the faith is a gift of God.
[time=1454] This salvation, this redemption, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.
[time=1463] Let me just say this to you.
[time=1465] I felt compelled to say it to him first hour and I feel compelled to say it to you again.
[time=1469] Second hour here, many of you in the room don't necessarily need me to say this to you, to teach you something new, but I wanna remind those of you who already know this, but I wanna say this to those who might be, just coming to grips with this.
[time=1484] There is no work you can do to save yourself.
[time=1490] There is no church building you can walk into,
[time=1497] there is no tradition you can be a part of, there is no ritual that you can give yourself to, there isn't anything you can do.
[time=1506] There is nothing you can do.
[time=1508] There is absolutely nothing.
[time=1511] You can engage in, there is nothing you can be disciplined in, there is no habit you can form that can ever come close to saving you.
[time=1520] It is not by works, is what the text says,
[time=1527] but it is by grace.
[time=1530] By the great, listen, by the gracious gift of God alone.
[time=1537] If God doesn't graciously gift us with salvation, we don't get saved.
[time=1544] I've read this story probably 100 times over the years,
[time=1550] it shows up in all kinds of different forms and all the different books that guys like me read when they think about messages like this.
[time=1557] I just decided this week to read it to you.
[time=1562] It's a powerful story.
[time=1563] It's a great, great illustration of this truth.
[time=1567] It's important for you to know this.
[time=1569] Suppose a drunk driver kills a child.
[time=1574] That individual is arrested, tried, found guilty,
[time=1582] sentenced to a term of imprisonment and a fine.
[time=1585] After this individual who while drunk has killed this child after he has paid the fine and served the imprisonment as far as the law, as far as the rules, as far as the law is concerned, the matter is over, right?
[time=1605] Correct, as far as the law is concerned,
[time=1612] as far as the rules go, the penalty has been paid, the imprisonment has been completed, the fines come in, the matter is over.
[time=1623] But not so much with the father of the child killed.
[time=1628] He can never put things right with that father
[time=1634] by serving a term of imprisonment or paying a fine.
[time=1637] The only thing which can restore his relationship to that father is an act of free forgiveness on the part of who, that father.
[time=1651] That is how it is between us and God.
[time=1654] Realize this, it's not God's rules that have been violated.
[time=1661] It's not God's law that got broken, you send against God.
[time=1666] You send against God's heart and therefore only an act of free forgiveness by the grace of a good God can put us back into a right and meaningful relationship with him.
[time=1681] My buddy Jason gave this to me.
[time=1683] Just this morning, Dallas Willard said that grace is opposed, I love this.
[time=1688] Grace is opposed to earning, not to what?
[time=1693] Effort.
[time=1696] Grace is opposed to earning, not to effort.
[time=1702] By the grace of God, we have been saved,
[time=1708] all of which should lead us to, I hope you'll write this down this morning, the gospel lived out.
[time=1714] You say, what does this look like?
[time=1716] What does the gospel lived out look like?
[time=1718] Well, the whole passage leads to chapter two, verse 10.
[time=1723] Everything we've read from one to nine leads us to verse 10.
[time=1727] Here we have the gospel lived out.
[time=1729] What does it look like?
[time=1730] It looks like this.
[time=1731] We are his, it says in verse 10.
[time=1732] For we are his workmanship.
[time=1735] What a great word.
[time=1736] Works of art, divinely crafted.
[time=1739] Works of art created in Christ Jesus for good works.
[time=1744] The scriptures teach us this morning
[time=1750] that the reason he saved us was so that we could do these good works where a workmanship created in Christ to do good deeds, good deeds, which God, end of the verse, prepared beforehand before the foundations of the world so that we would walk, important word, so that we would walk in them.
[time=1773] My friends, whenever you see the word walk in the epistles, you can always bank on the fact that what it's referring to is everyday activity.
[time=1784] These good deeds that you got redeemed to take part in,
[time=1793] are good works according to the scriptures that we are to walk in everyday activity.
[time=1801] Your daily life should be characterized, the scripture says, by these good deeds, prepared before the foundation of the world.
[time=1812] What a contrast.
[time=1814] Verse one and verse 10, look at that.
[time=1817] In verse one, you were dead in your trust passes and sin.
[time=1823] Now you're not dead anymore.
[time=1824] Now you're a work of art.
[time=1826] Now you're a new creation.
[time=1830] A new, alive, redeemed, hopeful, forgiven, blessed, gifted piece of divine work.
[time=1837] You're a piece of divine work.
[time=1841] You are a piece of divinely crafted art.
[time=1849] Uniquely crafted in Christ so that you would carry out pre-ordained good deeds.
[time=1856] Listen, when you embrace and experience the heart changing life, transforming power of the gospel.
[time=1863] Have you done that?
[time=1864] Many of you in the room this morning have, some of you haven't yet.
[time=1871] But watch what happens.
[time=1872] When you do, when you embrace and experience the heart changing life transforming power of the gospel, you do good works.
[time=1885] It's just how it works.
[time=1888] It's just what comes out of one who has been redeemed.
[time=1893] The good works don't save you because what did I just tell you?
[time=1897] I just told you there's nothing you can do to get saved.
[time=1901] The good works don't save you, right?
[time=1907] I had the conversation this week with somebody.
[time=1908] I had to remind them that there's good people.
[time=1911] There's good people who did benevolent things in their life who are in hell today.
[time=1917] Because being a good person who does benevolent things doesn't get you saved.
[time=1924] And it certainly doesn't get you to heaven.
[time=1926] Those who go to heaven are saved people, not good benevolent people.
[time=1931] Is this making sense somebody nod your head?
[time=1933] All right, good.
[time=1937] Good deeds simply prove that you really are saved.
[time=1941] They validate, they give testimony to Christ's redeeming work.
[time=1946] So what's a good work?
[time=1947] I hope you'll write this down.
[time=1948] I really do.
[time=1949] This is so important for us this morning.
[time=1951] What's a good work?
[time=1952] What is a good deed?
[time=1954] Any activity or service, I wrote it down for you.
[time=1958] Any activity or service, everybody should know this.
[time=1961] Any activity or service offered from our heart filled with an attitude of love.
[time=1967] It's not a heart filled with benevolence.
[time=1970] It's not a heart filled with social justice.
[time=1972] This is a heart filled with an attitude of godly love.
[time=1977] Any kind or loving deed, here it is, that embodies or represents the heart and character of God.
[time=1987] And we've been teaching you and we've been proclaiming to you for the last couple years that we long for you in this family to be priests, priests that go, priests that pass along the heart of God, priests that in the way you live, you pass along the attributes of God.
[time=2008] These are good works.
[time=2010] These are good deeds that embody and represent the heart and character of God.
[time=2022] How would you describe question for you?
[time=2025] How would you describe the heart and character of God?
[time=2028] Oh my, that's a six week series.
[time=2034] But I'll tell you what, kind, loving, thoughtful,
[time=2040] merciful, sacrificial, gracious, sympathetic,
[time=2048] tender, come to mind.
[time=2051] Question number two for you.
[time=2055] Who do we know from history that best embodied the heart and character of God?
[time=2060] God, who do we know from history that most clearly embodied the heart of God in the deeds or works that this person did?
[time=2068] Who is it?
[time=2069] Jesus, Jesus, did you get that?
[time=2072] Nobody on earth has ever embodied in the deeds that he did, more clearly or powerfully, the heart of God than Jesus.
[time=2082] Who interacted with and served needy people in a kind, loving, thoughtful, sacrificial, gracious, sympathetic, tender way.
[time=2092] I got a note from a buddy this week.
[time=2096] I was gonna kind of redo it and kind of fit it in my own way and I just kept reading.
[time=2101] I thought, you know, I'm just gonna read what he wrote.
[time=2103] It's really good.
[time=2104] He says, as we're talking about this back and forth on a couple of emails, he says, it's inconceivable.
[time=2109] It's absolutely inconceivable to consider oneself
[time=2115] a disciple of Jesus, an imitator of the Lord, someone modeling their life after his if there are only a few or periodic good deeds.
[time=2130] He says, he goes on to say here to me, deeds matter, works matter, not to save you but to give evidence of.
[time=2142] They were the final, he reminds me here, they were the final answer.
[time=2147] According to Jesus in Matthew 25, good deeds to the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick, the imprisoned, the earthquake victim, they were good deeds.
[time=2163] They were the answer, he reminds me.
[time=2166] People who hadn't done them went to hell.
[time=2169] Go ahead, turn there, you're gonna wait, really?
[time=2174] It says that, yeah, it says that.
[time=2176] Go to Matthew 25.
[time=2177] Let me hear those pages turning black out, come on.
[time=2181] Come on, turn them.
[time=2184] Matthew 25, 34, I want you to read this with your own eyes, I want you to see it right there in your own Bible, then the king, Matthew 25, 34.
[time=2194] It says, then the king will say to those on his right, come, you who are blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world, we're talking about heaven here, we're talking about eternity, we're talking about being in, and he says, come on, you, all of you, you're in.
[time=2218] For I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat,
[time=2224] I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink.
[time=2227] I was a stranger, and you invited me in, I was naked, and you clothed me, I was sick, and you visited me, I was in prison, and you came to me.
[time=2239] And then the righteous will answer him.
[time=2241] The righteous, can you see him?
[time=2242] The righteous, they're going, hey, listen, we're really glad we're here.
[time=2245] This is all like, whew, this is good.
[time=2248] We're happy to be here, but what in the world are you talking about?
[time=2252] Like, can you just tell us?
[time=2255] 'Cause we never did any of that to you.
[time=2257] And he says, yeah, you did.
[time=2261] Yeah, you did.
[time=2265] He says this,
[time=2272] when did we see you a stranger?
[time=2273] When did we, 37, the righteous, full answer him, Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you, or thirsty, and give you something to drink?
[time=2283] When did we see you a stranger, invite you in, or naked, and clothe you?
[time=2286] When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you, and the king will answer them, and say to them, truly, I say to you, truly.
[time=2292] To the extent that you did it, to one of these brothers of mine, even the what, say it out loud, the least of them, you did it to who, me.
[time=2307] And for time's sake, I'm gonna just tell you
[time=2313] that next part of that passage, you can read it, but then there's another whole group that he looks at, and says, hey, you know what, you're out.
[time=2318] You're not coming in.
[time=2321] And they're like, what are you talking about?
[time=2323] We did all kinds of things.
[time=2326] And he says, you know what, you didn't feed me, you didn't clothe me, you didn't heal me when I was sick, you didn't come to me when, he goes through that whole thing again, and they say to him, what are you talking about?
[time=2337] We never did, you know, we never saw you like that.
[time=2339] What are you saying?
[time=2340] And he says, you know what, to the extent that you didn't do it to the least of these.
[time=2344] If you didn't do it to them, you didn't do it to me.
[time=2348] And if you didn't do it to them, then something's not right in here.
[time=2351] You're not of me, you're out.
[time=2353] Wow.
[time=2362] In an effort to escape, A.W. Tozer said this.
[time=2366] In an effort to escape the error of salvation by works, we have fallen into the opposite error of salvation without obedience.
[time=2377] I'll read that to you one more time.
[time=2379] In an effort to escape the error of salvation by works, we have fallen into the opposite error of salvation without obedience.
[time=2392] We're supposed to feed them if we're his.
[time=2397] Do you understand?
[time=2398] We're supposed to give him water.
[time=2402] Somebody said to me after first hour, yeah, but they take advantage of it.
[time=2407] Said, yeah, you're right, they do.
[time=2410] Sometimes that's how that goes.
[time=2412] But I didn't think we were talking about them.
[time=2414] I thought we were talking about you.
[time=2418] And he said, oops, have a good day, pastor.
[time=2422] I'm supposed to, you're supposed to.
[time=2430] We are his workmanship.
[time=2433] We're these works of art that God created to do these things.
[time=2438] And we don't do them.
[time=2440] Matthew five, six says, do your good deeds before men so that men can make much of you?
[time=2446] No, so that when they see your good deeds, they'll make much of who?
[time=2449] God, it's what the children of God do.
[time=2453] It's what we were redeemed for.
[time=2456] And I want you to watch this this morning.
[time=2457] We did this a couple months ago, but we brought it back today.
[time=2461] I want you to watch this closely.
[time=2462] Listen, we're his workmanship created in Christ to do good works.
[time=2469] And it's so very, very important that you understand that that, my friends, entails you and I being willing to have God day in and day out prepare us for that.
[time=2481] There are things God needs to do in me.
[time=2483] Believe me.
[time=2484] There are things that God needs to do in you.
[time=2487] And as his workmanship, I hope you'll watch this and listen, I hope that you'll be willing to follow suit.
[time=2494] What a great picture you're about to see.
[time=2496] I'll come back up in just a moment, but watch and be encouraged.
[time=2499] (gentle music)
[time=2507] Ephesians 2-10 says we are God's workmanship.
[time=2511] In essence, his masterpiece.
[time=2513] Now I don't know about you, but when I get up in the morning and I look in the mirror, I don't see a masterpiece.
[time=2519] Maybe a Picasso, but I want to be a masterpiece.
[time=2523] I want to be everything God has created me to be.
[time=2526] And so I go to him and I say, God, do whatever it takes to get the things out of my life that don't need to be there.
[time=2534] Mold me into the image of your son so that I can be your masterpiece.
[time=2540] - Hi, well who are you?
[time=2542] - I'm God.
[time=2543] - No you're not.
[time=2543] - Yes I am, you said the prayer, so here I am.
[time=2545] That's how it works.
[time=2547] - Okay, well if you're God, then why don't you make it snow in here?
[time=2552] - You know if I made it snow in here, get kind of yucky, so I really don't want to do that.
[time=2555] - See, you're not God.
[time=2557] - Why would you say that?
[time=2558] - You said yucky.
[time=2559] God doesn't say yucky.
[time=2561] - Yes I do, it's a Greek word.
[time=2564] - Okay, well if you're God, then what does Lamentations 15-9 say?
[time=2571] - You know Lamentations is a really short book and only has five chapters.
[time=2575] - Why so short?
[time=2576] - It's tired of lamenting.
[time=2578] - Well if you're God, then who's going to win the Super Bowl this year?
[time=2583] - You know I'm not so much into playing games.
[time=2584] Why are you so much into playing games?
[time=2586] - You are God.
[time=2588] - What gave it away?
[time=2589] - You answered my question with a question.
[time=2591] - I did.
[time=2593] - Can I do that, don't I?
[time=2595] You see I did it there again.
[time=2596] Okay, let's go ahead here.
[time=2598] - Okay, wait, what's this?
[time=2602] - Well these are the tools I'm going to use to turn you into my original masterpiece.
[time=2605] - Oh, okay.
[time=2606] - Yeah, I thought you were a carpenter.
[time=2608] - That's my son.
[time=2610] - Right.
[time=2610] - Well wait, how do you know what to chisel and what to leave?
[time=2615] - Well I'm going to get rid of all the things in your life that aren't of me, kind of like dead weight.
[time=2619] - Oh well if that's the case, could you focus in this area right here?
[time=2622] - I've been trying to get it to go away for a long time.
[time=2624] You know, I've tried everything.
[time=2625] I've tried watching what I eat, I've tried exercise.
[time=2628] I even tried Pilates for a while, that was awkward.
[time=2631] But you know, I can't see me to get rid of us.
[time=2632] You could just chisel right here.
[time=2634] - Are you going to talk or can I chisel?
[time=2636] - Talk, chisel, talk, chisel, talk.
[time=2639] - Chisel.
[time=2640] - Okay.
[time=2641] Here we go.
[time=2643] You've got some anger and some pride.
[time=2652] And see, you compare yourself to others instead of me.
[time=2655] You're lazy.
[time=2659] But you pretend like you're really, really busy.
[time=2663] You've got a problem with lust.
[time=2666] - Okay, wait, I do not have a problem with lust.
[time=2669] - You don't have a problem with lust?
[time=2670] - No, I can quit anytime.
[time=2672] - Yeah.
[time=2673] - Okay, you know, maybe we could take a little break.
[time=2676] You know, I think I'm doing pretty good.
[time=2677] - You know, you are doing good, but when you look in the mirror, who do you see?
[time=2681] - Well, I see me.
[time=2682] - Okay, then I need to keep chiseling away because ultimately I need you and others to see my son.
[time=2687] Okay?
[time=2689] - You know, don't take this the wrong way, but when I start to look more like your son, people get really uncomfortable around me.
[time=2693] Like, even my church friends are like, "Whoa, you're holier than now.
[time=2697] Why won't you do that?" - So what you're saying is you'd rather play God over certain areas of your life, rather than let me be God over your entire life.
[time=2704] - I didn't say that.
[time=2705] - That's what you meant.
[time=2706] - Yes, it is.
[time=2708] - Ah, it's so hard to talk to you.
[time=2710] You know, everything I'm thinking, it's just, you know, I think you've done good work.
[time=2713] You know, we could take a little break, a little time.
[time=2715] I will come back to it.
[time=2716] - You know, what you're doing right now is common.
[time=2717] It's called control.
[time=2718] Now, would you rather control the things in your life or can I chisel?
[time=2721] Control, chisel, control, chisel.
[time=2723] - No, chisel.
[time=2725] But can we chisel where I wanna chisel?
[time=2727] - That's called control.
[time=2728] - Right.
[time=2729] - Yeah.
[time=2730] All right.
[time=2732] You know, are you sure you're ready for this?
[time=2734] You've been holding on to this for a really long time.
[time=2737] - Yeah?
[time=2739] - Okay.
[time=2740] - That hurts.
[time=2750] - It hurts me more than it hurts you.
[time=2752] - No, I don't think you understand this pain.
[time=2754] - Pain?
[time=2756] I know all about pain.
[time=2758] I sent my son to die for sin, for pain.
[time=2761] But I did it for another reason.
[time=2763] I did it to bring you freedom.
[time=2765] Do you know what insanity is?
[time=2767] Insanity is doing the same thing.
[time=2768] Over and over and over again.
[time=2771] They're expecting different results.
[time=2773] And there are things in your life that you've been doing since high school that do not work in your life.
[time=2778] And you turn to these empty wells whenever you're hurting, or you're tired, or you're lonely, or you're angry.
[time=2785] And they don't work.
[time=2786] - Okay, but I'm thinking that-- - Your thoughts are not my thoughts.
[time=2791] - Well, maybe if we went another way.
[time=2793] - Oh, your ways are not my ways.
[time=2796] Okay, look, I can't be good.
[time=2797] You can't be good.
[time=2800] I made you good.
[time=2802] Be good.
[time=2802] Oh, what?
[time=2806] - Nothing.
[time=2807] - What is it?
[time=2809] - You wouldn't understand.
[time=2810] - I got of all the universe wouldn't understand something that one of my children has to say.
[time=2816] Try me.
[time=2818] - It's just that I've let you down so much.
[time=2823] - No, you were never holding me up.
[time=2825] I hold you up with my victorious, righteous right hand.
[time=2829] In this relationship, I hold you up.
[time=2832] Don't you forget that.
[time=2833] - Okay.
[time=2836] Go ahead, but just be prepared for what you're gonna find in there.
[time=2842] 'Cause God, I know what's inside there.
[time=2845] God, I get up every morning, and I look in the mirror, and it's a scared little kid that just gets up every day and tries to dress like an adult and act like an adult, but it just can't.
[time=2857] So be prepared for what you're gonna find in there.
[time=2861] - You've listened to too many voices for far too long that are not of me.
[time=2865] You think you're junk, don't you?
[time=2868] You really, really think you're junk.
[time=2871] Listen to me, I don't make junk.
[time=2874] What would that say about me?
[time=2875] How can I prove to you that my love for you has no boundaries?
[time=2882] - I know.
[time=2883] Reach into your back pocket.
[time=2884] - What?
[time=2885] - Reach into your back pocket.
[time=2887] - Why?
[time=2888] - Are you gonna argue with me or reach into your back pocket?
[time=2890] - Oh, God.
[time=2891] - Yes.
[time=2893] - I was just saying, God, I'll do that right now.
[time=2897] - You are just taking my name in vain.
[time=2899] - Look, it's just a name or a saying.
[time=2902] - No, it's more than a name and more than a saying.
[time=2904] It's more than a bad habit.
[time=2906] It is the name above all names.
[time=2908] I wanna teach you something about my name.
[time=2911] Reach into your back pocket.
[time=2913] You know what that is?
[time=2917] - This is a page from the old journal I had when I was a kid.
[time=2920] - Yeah.
[time=2921] - How'd you get this?
[time=2921] - Hello.
[time=2922] - Oh, yeah.
[time=2923] (audience laughing) Hey, go ahead and read it.
[time=2926] - I love Angie Holland.
[time=2929] - Other side.
[time=2931] - I'm sorry.
[time=2931] I married her, you know.
[time=2932] - I was there.
[time=2933] - Oh, that's right.
[time=2934] - Yeah.
[time=2936] Dear God, today I'm turning everything over to you.
[time=2942] I'm not going to hold on to anything anymore.
[time=2945] Your word says that you will make me your masterpiece and use me to do great things.
[time=2953] I don't see how that's possible, but I want that with all that I am.
[time=2957] So please do whatever it takes to make me what you want.
[time=2962] I love you, God.
[time=2964] - I love you too, Tommy.
[time=2966] I love you too much to leave you where you are.
[time=2969] So this salvation that you hold, don't let it become some sentimental gush or some head knowledge.
[time=2976] I want you to work it out in every area of your life and don't compare yourself to others.
[time=2982] That's just trivial nonsense.
[time=2984] You, you are my original masterpiece.
[time=2990] You are my workmanship and you, I find favor.
[time=2995] - In this, don't think of this as a prison.
[time=3000] Look at this as a father disciplining his child.
[time=3003] A father disciplines the one he loves.
[time=3006] - I know, but it's going to be tough.
[time=3008] - It is going to be tough, but you bought into the lie that said this is going to be easy when you said yes to me.
[time=3013] It's not how this works.
[time=3015] I want you to do something.
[time=3018] I want you to look out there and say, Tommy is God's original masterpiece.
[time=3025] - Tommy is God's original masterpiece?
[time=3027] - No, no, not the way you see yourself or the way you fear others see you, but the way that I see you.
[time=3035] - Tommy is God's original masterpiece?
[time=3043] - Yes, you are.
[time=3045] - And so are you.
[time=3046] God doesn't make junk.
[time=3049] You are an original masterpiece.
[time=3056] (audience applauds) [MUSIC - 214 seconds]
[time=3281] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 29 seconds]
[time=3321] (audience applauding)
[time=3336] - Okay, would you stand with me quietly as we go this morning and let me just ask you this, I wanna pray for you.
[time=3344] I wanna pray that you'd have the courage.
[time=3347] I mean that.
[time=3348] The courage to allow God to chisel away at you.
[time=3353] Any part of you, any part of your heart, any part of your life, any part of your habits, any part of your routines.
[time=3361] I wanna pray for you that you'd have the courage to allow God to invite him to chisel so that he could continue to make you into this workmanship, this piece of art that he has designed to do good deeds.
[time=3375] And secondly, I wanna pray that you'd be having been chiseled on that you'd be open this week to maybe a level or a scope of engagement with the least of these, those who are hurting and those who are needy, the ones you know or the ones he may bring across your path.
[time=3391] I wanna pray that you'd have courage to let him chisel and I wanna pray for you that you'd be obedient as a child of God to give yourself lovingly and kindly and graciously and tenderly and sacrificially.
[time=3403] And if you'd be willing to let me pray that for you, raise your hand.
[time=3408] If you want me to pray those things for you, I mean it, look at me and raise your hand.
[time=3413] Okay, bow your heads, thanks.
[time=3417] Father, I'm gonna raise my hand back at these brothers and sisters.
[time=3420] And for those who raised their hands this morning, I pray God that you would give them the courage to allow you to hammer away, to chisel and chip at whatever you may need to chisel and chip at.
[time=3432] And oh God, give them a trust in you that would allow you to do that thoroughly and completely.
[time=3438] And oh God, would you also open their eyes and their hearts to the everyday opportunities that you bring across their path in their own home, in their neighborhood, on their street in this city, in this world, to give of themselves, to give away their resources, to give away their clothes, to give away their water, to give away whatever it is that might be needed by one in need.
[time=3464] May we act like and live like the redeemed who have truly inherited the kingdom of God.
[time=3473] Father, we love you.
[time=3475] We thank you for this time together this morning and all the people who were thankful in the room agreed and said, hey man, God bless you.
[time=3483] Good to be together and we'll see you next week.
[time=3485] (gentle music)
