[time=170] (upbeat music) - Deuteronomy chapter four, Lord, you are a consuming fire,
[time=194] a jealous God, first Kings 22.
[time=198] You, God, are seated on your throne with all the host of heavens standing by you on your right and on your left.
[time=205] In second Chronicles two, the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain you, O Lord.

[time=481] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=488] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege and it is that a privilege to be a part of this team at Black Hawk Ministries and we are so thankful that we get to offer those of you who watch week after week, thousands of you literally in this region.
[time=503] So thankful that we get to bring this broadcast and all that it entails to you and what I hope is a personal and encouraging way.
[time=513] You know, I've been thinking a lot about how it is that God brings people to this family.
[time=518] It's incredible week after week and I mean that to meet new people.
[time=522] And as I talk with them and as I hear their story, I realize that there are different ministries in the Black Hawk arena that God uses to bring new people all the time.
[time=532] And I wanna just tell you about just a couple of those.
[time=535] One is the Bible Hour, it's this right here.
[time=538] Every week I hear from somebody, every Sunday I meet somebody.
[time=544] There isn't a week that goes by that I don't hear about somebody who now calls Black Hawk home.
[time=549] And I mean that on a regular weekly basis, they're here and they're engaged and they're growing.
[time=555] And it's because they, like you, watched the Bible Hour.
[time=558] They may have watched it for two weeks and then they came.
[time=564] But as they watched, they began to sense that God had prepared for them a home and a family to be a part of.
[time=570] And I wanna just encourage you, if you're watching this morning and you've been watching and you really don't have a church home, I wanna encourage you to come to get in the car to invite a friend to bring your family in at nine o'clock or 1045 on a Sunday.
[time=585] There is a family waiting to get to know you.
[time=588] There is a place where you can grow and your life can be transformed because this is about the Word of God and the Spirit of God and the people of God.
[time=600] And when those things work together, people's lives get transformed.
[time=603] So come and be a part of what God's doing here.
[time=606] Another ministry that God's using is our school.
[time=609] And I wanna just say this to you.
[time=611] It's the time of year when people start thinking about school for their kids next year.
[time=616] Maybe you have young kids that are beginning to start school, pre-K or kindergarten.
[time=620] You may have kids that are already in school, but you've been thinking about maybe making a switch.
[time=627] Black Caught Christian School has for almost 40 years been making a spiritual and personal and academic investment in the lives of kids and their families for all these years.
[time=639] And it continues to simply grow in its commitment to excellence and its commitment to coming alongside families in a God-honoring way.
[time=648] I'd love for you to visit the website at the bottom of the screen here.
[time=651] Would love for you to call the number that's at the bottom of the screen and talk to somebody at our school.
[time=656] They would love to meet with you, provide you with a tour and any information that you might need.
[time=662] It's amazing as the weeks and months go by to meet people who are a part of our church who came because of the difference God made in their lives through our school.
[time=672] One other ministry that I keep talking to you about, but I just, I'm not gonna stop talking about it because God keeps doing miraculous things is our Celebrate Recovery Ministry that meets on Friday nights at seven.
[time=684] For anybody, and I mean that, for anybody struggling with the challenge and the fight and the battle of moving away from sin and its addictions, Celebrate Recovery, is a breath of fresh air, a home for you, a people who meet regularly to understand God's word and to encourage each other and to provide the much needed accountability for your fight and mine with sin.
[time=708] I can't tell you enough about what a difference this group has made in the life of this church.
[time=713] And if you're struggling with those things, if there are addictions in your life that you need help with, I hope you'll call the church office at this number, ask to be connected with someone from our Celebrate Recovery team and they'll get your information, they'll call you, we'll do everything we can to provide a safe place for you to hear a life changing message.
[time=735] And I again am so thankful for what I see God doing in that Celebrate Recovery family.
[time=741] Hey, these are just some examples of what God's doing.
[time=743] I hope you're encouraged as you hear about it.
[time=746] I hope you'll come and see us soon.
[time=749] It's an honor to get to have this relationship with you.
[time=751] I hope you have a great week.
[time=752] I hope today's message encourages you and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=757] God bless.
[time=759] [MUSIC - 18 seconds]
[time=785] I heard an old old story of how a Savior came from glory how He came His life on cavalry to save a wretch like me.
[time=797] I heard about His groaning of His precious blood, the Tony.
[time=804] Then I repented of my sins and won the victory.
[time=811] [MUSIC]
[time=839] Let's sing this next part together.
[time=841] [MUSIC]
[time=869] Victory in Jesus my Savior forever.
[time=875] He saw me and bought me with His redeeming blood.
[time=881] He loved me and I knew Him and all my love is to Him.
[time=888] He punched me to victory beneath the cleansing blood.
[time=896] [MUSIC - 56 seconds]
[time=963] Victory in Jesus my Savior forever.
[time=969] He saw me and bought me with His redeeming blood.
[time=975] He loved me and I knew Him and all my love is to Him.
[time=981] He punched me to victory beneath the cleansing blood.
[time=988] Oh, victory in Jesus my Savior forever.
[time=994] He saw me and bought me with His redeeming blood.
[time=1001] He loved me and I knew Him and all my love is to Him.
[time=1008] He punched me to victory beneath the cleansing blood.
[time=1015] Oh, yeah.
[time=1028] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=1048] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1053] You know what I'm going to do?
[time=1056] We're not going to mess around this morning.
[time=1057] We got so much to get to, and I'm so looking forward to it.
[time=1060] No opening story, no little small talk.
[time=1063] We're going to dive right into Ephesians 2, 11 to 14 in our ongoing study of the Book of Ephesians, the truth, the way, the life.
[time=1071] And it is the truth about our salvation, chapters 1, 2, and 3.
[time=1076] It is the way we are to live, chapters 4, 5, and 6, all of that when married, leading to the life that God intended for you and I.
[time=1085] So, I know you just did this, but I'm going to have you do it again in honor of God's word.
[time=1089] Would you grab your Bibles and would you stand?
[time=1091] And let me read this to you this morning at Ephesians 2, 11 through 14.
[time=1096] It says, "Therefore," and what does "therefore" mean?
[time=1100] Whenever you see "therefore," it always is pointing you back to what we just talked about, how we were dead in our trespasses and sin, how prior to redemption we walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, and how we were sons of disobedience, and we were lost in our lust and our flesh, but God in His great love and mercy made us alive together with Christ, amen?
[time=1129] Therefore, remember that formerly you, the Gentiles, and the flesh who are called uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision.
[time=1140] Look at that.
[time=1141] You, the Gentiles, and the flesh who are called uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision, they were already calling each other names.
[time=1151] Way back then.
[time=1153] We're going to talk about that this morning.
[time=1156] The uncircumcision, and the circumcision, calling each other names, circumcision, which is performed in the flesh by human hands.
[time=1162] Remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
[time=1175] But now in Christ reminds me of chapter 2, verse 4, but God, but now 13.
[time=1182] In Christ Jesus, you who formerly were far off have been brought near.
[time=1189] By the blood of Christ, for He Himself is our peace, who made both groups, the ones over here and the ones over there.
[time=1199] Both groups, He did into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall.
[time=1207] Father, God, our prayer this morning as we come back to Ephesians is that we could understand and see clearly.
[time=1216] And I know we make that difficult at times, but God, I pray this morning that your spirit and your word would supersede any distractions that we would bring or that the enemy would attempt to bring.
[time=1227] And God, that your word and your spirit would bring truth in great clarity and conviction and power to each of us.
[time=1236] We want to understand, God, this picture of unity.
[time=1240] We want to understand this picture of walls and barriers being broken and done away with God.
[time=1247] We want to understand how it is that you want the body of Christ to live and to think and to function.
[time=1253] And we get insights into that here in this passage today.
[time=1256] So God grow us and teach us, help us to be the people you've called us to be in your son's name, we pray.
[time=1262] Amen. You can be seated.
[time=1265] I think you'll see this on the screen.
[time=1267] I think you'll see it there at the top of your notes sheet.
[time=1269] I want you to take note of this, my friends, as human beings who have been tainted and scarred by sin, we build barriers.
[time=1278] As human beings who have been tainted and scarred by sin, we build barriers.
[time=1283] As we walk according to the course of this world, as we walk according to the prince of the power of the heir, as we walk as sons of disobedience, what happens is in time we separate from others for all kinds of reasons.
[time=1299] We build these walls, oftentimes erected with the mortar of hate
[time=1305] and pride, using bricks of intolerance and superiority and disdain.
[time=1312] And I'm going to tell you this in a number of different ways, a number of different times this morning, so I hope you'll catch this.
[time=1318] It's what our iniquity produces.
[time=1322] It is the result of our iniquity.
[time=1324] It's what our iniquity produces, and it's been that way from the very beginning.
[time=1329] Track with me if you would.
[time=1331] Abel's offering in Genesis chapter 4, Abel's offering to God in Genesis 4 was different than the offering that Cain brought, and God seemed to like Abel's better.
[time=1343] We don't know exactly why God liked Abel's better.
[time=1346] My guess is it probably had something to do with the heart with which the gifts were given, but the fact is Abel brought an offering.
[time=1353] His was different than Cain's.
[time=1355] God liked Abel's offering better, and Cain didn't like it that God didn't like his.
[time=1362] And he certainly didn't like his brother, because his brother's offering seemed to be deemed better by God.
[time=1369] And so in Cain's intolerance, and in Cain's disdain, the text says his countenance falls, his anger rises, and he wacks him, kills him.
[time=1384] Cain murders Abel.
[time=1387] You see it there on your screen, Genesis 4-8, and it came about when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.
[time=1397] Now it's the first murder ever recorded in Scripture, yes, but it's also the first I don't like you.
[time=1405] Pretty obvious, huh?
[time=1408] It's the first I'm superior to you.
[time=1411] It's the first you bother me, and I'll do anything to keep you down.
[time=1415] I'm up here, you're down there.
[time=1418] It's the first recorded case of severe disunity.
[time=1422] You say, "Wow, he killed him." Yeah, he did.
[time=1426] You say, "Where'd that come from?" Let me remind you again, my friends, sin and iniquity.
[time=1433] Remember what we've learned about sin in recent days, and what sin fundamentally produces.
[time=1440] You can write this down, I hope you will.
[time=1442] It'll be on the screen.
[time=1443] Sin, my friends, always has.
[time=1445] It's doing it today, and it always will.
[time=1447] Sin separates what was close and intimate in the presence of sin won't be close and intimate any longer.
[time=1455] Sin separates.
[time=1457] Sin alienates.
[time=1458] Those who were close are no longer intimate.
[time=1461] Those who were friends that friendship gets broken.
[time=1464] Those who used to be together are no longer together.
[time=1468] They are divided.
[time=1469] Sin separates.
[time=1471] Sin alienates.
[time=1473] Sin segregates.
[time=1476] I don't want to be with you anymore.
[time=1480] You don't want to be with them.
[time=1483] Sin separates.
[time=1484] Sin alienates.
[time=1486] Sin segregates.
[time=1487] It always has, and eventually it terminates.
[time=1490] It separates alienates.
[time=1492] Segregates and terminates.
[time=1495] Imagine how good that would have sounded if I was a black preacher.
[time=1501] Seriously, it would have sounded so much better.
[time=1506] But it's the truth, isn't it?
[time=1509] I'll tell you what, you can say yeah it is the truth, amen.
[time=1514] Maybe we should just stop for a moment and you should just think about.
[time=1519] Just so you're sure, maybe you should just stop and think about your sin and a relationship,
[time=1529] let's say.
[time=1531] Let's think about your sin and a relationship with your family, your sin and a relationship
[time=1538] with one that you love or love.
[time=1540] Let's think about your sin and those at work.
[time=1547] Think about some sin, we don't want to think about it a lot, I know, but just think about some sin that you've chosen, a sinful pattern or attitude that you've held on to and think
[time=1558] about what it did.
[time=1560] Go ahead, you can just in your mind, you can play it out.
[time=1562] It separates, doesn't it?
[time=1567] It alienates, it creates space where there didn't used to be and God never wanted there
[time=1573] to be, it separates and it alienates, it segregates and left unchecked, it what?
[time=1580] Terminates, kills us, kills you, kills me.
[time=1587] And separation, here's the point, separation and the termination that eventually comes with sin was never God's heart or ever God's design.
[time=1597] In fact, his first plan to remedy the separation sin had caused was absolutely brilliant.
[time=1605] You remember the plan, we see it just played out and unfolding in the pages of the Old
[time=1611] Testament.
[time=1612] He named the nation of Israel, the Jewish people, he named Israel his chosen people.
[time=1619] For this, Genesis 12, God designates that they will be his chosen favored people.
[time=1626] And he does set them apart from the other nations, that's true, but not for separation
[time=1632] sake, no, for the purpose, not for the purpose of exclusion, but to the contrary, he sets
[time=1639] them apart for eventually the purpose of inclusion.
[time=1643] God wanted Israel to be so unique and holy in their set of partners that the nations would
[time=1649] be redemptively drawn to God through Israel's restorative, reconciling love.
[time=1658] You see in God's design, it's always been about the different and the detached and the
[time=1665] distant being drawn to him and becoming one.
[time=1670] From the beginning, it has always been that way with God, the distant and the detached
[time=1678] being drawn together to become one.
[time=1681] This was God's heart.
[time=1683] This was God's plan.
[time=1684] He wanted to use Israel to accomplish this.
[time=1687] Go to Isaiah.
[time=1688] Come on.
[time=1689] Let me hear your pages turning.
[time=1690] Go in your Old Testament.
[time=1692] Go back to Isaiah 42.
[time=1695] Come on.
[time=1696] Turn those pages.
[time=1697] Isaiah 42, and I want to show you God's plan just in a couple of verses.
[time=1702] We could look at 50, but let me just show you a couple of verses where we see God's heart, how he wanted to use Israel to break down the barrier, to get rid of the walls,
[time=1712] to reach the nations, Isaiah 42, 6.
[time=1716] He says, "I am the Lord.
[time=1717] I have called you in righteousness.
[time=1721] I will also hold you by the hand and watch over you, and I will appoint you as a covenant
[time=1727] to the people, as a light to the nations, to open blind eyes."
[time=1733] This is what God wanted them to do to help him open blind eyes, to bring out prisoners
[time=1739] from the dungeon and those who dwell in darkness from the prison.
[time=1745] Flip over a few pages to Isaiah 49.
[time=1748] More of God's heart for the nations through his blessed people, Israel, 49, 6.
[time=1754] Says in Isaiah 49 verse 6, it says, "It is too small a thing that you should be my servant
[time=1762] to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved ones of Israel." That's a good thing, but that's too small a thing.
[time=1769] I will also make you a light of the nations so that my salvation, the God of the Bible
[time=1777] salvation, may reach to the end of the earth.
[time=1781] That's what God wanted.
[time=1782] That's what God wanted from the beginning that his salvation would reach to the ends of the earth, that the nations would be reached by his people whom he had chosen.
[time=1793] That was what he desired, but Israel, as most of you know in the room, Israel didn't cooperate
[time=1800] real well.
[time=1801] No, Israel refused to be faithful to this endeavor.
[time=1807] They toyed and they tinkered with the other nations' gods.
[time=1812] They were infatuated with Baal.
[time=1815] They partied at the Asher of Paul's.
[time=1817] They slept with their women and they reneged again and again and again.
[time=1825] They'd come back to God, they'd beg him for forgiveness.
[time=1828] He'd grant them forgiveness and another opportunity to reach the nations through their distinct and a holy living in love for him and again and again and again.
[time=1837] They reneged again and again and again.
[time=1839] They fell short again and again.
[time=1841] They said, "No, we don't want to do that.
[time=1844] It's not who we want to be.
[time=1845] It's not how we want to live." Could take you to a number of places where you would see this.
[time=1850] Maybe one of the most powerful places where you can see this is the story of Jonah.
[time=1854] Turn in your Bibles to Jonah chapter 4, if you would, it's an amazing description of
[time=1864] a hard and bitter heart.
[time=1868] Jonah had been called by God to go and to reach the people of Nineveh.
[time=1874] Many of you know that.
[time=1876] God wanted the Gentiles, the folks who weren't Jews in Nineveh to hear about him.
[time=1884] They wanted the message to be proclaimed.
[time=1887] I beat half of you in the room to Jonah.
[time=1888] I just want you to know that God wants the people of Nineveh to be reached and he calls
[time=1896] on our Jewish brother Jonah and he says, "I want you to go reach him." And Jonah says, "I don't want to go reach him.
[time=1903] He hops on a ship and he tries to run and the ship hits bad waters because this disobedient
[time=1910] Israelites on it and the waves get big and the guys figure it out and he gets tossed over and the big fish comes and swallows him up and he's in the belly of the whale and he says, "God, I'm sorry, okay.
[time=1921] I give, I'll go.
[time=1924] God has the fish, burp him up.
[time=1926] He gets out.
[time=1927] He goes to Nineveh.
[time=1928] He's still not happy about it.
[time=1931] He declares the truth in Nineveh.
[time=1934] The end of three, I won't read it all to you, but the end of three, if you start there
[time=1940] at about verse five, "Then the people of Nineveh believed in God." How great is that entire city?
[time=1949] And they call it a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them.
[time=1953] The whole city comes to faith in God and you want to know how deep the hatred between
[time=1962] Jews and Gentiles was.
[time=1963] You want to see how far it ran in their blood and in their bones and in their minds.
[time=1968] Look at Jonah, Jonah 4 1 to 3, but it greatly displeased Jonah.
[time=1976] And he became what, angry, why?
[time=1981] Because they all came to faith in God and he hated him.
[time=1986] Look what he says.
[time=1987] This kid's almost, it's so sad, it's not funny, but it's almost funny.
[time=1992] He prayed to the Lord.
[time=1993] This is like a prayer.
[time=1994] It's not, it's like a really bad prayer, but he prays to the Lord.
[time=1997] He says, "Please, Lord, was not this what I said, while I was still in my own country.
[time=2003] Therefore in order to forestall this, I fled to Tarshis, for I knew that you were a gracious
[time=2009] and compassionate God, slow to anger and abundant in loving kindness and one who relents
[time=2015] concerning calamity.
[time=2018] Therefore now, oh Lord, please take my life from me, for death is better to me than life
[time=2025] if life means none of us comes to faith in you because I hate them." They didn't like each other.
[time=2037] It ran deep.
[time=2040] And that stiff-necked, stubborn, unrelenting selfishness ran all the way through this
[time=2049] Old Testament drama as it unfolded, and you know what, as we come to the New Testament,
[time=2055] we fast forward to Ephesus and the pagan Greek culture of this day, the day of our study
[time=2061] of the book of Ephesus, it's still going on, the Jew-gentile thing still going on, but
[time=2068] now my friends, there's separation and there's segregation and there's alienation everywhere.
[time=2076] The New Testament times one of the greatest barriers, one of the greatest walls that had been established was between, listen, slaves and their owners, that's right.
[time=2087] Those who were free looked down on slaves as being inferior, slightly above animals.
[time=2093] Many slaves looked on their masters with contempt and resentment and hatred.
[time=2099] Consequently, one of the greatest problems of the early church, some of you don't even think about this, you wouldn't even have imagined that this was actually an issue, but when you kind of play it all out, it was.
[time=2110] One of the greatest problems of the early church was getting Christian slave owners,
[time=2118] Christian slave owners, and Christian slaves to treat each other as spiritual equals.
[time=2125] Talk about division.
[time=2127] Talk about walls.
[time=2130] Women were also looked down on, there was a divide, there was a chasm between men and
[time=2136] women.
[time=2137] Women were also looked down on as inferior beings.
[time=2140] Husbands often treated their wives little better than they did their animals or their slaves.
[time=2146] When a wife became a Christian, imagine this, when a wife became a Christian, her entire life outlook and value system changed.
[time=2155] An unbelieving husband would likely divorce her simply because she had made such a radical decision without his contempt, without his consent, separation everywhere.
[time=2167] We see division and distance everywhere.
[time=2172] The Greeks were so proud of their culture and supposed racial superiority that they considered
[time=2179] everyone else to be barbarians, a belief to which Paula Loods and Romans 1 and Colossians
[time=2185] 3.
[time=2186] And statesman Cicero wrote, as the Greeks say, "All men are divided into two classes, Greeks
[time=2194] and barbarians." And Livy, another ancient Roman, wrote that Greeks constantly waged a truthless war against
[time=2203] people of other races, all of whom they held to be intolerable animals.
[time=2212] And then, and then you had, you still had, the Jews and the Greeks.
[time=2218] And you thought Jonah, you thought Jonah had a bad attitude.
[time=2222] By this point in history, my friends, the divide, the chasm had grown even larger.
[time=2226] The hatred was even deeper.
[time=2229] It was a more bitter, ugly scene than ever before.
[time=2233] Jews, one writer wrote, "Jews hated Gentiles, and while they, as Jews, were more than willing
[time=2240] to accept God's blessing, they were still stiffnecked and unwilling to engage in His,
[time=2246] what?
[time=2247] His mission." And I want to, it's God's mission.
[time=2250] I mean, this is at the crux of our passage this morning.
[time=2254] This is really at the bottom of the truth that we're getting at here today.
[time=2259] It's God's mission.
[time=2260] It's what God now intended.
[time=2262] It's what now God was unfolding that was becoming so unnerving and maddening to the Jews.
[time=2268] And I want you to see.
[time=2269] I want you to see this morning God's mission.
[time=2272] I want you to see it clearly spelled out, and Paul does that for us in Ephesians 3.
[time=2277] Paul calls it the mystery of God.
[time=2280] Have you ever heard it referred to as that?
[time=2282] The mystery of God begins to be revealed here in the Epistles.
[time=2286] Paul, the one really specifically ordained by God to be the one who would deliver to the church the mystery that God was now revealing.
[time=2296] And I understand from all of my seminary days and all of my years of study.
[time=2300] I understand theologically why they call it the mystery I do.
[time=2305] But part of me always wondered why it was seen as such a mystery when from the very beginning God has always been about trying to break down those barriers and those walls.
[time=2316] God has always been about restoring.
[time=2318] He has always been about including.
[time=2320] He has always tried to redeem.
[time=2322] It's been His approach from day one.
[time=2325] Look at the mystery, Ephesians 3, Ephesians 3 verses 3 to 6.
[time=2330] This is really, really big stuff, my friends, that by here it is, that by revelation there
[time=2338] was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief, by referring to this, when
[time=2345] you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ which in other generations
[time=2352] see this hadn't been declared up until now, which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the spirit
[time=2365] to be specific that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body of Christ
[time=2376] and fellow partakers now of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
[time=2386] That my friends was enormous.
[time=2391] This was mind-boggling.
[time=2394] Like I said, it was maddening to the Jews and again I think I've, hopefully I've given
[time=2401] it, it's due description and I hope you understand this morning as you read those words.
[time=2406] I mean, you could take what would be probably in your lifetime and mine.
[time=2411] The most heated, the most deeply divisive, the most violent, the most awful, the ugliest
[time=2421] confrontations that you and I have ever experienced or seen or watched on the news when we talk
[time=2427] about the racial clash between African-Americans and whites and civil rights and dogs biting
[time=2436] and beatings and fire hoses and marches and assassinations.
[time=2441] I mean, in my lifetime it's one of the great conflicts in terms of racial divide and tensions
[time=2448] and bigotry and all those kinds of issues coming together.
[time=2452] It was explosive, literally it was nothing.
[time=2458] I mean, it was something but compared to this, I mean, there's some similarities there but
[time=2464] this is right along those lines and even more intense.
[time=2469] And when God said from here on out, "They're in, they're meaning non-Jew."
[time=2478] And He said to His people, "Hey, you know what?
[time=2480] From here on out, everybody who comes to me, everybody who bows the knee of their heart
[time=2486] to me, we are going to give every one a shot, everybody."
[time=2495] That was for many a great day and for many a Jew, it was the end for them.
[time=2502] And it's important, before we go any further this morning, it's really important that every one of you understand the implication of this for them, I hope I've painted that picture
[time=2513] for you, how difficult that was, how important it was though as well, for the church, for them.
[time=2519] I hope every one of you can understand how important this is for you and for me.
[time=2525] As God continues to grow here at 7,400 East State, a diverse community of disciples, as
[time=2533] He continues to in this neighborhood and in this community that He's given us the privilege of reaching into with a school and a church and a priesthood of believers.
[time=2545] It means everybody, my friends.
[time=2547] And I'm so thankful that more and more so today, this is a home, I'm so thankful that more and more so today, red, yellow, black, and white are finding this to be a place where
[time=2559] they are welcomed and encouraged and met with open arms where spiritual formation and our
[time=2566] desire to see the church be all that it can be is something that we hope for and wish
[time=2572] for for everyone.
[time=2574] No matter where you live, no matter how much money you make, no matter where you're going on vacation, no matter what kind of car you drive or don't drive, whether you take the bus work in a factory or downtown in a coat and tie, it just doesn't matter.
[time=2593] I want to read you some passages that this study just leads us to.
[time=2598] It really does.
[time=2599] Go to Colossians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, go to Colossians 3.
[time=2606] Let me just read this to you, Colossians 3.10 says, oh, sorry, that's 1 Thessalonians, Colossians
[time=2620] 3.10 and 9, it says, don't lie to each other since you laid aside the old self.
[time=2630] And Tenet says, and having put on the new self who is being renewed to a true knowledge
[time=2637] according to the image of the one who created him, a renewal in which there is no distinction
[time=2644] between Greek and Jew, no distinction between circumcised and uncircumcised, no distinction
[time=2651] between barbarians, Scythians, slave and freeman, but Christ is all and Christ is in all.
[time=2662] No more spiritual distinction, no more ethnic distinction, no more cultural distinction.
[time=2670] All of that right there.
[time=2672] Galatians 3, go back just after 1 and 2 Corinthians, you'll come to Galatians.
[time=2678] I want you to go to Galatians 3, 28.
[time=2684] For you 27, Galatians 3, 27, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed
[time=2693] yourself with Christ.
[time=2695] You got different clothes on now.
[time=2697] And with that new wardrobe, with the different clothes that you now have in Christ, verse 28, there is neither Jew nor Greek, no more.
[time=2706] There is neither slave nor freeman.
[time=2712] He goes that far for you are all, what, say it, one.
[time=2717] For you are all one in Christ Jesus.
[time=2723] And I'm grateful for that.
[time=2725] And I can't wait for you and I to continue to grow in our willingness and our readiness to embrace the opportunities God brings us.
[time=2733] There are still some of us in the room, still a few of us in the room, a little uncomfortable
[time=2741] with the poor because of what they want sometimes, because of how they look, because
[time=2748] of how they smell.
[time=2752] There's well-resourced people in this family, still a little uncomfortable because sometimes
[time=2758] it's hard for you to hear us say, sell your possessions and give to the poor.
[time=2765] And God's doing a work in many of you when it comes to how tightly you hold on to what and how willing you are to give.
[time=2773] And there's poor people in this place who have attitudes that need to be adjusted still.
[time=2778] You're resentful of the well-resourced and wish they'd give you more.
[time=2784] And there's still those in the room on the ethnic front were making progress.
[time=2788] But the thought of sharing not only a pew, but a life with someone red, yellow, black, or white, we've got to keep working on that.
[time=2797] And when I say we've got to keep working on that, the Spirit of God wants to keep working in you on that, and you and I need to be receptive and willing.
[time=2805] Because the Scriptures teach us this morning that the barriers are gone, that the walls have been torn down, be it ethnic, socioeconomic, spiritual, past, history, no matter what you were addicted to, no matter how nicely you were raised, no matter how you look, smell,
[time=2821] or where you live.
[time=2822] We are all one.
[time=2825] And God says that when we're one, then we experience His blessing and His power.
[time=2831] And I'm so thankful that He's moving us in that direction.
[time=2834] Lastly, this morning, I just have to show you this, it's all very related.
[time=2839] I want to show you how far, I want to show you how far He brought the Gentiles.
[time=2845] I want to show you this morning how separated and how alienated and how segregated they were.
[time=2852] I want you just to see in one fell swoop here, how far He brought them.
[time=2858] One through three Ephesians, all about what God did in salvation, I can't wait for you just to see.
[time=2863] It's a very graphic picture that gets painted.
[time=2866] And I want you to rejoice in what God did for non-Jews when the mystery was revealed
[time=2872] and everybody got a chance to come, how far He brought them.
[time=2878] Look with me back at our text, Ephesians 2, 11, 12, remember that you were, watch this,
[time=2888] remember that you were Gentile at that time, separate from Christ, excluded from the common
[time=2894] wealth of Israel, strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
[time=2901] They were, watch this, just kind of track down through those and write them down on your note sheet there.
[time=2906] They were without Christ.
[time=2907] Just think about that just for a moment.
[time=2909] They were, think about somebody being without Christ.
[time=2913] No redeemer, no rescuer, no Savior, no Messiah, no forgiveness, no nothing.
[time=2924] Lost and absolutely utterly alone, they were without Jesus.
[time=2932] They were, it says in the text, excluded from the common wealth of Israel.
[time=2936] They were excluded from Israel.
[time=2938] You could even shorten that by just saying, because this is the notion behind that statement, they were excluded from the family of God.
[time=2945] God had, God had put His favor on, listen, God had put His favor on the family of Israel.
[time=2951] God uses this as an example.
[time=2955] There were Gentiles who would not have known and many of you never knew what it was like to be a part of a family.
[time=2963] God protected Israel.
[time=2965] God had His hand on Israel.
[time=2968] God blessed Israel.
[time=2969] God, we're not talking about Uncle Guido, we're talking about God.
[time=2975] The God of the universe had their back wherever they went.
[time=2978] They had some troubles, but God was for them.
[time=2983] This is what Paul's saying.
[time=2985] You were excluded from the family of God.
[time=2990] You weren't a part of that protection.
[time=2992] You weren't a part of that blessing.
[time=2995] You were, without Christ, you were excluded from Israel.
[time=2999] You were strangers, Gentiles were strangers to God's promise as well.
[time=3003] Can you imagine, can you imagine not having any idea?
[time=3007] Can you imagine not having ever experienced the promises of God?
[time=3012] You say, what promises?
[time=3014] We'll just start thinking about it.
[time=3017] Think of all that He's promised you.
[time=3020] I started just writing them down this week.
[time=3022] I will hold you up, Kelly.
[time=3025] I will.
[time=3027] I will keep you.
[time=3028] I will not let you go.
[time=3029] I will deliver you.
[time=3031] I will never forsake you.
[time=3033] I will always be with you.
[time=3034] I will strengthen you.
[time=3036] I will encourage you.
[time=3037] I will envision you.
[time=3044] They never, ever understood or knew what it was like to have someone for them at that
[time=3051] level, to make those kind of promises and fulfill them.
[time=3055] They were without Christ.
[time=3057] They were excluded from the family.
[time=3058] They were strangers to promise.
[time=3061] These last two just are horrible.
[time=3065] They were hopeless.
[time=3070] Some of you in this room, I'm so thankful that I get to know you, and I'm so thankful that you share your lives and your stories with me.
[time=3078] Some of you in this room are so hopeful.
[time=3084] Because you're with Him, amen?
[time=3088] Do you understand, and a lot of you do, do you understand what hopeless is?
[time=3094] Hopeless is, you could say a lot of different ways.
[time=3099] Hopeless is nothing works, nothing.
[time=3108] It's when nothing works.
[time=3111] Nowhere you turn, know nothing that you give yourself to, nothing you chase after, nothing
[time=3117] ever works.
[time=3118] It's always empty, and you begin to see it and experience it more and more and more
[time=3124] so in your life.
[time=3125] And everywhere you turn, and all the things you try, it doesn't work.
[time=3131] And you're left in the emptiness of your humanness, you're left in the darkness of your flesh.
[time=3136] And I've been there, and many in this room have been there, and it's hopeless.
[time=3140] And that's where they lived.
[time=3142] That was the reality of their life.
[time=3145] And then they were hard to even say it.
[time=3148] I mean, it's just a little phrase, but the more I thought about it and looked at it all week, it's actually hard to say without God.
[time=3158] Can you imagine a godless existence, there's no God, well the text says they were without
[time=3165] God in the world.
[time=3168] For them it was as if he wasn't even there.
[time=3173] But God, because of his great mercy and the love with which he loved them, them being dead
[time=3184] in their trespasses and sin, lost in their iniquity, made us alive together with who,
[time=3192] with Christ.
[time=3195] That is an amazing picture.
[time=3198] I love how the section we're in here ends for he himself is our peace who made both groups into one, no more groups, no more divides, no more them and us.
[time=3207] No more us over here, them over there.
[time=3209] No more uncircumcision, circumcision.
[time=3211] No more different colors of skin, no more different sizes of checkbooks for he himself is our peace who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing
[time=3222] wall.
[time=3223] Hey, I want you to see something before we go, Corbin, would you come up here and we're going to close?
[time=3228] Let me just invite you not to go anywhere, but let me just show you something on the screen.
[time=3232] Anyway, how distant were the Gentiles, but let's just make sure this morning that we don't leave without making this as personal and as real as it can be.
[time=3241] How far away, how distant are you?
[time=3246] And I know some of you in the room this morning, and I'm so thankful, God's let me get to know you.
[time=3251] And I know you're thinking these things through.
[time=3255] And the fact of the matter is, and you know that we love you, you know that we respect you on your journey, but the fact is, even though you've been thinking it through, this
[time=3267] is you without him.
[time=3271] You don't get some of him.
[time=3274] You don't get some of the blessing.
[time=3275] You don't get some of the benefits when you're sort of thinking it through.
[time=3283] And I just want you to be able to real honestly say to yourself that without him, you're without Christ, you're excluded from the family, you're strangers to God's promises.
[time=3292] So don't claim him.
[time=3293] You're a hopeless.
[time=3294] Nothing works, and you are minus the bowing of the knee of your heart to him.
[time=3300] You're without God.
[time=3302] And we would, we would never want that for you.
[time=3306] And so we would just give you a chance this morning, whoever you are, whatever your road has been like, wherever you have traveled.
[time=3314] Maybe today is the opportunity God has provided for you to fully surrender your heart and life to him, to become part of the body of Christ.
[time=3323] It's quite a body.
[time=3325] It's a diverse piece of work.
[time=3329] It's a workmanship we learned last week, created by him for us all to do good things.
[time=3335] So come and join him, and you can just pray to him.
[time=3340] You can say these words to him this morning.
[time=3342] Now your head's right now, all of you.
[time=3344] And if God's moving in your heart this morning to just cry out to him, you can just cry out
[time=3350] in words like this, "Oh God, I know I am a sinner, and I know God my sin has separated
[time=3358] me from you.
[time=3360] It has alienated me.
[time=3362] I am without your son.
[time=3365] I am excluded from a family I would love to be a part of.
[time=3371] I'm a stranger to your promises, and I don't want to be.
[time=3376] I am hopeless.
[time=3379] It's not working.
[time=3381] I need your help.
[time=3384] And I'm without you.
[time=3385] Oh God, you can just say this to him, "Oh God, please forgive me." Because of what your son did on the cross, I know you can forgive me, all of my sin,
[time=3396] and welcome me into your family today.
[time=3400] I can be with Christ.
[time=3402] I can be a participant in your promises.
[time=3405] I can have hope, and I can be with you.
[time=3409] And if you're praying those kinds of words this morning know that he hears you, and he's forgiven your sins, and he has redeemed you.
[time=3419] And welcome, welcome those whose hearts are broken this morning into your family.
[time=3424] A life-changing, eternity-altering commitment.
[time=3429] And oh God, may you give us the privilege to know them and the days to come.
[time=3434] May they communicate with a good and trusted friend.
[time=3437] May they shoot us an email tomorrow.
[time=3440] May they come down front at the end of the service and let us celebrate in their new life and their new decision.
[time=3447] Most importantly, God, may we function with them as part of this body in a way that would
[time=3453] honor you without barriers and without walls.
[time=3456] May we be a loving, diverse community of disciples willing to go across the street, across the
[time=3463] cubicle, across the world to pass along your attributes to others.
[time=3470] Thank you for this time this morning.
[time=3472] Thank you for the great truth of Ephesians 2.
[time=3475] The Bible Hour is underwritten today by a family grateful for the Ministry of Black Aw Christian School.
[time=3481] They are thankful for the influence the staff and students have had on their family, and they encourage other families to visit the school during the open house on Tuesday, February 9th from 6 to 8 p.m.
[time=3492] to see how their family can also be impacted by BCS.
