[time=121] (audience applauds) - Hi everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=128] It's great to have you with us, and I want you to know how thankful I am that you've tuned in today, because what you're about to see, I think, was a powerful experience for our family here at Black Hawk, and I think it has the potential to be a very powerful experience for you.
[time=144] What you're about to see in these next few minutes are, number one, a persecuted church.
[time=151] That's right, you're about to hear the story.
[time=153] The real story, it's not a drama, it's not something that got cooked up, it's the reality for Christian brothers and sisters of ours today who live in a place far away.
[time=165] They live in the horror, and they live in the torment of persecution.
[time=170] And I think as you watch it, your eyes will be opened and your heart will be broken, and I believe God has some things for you and I to consider and think about as we hear the story of the persecuted church.
[time=181] Secondly, you're gonna hear about a friend of mine, a good friend of mine, and part of our family here at Black Hawk, a doctor, a surgeon who recently came back from over a week in Haiti.
[time=193] He went with others to do their very best to provide relief and support and encouragement for those who suffer still today from all that happened with the earthquake and the events that followed.
[time=205] It's a riveting story, and one, I can't wait for you to hear, and then you'll also hear today about a couple from our own family, our worship pastor, Corbin Miller and his wife, Tanya, who we sent away this past week to Ethiopia, Corbin and Tanya on their way to Ethiopia to put their arms around and their hearts around their new little daughter, Tanash, who will be coming home with them soon.
[time=231] It was an amazing morning, I can't wait for you to hear and take in all of it, and my prayer is this.
[time=238] My prayer is that God would move in you today, stir in your heart and make it impossible for you and for me.
[time=246] It's been my prayer as well, that God would make it impossible for you and I to sit still any longer, to sit in our comfort and ease and miss out on the life that he called us to live.
[time=259] I hope your heart is encouraged, and I'm so thankful that you've tuned in, it means a lot to us that we get to spend this time together.
[time=266] God bless you, open your heart and your mind to what he has for you today.
[time=271] And as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=366] (audience applauding)
[time=378] - Praise the Lord for that truth.
[time=383] That He's our shield, that He's our glory, and the lifter of our heads.
[time=390] Jim read for you at the beginning from Psalm three, which is the place in the Bible where that song comes from.
[time=399] And what Jim read when something like this, it was with the choir saying they said, it's a song of David when he's being attacked.
[time=405] And he says, "Many are they increased that trouble me." And he says, "Many are they that are rising up against me, and many there be which say of my soul, there's no help for you in God." And maybe you feel like that this morning.
[time=422] Maybe you feel like there's many troubles rising up against you.
[time=426] Maybe you feel like there's a lot of foes in your midst.
[time=429] Maybe you feel like there's a lot of people scoffing your direction saying, there's no help for you in God.
[time=435] But then David's response is, but thou, O Lord, are a shield for me.
[time=442] And imagine a shield in wartime, it's protecting the body.
[time=448] And the body, instead of taking the blunt of the arrows and the blunt of the bullets or the blunt of the spear, the body doesn't take that, the body stays intact, but it's the shield that takes the blow.
[time=461] And how cool is it that our God, when many there be which say of my soul, there's no help for you in God.
[time=468] I don't take the blow, but he takes the blow.
[time=471] And he's a shield for us, and he is our glory, and he is the lifter of our heads.
[time=478] I don't think that David in Psalm 3 was unaware of what people were saying, because in the first couple of verses, he says, "Many there be which say this of me." So he's hearing it, and those arrows are piercing his ears.
[time=495] The accusers are coming, and they're saying what they'll say, and he hears it, but he's not putting his hope in the midst of that.
[time=502] Circumstance or in the midst of the temporal, but he's fast forwarding in his mind to the truth of the future, and the truth of the eternal, and the truth of the promise of God that he's gonna be a shield.
[time=515] You see, David knew that back in Genesis, when God was calling people to be his, and in Genesis 15, God said to Abraham, "You and your people, I'm gonna be a shield for you." And so David was recalling in his heart the truth.
[time=528] In Genesis 15, after this, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision.
[time=531] Do not be afraid, Abram, I am your shield.
[time=535] Your very great reward, and even in the midst of the hardship David was facing, he was reminded that God is his shield.
[time=542] For you today, I wanted to remind you of the ultimate truth of God as a shield.
[time=550] This cross in the center of our stage is a great representation of the shield of God.
[time=558] And in the ultimate sense, outside of maybe your particular circumstance or how you're feeling, but in that ultimate spiritual sense, Christ is our shield, and he's the one that took the blows on our behalf, and God made him even without sin to be sin on our behalf so that we might become the righteousness of God, and as Christ hung on the cross in our place, he shielded us from eternal damnation, and he shielded us from eternal pain and suffering, and he shielded us from the wrath of God, and he shielded us from the abandonment that he felt on the cross from his heavenly father.
[time=596] Let me read for you in the book of Isaiah, in chapter 53, as you think of Christ as your shield.
[time=603] Just remember, yet it was our weaknesses that he carried.
[time=608] It was our sorrows that weighed him down, and though his troubles were a punishment from God, excuse me, and we thought his punishments were a, excuse me, excuse me again, and we thought his troubles were a punishment from God, a punishment for his own sins, but he was pierced for our rebellion, crushed for our sins.
[time=631] He was beaten so that we could be whole.
[time=633] He was whipped so that we could be healed.
[time=636] All of us like sheep have strayed away.
[time=638] We have left God's paths to follow our own, and yet the Lord laid on him the sins of us all, and Christ was our shield in that way.
[time=650] We're gonna sing another song that mentions God as shield and the strong tower and the provider and the one who gives us our portion, and as we sing this next song, I just wanna invite you today to maybe worship in the way that you feel the Spirit's prompting you to worship today.
[time=666] Maybe the posture of worship you need today is to just sit and be sung over.
[time=671] Maybe you're weary from the attacks coming at you at all sides, and you want us to sing over you truth, and we'd be glad to do that for you this morning, and maybe through this next song, you just wanna sit and listen.
[time=682] Maybe you feel like God is your glory, and the lifter of your head, and you wanna stand to your feet and sing out the truth of this next song, even though you're in the midst of some difficult circumstances, and we will invite you to do that too, if you feel led.
[time=700] And maybe this morning too, you wanna sing this song on behalf of someone you love.
[time=705] Recently, with our adopted child in Ethiopia,
[time=711] I found some song lyrics that I've been praying and singing on her behalf.
[time=716] There's a line in a song that we all sing a lot about God redeeming the wasted years, and I think about the last two years of her life, and I sing on her behalf a lot that God would be her rebuilder and her restoreer, and that he would redeem those wasted first two years of her life alone and hungry.
[time=735] And maybe there's somebody this morning that you know who's going through some hard stuff, and you wanna sing this next song on their behalf.
[time=740] And so as you feel led, as we sing, just worship God in any one of those ways.
[time=746] Sit and be sung over, stand, and declare the truth, or sing these words on behalf of someone you know and love.
[time=752] (gentle music)
[time=776] [MUSIC - 76 seconds]
[time=863] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 13 seconds]
[time=893] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 171 seconds]
[time=1098] - If you've ever felt the comfort and the protection, if you've ever been able to just sit there while the battle rages around you and have sensed what it's like to have your God and his shield around you say amen.
[time=1121] Amen, Father, know how grateful we are for the protection and the comfort and the peace and the security of your shield.
[time=1132] God, thank you for being a strong tower.
[time=1135] Thank you for being a place that we can run into.
[time=1139] And while we are called to keep moving forward while effort is required, while choices have to be made, sometimes that are very difficult.
[time=1148] God, we know that in the end, as Corbin said, circumstantially, you love us, yes, and you will walk with us.
[time=1156] But your shield, while it brings blessing and comfort in the fray, God, it is our ultimate peace that you have secured.
[time=1166] And all of those who knew him in the room were thankful for that and said amen.
[time=1174] And Father, God, we say that to you again, amen.
[time=1177] Amen, and thank you for your great grace and love and your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1182] [AMEN] I'll tell you what, every, by about eight o'clock
[time=1193] or so, every Sunday night, my mind and my heart are already engaged, thinking about what God is doing in the midst of whatever study we might be in.
[time=1203] My mind begins to think about the next Sunday morning.
[time=1206] And this week was no different, and as Monday comes along, I'll usually try my very best to have a real clear sense of where God is leading, and outline will be prepared, and I'll begin to read and write, and it's exciting, and enjoying, and sometimes challenging, and convicting process.
[time=1224] And then by Tuesday, we're off and running, and everything begins to take shape.
[time=1228] But something happened this week.
[time=1231] And I wasn't expecting it, and it wasn't in the plan, if you will.
[time=1238] But it happened, and I just couldn't ignore it, and let me try and explain it to you here for a minute, and it has changed what we're going to do this morning, so bear with me here.
[time=1250] Tuesday morning, I went to staff prayer.
[time=1252] Every Tuesday, all the people at work here at Blackhawk, we get together for a prayer time led each week by Corbin and Janice Marisi, they give leadership to that, and it's a sweet time, and it goes in different directions.
[time=1265] I'm thankful for how they do that, and this week, Corbin had asked Beth Armstrong, one of our team members, to come, and to just give us a report on something that really is near to Beth's heart, Beth, on a regular basis, just because I think God's putting on her heart.
[time=1281] She tracks and keeps up with a number of websites having to do with the persecuted church.
[time=1290] And I just want you to know this morning that for many of you, and I know that phrase seems a long, long way away.
[time=1298] And in many cases, it is a long way away, but I want you to be reminded this morning, as we were Tuesday morning, that it is a reality.
[time=1309] And I thought it was so amazingly appropriate that last week, we found ourselves in Ephesians 2, and in our passage last week, we were reminded that no matter who you are, Jew or Gentile, no matter where you're from, Greek or Scythian, no matter slave or free, man or woman, anybody, anywhere who bows the knee of their heart and surrenders themselves to Christ, is now a part of one body.
[time=1335] Amen?
[time=1337] And so as we sat there Tuesday morning, and Beth gave us the report on the persecuted church, there was just something in me, it just struck a chord, and I've heard about it, and I've read about it for years, and we've talked about it in here, but last Tuesday morning, it just floored me.
[time=1354] As I was reminded of the reality of what our, our, your brothers and sisters, my brothers and sisters in Christ are facing today right now in this world of ours.
[time=1372] And so I wanted to just, if I could share with you this morning what was shared with us that morning, and I hope that, I hope you understand, I wouldn't do this.
[time=1383] I was all ready to go on Ephesians.
[time=1385] I wouldn't do this if I didn't feel God really prompting me to do it, and, and then there are some other things that He brought to my heart as the wheat progressed, and I kind of sensed it all coming together.
[time=1395] So I hope you sense Him in this, but I just want to say right now that what you're about to hear isn't pretty, it will be disturbing for, for all of you, I'm sure, but I think it's something that we need to be reminded of and something that we need to be aware of and something that you and I need to be willing to give thought to.
[time=1414] The persecuted church.
[time=1418] Each year, Open Doors, USA, an organization that really as the days go by keeps a watch over the level of persecution all over the world, Open Doors releases the World Watch List.
[time=1430] It's a detailed analysis of Christian persecution worldwide.
[time=1435] Countries are evaluated and ranked according to the severity of persecution that occurred within their borders over the past year.
[time=1444] This year, again, I think for the sixth year in a row, North Korea, again sits at the top of the list.
[time=1453] There is no other country in the world today where Christians are being persecuted in such a horrible and systematic manner, says Karl Moller, president and CEO of Open Doors, USA.
[time=1465] One expert on North Korea stated Christians are the target of fierce government action and once caught are not regarded as human.
[time=1474] Last year, we have evidence, he says, that some of those captured were used as guinea pigs to test chemical and biological weapons.
[time=1483] Christians continue to experience severe persecution.
[time=1489] The only worship allowed in North Korea is that of the beloved leader, Kim Jong Il, and his father, Kim Il Sung.
[time=1501] Christians are seen by these men and their regime as a threat, so increasing numbers have been sentenced to horrific conditions in labor camps or secretly executed.
[time=1513] Last year, the North Korean regime of Kim Jong targeted Christians all over the country,
[time=1519] which resulted in arrests, torture, and killings, according to Open Doors' annual World Watch List.
[time=1526] North Korean leaders are desperately trying to control society in order to eradicate all Christian activities.
[time=1534] If you go back a slide, Katie, I want to show you what Katie and Beth came up with.
[time=1538] There you see all those little flags, all those little markings on that map.
[time=1543] Those are all current day concentration camps in North Korea where Christians are taken today.
[time=1551] There are an estimated 200,000 North Koreans in political prisons,
[time=1559] including 40 to 60,000 Christians, says Open Doors.
[time=1564] As the North Korean economy continues, its slow-motion collapse, reports of worsening persecution of Christians are coming out of North Korea, he adds.
[time=1574] 2010 is forecast to be a year of tremendous hardship and food shortages since the country's harvest in 2009 was a poor one.
[time=1584] Two North Korean refugees spelled out the deteriorating situation to release international,
[time=1590] and I quote, "The situation in the North is getting worse," said former prisoner, King Chohuan.
[time=1597] It is like a giant prison camp has crossed the land.
[time=1601] Starvation spreads out over the entire nation. It has become the norm.
[time=1608] He goes on to say, "I lived in Yoduk prison camp for ten years.
[time=1613] I was treated like an animal there.
[time=1616] I had watched many people die from starvation and beatings.
[time=1619] I witnessed open execution and watched helplessly as people died miserably.
[time=1625] These fearful scenes have not left my mind." As I went on to read about this as the week progressed, I read stories, documented stories of families, Christian families who would not bend
[time=1642] and who would not break in their declaration of their love for him, families being herded into open fields and with friends and relatives watching families being executed, with pictures being taken and then delivered to those who knew those families in prison.
[time=1665] I read about a missionary woman, my own mother's age.
[time=1671] I read about a missionary woman who was captured and tortured, all of her teeth and fingernails ripped out in an effort to squelch her spirit and her devotion to her God.
[time=1685] Our reports today from Christians having escaped from prison camps talking about torture chambers where battery acid is used to burn and disfigure in where the severity of the beatings leaves men and women crippled, scarred and even dismembered.
[time=1701] One report revealed a governmental tactic that would allow select individuals who had experienced and somehow survived
[time=1710] the worst of the torture to be sent home.
[time=1715] And in order for their families to see their amputated limbs, their scarred bodies and their disfigured faces with the hope that their faith would be discouraged and eventually squelched,
[time=1732] having seen the reality of such atrocities.
[time=1737] It's an amazing story.
[time=1743] It's really happening today.
[time=1747] And while there are some governmental from beyond North Korea,
[time=1754] while there is pressure mounting on the human rights front and while some progress is being made and while there are missionaries today underground in North Korea trying to provide places of safety and refuge,
[time=1768] it continues to be dark and horrific.
[time=1773] But as I'm reading all this, here's the point so many things I want to say to you, but here's the one thing I just had to share with you.
[time=1780] Because I'm reading all this, so I'm just making my way through page after page and website after website.
[time=1788] You come across an amazing, shocking,
[time=1795] stirring, unbelievable piece of data.
[time=1802] And the unbelievable, amazing, shocking piece of data that you come across as this.
[time=1809] Guess what real objective data?
[time=1813] Guess what statistics in North Korea tell us is on the rise?
[time=1824] Guess what's gaining momentum in the midst of that?
[time=1833] Guess what's on the rise? Go ahead, say it. Christianity.
[time=1840] Guess what's not declining?
[time=1843] Guess what's not being discouraged or squelched in any way, Christianity.
[time=1851] The church in the midst of all of this is growing and I wrote down on my little piece of paper here
[time=1857] and I just circled it. I just said, why?
[time=1863] How is this?
[time=1867] And I'm asking you this morning to think about this.
[time=1872] I don't want you to answer it out loud today, but part of me would love to just talk to you about it.
[time=1878] Why? How does this happen?
[time=1884] Why does Christianity become more attractive in a place where Christians are murdered
[time=1893] and less attractive in places where spiritual freedom runs rampant?
[time=1900] Why is it that in spiritually free America where hundreds of millions of dollars get spent each year
[time=1908] on elaborate church campuses and the Christian message where Christian networks and ministry websites
[time=1915] and Christian books are everywhere you look, why is it that in a country like that the number of Christians is declining?
[time=1924] I think most of you knew that, didn't you? The number of Christians in America is declining.
[time=1931] There are not more of us, there are less of us today.
[time=1937] And yet in North Korea, in a country with no Christian freedom at all where Christians are routinely rounded up like cattle
[time=1946] beaten towards your dismembered, disfigured, humiliated, imprisoned and murdered, the number of Christians is on the rise.
[time=1956] Why is this?
[time=1961] Well, I'd love to hear your answers. I told first hour I'm going to tell you I mean it.
[time=1969] I'd love to see you. I mean this. I'd love to see you go home today and talk about it.
[time=1975] I wonder what you'd come up with. I wonder if you as a family or you as a couple or you as a bunch of friends
[time=1982] or you as a small group and the days to come, I wonder if you really sat down and thought this through and asked
[time=1988] "Wait a minute, how is it that that is occurring? What does that tell us? What does that show us?
[time=1995] What can we learn from this?" I wonder what you'd come up with.
[time=2002] I think there's a lot to come up with. I just, I wrote a few things down. One thing that came to my mind is this.
[time=2009] One reason why I believe this is happening is because at its core, way down deep inside the human soul is drawn to that which is real.
[time=2019] Does that make sense? The human soul is drawn, I believe, at its core to genuine faith.
[time=2026] When the human soul, far from God, encounters genuine faith, shallow faith repels the searching soul.
[time=2034] Weak and self-serving faith doesn't fool or attract anyone. When the human soul, far from God, encounters the unspeakable courage
[time=2046] and humility of a life lived and sacrificed for a cause beyond itself, something happens.
[time=2055] When the human heart encounters a life lived out in utter security and peace, even in the midst of hate and ridicule,
[time=2063] when the human heart sees that, when the human heart encounters this, it softens.
[time=2070] It's drawn to the source of that faith. When the godless human heart encounters a courageous, obedient, resilient faith,
[time=2079] people say yes to a faith that will cost them their life. And I believe that with all my heart.
[time=2090] So it just leads me to ask you and it leads me to ask of myself all over again, how's your faith?
[time=2100] What does it look like lived out? No one's going to beat you tonight.
[time=2106] No one's going to take my kids from me tomorrow and use them as guinea pigs with battery acid.
[time=2115] I still believe you and I, if intentional, and if sincere in our effort could probably live out our faith with a greater degree of courage
[time=2127] and a greater degree of integrity and a greater level of sacrifice.
[time=2133] And I believe when faith gets lived out that way, it makes a difference in its world.
[time=2138] David, excuse me, Daniel got kidnapped and imprisoned. Remember that? They tried to brainwash him.
[time=2145] They threw him in front of a bunch of lions. He endures all kinds of hardship and ends up ruling there in Babylon with Nebuchadnezzar.
[time=2153] Joseph mistreated, sold into slavery, seduced, wrongly accused, thrown in prison.
[time=2160] Paul beaten times without number. The early church faced its version of persecution as it grew.
[time=2167] Christians were being fed to the lions, murdered in the Colosseum, burned alive as tiki torches at Nero's garden parties.
[time=2177] And the church grew and God was honored.
[time=2184] People aren't wowed by the glitz and the glamour, my friends. They are stirred and moved by a belief in faith so strong it will sacrifice everything to be found faithful.
[time=2196] And so while I want to pray this morning for the church in North Korea, I think we should pray for ourselves as well.
[time=2203] Would you look at the screen and would you just make note of these things, some things to pray for, the delivery of spiritual and physical aid?
[time=2211] There is some of that moving in that direction that the delivery of spiritual and physical aid will reach the most needy of the estimated 400,000 believers.
[time=2220] But the estimated 50 to 70,000 believers in labor camps today, right now this morning, will know God's shield.
[time=2231] And didn't even know Corbin was going to talk about all that this morning.
[time=2235] But the shield of God and the comfort and the protection that comes from that, that they would know God's love and comfort in their distress.
[time=2244] For wisdom and strength, for believers on the run, there are many today running, hiding, trying to stay alive.
[time=2251] We could pray for them that they would know His protection and we could pray for each other.
[time=2256] That our unpersecuted church, that our lives that day in and day out go forward in unbelievable ease,
[time=2273] and luxury, an unthreatened provision that we could somehow know and experience, a courageous faith willing to live differently and distinctly.
[time=2290] In a world postured completely and totally against our king and his kingdom.
[time=2299] Would you bow and would you just keep these things on your heart and in your mind?
[time=2306] I kind of just want you to pray and I just would invite you to do so now in your heart.
[time=2311] I can just guide others of you.
[time=2313] Father God, you know that there are many, many in the room this morning and we would want nothing more than to just be a blessing to our brothers and sisters.
[time=2326] These are people who are a part of our family.
[time=2330] We are one in your son and God, we lift them up to you today.
[time=2336] We lift up their families.
[time=2338] We lift up their sons and their daughters.
[time=2340] We lift up moms and dads and in the midst of the sorrow and the fear and the severity of the moment.
[time=2351] Oh God, we pray that you would give them great hope for the future.
[time=2356] God, we pray for those who are on the run today, right now those who hide in fear of their lives, who will not renounce their faith, who in the next few days or weeks may in fact be captured or they may in fact find freedom and refuge in other places.
[time=2373] Oh God, I pray. We would pray today as a family that you would watch over them.
[time=2379] And God, would you stir us in our hearts?
[time=2384] Would you move us God in places?
[time=2386] And I don't even know how to say it.
[time=2388] It's hard to even articulate, but God, I know in my life and I know in the lives of my friends in this room that there is a way of living God.
[time=2397] There is a path of obedience and faith that if walked would lead us to greater opportunities, to stand for all that is true and right and good.
[time=2411] May we do it in our homes, may we do that in our neighborhoods, may we do that in our schools.
[time=2416] God, give our students today courage in their schools and in their classrooms to with great appropriate grace and sensitivity at the same time with great boldness and courage, stand for what's right.
[time=2433] May our kids and may we as parents choose to be uncommon in a world where everyone wants to be the same.
[time=2443] And may our uncommon stand be rooted in the great truth of your word and the relationship we have with your son.
[time=2450] God, we pray all of this. We hope all of this and give all of this to you.
[time=2457] And the church at Blackhawk agreed and said, amen.
[time=2463] So I'm thinking through all the things going on in North Korea, my mind and my heart.
[time=2469] Just be kind of in the midst of all that, they just kind of went away from here.
[time=2476] And as my mind and heart went away from here, then it dawns on me that on Saturday, this was about Wednesday or Thursday, about I realized Saturday, and my friend Matt Hicks was coming home from Haiti where he had gone to be with the people who desperately needed the shield of God.
[time=2494] And Matt, I want to ask you to come on up if you would. Matt and Lisa and the girls are part of our family here at Blackhawk.
[time=2499] They've been a part of our family for years. Matt is an orthopedic trauma surgeon here in town at Fort Wayne Orthopedic, and we're so thankful for him.
[time=2510] Personally, he's a friend, and as far as part of his family, he's just been a faithful part of Blackhawk.
[time=2518] And I want you to hear from Matt how this whole trip came to be. It's an amazing story.
[time=2524] I'm going to have him just share with you how it is he ended up in Haiti a while ago.
[time=2529] And he's going to show you some pictures as he talks about that, and then I'm going to ask him a question or two at the end.
[time=2535] But I just want you to be encouraged. We've been talking about for quite a while you and I being willing, every one of you,
[time=2543] being willing to be a priest, who what? Who goes? And we've tried to not program that.
[time=2550] In fact, we've gone out of our way to tell you. It's just really about you living in relationship with God,
[time=2556] being willing to be grown in that relationship and say to him, "God, I want to go. I want to go across the street.
[time=2561] I want to go across the town. I want to go across the world. I'll go anywhere you want me to go to engage with those who need you."
[time=2567] Send me. It's amazing to see more and more of you going.
[time=2572] And Matt got a chance to go, and I wanted him to just share with you how that all came to be.
[time=2576] So Matt, tell him how it is you ended up on a plane heading to Haiti.
[time=2580] Good morning. Welcome, Matt. Say hello to Matt.
[time=2584] Good to have him up here. It's been a pretty amazing last couple of weeks.
[time=2591] This was not on my life's agenda two weeks ago, but this is all about what God did and really not much about me.
[time=2599] I'll even say the story doesn't even begin a couple of weeks ago.
[time=2604] I would say the beginning of this began last summer when I went as a support staff member for the RAF trip
[time=2611] I asked my pastor Bob and Tom Cash if they run the last 18 years and I met the other support staff people down there and one of them.
[time=2618] His husband gave me a call last Monday night asking just saying hi and then he asked if I had any interest in going to Haiti and doing some medical work.
[time=2628] And in general I said, "Sure. I'm interested in going. The earthquakes devastating and a lot of people are hurt."
[time=2634] And I said, "Well, we're leaving Wednesday. Would you like to go?" And it's a little bit of an interesting question.
[time=2642] I said, "Well, which Wednesday first?" And he said, "In 36 hours." And you know, much is in your lives trying to arrange your life to change for next 10 days and 36 hours is not easy.
[time=2655] So I said, "Let me talk to my wife and I'll call you back." And at that point we were down at Manchester High School with my daughter watching her play basketball.
[time=2663] And we talked for a little bit and I called back Jared who goes to Pathways who helped arrange this and said,
[time=2671] "I think I'm in. Let me think about it tonight and pray with my wife." And then Tuesday morning I called him back and said, "Yeah, I think I'd like to go. I think this is what God would like me to do."
[time=2681] And I don't think there was a question in my mind where I needed to be.
[time=2685] So that day it was kind of a busy day. I had day of surgery and in between I'm trying to arrange getting a couple shots
[time=2694] and trying to put together a team and arrange how to get supplies we might need down there because there wasn't a whole lot of infrastructure.
[time=2704] It wasn't a whole lot of supplies down there we thought we might be able to use.
[time=2707] So thankfully the Lutheran Hospital on the orthopedic hospital, Lutheran put together 21 bags of supplies for us to take with us.
[time=2715] And we left Wednesday afternoon. It was another orthopedic surgeon from my group who called me, sprouted the moment also,
[time=2722] Tuesday afternoon and said, "Man, I know you're going. I'd love to go with you." And then two other nurses and then two staff from Water of Life went with us and it was really a God orchestrated group.
[time=2734] Every one of them in retrospect was necessary for us to be able to do what we accomplished while we were there.
[time=2740] And it was truly an amazing time.
[time=2743] I'll go through some pictures with you just to tell you.
[time=2746] I'll say two more things. One is that funny thing is that it's not really funny. It's amazing.
[time=2752] Two weeks ago, before we left, I had a friend come up with, known for a long time and said, "You know, I got laid on my heart to pray for you."
[time=2759] And he says, "Anything going on?" I said, "No, not that I'm aware of." And lo and behold, there was. If I'm not amazing, and I even forgotten about this with what we've gone through,
[time=2770] is Rick Rayburn actually shared a flight with me from where we were going, before we went to Detroit.
[time=2775] Then Detroit to Orlando, he was going somewhere else, but we sat and talked on a way to Detroit.
[time=2780] So that was, and you prayed with me there. So that was a pretty amazing event.
[time=2784] And we got down to Orlando. This is down at Missionary Flights International at Fort Pierce.
[time=2788] And they run flights to the Caribbean, and they've been going to Haiti for years.
[time=2793] And one of the awesome things is that they were able to increase the number of flights that went down, because Hendrix Motorsports, most of you know NASCAR fans would know that name.
[time=2801] And then at Doherty End Gibbs Motorsports also used, let them use their SOB 2000 planes to transport medical supplies
[time=2808] and medical staff to go down. So this is a picture of us getting there early in the morning to travel down to Haiti.
[time=2814] This is from the airplane, and this was a very common scene that we saw all over Port of Prince, as well as the again when we were there, is that the earthquakes didn't destroy every house,
[time=2825] but enough of them were damaged. Everybody was scared to live, to stay in their house.
[time=2829] So they essentially were living in tents outside, either in the road.
[time=2832] They would cordon off streets to live in, for now.
[time=2838] And this is a, this is a picture of the first day we were there operating.
[time=2842] The generator wasn't working very well. So we were using headlights to operate.
[time=2846] And we didn't, it was 90 some degrees in there. We didn't have gowns.
[time=2849] So we were doing a lot of wash outs, and this is just working on somebody's open fracture with my partner Ted.
[time=2856] This is a picture of the hospital we were working at in a car food named Aquini.
[time=2860] It wasn't really working very well before we got there, but there was enough medical staff who showed up.
[time=2865] We were able to get it functioning during the, during the 10 days we were there.
[time=2869] These tents are where patients are staying while they were after they're operated on, and someone in sanitary conditions, but that's the best we had.
[time=2877] These are just a couple of pictures you can see a little bit of the dust.
[time=2880] There was dust everywhere. We wore masks.
[time=2882] It was a 45 minute drive from where we lived during that time to where we operated at.
[time=2886] And so, a lot of times we were in the back of pickup trucks or other open vehicles.
[time=2890] And this just shows some of the devastation.
[time=2893] We had the opportunity, got worked it out, we stayed at Cascia Christian School, which is about a 20 acre compound in the Delmar area of Port-au-Prince.
[time=2903] And these were some of the kids who were staying there with their parents who lost their houses during the earthquake and who had worked for the Christian school.
[time=2912] And they lost family and relatives, pretty much everyone there.
[time=2916] In fact, one of the drivers who drove us around lost his entire family as he ran out of the house.
[time=2921] He was going to want to get it out, get out alive.
[time=2924] This is just a picture of one of the other orthopedic surgeons who had stayed at the compound with this.
[time=2927] This is coming back from work. It's dark outside.
[time=2931] Me and Malaria, he's from Fort Worth, Texas.
[time=2935] We worked with a lot of different surgeons while we were there.
[time=2939] Again, it's amazing.
[time=2941] Most of the injuries were caused by concrete that we took care of.
[time=2944] People trying to get out of the houses or the walls that surround a lot of the houses were falling over on top of the patients.
[time=2951] This is kind of typical of what we would do.
[time=2954] This is outside in the recovery area. The guy on the left in the blue hat is...
[time=2959] Actually, the guy on the far left is our translator.
[time=2962] The guy on the blue hat is from Spain who spoke broken in glacial.
[time=2965] And there's two there from the different Caribbean islands in the middle.
[time=2968] There's a French guy in the dark blue hat standing next to me.
[time=2972] So there were contingents from everywhere that we would work with.
[time=2975] And it was obviously communication could be difficult.
[time=2981] One of the things we noticed as the week as the 10 days kind of progressed is that when we first got there, there was no market stuff in the street.
[time=2989] But as the week progressed and as the 10 days progressed, more and more of the normal commerce came out where the people were venting and selling things on the streets.
[time=2997] And life kind of got back to normal in a sense.
[time=3001] This is a picture of one of the patients that we took care of towards the end.
[time=3005] She had a spinal block for her surgery and we fixed her femur.
[time=3009] She spoke only French Creole so she was singing to us in praying in French.
[time=3015] This is another kind of a picture of different people.
[time=3020] The ones on the left were from Loma Linda.
[time=3023] In the middle there in the green, the dark blue, they were from South Africa.
[time=3027] They traveled 80 hours to work there for 40 days and then go back.
[time=3030] And then another one from Nebraska, a friend of mine I've known for 15 years was there.
[time=3038] One of the interesting things also kind of way got to work things out is my wife was very worried about us when we went over because at that time we left, there was a lot of unrest and my wife was concerned about our safety as you would imagine.
[time=3053] So one of the things she prayed for is that somehow the military would be able to give us some protection and lo and behold, the answer to prayer was that part of the grounds of the Christian school, the southern command of the US military was using.
[time=3066] So we had a lot of homies, a lot of probably 2010s like this, and they let us use three of these for supplies and that was our time.
[time=3076] We made it kind of a Haitian time because when we drive to our hospital during the day,
[time=3082] you'd see these 10 cities.
[time=3085] They'd have one area where they would have a bunch of cell phones charging for a certain amount of gourds.
[time=3092] You could sit there and charge your cell phones so you'd see in the middle of the street a bunch of people charging cell phones and that was kind of our way to charge our cell phones at night and kind of debrief in a sense.
[time=3104] These are the folks that helped take us over there.
[time=3106] The people on the right is Leon and Joy, they're the missionaries, they're down there for water for life, they've been down there for about 25 years, helping drill wells in the past bottom in the southern Haiti, and the three guys on the left are all grandsons of the man who started it and helped get us over there and helped make our time there safe and productive
[time=3126] and transported us.
[time=3131] These are a couple of pictures after you got off the beaten trail just to kind of see if you got through the league and kind of going towards a past bottom which we visited while we were there, these are kind of typical areas of modes of transportation besides using tap taps and motorcycles.
[time=3147] This is the actual Kaskaya Christian school.
[time=3150] They made it a kind of a command center for a crisis response international cry and the guy sitting down in the tent is the guy who kind of ran the whole area and we sent people to eight or ten different places and it was over 200 medical staff by the time we left and they would kind of coordinate where people were going the next day.
[time=3170] There was a lot of difficulty communicating with different sections
[time=3176] so this was one way in which we were able to do that.
[time=3180] And here's just us in front of one of the hummers that were parked right outside our camper which was at Coleman tent.
[time=3186] This is a picture of the board.
[time=3188] This was kind of how our day always started is that the French would be our triage staff outside and they'd bring in a list of patients who showed up even by the time we left the two weeks we were still seeing people who had never been seeing care in the two weeks since the earthquake and they'd come in with open fractures and with injuries that needed treatment so every day the board would fill up with what you needed to do.
[time=3208] And that green sheet was my quarters for the ten days for most of it.
[time=3215] Just the green part, just the green part.
[time=3217] There were all those others or where other people were sleeping.
[time=3220] So that was my passport which we never left my side while we were there sitting on the map.
[time=3228] Amazing.
[time=3230] Incredible.
[time=3238] And they didn't have any razors, I see.
[time=3240] That's a nice beard look going there for some 20 years.
[time=3244] Seriously, there you go.
[time=3246] Matt's breaking out.
[time=3248] Something that you learned.
[time=3250] Again, we say it all the time that whenever we're willing to go, God's going to allow us to bless others but we're always going to get blessed as well.
[time=3259] I see things we wouldn't have seen and get to experience things we wouldn't have experienced.
[time=3263] What did God teach you, Matt, as he had you down there in Haiti for a while?
[time=3270] Well, I would say it was very difficult to concentrate or have much of a quiet time with all the noise
[time=3277] and with all the experiences both visually and with your auditory senses that you were taking in during the day.
[time=3282] So it was very difficult to think on a whole lot of other things other than just pray.
[time=3289] I did ask God just to give me a passage of Scripture.
[time=3291] I would try to get through the Psalms 143 through 146 every day just to kind of read something
[time=3298] but it was very difficult to kind of concentrate on much of anything because so many things were going through your mind and you didn't really sleep while you were there.
[time=3306] So it was very tiring towards the end of the day.
[time=3309] I think chapter 146 I believe was the one I kind of fell most on
[time=3315] and I may have you read that since I didn't do too well last time.
[time=3318] Let's let you all meet or read it.
[time=3320] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, O my soul.
[time=3324] I will praise the Lord all my life.
[time=3327] I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
[time=3330] Do not put your trust in princes and mortal men who cannot save.
[time=3334] When their spirit departs they return to the ground on that very day their plans come to nothing.
[time=3341] Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob whose hope is in the Lord his God.
[time=3347] The maker of heaven and earth, the sea and everything in them, the Lord who remains faithful forever.
[time=3354] He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry.
[time=3359] The Lord sets prisoners free.
[time=3361] The Lord gives sight to the blind. The Lord lifts up those who are bowed down.
[time=3366] The Lord loves the righteous.
[time=3368] The Lord watches over the alien and sustains the fatherless and the widow.
[time=3373] But he frustrates the ways of the wicked.
[time=3376] The Lord reigns forever.
[time=3378] Dear God, O Zion, for all generations praise the Lord.
[time=3383] [AMEN] Oh, hey, would you just bow with me just for a moment? We need to thank God for what he did not only in Matt's life,
[time=3392] but what he continues to do as others are there serving and representing him.
[time=3396] Father, we're thankful for our friend Matt, so grateful for Lisa and the girls and their willingness to trust you and have him go.
[time=3406] God, I'm thankful that not only were his gifts and talents used, but God, his heart for you and for others was able to be expressed as well.
[time=3414] And we thank you for the difference it made, physically and spiritually in the lives of those he touched.
[time=3421] And we're thankful, God, for the difference it made in his life.
[time=3424] As we sense, and as I know, his sensitivity to you and you at work in the world and the way in which you move in the lives that are so needy and desperate for you.
[time=3436] God, as I see his sensitivity to that heightened, I pray that our sensitivity would be heightened as well.
[time=3442] That whether it's in Haiti or across the street, whether it's in our cubicle at work or with a son or a daughter,
[time=3450] whether it's in the classroom at school or on the factory floor, God, please keep growing us to be a priesthood of people willing to go,
[time=3459] to step forward and serve and love and speak truth and use our gifts to make a difference for the kingdom.
[time=3467] Thank you for bringing Matt back. God, we pray for safety for others who will go in the days to come.
[time=3472] And we pray that in all of it, God, that you would be honored, that your truth would be lifted up and that people would be redeemed.
[time=3479] And everybody agreed and said, amen.
