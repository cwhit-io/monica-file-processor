[time=346] - Well, hello and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=351] It's good to have you with us again as part of our family, which is how we always refer to you.
[time=357] Those of you who watch, those of you who make up our broadcast audience, we see you as part of this family.
[time=364] And as part of our family, we want you to know about something that's starting today as you watch this on the 21st of February, Sunday, this marks the beginning of what we at Blackhawk call and have been calling for the last four or five years, the preparation.
[time=382] It's the six weeks leading up to the most significant day of all days, resurrection Sunday, and in these six weeks, we just make a commitment as a family to make a very big deal about these days leading up to Easter Sunday and all that it means and all that the resurrection has accomplished for us, all the blessings and all the privilege and all the hope that it has brought.
[time=408] We wanna make a big deal so we prepare for it and in the preparation we do three things.
[time=414] There is a daily scripture reading commitment that we make and we've passed out booklets with the daily reading opportunities to all of our people and that reading is available to you online at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=428] We think that's important to every single day over these next six weeks to fill and flood our minds, literally with the great truth about the resurrection and I hope you'll take us up on that and give yourself to the discipline of filling your heart and mind with God's word.
[time=445] Secondly, we make a commitment to fast.
[time=448] That's right, we're fasting and I know oftentimes when you hear the phrase fasting, you think of food and some of us are fasting food at different times of the day or different times of the week or certain food items, but fasting can also just move into the regular everyday disciplines of your life.
[time=467] It may have to do with television watching.
[time=469] It may have to do with the computer.
[time=472] It may have to do with any number of things that you're just willing to give up for a six week period and in the giving up of it and the sacrifice that that brings, you're reminded, and I'm reminded of the great sacrifice of our Lord.
[time=486] So we're reading God's word.
[time=488] We're fasting something significant in our lives and we're doing what we call here at Blackhawk.
[time=495] We're doing an alms offering, alms offerings.
[time=498] We're offerings taken back in Bible times, alms were given toward those in need.
[time=504] And so we have committed to over and above our regular giving at the end of every service each week, we're making an alms offering, and this year our alms offering is going toward the ministry in town called In As Much.
[time=517] And In As Much has been associated with Broadway Christian Church for years, and In As Much is a benevolent, kind, caring, need-meeting ministry that comes alongside the people of Fort Wayne in an incredible way.
[time=533] And we want to do what we can to contribute to the efforts of In As Much.
[time=538] And so our alms offering this year is going to that ministry.
[time=542] You can contribute to that by just sending a check-in with alms offering written in the memo portion.
[time=549] You can call our church office at the number here below to figure out different ways to make contributions to In As Much, but we want you to know about the preparation.
[time=558] Your part of our family and our family is preparing for this great, great celebration called Resurrection Sunday.
[time=566] Thank you for being a part of our family, and thank you for tuning in today.
[time=570] We're grateful for you.
[time=571] I hope you're encouraged as you watch the message today, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=576] [MUSIC - 62 seconds]
[time=644] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 84 seconds]
[time=737] And we cry holy, holy, holy [MUSIC]
[time=761] Is the land â™ª As always, it is a real privilege.
[time=768] And I mean that to be able to be here in these waters this morning.
[time=772] You see me here and you know immediately this is a chance, a privilege that we get each and every month to celebrate new life.
[time=780] God at work in real everyday people in amazing ways as He accomplishes and works out His redeeming, rescuing love.
[time=792] And I'm so looking forward to the encouragement I think God's going to bring to your heart as you hear from a young man this morning.
[time=800] Austin, come on in here.
[time=801] I want you to meet Austin Neal.
[time=803] Some of you may know Austin.
[time=804] Others of you may not.
[time=805] I'm really thankful.
[time=806] He's got some buddies with him.
[time=808] Luke Bone, Mitchell Whitman.
[time=810] His dad, Steve Hatch, was just up here.
[time=812] We prayed together.
[time=813] And as always, I just want you to listen.
[time=816] In this case, Austin shares with you what God has done in His life.
[time=821] He knows that you don't expect eloquence from Him.
[time=825] He knows that you'll be encouraged as you genuinely hear about what God has accomplished.
[time=832] And so Austin, come on over here, bud.
[time=834] And just share what you've got written there.
[time=836] And church, just be encouraged.
[time=839] Well, good morning.
[time=840] This water's warm this time.
[time=842] But my name is Austin Neal.
[time=846] Most of you are familiar with me.
[time=848] I've been part of this church body most of my life.
[time=851] Along with my family.
[time=852] My mom and dad, Kimberly and Dr. Steven Hatch.
[time=855] My two sisters, Maureen and Brittany.
[time=857] And my bros, AJ and Zachary.
[time=859] I've attended Black Hawk Christian School for all of 13 years and recently graduated here in Black Hawk in 2009 in a student at Bethel College.
[time=867] Like I just mentioned, I've been a part of Black Hawk most of my life.
[time=870] I grew up in an extreme Christian environment.
[time=873] Always feeling like I was being spoon fed the word.
[time=876] I never really knew what it meant to claim my very own faith.
[time=879] I've always been raised by single loving, hardworking mother.
[time=883] Growing up without a father figure in my life had always left a gaping hole in my heart.
[time=887] I didn't know what was missing.
[time=889] Neither was to substitute to fill it.
[time=892] For the times my dad was around, it was nothing but mental and physical abuse.
[time=896] Negativity is self-doubt, self-consciousness and fear.
[time=899] Fear from my heart and how I wish I would never want to be a failure of a father to my own kids like I experienced.
[time=906] I remember feeling like I could never amount to anything.
[time=909] That I wasn't good enough to even be a friend.
[time=911] A son of my parents and even a son of God.
[time=914] I must stick my Heavenly Father from my earthly father.
[time=917] I became very bitter and selfish as my years went on.
[time=920] I hated the world and everyone and everything in it.
[time=924] My grades started to drop dramatically in high school and I always relied on my teachers to pity me enough to give me a passing grade.
[time=932] I always just got by.
[time=934] Things started to get worse when my mom had decided to marry about six years ago.
[time=938] I was nowhere near ready to all of a sudden just give my home and life up for some guy and his son who annoyed the daylight side of me.
[time=945] But I love them now at the time.
[time=949] But I didn't pay the bills and I had no say in the matter.
[time=953] I started to sink into deep depression and I closed myself off from everyone who just wanted to love on me.
[time=959] I wasn't going to risk getting hurt again.
[time=962] So I started like every stubborn teen hanging out with the wrong group of guys.
[time=966] Always trying to fit in and I would do whatever I needed to do in order to do that.
[time=970] Just that.
[time=971] I became very confused on what life was really all about.
[time=974] By the beginning of my junior year of high school, I started experimenting with different kinds of drugs.
[time=978] My so-called friends gave me.
[time=980] I love them.
[time=982] They filled the empty hole in me.
[time=985] Or so I thought.
[time=987] As the years went on, I became more stubborn and ignorant.
[time=990] I started giving more serious about my choice of friends and popping more pills.
[time=994] I started to realize that they just left me emptier inside.
[time=997] But I didn't care.
[time=998] I took more and more.
[time=999] Soon all I would think care and think about was my drugs all day and every day.
[time=1004] I wouldn't leave the house until I was so high so I could try and enjoy my nights.
[time=1009] My addiction got to the point where I would take prescribed medication every day.
[time=1013] It was spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars a week on hard drugs that could have potentially killed me numerous times.
[time=1018] I kept this all a secret from my friends and family until about two months ago.
[time=1022] My parents have found out about my deadly addiction and immediately searched for help.
[time=1027] I've been an IOP, which is intensive, outpatient rehab, and have been sober since then.
[time=1032] I redidicated my life to Christ and sin and have felt his love and arms around me.
[time=1036] I found a new high now and it's Christ.
[time=1039] I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for the prayers and support of my family and friends.
[time=1044] Thank you to all who loved on me and showed me Christ's love.
[time=1047] He has blessed me with an amazing family who really loved me.
[time=1051] I've grown to love my new dad and brother to the ends of the earth.
[time=1055] Thanks to Christ, he gave me me and my brothers that special bond.
[time=1059] He also gave me a dad.
[time=1061] But I know I would get in trouble if I don't mention my two beautiful, humorous sisters.
[time=1066] Thanks for kicking me in the butt when I was out of line.
[time=1069] Mom and Dad, thank you so much for spending time on your knees and prayer for me every single morning.
[time=1074] God heard you and he answered.
[time=1076] I'm extremely pumped to continue my journey with God.
[time=1079] Let me switch the page here.
[time=1080] I'm extremely pumped to continue my journey with God and be a leader that he calls me and all of us men to be.
[time=1086] God calls all of us to be baptized as an act of obedience. He says be holy because I am holy.
[time=1091] I want all my brothers and sisters in Christ to know the final decision that I have chosen and understand that all of me belongs to God.
[time=1098] With God's help, I will rebuild relationships that I have lost and be like to those who were lost like I was.
[time=1103] To those of you who are on the fence of full and surrounding your life to our Creator, don't wait.
[time=1108] Now is the time to humbly get on your knees and seek forgiveness.
[time=1111] I promise you that God is here and you and is broken for you.
[time=1114] Sin takes you places you don't want to go and keeps you there longer than you want to stay.
[time=1119] But God promises his home for us, for those of us who keep the faith.
[time=1124] From here on out, I will strive for the moment when I will kneel before God and he will say to me, "Well done, my good and faithful servant." Thanks.
[time=1133] (Applause)
[time=1143] [AMEN] (Applause) Hey, would you join me in a word of prayer?
[time=1151] Father God, we are grateful for the words that you gave Austin to share with us as a family.
[time=1158] God, redeeming words that communicate your amazing patience and your redemptive work
[time=1165] and your willingness to save and heal and make new.
[time=1169] Father, we're grateful that you've done that with him and thankful God for the journey and the road that's ahead.
[time=1174] We pray for continued growth.
[time=1176] We pray God that he would continue to hold on tightly to you, his rock and his strong tower.
[time=1182] God, I pray that he would continue to take refuge in you and that his friends and family would continue to encourage and love him in that direction.
[time=1190] God, we're so grateful he's a part of this family and we celebrate today.
[time=1195] All that you have done and accomplished and all the people in the room agreed and said, amen.
[time=1200] All right, buddy. Let's do this.
[time=1203] He puts your hands right there on my hand and it's a real honor and I mean that, a real privilege.
[time=1211] As your pastor and friend, to baptize you today in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1217] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1235] [MUSIC - 246 seconds]
[time=1507] Leslie, come on up. I want to introduce you to Leslie before we get started this morning.
[time=1512] I'm so thankful that I get to be in this amazing job.
[time=1518] I hate to even call it a job, but I just get to live in this world and every week I hear a story.
[time=1523] Every week I get to meet somebody new and so many times with that new person comes a story of God's redeeming love
[time=1531] and him at work in their life and in our midst here and so I just ask everybody say hi to Leslie.
[time=1539] She is new to our family and I got to read her story this week and it wasn't really in the plan for the morning,
[time=1546] but you know me, I'm learning these days just to kind of let it roll and so I want you to hear her stories.
[time=1551] Is that okay? Awesome and I'm going to give you this mic there and I want you to listen to what God's doing
[time=1558] and be encouraged as Leslie tells you about what God's been up to in her life.
[time=1563] Good morning brothers and sisters in Christ. Good morning Leslie.
[time=1567] Morning. I may not know you, but I already love you.
[time=1571] This is a statement I have applied to my life since becoming involved in Black Hawk Celebrate Recovery.
[time=1578] You see through the years of searching for love in all the wrong places, love found me.
[time=1584] In mid-October 2009, while recovery from surgery and coming to terms with another failed relationship, I became depressed.
[time=1593] My mind kept reminding me in my past and my body was struggling to heal.
[time=1599] I had become physically, emotionally, and mentally exhausted.
[time=1604] As I lay on the couch, a voice came to me and said, "Get up and get your Bible out of the attic."
[time=1611] I questioned the thought and ignored it.
[time=1614] I grabbed a Bible, if I grabbed a Bible, most likely turned into a raging inferno.
[time=1621] After three days of this nagging voice telling me, "Get up and get your Bible out of the attic."
[time=1627] I finally listened.
[time=1629] I grabbed the ladder, climbed up into the attic to search through boxes to find this Bible.
[time=1635] Finally, I found it.
[time=1637] And brought it inside. I carried it to the basement and placed it beside me.
[time=1642] As I stared at this book, I thought to myself, "Okay, here it is, now what?" I started in the back under Subject Index and looked for scriptures about depression, then scriptures on abandonment.
[time=1656] Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.
[time=1659] I couldn't get enough of it.
[time=1661] I had to tell someone about this amazing feeling so I called Tammy, a loyal Christian friend of mine.
[time=1667] As I explained the story, she tells me, "God has knocked on your door, and you have let him in."
[time=1674] Why don't you try a 1045 service on Sunday at Blackhawk?
[time=1679] You will love Pastor Kelly Sermon.
[time=1682] So that following Sunday, I attended, and when I walked through the door, I took a look around and recognized a familiar face, Shelly.
[time=1690] She was standing beside the Celebrate Recovery Table.
[time=1693] I walked up to her and she had this look of amazement.
[time=1697] I didn't know you attended Blackhawk.
[time=1699] She said, "I replied I don't. Today is my first day coming here." She said, "As we stood there catching up on the past to the present, she tells me about Celebrate Recovery.
[time=1712] Please come. It's this Friday from 7 to 9. You are going to love it."
[time=1718] Shelly was right. I loved it.
[time=1721] I walked into a room of people of different racial backgrounds, different age groups, and they welcomed me with loving arms and tender words.
[time=1730] The love and fellowship that fills that room is profound.
[time=1734] The bond between all of them shows how God is working among the Celebrate Recovery group.
[time=1741] I must confess, my initial thought was recovery. I'm not an alcoholic or drug addict.
[time=1748] How can this group be for me?
[time=1751] What if I run into someone I recognize and they get the wrong impression?
[time=1756] I know I need recovery for more emotional past hurts.
[time=1760] Could this group really work for me?
[time=1762] As much as my thoughts tried to discourage me, God had bigger and better plans.
[time=1768] My first Friday at CR, I quickly figured out these are wandering souls that are being handed a well-structured, Christ-driven plan.
[time=1779] How fantastic is this?
[time=1782] During times of weakness, brokenness, or just spiritually doubtful, here's a group that will love you for you.
[time=1789] God had all his troubled children in mind when he gave birth to Celebrate Recovery.
[time=1795] I thank God for leading me to CR and my recovery is moving along very well.
[time=1801] I've been attending CR Sunday services, reading scripture and praying all the time.
[time=1809] Once again, instead of a voice, I started to have the strong desire to do service work.
[time=1815] I wanted to do the Lord's work and please him.
[time=1819] This feeling became very strong on a weekend and by Monday morning, I had an email from Shelly about a woman in need.
[time=1828] This was it.
[time=1829] My opportunity to work for the Lord.
[time=1831] The Lord called and I answered.
[time=1835] I am truly blessed that God searched me out, nagged me enough to give into him
[time=1841] and ask him for forgiveness of my sins, and he welcomed me into his family.
[time=1848] I now know that I control nothing.
[time=1851] It's all in God's hands and by God's plan.
[time=1855] I surrender it all to God.
[time=1857] My worries, fears, finances, career, children, my home, and the Lord provides.
[time=1866] So when he calls upon me, either to worship, service, or witness,
[time=1872] I'm going to do as my father tells me to.
[time=1875] So if you are a baby Christian or a lifelong loyal Christian and you feel distant from God, surrender it all to him.
[time=1887] Find time to serve us for the Lord and feel the love that will embrace you
[time=1893] and never release you.
[time=1895] Hebrews 13-5, God has said, "I will never fail you."
[time=1904] I will never forsake you.
[time=1908] [AMEN] (Applause) Good job.
[time=1912] Well done.
[time=1914] (Applause) Hey, I hope that encourages you deeply.
[time=1922] This young lady is being, I can call you a young lady.
[time=1925] Can I?
[time=1926] Okay, good.
[time=1927] This young lady is being made into a disciple, a follower of Jesus Christ.
[time=1932] I hope you're heard.
[time=1933] God is using the gathering.
[time=1935] God is using connecting in a smaller setting on a Friday night at 7 p.m.
[time=1941] and God is birthing in her this willingness to having gathered and having connected.
[time=1946] She's ready to go and serve and give and sacrifice.
[time=1950] And it couldn't be a better thing.
[time=1952] Praise God.
[time=1953] I want to ask you something.
[time=1955] I asked first hour and I think it was a huge encouragement to Leslie.
[time=1958] I know it was a huge encouragement to me.
[time=1960] And I think those who participated in this first hour meant it.
[time=1963] So I hope you will too.
[time=1964] If you would be, I mean this.
[time=1966] I know the whole room could do it.
[time=1967] But I just, I mean this.
[time=1969] If you'd be willing this week, three or four times, really, to pray for her.
[time=1975] To pray for her continued growth.
[time=1977] To pray for her as she continues to move away from the addiction of sin as it, as it revealed
[time=1983] itself in her life.
[time=1984] If you would pray for her in her heart and her family, would you just raise your hand?
[time=1989] Awesome.
[time=1990] I mean it now.
[time=1991] Write it down.
[time=1992] Thank you.
[time=1993] Write it down.
[time=1994] Right now, do something.
[time=1995] I don't want you to forget to pray for Leslie this week.
[time=1999] And as a family, which is what we are, we'll encourage her.
[time=2003] I think we'll bring great glory and honor to God.
[time=2006] And we'll keep moving forward.
[time=2008] Thank you, my friend.
[time=2009] Good job.
[time=2010] Give her a hand.
[time=2012] Hey, if you would, open your Bibles to Ephesians chapter four.
[time=2020] Thanks, Laura.
[time=2021] It's kind of like a pit stop here.
[time=2024] I'm getting new tires.
[time=2026] It's a little NASCAR humor for you.
[time=2031] Ephesians chapter four, I'm so looking forward to this.
[time=2034] I've loved Ephesians one, two, and three.
[time=2037] I've been telling you for weeks and weeks and weeks that we would come to this place where we would kind of pivot, if you will, in our study, the first three chapters talking about the truth of our salvation, these last three talking about the way in which we should live
[time=2052] in light of that salvation, all of which leads us to the life.
[time=2057] The God ordained, God supplied, God intended life that you and I get to live in relationship
[time=2065] with his son.
[time=2067] Even though I told you Ephesians four, I'm actually going to begin today in John 12.
[time=2071] I think you'll understand in just a moment.
[time=2073] Here we go.
[time=2074] John 12, 42, and 43.
[time=2076] Let me paint the picture here of what's going on.
[time=2079] Nevertheless it says in verse 42 of John 12, nevertheless many, even of the rulers, here
[time=2085] we are with Jesus and the Pharisees and the Sadducees and this context of what was going
[time=2093] on there religiously as he comes and begins to assert his leadership and his messiah-ship.
[time=2098] You all know, most of us know it caused a great deal of conflict and confusion with
[time=2104] some.
[time=2105] Nevertheless many, even of the rulers, the text says, believed in him.
[time=2112] But because of the Pharisees, they were not confessing him.
[time=2117] So they were beginning to believe in him that he was the Christ.
[time=2125] But because of the Pharisees, they were not confessing him.
[time=2129] Why?
[time=2131] For fear that they would be put out of the synagogue.
[time=2135] Amazing.
[time=2136] Huge verse right here, 43.
[time=2138] For they loved the approval of who?
[time=2142] For they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God.
[time=2146] Write it down.
[time=2147] It's one of the great detriments to discipleship.
[time=2151] It is one of the great dangers of this commitment.
[time=2155] Many of you in the room, including myself, have made to follow Jesus Christ.
[time=2160] It is a really scary spot and it's not at all what God intended when you and I begin to fear care more about the approval of men rather than the approval of who.
[time=2170] Say it again, God.
[time=2176] Stay with me.
[time=2177] I think you'll put all this together.
[time=2178] In chapter 9, John 9, 21 and 22, we pick it up in the middle of a quote from two parents
[time=2185] whose son had been healed and they knew good and well who had healed him.
[time=2191] But how he now sees we do not know or who opened his eyes we do not know.
[time=2197] Ask him, they said.
[time=2198] Ask him.
[time=2199] He is of age.
[time=2200] He will speak for himself.
[time=2202] His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews.
[time=2206] So the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed, there's that word, confessed him
[time=2212] to be Christ, that person was to be put out of the synagogue.
[time=2220] So what do we learn from these passages?
[time=2221] What we learn is this.
[time=2222] There were those who had experienced the blessing of Jesus and His healing but were hesitant.
[time=2231] Those who actually believed but would not come forward, if you will.
[time=2238] We see in these examples people who were very clear on what God had done, very clear on
[time=2245] what God had accomplished for them but unwilling to speak up and live differently.
[time=2253] Their blind son could now see but they didn't want to miss out on life in the club.
[time=2263] They didn't want to be too distinct.
[time=2268] They didn't want to be too counter-cultural.
[time=2271] They were about acceptance.
[time=2276] They love the acceptance of men rather than the acceptance of God.
[time=2278] They were about comfort.
[time=2281] They were about ease.
[time=2284] Sound familiar?
[time=2286] They were unwilling to stand up and be counted.
[time=2289] And there were those like that then and there are those like that when today now.
[time=2301] And Paul now moves in his letter to the Ephesians to chapters 4, 5, and 6 and the clear admonition
[time=2309] to live every day life in a way that is consistent with the reality of what God had done for
[time=2318] them, to live, to make choices, to hang on to principles and values.
[time=2325] In light of the position God had put them in.
[time=2329] Chapters 1, 2, and 3, what position had God put them in?
[time=2333] What position has God put you in as a fully surrendered follower of Christ?
[time=2339] Well just real quick, God had adopted them.
[time=2342] God had saved them, redeemed and empowered them.
[time=2346] God had permanently instilled His Spirit in them.
[time=2350] Those who were far off and disenfranchised were now brought near.
[time=2354] Spiritual blessings and privileges had been deposited in their hearts and lives.
[time=2359] They were now spiritually rich, wealthy and He simply implores them to live like it.
[time=2373] Write the check, go live in the midst of all the blessing that God has given you.
[time=2385] Reminds me of the true story, the account I heard years ago, I've shared it with you in years gone by, it's been a while, the true story of Hetty Green.
[time=2396] Hetty Green, true story died at the age of 85 in a cat infested garbage covered shack
[time=2405] where all heat and electricity had been cut off due to delinquent payments, wooden payer
[time=2411] bills, hadn't, for months and months and months they found out.
[time=2417] At the time of death she was malnourished, dehydrated and her adult son who lived with
[time=2425] her was suffering from mass infection in his leg from a wound she had refused to seek medical
[time=2431] attention for because of cost.
[time=2436] But here's the deal, in the hours following her death and the days that ensued they found
[time=2443] hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and
[time=2450] paper bags in her closet, three to four hundred thousand dollars in jewelry literally stuffed
[time=2460] in her mattress and stock certificates from various fortune 500 companies in her dresser
[time=2467] totaling $1.3 million.
[time=2473] If I remember right as I read the account it ended up being somewhere in the neighborhood of $2 million within 20 feet of where they found her body.
[time=2485] Just think about that for a second, go ahead.
[time=2491] Think about cat infested garbage covered, malnourished, dehydrated, son almost dead.
[time=2501] Just the hell of all that, just the dirt and the filth and the sickness and the disease
[time=2507] in two million dollars within 20 feet.
[time=2515] Physically, she had all the resources, blessings and privileges needed to live and to live well.
[time=2524] But instead, for whatever reason, maybe the most important sentence of the morning here.
[time=2529] You ready?
[time=2531] But for whatever reason, she never applied the resources she possessed and the result
[time=2538] was ugly, tragic, even deadly.
[time=2543] Just look at that phrase, she never applied the resources she possessed.
[time=2553] She had it.
[time=2556] It was right there, but she never used it.
[time=2563] Ephesians 4-1, my friends, Paul, as he transitions now to this second and last section of the
[time=2571] book dealing with the practice of this position that God has established says, "Therefore,
[time=2578] I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with
[time=2585] which you have been called, the calling with which you have been called, the position that God has put you in, the blessings, the resources, the hundreds of thousands of dollars stuffed
[time=2597] in your mattress, don't die malnourished.
[time=2606] Live it out, utilize it, apply the resources that God has given you."
[time=2614] I love one of those very first phrases.
[time=2617] Therefore, we've talked about that.
[time=2619] That refers back.
[time=2620] Wherever you see that, that refers back to all that we've just seen.
[time=2623] Therefore, I, the prisoner of the Lord, stop there.
[time=2626] The prisoner of the Lord.
[time=2629] When you study that phrase in the Greek, what you find out is there's a couple of translations, prisoner of the Lord, prisoner for the Lord.
[time=2637] Maybe the most accurate though, and the one I want you to hold on to this morning, the way it really reads is prisoner in the Lord, in curious.
[time=2645] Write that down.
[time=2646] In curious is the phrase that's used.
[time=2649] To be in a prisoner in the Lord, in curious means, in under the sphere of the Lord.
[time=2658] In the Lord, under the sphere of the Lord, and the use of in curious is really important.
[time=2665] The use of in the Lord takes us back to Ephesians 2.1.
[time=2669] This is so cool how it just, we just keep seeing how He sets us up for 4, 5, and 6.
[time=2675] Go back to 2.1, if you would.
[time=2678] Go to Ephesians, turn there real quick, go back to Ephesians 2.1, where back here, toward
[time=2685] the beginning of our study, if you'll remember, we came to that one Sunday where we taught this and it says, and you were dead in, there's in, you were dead in your trespasses and sins,
[time=2698] in which you formerly walked according to the course of this, what, world?
[time=2707] They used to be, as did Paul, in trespasses and sin, a condition that left them dead,
[time=2714] and they were dead because they were, as we learned in 2.1, they were dead because they were in, in Aeon.
[time=2722] Remember I taught you about Aeon, kata Aeon, walking according to the course of this world.
[time=2728] They used to be in Aeon, walking according to the course of this world.
[time=2732] I told you then that meant to be controlled, influenced, and dominated by.
[time=2739] And they used to be in Aeon, controlled and influenced and dominated by the world.
[time=2744] Now Paul says not anymore.
[time=2748] Our sphere has changed, we're not in Aeon, we're in curious.
[time=2754] He influences everything I do and every part of my life, chapters 4, 5, and 6, here it comes and it should be the same with you.
[time=2762] Our sphere of influence, control and dominance has changed, faith and the blessings that
[time=2769] come with faith should now get lived out.
[time=2772] I, the prisoner in the Lord, Paul says, it's a great truth.
[time=2781] One more thing I want you to see there, just a side note as it relates to the beginning of 4-1, not only is he in curious, not only is he in Christ, did you catch the life circumstance
[time=2794] within which Paul says he's in curious in the sphere of the Lord.
[time=2801] Therefore I, the what?
[time=2804] The prisoner, did you see that?
[time=2808] The prisoner of the Lord.
[time=2811] He's a prisoner, he's imploring them to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which they have been called.
[time=2818] My friends, don't miss this, he's incarcerated, he's in prison, he's behind bars, he's suffering
[time=2825] mistreatment, he's being held against his will and we're all really quick and I understand
[time=2831] it so am I, we're all really quick to say amen to the letting the reign of Christ rule in our lives and we're all real quick to say amen, we should project that as our message but what if like Paul we were in chains for the sake of the gospel?
[time=2848] Would that be your message then?
[time=2851] You say well it's kind of a tough question because we're not like ever going to be in chains, Kelly, all right how about the chains, how about the chains of cancer?
[time=2863] What's your message then?
[time=2865] How about the chains of job loss?
[time=2869] How's your message?
[time=2870] How about the chains of marital pain and failure?
[time=2873] The chains of mistreatment, the chains of suffering, the chains of past mistakes, here's
[time=2880] a great question, do you allow the negative realities of your life to negate the reign
[time=2886] and rule, do you allow the negative realities of your life to negate incurios?
[time=2895] You living in the sphere and not only living in that but allowing that to be your message to negate the reign and rule of Christ, the influence and control of Christ in your everyday life?
[time=2908] Somebody said at one time to me are you going to follow Jesus period or with a comma?
[time=2913] I thought that was well said.
[time=2917] Paul's about to say in these next three chapters don't let that happen, leave the comma out, follow him, be who he's called you to be, apply the resources that he has deposited
[time=2927] in your account.
[time=2932] One more thing along just I think general lines of introduction here as we start out.
[time=2936] It's important to note, it's important to note not just what Paul is saying to us here
[time=2943] and then this is really good but how he is saying this to you.
[time=2950] He says in 4-1, he says, "Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you."
[time=2957] If you have your Bible open this morning, I hope you do.
[time=2959] If you've got your Bible open, mine says when I come to Ephesians 4-1, it says, "Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you." What's a different word that you have in your translation?
[time=2970] Just say it out loud.
[time=2972] Urge, what else?
[time=2974] Seach, that's the good old version there, I love that, reminds me of my grandpa, it's
[time=2981] a good word, it's a great translation, I beseech you, Paul says, "I implore you, I urge you."
[time=2994] When you look up the word, there's another word we can throw in there, I beg you.
[time=3000] And I'm not just making emphasis here and getting loud for dramatic effect, it's what the word means.
[time=3007] It's as if he's saying to you, it's as if he's saying to me and he was saying it to these people, he was saying, "I'm begging you, I'm urging you, I am beseeching you."
[time=3019] There were several Greek words that could have been used, that would have communicated general encouragement or a hopeful, "Hey, please consider this."
[time=3031] But he uses the word paracalao, P-A-R-A-K-A-L-E-O, paracalao, to urge strongly, to plead,
[time=3041] it represents intense begging.
[time=3044] And I want to just make sure that we understand this, Connor Bland, come here, real quick,
[time=3052] I want to have you help me with this, you can leave your Bible, spiritual guy you, I know you walk around with it all the time.
[time=3060] Everybody say hi to Connor.
[time=3062] So here's the deal, I know we'll run out of time, so I'm going to be quick, but listen, this is important.
[time=3066] Paul, as he comes alongside his brothers, Paul, as he comes alongside those he cares
[time=3073] about, and I want you to think about those that you care about, I'm thinking about those I care about.
[time=3079] I care about Connor, hey buddy, here's what we sometimes, here's what we too often times
[time=3086] do when it comes to this idea of paracalao.
[time=3090] Too many times, you and I don't paracalao.
[time=3095] Too many times when we know, not because of gossip or what someone's told us, but because of a relationship that we have, I might know that there's things going on in Connor's heart that aren't good.
[time=3106] I might know that Connor's thinking about going down a road, he shouldn't go down.
[time=3109] I don't think any of this is true by the way.
[time=3112] You doing okay?
[time=3112] All right, good.
[time=3114] There might be things going on that I just know in my spirit, and I know because of the conversations we've had, I just know that it's not what God would have, and I'm not being judgmental, I'm being loving, and it concerns me, but what I do, what we do too many times
[time=3131] is we kind of do this, how's it going?
[time=3135] It's good?
[time=3136] Yeah.
[time=3137] Awesome.
[time=3138] See you.
[time=3140] And then sometimes we really get into it, you know, we think we're stretching ourselves and we go, hey, you really doing all right?
[time=3145] Yeah.
[time=3146] You sure?
[time=3147] Yeah.
[time=3148] Good.
[time=3149] And I just want you to see this.
[time=3152] That is not paracalao.
[time=3156] This is paracalao.
[time=3159] It means to look someone in the eye because you love them and to have enough guts because you care and say, hey, don't do that.
[time=3170] Sorry.
[time=3172] Please, I am begging you because I love you.
[time=3181] Please, please don't do that.
[time=3183] Are you guys catching this?
[time=3185] All right, go.
[time=3191] You we don't, we just, I'll speak for you on this one and I'll speak for me.
[time=3200] We don't do that.
[time=3203] Why don't you do that?
[time=3206] Why wouldn't you do that with your son or daughter?
[time=3209] Why wouldn't you do that with your friend?
[time=3214] Why wouldn't you get on your knees and beg them to do what's right and then offer all the help and energy and support they might need to do it.
[time=3227] Paul, same guy, same word, Acts 26, 3, he pleads, he paracalatos with King Agrippa to listen
[time=3236] to his testimony because he wants King Agrippa to be saved.
[time=3241] Paul, same guy, same word, paracalatos, 2 Corinthians 2, 8, Paul pleads, he begs, he urges strongly the Corinthians to remember and reembrace and reaffirm their love for
[time=3252] a repentant brother who had been in sin.
[time=3254] Same guy, same word, Galatians 4, 12, paracalatos, Paul pleads with the Galatians to not fall
[time=3260] back into legalism but to stand in the freedom and liberty of the gospel.
[time=3266] Paul's always urging, he's always pleading, always begging, the saved and the unsaved.
[time=3275] He's even willing with those far from God to beg them and to urge them and to beseech
[time=3283] them.
[time=3284] You know why?
[time=3289] I think the reason why and I'd love to hear from you on this.
[time=3294] I said it last week and many of you took me up on it.
[time=3297] I was so encouraged.
[time=3298] I said, "Email me.
[time=3301] Why is the church in North Korea, a church that's being murdered, tortured and persecuted and why is that church growing and why is our church in America shrinking?"
[time=3312] There were some amazing insights.
[time=3315] Why don't we paracalato?
[time=3319] Why don't you get on your knees with those that you love?
[time=3321] Why don't you hold people by the collar and lovingly look them in the eye and urge them to do what's right?
[time=3327] Why are you so afraid to do that?
[time=3332] Think about it.
[time=3334] Keep me an email, I mean it.
[time=3337] I'll tell you this, for Paul, the stakes were sky high.
[time=3346] Everything was at stake.
[time=3347] In his heart and mind, as he looked at this stuff, the stakes were high and I'm not so
[time=3353] sure the stakes are so high for you and I.
[time=3356] I'm not sure we see it that way.
[time=3360] He says to these folks, as he begins these next three chapters, "I am begging you to listen."
[time=3368] And I love you all.
[time=3369] I'm so thankful we get to do this and I want to just stand here and I want to grab every one of you by the collar.
[time=3375] Make a line right now.
[time=3377] I want to beg you.
[time=3379] I am begging you.
[time=3381] I am pleading with you.
[time=3384] Please listen.
[time=3386] And please, don't die in a cat infested garbage covered shack with your bills not paid and
[time=3396] all this, all this in your mattress.
[time=3400] Let's stand.
[time=3402] Father in heaven, we are grateful for your truth and we are so thankful to be a part of
[time=3408] the family of God, so blessed God to be a part of your kingdom moving forward and so thankful
[time=3416] God to be part of this family here at Blackhawk and as you continue to grow us, God, I pray
[time=3422] that we would cooperate.
[time=3424] God as we move into this next section about the way we live our lives, what else could
[time=3430] be more important, God, than us truthfully and accurately and authentically and meaningfully
[time=3437] living out all that you've instilled in us.
[time=3441] Oh, God, we pray you'd help us with that.
[time=3444] We love you, Father.
[time=3445] We're thankful for you at work and the lives of people like Leslie.
[time=3448] So thankful for the gals who are going and giving themselves to those in the clubs, God, we are grateful today for the gathering that we get to experience, the connecting that goes on in smaller settings where growth and maturity gets furthered in this amazing privilege that
[time=3465] you give us to go into the workplace tomorrow, across the street tonight, across the world next week.
[time=3471] Whatever it works out, God, we get to be a priesthood that goes and makes a difference
[time=3477] with your help.
[time=3478] We love you for that.
[time=3479] Thank you for letting us be a part of that and all the people in the room agreed and said, amen.
[time=3501] [AMEN]
