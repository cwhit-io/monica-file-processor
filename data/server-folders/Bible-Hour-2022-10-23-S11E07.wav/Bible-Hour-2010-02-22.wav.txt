[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] If I were to ask you this question, I wonder what your answer would be.
[time=39] If I were to ask you what has been over the hundreds and hundreds of years that the church has been in existence, what has been its greatest enemy?
[time=50] If I were to ask you over all the years that the church, the bride of Christ has been in existence, what has been the one thing that has done the most damage, what is the one thing that's been most destructive when it comes to the church and its ability to be the redemptive force, the grace-giving force, the hope-bringing force that God designed it to be.
[time=75] If I were to ask you what's the one thing that has gotten in the way more than any other thing in all of time and all of history, what would you say?
[time=85] You know I've talked to many people about it in the last few weeks and immediately folks think about immorality, folks think about doctrinal differences.
[time=96] I mean the list begins to just flow out of people and yet the one thing that has been most destructive seldom comes up and the fact of the matter is, statistically we can prove it, this isn't subjective opinion, objectively the one thing that has destroyed the church the most in all of its years is Christians.
[time=117] Christians, believers, fighting, Christians and believers, Christ followers supposedly who have been factious and divisive.
[time=129] The one thing that has destroyed the church for years and years and years is disunity and the Bible in powerful ways and in our message today from Ephesians 4 speaks to this very issue, it was at the top of Paul's list when he turns the corner and Ephesians 4 and begins to list out those things that we must live out in order to be consistent with all that God has done for us in chapters one, two and three and the first thing on his list is unity.
[time=160] And I hope if you're part of a church watching this broadcast today, I hope if you're part of the Blackhawk family watching this broadcast today, I hope if you're watching today wondering what the church is really supposed to look like, how it's really supposed to function and treat each other, I hope today your heart will be encouraged.
[time=179] I hope you'll be reminded of the great truth God's word gives us as it relates to how we are in the church to treat and relate to each other.
[time=188] It is so important.
[time=190] It allows the church to be effective or it destroys a church's effectiveness, unity, unity in the body of Christ.
[time=198] I hope today your heart will be encouraged.
[time=200] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=202] As always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=204] And if there's anything we can ever do for you-- and I mean this, anything-- please don't hesitate to give us a call.
[time=210] Shoot me an email, so thankful that you're part of the Black hawk family.
[time=215] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
[time=238] praise the Lord.
[time=248] It is good to praise the Lord, amen.
[time=252] [AMEN]
[time=252] [APPLAUSE]
[time=259] Let's keep praising him.
[time=260] Sound wonderful church.
[time=262] We're going to sing about how lovely his dwelling place is, better as one day in his court.
[time=267] Here we go.
[time=268] How lovely is your dwelling place on Lord Almighty,
[time=280] for my soul lost and even thanks for him?
[time=292] For him, my heart is satisfied, within your presence,
[time=303] by sleeping near the shadow of your ring.
[time=311] Better as one day in your courts,
[time=318] better as one day in your house, better as one day in your courts, and thousands elsewhere, better as one day in your courts,
[time=329] better as one day in your house, better as one day in your courts,
[time=335] and thousands elsewhere, and thousands elsewhere.
[time=348] [MUSIC - "POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE"]
[time=378] See, to see your beauty, to find you in the place
[time=388] your glory drowns.
[time=396] Better as one day in your courts, better as one day in your house, better as one day in your courts, and thousands elsewhere,
[time=407] better as one day in your courts, better as one day in your house,
[time=413] better as one day in your courts, and thousands elsewhere.
[time=420] My heart and flesh cry out for you, the living God,
[time=426] your spirit's water to my soul.
[time=431] I say, still, I say, come once again to me, I will draw near to you.
[time=440] I will draw near to you.
[time=461] [MUSIC - "POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE"]
[time=491] And thousands elsewhere, better as one day in your courts,
[time=497] better as one day in your house, better as one day in your courts,
[time=503] and thousands elsewhere, better as one day, better as one day,
[time=513] better than thousands elsewhere, and thousands elsewhere.
[time=519] [MUSIC - "POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE"]
[time=522] [APPLAUSE]
[time=539] Sound wonderful.
[time=540] It truly is a privilege to come before our Father, to dwell with Him, to be intimate with Him.
[time=550] [MUSIC - "POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE"]
[time=569] [MUSIC - "POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE"] There's an anthem ringing out.
[time=582] You can hear it clear and loud, coming from the hearts of men,
[time=591] echoing the great I am.
[time=595] [MUSIC - "POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE"] So we join today, we sing, "Alleluia."
[time=612] Praise your name and glorify, we sing, "Alleluia."
[time=622] Lift our voices to the sky.
[time=627] There's a song that never dies.
[time=632] It lives within a heart that cries, out from mercy
[time=638] on the streets.
[time=641] It's a cry of love and harmony.
[time=646] [MUSIC - "POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE"]
[time=654] And so we join today, we sing, "Alleluia."
[time=663] Praise your name and glorify, we sing, "Alleluia."
[time=672] Lift our voices to the sky.
[time=678] Men had praise you through the ages of followers,
[time=687] who have gone before us.
[time=689] So we stand before you, and we lift our voices all together.
[time=696] We join the chorus.
[time=700] We sing, "Alleluia." Praise your name and glorify, we sing, "Alleluia."
[time=714] Lift our voices to the sky.
[time=719] We sing, "Alleluia." Praise your name and glorify.
[time=729] We sing, "Alleluia." Lift our voices to the sky.
[time=736] Men had praise you through the ages of followers, who have gone before us.
[time=795] You know, in our busy, fast-paced lives, with all the opportunities and all the events
[time=818] of life, there is one thing that we've gotten really good at.
[time=823] Reparation, getting ready.
[time=827] Take Kristen, for example, guess what she's getting ready for?
[time=831] And as most of you know, there's a lot of preparing that goes into having a baby.
[time=835] I mean, when you think about it, there's a lot to do.
[time=837] They've been going to all their monthly appointments with their ultrasounds and testing.
[time=841] They've been working hard on the weekends to make sure the room is ready for when the baby shows up.
[time=846] They've been scouring all the stores, getting all the baby equipment, the stroller, and the crib, and the car seat, and the onesies, they have been getting ready.
[time=855] And we're ready.
[time=858] This is my friend Wayne.
[time=860] He's been doing a lot of hard work around here, and with a great heart, I might add,
[time=866] for a whole lot of years.
[time=868] Guess what he's getting ready for?
[time=870] You guessed it, retirement.
[time=873] So Wayne, how you getting ready?
[time=875] And we look for some cool shirts like this and say it as much money as I can.
[time=882] You know, getting ready is important.
[time=883] Just ask Linda.
[time=886] She likes to run.
[time=887] I mean, like, really run, like a long way and early.
[time=892] Before most of you have even thought about getting up in the morning.
[time=896] So, Linda, what do you do to prepare for the morning run?
[time=901] I think about it the night before, I put my clothes out.
[time=906] I think about what I eat, where I'm going to go.
[time=910] I check the weather to see how cold it is, how I should dress.
[time=916] I think about taking my cell phone and my pepper spray, and I always wear my headlight
[time=923] because it's dark outside.
[time=926] Hey, you know what, if it's important, we get ready for it.
[time=930] And is there anything more important to a teenager than getting ready for a driving test?
[time=936] This my friend Damon, he's getting ready for a driving test.
[time=940] You going to pass that thing?
[time=941] I hope so.
[time=942] You've been getting ready for it?
[time=944] A lot.
[time=945] Studying?
[time=945] Yep.
[time=946] Yeah, when are you studying?
[time=947] Before school, during study hall, after school, at home at night, during church.
[time=954] During church?
[time=955] What part of church?
[time=957] This sermon.
[time=959] You think you're funny, don't you?
[time=960] Sorry.
[time=961] I hope you fail a thing.
[time=962] All of it's important.
[time=965] But none of it is as important as the one single event that changed all of human history.
[time=970] And with that day, Resurrection Sunday coming soon, how about all of us that call Black Hawk home do some getting ready?
[time=978] We call it the preparation.
[time=981] And over the six weeks leading up to Easter Sunday morning, I want to ask every one of you to join in this preparation with us.
[time=989] It may stretch you a little.
[time=991] It may require some sacrifice.
[time=993] It may require some extra effort, but we think it's worth it.
[time=997] Remember, if it's important enough, you get ready for it.
[time=1001] Let's do some preparing together.
[time=1016] It was just before the Passover feast.
[time=1019] Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father.
[time=1023] Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love.
[time=1029] The evening meal was being served and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus.
[time=1036] Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God.
[time=1045] So he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
[time=1050] After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
[time=1059] He came to Simon Peter who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"
[time=1065] Jesus replied, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.
[time=1072] No," said Peter, "You shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me." Then Lord, Simon Peter replied, "Not just my feet, but my hands and my head as well."
[time=1086] Jesus answered, "A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet.
[time=1091] His whole body is clean, and you are clean, though not every one of you,
[time=1097] for he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean."
[time=1103] When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place, "Do you understand what I have done for you?" He asked them, "You call me teacher and Lord, and rightly so, for that is what I am.
[time=1117] Now that I, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet.
[time=1124] I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.
[time=1128] I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than
[time=1135] the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them."
[time=1151] Thanks, Clay and Jan. Clay read from our first, thank you, Flora. Clay read from our first card.
[time=1157] Again, if you've got this, I hope you'll follow along. He read from Sunday's reading. The packets divided up into different categories, this first week of readings under the heading of
[time=1168] service and the basin and the picture being the symbol of that. I can't tell you how many folks, really. How many people have over the years said to me, "I never really read the Bible every day. I never had it as a discipline in my life." And the preparation and those cards were
[time=1185] what God used to instill in me a desire and a hunger to do that even more so. So I hope you'll
[time=1191] get a packet of cards, young people, old people, moms and dads, every one of you. Grab a packet and give yourself inundate and surround your heart and mind with the great truth about this
[time=1202] event and we'll do that together. And I think God will honor our efforts. Well, last week we
[time=1209] came to a really significant juncture in our study of the book of Ephesians. It was really
[time=1215] important. I hope you'll open your Bibles this morning if you brought one to Ephesians chapter four. Last week we came to what is really the second half of this book and the second half
[time=1226] of our series. We've entitled the series The Truth, The Way and the Life and it's significant that you and I would be reminded of that series title today because we come to the pivot point really
[time=1237] in the series. The first three chapters of Ephesians have in a very powerful clear way shown us the
[time=1243] truth about our salvation, the truth about what God has done, the truth about the blessings that
[time=1249] He has bestowed in and on and around you who have come to trust and know His Son. We come to chapter
[time=1257] four now and four, five, and six will teach us and it will engage us, I hope, in a meaningful discussion about the way we are to live, the way we are to function, the way we are to value,
[time=1269] the principles that we're to not only hold on to but implement in our lives because of all that He
[time=1276] has accomplished leading us to the life, leading us to the life He intended us to live. Last week
[time=1283] we came to chapter four, verse one and we talked about the great tragedy that exists. We talked about
[time=1292] the horror of living life in a way that doesn't apply the resources that God has provided. I told
[time=1306] you about Hetty Green, true story, 85-year-old woman found dead in her home, cat infested, garbage
[time=1313] infested, she was malnourished, she was dehydrated, she had a son that lived with her with a massive
[time=1319] infection, he was almost dead because of the infection, she wouldn't provide medical care because of the cost, the electricity had been turned off, she hadn't paid her bills, the heat had been turned off, she hadn't paid her bills and yet they found in her closet you'll remember hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash in brown paper grocery bags, three to four hundred
[time=1340] thousand dollars in jewelry literally stuffed in her mattress and 1.2 million dollars in stock
[time=1346] certificates in her top drawer, almost two million dollars, 20 feet from where she died.
[time=1352] And there will take away from that story from last week just to catch you up on that. There will
[time=1359] take away from that is, oh my goodness, why would she not apply the resources that God had given?
[time=1368] Why would she not write the check in essence? Why wouldn't she live out all that had somehow been
[time=1376] provided? And you and I don't want to be, Paul didn't want the church at Ephesus to be and you
[time=1383] and I don't want to be people who don't live out, who don't apply the resources that God has
[time=1391] deposited in your account in mind, amen? And so we see Paul feeling, writing, speaking passionately
[time=1399] about this in 4-1, therefore, Ephesians 4-1, therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you,
[time=1406] implore you, I beseech you, I urge you, I beg you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which
[time=1415] you have been called. We left off right there, last week I was explaining to you and trying to illustrate to you this idea of imploring and begging, Paul was begging, he was imploring the
[time=1427] Ephesians, he was imploring them because he loved them. It's what you do with people who you love
[time=1434] and he was willing because he loved them to beg them toward this spiritual eternal stakes were so
[time=1442] high, he loved them so deeply and what he's begging them to do, we didn't quite, we didn't quite get
[time=1449] there last week but we will today, in fact right now, I want to read it to you, would you in honor of God's word stand and allow me the privilege of reading to you what Paul begs them to do, the beginning
[time=1462] of what Paul is begging them to do, Ephesians 4, verses 1-3, therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord,
[time=1469] implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called,
[time=1476] with all humility and gentleness, with patience showing tolerance for one another in love,
[time=1483] being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
[time=1491] Father God, Paul's begging is, Paul's begging is my prayer as a shepherd and a pastor and a
[time=1503] leader to this amazing family that you have given us. God, I pray and I hope these words and these
[time=1510] truths for this family and as we take time this morning to, with your help, explain this begging
[time=1517] to explain these truths. Oh God, would you guard my mouth from error? God, would you open hearts
[time=1523] that need to be opened? God, would you remind us and would you teach us and would you allow us to
[time=1529] make this, this turn? May we, having seen all that you have done. Oh God, may we live like it.
[time=1537] We beg you this morning. We beseech thee. We implore you, God, to do all that you need to do
[time=1547] in order to teach us the things that we need to know in your son's name we pray. Amen. Amen?
[time=1555] And you can be seated. So what was Paul begging them to do? I've been looking forward to diving
[time=1561] into this. What Paul begged them to do was walk worthy, I know you saw it there in the text, to walk
[time=1568] worthy of their calling. To walk worthy, I implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with
[time=1577] which you have been called. Then this is an incredibly interesting and I think very important
[time=1583] word for us to look at. When I say to you, hey, Paul's begging that you would walk worthy,
[time=1589] that the way in which you lead your life would be worthy of the calling with which you have been called. I don't know, what do you think? I mean, don't raise your hand and don't blurt it out this morning, but I want you to think about it. He says to you, he says to me, walk in a manner
[time=1605] everyday life, walking, walk in a manner that's worthy of the calling with which you have been
[time=1611] called, what kinds of things come to your mind. It's an amazing word that he uses here. The word is
[time=1617] axios. You can write it down, A-X-I-O-S. That's the word for worthy. In the Greek it means this,
[time=1623] it means the balancing of the scales. That which is on one side of the scale is balanced by that
[time=1631] which is on the other. It is really a very simple but profound concept. And I love the usage of
[time=1638] the word because by virtue of its definition it brings us right back to the outline of the book.
[time=1643] It's a word that had to do with measurements and scales. And what he's saying is this, hey, what's on the one side of the scale? Chapters one, two, and three. The fact that you were chosen,
[time=1657] the fact that you were adopted, the fact that you were saved and redeemed and forgiven and
[time=1663] filled and sealed with the Spirit of God. The fact that you've been brought into the family of God.
[time=1669] The fact that you now have hope. What's on the one side of the scale, chapters one, two, and three,
[time=1675] he says, on the other side of the scale, have the application of the resources you've been given,
[time=1684] have the application of that balance out the scale. Make sense? Not your heads, yes, no? It's a really
[time=1692] basic concept and yet too many times in the Ephesian church and too many times in our church,
[time=1700] the scale isn't balanced. And you got all this going on over here and what's going on over here
[time=1707] isn't balancing it out. It's hurting it. It's depriving it. It's making a mockery of it.
[time=1717] He begs them. And he begs you and I to walk in a manner that's worthy, that's consistent.
[time=1726] With the calling, with which you have been called. You might think it kind of silly or
[time=1737] elementary, but it's kind of how I think. Sorry. I've heard it said before and it just connected
[time=1743] with me and I think this is, while understating it tremendously, I think it's just a good illustration.
[time=1748] If the regardless of my personal political bent, all right, and others even may not feel this way,
[time=1755] but regardless of my political bent, if the White House called our office this next week,
[time=1763] said, "Hey, we saw this really cool video on your website with your pastor."
[time=1771] And Mr. Obama was really impressed and he'd like him to come and visit this Wednesday for lunch.
[time=1776] You know what? I'd go. I'd go. And because of the office and because of all that it represents,
[time=1785] because of whatever opportunity it might bring, I would go. That call comes. I'd go. And here's the
[time=1792] deal. Honestly, most of you know me. I don't get too uptight about dress or appearance, but I would shave.
[time=1801] And I wouldn't wear cut-off cotton shorts and flip-lops at an old t-shirt. I'd try to look nice.
[time=1808] I'd try to go worthy of the calling with which I had been called. You have been called.
[time=1819] And it's a much, it's a much bigger call than the White House. And he says to you and me,
[time=1828] "Hey, called ones, walk worthy. Have, have, be on the one side that which is equal and
[time=1837] commensurate to that which is on the other." Does that make sense? Yes, no? It's good, good truth.
[time=1844] It really is. And when I watch this and the first, I know as I read that and as I begin to understand
[time=1850] that, the first thing that pops into my mind is, "Okay, here we go. Four, five, and six. Okay, what are the qualities? What are the issues that need to be addressed for my walk to be
[time=1861] worthy?" And the first quality of a worthy walk that Paul led by the Spirit of God addresses is
[time=1868] chapter four, verses two to three. You can read it for yourself. Let's do it right here. He says,
[time=1874] "Here we go with all humility and gentleness with patience showing tolerance for one another
[time=1882] in love being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit, the unity of the body of Christ
[time=1890] in peace." This is really, really astounding. It's really significant that you understand
[time=1897] and track with what just happened in this study.
[time=1905] He's about to start unfolding in four, five, and six. You've been hearing me say it for weeks.
[time=1913] He's about to start unfolding the sum total of Christian living. I mean, he's about to get
[time=1920] right down to it and start to communicate to you and to me the things that are really important
[time=1927] for our walk to match with our calling. I mean, he's about to unfold some really important bullet
[time=1935] points. Four, five, and six are just fraught with some of the stuff that really, really comprises the
[time=1943] essence of living in our life as believers and followers of his son. They needed to know he had
[time=1950] three chapters here and they needed to know the biggies. I mean, it was important for them to get
[time=1956] me for him to get right down to it. And does he start with, is the bullet point that he starts with
[time=1962] doctrine? No, he gets to that because that's huge. Is the bullet point that he begins this
[time=1972] with? Is it family? Is it purity and immorality? No, it doesn't start there. He gets to that.
[time=1984] Does he begin with the corporate gathering? Does he begin with spiritual gifts? No. No, he doesn't.
[time=1990] It doesn't start there. He'll get to that, but that's not where he begins. Does he deal with the
[time=1996] tongue and the issues of self-control? No, he doesn't start there. Where he starts as he unfolds
[time=2004] some total of our Christian living is he starts with how you treat me and how I treat you
[time=2013] and how you treat him and how this body of believers functions in relationship with each other. He begins
[time=2024] with the topic of unity. And do you understand? Some of you may, others of you may not. Do you
[time=2033] understand that the great enemy of the church, for hundreds of years, do you understand that what
[time=2043] has diminished and, and, and, and detracted from and destroyed too many times in too many places,
[time=2051] the ministry of the local church is, is Christians who refuse to humble themselves and get along
[time=2061] and be gracious and kind. And he knew that. God certainly knew that.
[time=2070] And through the inspired pen of Paul, he begins with the issue of unity. All right, here we go.
[time=2079] Let's jump in. There's about four, four phrases that you've just got to understand as we talk
[time=2085] this morning about this first step toward living out our faith. He says, with all verse two, with all humility, with unity is the backdrop. He says, with all humility, stop right there. It's a great
[time=2097] word. It's two words brought together. First word is tapenos, tapenos. And the Greek word,
[time=2103] tapenos means low lying. It means below. It means bottom. It means down here. The other word that
[time=2109] gets combined there is the Greek word friend, Ph-R-E-N, having to do with heart, mind, and thought.
[time=2116] And in that day, tapenos, tapenos had a negative connotation. Low lying in below had to do with
[time=2124] things like slaves, had to do with things like dogs, had to do with things like weeds along the road,
[time=2130] and things of little or no regard, things that didn't matter.
[time=2137] And so when you combine the two words, it's a heart and a mind. It is a thinking that functions
[time=2147] below, low lying, not raised up, not on top. It's kind and not self-promoting. It defers to others
[time=2158] humility. You're more important than me. You go first. You sit here. I'll listen. You talk.
[time=2168] Others, more important than myself. And to keep it in the context, which we should always do,
[time=2178] to keep it in the context of where we've been in Ephesians 1 through 3, how else would we act?
[time=2184] Please don't lose sight of this. What's the condition of your heart and mind going to be
[time=2190] when God's done all that He has done for you? You. You were dead. You were hopeless.
[time=2199] You were ruled by sin. And He, He chose you. He adopted you. You can say amen. That's fine.
[time=2208] He adopted you. He saved you. He redeemed and forgave you. He sealed you with His Spirit and gave you hope and brought you into the family of God. And what are you going to be arrogant?
[time=2218] What are you going to be prideful? You're going to be overbearing and conceited? No.
[time=2227] I probably talked too loud, don't I? A poor little thing.
[time=2237] No. No. He says, "Be lowly. Be of no regard. Be gracious. Be humble."
[time=2246] I wrote this down. It's what gets in the way and stifles the effectiveness of a lot of very gifted
[time=2252] people. Oh, news flash, you're all very gifted. You're all very, those of you who know the Lord,
[time=2259] those of you who have fully surrendered your heart and life to Him, Scripture teaches you've been gifted. You've been very gifted. You're all very gifted. And I've watched it for years and years.
[time=2268] Be the one thing that gets in the way and stifles the effectiveness of a lot of very gifted people.
[time=2273] Arrogance and pride. A lofty, raised up view of themselves. And you know what? It kills. Not
[time=2285] only does it kill effectiveness in that person, it kills unity. Because those kind of folks walk
[time=2291] around and it's not you before me. It's me before you. It's not me deferring to you. It's me fighting
[time=2299] with you. It starts to view this as a club where you pay dues and when you don't like what you get,
[time=2306] you complain and you say things and you write things and you make comments and you miss the boat.
[time=2316] He says it's supposed to be a humble, lowly, you before me mindset, permeates everything
[time=2323] that we do. Back to verse two. Back to verse two. He says, "With all humility and gentleness,
[time=2331] does your translation say something other than gentleness?" Say it. Meekness, all right? Some say
[time=2339] meekness. Most translations would have gentleness. It's all the same word and that word is prayotase.
[time=2344] You can write that down. Prayotase, Aristotle had much to say about this virtue and you're sitting
[time=2352] there thinking, "Wow, I didn't know he read Aristotle." I don't. Somebody gave this to me.
[time=2358] Aristotle had much, but it's good. Listen, Aristotle had much to say about this virtue.
[time=2365] Aristotle wrote extensively about prayotase. Aristotle always said, "I love this." Aristotle always said that a virtue, gentleness in this case, Aristotle always said that a virtue is the middle
[time=2377] ground between two extremes. And so when he spoke of gentleness or prayotase, he spoke of the middle
[time=2384] or the mean, if you will, between being too angry and never being angry at all. Does that make sense?
[time=2393] He's talking about here. The word gentleness carries with it this idea again of balance or maybe better
[time=2400] said, as Aristotle himself said, a gentleman is one who is always angry at the right time and never
[time=2407] angry at the wrong time. Anybody want to say ouch? I don't do too good on that front. I still get,
[time=2421] I still get too angry at the wrong time. And sometimes I don't get angry enough when I should.
[time=2430] Anybody in that boat with me? I wish it were different. I just continue to pray and ask
[time=2440] that God will grow me in that. I believe he will. I believe he is. This gentlest thing, my friends,
[time=2448] it's one who isn't characterized by extremes. It's in the middle. You know what that is? That's
[time=2458] mature. That's seasoned. That's a lot of chipping away. Passion is okay. Aggression is all right,
[time=2469] but it's passion and aggression under control. And in this case, the control of the who? Holy Spirit.
[time=2477] Under the control of the Spirit of God, not under control of the flesh, in this case controlled
[time=2484] by the Holy Spirit. As an agent of God, you can then be useful that I want you to be and you want
[time=2494] to be. And if God wants us to be useful in a world and culture that's obsessed with the
[time=2501] out of control and the extremes and the unchecked passion, be gentle, he says, with each other.
[time=2507] Be careful with each other. We're family. We're family.
[time=2520] I've got a great family. You get me talking about or thinking about my family and the gift and
[time=2528] the blessing that God's given, Kevin and I with our kids. They've all got issues just like yours.
[time=2533] We've got all the same struggles you do as a family. Believe me. But I'm grateful and I'm so
[time=2539] thankful as I see God growing us. We'll have this discussion at times and they won't mind me saying this and I don't think you'll mind either. It's just the truth. Sometimes we'll have this discussion where I'll catch them with tensions flaring and anger up high and somebody did something and
[time=2558] took too long in the bathroom or stole this or broke that or was on the computer too long.
[time=2562] All right. We're all living in the same world. Amen. All right. So we'll have this conversation.
[time=2568] You know what? Sometimes it's not just them. Sometimes it's me. And we'll have this conversation.
[time=2574] We'll say, "Why? Why would you speak that way to your brother? Why would you talk that way to your
[time=2584] sister?" And they'll say, "Well, well, it's because they're family." And that's the point.
[time=2599] You don't talk that way to family. You don't talk that way to anybody. We'll talk about how
[time=2605] sometimes we realize that we would never talk to you in ways that sometimes we talk to each other
[time=2613] because it's family. And here in this family, we should be on the very same page, going,
[time=2623] "You know what? I'm not going to talk to you that way. I'm not going to treat you that way.
[time=2627] I'm not going to devalue you that way. I'm not going to amigo first. You're going to go first.
[time=2631] I'm going to defer to you because we're..." What? Family. Family. Be gentle. Be careful.
[time=2641] Patient intolerance. We're going to keep going as the text continues with all humility and
[time=2649] gentleness, with patience showing tolerance or your version, your translation may read for parents for one another. Patience and tolerance. Patience and tolerance. Two Greek words combined
[time=2662] here to form what is really one virtue. And the main idea here is to show patience. Macro-thumia.
[time=2670] Some of you like writing those big words down. Write that one down. Macro-thumia. It's the Greek word, which means I love this. It means ongoing grace, fostered and maintained in the face of
[time=2682] injurious. I had to look it up, so don't worry. Of injurious or difficult people.
[time=2688] Ongoing grace maintained. Macro-thumia. Patience. Ongoing grace maintained in the face of injurious
[time=2697] or difficult people. The other word in play here is anecomai, A-N-E-C-H-O-M-I-A, anecomai. It's the word
[time=2705] for tolerance or forbearance and it simply means to hold in. This is important. To hold in or hold
[time=2713] back to restrain, to stop. To stop. To not say it. To not do it. To not let it fly. To not come
[time=2727] on court. To not give them what they deserve because you've got your rights. Now it means,
[time=2734] whoa, just stop. Don't say it. Ongoing grace maintained in the face of injurious or difficult
[time=2743] people. To hold in or hold back. To restrain or stop in the context of unity and the way you would
[time=2751] talk about or treat others in the body of Christ. It means, and I love this, it means to be repeatedly
[time=2758] graceful. And we say repeatedly because in the text there when you study it, it is in the grammar,
[time=2764] in the present active. And the present active, as I've told you in the past, carries with it the idea of ongoing continuous action because they're always going to bug you. They are always going
[time=2777] to get in your way. They will never think like you think. They will never process like you process.
[time=2783] We will always, because of our differences and our diversity and our backgrounds and our sinfulness,
[time=2789] we will always be difficult for each other. And it is repeatedly, it is being repeatedly graceful
[time=2801] with difficult people. To be repeatedly graceful with difficult people and hold back. To stop
[time=2808] yourself from denouncing or distancing yourself from the difficult or just the different.
[time=2814] Bottom line, we don't get to take our marbles and go home.
[time=2826] Because this isn't a club where you pay your dues. Do you understand that? This is a family.
[time=2831] And we stay together. And we work it out. And we exercise humility and gentleness and patience
[time=2841] and forbearance. And you are different than me. And this diverse community of disciples is getting
[time=2850] more and more different as the days go by. And whether it's my preference that's
[time=2856] different, whether it's my skin color that's different, whether it's my culture and my ethnicity,
[time=2862] whether it's how much money I make or where I vacation. The differences can be catastrophic
[time=2869] and divisive or the differences can be tolerated. We can forbear. We can be patient.
[time=2876] And I love what the text does here. The text just wraps all of that up.
[time=2881] Look at the text. It says, "With all humility and gentleness with patience showing tolerance for each other, everybody in the room say those next two words." Go. That was weak.
[time=2893] Everybody say those last two words. There you go.
[time=2902] In love. You say, "What's just, it's in love." No, no, it's huge. It's in love. Love permeates.
[time=2910] Love surrounds. Love goes through. And love absolutely surrounds everything we've been
[time=2917] talking about this morning. You are too with agape. You are too with agape. The true meaning
[time=2923] for agape is "unconquerable benevolence." I love that. Unconquerable benevolence.
[time=2930] It means that no matter what happens, no matter what happens, regardless of circumstance,
[time=2936] I will seek the highest good for you. And I will do it. The highest good. And I'll do it faithfully.
[time=2943] It may cause me pain. It may cause me discomfort and loneliness. It may require enormous sacrifice
[time=2949] and effort, but I choose to love. I will. Don't need a song. Don't need a poem. Don't need a
[time=2956] hallmark card. If you want to give me one, I'll be thankful. It may give me a little fuzzy,
[time=2962] which isn't a bad deal, but love you know and I know I hope by now isn't about fuzzies.
[time=2967] Amen? Love is, agape is a decision. It is a choice empowered by the spirit of God,
[time=2977] lived out by the people of God. And he says, "You let this unquenchable. You let this unconquerable benevolence oversee and undergird all your humility and all your gentleness
[time=2992] and all your patience and all your forbearance and tolerance." He says, "We do it all lovingly."
[time=3000] And not only do we do it lovingly, but look at the text. I just love how it keeps going.
[time=3010] Not only do we do it lovingly, verse three, being, say that word out loud, diligent,
[time=3016] underline that word, circle that word, being diligent to preserve the unity of the spirit
[time=3026] in the bond of peace. I want to just show you two things there and we're going to go.
[time=3032] Number one, I want you to circle that word diligent. Not only are we to do all that we've just said this morning in love, but he said that we are to give ourselves to that kind of relationship
[time=3044] as a body. We're to do that diligently. The word in the Greek means to the point of physical exhaustion.
[time=3051] We're to work at it that hard. We're to give ourselves to not taking our marbles and going home.
[time=3061] We're to give ourselves to harmony and unity. We're to give ourselves to healthy relationships,
[time=3067] even though we're different and even though we're disappointed and even though we wish that hadn't gone that way. And even though we might disagree with how it went, he says, be diligent. Work yourself to the point of physical exhaustion if you have to in an effort to keep this
[time=3083] thing tight. Second thing I want you to notice, and I loved some discussion I had with a few who
[time=3092] pointed this out to me and helped me see this. In my Bible, I don't know about yours,
[time=3099] but in my Bible it says diligent to preserve. Does it say be diligent
[time=3111] to make it unified? Does it say be diligent to make unity? Yes or no?
[time=3120] Does it say be diligent to somehow come up with ways to keep everybody unified? Yes or no?
[time=3128] No, it says be diligent to what? Preserve which implies an already existing what?
[time=3137] Condition. We are unified. You say what are you talking about? What do you mean?
[time=3146] Look at verse 4, there's one body and one spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your
[time=3152] calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God. And Father of all who is over all and through
[time=3160] all, are you kidding me? We are as unified. We are as harmonized. We are as together as you could
[time=3166] possibly be in Christ. And it's not something we have to make. It's something that you and I have
[time=3174] to diligently maintain. It's his design. If you know his son and you fully surrendered your heart and
[time=3183] life to him, you are part of the body of Christ and there is no marble taking and going home.
[time=3188] No, we're together. We're going to sit down at the table and work it out. Part of the family.
[time=3195] You're going to eat the peas like we've said sometimes in the past. You're just going to eat what gets put on the table. We're going to eat because we're a family and we're going to work hard
[time=3206] to preserve what already exists in the bond of peace because what Christ has done. Would you
[time=3215] stand quietly and hang with me here just for a second before we dismiss and get ready to take
[time=3222] our arms offering on the way out today. I want to just say this to you.
[time=3228] You know, Black Hawk has for years and years and years, my friends, most of you know that the long history of this family. Black Hawk has for years and years benefited
[time=3240] in great ways from seasons of unity. Black Hawk has been the recipient of amazing blessing as the
[time=3251] as the people of God in this place have lived in relationship with each other with great grace
[time=3258] and humility and patience and forbearance. This church has also in years gone by
[time=3265] experienced real destruction. It's experienced some dark days where the fabric of this place
[time=3275] and the fabric of its people were at times torn apart by disunity, by impatient and
[time=3285] prideful self-seeking individuals. You and I have been a part of that at times.
[time=3294] There have been days here where it's not gone so well because it never goes well ever in the church when its people try and function outside the parameters that God's word
[time=3305] establishes. And so I want to just say to you and people who stand in front of you in the days to
[time=3311] come will say this to you and our leadership believes this with all of our heart that we're not going to concern ourselves. We haven't for a while, but I want to just say this to you. We're not going to concern ourselves with the past. Forgetting what lies behind, amen, we press on and
[time=3329] we are going to continue to press on together. We're going to continue to press on patiently.
[time=3335] We're going to tolerate each other. We're going to do our very best to exercise humility and
[time=3341] gentleness. We're going to stay away from the extremes and we're going to love unconquerable benevolence. We're going to offer that to each other and when we offer that to each
[time=3351] other and that grows that sense of unity and on-looking world sees you being benevolent and kind and
[time=3358] gracious and patient and gentle and they go, wow, check them out. The kindest, most loving,
[time=3368] gracious people we've ever met. We don't take our marbles and go home. We keep at it and we're
[time=3376] going to keep at it right along these lines. The things that Paul has said to us today and hang on, these next few chapters are going to be amazing as we learn how to live out in a balanced
[time=3388] worthy way, the calling with which we have been called. Our Father in Heaven,
[time=3394] our Father in Heaven, we clap and our hearts are filled with joy because we know that that's all
[time=3400] true. It's right. It's good and our hearts are stirred and we resonate with those things that
[time=3409] transcend our pitiful humanness and our sinfulness and all the trouble that gets us into, oh God,
[time=3416] may we continue to grow, may you continue to lead us toward the kind of church and being the kind
[time=3422] of people, the priests that you've called us to be willing to pass along you to others,
[time=3428] willing to graciously and humbly and lovingly and patiently live in relationship with those
[time=3436] inside the body so that those outside the body can be reached in an effective and genuine way.
[time=3443] Father, thank you for the time that we've been given this morning as we leave this place and as we
[time=3449] prepare for Resurrection Sundays, we begin to point our minds and our hearts and our families
[time=3457] and our attention toward the Resurrection which changed everything. Oh God, would you bless this effort? May it not just be us doing things, but would you and your word and your spirit supersede
[time=3470] and intercede on our behalf, prepare our hearts and minds for what's ahead and we'll give you
[time=3476] all the glory and all the praise and all the thanks and all the people in the room agreed and said, I am that.
[time=3500] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
