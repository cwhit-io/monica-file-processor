[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] We're thankful that you're with us as always.
[time=36] And today as you watch this at Blackhawk on the 7th of March, we have the phenomenal opportunity of welcoming back a great friend of ours, Dr. Mitchell Cruz.
[time=47] As many of you know, Mitch was a part of our family here at Blackhawk and a part of our staff as a teaching pastor for a number of years.
[time=55] And in these couple of years since Mitch's departure, he has been giving himself completely to the writing of a new book.
[time=63] And I'll tell you as I've looked at the book and as I've had a chance to talk with Mitch through this process, it has been something that I think God is gonna use in the lives of many.
[time=73] It's called Restoration Road.
[time=75] And it really is Mitch's own life story and the lessons that God taught him.
[time=79] And I think the lessons that God wants to teach many of us as God grows us and restores us in our relationship with him and others.
[time=88] I want you to watch this clip if you would just a trailer given you kind of a taste of Restoration Road and what it's all about.
[time=95] - One 79, and now 180, I've got 179, I've got 180,000.
[time=99] Three thirds up, and a fire for her, fire for her.
[time=102] And 181, finally we got 180 feet, and now 180 feet.
[time=105] 180 feet, 180 feet, 180 feet, 180 feet.
[time=108] Who wants to get 180 feet in the pelvis?
[time=110] 180 feet, 180 feet, 180 feet.
[time=112] Five, there, 180 feet.
[time=113] - He's got it!
[time=114] - And now 180 feet.
[time=115] He's got 180 feet, 180 feet, 180 feet, 180 feet, 180 feet.
[time=120] - 194 feet, 180 feet, 180 feet.
[time=122] And now 200 feet.
[time=124] - Yeah!
[time=126] - Let's go to 300,000.
[time=128] - Let's go, ladies, let's go!
[time=131] - Who wants to win again?
[time=132] - Let's go, ladies, let's go, ladies, let's go.
[time=134] - I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it.
[time=137] It's only money that'll bring you happiness today.
[time=140] - Well, like I said, so many good things and what Mitch has been able to put together, I hope that this morning as you watch this, you'll realize that there's still time for you today to come to our 1045 service and be a part of the unveiling of the book and to hear from Mitch's heart.
[time=156] We'd love to have you come today, 1045.
[time=159] If you can't make it, I want to just encourage you to go to Amazon or to go to wherever you buy your books.
[time=166] Even in town here at the Christian Family Bookstore over on Coldwater, those books are in stock.
[time=172] There's a DVD complimentary set that comes where you can follow along in your own personal study.
[time=179] There's a workbook that Mitch has provided.
[time=182] It is a great resource and tool and I hope that you'll take advantage of it.
[time=186] We're thankful for Mitch and so hopeful that many of you will be encouraged by what God has done in his life as he has restored Mitch and given him this great opportunity to proclaim the great truth of restoration.
[time=199] God bless you, we hope to see you soon.
[time=201] I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.
[time=206] So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
[time=211] When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the 12 and while they were eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me." They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, "Surely not I, Lord." Jesus replied, "The one who has dipped his hand "into the bowl with me will betray me.
[time=233] "The son of man will go just as it is written about him, "but woe to that man who betrays the son of man.
[time=239] "It would be better for him if he had not been born." Then Judas, the one who would betray him said, "Surely not I, Rabbi." Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you." While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it and gave it to his disciples saying, "Take and eat, this is my body." Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them saying, "Drink from it, all of you.
[time=267] "This is my blood of the covenant, "which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
[time=272] "I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine "from now until that day when I drink it anew with you "in my father's kingdom.
[time=279] "When they had sung a hymn, "they went out to the Mount of Olives." (gentle piano music)
[time=290] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 87 seconds]
[time=385] - Stand together.
[time=387] (gentle piano music)
[time=400] [MUSIC - 158 seconds]
[time=563] Sing it again.
[time=565] [MUSIC - 165 seconds]
[time=736] (gentle music) - Let's sing one more verse again.
[time=742] [MUSIC - 68 seconds]
[time=821] (upbeat music) - Well, you know, every once in a while, I get the privilege of being able to introduce to you all, those of you in our Black Hawk viewing audience, people who have meant a lot to me, people who have had an impact in my life.
[time=837] And today, I get a chance to introduce you to not only somebody who's done that, but a really, really good friend.
[time=844] Scott Artevanis was my roommate in college.
[time=847] And I'll tell you, the experiences that God gave us and the friendship that God forged in those days back in the mid '80s is something that has stayed with me my whole life.
[time=859] Every once in a while, you know, you get friends that stay with you for life.
[time=862] And Scott has stayed with me for life.
[time=865] He pastors today at a church in the Santa Clarita Valley there in Southern California, Placerita Church.
[time=871] And I can't tell you how hopeful and how thankful I am for what you're about to experience as you hear Scott's message that he gave to the family here at Black Hawk today.
[time=883] Scott has a deep love for the word of God and an even deeper love for the church.
[time=889] And I hope as you watch and listen today that you'll sense his passion.
[time=893] I hope that you'll open your heart to what God has for you as he teaches from the Book of Mark and gets you and I to again think about what it means to really follow our Lord.
[time=904] Scott and Patty and their family mean a great deal to the birds.
[time=908] And these days that we've gotten to spend with them as they've been here visiting have just reminded us of how precious and dear friendships are.
[time=916] I'm thankful for Scott.
[time=918] And if you're thankful for what you hear today, there's a website here at the bottom of the screen.
[time=923] It's the website there at his church in Southern California.
[time=925] You could just shoot him a quick note and thank him for the ministry that he brought to your own life today.
[time=932] I'm so thankful for Scott Art of Anis, thankful for his friendship.
[time=936] And I know you will be too as you watch the message today.
[time=939] God bless you guys.
[time=940] We love you.
[time=941] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=943] (congregation applauding) - It's great, great to be here with you.
[time=949] I've been here one other time, maybe just passing through when I was pastoring in Chicago.
[time=955] And just great to be back with Kelly and Kebra.
[time=960] And I was just thinking as I was sitting there, I remember when Kelly met Kebra at the Masters College and he was so excited to tell me about that.
[time=968] And I can remember that just like yesterday and so thankful for their family, their friendship, their children.
[time=977] It was a joy to be in their home this week and just see obedient children who are underneath mom and dad.
[time=986] It was just a blessing to Patty and I.
[time=988] And Kelly and I have gone back many, many years.
[time=991] And we've had the greatest times together, probably laughing that I've ever had.
[time=997] And we've also shared some hardships together of ministry.
[time=1001] And that's the type of friend he is both in the great times and in the key times where I would need wisdom on a certain matter in my ministry.
[time=1010] I've called him and I have found his words to me and his advice to me so true.
[time=1017] And I've shared that with many people in other context.
[time=1020] And so great to be here Kelly and see little Jake there and get a basketball game at Black Hawk and watch Russell.
[time=1030] It's just been a real, real privilege.
[time=1032] Well, I want you to take your Bible this morning and look over to Mark chapter eight, Mark chapter eight.
[time=1039] And maybe as you're turning there, one of the things that would have come up on the screen during the announcement was exciting to my own heart.
[time=1046] There's a team going to Serbia to do an English camp and that's with JV ministry.
[time=1054] And I have one of the hats I play as I am a JV board member.
[time=1060] And I love that ministry.
[time=1062] And that ministry is being widely used of God in 10, 11 different countries around the globe.
[time=1070] It started back in '94, just in the Czech Republic.
[time=1074] And now it's gone out and Serbia is one of those.
[time=1077] And a few young people have an opportunity to go.
[time=1080] I would say go.
[time=1082] I was just at a board meeting two weeks ago in Phoenix and the accounts of what are coming out of these countries is revolutionary because it's in Eastern Europe and most of those countries are 1% believers.
[time=1097] And so it is a definite mission field and Serbia is one of those.
[time=1102] And if you can go or support someone going, I greatly, greatly encourage you to do that.
[time=1108] Let me read for you.
[time=1109] Mark chapter eight on this theme of discipleship and the cost of discipleship.
[time=1114] And no doubt if you've been in Christ, you've seen this passage before, but follow with me as I read beginning at 834 where he summoned the crowd with his disciples and he said to them, if anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself, take up his cross and follow me.
[time=1133] For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospels will save it.
[time=1142] For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?
[time=1147] For what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
[time=1152] For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the son of man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his father with the holy angels.
[time=1166] It's a great passage of scripture.
[time=1168] In fact, I think it's one of the clearest statements in all of the Bible on what it means to follow Jesus Christ.
[time=1177] You hear at Black Hawk Ministry or committed to discipleship.
[time=1180] And certainly this is one of the keynote passages in all of the New Testament on what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ.
[time=1190] If you glance down just as we begin in verse 34, you'll just note at the beginning there that he summoned the crowd with his disciples.
[time=1199] In other words, he's not just saying this to the 12, it is a universal call for all who would follow Christ.
[time=1206] It is a call that is extended to any of you this morning.
[time=1210] This is not for leaders only.
[time=1212] This is not just for the disciples.
[time=1214] He summoned the crowd.
[time=1216] In other words, this is a call given by Jesus Christ.
[time=1221] Now the question that would come is this.
[time=1224] What does it exactly mean to follow Christ?
[time=1227] When Jesus said, "Come after me, follow me." What does he mean by that?
[time=1234] What are the implications of that even today?
[time=1236] And so as we look at the text this morning, I wanna look at two truths that describe what it means for you as a believer in the 21st century to follow Christ.
[time=1247] Just two truths on what it means to follow Christ.
[time=1252] We're gonna look first, I hope a little bit more briefly, on the radical nature of following Christ.
[time=1258] And then secondly, we're gonna look at the reasons for following Christ.
[time=1263] Now the radical nature of following Christ is those short, just powerful statements on what the cost involves.
[time=1272] But my focus I trust this morning is gonna be on that second principle on the reasons and even the motivation for following Christ.
[time=1281] Maybe you're a young person this morning and you're thinking, "Hey, why should I follow?" I remember when I was a teenager and I began to look at the commands of Christ and I began to see these things jump off the page.
[time=1293] I just took a step back and there were times in my teenage years that I had to say, "Is this really what I wanna do?
[time=1300] Do I really wanna give my life to Christ?
[time=1303] Is this really something that I can bank my whole life on it?" And by the way, it's demanding everything.
[time=1311] Is there something in it for me?
[time=1314] And I think so often we grow up in the church and these commands come and these commands stand as you see them, but I wanna just say that the scripture goes on to give you the motivation and even offer the reason why you should follow them.
[time=1329] In fact, if you just glance at your Bible, certainly you've seen verse 36 before.
[time=1334] What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?
[time=1338] I used to think that those were challenges that were evangelistic in nature and I suppose they could be.
[time=1345] But when you look at verse 36, in fact, when you look at 35 to 38, I believe what the Lord is doing there is giving you encouragement to follow Christ.
[time=1355] In other words, he's providing the reasons on why we should live out the commitment that is expressed in verse 34.
[time=1363] Well, very well, let's look first at the radical nature of following Christ.
[time=1367] You'll notice that Jesus said in the text, if anyone wishes to come after me and the wishes there is in the present tense, he's talking about not just a coming at one time but a continual pursuit to follow Christ.
[time=1381] Now, he says there in verse 34, "If anyone wishes and he uses this phrase to come after me, "it's the ideal of taking a position behind Jesus." So what he's saying even now by the Spirit of God this morning is listen, if you're in and you're in this place and you say, "I wanna follow the Master," and then you're gonna say here with the Lord Jesus, "You need to come after me." Jesus is saying, "You need to stand behind me." Now, what follows then in verse 34 is an explanation of what it means to come after me.
[time=1415] And he lists there three vital commitments.
[time=1418] Let me just touch on those.
[time=1420] The first one there in verse 34 is he must deny himself, this principle there of self-denial.
[time=1427] In other words, if you really wanna follow Christ, it means you need to disown yourself.
[time=1433] That's what it means to be a Christian.
[time=1435] That's what it means to be involved in discipleship.
[time=1438] If you're gonna follow Christ and stand behind him, then you and the words of Christ will renounce yourself altogether.
[time=1445] That when you come to a living relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ, you are going to sever any relationship that takes priority over that of Jesus Christ.
[time=1458] Certainly you're at a season where you're preparing for Easter.
[time=1462] Some of you may be giving up certain things and that's fine, but the truth is, and we know this together, your whole life is giving something up, isn't it?
[time=1470] You're not gonna just give it up at the season though that's fine.
[time=1473] Your whole life, if you say I'm a Christian, is one of following the Lord and then denying yourself.
[time=1480] In other words, when you become a Christian, you have shifted the center of gravity from self, from to, if you will, the abandonment to the will of God.
[time=1492] When you come to Christ and deny self, you deny self as the controlling center of life.
[time=1498] This is what a Christian means.
[time=1500] In fact, maybe some of you are wondering about that.
[time=1503] I make no bones about it.
[time=1504] This is the command of Christ.
[time=1506] If you come to Christ, you give up all who you are.
[time=1509] You give up your personality.
[time=1511] You give up your desire for honor.
[time=1515] You come and you live a life of self denial.
[time=1517] That's what Jesus said.
[time=1519] However we conceive of discipleship, it is that.
[time=1523] And so as I think about this season, certainly some people renounce chocolate, okay?
[time=1528] Some people renounce caffeine.
[time=1530] Some people are renouncing carbs.
[time=1532] That's fine.
[time=1533] But when you think about this command on the radical nature of following Christ, you are renouncing yourself altogether for all time.
[time=1541] You see?
[time=1542] And then you follow with him.
[time=1544] In other words, you renounce everything you are in the flesh, everything you trust in, and you give your entire life over to God.
[time=1552] It is to say no to self-ideology and yes to God.
[time=1556] In other words, you begin to prioritize that relationship with him above everything else.
[time=1562] And while you're in that context of self-denial, there's a second command in this radical nature in verse 34.
[time=1569] You've seen it before.
[time=1571] There is a cross to carry.
[time=1573] A cross to carry, it says there to take up his cross.
[time=1578] Now of course, what does that mean to take up one's cross?
[time=1583] Certainly people wear a cross today, don't they?
[time=1586] Some of you might have one on it and you're remembering that.
[time=1589] But the question in verse 34 is, what did it mean to Mark's readers?
[time=1595] I mean, when they heard Jesus say, deny self, take up your cross.
[time=1599] What did it mean when those disciples and certainly the crowd heard that?
[time=1604] Well, I assure you of this, it's not taking up a cross.
[time=1608] That's not what Jesus is talking about.
[time=1610] And by that, I mean taking up an irritating situation.
[time=1614] I've heard people say, I have a cross to bear in my life.
[time=1617] Well, what is that?
[time=1618] Well, I have a difficult commute to work.
[time=1621] I've heard people say that.
[time=1622] In fact, in L.A. where I live, it's very common, not a joke.
[time=1626] A lot of people spend over three hours a day on the highways.
[time=1630] Hour and a half to, sometimes more hour and a half home, that's a cross.
[time=1635] I don't think that's what Jesus is talking about.
[time=1637] I don't think Jesus, when he says take up your cross, is talking about you having a difficult boss or potentially some of you having a difficult mother-in-law, okay?
[time=1647] Listen, when Jesus said, take up your cross, he's referring to that gruesome instrument of pain, that gruesome instrument of execution that was used on runaway slaves and criminals.
[time=1660] In other words, you understand this, Black Hawk, if you were to take up a cross and carry a cross, you were on your way to what?
[time=1668] To death.
[time=1669] So listen, when the disciples heard this, I think we just grow so custom to it.
[time=1673] I think when they heard Jesus say that, they just went, let me put it in our setting.
[time=1679] It would be like saying this morning, pick up your electric chair and follow me to the execution room.
[time=1686] That's what it would be like.
[time=1688] In other words, when you come to Christ, if you really want to stand behind him, then you live a life of self-denial.
[time=1693] You take up your cross, you do not turn back, if you will.
[time=1698] You prepare to die.
[time=1700] And I think what's interesting here, if you see it in the flow of the context, this is the same context.
[time=1705] Remember in 829, when Peter said, remember that, you are the, what?
[time=1713] Christ, I think what Jesus is saying this.
[time=1715] He's saying it's not enough just to confess me.
[time=1718] You have got to obey me.
[time=1721] You can't just say who I am.
[time=1723] You've got to live in.
[time=1724] And so here is discipleship.
[time=1726] It's denial, it's bearing a cross.
[time=1728] And of course, we understand that principle that comes to us in our life practically when Paul said, I've been crucified with Christ.
[time=1737] So here to take up a cross certainly is a choice.
[time=1740] It's not something that comes to you because of your circumstances that forced it upon you.
[time=1746] Crosses are not actively accepted.
[time=1749] They are actively chosen for Jesus' sake.
[time=1752] So listen, here's what it means to follow Christ.
[time=1755] Self-denial, take up your cross.
[time=1757] Thirdly, under this first point, Jesus says in verse 34, to follow me.
[time=1763] And you understand, and I just mention this, you're always following a relationship, aren't you?
[time=1769] When you follow Christ, you're not following a religion.
[time=1772] You're following a person.
[time=1774] And so Jesus gives this third command here.
[time=1776] He says, you got to follow me.
[time=1778] And it's put again in the present tense, meaning that you're to continually follow me.
[time=1782] But here's the question that I want to drive out this morning, is that when we are confronted by the cost of discipleship, and here's what I want to ask you, why take up your cross?
[time=1796] That's the question.
[time=1797] Do we talk about this much anymore?
[time=1799] Or do we just tell people?
[time=1801] Would that be enough for me to say, hey, come, you got to do this.
[time=1804] You got to do this, you got to do it.
[time=1805] No, that's not what Jesus only did.
[time=1808] He's going to go on to ask the motivation behind it.
[time=1812] And so I'm asking you, why a life of self-denial?
[time=1816] Why would you follow the Lord?
[time=1819] Why would you take up a cross?
[time=1823] And the question that begins to come out of the text is, is there motivation for such a cost?
[time=1830] Does Jesus attach any type of motivation for you to live in this light?
[time=1838] And I would say big time, yes.
[time=1841] Big time, yes.
[time=1843] You say that there's a reason I should follow, yes.
[time=1846] And if you look again in the text in 35 through 38, he's going to provide those reasons or the motivation for following Christ.
[time=1856] In other words, he's going to say that the benefits are incredible.
[time=1860] They're incredible.
[time=1862] Now, again, as we walk through 35 and 38 through a minute, in a minute, I thought these were evangelistic.
[time=1868] And again, they can be.
[time=1870] But primarily, they're here for you.
[time=1873] If you're following Christ and you're living in denial, you're taking up your cross, you're about ready to put yourself online at work because you're not going to compromise, then what's in it for me?
[time=1887] I sat down not long ago with a man in our church who works in Hollywood.
[time=1892] We're just around the corner from us, 30 miles or so.
[time=1897] And he's bypassed a lot of jobs.
[time=1901] He said, Scott, it's hard.
[time=1904] He goes, I bypassed this one, some show, $300,000
[time=1910] for his company.
[time=1912] People look at him and think, you're an idiot.
[time=1915] And I'm asking you, is he?
[time=1918] Do you just give that stuff away and live with integrity?
[time=1923] Does he get something out of that?
[time=1926] Or is it just that we give it up and this life is a drudgery?
[time=1930] And if you're a young person, yeah, I guess I'm a Christian.
[time=1933] Or do you see the infinite value of what this life will look like?
[time=1938] You know what's amazing to me in the scripture is the scripture gives us wonderful reasons for following Christ.
[time=1944] In fact, just before we dive into the text, look back at the next chapter in Mark chapter 10.
[time=1951] Because remember, Peter was wondering, hey, do I get something out of this?
[time=1955] Peter, in chapter 10 of Mark, verse 28, begin to say to him, behold, we've left everything and followed you.
[time=1965] Now, you can't see it in Mark's gospel.
[time=1967] But one of the other gospel writers says this, that when Peter said we've left everything and followed you, there was another line in another gospel that says, do we get anything?
[time=1978] Is there anything for us?
[time=1979] And do you remember this stunning answer by Jesus in Mark 10 29?
[time=1984] He says, truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms for my sake and for the gospel's sake, but that he will receive a hundred times much as now in the present age houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms along with persecutions and in the age to come, what?
[time=2009] Eternal life.
[time=2011] Listen, listen, there's none of us, myself included, who have ever given anything up that we've not been rewarded back in this life.
[time=2021] And certainly, if it's not in this life because he does mention persecution, he mentions the aspect of eternal life.
[time=2029] I like what C.S. Lewis said, do you believe this?
[time=2032] I do.
[time=2033] He said, Lewis said, the New Testament has lots to say about self-denial but not about self-denial as an end in itself.
[time=2041] We are told to deny ourselves, take up our crosses in order that we may follow Christ.
[time=2046] Here's how he ended it.
[time=2048] He said, nearly every description of what we shall ultimately find if we do so, he said, contains an appeal to desire.
[time=2057] In other words, the Lord never gives us a command
[time=2063] in a vacuum.
[time=2065] He gives us a command and there's usually some kind of reward attached to it.
[time=2072] Now, you say, well, Scott, how does this work?
[time=2074] I mean, that's kind of weird.
[time=2076] On the one hand, he tells you, live a life of self-denial, take up your cross and follow me, go to your death if necessary.
[time=2085] But on the other hand, you're saying that the Lord includes a reward absolutely.
[time=2090] You say, what do you call that?
[time=2091] I call that a paradox.
[time=2094] It seems like a contradiction, but it's not.
[time=2097] It's an apparent self-contradiction.
[time=2099] It's actually an absurdity, but in fact, it's true.
[time=2102] You win by losing.
[time=2105] That's the nature of the gospel message.
[time=2108] Let me show you just three reasons why that's true.
[time=2111] I'm gonna put him in the statement of a paradox, okay?
[time=2114] First, the paradox of life.
[time=2116] Look what he said back in 935, and this is to you.
[time=2120] He said in 35, for whoever wishes to save his life
[time=2127] will lose it.
[time=2129] But whoever loses his life, for my sake, and the gospels will, what, save it.
[time=2135] I mean, I think we get that.
[time=2137] Jesus says, if you wanna save your life in this world, then in the next one, you will, what?
[time=2147] You will lose it.
[time=2149] This is the message of Christianity.
[time=2151] If it's all about this world, living in the 21st century, and you don't understand the commitment, and you don't want the commitment, and you see the commands, it's hard, then listen, you may be here this morning, but you will lose it in the life to come.
[time=2167] Jesus says, look again at verse 35, but whoever loses his life, you say, well, Scott, what does that mean to lose your life?
[time=2176] I think Jesus just spoke about losing life.
[time=2179] He talked about denying self, taking up your cross, following me.
[time=2183] If you lose your life, verse 35, for my sake, and the gospels, you will actually, what, save it.
[time=2192] I think Jesus put it in another way in John 12, 25.
[time=2196] He said, whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.
[time=2207] You know, I grew up with the same, at least in Southern California.
[time=2210] Did you ever have this one here in the Midwest?
[time=2212] It was called finders, keepers.
[time=2216] Did you have that one?
[time=2217] Losers, weepers.
[time=2219] But you know, the funny thing in the kingdom of God, it's the opposite.
[time=2223] If you find life here, you lose it in the life to come.
[time=2228] If you lose your life here, you keep it in the life to come.
[time=2233] And so I'm asking you, listen, when you follow the Christ, you get everything.
[time=2240] Now listen, Jesus doesn't have to reason with us, but he does.
[time=2245] He says, you listen, if you love me, and he's pleading with us, he's trying to get us to come to the correct conclusion that even if you can get the entire world for yourself, you'd still leave it all behind.
[time=2260] So here's the first paradox, the paradox of life, losing his finding, giving his receiving, and to sacrifice it all is to gain all.
[time=2270] And then look, secondly, there's a second parable under this reason.
[time=2273] It's the paradox, excuse me, the paradox of the world.
[time=2277] You've seen this scripture in verse 36, for what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his, what?
[time=2286] So listen, young people, are you holding out on the Lord?
[time=2291] Do you think there's a life for you outside of the Lord?
[time=2298] I'll tell you, there is no life outside of the Lord.
[time=2301] Jesus said here, what does it profit a man if he gained the whole world, and he lost his, what?
[time=2308] His soul, what do you really, really gain?
[time=2312] I remember when I was even 14, I don't know why I said this, but I'm a teenager, and I've been growing up in a church since I was eight.
[time=2323] And I used to say to myself, you know what, I don't think I'm gonna give my life to Christ right now.
[time=2328] And somehow in the back of my mind, I think I'm gonna wait 'til I'm 35.
[time=2333] And I don't know why I said this, but I thought I'm gonna just push the Lord out, and then when I'm older, I'm gonna connect to the Lord and get it right, and God and His grace and His mercy saved me not long after that, and I'm so thankful.
[time=2348] Listen, if you this morning could be Bill Gates, if you could own the world, what would it profit a man if he gained the whole world, and he forfeited his, what?
[time=2363] Soul, listen, what Jesus is telling you, listen, if you give it all up, you gain it and all in return.
[time=2371] You give it up all now in terms of denial, cross-bearing, following, listen, you gain eternal life.
[time=2377] And sometimes I think when we see that phrase eternal life, we associate it with duration of life.
[time=2384] But in the Jewish mind, when they describe eternal life, it always described a quality of life, a kind of life.
[time=2392] It's not just that we live with him forever, but we live in quality of life both here and in the age to come, and listen, I would just say it to this way, to you young people and even you adults, you would be an absolute fool not to walk with Christ.
[time=2407] You would be, and you would just, what are you doing if you didn't follow Christ?
[time=2413] I'm thinking about the guy in Luke chapter 12, when Jesus said the land of a certain rich man is very productive.
[time=2419] He sounds like somebody living in Los Angeles.
[time=2423] He began to reason to himself in Luke 12, saying, what shall I do?
[time=2427] Since I have no place to store my crops, you see the personal pronouns come out.
[time=2432] He said, this is what I will do.
[time=2434] I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and all my goods, and I will say to my soul, soul, you have many goods laid up for many years to come.
[time=2447] Take your ease, eat, drink, and be what?
[time=2451] Mary.
[time=2452] But here's what Luke 12, 20 says.
[time=2454] God said to him, you fool.
[time=2459] He said, this very night, your soul is required of you, and who will own what you have prepared?
[time=2467] Listen, you know what that guy was?
[time=2469] Using the words of God in the scripture, he was a fool.
[time=2473] He took all the time to invest in his crops, his barns, larger ones, and then all of a sudden, his day was up and God called him a fool.
[time=2484] Jesus went on to say, so is the man who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich towards God.
[time=2492] There was a writer many years back.
[time=2496] His name was William Somerset Mom, and they called him Willie.
[time=2501] Maybe some of you have heard of it.
[time=2504] He was one of the most prolific writer back in the 20th century at the early part of it, and some of his stuff is still being used in plays and so forth, but he was a fabulously rich, rich, rich man.
[time=2521] And in the end, what did he get?
[time=2525] Well, the London Times carried an excerpt from his nephew, his nephew was Robin Mom.
[time=2531] He said, this is what his nephew said, I looked around the drawing room at the immensely valuable furniture and the pictures and the objects of Willie's success that he had enabled him to acquire.
[time=2544] I remember the villa itself and the wonderful garden, and I can see through the windows a fabulous setting on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea, they were worth millions.
[time=2557] He goes on to say that Willie had 11 servants, including a cook by the name of Annette, who was the envy of all the other millionaires on the Riviera.
[time=2566] He dined off silver plates.
[time=2567] He was waited on by Marius, his butler, and Henry, his footman.
[time=2572] And the following afternoon, his nephew said, I found Willie reclining on a sofa, peering through his spectacles at a Bible.
[time=2579] He looked horrible, his face was grim.
[time=2582] Here's what Willie said to his nephew.
[time=2584] He said, I've been reading the Bible you gave me, and I've come across the quotation, what shall it profit a man if he gained the whole world and forfeit his soul?
[time=2594] He went on to say, I must tell you, my dear Robin, that the text used to hang opposite my bed when I was a child.
[time=2601] And then he said, of course, it's all a lot of bunk, but the thought of it is quite interesting, all the same.
[time=2610] That was over 40 years ago.
[time=2613] I guarantee you right now, he doesn't think it's a lot of bunk.
[time=2616] Listen, what you do with the person of Christ will reap you an eternal destiny.
[time=2625] And if you could have all the fame that this man had and all the novels that he wrote, and you stand before God, and you don't have a personal relationship with Christ, you have nothing, nothing, right?
[time=2639] But listen, if you're here this morning and you can sing as we sang earlier, when you look back on your salvation when the Lord saved you, you have everything.
[time=2648] I read in history that 180 years after the death
[time=2654] of Charlemagne, King Charlemagne, it was the year 1000 AD officials, of one of the emperors at that time, opened the Great Kings tomb, and they found an amazing sight, obviously, they found the treasure, but they found something, I think, much more amazing than the treasure.
[time=2672] What they saw was this, was the skeletal remains of the king who was seated on his throne.
[time=2683] Imagine this.
[time=2684] There was a threat, he was on his throne, and then there was a crown that was still upon his bony skull, if you will.
[time=2694] There's a copy of the gospels lying in his lap with his bony finger resting on Mark 836.
[time=2703] What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and he won?
[time=2708] Forfits his soul.
[time=2710] Listen, this is for us, this ought to encourage us, right?
[time=2716] I mean, I was walking the other day, have you been there to this place called my saying it right, Kelly?
[time=2721] Spiece?
[time=2723] I've never seen anything like it in my life.
[time=2726] I mean, I live in Los Angeles, they don't have anything that cool.
[time=2730] I'm walking through it, I'm just like, whoa, this is incredible, these courts, and this workout stuff, and then I'm kind of walking through, you know, the pictures and the portraits, and I saw this one of the Van Arsedale's brothers.
[time=2744] They played in Indiana, I didn't know this, and I met those guys, one time when I was a little boy, I was at the form to watch the Laker game, and I was playing before the game, and at halftime as a little kid, and I'm walking in one of the deep recesses of the form where the Lakers used to play, and I'm in one of the tunnels, and there were the Van Arsedale's coming out of the locker room, the Lakers were playing, I believe it was then the Phoenix Suns, and I saw them up there, and I saw all the stuff, and I thought, it's awesome, right?
[time=2775] But listen, can you imagine standing before the Lord and not knowing Him?
[time=2782] Can you imagine standing before the Lord and saying, listen, the cost was too great?
[time=2787] Can you imagine standing before Him and denying Him because you didn't live a life of self-denial?
[time=2794] Can you imagine standing before Him thinking you were in the kingdom and you're not in the kingdom because that cost doesn't mark your life?
[time=2801] Listen, I'm not saying these things, watch this, save us, and we're saved by our commitment to Him.
[time=2807] I think Jesus is just saying this is an evidence of grace.
[time=2811] If you're truly in the kingdom, then these principles are yours, but what would you profit if you gained the whole world and you forfeited your soul?
[time=2819] Few years back, I was with my son, and there's a young man at our church who played on the Lakers some years back, and he played with Shaq, and he played with Kobe, and it was really fun 'cause one time he just gave us these tickets to the Cole Center.
[time=2842] You know, this is in Milwaukee.
[time=2844] And I'm like, okay, we'll come watch a play.
[time=2846] So he puts these tickets on will call, and I tell my son, I didn't tell him where we're going.
[time=2850] I said, we're just going to an event for ministry.
[time=2853] Okay, Dad, I'd love to hang out with ya.
[time=2855] So we get in the car and we're driving, we're just not too far from Chicago, just up north, and there we come to the, it's either the Cole or the Bradley Center, I forget what they called it, and outside it just looks like a conference center.
[time=2868] So he still doesn't get it, I walk up the will call, I said, two tickets for Art of Anis, and we watch the Milwaukee Bucks and the Lakers play, and on the back of my little envelope, it says meet me at section, I don't know, 41 after the game.
[time=2882] I thought, okay, so we go over to section 41, there's a place roped off, there's people there waiting for the players.
[time=2888] Then a guy in the blue jacket comes up and taps me and he says, are you waiting for his name, was Mike Penbirth?
[time=2894] I said, sure, we're waiting for Mike Penbirthy, and I thought, how did he know that?
[time=2898] And so he says, he wants you to come here, and so he brought me up closer to this roped off section, and Mike came out, he gave us some jerseys, he gave us some, it was just really cool.
[time=2909] He goes, ah, what the heck?
[time=2910] And he says, let these guys in.
[time=2912] And he brings us into the inner locker room of the Lakers, and all the players are walking out, okay?
[time=2920] All of them, after they had been dressed, my son meets all of them.
[time=2923] I'm just standing back there with my friend Mike, and I see my son just walking around like this.
[time=2927] They're all coming out, they're just everyone, but there was one that he wanted to meet, he wanted to meet Shaquille O'Neal, you know, Shaq?
[time=2936] And sure enough, about 20 minutes later, the door opens in this little inner room where we were, and I could have thought that smoke was rising up, and it was like Darth Vader coming.
[time=2948] He's huge, I mean, he's a humongous man.
[time=2954] Kelly and I have played with many seven footers, but I've never seen a guy this big.
[time=2959] It wasn't just that he was seven foot one, he's like 340 pounds, he's massive, and so he comes over, I think the ground, no I was just okay, he comes over, and my son is with me, so I meet Mr. O'Neal, Mike, said diesel, come here, and he just kind of comes over, he's just big, and so I'm talking to Shaq, and my son's just like this the whole time.
[time=2982] He's looking down, so I'm like, well, great game, glad you won tonight, and how's Mike doing, and I'm talking to him, all the guys were there, and the whole time, maybe 30, 45 seconds ago, my son's like this, and so I start hitting him with my hand, and I finally had to say, "John, would you meet Mr. O'Neal?" To kind of jolt him, and it was funny, he goes like this, and he looks up to me, he must have been like eight or nine at the time, he looks up to me, and he goes, "Dad!" And I said, "What?" He goes, "His shoes are this big!" You see, he didn't care about me and Shaq, the dude has size 22 sneakers.
[time=3032] In fact, when you look at him, they look like a small water ski.
[time=3035] I mean, it's just, so I had to get his attention, and it was the funnest night, and we're driving back in my little Hyundai, you know, and he says, "Dad, that was the best night of my life." And I said, "Well, Johnny, I'm glad, "because that'll never happen again in your life." It was one of those weird nights, you'd never get past, I've been to other games at the stable center, or the back then, and even when they came and played the Chicago Bulls, but you can't get in the locker room, maybe that we would have got up in Milwaukee, but I told John, "Is this not true?" I said, "It's one thing to meet a famous basketball player." I said, "But you know the living God." Isn't that what it's all about?
[time=3078] Listen, when it's all said and done, none of that stuff is gonna matter.
[time=3083] If you can have the whole world, and you don't have a relationship with Christ, then you have nothing.
[time=3088] On the other hand, if you have Christ, you have everything.
[time=3093] And I think the Lord has just given us motivation here to follow him.
[time=3099] You know, a few years back, I was driving with my wife, and we were in this place.
[time=3105] If you heard of it, Newport Beach.
[time=3108] And I mean, it's just, it's kind of surreal down there.
[time=3112] I'm first in ministry, Kelly.
[time=3113] Do you remember the yellow dots that I had?
[time=3116] It was a yellow dots in B210.
[time=3119] It was so bad that when I would shift, something happened to the shift.
[time=3122] I could see the ground when I was driving, you know?
[time=3126] And I'm kind of like, we're just trying to get down, our cousins live right by the beach in Newport, and there's all these fancy cars driving by, and there's people coming out of convertibles, and there's music blaring.
[time=3139] It's a summer day down in Newport, and I get to the stoplight, and it's like, I'm trying to keep my car from not stalling.
[time=3146] And this, you young people might know it, this Ferrari pulls up next to me.
[time=3152] And I don't even know how to say it, I just call it a test of Verde.
[time=3155] I don't know, from the quarterback.
[time=3156] It's a Ferrari, it's this red cherry Ferrari, and the dude just played the role perfect.
[time=3162] He, it was like a convertible or a half top, and he had his sunglasses on, the oil all over, his brown sun taps, you know, sun tanned arms, the subwoofers were going, it's go, go, go, go, go, go, you know.
[time=3176] And I'm in my car, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[time=3179] And I look over, I think he's over on this side, and my wife's here in this car, I said, would you look at that car?
[time=3186] And she looks over, and the guy's just kind of like, he looks over and goes, you know, he's so cool, you know?
[time=3192] I go, look at that car.
[time=3193] And my wife goes, well, it's just a car.
[time=3197] I said, Patty, that is a Ferrari, that is worth more than our condo all by itself right there.
[time=3206] And she looks back and she goes, it's just a car.
[time=3209] And I'm a pastor, and I said, but Patty, that's a nice car, you know what I'm saying?
[time=3214] And he's still got the music going.
[time=3216] And then she, I'll never forget what she said.
[time=3218] She just looked back at me, and she said, Scott, it's just a piece of metal, and it's all gonna burn.
[time=3226] And I thought to myself that scripture popped into my mind with Peter that all these things are gonna melt with intense heat.
[time=3233] And as soon as she said that, I kind of revved my car a little bit, you know?
[time=3238] And took off down the street because at the end of the day, I'd rather be driving a car that's fallen apart in having a relationship with the Lord than to drive a car like that and stand bankrupt before God, wouldn't you?
[time=3252] So Jesus, he, look what he says here, what's a prophet a man?
[time=3256] If he gains the entire world and he forfeits his soul, listen young people, you're not gonna gain anything by holding out on the Lord, don't do what I did.
[time=3268] You follow the Lord, listen, there may be things that you sacrifice, it may include denial it does, it may include taking up your cross, it may include cutting off a relationship, it may include cutting off a business partner and not moving towards something that's gonna stain your conscience, but I'm telling you in the end, you follow that.
[time=3289] The Lord's gonna return to you both 100 fold in this life and I'm not talking about wealth and prosperity.
[time=3295] He's gonna return to you relationships that are so significant and in that whole picture, he's gonna give you eternal life.
[time=3304] Listen, you love Christ, you live for him and these commands will come for Jesus said, look in 37, what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
[time=3315] He can't give anything in exchange for that because it's priceless.
[time=3322] Listen, the greatest life is to follow the Lord Jesus Christ, isn't it?
[time=3326] You follow him with boldness, you follow him with unflinching just commitment to him and he will honor you, he will bless you and in the age to come, he'll give you eternal life.
[time=3339] That's a great deal, isn't it?
[time=3340] In fact, I just say this, to walk out of this room and to not follow Christ, maybe you've not heard it said this way and I'm not trying to be rude, but you'd really be a fool.
[time=3350] It would almost be like you're walking out with a gun in your hand, with a bullet in one of the chambers, spinning the chambers and waiting to think, hey, you know what, maybe when I'm 35 like me.
[time=3365] Listen, don't play with the grace of God, he's got such a fantastic life filled with joy as you follow the Master.
[time=3373] Would you pray with me?
[time=3375] Would you pray with me as your head is bowed?
[time=3380] Maybe this has become crystal clear just even in your last week or month and maybe you've walked the narrow road that Jesus talked about.
[time=3392] Thank him for it because when it's all said and done, you'll never feel like you sacrificed anything.
[time=3398] He will say enter into the joy of your Master.
[time=3402] And you can thank him for that.
[time=3406] Maybe as you come here this morning, you're on the edge somewhere and you're wondering if this is all worth it, I would say, oh, it's fabulously worth it.
[time=3415] At least the Lord would say, would he not?
[time=3418] That when Peter said, hey, we've left everything, what do we get?
[time=3421] Well, Jesus said, here's a fabulous reward, not only in this life by way of relationships, but by way of eternal life.
[time=3431] Father, I pray, maybe there's one in here who has just been checking things out, wondering if it's worth it and Lord, it is worth it.
[time=3442] I'm thinking of that King Charlemagne who maybe at one point was ruling in that kingdom with all glory and power and majesty and authority, but nevertheless was reduced to a bones, as we all will, but a soul lasts forever.
[time=3460] Lord, I pray that we would be wise with our life.
[time=3462] Give us joy as we serve you.
[time=3465] Father, be pleased to open a heart here and save some that they would turn their life over to completely to your control.
[time=3474] We ask this now and give thanks in your name.
[time=3477] And everyone said, amen.
[time=3480] Okay, brother, thanks.
[time=3482] (upbeat music)
