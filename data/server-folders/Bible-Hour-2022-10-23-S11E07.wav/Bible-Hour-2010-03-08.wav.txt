[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=33] It's great to have you with us, and it is really good to have my friend Mitchell Cruz with us, Mitchell, as many of you know, who've watched the Bible Hour over the past several years, was for a number of years, I think four or five years, a part of our team here at Black Hawk.
[time=51] He's been a part of my life for the past eight years, and I can't tell you how thankful I am and how much we've been looking forward to what you're about to watch today.
[time=61] Mitchell, it's great to have you here.
[time=62] - It's great to be here.
[time=63] Thank you so much.
[time=64] - You're very, very, very welcome.
[time=67] I wanna talk to you all.
[time=68] I want you to just kind of look in today on a little conversation between Mitch and myself.
[time=73] We're here because of Restoration Road.
[time=76] Today you'll see what was the book release ceremony here at Black Hawk.
[time=81] We were so thankful to have Mitch come, thankful for him to preach and talk to us about Restoration Road and the great truths of scripture.
[time=90] They're really the underpinnings of the book.
[time=93] We had a fantastic morning of worship.
[time=95] And before I have him talk about the book and the message of Restoration just for a minute, tell me, Mitch, when you think about coming back to Black Hawk.
[time=105] When you think about this family and the role God had us play, which it was a privilege for us.
[time=111] When you think about the years of Black Hawk, what are some of the great memories that you have?
[time=115] - Well, there's no question that the greatest memories are those faces who fully surrendered their hearts, their desires and their lives to Christ to Savior and Lord and the literally hundreds that we baptized and symbolizing, saying I'm done with the old and I'm coming up with the new.
[time=134] I'm dead to the old self.
[time=135] I'm coming up with the new self in Christ.
[time=138] And a lot of nights when I can't go to sleep, I just picture the names and the faces and it's just endless and it helps shift my own thought process back from any earthly kingdom to God's kingdom.
[time=151] - Well said.
[time=152] And I've got many, many of the same memories and I want you all to know, so many of you, you know, you tune in week after week and a lot of you are kind enough to shoot me emails and you talk to me at the gas station, the grocery stores.
[time=166] Your encouragement to me is incredible and you're always talking about how much, you know, my energy and my passion for what we're about means to you.
[time=175] I want you all to know that over the years that this man and his passion and his energy and the way he has encouraged me along those lines has meant the world to me.
[time=187] It's made a huge difference in my life and I'm thankful for his friendship.
[time=191] Mitchell, when you think about Restoration Road, before we get to the book, I was thinking today driving in my favorite word, you know it in all of scripture, my favorite principle in all of the Bible, hands down, is the picture of redemption.
[time=207] I think about Gomer, Jose's wife on the auction block and how God says with that redeeming love, he told Jose to go and buy her back.
[time=217] And I love the picture of redemption and it's just not coincidental in all that your favorite words in R and my favorite words in R, so we get to-- - No, it's not two R words.
[time=226] Okay, you can correct me.
[time=228] - No, no, no, no, it's not coincidental.
[time=230] - No, it's not coincidental.
[time=231] Restoration, redemption.
[time=234] I think there's probably some similarities, but talk to the people about the difference between those two words.
[time=238] Well, redemption is an economic term and it means what you said to buy back and there was actually a process, I think it was like a seven-fold process of where someone would buy someone back.
[time=249] Where Paul wrote in 1st Corinthians 6 that we were back at a world record price, there could be no greater price than the God of the universe, providing his likeness himself to die, to live a perfect life and to die and then resurrect and provide his spirit to us.
[time=268] There is no greater price that could ever have been paid and I think so many times we think that God just gave a little, no, God gave all.
[time=277] - Everything. - And you cannot be restored if you have not been redeemed.
[time=282] - Wow.
[time=282] - And restoration is this that happens with this total abandonment of my heart, desires and three resources of life to Christ as Savior and Lord, but also restore, also as teacher.
[time=296] See what I'm saying?
[time=297] And what he does is when we're just like a collector car where the owner brings his car that's a basket case and he hands it to the restore and he says, you know what, I can't, you can't, he surrenders the old.
[time=309] And the first thing the restore does is he takes it apart piece by piece and he begins to restore each individual piece and there's this little I can't, you can that goes on with those and then he puts it all back together and then you know what's gonna happen, it's gonna get worn, torn, faded, dinged, rusted.
[time=327] Well it's the same thing in our own lives.
[time=329] We surrender our old basket case of the life to Christ to restore.
[time=332] He takes us apart piece by piece.
[time=334] We said the big I can't, you can.
[time=336] Now we're saying the little I can't, you can.
[time=338] And then we surrender the new, we surrender the tragedies and the triumphs, even the things that are good that happen.
[time=346] Though we surrender those to Christ the restore and then that worn, torn, tattered, faded issue, we've got to surrender that to him as well, the tragedies.
[time=356] - That's good stuff.
[time=358] That's really good.
[time=359] Hey, I want all of you to know and I'm gonna have Mitch just tell you here real quick.
[time=363] There's a book, there's a workbook material and there's a DVD supplemental material as well.
[time=370] Mitch, the best place for folks watching to be able to go and get those materials.
[time=375] What's the best couple of two ways for them to get their hands on the restoration road set?
[time=382] - Go to MitchCruise.com or therestorationroad.com and you'll find the links to Amazon where you can get the book, the study guide and the DVD.
[time=390] And on therestorationroad.com we would also encourage you to upload your story of restoration.
[time=398] Just click on the site, click on stories and get your eye cam going.
[time=402] - Awesome.
[time=403] Hey, thanks.
[time=404] - Thank you so much.
[time=405] - Thank you for being here and thank you for tuning in again.
[time=407] I can't wait for you to hear the message today.
[time=409] We're all about restoration here and what a privilege for Mitchell.
[time=414] What a privilege for me to be a part of God's restoring work.
[time=418] And as always, we wanna hear from you.
[time=420] We hope today is an encouragement to you and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=424] (audience applauds) - Thank you just for old times' sake.
[time=433] Hi, I'm Mitch.
[time=436] - Hi, Mitch.
[time=437] - You still got it.
[time=438] I tell you what, it's really just moving in my heart
[time=444] to look out and see the faces of the hearts and the lives that we just got to walk so much this road together
[time=455] and the ups and the downs.
[time=458] And those of you who I prayed with the fully surrender your lives to Christ, to save your Lord and restore, it's just amazing to come back and see your faces and to get caught up.
[time=470] My prayer today would be that you would allow God
[time=476] into your heart and that you would allow him to kind of just bring up any sand or stone that's in there in resistance to him and that you would allow him to make it clay, soft and malleable in the hands of the potter.
[time=496] So could we pray that?
[time=497] God, I just thank you for who you are and that you saw fit to bring each person on this scene of events now and you all of our stories together.
[time=506] And now, God, as we listen, as we open your word,
[time=512] I just pray, God, that you would reveal the heart and the identity of the restore to us today.
[time=518] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=521] Well, Susan and I take, by the way, here are my girls.
[time=526] Would you stand up?
[time=527] Susie, are you upset if I do that?
[time=529] It's a little late to ask, isn't it?
[time=531] Would you stand up?
[time=532] Look at my beautiful babies.
[time=534] Will you stand up, girls?
[time=536] (audience applauds)
[time=542] Go ahead and stay standing up.
[time=543] I want, I'm joking.
[time=545] Sorry. (audience laughs) Susan and I try to take an anniversary trip every year and several years ago, we were at Nassau at the airport ready to leave after a week of fun in the sun and we're talking a little bit.
[time=560] We got there earlier than normal and I write about this in Restoration Road, by the way and we heard the first announcement for a flight back home.
[time=570] So we got in line with the crowd and kind of moved with the crowd, turned the corner, go down a hallway and went through a gate down a jetway off to our destination.
[time=584] We took the last two seats that happened to match our boarding passes on the aircraft and I wanted how everybody boarded so quickly, but while we were there, we're getting everything put away and I was getting an American Airlines blue vibe
[time=600] not a Delta blue vibe.
[time=602] And then I saw out of the corner of my eye a flight attendant with, rather than a letter from the Greek alphabet, it was two A's flanked by wings and if my eyes were deceiving me, my ears weren't because this is what we heard.
[time=620] - Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank you.
[time=623] Please take your seats at best, your seat belts for an on-time departure to Miami.
[time=629] We were going to Cincinnati, so I'm not telling you, I grab, I can't you, I grab Susan, we jump up, we grab our bags and we sprint off that airplane, we run up the jetway, we go out the gate and we start heading for the correct aircraft, but I learned something.
[time=646] In a post 9/11 world, airport security
[time=652] doesn't take kindly to people who get on airplanes and run off them.
[time=655] (audience laughing) You might say we were arrested.
[time=662] And I was searched in more ways than I care to imagine.
[time=668] The more that I told them, I might miss my flight, the more they found another zipper to unzip in a duffel bag or a suitcase.
[time=675] And then pretty soon they let Blondie go, just you go.
[time=679] I said, what?
[time=681] And she got on the plane without me.
[time=683] (audience laughing) And I'm talking to my head sweating, I'm trying to get there and finally they let me go and I ran to the right gate and there she was, all comfortable in her seat and we're on our way home.
[time=694] Two gates, two different roads,
[time=700] two completely different destinations.
[time=703] Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount that the way we approach life with God, we go through one or two gates, traveling one or two roads, arriving at two totally different destinations.
[time=718] One is from the outside in and it's religious.
[time=723] If I go somewhere and do something, I will be somebody.
[time=727] The other is from the inside out, it's relational.
[time=733] Who I am designed to be in Christ determines what I'm designed to do, which determines where I'm designed to go.
[time=739] Jesus said the first gate is wide.
[time=743] And what he's referencing, if you was studying the Sermon on the Mount, you know contextually what he's getting at, this is Matthew 7, 13 and 14, he's saying that's outside in righteousness of the Pharisees, that's, you know what, I'm gonna take control of my own life and I'm gonna get things looking good on the outside and that'll change me on the inside.
[time=762] And Jesus said, you know what, that's just ridiculous.
[time=768] That's self restoration.
[time=770] He actually said in Matthew 23, you dress up the outside and you look like you're restored.
[time=776] But on the inside, you're just pretending.
[time=779] It's nothing but hypocrisy, you're an actor.
[time=782] And Jesus said that road is broad.
[time=788] A broad road 2,000 years ago was 24 feet wide, it led to the main city gates and the Pharisees had added with their outside in righteousness, they had added 1500 rules, regulations and stipulations to the Old Testament, 613 laws.
[time=805] They were gonna get it right on the outside, thinking it would change the inside.
[time=809] But that broad road is the sinful nature.
[time=817] I will go with my desires.
[time=820] I will seek the satisfaction of my desires apart from gods.
[time=824] And then Romans five through eight, eight rather, Romans chapter eight versus five through eight, I think it's gonna come on the screens.
[time=832] It's amazing what it says, what Paul wrote.
[time=835] He said those who live according to the sinful nature have their mindset on what that nature desires.
[time=843] But those who live in accordance with the spirit capitalist, have their mindset on what the spirit desires.
[time=851] The mind of simple man is death.
[time=854] The mind of simple man is death, but the mind controlled by the spirit capitalist is life and peace.
[time=863] The simple mind is hostile to God.
[time=869] It does not submit or bend the knees to God's law, nor can it do so.
[time=876] Those controlled by the simple nature cannot please God.
[time=882] So the gate is wide, it's the Pharisees outside in righteousness, the road is broad, it's being led by our simple nature, pursuing the satisfaction of our desires apart from Christ.
[time=893] And then the destination Jesus said is destruction.
[time=896] It's outside the kingdom of heaven.
[time=898] On this side, if that's the case, the next.
[time=903] And every time that we try to do that, outside in righteousness, that self restoration attempt that we all need restoration.
[time=911] So one thing we all get since Genesis three.
[time=913] We're get led by our sinful desires and we're who's boss, we're seeking the satisfaction of those apart from Christ.
[time=922] Every time we do that, we die a little bit inside.
[time=924] And Jesus said, you know what, many are going through that gate and traveling that road and arriving at that destination of destruction.
[time=933] They are traveling desperation road.
[time=935] And it's the proud and heart, those who are hard in heart.
[time=939] Stone hearts who try to focus vertically on God at the expense of the horizontal of people, at the end that's religion.
[time=947] And a stone takes a severe tool to be restored, to be shaped.
[time=951] Sand hearts who kind of focus on the horizontal at the expense of the vertical, they don't want God to have anything to do with them.
[time=958] But ironically, you know, it's kind of like loose and licentious scattered in the wind, but ironically stone and sand are the very same substance.
[time=964] Just a different aggregate.
[time=965] Sand has just broken up pieces of stone.
[time=967] Even people are loose and licentious.
[time=969] They got rules, they got what they're doing, man.
[time=971] They got some regulations and stipulations.
[time=975] But God desires a picture of the cross.
[time=978] The master key that unlocks a new and satisfied life of authenticity and divides, he wants us to live in that sweet spot where the vertical intersects with the horizontal where we would have a heart of clay.
[time=990] We bring God into every single situation in our lives.
[time=995] And he would shape us to look like him.
[time=998] But Jesus said, you know what?
[time=1000] There's another gate and it's narrow.
[time=1004] Meaning there's one and it's Christ.
[time=1006] Jesus said, I'm the gate.
[time=1008] And because it's Christ, it's Christ's inside out righteousness.
[time=1011] It begins in our heart, it beats through our desires and it reaches the three resources of our lives.
[time=1016] Our time, our talent and our treasures.
[time=1018] So it's not our righteousness, it's the righteousness of another capital A, it's the righteousness of Christ.
[time=1024] And then we travel a narrow road, Jesus said.
[time=1030] A narrow road 2,000 years ago was six feet wide and arrived at a private entrance.
[time=1035] He's describing a personal relationship with his spirit, capital S.
[time=1041] So the wide gate was outside in righteousness, the narrow gate is Christ, the broad road is being led by our sinful nature.
[time=1050] The narrow road is being led by the spirit of Christ.
[time=1052] Look what Paul wrote as he continues in Romans eight verses nine through 11.
[time=1056] This is amazing.
[time=1058] Romans eight verses nine through 11.
[time=1060] This is the same passage we just had on the screen and Paul's gonna continue with this.
[time=1064] You, however, oh, I don't want you to miss this.
[time=1072] You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature, but by the spirit of the restore, capital S.
[time=1079] If the spirit of God lives in you, and if anyone does not have the spirit of Christ,
[time=1089] the restore, he does not belong to Christ.
[time=1092] But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin.
[time=1098] Yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness, the righteousness of another.
[time=1104] And if the spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life.
[time=1113] Abundant and eternal to your mortal bodies through his spirit who lives vibrantly in you.
[time=1120] So gate is narrow, there's only one, it's Christ.
[time=1124] And a narrow gate 2000 years ago was from the inside out.
[time=1128] It was on the inside, your heart.
[time=1130] The road is narrow, it's a relationship with the spirit and the destination is life.
[time=1134] Abundant and eternal, zoe, vitality of life, abundant and eternal.
[time=1140] Jesus said, I came so that you may have life and have it to the full.
[time=1143] And Jesus said, if you find it, you know who it is?
[time=1147] It's the humble clay hearts.
[time=1148] It's those who fully surrender their hearts, their desires and their lives to Christ to Savior, Lord and restore.
[time=1156] So I didn't want you to just hear the word today.
[time=1163] I wanted you to experience the restore and the life of another.
[time=1167] So I've brought with me a friend, I'd like you to please welcome Mackenzie Dick.
[time=1171] (audience applauds)
[time=1177] - Mackenzie, how are you?
[time=1180] - Good, how are you?
[time=1182] - Good, you survived first hour?
[time=1184] - Barely.
[time=1184] - She said barely.
[time=1186] It's been a little bit overwhelming and you're gonna learn her story a little bit and see why.
[time=1192] Mackenzie, you wanna tell everybody where you're from?
[time=1196] You can leave it there, you can grab it.
[time=1201] Why don't you grab it?
[time=1206] I lost my hair doing that, so be careful.
[time=1211] (audience laughs) - Okay, well, I'm Mackenzie Dick and I am a modern man
[time=1220] and I'm a senior at Lakewood Park Christian School, which is a modern man.
[time=1226] - And that's how we know each other.
[time=1227] All my girls either go or have gone there and I'm just a dad who helps coach a little bit.
[time=1234] I did chapels last year and we connected through a player I coached who was a year ahead of Mackenzie and happened to graduate and Chelsea would come to me and talk to me about, hey, can you talk to this friend or that friend and I took this approach with Chelsea and said, Chelsea, you have the gift of ministry.
[time=1252] You're gonna be a physician someday.
[time=1254] I said, I wanna help you rather equip and release the Spirit of the Restore through you and I'll just kinda guide you.
[time=1260] And then, you know, if there's ever a situation and you want me to get involved, you know, I can, but let me try to coach you.
[time=1267] Just like we coach in basketball, I wanna try to coach you here.
[time=1270] And she said, great, she did that, but she called me one night and said, coach, I wanna have somebody call you.
[time=1276] It's a friend of mine.
[time=1277] I know you always said, you know, you'll coach me to help others, but I'm five hours away now and it's getting important and I wanna know if she can call you.
[time=1285] And I said, well, who, and she said, Mackenzie Dick and I said, sure.
[time=1289] So you called me, it must have been warm weather 'cause it was outside.
[time=1293] We have a taste, a little taste of that today.
[time=1296] - I remember playing phone tag.
[time=1298] - Yes.
[time=1299] - We kept missing each other.
[time=1300] - We did, that's normal.
[time=1302] And you called and you defined your need for restoration.
[time=1307] You wanna tell everybody what we talked about.
[time=1310] - Yeah.
[time=1311] Four years ago, when I was a freshman in high school,
[time=1318] I was diagnosed with an eating disorder and it's called ednaus, which is an acronym for eating disorder, not otherwise specified.
[time=1331] It's not as common as the ones that we normally hear of like bulimia and anorexia.
[time=1338] It's kind of like a messed up, really sad combination of the two.
[time=1345] When normally in bulimia, you can binge up to three, four thousand calories in a sitting and then purge or eject all of the food from your body.
[time=1358] And then with anorexia, you restrict your eating
[time=1364] as much as you can.
[time=1366] And for me, I guess, this isn't a good thing by any means,
[time=1372] I had a lot of control over my habits and at first.
[time=1377] And I would not binge eat.
[time=1383] I would restrict eating as much as I possibly could, but I would still eject the food from my body.
[time=1390] And because I felt that that would make everything happen quicker, there was nothing I wouldn't do to get the results that I thought I needed in order to get the significance that I desired.
[time=1402] - She was searching for the satisfaction of her desires apart from Christ.
[time=1408] So that's what I hear when she's calling me.
[time=1410] I hear a need for restoration and I hear a little bit about the wide, gate, the wide road and the destination of destruction.
[time=1418] See, God created each one of us with a spiritual heart and it has four chambers.
[time=1423] And you can remember in the acronym wise, W, it's the will, I intellect, S, the chamber of the spirit, E, the chamber of the emotions.
[time=1434] The will is the chamber of our choices.
[time=1436] The intellect is the mind or the chamber of our thoughts.
[time=1440] S is the spirit, it is the chamber or the lead chamber of our prayers.
[time=1444] And the emotions are chamber of our feelings.
[time=1447] And then our hearts beat with four primary desires that I think God gave us at creation.
[time=1452] It's Genesis 127 to 30.
[time=1455] Two S words, two C words.
[time=1457] S significance has the word sign in it.
[time=1461] We got that by being created in God's image.
[time=1464] We were created in God's image.
[time=1465] We were to be a sign of God.
[time=1468] And that's where we get our desire for significance.
[time=1471] The second S word is security.
[time=1474] And it came from being given by God, every fruit-bearing tree, every seed-bearing plant, everything that we needed to live.
[time=1484] And then the two C words, the first one is control.
[time=1488] Came from being empowered by God.
[time=1490] You rule over the earth.
[time=1491] You name the animals.
[time=1493] And then contentment from being blessed by God.
[time=1497] So significant security, control, contentment.
[time=1500] Contentment being blessed by God.
[time=1502] And that, it says God blessed them.
[time=1505] And he said, subdue the earth, be fruitful and multiply.
[time=1510] Subdue the earth, subdue in Hebrew is kabosh.
[time=1513] We have made kabosh a negative word.
[time=1515] Hey, he put the kabosh on that.
[time=1517] But kabosh is actually a positive word.
[time=1519] It's to bring contentment to the earth.
[time=1521] And we need to be blessed in essence, be content enough from that blessing to multiply, to give, to be generous.
[time=1529] And so what happens is, is what Mackenzie just said, is we pursue the satisfaction of those desires when we walk that broad road of being led by the sinful nature apart from God.
[time=1540] And the irony is, the more we pursue significance apart from God, the more insignificant we become.
[time=1546] The more we pursue security apart from God, the more insecure we become.
[time=1550] The more we pursue control apart from God, the more out of control our lives become.
[time=1557] And the more we pursue contentment apart from him, the more discontent we become.
[time=1562] And so that's what I see in Mackenzie.
[time=1565] And I realize that that's a desperation road and it's gonna lead to destruction.
[time=1569] And you're gonna die inside a little bit every time you do that.
[time=1572] And there's a hard, hard in there.
[time=1574] A little bit of sand, a little bit of stone.
[time=1576] So we agreed, we had an appointment and we met at school in the sanctuary and what happened there.
[time=1583] You can say self-restoration now.
[time=1593] Yeah.
[time=1593] We're, she's asking me where, at what point of the journey, where she is at the need for restoration is what we saw in the initial encounter.
[time=1605] And then what started happening here in the sanctuary where we're in our first meeting is I realized all these self-restoration attempts that she's been making.
[time=1612] Well, like Mick said, I mean,
[time=1621] if it's true that the more we pursue security, the more insecure we come and we become and the more we pursue significance, the less significant we come, then I'm by far the very, very, very insignificant and very insecure because I pursue those things with everything I had.
[time=1646] Freshman year, like I said, when this started becoming a problem, I was in show choir and I was having a hard time with all the girls.
[time=1661] Like I've, the best way I can say it is,
[time=1667] I wanted to be the S.
[time=1669] E-S-T.
[time=1671] E-S-T, the S.
[time=1672] The S.
[time=1673] What's that mean?
[time=1674] Of something.
[time=1675] Even if it's not a good thing or something you really wanna be the S of, I guess I had this desire when I looked around at all the other girls.
[time=1688] I wasn't the tallest.
[time=1690] I wasn't the shortest.
[time=1693] I wasn't the best singer.
[time=1699] I wasn't the best or looked at as anything significant.
[time=1704] I was just another member of the choir and that killed me because I saw all these girls who had this E-S-T added to some adjective and I wanted that and that became everything to me.
[time=1721] And I thought, well, it's really hard to change my voice.
[time=1725] It's really hard to change the way I dance.
[time=1730] The only thing that I could really think of that I had control over, at least so I thought, was my eating habits.
[time=1739] I thought, maybe I can't be this or this or this plus S, but I could be the smallest or the lightest or the petite-est and I saw that became my mission to restore myself and give myself significance
[time=1761] and it consumed everything in my mind.
[time=1769] It, I became obsessed and
[time=1778] and the thing that I originally thought
[time=1798] that I could control and because I told God, I was very at odds with God at this point and I told him, you may think that you can control everything.
[time=1813] You can control the universe and everything else but you can't control what I do to myself.
[time=1820] That's terrible.
[time=1823] And I thought that I could control this, I couldn't and my habits became to control me,
[time=1836] the thing that I was so sure that I could control.
[time=1843] - I want you to hear that because wherever you are today, however God brought you here today, whatever state your heart's in, I want to ask you that question, what about you?
[time=1857] What are you trying to controlling?
[time=1860] What are you trying to control that in the end is controlling you?
[time=1864] What are you trying to control in your life right now and in the end it's actually controlling you?
[time=1875] Because it's sand or it's stone and it's another self restoration attempt that's gonna leave you unrestored and dissatisfied.
[time=1885] So we met in the school four year, I gave you a personality test so you could begin to look on the inside and I wrote a little three little pictures for you on that test and you want to tell them what those were?
[time=1898] - Yeah, the three pictures were three pairs of glasses
[time=1904] and they represented the three perspectives that we have the option of, you know, - Seeing ourselves. - Seeing ourselves.
[time=1916] And the first pair, I remember were the rose colored glasses
[time=1922] which was half partly what I was seeing myself through and it was distorted.
[time=1931] I was looking at myself and thinking that I was a nobody and that I was huge and I was not EST of anything and it was just completely distorted.
[time=1950] And the other view is the other perspective
[time=1957] I saw myself with was how others saw me.
[time=1961] I became obsessed with that perspective.
[time=1964] All I wanted was, and I know we can all identify with this, you just want to be seen as significant to somebody
[time=1975] and we often, I often, I just become obsessed with how others are interpreting everything I do and how I look and it's huge.
[time=1989] And then there's the third perspective which is the biggest and most important and the one that changes your life completely.
[time=1998] And I think that you can articulate it better.
[time=2001] - I don't know if I can but you're doing pretty well.
[time=2006] The third set of glasses and so we have the clouded vision of my perspective, the clouded vision of others perspective but we have the crystal clear vision, the 2020 vision of the God of the universe.
[time=2018] And so we need to begin to see ourselves as God sees us and I remember in my own life, on my own journey on Restoration Road, how that one idea just radically transformed so much in my life because I was looking through the distorted glasses of myself and others and I realized that there was a whole different perspective.
[time=2035] It began my pursuit of the study of the Bible to learn more about that, about his perspective.
[time=2040] So we met again, I asked you, you know, are you ready to surrender your life to Christ?
[time=2045] You said no.
[time=2046] And we met again and I learned more about your self-reservation attempts and you didn't wanna change, you wanna say why?
[time=2054] - Yeah, I didn't wanna change my habits.
[time=2059] I didn't wanna surrender what I was doing to myself because that meant changing everything that I had made for myself and my own mind.
[time=2069] I don't think other people, 'cause not a lot of people were aware but now, so not many people probably saw me this way.
[time=2079] This is the rose color glasses.
[time=2082] But I saw myself and I built for myself this identity of I defined myself by my habits.
[time=2091] What I was doing to myself, the purging,
[time=2099] the restricting, the hurting of my body was, like I said, I became obsessed, it was everything.
[time=2111] It's all I thought about and I considered it and almost all my decisions and conversations and it just consumed everything.
[time=2123] And so if I surrendered that to Christ,
[time=2129] what would I have to define myself?
[time=2131] - I want you to hear the weight of those words,
[time=2137] my identity came from the wide gate and the wide road of being led by a simple desire, self-restoration attempts.
[time=2148] She just said it, if I thought if I would go somewhere and do something, I would be somebody, be his identity.
[time=2155] And I just kinda tell you today, if that's you then that's where you are in any way, any part of your life, any part of your heart, any part of your desires, that is a lie from Satan.
[time=2165] God has designed us to live life from the inside out and we will never experience restoration unless we fully surrender our heart, our desires and our three resources of life are time, talent and treasure to him.
[time=2179] So we ended up in the foyer in a third meeting and I ask you my question again, after we identified a little more, saying a little more so and I said, are you ready to fully surrender your heart, your life, your three resources of life to him, would you choose to think to, pray to and want to?
[time=2196] And you were ready to change, do you know why?
[time=2199] - As I've thought about it,
[time=2205] I'm not sure, but I just know that it was not me
[time=2217] it was not anything that I did for myself.
[time=2220] I don't know why because the day before our last meeting was, I was so set against it.
[time=2229] I wouldn't even consider and I wouldn't even, I wouldn't even think about, like I was so sure I wasn't going to surrender because I didn't want to lie, like even though I was at odds with God, I didn't want to lie and say I'd surrender then not really do it.
[time=2247] So, the fact that I was willing to surrender meant that I really wanted to because I didn't want to lie and I know that didn't come from anything inside myself
[time=2262] because I'm not that strong.
[time=2265] No, it was completely God.
[time=2273] So, we had that moment of full surrender that I prayed with many of you.
[time=2278] You can almost sense the tangible presence of God.
[time=2283] And she surrendered her heart, her desires, her life to Christ is Savior and Lord and is restored.
[time=2290] And I gave her a life application Bible, I love it, I love the commentary that's in it so she could always have like somebody there discipling her as she would go.
[time=2299] And I knew she needed an individual 'cause there was a limit to what I could do.
[time=2303] And I hooked her up, I just gotta tell you a little bit about how God orchestrated this.
[time=2307] I had been made aware by Chelsea that Mackenzie was coming my way before Mackenzie ever talked to me and I thought I gotta find a woman who's farther down the road than she is who can disciple her but it was sure it would be great if there was some kind of a medical experience in this woman.
[time=2324] And through the volleyball season, I end up sitting by a parent a lot who was a parent of a player on my daughter's team and was Dr. Lynn Fauer, she's a physician and I found her to be just, I asked her one time, I said, "Where did you get your Bible knowledge?" And she said, "I had a good teacher a long time ago "in a church and it's just continued in me "that I have a thirst for it "but I don't see myself that way at all." And I thought, "Wow." Well, I knew all that, I had that relationship before I knew about Mackenzie and then when I knew this might happen, I thought, "You know, I gotta ask Dr. Fauer "if she would be available to do this "before I ever even breathe a word of that to Mackenzie "if she ever calls me." So we're at Fremont at a volleyball tournament and I asked Dr. Fauer, "Hey, the situation might be coming my way.
[time=2378] "Have you ever thought about making yourself available?
[time=2380] "I know you're busy, we're crazy hours.
[time=2382] "Have you ever thought about making yourself available "to invest in the life of a high school student?
[time=2386] "Here's kind of the scenario of what's coming." And she broke down and cried.
[time=2391] And I thought, "Oh my goodness, what'd I say?" And she said, "Mitchell, I've been praying for this "for weeks, maybe months, that God would use me "to invest in somebody who needed it.
[time=2404] "I would love it if it were a student." And she said, "I was dropping my daughter off today "and I had to leave to go take care of something else "and God made me go in there." And I said, "God, what are you doing?" She was sensing this presence of God and she began to cry and she felt crazy, you know?
[time=2418] And she went and she goes, "Now I know why." So what has that relationship been like?
[time=2426] You met weekly, right, you meet on Mondays?
[time=2428] - Yeah, I look forward to Monday, incredibly.
[time=2433] It has been one of the biggest blessings in my entire life.
[time=2439] Just to have that time, I'm almost certain
[time=2446] that if I didn't have her that I wouldn't, I wouldn't have been able to do it.
[time=2457] I wouldn't have been able to surrender because it's a constant thing.
[time=2462] It's not something you just do.
[time=2464] You don't just surrender your life to Christ and then it just gets better and then you're done.
[time=2470] It's a constant reminder that I need and it's daily, it's hourly, but I mean, just to have that weekly time with her, I can't even say how much it means to me.
[time=2487] - You're quoting Paul in Galatians.
[time=2489] You are very spirit-led at the moment, I might add.
[time=2492] Well, it wasn't easy.
[time=2494] You scored your first goal and I think it was the next game or maybe thereafter you had an injury and you weren't very happy about it.
[time=2502] - Yeah, the soccer season was really tough this year for me in particular because my eating disorder
[time=2513] was getting really out of hand this year to the point where I couldn't perform as well as I would have liked to in soccer.
[time=2525] There are a lot of times I couldn't play to the best of my ability because the physical consequences of what I was doing to myself was getting really bad.
[time=2536] - I want you to realize for those of you who don't, I know many of you do, but for those of you who don't, she was not just dying on the inside, Mackenzie was physically dying, Mackenzie was dying on the outside.
[time=2546] - I could just feel my body shutting down and if any of you have ever experienced it, then you know what I'm talking about.
[time=2553] And if you don't then understand that it's nothing short of just slowly dying.
[time=2560] You can feel it.
[time=2562] But I was, I hurt myself at a game and I hurt my knee and it was popping a lot.
[time=2572] But I didn't, it was painful,
[time=2579] but we had had a lot of injuries on the team this year and I felt like my pain, it was one of those injuries where it doesn't, it hurts so much that it really hinders your running, but it doesn't hurt enough for you to like in good conscience sit out when you know your team needs you.
[time=2600] And so I was, I tried to play on senior night and it wasn't working out and so I had to sit out and I just felt like I really let my team down and that really discouraged me.
[time=2614] And I thought, I just surrendered my life like yesterday.
[time=2618] It wasn't supposed to get better from here.
[time=2622] And so I was really upset and sorry, Donna.
[time=2627] All right, so afterwards, my youth group leader
[time=2636] and one of my friends wanted to meet at Starbucks to read the Bible and just go through our weeks and accountability time basically.
[time=2646] And so I was like, okay, we'll meet at Starbucks and I was still incredibly discouraged.
[time=2653] I drove into the parking lot and I did not get out of my car and instead I just started screaming
[time=2664] and crying hysterically and saying things that are really, really hurtful towards God.
[time=2672] I was saying anything you could think of, I called God.
[time=2677] I am so glad that he forgives me.
[time=2681] I can't even articulate.
[time=2685] But as I was so upset and my youth group leader and my friend was in my car with me, they didn't say a word the whole time, I wouldn't let them.
[time=2696] I was so busy saying I hated God and that I told God that he doesn't exist which, as I said, makes absolutely no sense.
[time=2708] But I looked over at my passenger seat.
[time=2716] Should I tell him now?
[time=2717] - Go ahead.
[time=2718] - This part.
[time=2720] I looked over at my passenger seat and Mitch's Bible that he gave me, it was a study Bible and it's really nice and I love it.
[time=2732] - Yes it is.
[time=2732] - I love that Bible very much now but at the time,
[time=2739] my anger got ahold of me and I chucked it out the window.
[time=2744] - Was the car running and like going when you threw it out the window?
[time=2750] - It was running and-- - You threw my Bible out the window.
[time=2753] - Yeah.
[time=2754] - While the car's driving.
[time=2757] - I might have backed over.
[time=2759] - I'm standing at, what?
[time=2760] (audience laughs) Did you say that again?
[time=2764] - I backed over it.
[time=2765] - You backed over the Bible?
[time=2766] - As soon as I felt the bump, I stopped.
[time=2769] - Okay.
[time=2772] - 'Cause I think at that time when I was just like, something hit me and I was like, oh my gosh, I just drew through the incarnate word of God out the window.
[time=2786] I go to scripture and I just had the first pang of guilt I'd had in a while.
[time=2794] And so I got out and I bent down and I picked it up and I brushed the pavement off of it and put it back in my car and I looked over, 'cause I was ashamed 'cause I just made this dramatic statement and then I looked over at my youth group leader and my friend and they're just like, Kenzie, you would.
[time=2820] And so I just kind of didn't look and I just drove away with my head down 'cause I was pretty ashamed of what I just did.
[time=2830] And that was that.
[time=2833] - So soon after that, you had a car accident.
[time=2837] I got a call, you ever have one of those calls where the cell phone, the ID and then time, they don't match, this person wouldn't call me at this time unless something was wrong.
[time=2846] And that's what it was, it was Pastor Claire Jewel and it was midnight.
[time=2850] And I knew it was gonna be bad, so I almost didn't answer and I answered and he says, Mitch, Mackenzie's been in a car accident and she's paralyzed.
[time=2858] And I thought, oh God, did you allow this girl to surrender her heart or desire her life to you to have her be paralyzed?
[time=2868] And then there was a question of, it was a little uncertainty vague in the information that maybe she wasn't gonna make it.
[time=2874] She had hit a tree, totaled the car.
[time=2876] And we learned later that it happened sometimes.
[time=2879] I went down in the emergency room, walked in there, found out her whole class was praying for her on Facebook.
[time=2883] Some of them had actually made it there and her feeling had been restored back to all of her body and we had some chances there to talk and pray a little bit.
[time=2893] She entered the Misty Cal contest about that same time.
[time=2898] She won Miss Congeniality and a judge told her something that I'm gonna tell you because she's uncomfortable.
[time=2904] She doesn't want you to take any of this and say, hey, look what I did.
[time=2908] She doesn't want you to think that about her.
[time=2909] She wants you to see it as, hey, look what God did.
[time=2912] So she prefers it.
[time=2913] I describe what happened.
[time=2914] A judge actually said to her in an interview where they're firing questions at her.
[time=2917] She said, you know what?
[time=2919] Talking about the God thing doesn't work for a lot of people because there's a whole lot of pretending.
[time=2924] She says, but you know what?
[time=2926] You need to go with it because it's authentic.
[time=2928] (audience applauds)
[time=2934] Mackenzie would also want you to know that it's been two steps forward, one step back.
[time=2940] It's been two steps forward, one step back.
[time=2945] But her desire has changed.
[time=2947] And she desires the heart of Christ and you're gonna go to college at Iowa maybe and major in psychology, right?
[time=2956] - That's what I'm hoping for.
[time=2958] - Mackenzie wrote a poem.
[time=2962] That I'd like you to just kind of hit the pause button on your life and block everything out and just listen to these words because when I read them for the first time they were probably the most powerful, some of the most powerful words ever written by human hand.
[time=2975] And I just wouldn't buy it and maybe even close your eyes as you listen.
[time=2980] - But before I do, I just, I didn't really get to say this.
[time=2984] It's, maybe I did say this, but it's really hard.
[time=2991] I'm not all the way anywhere.
[time=2994] I still struggle all the time.
[time=2998] So I just, I don't want to say that just because, I mean, this is all, you know, months ago, but even now it still hurts and it's still hard.
[time=3010] But the fact that God changed my heart and the fact that He's with me every day and He's constantly, I'm constantly surrendering.
[time=3018] I'm constantly having to give up things and desires and He's constantly having to force me to stay out of the bathroom and do things.
[time=3032] And the fact that He's, it's every day and it's still today.
[time=3037] And I just want to say that it's a road.
[time=3044] It's a long road.
[time=3049] But I'll read now.
[time=3051] Okay.
[time=3053] I hope I don't cry.
[time=3057] Sometimes I cry.
[time=3058] It's called God was still there.
[time=3062] - We're ready.
[time=3067] (audience laughs) - For real?
[time=3070] - I'll need it.
[time=3071] - She sat in her car with her fists in the air.
[time=3078] She screamed, God, I don't love you.
[time=3081] And I know you're not there.
[time=3084] She hardened her heart.
[time=3085] She let Satan inside.
[time=3088] Her faith became smaller until it withered and it died.
[time=3092] She prayed for love.
[time=3096] She prayed for healing.
[time=3098] But she felt all of her prayers just brushed the ceiling.
[time=3102] Her burden was heavy.
[time=3105] It was too much to bear.
[time=3107] She thought she was alone.
[time=3109] But God was still there.
[time=3111] Weeks went by.
[time=3116] The devil's grip was still tight.
[time=3120] And her car took a turn for the worst one night.
[time=3124] She laid in her hospital bed, hurting and scared.
[time=3132] But God was still withered.
[time=3139] In one day, everything changed.
[time=3144] God had other plans.
[time=3146] He let her know.
[time=3149] He would never let go.
[time=3153] And that her life was in his hands.
[time=3158] He took her fears.
[time=3161] He dried her tears.
[time=3163] And he showed her that he can't.
[time=3167] He changed her view.
[time=3169] And he made her new.
[time=3172] And now she'll never doubt it again.
[time=3175] And God is still there.
[time=3179] (audience applauding)
[time=3185] - Let's pray.
[time=3195] We're gonna sing about amazing grace.
[time=3197] I married love, undeserved favor.
[time=3202] And I just, God, I just pray that whatever's going on inside the hearts of people here today, that they would have the opportunity to surrender to you, to bend the knees of their heart and say, I can't, God, you can.
[time=3218] I can't restore myself.
[time=3224] I can't free myself from the penalty or the power of sin, but God in Christ, you can.
[time=3228] And like that classic car owner that renders his car basket case of the life, the old of the restore, we can send her a basket case of a life to you right now, right here, right in this moment as your presence is here.
[time=3244] And you'll begin a life of taking our,
[time=3250] those pieces apart and restoring them one by one and assembling us.
[time=3255] And we resurrender that those dings to rust, the scrapes.
[time=3261] We surrender the new, the tragedy and the triumphs
[time=3267] and say, so God, I just pray.
[time=3268] For every single person that you prayed for here in this room when you walk the earth, that they would experience full surrender today, they would choose to think to, pray to and want to right now.
[time=3285] And that would be like Mackenzie said, it would not be of ourselves that we would say, look, look what I did, but we would know that it was only of God.
[time=3294] And pray this in Jesus name, amen.
[time=3301] So whatever posture you need to take right now is false things.
[time=3305] Whether you wanna come here and pray with Steve, Kelly or me, whether you just wanna have your head down and palms lifted up as a sign of surrender, whether you need to stand, whatever you need to do, I want you to experience the power of the restore today like Mackenzie did.
[time=3323] [MUSIC - 202 seconds]
