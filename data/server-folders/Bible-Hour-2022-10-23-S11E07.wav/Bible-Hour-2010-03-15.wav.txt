[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - It's good for us to see and sense God at work.
[time=35] We sent out, I sent on a note a couple months ago, and we had 30, 40 people respond, and they were willing to come in and just sit in the studio with us, and just real quick, just tape a real kind of quick snippet.
[time=47] How's God growing you as a disciple?
[time=50] We asked them.
[time=52] And when you look around Blackhawk, what are you encouraged by?
[time=54] Just two simple questions.
[time=56] And I wanted to give you a chance this morning, you'll see it on the website here soon, you'll see it on our Facebook page, you'll see it here in the service periodically.
[time=64] We've captured all these stories, and we're just gonna share 'em with you periodically, and I'm so thankful.
[time=69] Watch this, be encouraged.
[time=72] Be very encouraged about what God is doing in our midst.
[time=75] Take a look, Blackhawk Stories.
[time=77] (upbeat music)
[time=84] - Well, I've been walking with a Lord for a lot of years, not always in the space things I like, but at this point in my life, I have really been re-energized and re-enthused for whatever the next phase of my journey is, that the really strong biblical teaching I've received has been a blessing.
[time=99] There's very few Sundays when I don't go home.
[time=102] I have something to really chew around on, to follow up on, and I can feel myself growing and continuing closer, and that's been a real blessing.
[time=115] I'd say recently, I think God has been showing me through the gatherings and also with connecting with a small group that I need to get out of the way.
[time=127] I tend to internalize a lot of things, and when I do that, that blocks me from a lot of the relationships that I can be building, but just in recent messages, especially this last weekend,
[time=142] just about connecting with other believers, like that has been one of my biggest personal challenges just because of myself, my own preconceived notions, my own past experiences, and not looking forward, so.
[time=157] Definitely, the Lord has been showing me that I need to move myself out of the way so he can get his work done.
[time=170] - That would be an easy answer for me, and it would be the people here.
[time=174] We, almost to this day, it has been 26 years
[time=180] since we first accepted Christ, and I can honestly say that I've never been involved in a body of believers, where Christ is truly the focus.
[time=192] We've been involved in some more legalistic or judgmental type settings, but here Christ really seems to be the focus, and that's what I hear as a grader at the front door as well.
[time=204] When people come in, they feel welcome, and they at least express to me a desire to want to be a part of that, and I think that's what is expressed.
[time=218] If you know Christ, then come and worship with us, and if you don't know Christ, then let us tell you about him, and that's what it's all about, and it's very exciting to me.
[time=229] I really sense God doing a work right now in the body.
[time=234] I know he is in our lives, my life.
[time=237] There's just a desire to want to please him, to simplify my life and please and serve him.
[time=242] - I believe, for me personally,
[time=251] and just kind of going along the lines of authenticity, being a minority here, and it not being an awkward thing.
[time=260] It's okay, I look different, my kids look different, and there's nothing, there's no barriers, there's no share your experience as a black member of Black Hawk.
[time=275] Tell us what it's like.
[time=277] It's, hey, Jaren, 'cause that's another thing.
[time=281] I meet different people, I meet the same people, we talk all the time, and it's definitely a large community that connects, and I didn't, when I first came, I didn't feel that I was gonna get that.
[time=292] I went to a smaller church, and it was used to, you know, we know everything about everyone, 'cause church is so small, and coming here, I was like, oh no, there's no way possible I'm gonna be able to get that, and it kinda was, you know, when we first started going here, one foot in the door, one foot out, wasn't really knowing what to expect, but then just kept coming back, kept coming back, and just got to meet more and more people, and seeing that, you know, Black Hawk is a place for me to be who I am, and it's okay.
[time=318] Like, I look different, I do different things, I eat different things, listen to different kind of music, and that's okay.
[time=325] So that's definitely something that Black Hawk, going to Black Hawk has shown me in recent days.
[time=330] Most of my 26 years have been spent around the corner
[time=339] over there in the Black Hawk Christian School, and having done that for 26 years, the one of the most encouraging things is to see people that have gone through Black Hawk, not me necessarily all 12 years, some of them have been here a year, some 12 years, some six months, and you bump into them out the mall, or they send you an email, or somewhere along the line, your paths crossed, you remember me, and then you have a conversation about life and what it's like for them, and for some, it's, you know, things are really going great for some, it's just leveled off.
[time=372] I like to, when you ask me that question, and I've been thinking about that, I feel like I go to over there every day, kind of tending the garden in a way.
[time=384] You do some weeding, you do some watering, you do some pruning.
[time=387] Do you see God doing that, whatever that first Corinthians thing is, where he causes the growth?
[time=392] I don't know, it's like watching a tree grow sometime, you know, you go back out there, and it's the same as it did yesterday, when you come back in five years, it's something significant has really happened, and that's kind of black our Christian school in some way that God has graciously, in spite of our inadequacies, and sometimes outright blatant wrongdoing, he still has made corrections and adjustments, and it's just really encouraging to see people that the Word took root and bore good fruit, and sometimes it didn't kick in until they were out of this place for five years, but God's really used it in a really interesting way to do what he's doing.
[time=435] I'm Bob Freeborn.
[time=438] - I'm Tom Beckner.
[time=440] - I'm Pam Neath.
[time=441] - My name is Jaren Hudson, and I am grateful that God is using Black Hawk to grow me as a disciple.
[time=448] (audience applauds)
[time=455] - It's pretty cool to hear from those mouths what God's doing around here.
[time=459] The next song that we picked to sing, I think is really appropriate.
[time=464] It's titled "To You Be the Glory." And what a great reminder for all of us, that when good things happen in the people of God, God still gets the credit, and he is still the one that's to be glorified, and the one that's supposed to be magnified, and the one that's supposed to be focused on even in the midst of good things happening in his bride, the church.
[time=486] So listen, as the team sings this song.
[time=488] (gentle music)
[time=494] [MUSIC - 217 seconds]
[time=714] - Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=721] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege, as most of you know, of serving on the team here at Black Hawk Ministries and what a team it is.
[time=729] I'm so thankful for the work that our broadcast team does each and every week to bring you the Bible Hour broadcast and to bring with it the encouragement and the help that I know it brings to literally thousands of you in our community.
[time=744] I want you to know the last couple of weeks, it's been an encouragement to me to be able to have my good friend Scott Artevanis.
[time=752] If you'll remember back a couple of weeks, Scott was here to preach and encourage our family and I know he encouraged many of you from the emails that we received.
[time=760] Last week we were able to have Dr. Mitchell Cruz back as we released his new book Restoration Road and it was as always great to have Mitch back in the Black Hawk family for a day.
[time=772] And today what you're gonna see is our, our kind of our re-entry back into the Ephesians study.
[time=779] This study of the book of Ephesians has been significant.
[time=782] It's been life changing for a lot of people as they've started to realize the fact that in these first three chapters of Ephesians God gives us the truth about our salvation, everything he's done, all that he has provided us with.
[time=798] And then as we transition to the next three chapters, chapters four, five and six, we get to see from God's word how to live that salvation out.
[time=807] How does a real genuine true believer actually live out the reality of his faith?
[time=813] And today Steve Webster is gonna take us through an amazing passage in the first part of Ephesians 4.
[time=820] And I wanna encourage you with something I've told you about before.
[time=824] Go to our website when you get a chance.
[time=826] Many of you have done this, but I really think more of you should because I can't tell you what a great resource this is.
[time=832] Go to our website and go down to the Digging Deeper icon.
[time=837] And when you click on Digging Deeper, what that is is a chance for you as the week progresses.
[time=842] You can take what you heard on Sunday and really dig a little deeper into that passage and the teaching that you received.
[time=850] There's questions for you to answer.
[time=852] There's thoughts for you to consider.
[time=854] There's more research that you can do.
[time=856] It's a chance for you to take the message from Sunday and really live with it and think it through and apply it, most important thing, apply it as the week goes on.
[time=867] So go to the website, click on Digging Deeper and be encouraged.
[time=870] I'm so thankful for our Digging Deeper team and what they've provided you.
[time=874] It will encourage you.
[time=875] It will challenge you.
[time=877] It will cement in your hearts and minds the truth from that week's message.
[time=881] And I know if you're like me, you need some help.
[time=884] Come about Wednesday or Thursday.
[time=885] You need some help to finish out the week strong.
[time=888] Hey, God bless you.
[time=889] Thanks for tuning in.
[time=890] Thank you for being a part of our broadcast audience.
[time=893] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=895] Come and visit us anytime and have a great week.
[time=898] (upbeat music)
[time=907] [MUSIC - 80 seconds]
[time=989] (upbeat music)
[time=1017] [MUSIC - 59 seconds]
[time=1078] (upbeat music) (audience applauding) - Man, you always do that to me, Corwin.
[time=1091] I gotta follow something like that every single time.
[time=1094] Wow, thank you.
[time=1096] Ephesians 5, verse 14, "Awayco's sleeper, "and rise from the dead." Christ will shine on you.
[time=1101] Thank you, everybody.
[time=1103] I wanna thank Todd Larsen also for a metaphor, this Ephesians 4, where we'll be this morning, Todd for the metaphor of growth in the body, lots of calories being consumed this morning.
[time=1114] So thank you, Todd, for that.
[time=1115] That was why you did that, by the way, I'm sure, in connection with our time together today.
[time=1119] I have to say, as we pray this morning, that that song, "To God be the Glory,"
[time=1129] a perfect redemption, the purchase of blood, to every believer, the promise of God, the vilest offender who truly believes that moment from Jesus, a pardon, receives.
[time=1143] I am the vilest offender with apologies to you.
[time=1146] I am the vilest offender, and as we pray this morning, I am overwhelmed by God's goodness, by his offer of redemption.
[time=1155] The kind of God that we sang about just a few minutes ago that fills all things that's in our passage and Ephesians 4, the God who fills all things who is majestic and glory, gave the vilest offender a pardon.
[time=1168] He gave me grace.
[time=1170] Grace, by definition, is what I do not receive.
[time=1173] And friends, let's start there this morning.
[time=1176] I don't deserve the good things, the grace, given to each one of us in the body of Christ from him.
[time=1183] I don't deserve that.
[time=1184] If we begin in that place, we're gonna be okay.
[time=1186] If we begin saying, "But God's really lucky to have me here today." All right, it just seems a little weird.
[time=1194] Can we pray that way today?
[time=1195] Let's pray with a sense of humility and bow our heads together and consider what he's done for us.
[time=1201] Oh, Father, today, I am so grateful to have received the pardon that I have needed so desperately, Lord.
[time=1213] Thank you for that morning in September.
[time=1216] 18 years ago, when the vilest offender truly believed, and from your son, Jesus, and because of your son, Jesus received the pardon.
[time=1225] I am overwhelmed.
[time=1226] God, I can only with my dear friends in this room sing your praises and give you all the glory.
[time=1234] God, you have done, you are doing, and you will do great things.
[time=1240] In this place, in us, we are thankful.
[time=1243] We all together, Father, speak this word in conclusion to our prayer in beginning our time together, in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1251] Couple of things just to mention when Jenna brought that crown up to the stage a few minutes ago, we're just a few weeks away from Easter, from Resurrection Sunday.
[time=1262] And the Romans were good at saying to people, if you cross us, if you mess with us, we will humiliate you, we will destroy you, we will make sure that you are an example to the world.
[time=1275] If you mess with the Romans, this is what happens to you.
[time=1278] We'll lift you up on that cross.
[time=1279] Crosses would not have been far away, they would have been in the corner of state in Maple Crest, on a busy, busy public street, crucified about this far off the ground, in a public place, so everybody would see, if you mess with Rome, here's what happens to you.
[time=1293] In Jesus' case, he was accused of being the king of the Jews, and so they put a fake crown on his head to humiliate him, to mock him, to scorn him, to say, you think you're the king of the Jews?
[time=1303] What about now?
[time=1305] And he was lifted up on a cross.
[time=1307] The great beauty of that, friends, as you know, from Philippians two, is that very supposed act of humiliation that leads to Jesus' ultimate exaltation.
[time=1318] And the only thing, the Romans had it all wrong.
[time=1321] They think, we're gonna silence this guy, here's, you think you're the king of the Jews, you're not.
[time=1326] You think you're in charge here, we are.
[time=1329] And that crown of thorns, pressed on his head, and that cross to which they nailed him, was the means of his ultimate exaltation, and it was the means of our redemption.
[time=1339] The Romans just missed it, and I'm so glad that they did.
[time=1342] God is the one in control and in charge of all things.
[time=1345] I spent yesterday, about an hour and 20 minutes west of here at Triton High School, witnessing our voice.
[time=1353] I've had the great privilege of teaching a block of Christian school for seven years, alongside Bob Freeborn.
[time=1358] And I have never been prouder of a group of young men than I am of those guys yesterday.
[time=1363] State quarter finals yesterday came up a little bit short last night, but I'm so grateful just to have been there yesterday.
[time=1370] Would you give a round of applause, please, to our young men?
[time=1372] Many of whom are in the room today.
[time=1374] Guys, thank you.
[time=1375] What a great day.
[time=1380] Hope you were there, many of you were there.
[time=1382] Hope that you were, it was a great, great day.
[time=1385] I was talking to Lori this morning, Lori Whitman about her son Mitch on the team, and I said, "There's a great blessing "of living your life in such a way "that you have no regrets." And those boys can look back yesterday and say, "I gave him my best shot." And they have no regrets moving forward.
[time=1399] As a former teenager, I can say that I look back in those years of my life and say, "I have lots of regrets." And it's a great blessing to look back, at least as far as the young men are concerned with the basketball floor, and to have no regret.
[time=1413] We're gonna be in Ephesians 4 this morning, friends, having said all that.
[time=1416] Ephesians 4 starting in verse 7 today.
[time=1419] I wanna actually jump in in verse 4 with you because the first word of verse 7 is butt.
[time=1425] So what's the butt there for?
[time=1427] Let's look at verses 4 through 6 of Ephesians 4, and then jump in.
[time=1432] There are some notes in your bulletins today.
[time=1435] This passage is about Jesus from beginning to end.
[time=1438] The inexpressible gift of Jesus.
[time=1441] I wanna read with you from that passage in Corinthians to set us up today, but first let's go to Ephesians 4.
[time=1448] There is one body and one spirit,
[time=1454] just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
[time=1471] This is a ferocious expression of the unity of the faith by Paul in Ephesians 4, 4 through 6, but the first word of verse 7 is what?
[time=1484] But grace, verse 7, but grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ's gift.
[time=1493] The first point in your outlines this morning is the gift of Christ.
[time=1498] And I'll make two observations with you from these verses, from the first four chapters of Ephesians, the first observation I'll make is that Christ has given us everything we need.
[time=1508] Remember back in the summer how we talked about how we gave the amen and how you have a hearty response to a truthful thing spoken, let's try again.
[time=1517] Christ has given us everything that we need.
[time=1520] - Amen. - All right, okay.
[time=1522] Everything that we need, look at what it says here, but grace was given to each one of us, each one of us, every one of us, is the recipient of that gift from God in Christ.
[time=1537] According to the measure of Christ's gift, the measure, the measure there, the word for measure is metron.
[time=1544] It's quantity, it's God isn't like throwing stuff off the back of a truck, here you go, here you go, here you go, here you go, here you go, he gives each person a measured gift, a quantity of the gift that he wants them to have, for his own purposes.
[time=1563] Do you see the language in verses four through six, they're about a call?
[time=1567] God doesn't just dial numbers strangely, let's see if this person's gonna pick up, let's go there, let's go that way.
[time=1573] His calling is given, specifically two people, not one, Jesus said that not one of his kids will slip through his fingers.
[time=1581] He knows every one of them by name.
[time=1583] God is a good father, a good father.
[time=1586] I used to get in the car for church and look at, get you kids in the backseat, there's Jody, okay, I'm good.
[time=1591] If I forgot my Bible, that's fine, but I gotta have the two kids with me in the two back seats.
[time=1595] As long as they're in the car, I feel pretty good about things.
[time=1598] God is a good father to his children.
[time=1601] Thank you, Chris.
[time=1604] Can we go to 2 Corinthians nine, just for a moment, about this idea, I wanna set this up this morning, 'cause this idea of growth and giving, 2 Corinthians chapter nine, starting in verse 10, is the place from which this inexpressible gift title comes, the inexpressible gift, this entire passage of Ephesians four, seven to 16, is about Jesus.
[time=1629] It's about Christ from beginning to end.
[time=1632] You're gonna see lots of similarities with this passage to ours from Ephesians four.
[time=1637] Same author in Paul, writing to similar audiences in Corinth and Ephesus, very sophisticated, very cosmopolitan people, okay, listen.
[time=1646] Verse 10, 2 Corinthians chapter nine.
[time=1650] He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness.
[time=1660] You will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, which through us will produce Thanksgiving to God.
[time=1668] For the ministry of this service isn't only supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God.
[time=1677] By their approval of this service, they will glorify God because of your submission, flowing from your confession of the gospel of Christ and the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others.
[time=1689] Paul speaking of a monetary gift here, verse 14.
[time=1692] While they long for you and pray for you because of the surpassing grace of God upon you, thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift.
[time=1705] His indescribable gift, one translation says.
[time=1710] The quantity, verse seven of Ephesians four, we're gonna go back there now.
[time=1716] The quantity and the kind of each gift is not accidental.
[time=1721] God knows exactly what he's doing with his body, with his family.
[time=1725] We're called to one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God, one father of all, but the first word of verse seven is but, grace is measured out to each person according to the measure of Christ's gift.
[time=1740] I'm so grateful for the gifts that people like Tom Beckner have of being involved in digging deeper.
[time=1747] And I would encourage you to go on this week, Wednesday morning and check out more information about this talk this morning that Tom and Rick and I have been so just so blessed to work on and work with.
[time=1759] Verses four through six of Ephesians four talk about unity, but then verse seven says but, I mean I got a diverse seven this morning, that's okay.
[time=1768] No system of worldly thought could ever do that.
[time=1771] No worldly religious system could say unity and then have it look like diversity.
[time=1776] The guys that come back in my door, they all look the same.
[time=1780] I'll leave their names unspoken this morning.
[time=1782] They all look the same.
[time=1784] They all say the same things.
[time=1785] They're always asking the same questions.
[time=1787] Their pamphlets always have the same titles on them.
[time=1791] And if there's any variation from those questions, they're going to get called to account.
[time=1797] Unity in diversity.
[time=1799] That's what God calls us to.
[time=1801] Have you looked at this passage?
[time=1802] Look at, of course you have, verse four Ephesians four.
[time=1805] There is one body and one watch.
[time=1807] One spirit, verse six, one God and father of all who is overall and through all and in all, verse seven, but grace is given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ's gift who is called the son of God in verse 13 by Paul.
[time=1824] Spirit, father, son.
[time=1826] In the name of God, in his person, there's three persons, one God.
[time=1831] So God practices in himself, in his own person, unity in diversity.
[time=1837] God practices in him, it is awesome.
[time=1843] God practices in himself, unity in diversity.
[time=1845] He's in his very nature.
[time=1847] He is an example to us of what our community should be like because God's in community with himself.
[time=1853] Because the one God is in community with the other persons of himself.
[time=1857] It is, who could make that up?
[time=1860] Who could devise that sort of idea?
[time=1863] It is extraordinary.
[time=1864] It's a blessing to watch God show us how to behave in himself.
[time=1869] Spirit, father, son, one God in three persons.
[time=1873] A.W. Tozer said it this way, about community.
[time=1877] Has it ever occurred to you that 100 pianos all tuned to the same fork or automatically tuned to each other?
[time=1883] They are of one accord by being tuned, not to each other, but to another standard to which one must individually bow?
[time=1893] So 100 worshipers meeting together, each one looking away to Christ are in heart nearer to each other than it could possibly be if they were to become unity conscious and turn their eyes away from God to look for fellowship.
[time=1906] So we're all seeking Jesus.
[time=1908] We're closer together by doing that than if we would be if we said unity, unity, unity, unity.
[time=1913] Just by itself.
[time=1915] Social religion is perfected when private religion
[time=1921] is purified.
[time=1922] The body becomes stronger as its members become healthier.
[time=1929] Can I read that again?
[time=1930] The body becomes stronger as its members become healthier.
[time=1934] The whole church of God gains when the members that compose it begin to seek a better and a higher life in Christ.
[time=1942] A.W. Tozer says that when you and I seek Jesus, if I wanted to seek after you and develop a close relationship with you, the best way to do it is to pursue Christ.
[time=1953] It's a very simple example that someone gave to me one day in marriage.
[time=1958] For Jody and I to become closer together, it's like a pyramid.
[time=1961] And we are the two bottoms of the pyramid.
[time=1963] As we see Christ together, we're getting closer together ourselves.
[time=1967] Does that make sense?
[time=1968] So we're in the two bottoms of the pyramid.
[time=1969] As we see Christ up here, we're coming closer together.
[time=1972] That's how it is with us in the room.
[time=1975] Don't you feel a sense of community and oneness and blessing when you, we're all singing in the name of Jesus?
[time=1981] All singing praises to his name.
[time=1984] There's a sense in which there's nothing, there's a thrill of hope that I can't explain to somebody else.
[time=1987] I can't explain how I feel when I sing the hymn to God be the glory of the great things he has done.
[time=1994] And I'm not going to be on a cloud for all eternity, like bring singing all by myself.
[time=2001] We're all going to be together singing these songs for all eternity.
[time=2006] And we're never going to get older, tired.
[time=2009] Wish you guys could hear Kelly and Steve sing.
[time=2011] I said bye in this morning.
[time=2012] Great blessing to hear those guys sing.
[time=2015] I have a friend who lives in Australia on Facebook this past like he was talking about how he was at a conference.
[time=2019] And it was great to see a thousand, great to hear a thousand blokes singing praises to our God.
[time=2023] I'm like awesome.
[time=2024] A thousand blokes.
[time=2026] For all eternity, we are going to be in one accord with glorified bodies, perfect minds, singing these praises of God with perfect pitch.
[time=2036] For all eternity.
[time=2038] Wow.
[time=2042] The verse eight, never out of verse seven.
[time=2045] Verse eight, therefore it says when he ascended on high, he led a host of captives and gave gifts to men.
[time=2052] Verse nine, in saying he ascended, what does it mean but that he also descended into the lower regions, the earth.
[time=2059] Verse eight is a quote from Psalm 68.
[time=2062] And Paul takes the wording of the psalm and makes it a little bit different because he can.
[time=2066] Because the same Holy Spirit that inspired the psalmist is inspiring the apostle Paul.
[time=2072] And he's doing a new and glorious thing.
[time=2074] We can't do that.
[time=2076] But Paul can, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, he's taking this promise and making it a new promise.
[time=2081] The ascension is described, go to Luke's gospel.
[time=2083] Turn left if you would in your Bibles to Luke's gospel.
[time=2086] Is that weird to say, turn left.
[time=2089] Someone said it was weird to me.
[time=2090] I had to say all the time, I hope that's not weird.
[time=2093] Luke 24, the very, very end of his gospel describes what we refer to as the ascension.
[time=2099] John's gospel says that he ascended to his father.
[time=2104] So he wasn't just going somewhere, like blasting off.
[time=2106] He was going to a place.
[time=2107] He's going to a person.
[time=2108] And I want you to watch what happens here 'cause it matters, it really does.
[time=2115] Then he led them out as far as Bethany, this is Jesus.
[time=2118] Lifting up his hands, he blessed them.
[time=2120] While he blessed them, he parted from them.
[time=2121] It was carried up into heaven.
[time=2123] And they worshiped him.
[time=2125] In the book of Acts, on the disciples, get worshiped.
[time=2131] They say, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm just a guy.
[time=2133] Don't worship me.
[time=2134] There is no account in scripture of Jesus ever refusing worship.
[time=2139] It doesn't stop anybody.
[time=2143] That's a huge message all by itself.
[time=2146] They worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple, blessing God.
[time=2156] That's the ascension that Paul's referring to in Ephesians chapter four, if you want to go back there now.
[time=2161] In saying he ascended, what does it mean but that he also, he had to come down first.
[time=2165] So if there's a descent first, Christ becomes a man.
[time=2168] Whereas the crown of thorns dies a brutal, violent death
[time=2175] on our behalf, for us vile offenders, all.
[time=2180] He descends into the lower regions, the earth, it says there, in verse nine.
[time=2185] He who descended, verse 10, is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, far above all the heavens that he might fill all things.
[time=2196] Christ himself, this is the second observation.
[time=2202] I made Christ himself as the greatest gift.
[time=2204] He's the greatest gift.
[time=2207] Everywhere in this passage there is his name and he is himself the greatest gift, Christmastime is about the giving of gifts and how appropriate that Christ is born in us as the Christmas song says day by day by day.
[time=2223] Both the ascension of Christ and his descent reflect that he is the focus of this passage, our very lives.
[time=2230] We bear his name as Christians.
[time=2232] Ephesians one, 22 and 23 talks about this.
[time=2235] And he put all things under his feet, that is Jesus, and gave him as head over all things, all things to the church, which is his body.
[time=2246] The fullness of him who fills all in all.
[time=2250] Colossians chapter one, a soaring description of Jesus.
[time=2253] Listen to this, Colossians one, 16 through 18.
[time=2256] For by him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible.
[time=2264] This is referring to the person of Jesus.
[time=2267] Whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things were created through him and for him.
[time=2272] And he is before all things.
[time=2274] And in him all things hold together, so I'm familiar from this morning.
[time=2278] And he is the head of the body, the church.
[time=2281] He is the beginning, the first born from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent, that he might have first place.
[time=2289] Revelation describes him as the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.
[time=2294] He's the beginning and the end, everything in between.
[time=2296] He's everything.
[time=2298] He deserves my life.
[time=2300] If you are here this morning and you've never bowed the knee to Jesus, I am telling you.
[time=2304] He is the one who fills everything in every way.
[time=2309] And he is what you're looking for.
[time=2310] There are vain hopes out there, friends.
[time=2314] And there are lesser masters that we all have tried to surf.
[time=2317] And sin will take you farther than you want to go and it will keep you there longer than you want to stay.
[time=2323] And Jesus is who he says he is.
[time=2327] He merits our worship.
[time=2332] He descended into the lower regions, the earth that he might make provision for our salvation.
[time=2337] And that call goes out to each one of us today
[time=2343] to follow after him.
[time=2344] Romanian rule two in your outline describes the body of Christ, the body of Christ.
[time=2351] Calvin said this, John Calvin, we must always speak of the effectiveness, of the efficacy of the ministry in such a way that the entire praise of the work is reserved for God alone.
[time=2363] So whenever pastors figure it out, they get it right, God gets the glory.
[time=2370] To God be the glory, great things, he has done.
[time=2373] Not, I can fumble around in the Bible for a few minutes, but God gets the glory.
[time=2378] And any lucid thoughts you hear from me today, they're coming from him, not from me.
[time=2383] I hope you know that, it's true.
[time=2387] The first observation to make from verse 12 is to do the work of the ministry.
[time=2391] Do the work of the ministry.
[time=2393] Look at verse 11, he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds, and the teachers to equip the saints for the work of the ministry.
[time=2405] For building up the body of Christ.
[time=2407] Pastors, teachers, evangelists, do their work in such a way, they ought to do it in such a way that you are being built up to do the work of the ministry.
[time=2418] The old church model that says the pastor does everything, we pay him, you do it, you take care of it, I'll figure it out, that's not what the scripture teaches.
[time=2427] Friends, this is a model for church life, this passage.
[time=2432] For the building up of the saints, the holy ones, for the work of the ministry, that's what we're called to do.
[time=2439] Pastor teachers ought to behave in such a way they always keep that at the forefront.
[time=2445] That you are being built up so that you can do the work.
[time=2448] What's the work of the pastor teacher is to build you up, it's not going to have any work to do, but the work of the ministry is done by the people in the church who are the church themselves, obviously.
[time=2460] I hope you have the expectation of yourself.
[time=2463] Let's keep reading in this passage.
[time=2468] To equip the saints for the work of the ministry, for building up the body of Christ, verse 13, until, it's a beautiful word, until, it means it will happen, it will happen.
[time=2479] Not if we all attain, until we all attain.
[time=2483] A little word, it says a lot though.
[time=2485] If we all make it to the measure of the stature, it's not what it says, 'cause until we're gonna make it, because he who began a good work and you will be faithful to complete it until day of Christ Jesus, he began it, he saved you, he's gonna keep you saved, because he's just like that, he's good enough to do it, he fills everything in every way.
[time=2509] Until we all attain to the unity of the faith
[time=2515] and the knowledge of the Son of God to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature, of the fullness of Christ.
[time=2521] Second observation from Remenial 2 is, we have a future in Christ described here and the past without Christ.
[time=2528] In verse 14 is the past, verse 14 is what we have right now, attain to the unity of the faith.
[time=2534] We're striving toward a person, friends.
[time=2539] Not a system, not a list, but a person.
[time=2543] The knowledge of the, Paul only calls Jesus the Son of God four times in the Holy Testament, and here's one of them.
[time=2549] He's a person, until we all attain to the unity of the faith to the knowledge of the Son of God.
[time=2555] Not knowledge of the Son of God's teachings, not vague ideas about what the way I have to live my life but to a person.
[time=2564] So to the cliche that Christianity isn't religious or relationship, that happens to be true.
[time=2570] Relationship to God, through his son, Jesus.
[time=2575] To mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, I observe with you that the end goal for us and the church isn't just to get people saved.
[time=2589] The goal, follow me.
[time=2590] The goal, according to what Paul says, is to grow each person up to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[time=2596] That's what we're about, not about just, well, pray the prayer and we're done.
[time=2602] That's a very bizarre idea that somehow crept in along the way, somewhere in the course of my life, and it's just not a biblical idea.
[time=2611] We are responsible with every person in our influence to grow them up to mature manhood, to a full grown man.
[time=2618] Kelly asked what kind of people to go help with the tables in the gym?
[time=2625] Remember what he said?
[time=2626] What kind of people?
[time=2627] Young, strapping men.
[time=2629] Kelly's not gonna go to my son's class.
[time=2630] You can say, "Hey, three-year-olds.
[time=2631] "Let's go move some tables." So that would be weird, wouldn't it?
[time=2636] To have a bunch of three-year-olds expected to move tables.
[time=2641] And if we have churches filled up with spiritual three-year-olds, we're gonna be in trouble.
[time=2647] That's why Paul says, "Until we all attain "the unity of faith and to the knowledge of the Son of God "to mature manhood to a full grown, young, strapping person, "spiritually alive, mature, awake,
[time=2664] "to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." Now, here's, I observed this too, in that verse.
[time=2671] The measure of the stature, can any of us say that we've arrived?
[time=2675] Oh, I've got that, sure.
[time=2676] The measure, the measure, same word as in verse seven, the quantity, the stature of Christ, I'm there.
[time=2685] Yeah.
[time=2686] So what's this church about, Bible, reading, but I'm already there, I'm already there.
[time=2690] I'm already got the fullness of Christ.
[time=2692] Nobody can say that.
[time=2694] If you do say that, you're a liar, and God's truth doesn't abide in you from first John.
[time=2699] So I'll smack you across the face from the pulpit here, in that respect.
[time=2703] The measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, no one, we cannot say that we've arrived.
[time=2708] I know people who have been in ministry, and so do many of you, for 50 years.
[time=2713] And you say, to them, what have you learned in your 50 years of ministry?
[time=2717] And if they're wise, and they are at that point, they'll say, I'm just scratching the surface.
[time=2722] It keeps us humble, friends, the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[time=2730] Roman numerals, well, Roman numerals too, ends there with the past without, in verse 14, that we no longer be children.
[time=2738] Tossed to and fro by the waves, and carried about, by every wind of doctrine.
[time=2742] There's a picture of a weather vane here, just blowing every which way.
[time=2745] You know, wins that way, wins that way, wins that way.
[time=2748] My son went to the basketball games yesterday, with a bunch of suckers in his hand, to give to all of his friends.
[time=2754] And he had him, he had him in his hand, at the point that went to the bathroom.
[time=2758] He almost had an accident, because he couldn't figure out, holding a sucker, and getting his pants, that he couldn't figure out how to do that.
[time=2763] And actually, this week, he had like a ball in his hand, he was trying to, I love my son desperately.
[time=2768] So I'm not ragging at my son, I love him.
[time=2771] He's three though.
[time=2773] So he has a ball in his hand, I can't figure out how to get the ball in his hand, and go to the bathroom at the same time.
[time=2777] So he had an accident in the bathroom, because he had the ball in his hand, and he couldn't figure out how to do that at the same time.
[time=2783] No longer be children.
[time=2784] No, he's three and it's okay.
[time=2785] If that was one of my students, we'd have some struggles in the high school.
[time=2792] You know, put the ball down, man, it's really okay.
[time=2795] We may no longer be children.
[time=2799] The word for children are as a person who approaches spiritual things like a child.
[time=2804] Tossed you and fro, I got my suckers in my hand.
[time=2809] And that's what, and so going to the bathroom is as an afterthought, you know.
[time=2814] But the weather of an idea is that there's winds and doctrine blowing every which way, I'll just do whatever they say.
[time=2820] By human cunning, by craftiness and deceitful schemes, the word for deceitful schemes are as of a person who has played dice.
[time=2827] And they were notorious for being dishonest, for making it go a certain way.
[time=2832] That's what we used to be like, no longer.
[time=2838] Verse 14 says, no longer.
[time=2842] And I say before you, no longer.
[time=2845] Let's grow up into the measure of the stature, of the fullness of Christ together.
[time=2850] And you can't simply do that, friends, sitting in those pews in this room for 45 minutes, or for an hour and 15 minutes.
[time=2857] Did you hear the testimonies this morning and the videos?
[time=2860] I didn't cook those up.
[time=2862] Those were their own personal witness.
[time=2866] You need to be in community with smaller communities of people growing up to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[time=2874] This is not enough.
[time=2876] This is a part of it.
[time=2877] This time right now is a part of that, but it's not gonna be enough.
[time=2881] You need to be in a smaller community somewhere.
[time=2883] And this church has all kinds of wonderful opportunities for that.
[time=2886] See the kiosk in the foyer about those things.
[time=2890] We need you.
[time=2891] I'm a teacher by trade.
[time=2894] And I know that one of the fundamental aspects of being a good teacher is getting people involved in the discussion.
[time=2901] And if one person comes to class unprepared, it affects everybody else.
[time=2906] 'Cause they are benefiting from that person's study.
[time=2909] The same thing is true in this room.
[time=2912] If I behave like a spiritual three-year-old all week long, it's gonna affect other people.
[time=2916] Are you following?
[time=2918] So we've got to be diligent.
[time=2922] Remember Tozer's comments?
[time=2923] Diligent privately, so we can be diligent publicly.
[time=2928] We need each other in smaller, connecting settings.
[time=2932] We need it.
[time=2933] And there are many, many, many opportunities.
[time=2936] If you're interested, please come ask.
[time=2938] Just ask, take a step of faith.
[time=2940] We need you.
[time=2941] This church, these people who are the church, we need you in all the gifts that Christ measured out to you.
[time=2948] Christ measured gifts.
[time=2950] If you are called by His name, you have been given a gift by Him.
[time=2953] He measured it out to you.
[time=2956] He apportioned it, this quantity, this amount to you.
[time=2960] And we need that gift.
[time=2961] Hide under a bushel?
[time=2965] No.
[time=2966] I'm gonna let it shine.
[time=2967] In conclusion, friends, this quickly, room in room of three is the headship of Christ.
[time=2973] On our t-shirts all over Triton yesterday, here's the first observation.
[time=2977] Do work.
[time=2981] Speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into Him who is the head into Christ, from whom the whole body joined and held together by every joint with which it's equipped, when each part's working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.
[time=3002] Do work.
[time=3005] The work of the ministry is yours to do.
[time=3008] And I pray that you've been doing it.
[time=3010] This is a call, maybe, to do it in a more realized way.
[time=3013] Second observation I would make, friends, is in verse 16, build yourself up.
[time=3017] We equip you to do the work of the ministry that you will be involved privately on your own in building yourself up.
[time=3025] And all that comes from Christ.
[time=3027] Do you see that in verse 16?
[time=3030] From whom the whole body, it's a person.
[time=3034] From whom the whole body, Christ's body, Corbin is gonna give us a chance here at the end of our time together, just to reflect on what we've said, and I'll ask him to come up at this time.
[time=3049] We've said a lot about Christ's gift, Christ's body, Christ's headship.
[time=3054] All of those things are given to us that we might adequately rightly respond.
[time=3059] I would just ask you, as Corbin placed, take a minute and to reflect.
[time=3062] Have I given all that I need to give to this place?
[time=3068] We're gonna give you chances to serve by the grace of God.
[time=3071] We're gonna keep doing that, but we need you.
[time=3074] We need you in this place to serve these people
[time=3080] who are the church, with the gift that God has given you.
[time=3083] We may no longer be children, tossed to and fro
[time=3092] by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness and deceitful schemes, rather speaking the truth and love.
[time=3101] Love without truth is flabby.
[time=3105] Truth without love is cold, and that's the response to the deceitful schemes, to cunning, to craftiness is truthful speaking.
[time=3119] Literally in the Greek guys there, it's truthing in love.
[time=3122] Speaking the truth is one word in the Greek, it's truthing in love.
[time=3126] God, I pray that right now as my brothers and sisters in this room, consider what your word has said, that you would let it do its work.
[time=3135] And as they meditate on your word and seek your face in all things, I pray that you would have your way and that you would do what you said you would do with each one to whom you've given these gifts.
[time=3150] It's my prayer father in Jesus' name.
[time=3156] We're gonna sing one song together before we leave today.
[time=3160] Our hymn that's a great prayer for the church, that God would lead us on and that he would lead us forward, and I think in response to all that Steve's brought to our attention today, it would be appropriate for us to stand and pray these lyrics together, so let's do that.
[time=3177] (gentle music)
[time=3185] [MUSIC - 44 seconds]
[time=3233] (gentle music)
[time=3240] [MUSIC - 205 seconds]
[time=3463] (upbeat music) - Lead on, O King Eternal.
[time=3467] We follow not with fears.
[time=3468] For gladness breaks like mourning wherever your face appears.
[time=3472] Your cross has lifted over us.
[time=3474] We journey in its light.
[time=3475] The crown awaits the conquest.
[time=3478] Lead on, O King, O God of might.
[time=3481] And all God's people said, amen.
[time=3483] (upbeat music)
