[time=30] [MUSIC - 137 seconds]
[time=172] - Well, hello there, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=182] It's great to have you with us.
[time=183] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=188] And as always, we're really thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=191] As you can see, I've got my T-shirt on and what you can't see down below here is I've got my bathing suit on as well, which means around here one thing.
[time=199] And that is we're about to experience baptisms this morning here in our worship service.
[time=206] It's an amazing experience.
[time=207] I can't wait to get in those waters and I can't wait for those who are being baptized today to share with our family and with you their stories of life change and transformation.
[time=218] It's the life change and transformation of a life that comes when someone fully surrenders their heart and life to Jesus Christ.
[time=227] And I wanna just take just a couple of minutes this morning.
[time=230] I don't do this very often.
[time=232] Maybe I don't do it as often as I should, but I know that there are literally thousands of you who watch each and every week.
[time=239] You watch on Sunday mornings, you pick up this broadcast on our website during the week.
[time=244] And I wanna just say to you, if you've been watching and if the spirit of God has been moving in your life, if there is something going on in you spiritually and you sense God bringing you to a place of clarification and conviction, a place of commitment, I just wanna encourage you to make that commitment, to bow the knee of your heart and fully surrender your heart and life to Jesus Christ.
[time=271] What a joy it would be for us to get to meet you.
[time=274] What a thrill it would be for us to get to do what we're gonna do this morning with others who have come.
[time=279] What a thrill it would be to baptize you.
[time=282] You're part of our family.
[time=283] I've said that before, our broadcast audience really is part of the Black Hawk family.
[time=288] And even though maybe for a while you haven't been in the room, so to speak, we'd love to have you here.
[time=293] So as you watch these baptisms, as you hear me talk even this morning about people coming to this place of commitment, we'd love to hear from you.
[time=301] I'd love to answer any of your questions.
[time=303] I'd love to meet with you.
[time=304] I'd love to talk with you on the phone.
[time=306] If there's something we can do to help move you forward toward faith in Christ, please let us know.
[time=312] Our websites here on the bottom of the screen, you can call the church office.
[time=316] There's our church number on the bottom down here as well.
[time=319] We care about you and we're thankful for what God is doing in your heart and life.
[time=324] Hey, God bless you.
[time=325] And I mean that.
[time=326] I hope today is an encouragement to you as you watch.
[time=330] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=333] Have a great week.
[time=335] - Well, good morning.
[time=336] You sound great.
[time=337] It's good to be together and good to be able to worship our God.
[time=341] And we get to worship him in these next few minutes as we celebrate his transforming life-changing work and some anemominous son who are gonna come into the waters here in just a minute and share with you what he's done in their lives.
[time=357] I want you to be encouraged.
[time=359] I want you to be excited by this.
[time=361] This is good news to see God changing and transforming lives.
[time=367] So be encouraged.
[time=368] Leslie and Bryce, come on in, if you will.
[time=370] I think they brought some friends as well.
[time=373] You may recognize Leslie a few weeks ago, she came and shared her story right down there on the stage and she's back today to be baptized.
[time=381] And her son Bryce is with her.
[time=383] Hey, go.
[time=384] And I'm gonna have Bryce go first and just share with you the story that God's put on his heart.
[time=390] And then Leslie will go after him.
[time=392] Okay.
[time=393] Hello, my name is Bryce with me.
[time=395] I am raised by a single parent, my mother.
[time=398] I have a 10 year old brother with type one diabetes.
[time=402] I have never met my father and I really don't plan on meeting him any time soon.
[time=407] I play football and hopefully baseball for Snyder High School.
[time=411] I enjoy all sports hanging out with my friends and well, just having fun.
[time=416] I became a current Christian because I am tired of being confused about life.
[time=422] And to find the real reason why I'm on earth, which is to follow Christ.
[time=427] Also, my mom is a new Christian and I have seen how it has changed her life from sadness to being happy.
[time=435] My past was full of lying, cheating, and doing things that aren't, well, not very good.
[time=440] I gave my life to Christ after having a talk about how Christ changed her life.
[time=449] Lately, I have noticed that I have become closer to God in making better decisions.
[time=454] I want to give more time to others.
[time=458] Wait, hold on.
[time=461] Okay, then just myself.
[time=464] Sorry about that.
[time=465] I want to be baptized 'cause I want to be 'cause I know I want to show my new love and commitment to our Lord and Savior.
[time=478] Jesus Christ.
[time=479] (audience applauds) - Actually, let's do this.
[time=490] Let's have you read now and then we'll baptize you both when you're done.
[time=494] - Great.
[time=495] Good morning, brothers and sisters in Christ.
[time=498] - Morning, listen.
[time=499] - Morning.
[time=500] I may not know you, but I already love you.
[time=502] This is a statement I have applied to my life since becoming involved at Black Hawk Celebrate Recovery.
[time=507] You see, through the years of searching for love and all the wrong places, love found me.
[time=512] In mid-October of 2009, while recovering from surgery and coming to terms with another failed relationship, I became depressed.
[time=519] My mind kept reminding me of my past and my body was struggling to heal.
[time=524] I had become physically and emotionally and mentally exhausted.
[time=527] As I lay on the couch, a voice came to me and said, "Get up and get your Bible out of the attic." I questioned the thought and ignored it.
[time=534] If I grabbed a Bible, it would most likely turn to a raging inferno.
[time=539] After three days of this nagging voice telling me, "Get up and get your Bible out of the attic." I finally listened.
[time=546] I grabbed the ladder and climbed up into the attic to search through boxes to find this Bible.
[time=550] Finally, I found it and brought it inside.
[time=552] I carried to the basement and placed it beside me.
[time=555] As I stared at this book, I thought to myself, "Okay, here it is.
[time=558] Now what?" I started in the back under subject index and looked for scriptures about depression, then scriptures on abandonment.
[time=567] Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.
[time=570] I couldn't get enough of it.
[time=572] I had to tell someone about this amazing feeling, so I called Tammy, a loyal Christian friend of mine, as I explained the story she tells me, "God has knocked on your door and you have let him in.
[time=585] Why don't you try a 1045 service on Sunday at Blackhawk?
[time=588] You will love Pastor Kelly Sermon." So that following Sunday, I attended.
[time=593] When I walked through the door, I took a look around and recognized the familiar face, Shelly.
[time=599] She was standing beside the Celebrate Recovery Table.
[time=601] I walked up to her and she had this look of amazement.
[time=604] I didn't know you attended Blackhawk.
[time=606] She said, "I replied, 'I don't.
[time=609] Today's my first day coming here.'" As we stood there catching up on the path to the present, she tells me about Celebrate Recovery.
[time=617] "Please come." This is Friday, seven to nine.
[time=620] "You're going to love it." Shelly was right, I loved it.
[time=623] I walked into a room of people of different racial backgrounds, different age groups, and they welcomed me with loving arms and tender words.
[time=631] The love and fellowship that fills that room is profound.
[time=634] The bond between all of them shows how God is working among the Celebrate Recovery group.
[time=639] I must confess my initial thought was recovery.
[time=641] I'm not an alcoholic or a drug addict.
[time=643] How can this group be for me?
[time=645] What if I run into someone I recognize and they get the wrong impression?
[time=650] I know I need recovery for more emotional past hurts could this group really work for me?
[time=655] As much as my thoughts tried to discourage me, God had bigger and better plans.
[time=660] My first Friday at CRI quickly figured out these are wondering souls that are being handed a well-structured Christ-driven plan.
[time=667] How fantastic is this?
[time=670] During times of weakness and brokenness and are just spiritually doubtful, here's a group that will love you for you.
[time=676] God has all his troubled children in mind when he gave birth to Celebrate Recovery.
[time=681] I thank God for leading me to C.R.
[time=683] and my recovery is moving along very well through Celebrate Recovery.
[time=687] The Lord has introduced me to so many God-fearing people, Psalm 1.
[time=694] Blessed is the man who does not walk in the council of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers, but his delight is in the law of the Lord.
[time=704] And on his law, he meditates day and night.
[time=707] He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields his fruit and season, and his leaf does not weather.
[time=714] Whether he does prosper, not so the wicked.
[time=718] They are like shaft that wind blows away.
[time=721] Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
[time=726] For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way the wicked will perish.
[time=731] The relationship I have devolved have been contributed to my recovery.
[time=737] God has blessed me with a new Christian family.
[time=740] In this family we support one another, lean upon one another, and love one another without judgment.
[time=746] I've been attending CR Sunday services, reading scripture and praying all the time.
[time=751] Once again, instead of a voice, I started to have the strong desire to do service work.
[time=755] I wanted to do the Lord's work and please him.
[time=758] This feeling became very strong on a weekend, and by Monday morning I had an email from Shelley about a woman in need.
[time=764] This was my opportunity to work for the Lord.
[time=768] The Lord called and I answered.
[time=770] I am truly blessed that God searched me out, nagged me enough to give in to him, and ask him for forgiveness of my sins, and he welcomed me into his family.
[time=780] Ephesians one, three through six.
[time=783] Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
[time=793] For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight.
[time=799] In love, he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the one he loves.
[time=815] I now know that I control nothing.
[time=818] It's all in God's hands and by God's plans.
[time=821] I surrender it all to God.
[time=823] My worries, fears, finances, career, children in my home, and the Lord provides.
[time=828] So when he calls upon me, either to worship, service or witness, I'm going to do, as my Father tells me to.
[time=836] So if you are a baby Christian, or a lifelong loyal Christian, and you feel distant from God, please consider, celebrate recovery, and it was with everything.
[time=847] Surrender it all to him.
[time=851] Find time to service for the Lord, and feel the love that will embrace you, and never release you.
[time=856] Hebrews 13.5, God has said, I will never fail you.
[time=862] I will never forsake you.
[time=864] (audience applauding) - All right, you should keep back that way a little bit.
[time=875] All right, here we go.
[time=877] We got so many people, and here we got waves.
[time=880] This is good.
[time=882] Bryce, it's an honor for all of us in this family.
[time=887] To hear your story and to know of your commitment to Christ, we know that you love him, we know that you have fully surrendered.
[time=895] Your heart and life to him, we know how grateful you are for the work he's done in your mom's life, and what a joy for all of us to get to share in this with you today.
[time=904] It's my privilege to baptize you, Bryce, as your pastor and friend, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=912] (audience applauding) Good job, buddies.
[time=916] Good job, guys.
[time=917] (audience applauding) - That was nice.
[time=927] - All right, Leslie.
[time=929] Thank you for sharing not only your story, but your life with us.
[time=934] Friends, thank you for the investment you guys have made in her life.
[time=940] And thank you, Black Hawk, for the way that you continue to be used by God as he grows a diverse community of disciples.
[time=949] And thank you, Leslie.
[time=951] We know that you love the Lord.
[time=953] We know and can see him and you as he changes you and transforms you.
[time=959] And as your friend and pastor, it's an honor to baptize you today in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=965] (audience applauding) Good job.
[time=969] (audience applauding) (upbeat music)
[time=990] [MUSIC - 174 seconds]
[time=1169] - I've seen so much growth since my time here at Black Hawk.
[time=1194] And both in the gathering on a Sunday morning, but also in my small group.
[time=1199] And when I think about how God is growing me and discipling me, the way that comes to mind is worship.
[time=1207] And I want to preface that by saying this, that when I say worship, I think it's so much more than a style of music or about preaching style or service.
[time=1218] I don't think it worships about that, but rather worships about a lifestyle that we're called to by God, the Father.
[time=1226] I'm Adam Hull, and I'm grateful to see what God is doing with the family at Black Hawk.
[time=1231] (gentle music) - The transparencies taught me how to work with people.
[time=1241] For so long, I've quote unquote been the student in the skull through celebrate, recovery, although it's a program and I don't like programs that never have, I love truth.
[time=1253] But this particular program, I can see how it's genuinely getting to a place where people are opening up.
[time=1264] Those who may not be believers are exposed to the gospel and the word of God.
[time=1268] And so personally, for me, it's taught me how to connect with people and how God wants me to be patient, to listen and to hear people and definitely see where they're hurting.
[time=1282] And of course, I'm hurting myself.
[time=1283] So I came to celebrate recovery, to serve and minister, but over these last almost two years, God's been teaching me that I'm the one with the baggage and I'm the one that needs to confess before the Lord.
[time=1299] And in the process, of course, you get to know people.
[time=1301] You get to, that's the nitty-gritty and the practice of the theology.
[time=1306] Loving people and being there with them.
[time=1309] I'm Jesus Escobedo and I'm grateful that God is using Blackhawk to grow me as a disciple.
[time=1316] For one thing, I am just so grateful for you
[time=1325] being here for us every Sunday.
[time=1328] And we've watched you grow.
[time=1330] And I can add here that I have been at this church since 1980,
[time=1338] I guess, when I came here.
[time=1340] Pastor Jeremiah was here again and he baptized me.
[time=1344] And this was through my sister Roselyn Corn and my husband and I had gone to a different church at one time and I thought I was saved.
[time=1355] But coming here changed a lot of things for me and changed me greatly.
[time=1360] And I love the Lord.
[time=1362] I just praise the Lord and I can get out of that bed each morning.
[time=1365] And I'm so grateful for this family here, besides my family at home.
[time=1370] This is my second home.
[time=1372] And I have made a lot of friends and just recently having lost my husband.
[time=1379] There were a few other women that lost their husbands about the same time.
[time=1383] And you realize how much, how people can actually get through these things without knowing Jesus.
[time=1390] I would never know because that gave me a lot of strength.
[time=1395] I'm Sally Monting and I'm so glad that God is using me through black hole to be a disciple here.
[time=1401] A friend sent me a link to a ministry downtown SOS
[time=1415] Saints on the Street, which that involves going out.
[time=1419] Every Monday night we pack a backpack with hygiene items, food, blankets, hats, gloves, whatever you think someone homeless would need.
[time=1430] And we just walk the streets, find people under door stoops, find people in stairwells and parking garages.
[time=1440] And then also another big part of it is a tie in with the Salvation Army and having a great relationship there, helping those guys through that whole rehab process.
[time=1451] So it's been very rewarding, humbling.
[time=1455] There's a lot of words to explain it.
[time=1458] I'm Jim Bell.
[time=1459] I'm grateful that God is using Black Hawk to grow me as a disciple.
[time=1462] I'm encouraged by the generosity that I see.
[time=1478] I remember last year in February, you had made the announcement about the 410 Ministries, which is going into the exotic dancing clubs.
[time=1488] And you had asked people if they would be willing to donate.
[time=1491] I think we were asking for like $7.
[time=1494] And we were hoping to get enough to cover that.
[time=1499] And the church just overwhelmed us.
[time=1502] We ended up getting over $4,000.
[time=1504] We still have that money.
[time=1506] And we're still continuing to go in and give gifts.
[time=1509] But we still have that money.
[time=1511] That was really encouraging.
[time=1515] I'm Tammy Crane.
[time=1516] And I'm grateful that God is using Black to grow me as a disciple.
[time=1520] I hope that's as encouraging to you as it is to me.
[time=1529] You've heard me say it for a long time.
[time=1531] It's really, really true.
[time=1533] Red, yellow, black, brown, white, doesn't matter.
[time=1537] Young, old, been here 30 years, been here three weeks.
[time=1542] Educated, uneducated.
[time=1545] God is using and growing a diverse community of disciples.
[time=1549] Here at Black Hawk to make a difference in this world that he's placed us in.
[time=1553] And I'm so thankful that we get to hear the stories like we heard today and the water and those stories there on the screen.
[time=1558] What a privilege for you and I to get to be a part of it.
[time=1561] And I hope you're just as encouraged as can be as you and I get to see God at work in our midst.
[time=1568] Hey, it's good to be together this morning.
[time=1569] It's been a few weeks and great to be back with you.
[time=1572] Thankful for my buddy, Scott Arnavana, who was here a few weeks ago.
[time=1576] Thankful that Mitch Cruz could be with us and really grateful for Steve Webster last week as he got us back into our study of the book of Ephesians.
[time=1583] We're going to come back to this in just a moment here.
[time=1586] Couple things, first of all, faith basics.
[time=1588] You heard him talk about it this morning on Blackhawk on the run, or I hope you did.
[time=1592] Anybody in the room this morning, anybody watching online or through the broadcast, if we can help you at the beginning of your spiritual journey, we'd love nothing more.
[time=1604] Faith basics gives you a chance to come and ask questions about the Bible, ask questions about Jesus, ask questions about God and spiritual living.
[time=1613] And faith basics is a six week class with some people who would love to help you think those things through.
[time=1618] So go out to the foyer or go online.
[time=1621] There'll be some folks out at the table today, they'd love to answer any questions and get you signed up.
[time=1626] All right, open your Bibles, if you would, to Ephesians chapter four.
[time=1630] Last time we were together, last time I was with you, we had the privilege of kind of turning the corner, if you will, in this study that we've entitled, you see it there on the screen, the truth, the way, the life, the truth about our salvation, Ephesians one, two, and three.
[time=1646] The fact that we've been chosen, the fact that we've been adopted, the fact that we've been redeemed and saved, the fact we learned in those first three chapters that we have been made new, he turns the corner in chapter four and begins to say in light of all that God's done and in light of your salvation and redemption now, it's so very important that you live like it.
[time=1670] And we came to four, one.
[time=1671] Look in your Bibles there at Ephesians four, verse one.
[time=1675] And at this pivot point in the book, Paul says, therefore, I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you, I beg you, I urge you to walk in a manner axios worthy.
[time=1689] We talked about that word a few weeks ago.
[time=1692] I beg you to walk worthy, to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called.
[time=1700] You've been chosen, saved, redeemed, given love, hope, and the Holy Spirit, chapters one through three.
[time=1705] Now chapter four, verse one, live like it.
[time=1707] What's on the one side, positionally in Christ, all that he has given you.
[time=1713] Now practically the word axios meant to balance that out.
[time=1717] Have what is on the one side, your practice, match up with what is on the other side, your position.
[time=1725] And we saw the first expression of worthy living that God chose to address in the lives of those at Ephesus and in our lives here at Black Hawk is the way that we in the church treat each other.
[time=1739] The very first thing he deals with is this issue of unity there in chapter four, verses one to six, unity, harmony, you before me kind of thinking.
[time=1752] And chapter four, verses seven to 16, Paul side bars briefly on the topic of spiritual gifts and how the use of those gifts, you'll remember this from Steve's message last week, how the use of those gifts grows and strengthens the body.
[time=1768] And now in four, 17, which is where we'll be today, he comes back to worthy walk stuff.
[time=1778] He comes back to worthy walk principles.
[time=1781] He comes back to appropriate lifestyle and behavior.
[time=1784] Look with me at verses 17 to 24, Ephesians four, verses 17 to 24, and in honor of God's word, would you stand and allow me to read this to you this morning?
[time=1796] So this I say, Ephesians four, 17, so this I say and affirm together with the Lord.
[time=1804] Paul realizes that what he's about to say is so important, he wants his readers to understand that this isn't just him, this what he's about to say, he affirms with the Lord as well, that you believer, you redeemed, you saved individuals, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk in the futility of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them because of the hardness of their heart.
[time=1839] And they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.
[time=1851] But you, believer, child of God, adopted, you did not learn Christ in this way.
[time=1860] If indeed, you have heard him and have been taught in him just as truth is in Jesus, that in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside all of that.
[time=1873] You lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit and that you having laid aside that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.
[time=1886] And you saved and redeemed, put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.
[time=1899] Father in heaven, we stand humbly before you this morning and pray again, God, that you would in ways that only you can through the spirit and word of God, that you would remind us, that you would convict us, that you would challenge us and change us and transform us.
[time=1915] God, allow your truth to move us in directions that would be honoring to you.
[time=1921] God, allow your truth to move us in directions that would allow us the privilege of making much of you.
[time=1927] And all the people in the room agreed and said, Amen, you can be seated.
[time=1933] Paul comes back to, as we come to Ephesians 4, 17 to 24,
[time=1939] Paul comes back to a central truth here in Ephesians and really a central truth throughout the entire New Testament.
[time=1947] And that central truth is this, don't miss it, how you live matters.
[time=1953] He comes back and starts talking about our walk.
[time=1958] He comes back and starts talking again about the day to day of life, how you live matters.
[time=1963] My friends, how you live is telling.
[time=1966] And what do I mean by telling?
[time=1968] What I mean is this, how you live reveals what you what?
[time=1972] Believe.
[time=1973] And that's just, that's just the truth.
[time=1978] How you and I live, the patterns of our lives,
[time=1984] the choices that we make, the things that we value, the principles that we follow, how we live clearly puts on display what we believe.
[time=1993] And what we believe either condemns us or saves us.
[time=2000] And this is, I wanna say this before we jump in, this is a really interesting passage because this passage is written to believers.
[time=2011] This whole book is written to the church at Ephesus.
[time=2014] And while this passage talks about the kind of living that we were to have laid aside, while this passage talks about really the patterns of those who don't believe, it speaks to believers in that it calls us to look back at a life we've left, but it also speaks to those who haven't bowed the knee of your heart yet.
[time=2038] And it says to you in a very confrontive, but I think loving way, hey, stop, look, look at you.
[time=2049] Look at how you live, look at how you think.
[time=2052] While it's a passage clearly intended to encourage and move believers forward, it gives those of you in the room and those of you watching right now live online and those of you who will listen to this in the weeks to come, it gives you an opportunity to look honestly.
[time=2068] And sincerely at the reality of life lived apart from him.
[time=2076] And it's graphic and it's pointed and it's honest and we need to take a look.
[time=2083] We need to take a look.
[time=2087] He says, don't live any more like godless people.
[time=2091] Don't live like you're separated from the truth.
[time=2095] Godless people in the text there, you see it in verse 18 and verse 17.
[time=2099] He says, don't live just as the Gentiles.
[time=2102] He's not talking about the ethnic Gentiles there.
[time=2106] He's talking about godless people.
[time=2108] He's talking about people separated from God.
[time=2111] He's talking about those who haven't fully surrendered.
[time=2114] He's talking about those who are completely governed by not the spirit of God, but their sinful nature, Gentiles.
[time=2120] He says, don't live like that.
[time=2122] Don't live like those who aren't redeemed.
[time=2126] Don't live like those who don't possess the spirit of God.
[time=2129] He describes unbelieving living in four ways.
[time=2132] Here we go.
[time=2133] I hope you'll write these things down.
[time=2134] Those who haven't fully surrendered, their heart and life to Christ are number one, verse 17, intellectually empty.
[time=2147] This is a reminder for those who are saved, for those still holding back, this might be an honest wake-up call.
[time=2155] A plea from us and from the spirit of God to you to surrender.
[time=2161] He describes unbelieving living in four ways.
[time=2166] Number one, minus a full surrender of one's heart to Christ.
[time=2171] We live intellectually empty.
[time=2173] Look at what it says there in 17.
[time=2175] So this I say in a firm together with the Lord that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, there it is, in the futility of their mind.
[time=2185] In the futility of their mind, if you live today outside of a relationship with Jesus Christ, the scriptures teach that you're living mentally, you're living in futility.
[time=2196] Go back in your Bibles.
[time=2198] Let me hear those pages turned.
[time=2200] First Corinthians chapter two.
[time=2202] Go to first Corinthians chapter two, would you?
[time=2205] Let me try to just explain this to you through what Paul said to the church at Corinth in the second chapter, verse 14.
[time=2213] First Corinthians chapter two, 14, intellectually empty.
[time=2217] What does that mean?
[time=2218] What does that look like?
[time=2219] Well, here you go, try this on.
[time=2220] But a natural man, Paul says, but a natural man.
[time=2224] A man who lives outside of the spirit of God.
[time=2228] A man left to himself, you with me?
[time=2231] But a natural man does not accept the things of the spirit of God for they are what?
[time=2238] Say it, foolishness to him.
[time=2240] Maybe you've seen this.
[time=2242] Maybe this was you.
[time=2244] Maybe you've watched somebody far from God come in contact with the truth about God.
[time=2250] And you've seen that puzzle look on their face.
[time=2252] You've seen them as you've talked with them about the convictions that God's given you and you're wanting to obey him and honor him by giving yourself to this or to that.
[time=2261] And they look at you like you're from Mars.
[time=2264] They don't understand why you'd stay married.
[time=2270] They don't understand why you'd parent that way.
[time=2273] They don't understand why you'd run your business with these kinds of principles.
[time=2279] But a natural man does not accept the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness to him and he cannot understand them because they, these things are spiritually appraised, spiritually grounded.
[time=2297] As far as, think about this, as far as spiritual or moral issues are concerned, for the unbeliever they're thinking, their rational processes are distorted and inadequate.
[time=2313] Someone whose mind hasn't been redeemed.
[time=2320] You understand that, right?
[time=2322] We often think of hearts getting redeemed.
[time=2325] We often think of our bodies kind of being redeemed and renewed.
[time=2329] You understand this, right?
[time=2330] When you come to faith in Christ, your brain gets redeemed.
[time=2335] Your mind gets renewed.
[time=2338] And someone whose mind, whose brain hasn't been redeemed, that mind has no capacity to produce godly understanding or moral living.
[time=2349] And please hear me on this.
[time=2350] It doesn't matter how bright you are.
[time=2357] It doesn't matter how sharp, how intellectually talented you may be and there may be people in the room, there may be some of you watching live online today, there may be folks listening to my voice and you may be really, really smart.
[time=2371] But your bright, sharp mind will only lead you
[time=2378] to empty, futile, foolish speculation unless it gets saved, unless the mind gets renewed.
[time=2387] Romans one, we'll go back and forth today
[time=2394] from Ephesians four to Romans one.
[time=2395] Go to Romans one, 21, if you will.
[time=2397] Paul writes to the church at Rome, he says in Romans one, which is an entire chapter describing the condition of the immoral man far from God.
[time=2408] Says in Romans one, 21, for even though they knew God, cognitively even though they knew about God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks, but they became, here it is, but they became futile in their speculations and their foolish heart was darkened, professing to be wise, they became, what, say it, fools.
[time=2431] If you haven't surrendered your heart and life to Christ,
[time=2438] if you haven't been renewed and redeemed, you will experience intellectual emptiness.
[time=2445] It'll never make sense.
[time=2448] It'll always end up in futility.
[time=2450] Number two, those who haven't fully surrendered their hearts and lives to Christ are spiritually separated from God.
[time=2458] What a tragic thought.
[time=2461] Go back to Ephesians four, spiritually separated from God.
[time=2466] It says there in verse 18, it says, being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them because of the hardness of their heart.
[time=2481] Their minds are futile.
[time=2483] Verse 17 establishes this for us.
[time=2486] Their minds are not redeemed and their intellectual emptiness leads eventually, the text says, to not only in ignorance, but a hardening of the heart.
[time=2496] We'll talk about that in just a moment.
[time=2499] And verse 18 says it clearly, right there, we just read it, the ignorance and hardness of heart leads to further distance spiritually between that individual and God.
[time=2512] It doesn't get closer, it never gets closer, it always continues to distance itself.
[time=2519] I wanna tell you something this morning, I wanna say it to you, I wanna say it to you in love, I wanna speak the truth in love to you today, but I've gotta say this and many of you need to hear this, so please know the heart with which I say it, those who have not bowed the knee of their heart to God if you have not fully surrendered your heart in life to him, he is not with you.
[time=2545] He's not with you, you're not with him.
[time=2557] You're not even close.
[time=2558] He's not on your side, I hear people,
[time=2564] I hear people just kind of mindlessly talking this way, he's not in your camp, he's not involved or in your life in any way, shape, or form, and you are not involved in his.
[time=2578] To the degree that you choose to remain independent
[time=2586] and apart from him, you are separated from God.
[time=2591] And I remember, I remember being 20 years old
[time=2599] and coming to that realization, and I remember what a lonely place that was, could there be a lonelier place, my friends,
[time=2615] than not being with him, him not being with you?
[time=2619] And yet that's what the scriptures teach.
[time=2623] We are separate, in our ungodliness, in our lack of surrender, we are separated from him.
[time=2629] Those who haven't fully surrendered are intellectually empty,
[time=2635] they're separated from God.
[time=2637] Number three, they're morally, morally insensitive.
[time=2641] Write that down and look at verse 19, if you will, they are morally insensitive.
[time=2645] This is kind of like a regression, it just kind of starts at eight, 17, and it just goes down and down and down and they, 19, and they having become callous have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness, with greediness they do this, the giving over of themselves to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity.
[time=2676] Morally insensitive, let me just say this to you,
[time=2682] and they having become callous, the hardening, don't miss this, the hardening of a heart over time, the ongoing disobedience and rebellion will lead eventually to a callous, to a callous, to a spiritual heart
[time=2702] that looks like a 47 year old man's cracked, ugly, rock-hard heel.
[time=2711] I'm up at this morning getting my shoes on after the baptism.
[time=2717] Do you know how ugly my heel is?
[time=2719] And I know you ladies don't get it 'cause you lotion and you scrub and you, whatever you do there, it takes forever by the way.
[time=2729] But if you ever look at a 50 year old man's heel, it is just hard and cracked and tough and flaky and you could step on a nail.
[time=2740] And I could walk on coals I think, as bad as the bottom of my feet are, it's just pathetic.
[time=2748] And that's the picture of a heart.
[time=2759] So hard and callous, impenetrable.
[time=2764] And this is why I, this is why I beg people.
[time=2770] You say, do you really beg people?
[time=2773] I beg people, I do, don't you?
[time=2776] I beg people who haven't fully surrendered.
[time=2783] They're hard in life to Christ to do so.
[time=2787] Because I know and many times they know the longer they live and sin, the longer you live separated from Him, the harder the heart gets.
[time=2796] Now you say, Kelly, could the heart ever get too hard?
[time=2802] Could the callous just get so tough and rough that it couldn't ever be penetrated by the grace of God answer?
[time=2813] No, there's no callous.
[time=2816] The grace of God can't soften.
[time=2819] Amen?
[time=2820] [AMEN] But I beg you today, if that's you, if that's you in this room, if that's you watching on the live stream, I beg you to stop and step back and look at the condition of your heart and look at the spiraling downward that the life in heart that hasn't fully surrendered itself to Christ experiences.
[time=2844] And if that weren't enough, look at the text, look what happens when the heart gets that hard.
[time=2852] Go back to 19.
[time=2855] It says, and they having become callous have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity.
[time=2864] It's a very interesting, very telling phrase.
[time=2867] They've given themselves over.
[time=2870] They used to have to get pulled.
[time=2873] You used to have to get dragged.
[time=2876] It used to be a battle.
[time=2879] Now you're just giving yourself over.
[time=2884] Now you're just offering yourself.
[time=2888] Now you're just engaging in it.
[time=2890] Now you're just waiting for it.
[time=2891] Now Romans 1 says you even invent ways to do it.
[time=2895] They give themselves over to evil.
[time=2901] They support it.
[time=2903] They practice it.
[time=2904] They get excited about practicing it.
[time=2910] Go back to Romans.
[time=2911] There's a verse there, Romans 1.31.
[time=2915] It's just kind of hard to read the word sometimes, but it's true.
[time=2921] And yeah, remember it was you and it was me.
[time=2924] I know it was me, I can say that.
[time=2926] Romans 1.32, and although they know the ordinance of God that those who practice such things are worthy of death, even though they know that, they not only do it, they not only do the same, but also give what?
[time=2942] Hardy approval to those who practice them.
[time=2945] You know what Hardy approval is?
[time=2947] Hardy approval is in the arena of illicit, immoral, hard, hearted conduct.
[time=2954] Hardy approval is that a boy.
[time=2959] Ha, ha, ha, you go.
[time=2962] Blow your life up, ruin your family,
[time=2968] disgrace the name of God, hurt your body.
[time=2971] Yeah, that a boy, go.
[time=2972] Hardy approval is where this goes.
[time=2977] You don't start at Hardy approval, no, but you end up at Hardy approval.
[time=2985] What a slide.
[time=2990] What a fall.
[time=2992] And if that weren't bad enough, moral insensitivity leaves to behaviorally depraved.
[time=3001] We've already read it.
[time=3003] Look there in verse 19, back to Ephesians 4.
[time=3006] Behaviorally depraved.
[time=3010] If you haven't fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ, this is where it ends up.
[time=3015] Having become callous, having given themselves over sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.
[time=3026] These phrases indicate the clear, very accurate implication
[time=3033] of a spiraling downward to a place of illicit, immoral living that is without restraint.
[time=3048] I don't know how many of you in the room ever got there.
[time=3051] I know there are a few of us who did.
[time=3056] I'd never wish it upon anybody.
[time=3060] I'd never want it for a single soul to experience.
[time=3065] Absolute utter non-restraint, but it's where it ends up.
[time=3075] It's where Godless living goes.
[time=3077] That's where life lived according to the flesh instead of life lived according to the spirit ends up.
[time=3084] Romans 128.
[time=3087] Romans 128 says, "And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a what?
[time=3099] To a depraved mind.
[time=3102] To do those things which are not proper.
[time=3112] What things are those?
[time=3116] 29 being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice, gossip, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, evil, disobedient to parents, makes the list without understanding untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful." And look at the text, go back to 419.
[time=3144] You go back to Ephesians, look at the text when this is you over time, you get what?
[time=3150] You get greedy.
[time=3151] Now you and I hear greedy, we think money.
[time=3153] We hear greedy, we think cash.
[time=3156] We hear greedy, we think about people who wanna get rich.
[time=3159] Interesting use of the word here.
[time=3161] This whole spiraling downward ends with this idea of doing all that with greediness.
[time=3168] Think about it on the money front.
[time=3173] What are financially greedy people like?
[time=3176] They want more what?
[time=3177] Say it, money, they want more money all the time.
[time=3180] They're always thinking about what?
[time=3182] Say it, money, they're selfish with their what?
[time=3184] Say it, money consumes them.
[time=3187] Money dominates their decisions.
[time=3189] Money controls their feelings.
[time=3191] Well, immorally, illicitly greedy people are the same way.
[time=3196] They want more immorality.
[time=3201] They're always thinking about immorality.
[time=3206] They're selfish with their immorality.
[time=3209] Elicit, promiscuous behavior consumes, dominates, and controls them, their decisions and their feelings.
[time=3217] And if this is you today, if this is you today and you're in this room, if this is you today and you're watching, if this is you today and you can hear my voice, however you're hearing my voice, I want to, we want to say to you how deeply we would want for you to be free.
[time=3237] To be utterly and absolutely free of intellectual emptiness, separation from God.
[time=3247] The things that we have talked about this morning, the immoral behavior, throw those points up on the screen
[time=3259] if you would, moral insensitivity,
[time=3265] depraved behavior, we wouldn't want nothing more
[time=3271] than for you to be free of that today.
[time=3276] And you can be because of the grace of God and the Spirit of God that can indwell you and give you strength and free you from the power of that spiral.
[time=3286] And see, the whole point of the passage is to you believers who have been saved from that spiral, who have been given new hope and new life, he says to you, just go back to 420, he says, but you did not learn Christ in this way if indeed you have heard him and have been taught in him just as truth is in Jesus, that in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside, you throw away, you discarded the whole self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit and that you, verse 23, be renewed in the Spirit of your mind and put on the new self, which is what we get to put on, which is what has been put on and we get to keep putting it on, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.
[time=3340] Wow.
[time=3344] Well, I hope this morning that this has been an encouragement
[time=3350] to those of you that know him and I hope you're continually putting off these things.
[time=3356] And for those of you, would you just bow your heads right now if you would, close your eyes for those of you in the room who would love nothing more than to be free of this insane, empty, futile, spiral downward this morning, you can do something about that with God's help.
[time=3375] You could just say, you could just speak in your heart words like this, Father in heaven, I know my sin has separated me from you.
[time=3385] Oh God in heaven, I know that you have offered me forgiveness from all that I have done and a hope for the future because of what your son accomplished on the cross for me.
[time=3398] You can say to him, my friends, right now you can say, God in heaven, I accept the forgiveness made possible by your son.
[time=3406] And God, I commit, I fully surrender my heart and life to you to be freed from the power and the presence of sin, to be given hope for eternity and meaning for today.
[time=3418] Oh God, I claim this.
[time=3421] God, I accept this gift of life and I commit to follow after your son.
[time=3427] You can say this, you can say, God in heaven, I'm grateful for this church and these people.
[time=3432] They seem willing and ready to help me and walk with me as I grow in my relationship, not my religion, but my relationship with your son.
[time=3444] And oh God, if there are those in the room or those watching today praying these prayers and uttering these words, we thank you for that God.
[time=3453] We praise you and your redeeming power and we commit God to walk alongside them as best we can.
[time=3459] Father in heaven, we love you.
[time=3462] We're thankful for the great truth of your word and for the admonition and the encouragement and the challenge that it brings to live life in a way that is consistent with how you've made us and how you've saved us.
[time=3477] Give us strength and courage to do that very thing.
[time=3479] In your name, we pray.
[time=3482] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=3502] (upbeat music)
