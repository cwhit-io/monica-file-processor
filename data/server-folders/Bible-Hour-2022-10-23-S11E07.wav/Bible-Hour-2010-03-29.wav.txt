[time=386] Welcome to the broadcast again.
[time=387] As most of you watch this, it's Easter Sunday morning.
[time=391] And we can't tell you what a great, great celebration.
[time=395] This is going to be at Black Hawk.
[time=396] If you're watching and you still got time to come to the 1045 or the 9 AM service, I'd encourage you to make your way.
[time=403] It is going to be a phenomenal celebration of the life that Jesus Christ has provided.
[time=409] We're so thankful that He's alive.
[time=411] And so thankful that we have life because of Him.
[time=414] Hey, I want to just say something to you this morning briefly.
[time=416] There are those of you who watch every week, and you're part of a local church family.
[time=420] We've said it before.
[time=421] We mean it.
[time=422] We're thankful for that.
[time=423] We hope that you stay involved and stay engaged in that local church family.
[time=428] Use your gifts.
[time=430] Give graciously.
[time=431] Support those who lead and do all you can to make that endeavor successful.
[time=436] But I want to just say something to those of you who don't have a church family, but really the Bible hour and the Black Hawk family has become your point of connection.
[time=446] And in some ways, I've become your pastor.
[time=449] I've met you, many of you, on the street, if you will, at the mall, at the gas station, at the grocery store.
[time=455] And you say to me, you know, I've been watching for two months or I've been watching for two years and you've become my pastor.
[time=461] And as much as that means to me and as thankful as I genuinely am for the connection God's given us, I want you to know you're missing out on all that God has intended for you.
[time=472] You're not experiencing everything that he has for you.
[time=476] And if you'll come and connect with this family, we would love nothing more than to put a face with a name and more than putting faces with names.
[time=484] We'd love to put our arms around you.
[time=486] There's something about physically being here that I would love for you to experience.
[time=491] There's something about being part of a family, not a perfect family, a very flawed family.
[time=496] If I can be honest, but it is a diverse community of disciples that God is growing here, young and old, red, yellow, black and white, professional, working class, folks who have kids, folks who don't, people who've been educated, people who haven't.
[time=512] It's an amazing family that I would love nothing more than for you to meet and become a part of.
[time=518] So come and see us.
[time=519] We've had an influx in the last three months of people who have come by virtue of the Bible hour. It's been amazing to see people making that transition from watching on the screen to being here live in the room.
[time=531] So that's our hope for you.
[time=533] We hope we get to meet you soon.
[time=535] And we hope God will continue to grow you and grow us in our relationship together.
[time=540] Hey, God bless you. Thank you for tuning in.
[time=542] Happy Resurrection Sunday.
[time=544] And as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=745] [MUSIC - 57 seconds]
[time=805] (audience applauds) - Well, we at Black Hawk are privileged
[time=817] to have a very special class, community of people.
[time=821] They themselves are very special people and I have grown and many of you have grown to love them.
[time=827] Over the years, Jan Cox leads our friendship class and this amazing group of people are coming this morning to participate in our preparation segment this morning as a height, Jan.
[time=839] As most of you know, each week over these last several, we're having a scripture reading from our preparation reading cards and asking people who are a part of our family to come and kind of participate by bringing on stage that week's symbol and this week's symbol are the palm branches and I am so grateful for Jan and Ron and others who helped with this incredible group of people who we love.
[time=864] Could you all thank them for coming up here this morning?
[time=867] (audience applauds) Great job, gang.
[time=873] It's good to have you here.
[time=879] Jan and Alan are gonna read for us this morning and so would you all give them your attention and let's go forward here with our preparation moment this morning.
[time=889] This truly is our pleasure.
[time=891] Mark 11, one through 11.
[time=895] As they approach Jerusalem at Beth Faysian Bethany near the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples and said to them, go into the village opposite you and immediately, as you enter it, you will find a coat tied there on which no one yet has ever sat on tight and bring it here.
[time=919] - If anyone says to you, why are you doing this?
[time=923] You say the Lord has need of it and immediately he'll send it back here.
[time=928] - And they went away just and found a coat tied at the door outside in the street and they untied it.
[time=938] - Some of the bystanders were saying to them, what are you doing untying the cult?
[time=944] - They spoke to them just as Jesus has told them and they gave them permission.
[time=952] - They brought the cult to Jesus and put their coats on it and he sat on it.
[time=958] - And many spread their coats in the road and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields.
[time=969] - Those who went in front and those who followed were shouting, Hosanna, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=976] Blessed is the coming kingdom of Father David, Hosanna in the highest.
[time=983] - Jesus entered Jerusalem and came into the temple and after looking around at everything, he left for Bethany with a 12 since it was already late.
[time=991] - Thank you, Allen, thanks, Jan, very much.
[time=998] (audience applauds)
[time=1004] - You know, it's been one of the real privileges of my years here has been to see you buddy, love you.
[time=1018] To stop by this room full of people and to just give them a hug and say hello
[time=1029] and it's amazing how when you just take time to get to know them, how much they want to get to know you, how they'll, thanks Dean, how they'll tell you about their day to the degree that they can.
[time=1042] They'll share their story with you and as I've heard their stories and as I've had the privilege of having their caregivers share me, share with me their stories, it's just reminded me of how broken we all are, there's looks, the way it looks, yours and mine look, the way it looks
[time=1070] and thank God that he is willing and gracious to send people along to help us and to walk with us and to love on us, amen.
[time=1082] And I'm so grateful for Jan and that team of people and so thankful for you receiving them warmly this morning.
[time=1090] Anyways, about a week ago I ended up talking with a guy at a gas station.
[time=1095] True story happens to me a lot actually.
[time=1099] We're standing there at the pump putting gas in our cars and he recognizes me from TV, from the Bible hour.
[time=1109] I don't mind when that happens oftentimes it leads to really interesting conversations.
[time=1114] In this case it did and I was really thankful.
[time=1116] The way the conversation went I won't tell you all of it but the bottom line was he was very pleasant, he was very cordially, he was very polite but he at the end of the conversation let me know that the Bible basically for him and he's watched the Bible hour, he's continued to watch but his conclusion to date was that the Bible is just too impractical for him.
[time=1141] It's too removed from the reality of his everyday life.
[time=1146] It's too much theory, it's too lofty and that was just kind of how he saw it and so what I did was I invited him to join us today.
[time=1159] I invited him to come, I was really, it was really worked out well.
[time=1163] I invited him to come and join us today for I told him we were in the last three chapters of Ephesians and that it was highly personal, extremely practical, everyday not very lofty stuff that God's word addresses in these last three chapters as God attempts to help us live out our faith in the everyday of life.
[time=1189] So he may be here with us today, if so I'm really glad you're here, we're thankful for any guest that comes and we're so thankful we get to come to this word of God week after week that fills us up and encourages us and I'm thankful you're all here as well.
[time=1207] Ephesians 4, 25, would you turn there?
[time=1210] Ephesians 4, 25.
[time=1213] Last week we were in Ephesians 4, 17 to 24,
[time=1219] now we come to 25 and there's that word again, everybody say it together, therefore, stop right there, therefore, whenever you see the word therefore you know it's just a big neon arrow back, it's just saying to you and it's saying to me, wait a minute, before you go any further, just discipline yourself in your own study of the word, discipline yourself in the gathering as we look to the word to just stop for a moment whenever you see therefore and think back just for a moment to where you've been.
[time=1252] So if we look back to where we've been, as we come to Ephesians 4, 25, it says therefore, what we remember from last week is that Paul went out of his way to communicate to believers really, he communicates to believers the life that they no longer live, he communicates to believers this life that they've laid aside, this life that they've put aside and if you look at the screens, I'm gonna take you back to the four points from last Sunday, we saw Paul showed us last week in 17 to 24 that those who haven't fully surrendered their hearts and lives to Christ, those who live outside of relationship with the Lord by virtue of that state, by virtue of them being distant from God, this is how their life unwinds, this is how their life unfolds, this is how it goes.
[time=1315] We saw this, this moral, personal, ethical, spiraling downward that goes on in the mind and heart and life and body of someone who hasn't surrendered,
[time=1329] hasn't bowed the knee of their heart to Christ, they live in electually empty, you can read all of this, 17 to 24, they lead lives that are intellectually empty spiritually, they're separated from God, morally insensitive leading to a behavioral deprivation that is just absolutely dark and awful.
[time=1354] Paul says, four things, but no longer characterize
[time=1360] your life, Paul says that's not you, as 17 to 24,
[time=1366] continued on, he said that's not you, in fact in 4.22, he reminds us, he reminded us last week that we have or we can throw away, toss aside or take off with aggression is how that phrase reads in the original language, look at 4.22 if you would, we were there last week, we touched on it just briefly, I want you to see it again this morning, that in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside in the Greek right there to take off with aggression, in the Greek it speaks to dirty clothes that need to be removed quickly.
[time=1407] You lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new self, this new self, which is in the likeness of God, this new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.
[time=1434] You're not living out that regression, that spiraling downward anymore, no, you've put on the new self and I love how 24 ends in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth, these are the clothes you wear.
[time=1452] So that's what we saw, therefore points us back
[time=1460] to this picture he paints of who we used to be, that which we have now cast off, that which we have now put on and he comes to 25 and says therefore, so here we go, therefore, in light of all you've laid aside, in 25 to 32, and I love this, I love how practical the word of God is.
[time=1486] He's going to basically say in a very non-theoretical way,
[time=1492] here's what I'm gonna tell you right now and then we're gonna come back to it.
[time=1496] Here's what the Apostle Paul is gonna tell you in me this morning is we study Ephesians 4, 25 to 32.
[time=1504] He's gonna tell you to stop lying to people, to be angry the right way, to quit stealing, get a job and work, speak gracefully with each other, not inappropriately and don't be a jerk, be nice.
[time=1521] Anybody up for here in any of those things, raise your hand.
[time=1526] Love it.
[time=1528] All right, here we go.
[time=1529] You ready?
[time=1531] The living out of our faith, the practical nitty gritty of life and he begins with stop lying.
[time=1538] Verse 25, look at it with me.
[time=1540] If you would therefore laying aside falsehood, speak truth, don't speak lies, speak truth, each one of you with his neighbor, why?
[time=1552] For we are members of one another.
[time=1557] Stop lying, he says.
[time=1562] Now listen, there's a reason that he starts with this one.
[time=1571] Oh, don't think for a moment that there's not thought put into this.
[time=1577] There is a reason, my friends, that he begins with this.
[time=1584] God, we're talking about our salvation, we're in Ephesians 4, we're talking about living out our faith, we're talking about practically putting into motion the things that are true about our salvation.
[time=1598] Now in the way we live, and I want you to know and Paul wants to tell you right here at the beginning, my friends, God saved you from lies.
[time=1612] You have been saved out of lies.
[time=1618] God has forgiven you and allowed you to live in the light,
[time=1624] in the light of the, what?
[time=1629] Truth, it's what God did.
[time=1632] God saved you from lies, God redeemed you and lets you, allows you and gives you the capacity to live life in the light of the truth.
[time=1645] Lies distort, lies destroy, lies bring darkness.
[time=1653] Satan is a liar, God is about the truth, say it with me.
[time=1661] Satan is a liar, say it louder again.
[time=1666] Satan is a liar.
[time=1670] He's a liar and God is about the truth.
[time=1675] God saved you to live in the light of the truth,
[time=1683] not in the darkness of lies.
[time=1687] Lies bring confusion, God is about clarity.
[time=1691] Don't lie, tell the what, truth.
[time=1701] Why do, why do we lie?
[time=1704] Why do we tell lies to each other?
[time=1712] And I know you, you know me right now, we all want to talk about eight year olds.
[time=1719] We all want to just take this conversations to black markers on the white wall in the back room.
[time=1727] Come on, who did it?
[time=1729] And they lie, they do.
[time=1733] And you lie and I lie.
[time=1737] We don't tell the truth.
[time=1741] Why?
[time=1743] And here's a hit.
[time=1746] The reason that you lie and the reason that I lie and the reason my eight year old lies is it's all the same reason.
[time=1756] For the most part, it's always the same reason we're afraid of what's going to happen.
[time=1764] We're afraid of what he's going to say, we're afraid of what they're going to do, we're afraid of the spanking I'm going to get, we're afraid of the consequences I'm going to face.
[time=1775] So we, what, say it, we lie.
[time=1779] And here's the great redeeming, life giving,
[time=1785] like really good news on this, my friends.
[time=1788] And I want to just, I want to say it to you.
[time=1790] I want to, I want to beg those of you who need to be begged with.
[time=1793] And I want to just remind those of you who need to be reminded.
[time=1797] Here's the thing, whatever it is you've done, whoever it is that you've become,
[time=1805] whatever it is that's transpired.
[time=1809] Hey kids, if you're the one that drew the black mark on the wall, mom or dad, if you're the one who has done whatever you've done, there isn't anything you and God together can't work out.
[time=1825] There isn't anything he can't help you face, there isn't anything he can't help you overcome, there isn't anything that you could have done or said that A will ever separate you from his love or B that he and you together with the Word of God and the Spirit of God and the people of God can't fix.
[time=1846] Do you believe that?
[time=1849] Then tell the truth and stop.
[time=1857] Last side falsehood, speak truth, each one of you with his neighbor.
[time=1864] And this is really important, this is really important.
[time=1868] Why?
[time=1870] And if I just say to you, okay, why shouldn't you lie?
[time=1873] You all say it back to me because you shouldn't lie, you should tell the truth and just set it in the Bible.
[time=1878] And I'll say, okay, that's true, but look at what else the Bible said.
[time=1882] The Bible gives us the why in this context for the body of Christ, he's talking to believers that Ephesus who are living life together, like we're living life together, and he is generally talking about lying, yeah, but specifically he's talking about lying to each other and he says, don't do it.
[time=1904] And when you wanna ask the question why, I just wanna take you to the text.
[time=1909] For we, look at it.
[time=1912] For we are members of one another.
[time=1916] Okay, gonna watch the time.
[time=1919] And this could take a while, but I'll just make it brief.
[time=1921] Here's the deal.
[time=1922] He's talking to a family.
[time=1929] He's talking to the body.
[time=1930] He's talking to brothers and sisters.
[time=1932] He's talking to this people who are a part of this community of faith together.
[time=1937] And he says, what goes on?
[time=1938] Remember how he started chapter four.
[time=1941] The moment he turned the corner from doctrine and the truth about our salvation in one, two, and three, the moment he turned the corner, the first thing he talked about was our unity and how important that was.
[time=1955] And now he's saying be truthful with each other.
[time=1959] Don't tell lies because this is a family and you're of one another.
[time=1967] And when you lie to each other, it destroys the relationship.
[time=1973] Raise your hand if you've ever been in a family that got dinged by lying.
[time=1986] See, it's just the truth.
[time=1989] If my wife and I hypothetical here, I'm so thankful she's a woman of truth.
[time=1995] If hypothetical, if my wife and I just start lying, if we just start lying, if she just lies 20 times a day, and if I lie 20 times a day, and we just start living in those lies, guess who gets utterly and absolutely affected.
[time=2015] Her and I, yeah.
[time=2016] Five kids will not be able to escape
[time=2023] the consequence and the dings and the bumps and the tears and the scrapes that come if her and I just start lying.
[time=2030] Because lying destroys relationship.
[time=2036] And when we lie in the body, when we lie in the family, we get destroyed.
[time=2045] Don't lie.
[time=2048] Tell the truth.
[time=2051] Whatever we've got to work out, we can work out.
[time=2054] Hey, and a reminder to you too, just had some great interaction this last week with some questions.
[time=2062] If you've got questions during the service, and again, this may seem weird to others, it was life giving to some others.
[time=2069] If you've got questions, you can text them to that number.
[time=2072] Right now, you can just text a question that God has put on your heart to that number, and we can even answer those questions before we get out of here today, possibly.
[time=2081] So just keep that in mind.
[time=2082] Number two, be angry.
[time=2084] Did you know the Bible says?
[time=2085] Did you know the Scriptures teach you and I to be angry?
[time=2090] This is so interesting.
[time=2093] Be angry, it says.
[time=2096] Go to the text, verses 26 and 27.
[time=2099] It says they're in Ephesians 4, 26.
[time=2102] It says, be angry, and yet do not what?
[time=2105] Sin, do not let the sun go down on your anger, and do not give the devil an opportunity, which is what you'd be giving the devil, you'd be giving him an opportunity.
[time=2115] If you let the sun go down on this anger that God has allowed you to have.
[time=2122] It's an interesting thing, watch this.
[time=2125] In the Greek language, and you know, I don't throw around the Greek to impress you, I only bring it up when I think it's pertinent, and boy, is it pertinent here, watch this.
[time=2135] In the original language, there are three Greek words that Paul could have used to communicate, be angry.
[time=2145] Says it right there, it's a quote from the Old Testament, but in the usage here in this New Testament text, as he writes this, there's three words he could have chosen.
[time=2158] One word that he didn't choose, you're with me, was the Greek word thumos, T-H-U-M-O-S, thumos.
[time=2167] And the Greek word thumos means, it means an emotional boiling over of anger.
[time=2177] We're talking ticked off, out it comes, raise the roof,
[time=2184] I'm mad, and out the words come, out the emotion comes, and it's thumos, it's really, really mad, and I'm really, really angry, and now everybody knows it.
[time=2196] And he didn't use that word.
[time=2203] So when he says, be angry, he's not giving you a green light, to thumos on everybody.
[time=2217] He didn't use the word perogysmos, too long and too hard to spell, forget about it.
[time=2226] Perogysmos, this isn't boiling over.
[time=2232] This is annoyed, irritated, bothered, exasperated.
[time=2237] This is you, you, you bug me, get out of my face.
[time=2244] This is, I'm tired of you.
[time=2245] This is, I'm annoyed with you.
[time=2248] This is, I'm frustrated with you, and you can feel it, and you can sense it.
[time=2253] I'm not like swinging at you, but you just know I am bothered with you by the way I treat you rudely, and shortly and abruptly, perogysmos, he didn't use that one.
[time=2270] So you don't get to do that.
[time=2276] But he said, be angry, so here's the third word.
[time=2281] It's the one he used, or gay, or gay.
[time=2286] And or gay describes a righteous indignation,
[time=2294] an anger that wells up inside of you and me
[time=2302] over injustice and ungodliness, and greed, selfishness, and oppression.
[time=2310] And where you see injustice, and where you see ungodliness, and where you see greed, and selfishness, and oppression, and all the things that come with those distortions of what God intended.
[time=2326] When that stirs in you this anger, when that stirs in you this sense of holy rage, God says, that's good.
[time=2336] Be angry over those things.
[time=2340] And don't sin.
[time=2343] Be careful.
[time=2346] Be angry.
[time=2347] Don't sin.
[time=2349] Don't let the sun go down, and on all of that, which is stirring in you.
[time=2360] This organ is okay, Jesus got this way.
[time=2363] You can write it down, we won't turn there, Matthew 21.
[time=2368] Jesus got this way, my friends.
[time=2370] Jesus got really, really mad.
[time=2374] He got angry with the Pharisees, the religious leaders of that day.
[time=2381] Why?
[time=2381] He was, I rate with them because they were literally keeping people out of heaven.
[time=2390] And there wasn't anything more ungodly.
[time=2392] There wasn't anything more unjust to him than that.
[time=2396] They were keeping people out of heaven.
[time=2400] Their religion was destroying relationship with God and their greed, and their pride, and their injustice leads to one of the greatest gasket-blowing events of all scripture,
[time=2418] where he just walks into that temple, and he just starts kicking tables over and throwing things around, and yelling at them, raising his voice.
[time=2430] Somebody asked me, do you think he screamed?
[time=2433] I think he screamed.
[time=2434] I think he waved his hands, and I think he raised his voice, and I think he shook his finger in their face, and I think he got in their grill.
[time=2447] And I think he scared them out of them.
[time=2451] 'Cause it was wrong.
[time=2456] And God says, be angry about that, which is wrong,
[time=2463] but don't sleep on it.
[time=2467] This is interesting to read about this this week, but don't sleep on it.
[time=2477] I'm not sure, and I'm always honest with you about this stuff, I'm not really sure about this one, but I'm gonna tell you what I think it means, from the reading, and from the asking, and from the listening I've been doing.
[time=2491] Here's what I believe it means.
[time=2494] What I believe it means is this.
[time=2497] That stuff should stir you.
[time=2501] That stuff should light something up inside of us when we see injustice and oppression.
[time=2508] It should break our heart, and it should make us wanna do something about it.
[time=2512] It should rev your jets, but here's the thing, if you and I sleep on that, if we keep that, if we hold on to that, if all of a sudden now we sleep on it, and a week goes by, and a month goes by, and a year goes by, and all we're doing with this is thinking about it and stewing on it, and making plans about it.
[time=2535] Then what can happen is it can become bitterness, it can become edgy, it can become sharp, it can become that which lacks the hand and the spirit of God.
[time=2548] See, don't let the sun go down in that day, and at the end of the day, you give it back to him.
[time=2556] And I don't know how else to say this to you other than, I think it would just be you and I, not just with whatever this is saying to him at night, I am so sad that this is the way this is, it breaks my heart to see this going on.
[time=2570] Oh God, I know that you're a God who is in control, would you please in your time and place move, and God, would you please give me the strength and the knowledge and the discernment to know what I should do and what I shouldn't?
[time=2583] Does this make sense?
[time=2586] I'm still mad, I'm still angry, but I'm giving it back to you, and I'm gonna go to sleep now and when I wake up, we'll pick it up wherever you want me to pick it up, but I've given it to you.
[time=2600] Quit stealing, quit stealing, get a job and work,
[time=2618] right from the pages of Scripture, Ephesians 4.28, read it with me, Ephesians 4.28.
[time=2625] He who steals must steal no longer, I love that, how's that?
[time=2631] He who steals must steal no longer, stop it.
[time=2634] But rather than stealing, so you gotta need, you're hungry, whatever it is, stop stealing to have your needs met, but rather he must labor, another word for work, another way of saying get a job, performing with his own hands what is good so that he will have something, oh look, now he's accumulating, but what's he accumulating for?
[time=2664] Stop stealing, get a job, work, so that he will have something to put in his bank account,
[time=2675] is that what it says?
[time=2677] So that he will have something to hold on to, so he won't be needy anymore, is that what it says?
[time=2683] So he will have something to share with another who has what need.
[time=2690] See in God's economy, the way this works is you don't work to have, you work to give.
[time=2698] But we get that really, really screwed up.
[time=2705] You work, you who are needy, get a job and work so that you can give to those who are needy.
[time=2714] 'Cause you remember what it was like to be needy, don't you?
[time=2719] Quit stealing, quit being dishonest,
[time=2725] quit taking what's not yours.
[time=2727] Work hard to everything within your power.
[time=2732] And with what God provides, make sure as you take care of your own that you're willing to take care of others.
[time=2738] Speak gracefully, wanna live out your faith in a practical everyday way with each other.
[time=2746] In the body of Christ, here we go, speak gracefully with each other, not inappropriately.
[time=2753] Verse 29, look at it with me.
[time=2756] Let no unwholesome word, unwholesome, amazing word there.
[time=2761] The word for unwholesome refers to that which is foul or rotten, such as spoiled fruit or rotten meat.
[time=2772] Get the picture?
[time=2775] Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment so that it will give grace to those who hear.
[time=2792] So again, the context, remember, always remembering the context, so when dealing with each other verbally, this isn't about what you say when you slam your finger in the door, all right?
[time=2807] We can go to some other passages and talk about what you say when you slam your finger in the door.
[time=2812] This isn't about that.
[time=2814] This is about what you say to each other.
[time=2818] This is about what we say, what does the text say?
[time=2821] It's what we say within a moment when a situation has arisen, when something has transpired and we need to talk, when some things come up, be it good or bad, be it positive or negative, when a moment has arisen and we need to speak, he tells us how
[time=2848] that speech is to be exercised, speak words that just three things, speak words that edify, speak words that edify.
[time=2858] Here's three things about words that edify.
[time=2860] Words that edify are instructive, encouraging, uplifting,
[time=2878] I love this, we just got a question in upstairs.
[time=2883] You could put it on the screen, Beth, if you want to, if you can.
[time=2886] Somebody here in the room says, isn't falsehood, isn't falsehood also when we are fake with each other?
[time=2895] What do you think, yes or no?
[time=2899] Yeah, really good point, whoever wrote that in, isn't falsehood also when we are fake with each other and when we are not brave enough to speak the truth into others' lives, isn't this also telling a lie?
[time=2914] It's true, it's really true.
[time=2917] Great insight, thanks for sending that in.
[time=2920] Words that edify, listen, instructive, encouraging, uplifting.
[time=2927] When a moment arises and you and I have something that we need to say to somebody in the body, good, say it and it should be instructive, encouraging and uplifting.
[time=2937] Speech, words that edify, not unwholesome words.
[time=2944] You say what are unwholesome words?
[time=2947] I gave you the definition, but in essence, again, by virtue of the context, it's just words that don't edify.
[time=2953] Words that don't edify, stay away verbally, stay away from words that don't edify.
[time=2960] If the word doesn't encourage, if the word doesn't lift up, don't say it.
[time=2965] It's the thumper rule from Bambi.
[time=2967] If you can't say something nice, what?
[time=2970] I always just say shut up, but we can do it your way.
[time=2976] And it's so important and again, it doesn't matter if it's a good thing that needs to be addressed or a bad thing, it's the words that don't edify that lead to so much trouble.
[time=2988] You think you have struggles with this, I'm the chief sinner on this one.
[time=2996] And I can take you to all kinds of arenas in my life.
[time=3001] But we can just go to dinner.
[time=3005] And the seven of us around our table with an amazing dish that Kevris prepared, we got a huge bowl full of pasta and beef and sauce and vegetables and it's just an amazing thing.
[time=3019] And we've kind of learned over the years, we'll throw a few three or four big spoons in there.
[time=3024] And here's the rule, you take your plate to the bowl.
[time=3028] You don't stick the spoon in, try to balance four pounds of noodles and beef all the way over across the table to your plate.
[time=3036] Do I hear an amen from any parent?
[time=3039] So there it happens, inevitably it happens.
[time=3045] Three do it great and all of a sudden the fourth one comes along and boom, he or she thinks they can somehow do it and they're halfway across.
[time=3052] And now everyone's realizing what they've done and they're all looking away and they're like scared cats hiding under the table and dad's gonna blow and sure enough, boom, and down go the noodles.
[time=3063] Down goes the sauce, half of it in my water.
[time=3067] (audience laughing) And there's this line that I use.
[time=3072] I don't know where I got it, it's so bad.
[time=3074] It's so ineffective, it's so wrong.
[time=3077] But I'll look at him or her and I'll say, "So let me get this straight." (audience laughing) You really thought in your mind that that was gonna be a good idea.
[time=3087] (audience laughing) The tears well up and shrink down in the seat.
[time=3094] I do that, I'm sorry I do that.
[time=3098] I wanna keep getting better at not doing that because all I would have to say, the only thing I would have to say, say Jake, come here.
[time=3113] You see that noodle in my water?
[time=3118] (audience laughing) And he'd just be, if that's all I said to him, his eyes would just wall up with tears and he'd just say, "I'm sorry dad." And I could just say it's all right, it's just noodle.
[time=3135] In my water.
[time=3136] (audience laughing) But no, I gotta go animate it on him.
[time=3141] Speak words that edify, not unwholesome words
[time=3148] that don't, according to, this is important, according, wow, it got late, sorry.
[time=3152] According to the need of the moment, whatever the listen, whatever the moment may call for,
[time=3160] praise or pullin' somebody aside, you should verbally edify.
[time=3168] You should verbally edify.
[time=3172] You can confront, you can correct, you can get in someone's grill and you can do it all graciously.
[time=3180] You really can.
[time=3182] Last one, don't be a jerk, be nice.
[time=3185] Don't be a jerk, be nice, look with me at 31,
[time=3191] let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander.
[time=3199] Notice all those are sins of the what?
[time=3201] Tongue.
[time=3202] Pretty important that you think about what you say.
[time=3207] Let all bitterness and how you say it.
[time=3212] Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you along with all malice.
[time=3218] Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.
[time=3228] I see this more and more clearly, the older I get.
[time=3231] And I'll just say it to you this way, gracious, forgiving, tenderhearted, niceness solves a lot of problems.
[time=3241] Nice, nice, just nice, nice, nice.
[time=3248] Nice solves a lot of problems.
[time=3253] And if you're questioning me on that
[time=3259] or if you're struggling with that at all, just remember it solved, it solved all of yours.
[time=3264] Because it's what he was to you.
[time=3269] Just as God in Christ also has forgiven you
[time=3278] so how do we do this?
[time=3282] You say, wow, that's an amazing 35 minutes packed with a lot that I want to be, how do I do this?
[time=3291] Well, I missed a verse and I'm gonna have you look at it as you stand, would you do that?
[time=3295] Would you stand this morning and would you look at verse 30?
[time=3297] 'Cause here's how we do this.
[time=3300] Here's how not to do it, how not to do it is to grieve the Holy Spirit of God, but he says, don't grieve, don't grieve
[time=3315] the Holy Spirit of God, the only way you accomplish what we've talked about today, other slide.
[time=3323] Hey, Seuss, if you will, on the how question is a constant earnest yielding to the control of the Holy Spirit in your everyday life and if you have to write it on a card and few verses and a written out prayer where you beg him to fill you and control you and leads you, write it out and put it on your mirror in the car, on your mirror in the bathroom, get on your knees when you wake up, go somewhere and hide on your knees at lunch, do it before you go to bed, remind yourself all day, have a friend call you, text you or email you.
[time=3362] It doesn't matter, stop at nothing to put at the forefront of your mind all day long.
[time=3368] If you're like me, you need it.
[time=3371] Holy Spirit of God, I submit to you in your movement in me, oh please, Spirit of God, fill me, help me, control my words and my thoughts
[time=3385] and my actions and when you earnestly and I, when we earnestly, constantly yield to the Spirit of God, we're led by the Spirit, we don't grieve it.
[time=3397] And those kinds of things we just looked at begin to take place.
[time=3404] These are the kinds of choices we start to make, amen?
[time=3408] Father in heaven, we stand convicted and guilty
[time=3414] and at the same time grateful and hopeful for the progress and growth God, we believe you want to continue to make in our lives on these fronts.
[time=3425] We do want to lay aside the old man and God we do want to put on the new man created in righteousness and holiness.
[time=3437] God, these are the clothes that we wanna wear and the things we've looked at today God, these are the activities and the mindsets and the choices that we wanna make and yet we leave here today realizing there's only one way for that to happen is that and that's for us to be yielded and surrendered to the Spirit of God and the Word of God constantly so God, whatever we've gotta do, whatever choices we have to make, whatever help we have to ask for, God allow us to have the courage to do that so that these things can become more and more a reality for us, we love you.
[time=3477] Father and we look forward to being together again soon and all the people in the room agreed and said,
[time=3484] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=3499] (upbeat music)
