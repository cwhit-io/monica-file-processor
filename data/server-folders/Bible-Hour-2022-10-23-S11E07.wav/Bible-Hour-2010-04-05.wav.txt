[time=30] As we prepare to celebrate this morning, let's just take a few minutes to reflect on these
[time=37] past few weeks.
[time=38] We remember what he has done for us.
[time=40] We remember his holy covenant.
[time=43] Lord, may we keep his character and his behavior in the forefront of our minds so that our
[time=49] lives would model his.
[time=51] The pitcher in the basin remind us of the humble service that our Lord displayed as he washed his disciples' feet.
[time=58] He got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
[time=63] Humble, Father, may we always serve like Jesus served, the bread and the wine, symbolic
[time=70] of Christ's sacrifice on the cross.
[time=73] He himself, for our sins and his body on the tree, that we might die to sins and live
[time=79] for righteousness.
[time=81] Crucified Creator, may we fully live for righteousness and completely die to sin.
[time=89] What shame he must have felt is they used a whip to beat him for crimes he never committed.
[time=97] I offered my back to those who beat me, my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard.
[time=102] I did not hide my face from mocking or spitting.
[time=106] In a sick God, only you are worthy to be praised for being the spotless lamb who was slain.
[time=114] The crown of thorns reminds us of his bittersweet sorrow.
[time=121] King of kings, your crown of thorns is now a crown of beauty and righteousness.
[time=128] The nails, the cross, may we never forget the sufferings of Jesus.
[time=133] They will look on me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns
[time=139] for an only child, and grieve bitterly as one grieves for a firstborn son.
[time=144] Crucified Christ, you are alive, and all who are in Christ are made alive in you.
[time=153] The palm branch began his week of absolute submission to the will of his father.
[time=157] Abba Father, he said, "Everything is possible for you.
[time=162] Take this cup from me, yet not what I will, but what you will."
[time=169] Perfect prefect, may your kingdom come, may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[time=177] And today, a lily, representing his pure and holy sovereignty.
[time=182] I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth.
[time=188] Sovereign Savior, you are alive and risen today.
[time=195] This preparation has led to today, a day when we celebrate the day of all days.
[time=202] The day Jesus Christ rose from the grave.
[time=210] The crown of thorns is sacred, brow, nail pierced hands reaching out.
[time=221] Redeeming love, no greater love.
[time=230] You choose to lose your life, crucified sacrifice, I'm overcome, I'm overcome.
[time=246] Christ is lifted up, Christ is lifted up.
[time=255] Christ is lifted up, and I bow down.
[time=262] The precious love who sinners slay, the wrath of God sees on my shame, and I'm undying.
[time=284] Oh, the Father's face turns away, the reason why is it my name, it's all too much.
[time=301] Christ is lifted up, Christ is lifted up, Christ is lifted up, and I bow down.
[time=324] Lived high, oh, dine Savior, crucified your life surrendered, glorified your rise in
[time=335] power, magnified your reign forever, lifted high, oh, dine Savior, crucified your life
[time=347] surrendered, glorified your rise in power, magnified your reign forever.
[time=359] Lived high, crucified your life surrendered, glorified your rise in power, magnified your
[time=374] life forever.
[time=393] Every song I'll ever sing, and every gift I'll ever bring, it's not enough.
[time=404] It's not enough, no, so take my life, it's yours my King, I lay down my everything.
[time=419] You lifted up, Jesus, you lifted up, Christ is lifted up, Christ is lifted up, Christ is
[time=447] lifted up, Christ is lifted up, Christ is lifted up, Christ is lifted up, and I bow down.
[time=477] Oh, I bow down, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
[time=499] quiet.
[time=500] Why?
[time=501] What is it?
[time=502] Did you hear something?
[time=503] Quiet.
[time=504] Maybe I did, look we can't just stay in here, I've got to get out of here, quiet, you'll
[time=510] give us all away, he's right.
[time=513] If you leave now they'll catch you, but it'll be a dozen of us all, right, let's stay calm.
[time=519] We hide here until things blow over, and then we can slip away at night, maybe in a couple days or so, if they catch us, what then?
[time=527] Well, it's our word against theirs, we'll just deny him, if we knew him.
[time=535] And what would you have done, denied him?
[time=538] Like Peter?
[time=539] No.
[time=540] Well, I don't know, maybe.
[time=544] I thought no, certainly not, but I'm so confused.
[time=550] It seems hopeless, why didn't he save himself?
[time=553] This cannot be happening, Jesus would not abandon us.
[time=556] I mean, I must be dreaming, I've got to wake up, somebody pinch me, you shh, I'm going
[time=562] to wake up from this nightmare, and it's all going to be over.
[time=565] Yes, I denied him, but I didn't kill him, I tried to save him, I was the only one who
[time=572] acted, you saw what I did to that guard's ear with my sword, I tried to defend him,
[time=580] but he wouldn't let me.
[time=581] Let's go.
[time=582] Yes, let's go, if they capture us, they'll kill us.
[time=585] It's just as well.
[time=587] Are you kidding me?
[time=588] I want to go, I want to escape, I want to live, if they catch us they'll kill us all.
[time=593] John, Peter, he's gone, he's not there, he's gone.
[time=598] Calm down Mary, what are you saying?
[time=599] Calm down, no you don't understand, his body is gone, he's not there.
[time=604] What are you saying?
[time=605] We went to the tomb, with the murr and the frankincense, to anoint his body, but when we got there, it was gone.
[time=612] No, it can't be.
[time=614] Peter, he's gone.
[time=615] Peter, they placed guards at the entrance of the tomb, he can't be gone.
[time=620] He's gone Thomas, I'm telling you, he's gone.
[time=624] Maybe you're at the wrong tomb.
[time=625] No, we went to the tomb, we knew which tomb it was, it was sealed with a large boulder and we were wondering how we were going to bribe the temple guards to open it for us.
[time=634] But when we got there, the stone was rolled away and the tomb was completely empty.
[time=640] But the guards at the entrance, he can't be gone.
[time=642] I'm telling you Thomas.
[time=644] I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.
[time=646] What about the stone?
[time=648] I don't know how the stone was moved and it doesn't matter.
[time=652] What matters is that we're looking for the living among the dead.
[time=655] That's ridiculous.
[time=656] Oh Thomas, you got to hear the rest of the story, I know I'm just babbling, but we went
[time=662] to the tomb and we were crying, the stone, it was rolled away, his body gone.
[time=668] We didn't know what to do and then these two men came out of nowhere, we were so scared.
[time=674] They just fell face down on the ground.
[time=676] The oil, I dropped it and it smashed, I was trembling.
[time=680] The tomb men turned to us and said, "Why do you look for the living among the dead?"
[time=686] He's not here, he's risen.
[time=690] We watched him die, they crucified him, nailed him to a cross, Jesus is dead.
[time=696] Yes, yes he died, but he's risen.
[time=701] It's impossible, give it a rest Mary, it's over.
[time=705] Not over, it's just beginning.
[time=708] Peter, what'd you find?
[time=711] Mary was right, I went into the tomb before John, the wrappings were there, but that
[time=717] was all.
[time=718] I saw it too, nobody, just the cloth, but what could this mean?
[time=722] I don't know.
[time=723] What can it mean?
[time=724] On you know.
[time=725] What can it mean?
[time=726] Don't you see?
[time=727] He is alive.
[time=728] He has risen.
[time=729] Can it be?
[time=730] It has to be.
[time=731] He is alive.
[time=732] Let's go.
[time=733] Come on.
[time=734] You are stronger.
[time=736] Sin is broken.
[time=737] You have saved me.
[time=738] He is written.
[time=739] Christ is risen.
[time=740] Jesus, you are Lord of all.
[time=741] You are strong.
[time=743] Sin is broken.
[time=744] You have saved me.
[time=745] He is written.
[time=746] Christ is risen.
[time=747] Jesus, you are Lord of all.
[time=748] You are strong.
[time=751] Sin is broken.
[time=752] You have saved me.
[time=754] He is written.
[time=755] Christ is risen.
[time=756] Jesus, you are Lord of all.
[time=757] You are strong.
[time=767] There is love that came for us.
[time=772] I'm all to the sinners cross.
[time=777] You brought my shame and sinfulness.
[time=782] Those I can make for your food.
[time=789] Faithfulness and denying through the storm and through the fire.
[time=806] There is truth that sets me free.
[time=811] Jesus Christ who lives in me.
[time=818] You are stronger.
[time=823] Sin is broken.
[time=826] You have saved me.
[time=828] He is written.
[time=831] Christ is risen.
[time=833] Jesus, you are Lord of all.
[time=841] No beginning hell or end.
[time=851] You are my hope and my defense.
[time=856] You came to seek and save the loss.
[time=861] You paid it all upon the cross.
[time=869] You are stronger.
[time=874] Sin is broken.
[time=877] You have saved me.
[time=881] He is written.
[time=882] Christ is risen.
[time=885] Jesus, you are Lord of all.
[time=907] Sin is lifted higher.
[time=925] [MUSIC - 217 seconds]
[time=1146] (audience applauds) - Good morning.
[time=1154] So very glad you're here today.
[time=1157] I am the student ministry pastor here, and Kelly is out, he is with his family.
[time=1162] He's where he should be.
[time=1164] His oldest boy, Russell T, is going off to school next year, and that is a huge transition when the youngest goes off to school.
[time=1172] And I'm so thankful that we have a church, we have a people who are okay with our pastor being committed, deeply committed to his family.
[time=1182] And so if we wanted to measure ministry by numbers, it doesn't matter.
[time=1188] We're gonna measure ministry by how great a preacher we are.
[time=1191] It doesn't matter.
[time=1192] But he has a great family, and his kids are wonderful.
[time=1196] And that's why I think Kelly Bird is a great pastor.
[time=1199] So you have me this morning.
[time=1202] Welcome, I'm glad you're here.
[time=1204] You do have a bag, go ahead and pull that out.
[time=1206] You can open it up.
[time=1207] I'll be walking you through some things today.
[time=1211] And so just get that ready.
[time=1213] I'm gonna get mine ready.
[time=1215] So I have to dig in the bag there.
[time=1217] That'd be awesome.
[time=1220] We are thankful.
[time=1221] This is your first time.
[time=1222] We're glad you're here.
[time=1223] If this is your 300th time, we're glad you're here.
[time=1226] That's right.
[time=1229] It's great to be celebrating the resurrection with all the Christians around the globe, the people in Fort Wayne, the people in Indy, the people in California, all over America and all over the world.
[time=1241] We are gathered together to lift up and remember and celebrate Jesus Christ and what he did on the cross.
[time=1249] And that death couldn't hold him down.
[time=1253] That's a beautiful thing.
[time=1255] Now, today here's how it's gonna work a little bit.
[time=1257] If you've ever rented or purchased a DVD and you bring it home and you open it up, you put it in the player and you wade through all the warnings and if you steal this, we'll come and shoot you and find you and all the stuff that they say.
[time=1273] FBI, it's a mean business.
[time=1276] And then you wade through the previews and all the stuff.
[time=1279] And finally, you get to the menu page where it's like scene selection and bonus features and all this, you play movie and maybe there's a game if it's like a kids DVD which my kids have.
[time=1290] There's an interactive game that they can play with questions.
[time=1293] It's pretty cool.
[time=1294] But I want to focus on that scene selection.
[time=1296] That's kind of what I've done this morning.
[time=1298] I've just kind of pulled out some scenes from the gospels and we're just gonna walk through them.
[time=1303] I'm gonna talk about them a little bit.
[time=1305] So that's what we're doing.
[time=1306] We're scene selecting.
[time=1308] And so, let's pray together this morning.
[time=1314] Very glad you're here.
[time=1316] God, we come before you today humble and in awe of what you have done.
[time=1325] Your redemptive plan that you worked through Christ is amazing.
[time=1333] Not only did you work it through Christ but you've made a way so that we can know you and have a relationship with you.
[time=1344] We're just in awe of you, God, today.
[time=1349] May your spirit fill us and lead us and direct us and teach us to fall more in love with you today.
[time=1357] In Christ's name, amen.
[time=1360] The first scene is it begins before time began when God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit, they're all together.
[time=1369] Completely in love, complete unity, perfect, glorifying one another.
[time=1374] Before time even begins, Father, Son, Holy Spirit, they're there together.
[time=1379] They're chilling in eternal time and they're just there.
[time=1384] And because of sin in the garden, sin entered our world that broke things.
[time=1388] God's redemptive action comes to us.
[time=1393] He sends us His Son.
[time=1395] See, Jesus came down.
[time=1397] He willingly surrenders His divinity so that He could come to our level and be with us.
[time=1406] He took on a physical body in order to represent us, humanity.
[time=1413] John 1 14 says, "The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us." He came down.
[time=1422] One of the best scriptures I think that captures this is in Philippians.
[time=1426] I think at one point it was probably a hymn.
[time=1429] It says this, "Your attitude should be the same of that of Christ Jesus, who, being in the very nature of God, did not consider His quality with God something to be grasped, but made Himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness, and being found in the appearance as a man." He humbled Himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross.
[time=1454] He came on shoes.
[time=1455] Jesus came down.
[time=1457] He wore clothes.
[time=1458] He wore shoes, probably not like this, but I think if Jesus was here, He'd probably wear Nike's.
[time=1464] But He wore shoes.
[time=1466] He ate.
[time=1467] He struggled with the things we struggled with.
[time=1470] He was fully human.
[time=1475] And that is where our story begins.
[time=1477] Jesus coming to our level as a man.
[time=1481] The next scene, if you want to get your little square out, the white square, it's a dryer sheet.
[time=1489] You can go ahead and smell that as I read.
[time=1492] If you have allergies, don't.
[time=1495] A bunch of people sneezing.
[time=1497] Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus raised from the dead.
[time=1503] Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honor.
[time=1506] Martha served with Lazarus while it was among those reclining at the table.
[time=1511] Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard and expensive perfume.
[time=1515] She poured it on His feet and wiped His feet with her hair and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
[time=1524] And Judas was there and he didn't like this.
[time=1526] He was like, "What are you doing?" We could sell that and give the money to the poor.
[time=1530] He didn't care about the poor.
[time=1532] He just wanted to take the money.
[time=1533] He wanted to steal the money.
[time=1534] And Jesus said, "Hey, hey, leave her alone."
[time=1540] Leave her alone.
[time=1541] It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.
[time=1546] You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.
[time=1550] You see, Mary's act of worship.
[time=1553] It was pure.
[time=1555] It was passionate.
[time=1556] It doesn't always make sense.
[time=1558] Sometimes gifts we give don't make sense.
[time=1561] Our devotion to Christ sometimes doesn't make sense to the world.
[time=1566] But it was pure and it was passionate and it was real and it was expensive and it was extravagant.
[time=1572] One commentary wrote her said that the family, the marriage family, probably wasn't rich so that this perfume was probably a family heirloom.
[time=1579] It had been passed down.
[time=1582] It was very expensive.
[time=1584] And she pours it on his feet.
[time=1586] And she takes her hair and she wipes it off.
[time=1589] Some of us in the room, we don't even like our own feet.
[time=1592] And she uses her hair to touch Jesus' feet.
[time=1596] It was pure and real and passionate.
[time=1600] So let me ask you this.
[time=1601] How was your worship today?
[time=1604] And we woke up and we came to this room and we're here and there's all these lights and flowers and band and it's about right here.
[time=1615] It's not about up here.
[time=1618] It's about our worship.
[time=1620] Is it pure?
[time=1622] Is it real?
[time=1624] We put on these uncomfortable clothes.
[time=1626] I sure hope I don't have to wear this in heaven, as Carmen said.
[time=1630] This is a lot like heaven.
[time=1631] I sure hope we don't have to wear these clothes in heaven.
[time=1634] These are so uncomfortable.
[time=1640] But we get up and we come because we want to honor and remember.
[time=1643] But how is our worship here?
[time=1645] Is its fragrance pleasing to the Lord?
[time=1648] Does it touch the heart of Jesus?
[time=1653] The next scene.
[time=1655] If you've ever watched a movie and sometimes in movies they use great way, they use this music to kind of indicate what's going to happen.
[time=1664] This is part of when the music gets a little eerie.
[time=1668] And we know in some movies you're like, oh, don't go in there.
[time=1672] No, don't go in there.
[time=1674] You know, because you know about the music, something bad is going to happen.
[time=1678] You just know it.
[time=1679] She's going to die.
[time=1681] Oh, don't go in there.
[time=1685] So this is where the music changes.
[time=1687] In chapter 12 the one called Judas went to the chief priest and he asked, what are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?
[time=1697] So they counted out for him 30 silver coins.
[time=1701] And from then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
[time=1705] Judas was one of Jesus' closest friends.
[time=1707] He was one of the disciples.
[time=1708] He followed him.
[time=1709] He saw things.
[time=1710] He heard things.
[time=1711] He witnessed Jesus healing people, loving people.
[time=1716] If you have your coin, go ahead and hold that in your hand.
[time=1727] If 30 silver coins was today, money today, it's about 25 bucks.
[time=1733] 30 silver coins was the common price of a slave in those days.
[time=1738] If you hold this in your hand, it represents how quickly and how easily we are going to
[time=1745] easily we are bought.
[time=1747] How quickly and easily we sell out Jesus for sins, for cheap sins that will never ever satisfy.
[time=1758] We sell him out.
[time=1759] What are you selling Jesus out today?
[time=1762] Your heart tempted to betray Jesus.
[time=1765] One of my favorite pastors used to say, Satan will get you to sell your dreams for porridge.
[time=1772] Are you selling your dreams?
[time=1774] Are you selling your devotion to Christ this morning?
[time=1778] I hope not.
[time=1780] The next scene Jesus was talking about that somebody is going to betray him.
[time=1785] And then he says, after he said that, Jesus was trouble in spirit and he testified.
[time=1790] I tell you the truth, one of you is going to betray me.
[time=1793] His disciples stared at one another.
[time=1795] They were well confused at a loss to which one of them he meant.
[time=1799] One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved was declining next to him.
[time=1802] Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and asked and said, ask him which one he means.
[time=1809] Lining him back against Jesus, he asked him, Lord, who is it?
[time=1814] Jesus answered, it is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.
[time=1820] Then dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, son of Simon.
[time=1824] As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.
[time=1828] Jesus said, what you are about to do do quickly.
[time=1831] Now last service, I had them eat the bread, but somebody said, it tastes like dryer sheet.
[time=1840] So it is up to you, you do not have to eat the bread.
[time=1844] But what the bread represents is Jesus was celebrating the Passover, the feast with his disciples.
[time=1852] And just think about the heartbreak that Jesus must have been feeling, knowing what Judas was going to do.
[time=1865] Who is going to betray him?
[time=1867] Just to say, sold him out.
[time=1870] Think how much that must have hurt Christ.
[time=1873] And so the idea of the bread was to take it to eat it.
[time=1877] And maybe there is somebody who has betrayed you today.
[time=1880] Maybe there is somebody who has hurt you very, very deeply.
[time=1884] And you are holding that.
[time=1886] You are holding on to that bitterness and you are angry.
[time=1889] You do not like that person.
[time=1892] Maybe it is time to take that bread.
[time=1894] Maybe we just break it.
[time=1896] We can just break ourselves from that.
[time=1899] We can give that to God and say, God, will you heal me?
[time=1903] Help me to forgive them.
[time=1908] Maybe he will break us of that today.
[time=1913] The next thing, this is my favorite.
[time=1916] I would, yeah, this is, yeah.
[time=1919] You can take your little cup.
[time=1921] You have a little cup.
[time=1922] You can hold on to that.
[time=1927] Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane.
[time=1930] And he said to them, sit here while I go over there and pray.
[time=1934] He was a peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him.
[time=1940] And he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
[time=1944] Then he said to them, my soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death.
[time=1950] Stay here and keep watch with me.
[time=1954] Going a little further, he fell with his face to the ground and he prayed.
[time=1961] Let's look at the scene.
[time=1963] Look at the humanity of Jesus.
[time=1965] Look at the sorrow to the point of death.
[time=1967] And he says this, my father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me.
[time=1978] And he prays this, probably one of my favorite prayers, yet not as I will, but as you will.
[time=1988] He does this two more times.
[time=1993] My father, if it is not possible, he says this, my father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away, unless I drink it.
[time=2001] May your will be done.
[time=2008] The scene just shows the heart of Jesus, the sorrow, and the overwhelm, the intensity of that prayer.
[time=2018] You can almost hear his voice.
[time=2021] One gospel account records that Jesus actually dripped blood.
[time=2029] And he prayed probably the hardest prayer any one of us can pray, not as I will, but as you will.
[time=2035] There are things in the Christian life I don't want to do.
[time=2038] There are certain things, there's attitudes and actions and reactions that I don't want to have to do that.
[time=2044] There are so many things that I don't want to do, and it comes down to a simple, what do I need to surrender?
[time=2050] What's in your cup today that you need to turn over fully and completely to Jesus Christ?
[time=2057] What is it?
[time=2058] Maybe today, for the first time, you need to surrender your heart and your life, all of you to Christ.
[time=2064] Maybe Easter Sunday is that Sunday that you decide to stop playing games.
[time=2070] You've been coming to church yet, it's cool.
[time=2073] But maybe for the first time, you're like, "Yeah, I want to pray that prayer, God." Not as I will, but as you will.
[time=2082] Maybe that's you today.
[time=2084] What is in your cup that you need to surrender to Christ?
[time=2089] The next scene, while he was still speaking, a crowd came up, he can grab your rope.
[time=2096] A crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them.
[time=2103] He approached Jesus to kiss him, but Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
[time=2112] When Jesus' followers saw what was going on, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?" They were like, "Should we fight, Lord? Should we take him on?" And one of them struck the servant of the High Priest, and he cut off his ear.
[time=2127] And Jesus said, "Nay, woah, woah, no more. Stop, no more of this." And he healed the very person that had come to take him away, he healed him.
[time=2138] Tremendous scene here.
[time=2141] Then Jesus said to the chief priest, the officer of the temple garden, and the elders who had come for him, he said, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?
[time=2152] Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you do not lay a hand on me.
[time=2158] But this is your hour when darkness reigns." At every point, Jesus submitted to the difficult way of the cross.
[time=2168] He allowed himself to be bound and arrested, either with rope or chains, and we've used rope.
[time=2175] He allowed himself to be taken. He didn't fight, he didn't run, he didn't flee, he didn't cause an uproar.
[time=2183] He didn't start fighting, didn't take up arms. He allowed himself to be taken.
[time=2192] He chose to obey his father every step of the way.
[time=2198] Jesus' trial.
[time=2201] Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
[time=2209] But Peter followed him at a distance right up to the courtyard of the high priest.
[time=2216] He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome. The chief priests and the whole Sanhedron were looking for false evidence against Jesus
[time=2225] so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any.
[time=2230] Though many false witnesses came forward.
[time=2236] You can take your purple fabric, just hold it in your hand.
[time=2240] Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the petroleum and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.
[time=2248] They stripped him. They put a scarlet robe on him and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head.
[time=2256] They put a staff in his right hand and knelt the front of him and mocked him, "Hail, King of the Jews," they said.
[time=2263] They spit on him and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.
[time=2271] After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him.
[time=2275] Then they led him away to be crucified.
[time=2278] Take the fabric in your hand and I just want you to, this usually purple represents royalty, but Jesus was treated like a criminal.
[time=2289] They mocked him and they beat him and I want you to just close your eyes.
[time=2294] I want you to visualize that scene.
[time=2298] All the people screaming, the guards mocking, beating him, laughing, enjoying it, enjoying the pain that they're causing him.
[time=2311] It was recreation for them.
[time=2314] If you could get close enough to Jesus, if you were right there and you could whisper something into his ear, what would you whisper to him?
[time=2323] Just take a few seconds and think, what would you whisper to Jesus?
[time=2353] As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon and they forced him to carry the cross.
[time=2363] If you, there should be a piece of paper for you, you can go ahead and pull that out.
[time=2371] They came to a place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
[time=2375] There they offered Jesus wine to drink mixed with gold.
[time=2379] But after tasting it, he refused to drink it.
[time=2382] When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
[time=2386] And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.
[time=2389] Above his head, they placed the written charge again, and this is Jesus, the king of the Jews, robbers to his left and right.
[time=2401] And they mocked him, save yourself. He's dying on a cross.
[time=2409] Brutal, Roman cross. Brutal, he's suffering there.
[time=2416] Two things Jesus was put there for, number one, the sins of the world.
[time=2422] He was there for us, completely there to be the living, perfect, spotless sacrifice that a holy God demands for the wages of sin is death.
[time=2436] And without that death, either we have to take that or Jesus takes it for us.
[time=2441] And that is where we place our faith. We place our faith in Christ's death, his sacrifice on the cross for us.
[time=2449] The other thing, he was being completely and utterly obedient to the Father.
[time=2455] Every step of the way, this was God's plan.
[time=2460] Jesus chose to obey his Father, even death on a cross.
[time=2472] And so, with your piece of paper, take a few seconds, just write something on this, a sin, something maybe that trips you up regularly, something you need to confess today.
[time=2484] Just go ahead and write it on, take a few seconds, and then somebody will be around to collect those.
[time=2492] And on that cross, as you write, think of this, the wrath of God is being poured out on his Son for us, because that's the only way.
[time=2505] God couldn't just overlook sin, he'd be like, "That's fine, don't worry about it." A holy God could not just ignore sin, so he sent his Son, put him on the cross, poured out his wrath against all the evil and sin.
[time=2523] God made him who had no sin to be sinned for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
[time=2532] So, write it something on a piece of paper, and as the creators come forward, you can grab those, you can drop them in the box, and somebody will be putting them on the cross this morning.
[time=2545] And as you do that, you can pull out your candle as well, and you can just pop this little baby right through the center.
[time=2554] So, we're going to light these, we're going to be really careful, or people will yell at me.
[time=2560] So, if your candle is lit, it must remain upright, unlit goes to the flame.
[time=2567] It's kind of like a mosquito going to the bug zapper.
[time=2570] You're the mosquito, the light is the zapper, go right to that.
[time=2576] So, as you pass those in, somebody will come around to light your candle.
[time=2580] Take your time, there's no rush.
[time=2583] We're here to remember, and think about, and just pause, even if it's only an hour or whatever.
[time=2591] We're so busy.
[time=2593] When I get to lunch, got to be at Applebee's.
[time=2597] Got reservation, got ham and oven, it'll be okay.
[time=2602] Let's take your time.
[time=2607] Not only was Jesus who bore the sins of the world, but he is the true light of the world.
[time=2615] On the very cross, Jesus would be raised to draw all men to himself.
[time=2620] On that very cross, he would reveal the true God as lover and savior of the world.
[time=2630] This is what our God has done for us, the lengths at which he has gone, the pursuit that he has had of us.
[time=2637] He made a way for us, he didn't just leave us in our sin.
[time=2641] He sent his son to die, to take the sins upon himself.
[time=2651] One of my favorite songs that we sing sometimes with the high school kids is "Light of the World" who stepped down into darkness, opened her eyes, let us see.
[time=2661] Oh, that's all. She stepped down into darkness.
[time=2668] Just go ahead and reflect on the cross.
[time=2671] Just take your time.
[time=2673] Think about the sin you wrote down.
[time=2686] Think about the great lengths that Jesus has gone.
[time=2693] He came from heaven to earth, born through the Virgin Mary, lived a life of sinless devotion to the Father,
[time=2707] allowed himself to be arrested, to be tried, to be beaten, hung on a cross for us, and out of obedience to the Father.
[time=2737] From the sixth hour to the ninth hour, darkness came over all the land.
[time=2766] About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[time=2781] Some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling Elijah." Immediately one of them ran, he got a sponge, he filled with wine vinegar, put it on a stick and offered it to Jesus to drink.
[time=2794] The rest, I leave him alone, let's see if Elijah comes to save him.
[time=2804] And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.
[time=2813] Go ahead and blow out your candle.
[time=2843] At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn
[time=2872] in two from top to bottom.
[time=2875] The earth shook and the rocks split.
[time=2879] The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people had died but raised to life.
[time=2885] They came out of the tombs and after Jesus' resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.
[time=2891] When the Centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and all that had happened,
[time=2898] they were terrified and exclaimed, "Surely, surely he was the Son of God."
[time=2906] When Jesus died that day, many people who had followed him, they believed that he was the Messiah, the chosen one, the Son of God who would come and redeem the people.
[time=2919] They must have lost their home when he died that day because darkness came over all the land that day.
[time=2940] After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
[time=2950] There was a violent earthquake.
[time=2953] For an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb rolled back the stone and sat on it.
[time=2962] His appearance was like lightning and his clothes were white as snow.
[time=2967] The guards were so afraid of him, they shook and became like dead men.
[time=2974] The angel said to the woman, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
[time=2985] He's not here.
[time=2990] He has risen."
[time=2996] We stand and sing with us.
[time=3006] And the sing celebrate His death and rising.
[time=3013] Celebrate His death and rising.

[time=3284] Christ will come again.
[time=3289] One more time.
[time=3292] Christ has died and Christ is risen.
[time=3299] Christ will come again.
[time=3304] Amen, let's continue to sing together this morning
[time=3312] about our redeemer who conquered the grave and rose again.
[time=3317] Let's sing this out.
[time=3320] Our God will reign.
[time=3338] Our God will reign forever and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name and all the world will know His name
