[time=0] [THEME MUSIC]
[time=30] Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast this morning.
[time=37] It's great to have you with us.
[time=38] And what an amazing Easter celebration.
[time=42] Resurrection Sunday celebration we were able to have.
[time=45] I hope you were able to join us.
[time=47] I'm so thankful for the job that our team did.
[time=50] So thankful for the work that Corbin and our musicians and all of our artists put together.
[time=56] And so thankful for Jesse Hanna and the creative, powerful Resurrection Sunday message that he brought.
[time=63] It was a phenomenal experience from all the reports I received.
[time=68] And I want to just say thank you to our team.
[time=71] Our family, the bird family, had a great, great week away.
[time=75] Some of you know it was our oldest son's last spring break with the bird family.
[time=80] So we missed our first Easter in 10 years, but had a rich and meaningful time together as a family.
[time=87] And it's great to be back.
[time=88] And great to be back this morning in the book of Ephesians.
[time=92] And we start chapter 5.
[time=94] And I want to just say this.
[time=95] You'll see in the message this morning that we're going to make a big deal about chapter 5 of Ephesians.
[time=101] Every chapter has been a big deal.
[time=103] But I want you to know that I really feel like the content of chapter 5 might be the most applicable, most important, most relevant chapter we've come to in a long, long time around here at Black Hawk and on the broadcast.
[time=119] You see my friends, the issues that you and I face today in this culture along the lines of sexual immorality, sexual temptation, the way we respond to the sexual promiscuous message of our culture, the messages that we receive, not just daily, but by the hour when it comes to the world's view, culture's view of sex, marriage, and relationships, all of these things God speaks to in chapter 5 of Ephesians.
[time=151] And so we're going to take over these next five weeks a careful look at chapter 5.
[time=156] And there are going to be today in the message, you'll hear it, some very specific and I think very helpful invitations for you to really kind of increase your participation in this study.
[time=168] There's going to be some specific things that I'm going to ask you to do over these next five weeks as it relates to Ephesians chapter 5.
[time=176] And our five week look at the very real, very practical, very important things God says about how we as believers are to walk and live in the midst of a culture that is absolutely rampant with sexual deviation and temptation.
[time=193] How can we live sexually pure lives?
[time=196] How can marriages be all that God intended them to be?
[time=200] These are some questions that chapter 5 is going to give us some help with and I can't wait to get to it with you.
[time=205] Thank you for tuning in and thanks for caring as much as you do about the truth of God's word and the opportunity we have to apply it in the everyday of life.
[time=215] Hey, keep writing in on the email front.
[time=217] It's great to hear from you anytime.
[time=219] Thank you so much for being a part of this family.
[time=221] God bless you and we hope to see you soon.

[time=448] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 65 seconds]
[time=521] (upbeat music) - We're gonna sing that chorus one more time.
[time=527] Flip your voices to them and declare your intent for worship today.
[time=532] [MUSIC - 38 seconds]
[time=575] (upbeat music) - Well, hey, open your Bible as if you would to the book of Ephesians.
[time=581] We're gonna come back to our study in the book of Ephesians.
[time=584] We've been in it for quite a while.
[time=587] So encouraging to hear your responses to this study.
[time=591] I'm so thankful for what God is teaching you and showing us.
[time=595] And we come this morning to the end of chapter four, really the beginning of chapter five.
[time=600] And I wanna just do a quick review if I can so we can kind of catch you up if you weren't with us last time and then jump into some new material here in chapter five of Ephesians.
[time=610] The last time, first of all, I wanna just remind you of the title of the series, the truth, the way, and the life.
[time=617] And here's why I wanna remind you of this, the truth.
[time=620] You'll remember if you've been here at all over these last couple of months, the first three chapters of Ephesians teaches us the truth about our salvation.
[time=631] The next three chapters four, five, and six in a very practical, very helpful way helps us understand how we are to live out that salvation.
[time=642] And when you understand the truth about what God has done for you in salvation, when you understand better how to live that out, it leads to the life.
[time=653] And I wanna just say something this morning to all of you about the life.
[time=660] It is a good life.
[time=664] It is a life of fullness.
[time=666] It is a life of blessing.
[time=671] It is a life of peace.
[time=674] It isn't a life free of turmoil.
[time=677] No, Jesus said in John 16 in this world, you will have tribulation.
[time=681] This life is filled with trial, but in the midst of those trials, this life that God offers, those who fully surrender their hearts and lives to him, is a life that's really, really living.
[time=695] It's a life square, it said life sucks.
[time=700] And I thought about it.
[time=701] I thought, you know what?
[time=702] Coming from whatever vantage point you might be coming from, it may, but the truth of the matter is life doesn't.
[time=710] Life's hard, but when you really get down to it and you really understand the kind of life God offers you, it is a fantastic life.
[time=722] I want for all of you to better understand and know and realize what it means to really, really live.
[time=731] And that's why I'm so thankful for this study.
[time=734] Last time we were together in Ephesians two weeks ago, we had come to the end of chapter 4, and here at the end of chapter 4, we found Paul exhorting the Ephesians and all believers, then and now, them and every one of us along these lines.
[time=751] Look at 4.25.
[time=753] Here's where we left off.
[time=755] Therefore, Paul said to the church at Ephesus, and he says to the church here at Blackhawk, therefore laying aside falsehood, speak truth, each one of you with his neighbor.
[time=765] Tell the truth.
[time=766] For we are members of one another.
[time=768] Be angry and yet do not sin.
[time=770] Do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not give the devil an opportunity, which is what you do when you let the sun go down on your anger.
[time=779] He who steals must steal no longer, but rather must work, must labor, get a job performing with his own hands what is good so that he will have something to share with one who has need.
[time=790] Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment so that it will, the words you speak, give grace to those who hear.
[time=803] Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption, let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you along with all malice.
[time=818] Be kind to each other.
[time=821] Tender hearted, forgiving each other just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.
[time=828] So this is how he ends chapter four.
[time=833] Live like this.
[time=835] Don't do that.
[time=837] Fall in line here.
[time=838] He gives us a practical section there that just in every day terms lays out for us the way in which we should walk.
[time=846] And then he rolls right into chapter five.
[time=849] Look with me at chapter five verses one and two.
[time=852] It says there, therefore, in light of all I just said, in light of everything I just mentioned, church at Ephesus, church at Blackhawk, therefore be imitators of, say it.
[time=864] Say it.
[time=865] God.
[time=866] As beloved children, be imitators of God and walk every day living
[time=872] and walk in what?
[time=874] Say it.
[time=875] Love.
[time=876] Just as Christ also loved you and gave himself up for us and
[time=883] offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.
[time=889] Paul says, don't imitate the world.
[time=893] Don't imitate God.
[time=896] Don't live like the culture.
[time=899] Live in ways that are counter-cultural.
[time=902] Live in ways that honor and emulate God.
[time=906] End of chapter four.
[time=908] Don't speak lies.
[time=909] Don't be lazy.
[time=910] Don't speak inappropriately.
[time=912] Don't tear people down.
[time=914] Don't be mean.
[time=915] Don't be unforgiving.
[time=917] End of four.
[time=919] Beginning of five.
[time=920] Imitate God.
[time=926] Walk in love in a selfless, sacrificial way.
[time=933] Be imitators of God as beloved children and walk in love just as
[time=939] Christ also loved you and gave himself up for us.
[time=944] Now, I want you to watch carefully how this unfolds.
[time=949] And here's how I want to say this to you.
[time=952] If in that day, in that culture, a follower of Christ, a Christian,
[time=961] was going to imitate God and not culture.
[time=966] If a believer was going to be selflessly loving like Christ, Ephesians 5, 2, and not selfishly driven like those in that day, then because of the rampant debauchery and promiscuity of that culture.
[time=980] Because of the dominance of the illicit activity surrounding the Temple of Diana with its temple prostitutes and worship orgies.
[time=989] Because of the sensual, immoral climate that ruled not only an
[time=995] Ephesus but in the world at that time.
[time=997] If a believer was going to live a distinctively different life.
[time=1004] If a believer was going to imitate God, try to stay holy and set apart, have a good marriage, live in the light and not in the darkness.
[time=1017] Themes will come to as chapter 5 unfolds, then they were going to need serious and enormous encouragement and help when it came to dealing with the issue of sex.
[time=1032] And dealing with the issue of navigating sexual issues.
[time=1037] They were going to need serious help and instruction as far as facing the enemy and his onslaught of sexual temptation if they were going to live in any way, shape, or form sexually pure lives.
[time=1054] Now you see hanging behind me a bunch of fives.
[time=1060] And if it's your fifth birthday today, you're welcome to come up and take pictures afterwards.
[time=1066] We could kind of make that a special thing for you.
[time=1068] But here's the deal, here's the deal with the fives.
[time=1071] You know, I've been reading the book of Ephesians now for months.
[time=1075] I told you at the onset of our study that I would commit to just reading chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 just on an ongoing basis.
[time=1085] And I've been doing that.
[time=1087] And every time I come to chapter 5, in the midst of this world that you and I live in,
[time=1099] in the midst of this world that I live in,
[time=1106] every time I come to chapter 5, and I think about this world that our kids are growing up in, I think about this culture that our families are trying to navigate in and through.
[time=1119] And every time I come to chapter 5, in the last few months, it just feels as if something kind of wells up in me and I think it's the Spirit of God and I think what we're supposed to do and it's why we're doing it this morning.
[time=1134] I think I'm supposed to just say to you, "Hey, wait, we have really got to stop and take a look at what this says," kind of a special emphasis, little mini series within a series, if you will.
[time=1150] This is so important that on the topic of sexual activity
[time=1157] and sexual purity, the dangers of immoral living husbands and wives and how they really can live together and love each other and lead a home that's God honoring when it comes to God's design for marriage and family.
[time=1172] You see, these are the issues that today the enemy is having a heyday with.
[time=1177] He's destroying them left and right.
[time=1179] People don't understand or know how to face these challenges and temptations, they're succumbing.
[time=1185] The enemy wins.
[time=1187] The church weakens.
[time=1188] Families suffer.
[time=1189] Individuals live in darkness and not light.
[time=1193] It's horrible.
[time=1196] And so I want to just, we want to do our best in these next several weeks to look at this chapter in a way that would be not only encouraging to our family but meaningful to you.
[time=1209] And so here's what I want to do, I want to ask you to do four things.
[time=1212] And I don't know, maybe you don't write stuff down in service, but if you get a pen out and write these things down, it'd mean a lot to me.
[time=1219] I'd like to ask you to do four things as we move forward in chapter five.
[time=1223] I'd like you to make a commitment.
[time=1225] And if you're old enough to read, you're old enough to make this commitment.
[time=1229] Would you read chapter five, five times a week?
[time=1235] It's not really that long of a read.
[time=1238] And if you would make a commitment to read chapter five, five times a week, you pick the time, you pick the place.
[time=1245] If you want to read it 10 times you can, but would you read it at a minimum of five times between now and next Sunday?
[time=1253] And would you do that for these next four to five weeks?
[time=1256] You may want to do that alone, you may want to do that with your spouse, you may want to do it on your own, and then with your family, you may want to do it as a small group, you may want to incorporate that into your ABF.
[time=1265] However you do it, I'm asking you as an individual to make a commitment to read chapter five, five times a week in the weeks to come.
[time=1274] Secondly, would you pray about something that God puts on your heart early in these five weeks?
[time=1282] Maybe it's this morning, maybe it's next week, but would you be open to God putting something on your heart that you need to deal with, that you need to understand better, that you need to make right, that you need to, something that He would put on your heart?
[time=1298] Would you make a commitment today to pray about something, that God puts on your heart early in this little mini-series, and would you pray about that five times a week?
[time=1309] Maybe incorporate that time of prayer into those times of reading
[time=1315] and see what God does, those may be prayers of confession, those may be prayers seeking greater understanding, those may be prayers about a family member, those may be prayers about a situation that you know is unfolding behind the scenes that God needs to desperately speak into.
[time=1334] Thirdly, would you invite five people who might be encouraged by God's design for sex, purity, and marriage?
[time=1344] Would you think about the people in your workplace?
[time=1346] Would you think about the folks that you live near?
[time=1348] Would you think about the friendships that you have, folks who maybe could really use an infusion of what you know to be life-changing, eternity-altering truth, as we do our best to humbly look at God's design for sex, purity, and marriage?
[time=1366] And then fourthly, would you pray for me?
[time=1369] I don't ask that a lot of you directly like this, but I know in my own heart and soul, I sense a need to do the best job that I can to communicate these things in a way that makes sense in a way that would be helpful.
[time=1384] I want to do my best to stay out of the way and allow God's word to speak.
[time=1387] Would you pray for me five times a week over these next four to five weeks?
[time=1393] And if you would be willing to make these commitments, I believe God's going to do something really special and unique in your life and mind and in the life of this family.
[time=1402] Amen?
[time=1403] All that to say, my friends, you don't need me to stand here and tell you that when it comes to purity, that when it comes to navigating the waters of the myriad of sexual and immoral issues that you and I face each and every day, we are really up against it.
[time=1426] It is everywhere, and it is not going away.
[time=1429] It's getting worse.
[time=1431] And I just want you to watch this.
[time=1433] It's a music is a little edgy.
[time=1437] The things that you're going to read are discouraging and disappointing to some degree.
[time=1443] But I think it really does in a very realistic way set the stage for what we're about to see here in verses three, four, and five.
[time=1451] So watch this, listen, and take a look.
[time=1463] [MUSIC - 156 seconds]
[time=1621] In that same study that the Barna group did, it was a rather wide sampling of unbelievers who participated in it.
[time=1634] And of that sampling of unbelievers, I think at the end of the day, they said with regard to their believing, with regard to their believing friends, as they watched and noticed their believing friends live their life in this sample that Barna did.
[time=1651] One out of eight said that they noticed something distinctively different.
[time=1658] One out of eight.
[time=1662] And so you see statistics like that, and we're going to come back to some of those in just a moment, but let me just draw your attention now to what the Word of God has to say to us this morning.
[time=1673] As we deal with this, it says in Ephesians 5-3, "But immorality or any impurity or greed
[time=1686] must not even be named among you as his proper among saints."
[time=1695] I think in some translations in the NIV, I know it says that there's not to be even a what, a hint, not to be even a hint of those three things.
[time=1708] And those are the three things he chooses to use here in this text, immorality, impurity, or greed.
[time=1718] Not even a hint, not even a sniff, not even a trace.
[time=1726] Because this is not proper, he says, among saints,
[time=1732] saints, called out ones, those who have been by God, when you bow the knee of your heart and surrendered yourself to him, he calls you and die out from all of this.
[time=1743] We're to live in the world, but not of the world, and in our living in, we're to live distinctively different.
[time=1749] That's called a saint.
[time=1753] There must be no filthiness in silly talk or coarse-gesting, which are not fitting.
[time=1759] It's not proper, it's not fitting, but rather the giving of thanks.
[time=1764] For this you know with certainty, there may be some things we're uncertain about.
[time=1769] Here's something that we know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous or greedy man,
[time=1778] who is an idolater has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
[time=1786] Somebody whose life is marked by someone whose life is characterized by,
[time=1792] someone whose life exhibits ongoing and progressively deepening patterns of immorality and impurity and greed.
[time=1800] They have no place, God's word says, in the kingdom of God.
[time=1807] That person is, by virtue of what the text will teach us, an idolater.
[time=1815] That person doesn't worship God, that person is worshiping other things.
[time=1824] Now I want to take you back to some of those stats.
[time=1826] I know they kind of went quick on the video, but there's a few I want to just point out to you.
[time=1831] And we'll just kind of make our way through these, tried to kind of be sensitive to the audience this morning as well.
[time=1837] In the sex traffic industry, an estimated two million women and children are trafficked across national borders each year.
[time=1846] We'll keep going here.
[time=1848] 77% of those trafficked in that industry are under the age of 13.
[time=1857] Majority of American victims of commercial sexual exploitation tend to be runaway or thrown away youth who become victims of prostitution at the age of 11 and 12.
[time=1869] Keith raised back there in that last paragraph.
[time=1872] You understand that there are some kids today who are runaways?
[time=1882] There are kids who just get disowned.
[time=1885] There are 11 and 12 and 13-year-olds who just get kicked out who just get told to leave.
[time=1893] And that many of them end up.
[time=1896] Oftentimes, in situations like that, we'll keep going.
[time=1900] Approximately 24% of all U.S. pregnancies end in abortion.
[time=1904] In Russia, more abortions than live births, 13 abortions for every 10 live births.
[time=1914] Hollywood currently releases 11,000.
[time=1918] 11,000 adult movies per year.
[time=1922] There was one quote I read on that.
[time=1925] That that industry in the state of California, that industry pays 36 million dollars in taxes and employs hundreds of thousands of individuals.
[time=1938] 40% of young girls in the U.S. will get pregnant before the age of 20.
[time=1945] That's just staggering.
[time=1948] True, sad, but that's how that goes today.
[time=1953] One out of every six American women are going to face that in their lifetime.
[time=1959] 47% of families said that pornography is a problem in their home.
[time=1966] The U.S. Customs Service estimates there are more than 100,000 active websites,
[time=1973] illegal websites.
[time=1975] Look at that one, 55%.
[time=1977] It's the percentage of porn movie rentals versus non.
[time=1983] 44% of U.S. workers with an internet connection admitted to accessing an X-rated website at work in the last month.
[time=1992] One of three visitors to those websites will be women.
[time=1997] 70% of Christians, this according to Barna, admitted to struggling with porn in their daily lives.
[time=2004] 60% of pastors say that addiction to pornography is the most sexually damaging issue
[time=2010] to their congregation, and as a pastor I would raise my hand on that one and say I've experienced that to be true.
[time=2018] Yearly worldwide industry sales are reported to be $97 million to put that
[time=2025] perspective Microsoft who sells the operating system used on most of the computers in the world reported sales of $44.8 billion.
[time=2035] As of three years ago, at $13.3 billion the revenues of the sex and
[time=2041] porn industry in the U.S. were bigger than the NFL, NBA, and Major League Baseball combined.
[time=2050] Number one, search term, searched more than games, travel music,
[time=2058] jokes, cars, weather, health, and jobs combined.
[time=2065] So I show you all of that to say this.
[time=2074] I show you all of that to communicate this.
[time=2079] So as we live, the Scriptures teach us today, as we live in that world,
[time=2091] and that's Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's New York City, New York, it's Los Angeles, California, it's wherever you are in this world of ours.
[time=2102] So as you live in that world,
[time=2108] there is to be in your life not even a hint, not even a trace, not even a sniff.
[time=2124] Must not even be named among you in the NASB of immorality, impurity, or greed.
[time=2135] It's a very interesting phrase in the original language you know me.
[time=2139] I only talk to you about the original language when I feel like the original language will be helpful.
[time=2145] And here, literally, this idea of not even a hint, not even a trace, we can kind of laugh about the picture, the illustration, if you will.
[time=2154] I know this isn't a funny topic, but the picture really is of a hound dog.
[time=2160] And you've seen the movies, we all watch where the red fern grows.
[time=2165] It's the picture of a hound dog trying to pick up a scent.
[time=2170] And you can just picture a hound dog with the flappy ears just running around to each of you and me,
[time=2177] a dog coming up to you trying to get a scent.
[time=2182] And what the text is saying is that there's no scent.
[time=2186] It's the picture of a frustrated hound dog who can't get a scent to take him anywhere because there is no scent.
[time=2196] There's nothing.
[time=2198] There's nothing about you.
[time=2200] There's nothing going on in your life hidden or out in the open.
[time=2204] There's nothing happening. There are no patterns of this.
[time=2209] There's not a trace. There's not a sniff. There's not a hint.
[time=2216] And it is that not a trace, not a hint, not a sniff that allows you to live like a saint, a called out one.
[time=2229] Who's different? Different.
[time=2234] Set apart.
[time=2237] Uncommon in what is quickly becoming more and more common.
[time=2245] I don't know if I mentioned to you. I think I did. Yes, I did.
[time=2248] The birds were in New York City over the last several days.
[time=2252] And while we missed you on Easter, we had the privilege of visiting and taking part in the Resurrection Sunday Services at Redeemer Presbyterian Church in Upper Manhattan, a church of about
[time=2264] 6,000 people, pastored over three campuses by a guy named Tim Keller, who was an amazing author and writer and
[time=2271] speaker and a really good pastor as well.
[time=2275] It was an amazing experience for Cabernet and the kids.
[time=2279] We taxied from Times Square where we were staying up to the church.
[time=2285] It's about 20 blocks away or so.
[time=2288] That was one of the first interesting experiences of our trip.
[time=2291] We realized seven birds wouldn't fit in a taxi.
[time=2295] So we had to split up, which was quite disturbing for a few of our folks, but we got through it.
[time=2303] And we got to experience an amazing, amazing Resurrection Sunday worship service there at Redeemer Press.
[time=2310] Following that, we got to walk 10 blocks the other way and catch a subway, which was really fun.
[time=2318] And we caught the subway to go about 30 blocks down to lower the lower east side to meet up with some
[time=2324] friends of ours, Tim and Karen Beck from Blackhawk.
[time=2327] We're in New York City for the weekend.
[time=2329] A couple of their kids live there in New York City.
[time=2333] One is married and has kids, and so the whole Beck clan invited us to come and have lunch with them.
[time=2338] So we did, we got there on the subway, we had a huge lunch, and then later that day we walked.
[time=2343] We walked around that part of town, and the lower east side was a great time.
[time=2349] It was fun to be outside as a beautiful day.
[time=2351] But the lower east side of Manhattan, while there are a lot of people there, it is the home of the Hasidic Jew.
[time=2358] There are Hasidic Jews all over the place there in the lower east side of Manhattan.
[time=2363] It's kind of their stronghold.
[time=2365] So as you would walk down the streets, in the midst of thousands of people, there you would see a block, two, three blocks away.
[time=2371] You can't miss them.
[time=2372] And most of my kids had never seen Hasidic Jew with the hat.
[time=2377] You know, the hat that was just right, and the black, and the vest, and the white shirt, and the shoes, and the hair that was long, and the sideburns that are braided and dangled down, halfway down,
[time=2388] their torsos, and the phylacteries hanging down over the bill of their hats.
[time=2393] I mean, they have all that stuff just dialed in perfectly, and you can't miss it, and you can see them a mile away.
[time=2400] And as we walked, we saw them everywhere we went.
[time=2403] Oh, look, there's a, you know, you could just boom, there they are.
[time=2409] And that's exactly what God's Word is saying to you and I this morning on the immoral, impure, greed front,
[time=2420] you should be living, and I should be living our lives in such a way that in the midst of thousands of people,
[time=2428] four blocks away, we just go boom, there's one.
[time=2432] Countercultural.
[time=2435] There wasn't anything about the Hasidic Jews I saw that said Abercrombie and Fitch.
[time=2441] There wasn't anything about them that said the gap.
[time=2447] There was no, there was no north face on their back left shoulder.
[time=2451] There was, and I'm not, I'm not knocking gap or any of that stuff.
[time=2454] I'm just telling you that they weren't like the rest of us.
[time=2461] And I know that's an external illustration I just gave.
[time=2465] And most of you I think understand that what God's looking for are hearts that are given to him at a deep level.
[time=2473] But when a heart is given to him at a deep level, what happens is we begin to make choices and we begin to move in
[time=2480] directions that are countercultural, we become uncommon and spot it easily in a world that's moving that direction.
[time=2488] Make sense? Amen?
[time=2490] This is what the text is, is teaching us.
[time=2495] Not even a hint, not even a trace, not even a sniff of what?
[time=2500] Well, look at what it says there.
[time=2502] But immorality, let's start there.
[time=2504] But immorality, the word is, and you can write this down, Pornea, P-O-R-N-E-A, Pornea.
[time=2510] You can just guess what words we've derived from the word Pornea into our English language.
[time=2519] But the word Pornea means illicit, immoral, sexual activity, illicit, sinful, immoral, sexual activity.
[time=2528] It's physically engaging in any sexual activity, any sexual involvement outside of God's design for sexual activity.
[time=2541] And usually, you know, anytime is a good time to just be reminded of what God's design is, right?
[time=2549] Good for us today to be reminded in this world of ours that God's design for sexual activity,
[time=2556] he designed it, he made it, he created it, he knows how good it is, he knows how right it is,
[time=2563] and in God's design, he designed it for a man and a woman who are married.
[time=2573] [AMEN] A man and a woman.
[time=2578] Not a woman and a woman, not a man and a man.
[time=2581] Not a man and a woman who aren't married, not a woman and a woman who are thinking about me.
[time=2585] No, he designed it for a man and a woman.
[time=2589] God created them, man and woman.
[time=2594] And he brings them together in a thing called marriage.
[time=2599] And in that context, he says, have fun.
[time=2606] Enjoy.
[time=2608] Populate the Earth or however he said that.
[time=2610] Be fruitful.
[time=2614] Pornea is when that's violated.
[time=2618] When there is illicit, sinful sexual activity outside of that design that God gave.
[time=2627] There's not to be a hint.
[time=2633] It shouldn't even be named among us, Paul says, because you're Christians.
[time=2639] You're saints.
[time=2640] You're called out ones.
[time=2642] And while everybody in the world, you're right, is doing it, he calls us to stand over here
[time=2650] with great integrity and with great struggle at times, for sure.
[time=2654] But yet with great character and a commitment to honor God's design.
[time=2659] He says, but immorality or any impurity is the word he uses.
[time=2664] Acha, kind of a long one.
[time=2666] I know some of you like writing these words down.
[time=2668] Aca Tharsia, T-H-A-R-S-I-A, sexual looseness, lustful indulgences.
[time=2681] Whereas Pornea meant actually physically engaging in immorality with another, Aca Tharsia meant
[time=2689] being around it, willingly being around it, planning to be around it.
[time=2696] Aca Tharsia meant supporting it.
[time=2699] Aca Tharsia meant being caught up in it privately.
[time=2702] It meant watching it, clicking on it, reading about it, listening to songs about it.
[time=2715] Then let me just remind you.
[time=2717] Let me remind you 15-year-olds.
[time=2728] Rarely, rarely ever does someone go completely just over the cliff.
[time=2740] Rarely does somebody start right at the edge of Pornea.
[time=2745] No, no, no, usually.
[time=2747] Most oftentimes it begins with Aca Tharsia.
[time=2752] Usually it begins with thinking about it.
[time=2755] Usually it begins with being around it.
[time=2758] Usually it begins with listening to it.
[time=2761] Usually it begins with clicking on it and it's the clicking and it's the listening and it's the being around it and it's the thinking about it that leads to it.
[time=2773] With someone else outside the design that God's given which leads to the busted, ruined,
[time=2783] horrible heartache of immorality.
[time=2791] Let me just say this real quick to anybody or everybody in the room.
[time=2797] Again, if you know me and if you know this place, you know the heart with which we say this.
[time=2802] This is not a chance for me to stand up and slap you on the wrist.
[time=2808] This is not a shame on you.
[time=2811] See, because I know, I know all of you.
[time=2814] I mean, I know most of you, but those I don't know, I know because you're in the same boat that I am, you're human.
[time=2822] And these are hard battles to fight.
[time=2824] I know.
[time=2825] I know mistakes get made.
[time=2827] I know patterns get developed.
[time=2830] And so while there are maybe a few in here saying, wow, thank God that, you know,
[time=2836] I've been spared from these things.
[time=2838] I know that there are many, many in this room this morning and others listing online.
[time=2845] Just sitting there with a sense of brokenness in your heart because you know that this is you.
[time=2852] And if you know me and if you know us, you know that while we're willing to communicate what God's word says,
[time=2858] we're also very happy to communicate the rest of what God's word says.
[time=2862] And that is that there is hope and that there is healing and that there is forgiveness.
[time=2868] And there is a way that you can walk from that place of brokenness to a place of healing and wholeness.
[time=2878] But God's word says there isn't to be a trace of Pornea or Acatharsia in your life.
[time=2887] Thirdly, he says, but immorality or any impurity or greed.
[time=2893] Interesting, isn't it?
[time=2895] To many of you.
[time=2897] I mean, I've seen this for years and I understand the connection.
[time=2900] Many of you think, wow, greed.
[time=2903] I mean, I understand immorality.
[time=2905] I understand sexual impurity.
[time=2907] But now he's going to start talking about me and my love for money.
[time=2912] Yeah, it's really, really evil.
[time=2918] It's really not good.
[time=2920] It is so far from the picture that God wants you and I in our lives to paint of what we're about.
[time=2928] Play-o-nexia.
[time=2929] You can write it down.
[time=2930] Greed.
[time=2931] P-L-E-O.
[time=2933] Play-o-nexia.
[time=2935] N-E-X-I-A.
[time=2938] There's not to be a hint of greed.
[time=2941] This word, play-o-nexia, is a ruthless preoccupation with material possessions.
[time=2947] And the word ruthless there is important.
[time=2949] It means not only a preoccupation with it, but it means you're ruthless about it.
[time=2953] It means you'll stop it.
[time=2954] Nothing.
[time=2955] It means that you can't be satisfied.
[time=2957] It means that you'll go to whatever degree you've got to go to.
[time=2960] You are so committed to having more.
[time=2964] A ruthless preoccupation with material possessions and financial gain and pleasure.
[time=2970] Always wanting more than you need.
[time=2974] It's making what you own, how much you have, all that you can purchase your priority.
[time=2981] It's making what you own.
[time=2983] It's making what you have, all that you can purchase.
[time=2986] It's making these things your priority.
[time=2989] Greed is about money, yes.
[time=2993] But more specifically, it's about your selfish, unending pursuit of more.
[time=2999] And he says to the believers in Ephesus, and he says to you and I this morning, there isn't
[time=3006] to be a hint of these things in our lives.
[time=3010] And look at verse 4.
[time=3012] I'll ask Corbin and Tonya to make their way up.
[time=3014] Would you listen as I read to you verse 4, and there must be no filthiness and silly talk
[time=3021] or course-gesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.
[time=3028] It's as if Paul is saying, oh yeah, by the way, don't even allude to these three things I just told you about, immorality, impurity, greed.
[time=3036] He says, oh by the way, don't even allude to talk about or even joke about any of the above.
[time=3044] It's not funny.
[time=3047] He says, it's not fitting for a saint, a called out, distinctively different one.
[time=3055] Remember this, this morning church, remember this, tuck this away to talk about it.
[time=3060] To give words to it is to think about it, and speech gives action to thoughts.
[time=3072] And so he says, don't even think about it.
[time=3076] Much less speak about it.
[time=3078] You want to think about something, go to Philippians.
[time=3082] Go one book over real quick, go to Philippians 4.
[time=3084] You want to think about something.
[time=3086] You want to move your mind and your body.
[time=3090] You want to move your decisions and your actions away from what we're seeing this morning.
[time=3097] Then it's so important that you think about what's right.
[time=3100] Look at Philippians 4.8.
[time=3102] Finally, brethren, he says, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right,
[time=3110] whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence,
[time=3116] and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.
[time=3123] Think about those things. Give thought to that stuff.
[time=3129] Talk about those things till the cows come home.
[time=3134] Because that's where you'll go, and that's who you'll be.
[time=3142] I want to just invite you to respond this morning.
[time=3144] I want to say a few more things, but I want to just invite you to sing this little chorus with Corbin and Tanya here.
[time=3151] My friends, this is so important.
[time=3154] I've been asking God for weeks that you would as a family respond and that you would read and pray and invite and lift me up in the process.
[time=3164] I think there's things God wants to do in your heart and mind, in our family, in this day.
[time=3170] And so let's sing this chorus if you would, sing it from your heart.
[time=3175] I'm going to come back up in just a moment.
[time=3179] Give us clean hands.
[time=3182] Give us pure hearts.
[time=3185] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=3192] Give us clean hands.
[time=3195] Give us pure hearts.
[time=3198] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=3204] Oh, God, let us be the generation that seeks to seek your face.
[time=3214] Oh, God, oh, chamber.
[time=3217] Oh, God, let us be the generation that seeks to seek your face.
[time=3226] Oh, God, oh, chamber.
[time=3234] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=3270] I hear the Savior say, "Thy strength indeed is small."
[time=3279] Tell the weakness what's in pain.
[time=3284] Finding me that all they know, Jesus stated all.
[time=3294] All to you I know.
[time=3299] Sin had left a crimson stain, King washed it right of stone.
[time=3315] Jesus made it all.
[time=3320] All to Him I own.
[time=3324] My sin had left a crimson stain, King washed it right of stone.
[time=3336] Let's remind ourselves this morning, the one who pays our nets.
[time=3344] Oh, praise the one who who paid my debt.
[time=3404] [AMEN] Wow, would you bow your heads with me?
[time=3407] You can still make your way down.
[time=3409] We'd love to just talk with you and pray with you.
[time=3411] We've got folks down here that can do that and would love to connect with you and encourage you in any way possible.
[time=3417] Father, God, we're grateful for the morning.
[time=3420] Thankful, most of all, for the great power of your word.
[time=3423] These aren't words that we've contrived.
[time=3426] This isn't a message that we've come up with.
[time=3428] This is the holy set-apart word of God that has strength and power in our lives.
[time=3436] And God, we're thankful, thankful for your spirit that lives in us and makes these words
[time=3442] and these truths come to life.
[time=3444] God, thankful for the people of God who can sit and pews at the front of a church and pray
[time=3450] with each other.
[time=3451] God, we can live with each other as the wheat progresses.
[time=3454] We can stand alongside and offer grace and hope and help.
[time=3460] Oh, God, I pray that we as a family would do these things in the days to come.
[time=3465] Give us courage to commit to our readings and our prayers, our invitations.
[time=3472] God will look forward to being together again soon and all the people in the room agreed and said amen.
[time=3479] God bless you.
[time=3480] Give us clean hands.
[time=3483] Give us pure hearts.
[time=3487] This not lift our souls to another.
[time=3493] Give us clean hands.
[time=3496] And give us pure hearts.
[time=3500] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=3506] Give us clean hands.
[time=3510] Give us pure hearts.
[time=3514] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=3520] Give us clean hands.
[time=3523] Give us pure hearts.
[time=3527] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=3533] God, let us be the generation.
