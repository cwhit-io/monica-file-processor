[time=120] [MUSIC - 136 seconds]
[time=264] [APPLAUSE]
[time=268] - Dress up. It was my favorite thing to do when I was a kid.
[time=273] I would go to my mom's closet and take out everything.
[time=277] And I do mean everything.
[time=280] The entire contents of her closet all over the floor.
[time=285] Now that I'm a mom, I know she must have just wanted to scream when she saw this mess, but she never did.
[time=293] She has always been a very patient woman.
[time=296] I could learn a lot from that.
[time=299] But I would put on her shoes and her best jewelry and I would wear that tiara.
[time=306] Come to think of it, I don't think I ever saw her wear this thing.
[time=311] She must have just kept it in there for me.
[time=314] But I would put it all on and I would feel just like a princess.
[time=319] I was still into playing dress up when my family started to attend church.
[time=324] We always sat in that same section.
[time=327] I remember because I used to trace the number and the letter with my finger whenever I got to sit on the end.
[time=333] It was the perfect spot, close enough, but not too close, near the exit, just in case my mom was running later, my dad wanted to slip out a little early.
[time=344] Section four, row D.
[time=349] I grew up in church and I came to faith in Christ at a very early age.
[time=354] There was no need to come as a little child.
[time=358] I was a little child.
[time=360] I just believed it was simple.
[time=363] There was no, just as I am moment, no great redemption from some terrible five-year-old addiction.
[time=373] I just came and believed.
[time=377] And so it's been like that for a while now.
[time=379] I just celebrated my 29th birthday for the third time.
[time=385] And I still found myself sitting in that same section.
[time=389] And I love church.
[time=391] I love being part of something bigger than just me.
[time=394] I love the singing.
[time=396] I even take notes.
[time=399] But something began to stir in my heart a couple months back.
[time=403] Just this realization that there has to be something more than just this, more than getting up every day and going to work and taking care of the kids
[time=413] and going to church and sitting in that same section every Sunday.
[time=418] It's like that moment in dress up when you look in the mirror and you realize you're not really a princess.
[time=428] It's just you in clothes that just don't fit.
[time=436] And just like that, I began to realize that I need my own faith in God
[time=442] that fits me like a glove.
[time=448] I heard a speaker say one time that we have as much of God as we want.
[time=451] If we want $5 worth of God, well, then you've got it.
[time=456] And I have had $5 worth of God for far too long.
[time=462] And I want more.
[time=467] I want my own prayer life, my own understanding of Scripture.
[time=473] And I need to serve God in a way that uses the gifts that He's given me.
[time=479] And I need real fellowship in my life.
[time=484] Relationships with other believers who know me, the real me, on my good days and my bad days, but more importantly than anything else.
[time=496] I need a deeper relationship with the God who knows me and loves me intimately.
[time=504] My Creator.
[time=507] And so today, Lord, I come.
[time=512] Not just believing that you are, but believing that you are a rewarder
[time=518] of those who diligently seek you.
[time=524] Just as I am without one plea, but that your blood was shed for me,
[time=542] and that you bid me come to thee, O Lamb of God, I come.
[time=560] (Applause)
[time=590] (Music)
[time=1151] He just keeps listening to it again and again and again and there's nothing wrong with that.
[time=1158] It's why I invited you to do it to take this truth and hide it in your heart and to be encouraged and to be even more and more aware of the truth that's here for us today in this world in this culture that God's placed us in.
[time=1180] I also invited you to pray. I asked you to pray five times a week about a specific issue in your life or in the life of one you know and love and as you read chapter five as we talk about chapter five as that issue comes to the surface and it may be different issues for different people, but I asked you to be willing to identify one specific issue that you would be courageous enough and committed enough to pray about five times during the week.
[time=1208] And if you want to do that five times a day, that's fine as well.
[time=1211] I asked you to think about just people in your life, good friends that you know, folks you live near, folks in your family, friendships that God's given you.
[time=1219] I just asked you to think about inviting five people to come in the weeks to come, invite those who could be encouraged by a family like this and the chance to hear what God has to say about these issues of sex and purity and marriage in a culture that's delivering
[time=1237] an antithetical message, an opposite message on sex, purity, and marriage.
[time=1245] Would there be some people in your life who would be encouraged by hearing what God has to say and then I asked you to pray for me.
[time=1251] I asked you to pray for wisdom. I asked you to pray for guidance.
[time=1255] I asked you that you would just pray for me and that God would help me say and communicate and teach these things in a way that would make a difference in our lives.
[time=1264] And so I want to encourage all of you to keep reading and praying and inviting.
[time=1270] God's going to do great, great things.
[time=1272] Would you, in honor of God's word, stand and let me read for you this morning Ephesians 5 verses 1 through 5.
[time=1280] It says there in Ephesians 5, 1, therefore be imitators of God, not of the culture, not of this world.
[time=1289] It says therefore be imitators of God as beloved children.
[time=1294] That's what children do. They copy and walk in love.
[time=1299] Just as Christ also loved you and gave himself up for us an offering and a sacrifice to God.
[time=1306] This is to be our posture, one of offering and sacrificing to God as a fragrant aroma imitating God.
[time=1315] What will this look like?
[time=1318] But immorality, verse 3, but immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you as is proper among saints.
[time=1328] And there must be no filthiness or silly talk or course jesting which are not fitting, but rather, instead of those things, a giving of thanks.
[time=1339] Interesting in the text, we didn't get to it last week, that word thanks there is the Greek word for grace.
[time=1346] So really it's not a giving of thanks.
[time=1350] God thank you, it's saying in the words that you speak, give grace.
[time=1358] Make sense? Be.
[time=1360] Anytime you're in immorality, any time you're in impurity, any time you're in greed, any time you talk about that stuff and it gets filthy and coarse and improper, you're always being ungracious.
[time=1375] So he says, don't do that, be giving thanks.
[time=1379] It's where we get that phrase, we set our grace.
[time=1383] Make sense?
[time=1385] It's amazing.
[time=1387] For this you know with certainty that know immoral or impure person or covetous or greedy man who is an idolater.
[time=1398] People who have set up these things as their God and their lives are characterized by the worship of those things, none of them it says here have an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
[time=1411] Would you bow your heads and allow me as your pastor and shepherd and friend and leader this morning to pray for you, it's a privilege that God has given me and I want to do that this morning.
[time=1424] If your head's bowed and your eyes closed, please hear this prayer.
[time=1428] Father in heaven, I pray for these friends of mine, I pray for this family.
[time=1433] I pray, God, this morning that you would give them humble hearts right now, that your spirit and your word would work in such a way that their hearts would be softened and humbled, prepared this morning, God, to hear the truth.
[time=1449] A truth that they desperately need to hear, a truth that they desperately need to understand and apply.
[time=1456] Oh God, please soften and humble their hearts.
[time=1459] God, would you also give them this morning as we make our way through this discussion, would you give them courage in their spirit to respond to the truth that their humble heart takes in?
[time=1474] God, would you give them a courageous spirit and a boldness to make decisions that may need to get made?
[time=1480] God, to move in new directions that may need to be followed.
[time=1484] Oh God, would you, with this family, with these dear friends of mine, would you bring people into their lives who will help them?
[time=1494] Would you bring individuals into the everyday of their lives who would encourage them in this area of sex and purity and marriage?
[time=1503] And oh God, would you remove people who won't?
[time=1509] Those who won't help, those who won't encourage.
[time=1513] God, would you give them a distance from that influence?
[time=1517] God, would you keep your arms around them? Would you teach us this morning the things that we need to know and all the people in the room agreed and said amen.
[time=1528] Thank you for letting me do that. You can be seated.
[time=1531] Ephesians 5-3 says that on this immoral, impure, greediness front, it says that there is to be in your life, not even a hint.
[time=1543] And you may be asking, you know what we talked about this last week?
[time=1546] What brings you back to this again this week, Kelly?
[time=1550] And I just want you to know, I felt compelled from the minute I walked off this platform last week that there was more to be said.
[time=1557] This is a fight, my friends, for our lives and our futures.
[time=1561] This is a fight for the lives and the futures of our kids.
[time=1565] This is a life, I think, a fight for the life and health of the church.
[time=1570] What's going on in our world, what's going on in our culture in these arenas is something that we must be aware of and not just so that we can shake our fingers at it
[time=1581] and say, oh my gosh, how bad it is, but so that we can, as the church, called and designed by God to respond to this, respond in ways that are healthy and right
[time=1592] to respond in ways that can bring glory to Him and help to our own lives.
[time=1598] I could have provided for you this morning a whole new list of statistics I shared many with you last week.
[time=1606] I don't have a whole new list, I just got a couple that I'll run by you when you think why is this so prevalent on your heart and mind today, Kelly?
[time=1614] Why all the energy and passion in the room to try and get our focus to understand and see how God wants us to respond?
[time=1622] Well, think about this, think about the fact that $3,075.63, $3,075.63 is spent on pornography every second.
[time=1641] Every second, there are 86,400 seconds in a 24-hour period.
[time=1648] Let me do the math for you, that's $265 million a day.
[time=1658] $265 million a day spent.
[time=1666] Not on a $2 mosquito net that could save a million kids and people from dying of malaria this year.
[time=1675] Not $265 million spent on the 24,000 kids who will die today from starvation.
[time=1686] But $265 million a day spent on that.
[time=1696] $28,258 people ranging in age from 12 to 69, that's what the survey said.
[time=1710] $28,258 people in that age range viewing pornography on the internet every second.
[time=1720] That's 2.4 billion people every day.
[time=1728] And that, my friends, is our world.
[time=1731] And nowhere in the scripture do we find some communal call to get out of it.
[time=1737] We're not supposed to go live in some valley somewhere, find some mountain so we can get away from it.
[time=1742] No, in fact, God's word says that we're to live smack dab in the middle of it.
[time=1750] And yet somehow, there isn't to be a sniff of it in your life or mine.
[time=1762] We talked about it last week, a frustrated hound dog trying to get a sniff around your feet and nudging around your ankles,
[time=1772] looking up at you and just looking at his master going, there's nothing there.
[time=1778] Not a hint of it in your life or mine.
[time=1782] And as I thought more on these things over the past week, as I read your letters and your emails, many of them,
[time=1789] I'm painfully honest and encouraging.
[time=1792] And I want to thank you for the courage with which many of you have evidenced as you've written in and proclaimed your love for God and your desire for help and encouragement.
[time=1802] As I read your letters and emails and as I came back again and again in my reading to the words of scripture, I was reminded as I read in the book of James of what it is, of what it is that energizes and feeds
[time=1817] and fuels our immorality, our impurity, and our relentless greed, our ruthless desire and pursuit of more stuff.
[time=1830] And it is this deadly, intimate enemy called lust.
[time=1837] And we find this passage in James, would you turn back there and read with me, James chapter 1 comes after the book of Hebrews.
[time=1847] After Hebrews you find James and in James chapter 1 verses 14 and 16 it says this.
[time=1857] It says but each one of us, it says each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.
[time=1869] First of all, I just want you to see that. It's not somebody else's lust.
[time=1874] Each one know is tempted when he is carried away by his own lust, this lust that comes from within you, this lust that comes from within me.
[time=1884] Then when, listen to the verbiage here, very important, then when lust has conceived, stop right there.
[time=1892] And again, I want to just say this to you in the spirit within which it was written, and I want to say it to you appropriately for the audience in our room this morning,
[time=1903] but I just want you to look at that and say to yourself what's there.
[time=1909] When lust, what did it say there? It says when lust has conceived, when you, and you do this, this is what we do.
[time=1922] We hook up with lust.
[time=1928] And when we get intimate with lust, you with me? Something is conceived.
[time=1938] And when you and I get intimate with lust, the Scriptures teaches that it gives birth to what? Say it to sin.
[time=1948] Sin is what is born out of the union of you and your lust, and when sin gets acted out, when sin gets accomplished, the text says it brings forth difficulty.
[time=1965] It brings forth hard times.
[time=1969] It brings forth challenging circumstances. Is that what the text says? No.
[time=1976] Wake up, O sleeper.
[time=1980] Arise from your death. Sin brings forth death all the time.
[time=1990] That's where it leads. Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.
[time=2001] Joshua Harris in his book, Not Even A Hint, I'd highly recommend it to anybody.
[time=2006] Any age, Joshua Harris, Not Even A Hint, he says in that book, because the lust possibilities are endless, I have a simple definition for lust craving sexually in this context here.
[time=2019] Craving sexually what God has forbidden.
[time=2022] To lust is to want what you don't have and weren't meant to have by virtue of God's design and his providence and your choices.
[time=2031] Lust goes beyond attraction and appreciation of beauty or even a healthy desire for sex.
[time=2037] It makes these desires more important than God.
[time=2042] Lust wants to go outside God's guidelines to find satisfaction. Lust wants to make him, small h, her or it your God.
[time=2054] I've come to believe that lust may be the defining struggle for this generation.
[time=2061] Writing two books on the topic of dating and courtship has helped me see just how serious this problem is for a broad spectrum of believers.
[time=2070] I've received thousands of letters and emails from people of all ages around the world who are struggling with sexual impurity.
[time=2078] The stories are heartbreaking and they're from both women and men.
[time=2082] They're stories of small compromises that led to serious sin and regret.
[time=2087] They're stories of secret and anguishing battles with premarital sex, with pornography and with homosexuality.
[time=2094] They're stories from those who once swore to remain pure and now can't believe the depths of impurity to which they've descended.
[time=2104] Chelsea, a girl who found herself trapped in a web of self-satisfaction and internet pornography, wrote me her letter is typical of the desperation and frustration of so many.
[time=2116] She writes, "I don't know who I am anymore. I am so scared.
[time=2122] I do what I know is wrong. I have tried to stop. Really, I have. I have cried and sobbed at night.
[time=2130] I have prayed and kept journals. I have read books. I am honestly at a loss.
[time=2136] I love God, but I cannot continue to ask for forgiveness over and over and over for the same thing.
[time=2146] I know I need help, but I don't know how to get it. I know that God has so much more planned for my life than this.
[time=2156] But this, this sin continues to conquer me, and she ends.
[time=2165] Can you relate to Chelsea's anguish? You try and try, but it never seems to be enough.
[time=2176] Is there anything more discouraging than losing the fight against lust?
[time=2182] It saps your spiritual passion. It makes your faith feel hollow.
[time=2186] It stifles prayer. It colors your whole view of your walk with God.
[time=2191] At moments you're so overwhelmed by shame that God seems a million miles away.
[time=2199] Did Jesus die to win this anguish for Chelsea?
[time=2208] Is this how it's supposed to be? Answer. What are you saying? No.
[time=2222] No, it's not. Not at all.
[time=2228] God doesn't want you to live. He didn't design redemptive living to be lived in an endless cycle of defeat
[time=2237] and despair and guilt.
[time=2239] Chelsea is right. Our Heavenly Father does have so much more planned for us than a life dominated by shame.
[time=2249] So why don't we experience it? He asks, what are we doing wrong?
[time=2256] In his book, Harris points out that Ephesians 5 and other key passages give us some much needed help.
[time=2264] And I want to share this with you this morning. What are we doing wrong in the battle against lust?
[time=2269] What are we doing wrong? Where are we missing the boat?
[time=2272] What is it that is absent from our approach to this battle and this fight against lust?
[time=2280] Let me just give you these three things. I think they're worth writing down.
[time=2283] I think they're worth remembering. I think these things would be worth talking to your friends about, talking to your kids about.
[time=2289] I think these would be things that we would want to talk about and look into and consider for days and weeks and months to come.
[time=2296] Why are we losing the battle against lust? Number one, we've had the wrong standard.
[time=2303] Number one, my friends, according to the Scriptures, I think we've had set out before us the wrong standard.
[time=2312] What I mean by that is the bar, the God-designed bar has been altered.
[time=2319] I've talked to my mom about this, and I know that my mom in high school, I know that me, when I was in high school,
[time=2330] I know that my kids who are in high school or going into high school this next year,
[time=2336] I know that for generations now, when high school kids who have a chance on a Wednesday night to have a Q&A with their high school
[time=2345] pastor about issues of sex always and have for 50 years to my knowledge been asking the very same question,
[time=2354] and usually it's the one that gets asked first, and most of you in the room know what it is.
[time=2360] How far can we go?
[time=2368] And please, just since we're all shooting straight here, let's just not pretend that high school kids are the only one asking that question.
[time=2379] Amen? That's a pretty weak amen. That was a convicted amen.
[time=2387] The question brings to light my point.
[time=2393] The question is how far can we go as if going anywhere down that road would somehow be God honoring?
[time=2407] And we really do. We have kids praying, "Oh God, show me how far can I go?"
[time=2416] And then beyond high school, you know, we grow up and we start wondering what movies we should watch,
[time=2423] and we wonder what magazines we should thumb through, and we begin to kind of set up for ourselves.
[time=2429] These kind of man-made benchmarks where I suppose this will be okay, but that wouldn't be, and you have yours and I have mine.
[time=2438] But what we've forgotten, oh, and then we start going down those roads, and some of us go further, and some of us don't go quite as far,
[time=2448] but nonetheless we start going down the road, and with the going down the road comes the struggle.
[time=2458] And we forget that the standard wasn't how far can we go, the standard was Hebrews 12-1.
[time=2467] Look at it real quick. Hebrews 12-1, therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us,
[time=2474] let us also lay aside, here you go, every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us.
[time=2487] Hebrews 12-1 reminds us of God's standard that as we walk down this road we're to set aside,
[time=2494] we're to lay aside not just those things which are sin, but even those things that lead to sin.
[time=2502] Let us throw aside every encumbrance, everything that might even smell like it,
[time=2508] everything that might even look like it, everything that might even taste like it, get it out, lay aside every encumbrance and the sin.
[time=2519] And Ephesians 5-3 says to a high school kid asking how far he can go with his girlfriend,
[time=2528] or that high school kid's dad wondering which websites he should click on, not even a hint,
[time=2542] not even a trace, not even a sniff.
[time=2549] Don't go down the road at all.
[time=2555] You say, whoa, wait a minute, 16, 17, 18-year-old, you're looking at me going like,
[time=2562] whoa, are you kidding like, if I, not at all, then I'm going to live like some goof.
[time=2568] I mean, they're going to like, look at me like, where are you from?
[time=2571] What do you mean you don't?
[time=2574] And I lovingly, lovingly say to you, welcome to life as a priest.
[time=2581] Welcome to life as a follower of Jesus Christ, a revolutionary, radical life that he calls us to in this world.
[time=2593] Moms and dads, you say, whoa, wait a minute, if I'm supposed to parent in a way that doesn't allow for even a hint,
[time=2601] then what's my 14-year-old going to say to me, how's my 16-year-old going to treat me?
[time=2608] That might be a little tough.
[time=2611] You might have some long nights, but hopefully you've also got a relationship, not just a bunch of rules,
[time=2619] but a relationship you've been building with him or her that allows you to navigate your way through those days,
[time=2627] of you helping them understand that the standard is nothing.
[time=2634] Zero, nada, how'd that translate?
[time=2640] Hey, Susie, are you listening?
[time=2642] Nada!
[time=2645] On the immorality, impurity, greed, front.
[time=2649] We've had the wrong standard, we've had the wrong source.
[time=2652] Write that down, we've had the wrong source.
[time=2656] What does Philippians 4, 13 say? Some of you know it, others of you just need to read it for the first time.
[time=2663] Philippians 4, 13, I think it might come up on the screen, Philippians 4, 13, I can do all things through who.
[time=2677] I can do all things through him, I can do all things through Christ who strengthens who.
[time=2685] Okay, so this is the problem.
[time=2688] For years and years and years, some of you in this room, and I'm with you on this in many respects.
[time=2694] For others of you, it's kind of a newer challenge, but for years, people in the church have been saying on these issues,
[time=2701] I am going to do this.
[time=2706] I am going to stop doing this, I will not do this anymore.
[time=2714] And then they even pray in a way that's a little, oh God, give me the strength so I won't do this.
[time=2723] And here's the deal, if the bar is at, not even a hint, who can do that?
[time=2732] Raise your hand.
[time=2741] Minor in my pocket.
[time=2745] Who can do?
[time=2746] Here's the point.
[time=2747] Who can do?
[time=2748] Not even a trace.
[time=2750] You?
[time=2751] I can't.
[time=2754] So take your eye won'ts and your eye can'ts and I'll never agains and get on your face.
[time=2764] Get on your knees and get on your face or your knees three or four or five or six times a day.
[time=2771] Don't grieve the spirit, we already talked about that.
[time=2774] Begg for his presence and his activity in your heart and life and realize you are helpless.
[time=2782] And the only way you're going to turn your back on lust is by his grace with his help.
[time=2789] You'll turn your back, you have to make decisions, you have to put the computer in the garage
[time=2795] or throw it out your window.
[time=2798] You have to say goodbye to some friends who were supposedly friends.
[time=2803] You may have to stop certain engagements, you may have to cancel certain subscriptions,
[time=2809] you may have to go talk to some certain people.
[time=2813] But you won't do it unless it's through him who strengthens you.
[time=2821] And that's not playing with words there.
[time=2824] That's just the truth.
[time=2826] Thank God for Isaiah 40.
[time=2830] Isaiah 40, 29.
[time=2832] He gives strength to the weary.
[time=2834] Can I hear an amen?
[time=2836] And to him who lacks might, raise your hand if you lack might.
[time=2840] And he who lacks might, he increases power.
[time=2844] I love the beginning of 30.
[time=2846] And I know it says young, but we can all identify with it.
[time=2849] Though youths grow weary and tired, and there are many in this culture today.
[time=2854] Many youth who are growing weary and tired of this insatiable fight.
[time=2860] But there are many moms and dads of the youths who are growing weary as well as you and I struggle on these fronts in our own lives.
[time=2868] And though youths grow weary and tired and vigorous young men stumble badly, he gives strength.
[time=2876] And we mount up on wings like eagles, and we soar.
[time=2882] Not because of anything we did, but because we got on our knees,
[time=2888] literally and figuratively, and begged him constantly to fill us with the strength and might that only he provides.
[time=2897] We've had the wrong standard, we've had the wrong source.
[time=2900] This is so important that you get this third one, we've had the wrong motive.
[time=2904] That's right.
[time=2905] We've failed oftentimes in the battle against lust because we've come at it with the wrong motivation.
[time=2911] You see, we typically war and battle with lust in an effort to say no to pleasure.
[time=2919] Because we've just kind of bought into this thinking, and I understand why to a degree.
[time=2923] We've just bought into this thinking that pleasure's bad, God doesn't want us pleasured.
[time=2928] So we've learned to say no to pleasure, pleasure's bad, bad pleasure, stay away.
[time=2934] Like it's a bad dog or something.
[time=2937] When actually our motivation should be, our motivation in the battle against lust
[time=2945] should actually be unbelievable pleasure.
[time=2952] We should fight lust in an effort to experience pleasure.
[time=2959] Here's what I mean.
[time=2961] The scriptures teach us, my friends, that God designed us to experience pleasure.
[time=2968] And I'll be careful here, but I'll be forthright in these arenas.
[time=2974] Are you with me?
[time=2975] In the arena of sex, purity, and marriage, God designed us to experience over the top pleasure.
[time=2988] His design for a man and a woman.
[time=2993] He made us to experience that in his time and in his place and within his parameters.
[time=3002] So we should fight lust in order to experience pleasure.
[time=3006] John Piper says it so well in his book Future Grace.
[time=3010] We must, listen, we must fight fire with fire.
[time=3014] The fire of lust's pleasures must be fought with the fire of God's pleasures.
[time=3021] If we try to fight the fire of lust with prohibitions and I will not.
[time=3028] Even if we try to fight it with the terrible warnings of Jesus, we will fail.
[time=3034] We must fight it with God's massive promise of superior happiness.
[time=3042] We must swallow up the little flicker.
[time=3045] I love how he says that.
[time=3047] We must swallow up the little flicker of lust's pleasure in the all-encompassing flame of
[time=3054] his holy design for satisfaction.
[time=3062] Sometimes I think we do a disservice when we look at all the stuff going on and say, "Wow, this is really tough today for us and our kids." And wow, I mean they're facing so many things that are so inviting.
[time=3077] And Piper says, "You know what? Check yourself there." It's so what?
[time=3085] Inviting?
[time=3087] Really?
[time=3094] Wives.
[time=3097] Wives, choose your husband with all of his flaws, with all of his failure.
[time=3106] I'm speaking as one who has both.
[time=3110] Wives, choose your husband instead of some guy online.
[time=3117] Stop it with the guy online.
[time=3121] Stop it with the guy in Boise who can type things nice and cool and just don't do that.
[time=3132] It can be insurmountably better with your husband in God's design with God's help and
[time=3140] with the courage and strength that he can give you and the help that's available.
[time=3145] Choose your husband instead of some Yahoo on a keyboard somewhere who has nothing really
[time=3154] by virtue of that opportunity but the capacity to shatter your life.
[time=3164] Husbands, just a reminder, playing blocks with your three-year-old in the playroom instead
[time=3175] of lying and making up reasons to come home late so you can see her playing blocks with
[time=3182] your three-year-old is better, more pleasurable, more thrilling, more exciting.
[time=3191] It's better.
[time=3194] Enemy tells you it's not the truth of God's Word tells you it is.
[time=3200] Young men, young women, waiting, just waiting, physically sexually waiting to give yourself
[time=3210] to completely give yourself to one individual in marriage instead of 25 along the way in
[time=3223] the back seat of a car, some hotel room somewhere, under false pretenses and surrounded with
[time=3231] lies and deception.
[time=3234] One in God's design, instead of all that along the way, is insurmountably, unbelievably
[time=3243] more pleasurable than anything you're ever going to experience on that other side.
[time=3251] And it's important that you tell yourself the truth about these things.
[time=3256] It's also important, wives, husbands, kids, if you've failed at all the above so far,
[time=3266] it's also very important to realize that he is a God of forgiveness and grace who can restore you physically and spiritually to a place as if it never happened, thrown into
[time=3279] the deepest part of the sea as far as the east is from the west as forgiveness is thorough and deep and you get new beginnings.
[time=3289] For the third time, for the fourth time, Chelsea's letter, I can't keep asking for yes, you can.
[time=3295] You and I have to.
[time=3298] With all three of those things on the screen, I know it's late, we got to go.
[time=3301] I want you to look at the screen, I want you to look at those three points, wrong standard, wrong source, wrong motive.
[time=3306] That right there, my friends, is the mystery of his plan.
[time=3310] You will find his strength in your, what, weakness.
[time=3315] As you despair in yourself because you can't pull off, not a hint.
[time=3322] As you despair in yourself, you will find hope in who, him.
[time=3327] And as you turn your back on lust, it's why I prayed for you this morning that you would have courage.
[time=3334] As you turn your back on lust, you will discover that true pleasure is something only God can
[time=3341] give.
[time=3344] Ephesians 5.
[time=3348] As you stand this morning, go ahead and stand quietly if you will, let me read this to you.
[time=3353] Ephesians 5, 6, told you we'd get there.
[time=3360] Let no one, listen, let no one, and they will try, the enemy will try within the hour.
[time=3365] I promise to do this, let no one deceive you with empty words for because of these things.
[time=3374] This that we've talked about this morning, for because of these things, the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience, therefore do not be partakers with them.
[time=3384] For you were formally darkness, but now you are light.
[time=3390] In the Lord, walk as children of light trying to learn, which many of you are doing, and it just fires me up to see you in this process, trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.
[time=3401] Do not participate, not even a hint, in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead
[time=3408] even expose them for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them
[time=3415] in secret.
[time=3417] But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light for everything that becomes
[time=3423] visible is light for this reason.
[time=3425] It says, read with me from the screen, "Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ
[time=3434] will shine on you, awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."
[time=3444] Father, we stand this morning encouraged and convicted and challenged, and hopefully emboldened
[time=3454] and encouraged to go and be the people God You've called us to be.
[time=3458] Would You please give us the physical, emotional, spiritual strength we need to do that?
[time=3465] And may we be at people who are willing to morning, noon, and night, and any time in between be on our knees, literally, begging for Your help and Your strength for that which
[time=3476] we cannot do.
[time=3478] Today's Bible Hour is being underwritten by a family grateful for God gifting them with 43 years of marriage, as well as children and grandchildren.
[time=3487] It is their desire that He be honored and glorified in their lives.
