[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again, and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] My name's Kelly Burton.
[time=35] I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Black Hawk Ministries, and we have the privilege of bringing to you each and every week what has been known for years and years and years as the Bible hour.
[time=47] And you know, sometimes people say it sounds like kind of a kind of an old kind of stale title, but the fact of the matter is it's far from old or stale.
[time=56] The Bible God's word is what has been at the foundation of Black Hawk Ministries for over 35 years.
[time=64] And the Bible God's word is what brings hope and perspective to this world that we live in.
[time=71] For a follower of Christ, it is a source of strength.
[time=75] It is a source of guidance.
[time=77] It is a source of hope and direction, guidance and direction and hope that we need desperately in times like this.
[time=84] And so I've never been more proud or more thankful to be able to bring to you the Bible hour and the teaching that God gives us here at this church and the opportunity to minister to not only those inside these four walls, but thousands of people all over this region.
[time=102] So it's good to be with you again.
[time=104] Many of you know, 'cause you've been watching, that we find ourselves in the midst of a chapter of the Book of Ephesians.
[time=110] It's been a several month series in the Book of Ephesians, but we come now to chapter five where we've been for three weeks and some very pointed, very direct teaching on the issue of sexual immorality, sexual purity and this issue of greed.
[time=128] And many of you have been reading along with us at Black Hawk, we've made a commitment to read the fifth chapter of Ephesians five times a week.
[time=137] We've been praying about the things that we see.
[time=140] We've been inviting friends to come and join us for this special kind of series within a series and I'll tell you the feedback that we're getting, the response that we're hearing, the letters and emails and texts that are coming in, it really doesn't surprise me, but it's been sort of overwhelming to see the spirit of God moving in the hearts of people in our church and in our viewing audience.
[time=165] And I wanna just encourage you today, as you hear the message and as you think back to the last couple of weeks, if God is doing something in you, in this area of sexual immorality, impurity, greed, if he's helping you see some truth, maybe for the first time, if he's reminding you of some truth and bringing conviction and guiding you out of some of what's been going on in your life and those areas.
[time=191] If you're experiencing some freedom today that you haven't experienced in years and years, I just wanna say to you, first of all, how thankful I am.
[time=200] Secondly, I'd love for you to write us an email.
[time=203] My email's right here on the bottom of the screen.
[time=205] I'd love to share your story of what God has been doing in your life through this study of the first few verses of chapter five.
[time=213] Love to share that story with our team, with our family, your story could be an encouragement to many, many others as they fight and battle against the enemy and his temptations in the realm of immorality and impurity and greed.
[time=229] Hey, lastly, I wanna say this, if you're willing to kind of stand and fight, if you're willing to follow God's word and move in directions that would be against immorality and purity and greed, I wanna invite you on Friday nights at seven o'clock to come and join a community of people called Celebrate Recovery here at Black Hawk.
[time=250] They meet on Friday nights here in our choir room at the rear of our campus, their signs and people to guide you in.
[time=258] It is an amazing group of people of all ages, of all sizes, of all shapes, of all backgrounds with one common goal and that is a commitment to move away from the chains of addiction and sin.
[time=272] So think about that.
[time=273] You can learn more about Celebrate Recovery on our website and I'm so thankful to be in recovery myself from the sins that plagued me my whole adult life.
[time=283] So thankful for the encouragement and the accountability I receive from people who care about me and that process.
[time=291] They care about you as well, so come check it out.
[time=293] Thank you for tuning in today.
[time=295] I pray that as you open your Bibles to Ephesians 5, not only today, but in the days to come this week that your heart will be challenged and encouraged.
[time=304] We're thankful that you're a part of the family.
[time=306] God bless you and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=309] [MUSIC - 180 seconds]
[time=492] - Thank you, Corbin and team.
[time=501] Praise God for the privilege of worship, amen.
[time=506] What a powerful 35 minutes.
[time=510] And what a gift to hear you as a family lift up your voices thankful for the many of you that do that week after week from your heart and with great sincerity.
[time=521] And what a great privilege for us.
[time=523] Would you just right out of the gate this morning, can we just jump in and would you allow me the privilege of reading to you from the word of God?
[time=531] Would you stand in honor of that word and allow me to read for you from the chapter whose numbers you see on the wall?
[time=540] A few more of those numbers this morning.
[time=541] We as a family have made a commitment if you're joining us for the first time this morning or you've been away for a while.
[time=549] As a family at Blackhawk, we've made a commitment to read chapter five of Ephesians.
[time=554] Five times or more a week.
[time=555] We've made a commitment to pray.
[time=558] Five times or more a week as the spirit of God and the word of God reveals to us things in this all important chapter that we've needed to see and understand and maybe even apply more consistently in our lives.
[time=571] We've been inviting friends who we love and care for who may be encouraged as they hear in this chapter God's design for sexual purity and God honoring relationships and His design for marriage and the importance of moving away from things like greed.
[time=590] And I tell you, it's a chapter my friends that we as a church need to understand.
[time=595] These are truths that in this day, we need to not only understand but be aware of how it is God has asked us to navigate through these things in ways that honor Him and honor each other.
[time=607] And so it's been quite a challenge.
[time=609] The response has been overwhelming.
[time=610] I'm so grateful for your notes and your emails and your texts.
[time=614] Keep them coming.
[time=616] But let me read for you this morning.
[time=617] Ephesians five, one through 14.
[time=620] And I think, sorry, thanks Laura.
[time=625] Ephesians five, one to 14.
[time=630] Therefore be imitators of God.
[time=633] It says, "As beloved children and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us and offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.
[time=645] But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you as His proper among saints.
[time=655] And there must be no filthiness and silly talk or course jesting which are not fitting but rather the giving of thanks.
[time=663] For this you know with certainty that no immoral or impure person or covetous or greedy man who is an idolater,
[time=673] no one who worships these endeavors, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
[time=679] Let no one deceive you with empty words for because of these things, immorality, impurity and greed.
[time=689] For because of these things, the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
[time=695] Therefore do not be partakers with them.
[time=698] For you were formally darkness.
[time=702] But now having been redeemed, having been saved, now you are light in the Lord.
[time=708] Walk as children of light.
[time=711] For the fruit of the light consists in all-- look at this-- goodness, righteousness, and truth set in contrast to immorality, impurity, and greed.
[time=726] Be a people who are, verse 10, trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.
[time=731] Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them.
[time=738] For it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret, but all things become visible when they are exposed by the light.
[time=750] For everything that becomes visible is light.
[time=753] For this reason, it says, awake sleeper and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.
[time=761] Would you pray with me?
[time=764] Father God, we stand before you this morning grateful again to be in your presence thankful for the gift of your presence throughout our week.
[time=774] But in a special way, God thankful to be with the family of God.
[time=778] Here in the presence of God as we open up the word of God so that the spirit of God can do what only He can do.
[time=787] God, many in the room today come frustrated, many in the room come as they've read and wrestled with these truths.
[time=793] God is they've attempted to apply these things in their lives at maybe new levels.
[time=798] God, they've experienced failure, frustration, and they stand this morning.
[time=803] God fatigued by all that they've endured.
[time=807] And they need your touch this morning.
[time=810] They need more of your truth and more of your encouragement.
[time=813] God, they need you to be.
[time=815] We need you to be this morning, our source of hope, our strong tower, our refuge, and our rock.
[time=822] And we stand before you, God, of people who love you and are thankful for the grace that you have shown, God, for the commitment you've made to perfect us, to take what you've started and grow us into people who actually one day will look like your son.
[time=838] And our character in our integrity, God, we're a long way away from that.
[time=843] And we stand this morning in anticipation of what your word will teach us, give us comfort, challenge us appropriately, and we'll thank you for it all.
[time=854] And all the people agreed and said, amen, you can be seated.
[time=858] Well, we've seen again just in our reading this morning, my friends, that as it relates to sexual immorality, as it relates to impurity, as it relates to greed, verse 11 in the text that we just read referred to these things as the unfruitful deeds of darkness.
[time=876] I hope you see there and sense the analogy the writer makes to this issue of darkness.
[time=884] He mentions it a couple of times in the text there.
[time=886] These are the things that happen in the dark, aren't they?
[time=893] It's amazing how when you think about these things practically being lived out how many times these are the things that work so hard to avoid the light.
[time=905] And here he calls those things the unfruitful deeds of darkness.
[time=909] And we've seen in recent weeks that people whose lives are hard-heartedly-- listen, people whose lives are hard-heartedly characterized by these endeavors, these practices, people who readily and consistently worship these gods, the gods of sex, outside of God's design, impurity, and greed.
[time=930] These people, it says in verse 6-- and you can see it there in the text-- these people will experience what God's word says is the wrath of God.
[time=940] And I just don't want to go too quickly over that.
[time=949] I don't want to skim that.
[time=951] I don't want to downplay that.
[time=952] I don't want to beat anybody over the head with it.
[time=959] But I just want you to see it.
[time=962] That those whose lives are characterized by this, those who have not bowed the knee of their heart to him,
[time=973] capital H. And they've instead chosen to worship by virtue of the consistent pattern of their lives, these other endeavors.
[time=984] It says there in the text that the sons of disobedience, they will be visited by the wrath of God.
[time=996] And that, my friends, is God's judgment.
[time=1002] That is God's unrelenting eternal punishment.
[time=1006] The wrath unchecked, unabated, fully
[time=1017] unleashed wrath of God comes against those who, at the end of the day, have chosen to reject Christ.
[time=1026] And they have instead chosen to accept and give themselves in idolatry the worship of little G.
[time=1033] God, these areas of immorality, impurity, and greed.
[time=1042] And with that as a sobering backdrop, He comes to verse 15 and says, be what, careful.
[time=1055] There's just about five, six things here.
[time=1057] I just want you to write down quickly.
[time=1058] He comes to verse 15.
[time=1060] And with all of that as a backdrop, he says to you and I, he says to anybody who would be willing to listen.
[time=1067] Number one, he says, in light of all of that, please be careful.
[time=1075] Because there is so much at stake, he just got done talking about the wrath of God.
[time=1080] He talked about the unfruitful deeds of darkness.
[time=1087] He talked about the seriousness and the brevity of the situation.
[time=1091] And he says, right out of the gate, verse 15, therefore, be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise.
[time=1102] And I think you can just sense the importance of that.
[time=1107] I know there's not a parent in the room with a teenage son or daughter driving.
[time=1116] And I'm learning about this in recent days.
[time=1119] There's not a parent in the room with a teenage son or daughter driving who doesn't say, when that young man or that young lady grabs those keys and heads out to that car, there's not one of us that doesn't say, hey, be careful.
[time=1133] And it's not some little just piffy saying.
[time=1137] We're not just saying it to be cute.
[time=1138] We're not just saying it because that's what parents say.
[time=1141] No.
[time=1141] See, we understand what's at stake.
[time=1144] We know that more people die in car accidents than plain accidents.
[time=1149] We know that more people die in car accidents than about 25 or 30 of the leading diseases.
[time=1155] We know that cars are lethal weapons, that if not driven carefully, can kill or you can be killed.
[time=1164] And so we understand that every single time you get behind the wheel, it's time to be careful.
[time=1175] And Paul says, be careful if you think for a moment that immorality or impurity or greed won't kill you,
[time=1187] you're fooling yourself.
[time=1190] He says, oh, brethren, in the Church of Ephesus and in the Church of Fort Wayne and the Church here at Blackhawk, be very careful.
[time=1200] Be careful where you go.
[time=1203] Be careful what you watch.
[time=1205] Be careful what you click.
[time=1207] Be careful what you text.
[time=1209] Be careful who you're with, so much at stake.
[time=1217] Be careful.
[time=1218] He goes on.
[time=1219] He says in verse 16, I just love it.
[time=1221] He just starts going here 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
[time=1224] He says, be careful.
[time=1225] He says, make the most of your time.
[time=1229] As you're being careful, make the most of your time because the days are what, evil, left unguarded, left
[time=1239] or approached in an uncareful way.
[time=1242] Your days are evil.
[time=1245] Make the most of them.
[time=1247] Don't waste a single moment.
[time=1251] Don't waste a single day.
[time=1253] Look at your weak and don't waste any of it.
[time=1257] And in the context here, what's so clear is that when you engage in immorality and when you engage in impurity and when you are swallowed up in greed, you are wasting your time because none of it
[time=1276] is profitable.
[time=1277] Amen?
[time=1279] None of it.
[time=1280] Be careful.
[time=1280] Don't waste a minute.
[time=1288] And what will help you to be careful and not waste a minute is to know the will of God on this front.
[time=1298] Know what God's will is as you live out your faith in the midst of an immoral, impure, greedy world that is affecting you and I and trying to lead us every single moment of every single day.
[time=1312] Know what the will of God is.
[time=1314] It says it right there, making the most of your days because the days are evil, then he goes on in verse 17 and says, so then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
[time=1326] And the will of the Lord is quick review, not even a hint, not a trace, Ephesians 5-1,
[time=1342] not even a sniff of immorality and purity greed.
[time=1347] This is the Lord's will.
[time=1349] Go, if you would, just real quick.
[time=1351] Let me hear the pages turning.
[time=1353] Go over to 1 Thessalonians 4, would you?
[time=1356] Here we find in relationship to this very context
[time=1362] of sexual immorality and purity greed.
[time=1364] Here we find in 1 Thessalonians 4-3, here we find and see the will of God on this front for us.
[time=1373] It says right there, thank you for turning.
[time=1376] 1 Thessalonians 4, verse three, for it is, for this is the will of God.
[time=1385] Your sanctification, your spiritual growth, right?
[time=1389] This is the will of God, your sanctification.
[time=1391] That is that you would abstain from sexual immorality that each of you would know how to possess his own vessel
[time=1403] and that you would possess your own vessel in sanctification and honor, that you would control your body as it relates to these issues in ways that are honoring,
[time=1419] in ways that bring about sanctification, not regression.
[time=1425] This is the will of God, Paul says to the church at Thessalonica, that you possess your own vessel in sanctification and honor and that in this arena of immorality and purity and lust that you not handle your own vessel in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God.
[time=1445] What's God's will for you and I in this arena?
[time=1447] Verse six, that no man, 1 Thessalonians 4-6, that no man would transgress or defraud his brother in the matter because the Lord is the avenger in all these things, that no man would transgress.
[time=1463] We've talked about this before.
[time=1465] It's stepping over lines that God has drawn, transgressing, trespassing, stepping over into arenas.
[time=1473] He never designed you to live or walk in and defrauding in this arena, the physical arena,
[time=1482] taking things from another, physically taking things
[time=1488] for your own enjoyment that aren't yours to have.
[time=1491] Be careful.
[time=1499] Make the most of every minute on this front.
[time=1503] Don't waste time and what will help you is by knowing what the will of God is.
[time=1510] As you're thinking that through, he reminds him not to get drunk back to Ephesians 5.
[time=1515] He says, don't get drunk.
[time=1518] As you're making your way down this living out your faith in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, he says, don't be drunk with wine, verse 18, which is dissipation, but instead of being drunk, instead of being out of control, be under the control, be filled with the what?
[time=1536] Say it with the spirit, with the spirit of God.
[time=1543] I love what my notes say here in my study Bible.
[time=1547] Paul is not speaking of the Holy Spirit's indwelling or the baptism of the spirit, because every Christian is indwelt and baptized by the spirit at the point of salvation.
[time=1561] He is rather giving a command for believers to live.
[time=1564] Listen, continually under the influence of the spirit, how in the world, Kelly, can I do that?
[time=1572] How could I live continually under the influence of the spirit so I can be filled with the spirit and not drunk with whatever?
[time=1582] It says right here, I love this.
[time=1584] It says to be continually under the influence of the spirit by letting the word of God control you, pursuing pure lives, which is what we've been talking about, confessing all known sin, dying to self, surrendering to God's will, and depending solely on his power, not yours, in all things.
[time=1609] These are the very things we've been talking about in recent weeks.
[time=1612] Go back and listen or watch our messages over these last few weeks.
[time=1619] I would highly encourage you if you haven't.
[time=1621] I would highly encourage you to go to the website and download the Digging Deeper self-study.
[time=1628] The ongoing discussion of these messages in our Digging Deeper resource, the team has been putting out some of the best material I've ever seen them put out.
[time=1638] It's there to serve your needs.
[time=1640] It's a chance for you by about Wednesday to pick up an ongoing study of the message we had on Sunday.
[time=1645] You can use it in your own life.
[time=1646] You can use it with your small group.
[time=1648] Use it with your kids.
[time=1649] Use it with your family.
[time=1650] Use it with your class to be filled with the spirit.
[time=1658] It's the same as walking in the spirit.
[time=1660] Be careful, he says.
[time=1665] Make the most of every minute.
[time=1666] No God's will.
[time=1668] Don't get drunk with wine.
[time=1669] Be filled with the spirit.
[time=1673] Verse 20 says, be thankful.
[time=1676] You see it there in verse 20.
[time=1678] Always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1681] Someone asked me, why do you throw that in there?
[time=1686] Just all of a sudden, there's this be thankful.
[time=1690] This is just a general be thankful.
[time=1692] No, you know what's amazing about this be thankful is that it comes in the context at a point where I believe Paul is reminding you and me that in this context, in this discussion of immorality and purity and greed and the unfruitful deeds of darkness and the wrath of God that will come to those who practice these things, he reminds the redeemed.
[time=1715] He reminds those who have bowed their knees to Jesus Christ.
[time=1720] He reminds them, he says, aren't you glad that you don't have to go to those things to find life?
[time=1726] Aren't you glad that you don't have to give yourself to immorality to find love?
[time=1735] Aren't you thankful that you don't have to give yourself to greed to be satisfied?
[time=1740] Amen?
[time=1742] We don't have to live that way.
[time=1744] So be what?
[time=1749] Thankful.
[time=1750] Are you thankful?
[time=1754] You should be so very thankful.
[time=1757] And then he comes to verse 21, which is an extremely interesting, very small, very interesting,
[time=1764] extremely significant verse.
[time=1766] And let me just read it to you.
[time=1767] And then I want to tell you why it's so significant.
[time=1769] And be subject to one another and be
[time=1775] subject to one another in the fear or respect of Christ.
[time=1783] Now, in your Bible, if your Bible is one that has sections, mine is, most of our Bibles have sections, this got put in as the last verse in the section above 22,
[time=1797] which in your Bible and mine is most likely the first verse of a new section talking about husbands and wives.
[time=1805] Very unfortunate that it got divided like this, because really, as you come to 21, he introduces a new, very important thought for our discussion of husbands and wives, still very related in the broader context of living out our faves and our faiths in a crooked and perverse world, still very much in the context of how to navigate immorality, impurity, and greed.
[time=1834] But now he comes to this place where he says in verse 1, be subject to each other.
[time=1841] So I want to just, in your minds, I want you just to shift now.
[time=1844] We're about ready to talk about matrimony.
[time=1847] We're getting ready to talk about husbands and wives.
[time=1851] And usually, when we're studying Ephesians 5 and you want to come to the discussion of husbands and wives, you just, boom, starting on 22 wives.
[time=1860] Submit to your husbands as unto the Lord.
[time=1863] Well, before we get to 22, we really need to look at 21, because 21 says, hey, everybody,
[time=1874] submit to everybody.
[time=1879] Everybody be willing to live in submission and subordination
[time=1886] to others and be subject.
[time=1888] Paul states here in 21 that the Christian life is one of Hoopo Tasso.
[time=1893] I don't get into the Greek unless it's worth it this morning.
[time=1895] Again, it's worth it.
[time=1896] Get out your pins and follow along.
[time=1899] He says, be subject, Hoopo Tasso, Hoopo, is the preposition meaning under.
[time=1907] Tasso, which denotes a lining up of things or to place in order.
[time=1914] In classical Greek, Hoopo Tasso was a military term that described the lining up or marshaling, if you will, of troops under a single command and authority.
[time=1926] What really places our focus on this small singular verse is the way in which it was written.
[time=1932] This is so insightful, because Hoopo is a preposition.
[time=1936] There's four things here to see, that it's a preposition, it's a participle, it's in the middle voice in the Greek, and it's in the present tense.
[time=1943] Watch this.
[time=1945] Because Hoopo is a preposition, it declares that the reader should be the one doing the action.
[time=1952] You and I are to be submitting ourselves.
[time=1955] The word is also used as a participle, indicating that they are to be the subordinate ones.
[time=1961] The fact that it's written in the middle voice would declare that they themselves are to be the ones assuming the lesser role.
[time=1970] Finally, it is also written in the present tense, implying that they should continually be living in this way.
[time=1979] Ongoing, present tense, ongoing, continuous action, those Christ followers and Ephesus and each of us, as Christians today, should arrange ourselves under.
[time=1991] That's how I should view me in relationship to you.
[time=2001] Under, put ourselves in an inferior role.
[time=2007] This should be our willingness and our readiness.
[time=2011] In our language, we would use the term subordinate, or think in terms of submission.
[time=2016] And the text says, and be subject to one another.
[time=2022] Paul tells us early on here how to behave, be submissive, now he continues and puts this action into a relational context.
[time=2030] We are to submit.
[time=2032] We are to be subordinate to each other.
[time=2035] I am to be subordinate to you, and you are to be subordinate to me.
[time=2039] This should be the relational posture that we evidence.
[time=2046] The inference is that every person in the body of Christ is to take the initiative in assuming the inferior rank.
[time=2055] I love what my study notes say here on this topic.
[time=2059] It says, Paul declares unequivocally that every spirit-filled Christian is to be humble, submissive in their relationship with each other.
[time=2071] This is foundational to all the relationships in this section.
[time=2075] No believer is inherently superior to any other believer
[time=2081] in their standing before God.
[time=2083] They are equal in every way.
[time=2085] You go back just one book, a few pages to Galatians 3.
[time=2089] And it says in 326, for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
[time=2095] For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
[time=2100] There is neither Jew nor Greek.
[time=2103] There is neither slave nor free man.
[time=2105] There is neither male nor female.
[time=2109] For you are all one in Christ Jesus.
[time=2112] So this is the backdrop.
[time=2121] This is really the beginning of our discussion of husbands and wives.
[time=2126] And then he moves right into verse 22, having established that as our foundation.
[time=2131] And he says wives.
[time=2134] Now he gets specific.
[time=2137] And he says wives, be subject-- same word-- hupotaso.
[time=2143] Be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord.
[time=2155] Now let me read this to you.
[time=2158] I love just the insights I get on a regular basis just from these own-- my own study notes here in my Bible.
[time=2166] Having established the foundational principle of submission in verse 21, Paul applied it first to the wife.
[time=2175] The command is unqualified, applying to every Christian wife,
[time=2182] no matter what her own abilities, education, knowledge of Scripture, spiritual maturity, or any other qualifications might be in relation to those of her husband.
[time=2193] It's unqualified.
[time=2195] It's unconditional.
[time=2197] This is God's design.
[time=2199] He calls wives to hupotaso to submit themselves to their own husbands as to the Lord.
[time=2207] It's very important there.
[time=2208] That last phrase will come back to that.
[time=2212] Listen, men.
[time=2214] Listen, husbands.
[time=2216] The submission is not the husbands to command, but it is for the wife to willingly offer.
[time=2224] Any husbands in the room commanding this of your wife, you are outside of God's parameter.
[time=2231] You're outside of God's design.
[time=2232] It's not at all how he designed this to work.
[time=2237] Biblical submission on the part of a wife is willingly, humbly offered, not commanded or demanded
[time=2246] by a husband.
[time=2249] Your own husbands, very insightful wives, be subject to your own husbands.
[time=2258] This limits her submission to the one man God has placed in her life as her husband and also gives a balancing emphasis that he is hers as a personal, intimate possession.
[time=2276] Be subject to your own husband.
[time=2280] He is yours.
[time=2283] And he is yours to love and care for and come under.
[time=2288] Wives be subject to your husbands as to the Lord.
[time=2297] Now listen, on the submission thing, you don't follow him into sin.
[time=2304] You don't come under him into sin.
[time=2312] You don't-- who Potasso?
[time=2313] You don't come under him into immorality.
[time=2317] You don't come under him into physical danger.
[time=2320] You don't come under him into abuse.
[time=2325] You don't come under him into putting the kids' lives in danger.
[time=2330] You also probably aren't the only one who should determine these things, not that you're not clear thinking, not that you're not wise.
[time=2336] But this is where when you bump into situations like this, you get the chance to stop and ask for help.
[time=2343] You get the chance to stop and ask for wisdom and guidance.
[time=2347] And that's why we're here to offer you the wisdom and guidance that you would need as shepherds who love their sheep.
[time=2355] But other than those things, God's word is really, really clear that you are to offer willingly and lovingly your respect.
[time=2366] You're to try and help him succeed.
[time=2369] You're to come alongside him in a supportive fashion.
[time=2372] You're to encourage him.
[time=2374] You're to follow him graciously and applaud even
[time=2380] his flawed efforts.
[time=2381] That doesn't mean that flawed efforts get a pass.
[time=2388] It doesn't mean that it's OK for him just to offer up D+ work all the time.
[time=2394] That's not the point there.
[time=2395] We'll talk to him next week about his D+ efforts.
[time=2399] Amen?
[time=2401] Well, there's a lot of ladies there.
[time=2402] But we're not talking about his D+ efforts.
[time=2408] Right now, we're talking about your response to them and what your response does to his willingness and his readiness
[time=2419] to even make a, what, effort.
[time=2422] Yeah, there are some things you don't--
[time=2428] Hupa Tasso, there are some things you don't fall under on.
[time=2432] And we can help you think through and deal with those things.
[time=2435] But other than that, he calls you to a gracious, loving, humble, willing following of him and a willingness and a readiness to help him and wives.
[time=2449] The question that you've got to ask yourselves this morning-- and this used to be-- it's like, it's like money.
[time=2455] I used to struggle teaching on money when I was younger.
[time=2459] I used to struggle when I was younger, standing up in front of a room full of wives, not ever having been one.
[time=2467] And I've just learned over the years, you know what, it doesn't matter.
[time=2473] This matters.
[time=2475] And you've all, so many of you, have given me the privilege of living and walking through life with you.
[time=2483] And I know you, and you've been so gracious in your willingness to let me know you.
[time=2489] And I've been married for 22 years, and I understand a little bit about all this.
[time=2494] And so it's no problem at all to stand here and talk to you about these things.
[time=2499] I do it willingly, and I do it because I believe God's word calls us to.
[time=2504] And wives, you know that there are some things going on in your heart and soul.
[time=2510] I wrote down, wives, why don't you submit?
[time=2512] It's pretty clear that a loving God, not a mean God,
[time=2520] anybody think he's mean?
[time=2522] He gave his son, gals, to die for you.
[time=2527] He's gone out of his way to redeem you.
[time=2529] Scriptures are filled with descriptions of him as your leader and one who loves you and protects and is there for you.
[time=2538] He's not a mean male God, trying to make your life miserable.
[time=2543] He loves you.
[time=2545] And this God who loves you says, my design for you ladies is this, so why don't you?
[time=2552] Why so many times do you struggle with this endeavor?
[time=2558] And you're gonna see a list here on the screen and I'm not trying to be funny.
[time=2566] I used to bring jokes about men and women on these messages and try and make it lighthearted.
[time=2571] I'm not trying to be lighthearted anymore.
[time=2573] I just want you to see the truth and I want you to be willing to say the truth to yourself because sometimes, hear how I said that, sometimes you are not submissive, you are controlling, manipulative.
[time=2587] Sometimes you're critical of him.
[time=2595] Threatening.
[time=2596] Sometimes you're demeaning.
[time=2604] Sometimes you're not gracious, you're harsh.
[time=2608] Some of you, ladies are wired in such a way that there's kind of like not a mean bone in your body.
[time=2616] Some of you aren't wired that way.
[time=2619] Some of you are.
[time=2621] And those of you who are just really kind of kind and fun and upbeat gal, sometimes your ugly sinfulness in this arena is just kind of a passive rebellion.
[time=2631] You just nicely with a smile on your face.
[time=2635] Say nope.
[time=2641] Not doing it.
[time=2643] Can I get you something?
[time=2652] Why don't you submit?
[time=2653] Why does this list sometimes really describe
[time=2659] the way in which you treat him and interact with him?
[time=2665] Why when you realize there's so much at stake
[time=2671] with maybe a daughter or two or three or four, maybe you got kids in the home that are watching, taking mental notes.
[time=2682] Why do you choose that list so many times?
[time=2689] Two things.
[time=2696] I want you to think about this week.
[time=2697] We're gonna come back next week.
[time=2699] Guys, you know what?
[time=2701] Don't get too excited.
[time=2702] There's a list coming for us.
[time=2703] It's just as painful.
[time=2705] Questions are gonna be just as direct.
[time=2709] So this isn't about keeping score.
[time=2711] There's two reasons, ladies, that as a wife, you struggle with submitting and that you tend to move at times in the direction of that list.
[time=2720] Number one is you are a daughter of Eve.
[time=2723] And I just want you to write that down.
[time=2724] You're a daughter of Eve.
[time=2727] Genesis three.
[time=2730] As you read the account of the temptation there between the serpent and the woman, it is clear as day that Eve wanted out from under.
[time=2740] She wanted out.
[time=2743] The lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the boastful pride of life gets thrown out there on a silver platter.
[time=2749] The enemy makes it so very clear of what she could have and what she should have and how good it would be for her.
[time=2756] And she crumbles.
[time=2758] She wants out from under what God had designed.
[time=2762] And she wanted what she wanted when she wanted it and off she went to get it.
[time=2768] Does it sound familiar?
[time=2772] What she wants, when she wants it
[time=2781] and off she goes to get it, exercising the control that Eve was so guilty of exercising and so thoroughly passed on to you.
[time=2794] You're sinful, just like I am
[time=2801] and we'll get to mine next week.
[time=2802] But you're sinful, ladies.
[time=2805] And your sin in relationship to your husband looks like that list.
[time=2812] That's what it looks like.
[time=2815] Why do you struggle to submit because you're a daughter of Eve?
[time=2819] Because that sin was passed along to you as a woman.
[time=2824] And secondly, not only are you a daughter of Eve,
[time=2830] but the other reason why you struggle with this is because you're married to us.
[time=2834] Tried not to be funny there, but I guess it just is to a degree.
[time=2842] What do I mean by that?
[time=2843] I'm not excusing you, I'm not letting you off the hook.
[time=2846] We're talking about, remember the question, why do you struggle with this?
[time=2850] You struggle with this because this was designed by God to be such a mutual thing.
[time=2857] This was designed by God for you to do this and for me to do this and because we're doing this 100% in a reciprocal way with each other, boom.
[time=2867] We're in God's design, we're in His will.
[time=2870] But the fact is you're married to us.
[time=2872] And we don't do that.
[time=2874] We don't love you like Christ loved the church.
[time=2878] We don't give ourselves up for you.
[time=2881] We don't nurture you.
[time=2882] We don't cultivate you in the word.
[time=2885] We don't present you spotless and without wrinkle very well.
[time=2889] And it leaves you hurting, it leaves you empty, it leaves you sad, it leaves you angry.
[time=2894] And then you forget that it's not supposed to be conditional.
[time=2903] It's supposed to be unconditional.
[time=2906] And so you struggle and I'll say it to you this way.
[time=2910] And you could say it both ways.
[time=2911] You could say it this way.
[time=2912] Men, husbands, I believe, lead wives into temptation by not loving them the way that Christ loved the church.
[time=2923] You choose to be unsubnest.
[time=2927] You choose to be ungracious.
[time=2929] You choose to be unkind.
[time=2932] You choose to be critical and harsh.
[time=2934] You choose to exercise, control and manipulation.
[time=2937] I don't choose that for you.
[time=2939] Your husband doesn't, but we, I believe it's safe to say, lead you into temptation.
[time=2945] We make that an even greater option by the pathetic ongoing lack at times of love.
[time=2953] I also think it's true that you lead us into temptation.
[time=2963] Because when you're unkind and ungracious and when you're critical and when you exercise control and manipulation, it leaves him feeling enormously empty and diminished and demeaned.
[time=2976] And so we don't love you like Christ loved the church 'cause we forget it's supposed to be unconditional and we go conditional on you and the whole thing gets messy.
[time=2993] So wives, last thing we're gonna go.
[time=2996] Told you we'd get back to it.
[time=3000] I think, I think it's the, I think this is the deal.
[time=3004] I think this is the whole bollowax right here.
[time=3007] Wives, be subject to your husbands as to the Lord.
[time=3012] See, when you study this verse in the original language,
[time=3019] I wish I could just show it to you.
[time=3021] I mean, when you really break it down, what you realize is that the whole verse is about wives being submissive to God.
[time=3027] That's the verse.
[time=3029] Wives, be submissive to the Lord and in your submission to the Lord, you'll be submissive to your husband.
[time=3037] I love what it says again here in my notes
[time=3044] because the obedient spiritual wives, supreme submission is to the Lord.
[time=3049] Her attitude is that she lovingly submits as an act of obedience to the Lord who has given this command as his will.
[time=3058] Know what the will of God is for you.
[time=3060] She submits as an act of obedience to the Lord who has given this command as his will for her.
[time=3066] Regardless of her husband's personal worthiness, he's not worthy of my submission.
[time=3075] He's a joke.
[time=3079] He's a flake.
[time=3081] I don't like the way he does this.
[time=3085] You've no idea how difficult he is to live with.
[time=3088] It's hard, it is.
[time=3092] I wouldn't diminish or invalidate any of those statements.
[time=3097] And your call, just like mine, is to love God and follow him and obey him over and above all else.
[time=3106] And he says in his design, he's going to bless and honor you through your obedience.
[time=3112] So who put us all?
[time=3113] He says, so come under what may be very difficult to come under, but understand that you're coming under me.
[time=3122] Coming under, listen, coming under the Lord is a lot different than coming under me.
[time=3129] Ask her, she'll tell you.
[time=3131] I'm a mess.
[time=3137] Most guys in this room with a little moment of humility would say the same thing.
[time=3142] We are so clueless on these things at times.
[time=3146] We want to try, we want to get better.
[time=3149] Sometimes we fail miserably.
[time=3151] And it's just saying, if you want to do this right, ladies, you fall under him, capital H.
[time=3158] And that's how you view it.
[time=3161] I was thinking about it this morning, driving in, I was thinking about it like this.
[time=3167] I'm really proud of my son.
[time=3170] Most of you know Russell.
[time=3172] You've been a great family to him over these years and he's got some opportunities ahead of him.
[time=3177] And really just the next few months, he'll be up at Michigan State, God's giving him the gift of playing basketball more than the basketball.
[time=3185] I'm proud, Deborah and I are proud of the way.
[time=3188] He's carried himself for the character and the integrity that he's shown.
[time=3192] But nonetheless, he's got a great opportunity, basketball-wise, coming up.
[time=3197] And I was thinking about what I'd tell him on a number of fronts and on one front, I was kind of laughing to myself this morning, thinking about you ladies in this submission thing.
[time=3205] So hang on while I tie submission and basketball together.
[time=3208] In like, before the calendar year's over, it's kind of weird to think about.
[time=3214] Before the calendar year's over, he'll be shooting a free throw.
[time=3221] In front of 20,000 people who will be screaming their heads off at him to miss it.
[time=3229] 20,000 people with annoying clappers and all kinds of things going on.
[time=3234] And there will be television cameras from ESPN and CBS in that gym focused on his face as he's shooting a free throw with the whole world watching.
[time=3251] So that's big, that's hard.
[time=3255] And I thought, you know what I want to tell him?
[time=3258] I'm going to tell him before he leaves.
[time=3259] I'm going to say, hey, dude, just remember the driveway.
[time=3265] That's just a lot easier.
[time=3270] Just remember the hundreds of hours that we spent on that driveway when you were home.
[time=3278] And a little kid and you spray painted your number on the top corner, and Tom and Cindy's house is behind it, you could see it through the metal.
[time=3285] And when you're standing at Assembly Hall, or when you're standing at Minnesota, or when you're standing at Rupp Arena, just, I'll just tell him, just close your eyes and think about 4707 Crawford.
[time=3298] That's easier.
[time=3301] Right?
[time=3304] That's everyday stuff.
[time=3306] I know that like the back of my hand.
[time=3308] And wives, I just want to tell you, I know he's hard at times.
[time=3313] I know it feels like a big crowd.
[time=3315] I know it feels impossible.
[time=3317] I know it feels overwhelming.
[time=3318] I know it feels as if the entire room is against you.
[time=3321] You just close your eyes and picture a Lord whose love is great, whose commitment to you has been unending and perfect.
[time=3333] Remember a Lord who's there close and near and not far away, take a deep breath, shoot it like you're in the driveway.
[time=3341] Amen?
[time=3343] Stand and pray with me.
[time=3345] Would you this morning?
[time=3346] Father God, we're grateful for your word as always thankful for how direct it is and how it reaches into the everyday of our lives.
[time=3359] God, we're thankful this morning for the wives in this room, many of whom, many of whom, while they struggle with those things on the screen.
[time=3368] God, they are faithful in their efforts to try with your help and the encouragement of others to be the wife that you've called them to be.
[time=3378] To come under at times, a difficult man who isn't perfect, who makes mistakes, who hurts them deeply.
[time=3385] But God, I pray today, in many in the room, pray with me, that you would strengthen our women, our wives, that they could in that relationship fulfill your design, that in fulfilling your design, God, that their families would be blessed, that their daughters would be able to see, not a perfect 'cause no one's looking for that, but a healthy example of a mom who with God's help and the encouragement of others is trying her best to honor.
[time=3412] God, what you've laid out for them.
[time=3415] God, I pray as husbands that we would be willing to come next week and listen to the very clear directive that you give us.
[time=3421] God help us to understand that it says in 1 Peter that we are to live with our wives in an understanding way, that we are to exercise great sympathy and we are to exercise great sensitivity and exercise great wisdom in the way that we invite them not demand from them obedience to your design.
[time=3445] Father God, we love you.
[time=3448] We want to be obedient.
[time=3450] Children of God who are subject to each other.
[time=3454] We look forward to what you'll teach us in the days to come, give us strength to continue to read this chapter.
[time=3460] Give us perseverance to continue to take it in, no matter how badly it may make us feel, no matter the level of conviction.
[time=3468] God, give us humility to ask for help from others where we need it and we'll thank you for all that you'll do through this.
[time=3476] In the whole room, I agreed with the prayer and said amen.
[time=3480] God bless you, we'll see you next week.
[time=3483] (upbeat music)
