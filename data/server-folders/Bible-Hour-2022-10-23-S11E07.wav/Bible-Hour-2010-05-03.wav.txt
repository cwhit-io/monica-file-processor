[time=299] - If you believe that this morning, please say amen.
[time=305] (audience applauds) - Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast today.
[time=313] We're really thankful to have you with us and I am so very thankful that we find ourselves at the end of our mini series, if you will, and our study of Ephesians.
[time=325] We've spent the last several weeks focusing on the great truth, the relevant, much needed truth of chapter five.
[time=334] If you've been watching, you know that we've given chapter five a special emphasis here at Blackhawk and appropriately so.
[time=342] It's a chapter that deals with God's design for us as we navigate in the sexual immorality, impurity, greed, relationships, husbands and wives world.
[time=356] I mean, so much of our world today is about these things and chapter five gives us a way to navigate by knowing God's design for how believers are to handle and approach these issues.
[time=369] We come today in the message to the section in chapter five towards the end about how husbands are supposed to approach their responsibility and their opportunity with wives, God's design for a husband.
[time=384] And I wanna just say this to you before we jump in in the message and before you hear what we had to say on this morning, guys, I believe that for the most part, really across the board, the success of a marriage and the success of a family, I think, guys, for the most part across the board when you see God's design and how he has placed the mantle of leadership and love and responsibility squarely on the shoulders and the heart of a man.
[time=413] I'm not saying that women don't play a role.
[time=416] We've been very clear in recent weeks that women wives do play a role.
[time=420] There is a significant responsibility that God has placed on them as he's called them to respect and live in submission to a husband.
[time=429] But guys, really, when you think about it, God says for us, we are to love and lead.
[time=435] And loving and leading, I think, requires initiative.
[time=439] And really, I think this begins with us.
[time=441] And so I wanna just encourage you guys to listen today, to listen maybe at a level that you haven't in the past.
[time=448] I wanna encourage you young men.
[time=453] I wanna encourage you older husbands to watch today and listen and allow the spirit of God and the word of God to penetrate your heart and your mind maybe at a level it never has before.
[time=465] I believe with all of my heart that so much of what we're facing today in society, so much of what we're facing today as we watch the home and the family deteriorate, is the result of men, husbands and dads, not being who God designed them to be.
[time=484] And so today watch, if you will, and listen, to God's designed for a man, God's designed for a husband.
[time=490] And I hope it will change your life as it's been changing mine.
[time=494] I can't wait to see what God will do with this in your life.
[time=497] Tell your friends about it.
[time=498] Pass it on to your sons.
[time=500] And let's see what God will do in the hearts of men as we attempt to live in relationship with our wives by God's design.
[time=508] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=509] I hope you're encouraged.
[time=510] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=514] [MUSIC - 37 seconds]
[time=556] Just as I am [MUSIC] Just as I am [MUSIC] And making mine [MUSIC] To rid my soul [MUSIC] Of one God, God [MUSIC] To lead us [MUSIC] God in death [MUSIC] Be sorrowed [MUSIC] Of God I come [MUSIC] I come [MUSIC]
[time=603] [MUSIC - 37 seconds]
[time=645] - Let's stand together as we sing this next verse.
[time=652] [MUSIC - 113 seconds]
[time=770] And I'm welcome with open arms.
[time=775] Praise God, just as I am.
[time=800] [MUSIC]
[time=862] As we make our way back to our series, the truth, the way, and the life we've given ourselves to kind of a series within a series we've given some weeks here to some special emphasis and concentration on the fifth chapter of Ephesians, a chapter that speaks to the truth about how we are to navigate not only this culture and this world, but the issues that this culture and this world throw at us by the moment when it relates to immorality and purity, greed, the husband-wife relationship, God's design for purity and integrity and character in the midst of a broken and perverse world.
[time=903] And last week we spent some time, as many of you wives know, talking to you as wives about your role, what God has designed for you as a wife and the husband-wife relationship and I can't tell you how proud I am of you as wives.
[time=919] I say that because so many times when we get to that subject matter because of the message of this world, because of what so many have tried to do with what God's word says to wives, they've tried to paint it as chauvinistic, they've tried to paint it as cruel, they've tried to paint it as somehow demeaning or diminishing and to hear from so many of you wives how thankful you are for a loving Heavenly Father who has set out before you a design for marriage that he promises and you know in your heart can bring peace and joy and fulfillment.
[time=959] It was very encouraging.
[time=960] Thank you for your notes and your emails and some of the conversations that we've had with wives since last Sunday.
[time=967] There were just a few things I wanted to come back and touch on briefly, and then we will make our way to the husbands.
[time=973] I've actually never seen wives pushing husbands into a worship center so quickly.
[time=978] As many of you were pushing them in this morning, I saw wives giving husbands new notebooks with pens and I promise you ladies, we're going to get to those guys here in just a moment, but let me just say a couple of things to you ladies.
[time=990] Ephesians 5 is where we were versus 22 and 24 is where we found ourselves last week.
[time=996] Let me read this to you again this morning and just say a couple of things before we move on.
[time=1001] God's designed for a wife.
[time=1003] Wives be subject to your own husbands as to the who.
[time=1007] Say it to the Lord.
[time=1009] For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ also is the head of the church.
[time=1014] He himself Christ being the savior of the body, the body of Christ.
[time=1020] But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in how many things.
[time=1030] In everything it says.
[time=1032] And I want to just give you a few things to think about.
[time=1035] Ladies, some more things just to consider.
[time=1037] I think it's important to live fully.
[time=1039] I hope you'll write this down.
[time=1040] To live fully and meaningfully within God's design as a wife.
[time=1046] What do I mean by that?
[time=1048] To contribute all that God intended you to bring as a wife to this divine picture of marriage.
[time=1058] In order for that to happen from your end of this thing, here are some things I think you've got to keep in mind.
[time=1065] To live fully and meaningfully within God's design as a wife.
[time=1068] Number one, your relationship, ladies, your relationship with God must be primary.
[time=1077] I understand that we're talking about a relationship between you and your husband.
[time=1081] I understand we're talking about the reality of what goes on between you as a woman and him as a man.
[time=1088] I get that, but I want to remind you this morning that what should be and has to be, because of how God designed it, primary is your relationship, ladies, with him, capital H.
[time=1102] That is what must be central.
[time=1105] Why do I say this?
[time=1106] Where do we find this?
[time=1108] Let me hear the pages turn back to 1 Peter chapter 3.
[time=1112] Would you do that for me this morning, everybody?
[time=1114] Turn back to 1 Peter chapter 3.
[time=1116] Peter writes to the church at large during these days, and he comes to chapter 3.
[time=1121] Much of what we'll read here will sound very familiar.
[time=1124] Again, God giving his loving design to the wife so she can understand how it is she is to function and how it is she is to think, how it is she is to live, it says in 1 Peter 3.1, in the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands
[time=1144] so that even if any of them are disobedient, referring to the husbands, so if any of them are disobedient to the word, they, the husband, might be one brought back without a word from you the wife so that even if any of them are
[time=1165] disobedient to the word, they may be one without a word by the behavior of the wife.
[time=1175] The husband gets one back.
[time=1182] The husband gets drawn back to what is right, not by the CD you leave on his pillow, not by the book you nag him to read,
[time=1193] not by the lecture you give him day after day after day.
[time=1197] No, it's done without a word.
[time=1201] By the way you live.
[time=1204] By the way you carry yourself, by your behavior, what kind of behavior, as they observe your chaste, your pure,
[time=1214] and respectful behavior, Ephesians 5, language, making its way back in there, husbands love your wives, wives respect your husbands, your adornment, ladies, please look at that, your adornment, that which is beautiful about you, that which is attractive about you,
[time=1236] that which is pretty about you, your adornment must not be
[time=1242] merely external, braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry,
[time=1248] or putting on dresses, but let it be the hidden person, the hidden woman, if you will, of the what, heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit which is precious in the sight of God.
[time=1266] It is your chaste and respectful behavior.
[time=1270] It is your willingness to win him back without a word.
[time=1274] It is your readiness to adorn yourself, not with external beauty that draws attention to your external features, but instead with a beauty that comes from your heart and your soul, and all of you, wives in the room, most of you, I would guess, would hear this and say, wow, there's just so much about that, it really does seem right, that really does seem healthy, how in the world can I do that?
[time=1304] Well, thank goodness for the example of other women who have gone before you as noted in verse five, for here you go, for in this way, in former times, the holy women also, there's the phrase,
[time=1322] who hoped in who?
[time=1328] Who hoped in their efforts to change the husband?
[time=1333] No.
[time=1335] The holy women of old understood that in God's design, the only thing for them to do was to walk with, be intimate with, have great trust in, have their hope firmly planted in who, say it again, God.
[time=1351] Ladies, your relationship with Him, capital H is the one that will sustain you, it is the one that will grow you, it is the one that will encourage you, it is the one that will give you the strength to pursue all those things we talked about last week, your relationship with God must be primary.
[time=1373] Secondly, you must come to terms with which approach, this is just real simple, I'm just going to say it quickly, you must come to terms with which approach, which game plan, which mindset, regarding marriage, you're going to devote yourself to, which mindset?
[time=1388] What I mean by that is simply this, wives, this mindset, this
[time=1395] approach that we're just trying to give you an understanding of in recent days, you will not find this in people magazine.
[time=1405] You won't find this in O, you won't find this on TV, you won't
[time=1411] find it in the movie theaters, you won't find this in current mass media, you won't find this anywhere in this culture that's
[time=1421] speaking into your life and your world moment by moment.
[time=1427] The message that you'll hear in all of those places is really antithetical to this, it will try to, because the enemies behind it move you in a different direction, to hold on to different values, to stake your claim at different places, God never intended you to, it will do everything it can to move you toward passive or aggressive rebellion from this.
[time=1451] So really ladies, at some point, we just have to decide, who are you
[time=1458] going to listen to when it comes to being a wife?
[time=1463] Them or him?
[time=1466] Him capital H.
[time=1471] And that got me thinking this week about something that I think it's important for us to at least think about, think about this with me, because as I'm thinking about these things, you know, yes, I think about my wife, yes, I think about you as wives.
[time=1485] I also think about my daughters, I have three of them, 14, 12 and eight, and they're all growing up, and it's happening quicker than I ever thought it would, and I think about your daughters.
[time=1499] And I think about young ladies who I've watched grow up in this culture
[time=1505] and, you know, with us trying to give them this at the same time, and you just got to kind of step back and think about this, look at what has transpired in the last 50 years, and I'm not just talking outside the church, I'm talking even inside the church.
[time=1519] Over the last 50 years, the message that we've delivered again and again for some decent reasons, and I think for a lot of bad ones, what we've told young 10-year-old girls, what we've told 14-year-old girls with hopes and dreams and gifts, which aren't bad, what they've heard from culture for the most part in recent days has been you can do anything you want to do.
[time=1545] You are strong, you are gifted, you are talented.
[time=1549] Don't let anybody ever hold you back from anything you'd want to accomplish.
[time=1556] Sound familiar?
[time=1558] So many times the message that young women get is they should let no one or nothing stand in their way of being and doing all that they want to do.
[time=1570] And while I, for my own daughters, would want them to experience their dreams and their goals, while I'd want them to use their gifts and their talents to experience all that God would have for them, and no, I wouldn't want them to resign themselves to a life of nothingness.
[time=1589] I want them to step forward and see what they can do and accomplish, but you grow up a generation of young women who have been told from day one,
[time=1600] you are in charge of your destiny.
[time=1604] You are in control of your world.
[time=1607] Don't you ever take no from anybody?
[time=1613] And oh yeah, submit to your husband.
[time=1618] Come under him who may not share your dreams, who may not, these days,
[time=1627] who may not make as much money as you.
[time=1632] You see what I'm saying?
[time=1634] And I'm not just trying to blow up one and go the other way.
[time=1637] I'm just saying we've got to be really careful that we teach our young women the great and prioritized value of this.
[time=1647] I'll trust God with their hopes and their dreams, but we've got to teach them to trust God with how to conduct themselves in a marriage, amen?
[time=1659] And that's why we preach this, this is why we teach this.
[time=1664] Lastly, I'll say this to live fully and meaningfully within God's design as a wife, you must have help.
[time=1670] You must have help.
[time=1673] I've never seen a God honoring husband respecting wife who didn't have highly personal,
[time=1682] highly consistent, highly invasive accountability.
[time=1691] Other ladies, maybe even most likely older women coming alongside,
[time=1699] welcomed into your life to speak truth and encouragement and admonishment
[time=1707] and love into your life.
[time=1710] To say to you, well done, to say to you, what are you thinking?
[time=1716] To say to you, slow down, to say to you, wait a minute, let's pray about this.
[time=1721] I've never seen a woman move toward God's design with great meaning and great success
[time=1728] without help.
[time=1730] You just weren't designed to do that alone, and if you need help on that front, I hope you'll ask for it.
[time=1738] We'd love nothing more than to give you that accountability and that encouragement that you need so desperately.
[time=1745] Okay.
[time=1747] All right, guys, crack open those new notebooks.
[time=1750] Ephesians 5, 25 to 33, would you in honor of God's word stand and let me read this to you this morning, husbands and wives, all of us.
[time=1761] It says in Ephesians 5, 25, it says, husbands, love your wives just as Christ also loved
[time=1770] the church and gave himself up for her so that he might sanctify her,
[time=1776] having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that he might present to himself his bride, the church, in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she would be holy and blameless.
[time=1793] So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies.
[time=1798] He who loves his own wife loves himself for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it just as Christ also does the church,
[time=1811] because we are members of his body for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh.
[time=1823] This mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
[time=1828] Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife,
[time=1834] even as himself and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband.
[time=1841] Oh, Father in Heaven, as we continue before you this morning in your presence,
[time=1848] will you this morning keep your hand, God, and your word and your spirit, at work and active in the hearts and minds of the husbands in this room today, God, there can be times as husbands where we can stand in pride and arrogance.
[time=1866] God, there are times when we can be too slow to learn and not very quick to listen.
[time=1873] There can be times where because of pain or confusion or things done or things said,
[time=1879] God, that we can fold our arms and hold our ground, and God, you're bigger than all of that,
[time=1888] and your love for us is great, and may we as men stand with our arms open and our hearts ready to receive the truth implanted.
[time=1897] May we hear it, may we own it, may we give ourselves to applying it.
[time=1902] God, may you change us and grow us as husbands this morning.
[time=1907] It's in your son's name, we pray. Amen. You can be seated.
[time=1912] So let me just paint this picture for you quickly, then we're going to come back to the passage.
[time=1917] Husbands, in the room this morning, those of you watching on the broadcast, others of you listening online, God's designed for a husband.
[time=1925] Within the biblical picture of marriage is to be a man who is relationally, spiritually,
[time=1931] and emotionally strong, sacrificial, and attentive.
[time=1937] Can I say that again? It is God's design for a husband within the biblical picture of marriage.
[time=1943] It's to be a man who is relationally, spiritually, emotionally strong,
[time=1949] sacrificial, and attentive. He is to lead.
[time=1953] He is to love. He is to care for you as a wife.
[time=1958] God has required him to shepherd and protect and give himself completely for you and to you.
[time=1967] This is God's design, and here's the deal. He's supposed to do all the above unconditionally.
[time=1974] We said it last week, when we were talking to wives, we'll say it again this morning as we speak to husbands.
[time=1979] This is unconditional in God's design. Good day, bad day.
[time=1985] Whether she's cranky or sweet, whether the kids are being good or they're not,
[time=1992] whether she's 22 and young and chipper, or 82 and winding down.
[time=1998] Bless you, 82-year-olds.
[time=2003] He says, "Lover, sacrifice for her. Be attentive to her."
[time=2011] And while God will hold him accountable for his choices on these fronts, ladies, and I say this to you this morning because I said it to the guys last week and it's just true both ways,
[time=2023] while I believe God will hold him as a husband accountable for his choices on these fronts.
[time=2029] I believe God holds you accountable for how difficult or how easy you make this.
[time=2036] You have the capacity, ladies.
[time=2041] I don't know how it works really, but I just know it's this way because I am one.
[time=2047] You have the capacity as a wife to inspire him to great heights on this front.
[time=2058] You, in the way that you speak and all the things we talked about last week,
[time=2064] you have the ability to inspire him to heights never before seen.
[time=2070] You have the capacity to, in the way that you, Ephesians 5, 33, respect him, lift him up,
[time=2078] shoulders back, head held high.
[time=2081] He thinks he's got an S on his chest.
[time=2087] When you make that easy for him, which is hard to do at times, he makes it hard for you to make it easy.
[time=2097] I understand that God says it's a hundred percent both ways.
[time=2105] You can inspire him or you can discourage and diminish his efforts husbands.
[time=2111] Here we go.
[time=2112] It's not a mystery.
[time=2114] It is right here for us.
[time=2116] Difficult.
[time=2117] I know at times to apply, but it's not hard to see.
[time=2120] Paul lays it out for you right here in just a few verses.
[time=2123] Write it down.
[time=2124] He's an honoring husband.
[time=2126] A God honoring wife loving if you will husband will do these things.
[time=2132] Number one, he will sacrifice for her.
[time=2136] You see it there in 525.
[time=2138] Love your wives.
[time=2140] Just as Christ also loved the church and gave himself up for her.
[time=2146] Several years ago, we taught this passage and I put a picture on the screen from the passion of the Christ
[time=2153] of Jesus on the cross.
[time=2155] It was a close up of his beaten and brutalized face and body.
[time=2160] It was a picture of him bleeding and dying and gasping for air with blood all over his skull and his body bruised.
[time=2172] And I reminded you and I reminded myself as husbands the links to which we are to go.
[time=2179] To care for and love her.
[time=2182] Biblically speaking is that picture.
[time=2186] That you would stop at nothing.
[time=2190] To give yourself to her.
[time=2194] That you would allow no one or nothing to be more important to you than her.
[time=2199] To sacrifice for her is a pattern of choosing her, not you.
[time=2204] That's real simple I know but I think it's powerful.
[time=2206] It's a pattern in your life guys of choosing her.
[time=2211] Not you for her benefit.
[time=2214] Wives just like we said the husbands last week a husband would never demand submission.
[time=2220] A wife would never demand this.
[time=2223] You don't stand there with a spoon in your hand saying sacrifice for me.
[time=2232] Remember you can inspire him or you can diminish the effort.
[time=2237] Husbands you are to stop at nothing.
[time=2240] To make her the priority.
[time=2242] To sacrifice listen your time, your enjoyment, your freedom, your plans.
[time=2252] She's a good wife.
[time=2253] She probably wants you to have fun and plans and enjoyment.
[time=2259] This is about you making sure that there would never even be a hint in her mind that there was something or someone more important to you know.
[time=2268] You're going to sacrifice.
[time=2270] That's going to be the pattern of your life and your love and your relationship with her sacrifice.
[time=2276] I give for you and I do it willingly.
[time=2280] I do it lovingly.
[time=2281] I do it freely.
[time=2282] I do it often.
[time=2286] A God honoring husband will sacrifice for her.
[time=2289] He will sanctify her.
[time=2291] Look at verse 26.
[time=2293] 526 says so that he loves her and gives himself up for her so that he might sanctify.
[time=2300] That word speaks to the spiritual maturation process of her becoming more and more like Christ so that he the husband might sanctify her the wife having cleansed her.
[time=2313] He having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word.
[time=2320] Here we see the word of God coming into the picture.
[time=2323] Here we see spiritual truth making its way into the marriage relationship.
[time=2329] Here we see truth and the word of God and spiritual principle being brought to the marriage relationship specifically to the wife by the husband.
[time=2342] Now husbands hear that.
[time=2344] They freak out.
[time=2345] They go, "Oh my gosh.
[time=2346] I don't know how to do what you do, Kelly." But see, we're not talking about you doing with her or what I do.
[time=2353] Don't confuse spiritually making an investment in your wife with preaching.
[time=2358] Don't confuse it with leading a church.
[time=2364] Ask her what you could pray for three times a week.
[time=2375] Ask her what's going on in her heart these days.
[time=2380] That's difficult or confusing that you could pray for her about and watch the tears well up in her eyes.
[time=2393] Watch how simple it is to make a spiritual investment.
[time=2398] If you asked her three times in a week how you could pray and then three times that week before you go to bed, before the eyes close, you just say, "Hey, could we pray about those things that you told me about?"
[time=2409] And you never know she might say to you, "How could I pray for you?" And then you might get to pray for her.
[time=2414] She might get to pray for you.
[time=2418] And then you might even share that with a friend of yours who's holding you accountable because I never met a God honoring husband who did it alone.
[time=2428] And then maybe he says to you, "Wow, what she's asking you to pray for." That's what we were looking at a couple weeks ago and then you go, "Yeah, that's right." And you go back to that and then the next time you sit down, you tell her, "Hey, I found this verse."
[time=2441] Or you could give credit to your friend or you could take the credit yourself.
[time=2447] And you just do your best to bring the truth into that relationship and you make sure that she understands and knows that what's happening in her life spiritually means a lot to you.
[time=2461] You make it a point for you and her to be in a small group.
[time=2466] You make it a point that you and her are connected in a smaller setting.
[time=2470] You make it a point that you and her are here at 9 or 1045 on a Sunday.
[time=2476] Not because that's what good Christians do, but because you know you both desperately need it.
[time=2485] You sacrifice for her, you sanctify her, you protect her.
[time=2492] Verse 27, guys, this is so important.
[time=2496] It says in 27 that he might present that he, the groom, might present to himself the church is bride.
[time=2503] And all her glory, having no spot, no wrinkle, or any such thing.
[time=2511] This is not a verse on dermatology efforts.
[time=2515] This isn't about Botox.
[time=2518] This is about spiritual heart stuff.
[time=2522] This is talking about sin.
[time=2525] This is talking about the things that stain her.
[time=2530] And this is a touchy one because I'm going to stand here right now and encourage guys to get involved at a level that sometimes you as wives don't want them involved in.
[time=2540] But God's word says, protect her.
[time=2545] Guys, guys, what are you paying?
[time=2548] You know, what are you paying for you and her or for her to go watch?
[time=2554] On 17 foot high screens in theaters with sense around sound.
[time=2561] What are you taking her to digest into her heart and soul?
[time=2566] What forms of entertainment as a husband and leader and shepherd are you providing?
[time=2575] What is she reading?
[time=2578] Where is she clicking and surfing and what is she browsing on?
[time=2586] What kind of friendships does she have?
[time=2588] What kind of influences are there in her life?
[time=2591] How involved are you men, not in a Gestapo police type fashion, but in a loving shepherd type way?
[time=2599] How involved are you in her life coming alongside her to offer the humble, gentle leadership needed to protect her from an enemy who wants nothing more than to remove her from that protection and send her down destructive deadly roads?
[time=2620] And you say, "Wow, Kelly, that's a little scary.
[time=2623] You want me to start getting involved?" Yes, you know what?
[time=2626] That's amazing to me.
[time=2628] I'll raise my hand on this at times.
[time=2630] It's amazing to me how clueless we are as men because so many times we establish ourselves so distant from what's really going on.
[time=2642] We don't see it.
[time=2643] We don't suspect it.
[time=2644] We don't know anything.
[time=2646] We just think it's great.
[time=2648] And there's times where she needs your loving protection from an enemy who is ever present.
[time=2656] A God-honoring husband, a wife-loving husband, sacrifices for her, sanctifies her, protects her, nourishes her.
[time=2668] You see it there in 29 for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes the husband,
[time=2677] nourishes the wife.
[time=2679] Watch this.
[time=2680] This is a word that carries with it.
[time=2683] Definitely.
[time=2684] It's a nutrition word.
[time=2686] It's a word that has to do with providing the needed sustenance for one to live and for one to live in a healthy way.
[time=2695] And I was thinking about it this week.
[time=2698] We've got some really, really good friends that we're very thankful for who just in, I think, the last month.
[time=2705] It was just last month.
[time=2706] Last month found out that their little girl was diabetic.
[time=2711] And it was a shock and it was a difficult thing to initially kind of come to terms with.
[time=2717] But it was amazing to watch them, all of them in the family.
[time=2721] Amazing to watch them with this little precious girl who was now diabetic and will be for the rest of her life.
[time=2729] To watch them go through the educational process needed to now care for her.
[time=2735] And to watch them come to the realization that now from here on out at 8.30 and 11.30 and 2.30 and fourth.
[time=2743] I may not have all the times right, but every single hour of every single day, there are things to watch for.
[time=2751] There are things that she has to have.
[time=2755] And they are now lovingly responsible for providing her the specific nourishment that she needs to live and to live well.
[time=2764] And you don't parent a young diabetic girl with those kinds of needs from a distance.
[time=2773] You don't stand over there and say, "I hope she's okay." You don't stand at a distance and say, "I hope she eats the right amount of carbs."
[time=2785] And husbands, you don't stand at a distance and say, "I hope she's okay."
[time=2793] "I hope she's not getting into too much sugar." "Hope she's not getting into too much chocolate." "Hope she's not eating too..." "You just don't do that." "No, you just wiggle in there and you just say, "Hey, here I am." "And I want to make sure we're doing okay and I'm doing it because I love you." "So morning, noon and night, I'm not distant. I'm present."
[time=2820] A husband sacrifices for his wife.
[time=2825] A husband sanctifies her spiritually, excuse me.
[time=2828] A husband cooperates with God in the sanctifying process.
[time=2836] He protects her, he nourishes her, and here's the last one, which is really kind of a cool culmination of all of these.
[time=2843] Look at the screen, you guys. The godly, god-honoring, wife-loving husband cherishes her.
[time=2851] And here's the thing about husbands cherishing wives.
[time=2857] A wife who is cherished. It's a unique thing.
[time=2863] When there's a wife who is not perfectly but consistently cherished by her husband,
[time=2870] you understand cherish. It means absolute utter priority.
[time=2876] It means she knows that there isn't anything or anyone that stands in his way of giving to her the love and the devotion
[time=2890] and the nourishment and the involvement that she was designed by God to have.
[time=2894] She knows he doesn't do it perfect, but there's this unique thing.
[time=2897] When you have a wife who is cherished and she's confident and thankful for that, you can just see it. She tells her friends, she tells her kids,
[time=2912] and while everybody in that world knows he's not perfect, there's a sense you get from her that she's secure and confident and thankful
[time=2922] that she feels prioritized and loved in a deep and meaningful way.
[time=2930] Now, there's a lot of you guys in the room, along with me, you know, at times who would hear that and go,
[time=2936] "Hey, okay, I got my pen ready. Could you give me like five bullet points on cherishing her?"
[time=2942] Real quick, Kelly, just come on. I know you know. I'm just telling me I want to do those five things and get that stuff all straightened out because I don't think she really feels that way.
[time=2951] I could give you the five, but instead I'm going to do this.
[time=2959] And ladies, I'm throwing an enormous amount of trust your way on this one.
[time=2965] Guys, if you're interested in leaving her feeling cherished and you'll want to know how to do that for her,
[time=2975] ask her, and she'll help you figure that out.
[time=2987] If she's a good wife, if she's a selfish, manipulative wife, you'll be like cleaning the chimney tonight or something.
[time=2997] This is not a free pass for you ladies to just stick it to them, all right? Ask her.
[time=3005] Say, I want you to feel cherished by me.
[time=3011] I want you to know, Corbin and Tonya come on up as I'm saying this, I want you to know, you say to your wife, I want you to know, deep in your heart, that you are my priority.
[time=3021] I want you to feel and sense that I cherish you above and beyond anything and all else.
[time=3029] What could I do? What could I improve on to help you sense and experience that?
[time=3037] I think it'd be a great question to ask.
[time=3039] And I think there's a lot of wives in this room who would probably give you, as a husband, a lot of help.
[time=3045] Hey, I want you to do this with the time we've got remaining, and we've got some time, please hang in here with me.
[time=3051] I want you to listen to this song that Corbin and Tonya are going to sing for us this morning, a fantastic picture of God's love for his bride.
[time=3061] God's love for his bride, for his beloved.
[time=3065] But it's also because of the nature of the passage that we just went through.
[time=3068] It's a great picture, guys, of the kind of love you can have for your wife.
[time=3073] And so as they sing this song about our God and his love, just everyone be encouraged by that.
[time=3079] But I think husbands and wives can find great encouragement, as this picture is painted, of what a groom can offer his bride.
[time=3090] Listen, be thankful, and be encouraged.
[time=3103] You might be loved, you're my bride, to sing over you is my delight.
[time=3117] Come away with me, my love.
[time=3133] Under my mercy, come and wait, till you're standing face to face.
[time=3147] I've seen those days on you, my child.
[time=3157] You're beautiful to me.
[time=3178] I sing over you, my song of peace.
[time=3184] Cast all your cares down at my feet.
[time=3193] Come and find your rest in me.
[time=3203] I breathe my life inside of you.
[time=3209] I'll bear you up on me, the flames.
[time=3215] I'll guide you in the shadow of my strength.
[time=3222] I'll take you to my quiet waters.
[time=3232] I'll restore your soul.
[time=3235] Come rest in me.
[time=3240] I'm being made home.
[time=3265] You're beautiful to me.
[time=3286] You might be loved, you're my bride, to sing over you is my delight.
[time=3301] Come away with me, my love.
[time=3322] So we hear from Ephesians five, husbands, the design that God has given us as husbands.
[time=3330] You hear a song like that and you sense the sweetness of those words and the tenderness that is God's design for our relationship with her.
[time=3343] And yet so many times that's not how our relationship with her is defined or would be described with all of that as a backdrop.
[time=3355] Why?
[time=3357] Why is it that so many times not all of the time but why more times than you or I would wish?
[time=3366] Why do we speak and communicate with her less and less?
[time=3372] Why do we talk for hours and hours and hours on the phone when I was dating online when maybe many of you were getting together and why would we spend countless amounts of time saying everything that was on our hearts and now why today is it hard to grab a word?
[time=3400] Why do we at times treat the physical encounter trying to be PG here?
[time=3405] Why do we sometimes treat the physical encounter like a NASCAR pit stop when I'm not trying to be funny?
[time=3414] Why is something so special and something so intimate and designed by God to be so personal, treated so quickly and with distance at times?
[time=3431] Why is the very intimacy that it's supposed to breed? Why do we seem a thousand miles away from that as we try to somehow navigate that physical world?
[time=3443] Why do you care more as a husband about a certain hobby than you do her?
[time=3450] And that's if we just base the assessment on time, money and energy spent.
[time=3457] Guys, why do we at times take almost zero initiative, zero, to walk with her and encourage her spiritually?
[time=3469] Why is it that we would monitor and stay in tune with our investments, our projects and our teams more than we would her heart?
