[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] I know as many of you watch this, it is a week removed from this morning, but this morning as I tape this, it's Mother's Day.
[time=42] And so I wanna just say a special Happy Mother's Day and a huge thank you to the moms.
[time=47] And I know there are many in our viewing audience.
[time=50] I meet many of you out in public.
[time=53] We'll talk in the grocery store or at the gas station or out in the public settings.
[time=58] And you're always so kind to me, you're encouraging to me, thanking me for what I do.
[time=63] And I wanna just say to you moms, even though it's a week late, thanks for being a mom.
[time=68] We've designed a service today with you in mind and what a great privilege it was for us to bring these efforts to our family today this Sunday.
[time=79] But as you watch it a week removed, I hope as a mother you'll be reminded of how much you mean in the process of God growing up as people.
[time=90] God's people begin as God's kids and your investment in your children, whether they're young infants, toddlers, adolescents or even older kids, you're ongoing investment moms in their lives, your investment of truth, your investment of love, the investment of your life means a great deal.
[time=111] And so as you watch today, I know you'll hear at the beginning of my message that there's kind of a, kind of a central truth or verse that we picked to kind of provide the foundation for our message today.
[time=124] And I wanna just say it to you quickly and then let you watch the rest of the service.
[time=128] It says in 2 Thessalonians 3.13, do not grow weary of doing good.
[time=135] And I wanna just leave you with that today, moms, young moms and old moms, middle-aged moms, do not grow weary of doing good.
[time=145] And whether you're on your own as a mom or whether you've got a husband who helps a great deal, whether your kids are in a great place or maybe your kids are struggling today, I wanna just encourage you, God's word wants to speak truth and hope into your heart and life, do not grow weary moms of doing good.
[time=165] Thank you for all the good that you do.
[time=167] Thank you for the encouragement that you bring.
[time=169] God bless you, I hope you enjoy the broadcast today.
[time=172] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=174] - See you when Natasha, I'll do it.
[time=176] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 140 seconds]
[time=321] (upbeat music) - Amen, God is great.
[time=337] (audience applauding) (upbeat music) We were watching "Black Hawk" before we came here on the Bible hour and really enjoyed the messages and were challenged by the messages.
[time=356] And we decided that it would be a good idea to come with some prodding from our son.
[time=367] And so we came, and then after we came, probably after about three weeks, we joined an adult Bible fellowship and got to know some people.
[time=382] We came at the right time to where there was an access Black Hawk as well.
[time=388] And so got to meet some people there.
[time=391] That's how we got connected to the ABA.
[time=396] So knowing that people were praying for us and making some friendships and some connections there really helped us.
[time=406] And then we also got involved in the greeter ministry.
[time=410] And by doing that, meeting other people and also the greeter family is in itself its own fellowship.
[time=426] (upbeat music) Authenticity.
[time=433] A close friend of mine, a good friend of yours,
[time=439] somebody that you would have a high regard, you would hold a high regard.
[time=442] We were visiting and I said, boy, I said either Kelly is the real thing or he's a great actor.
[time=452] Because I just get this feeling that he really is genuine and sincere.
[time=458] I'm not telling you that to score any points.
[time=460] I just get that feeling.
[time=462] And Corbin too, you're transparent.
[time=465] And you have hurts and you have good days and you have bad days.
[time=470] And you have good seasons and bad seasons.
[time=473] So I'm sensing that from the leadership of the church.
[time=478] I am Bruce Lobb and I am grateful that God is using Black Hawk to grow me as a disciple.
[time=485] I've seen almost a momentum building
[time=495] over the past few years.
[time=497] We've seen new people become part of the family here.
[time=503] You see it in the, I'm part of the worship ministry here
[time=512] and you see it in the direction that Corbin and the team have been taking our worship.
[time=520] There's just a sense that something almost electrical,
[time=526] something new is something new is gonna happen each Sunday.
[time=530] So there's almost like this expectation of something new.
[time=533] I'm Jonathan Leakedy and I am glad that God is using Black Hawk to grow me as a disciple.
[time=541] [MUSIC - 118 seconds]
[time=664] (upbeat music)
[time=686] [MUSIC - 101 seconds]
[time=790] - Well, my mom has always been really caring, and she always puts the kids before herself, and she just cares a lot about other people, and always works hard for them and not for herself.
[time=799] My mom cares a lot about our spiritual walks and where we are, and she's always very interested and very invested in us, so she's great, because I know that I can go to her for anything, because she has a lot of wisdom and has gone through a lot, so I just really appreciate everything she has to tell me.
[time=815] My mom is retiring this year after
[time=821] 35-plus years of teaching, has been an incredible example to me and to my sister of an excellent teacher, or someone who cares compassionately for their students, somebody who earnestly desires their best, sacrificially serves them.
[time=836] She's been a wonderful example of how Christian education is supposed to look for a generation plus.
[time=843] She's mentored to younger teachers.
[time=846] She's been a great example to me, to my sister, to my own family.
[time=850] Let the wonderful legacy of what Christian education should look like.
[time=853] One thing about my mom is she always came to all of my sporting events.
[time=859] There wasn't a time where she didn't miss a game, and she was always there and always was supportive, and regardless of how I played or how I did, she always made me feel as though I was, you know, that I was the best person out of the field, even though I know that wasn't always true.
[time=875] And she was always such an encourager.
[time=877] That was something I really liked about my mom.
[time=880] My mom wasn't a well-educated lady.
[time=883] She left high school age 16 to work at a creamery, wrapping butter sticks, and every week she handed her check over to her mom to help with the family finances and raise the other kids in the home.
[time=896] One thing I remember about growing up is when I was the only boy, I'm one of four.
[time=902] The only one left at home we'd have cuddle time and we'd color, and she'd read to me.
[time=907] And what he used to do, she'd give me 100 kisses and I'd count them all.
[time=911] My mom was a really consistent mom.
[time=916] She lived what she taught us each day about God and about his word, and wasn't just going to church on Sundays, a family, but lived it.
[time=925] Sometimes we read a lot together, and we'll just go around
[time=931] and talk. We'll talk about just a bunch of different things, but it's just fun sitting down and talking either.
[time=937] I like sitting with her on our couch and reading the Harvey Boy books.
[time=944] And I like making dinner with her sometimes,
[time=950] and I try to care to put in my video games too.
[time=953] We do crafts and we paint our nails together.
[time=959] And she takes us out for movies.
[time=962] It's really fun and I love her.
[time=964] Oh, she's just such an amazing, godly woman.
[time=968] Whenever she learns something new in a Bible study, she's always so willing to share it with me.
[time=974] And she's just such a great example to me, always so encouraging. I love her so much.
[time=979] Well, that's really well said, amen.
[time=982] Thank you, moms. Let's just, real quick, let's just thank all the moms in the room.
[time=988] We want to say a happy Mother's Day to every one of you.
[time=991] Hey, you do a lot.
[time=996] What was said on the video was suffice, but we could add a lot to that.
[time=1001] Every day of your life, to some degree, you're engaged in laundry.
[time=1006] You're doing shopping.
[time=1008] You're giving yourself, many of you are giving yourself to a marriage, trying to be a wife while also being a mother.
[time=1015] Some of you work hard to contribute to the needs of your home.
[time=1018] You're all busy at some point in the week planning, trying to think through the needs of not only your own life, but the lives of those that you're trying to care for, schedules and finances and work events and school events and it takes an enormous amount of time as you plan.
[time=1035] Many of you, I think probably most all of you as moms, pray.
[time=1039] You spend time praying for your family.
[time=1041] You pray for your kids.
[time=1042] You pray for your husband.
[time=1044] You pray for those in your life.
[time=1046] Oftentimes you do all the above at the expense of sleep and oftentimes you're tired.
[time=1052] You read books to your kids.
[time=1055] You help them with their homework.
[time=1057] You help them memorize Bible verses as they hide God's word in their heart.
[time=1062] Many times you're still good for a good time and a lot of fun.
[time=1067] Sometimes you have to bring the hammer and the discipline comes as well.
[time=1071] Either way, you give yourself to a great deal.
[time=1074] And in the midst of all of that, as I thought about mothers today, and I haven't done this, I don't think in the 14 years I've been here in the 10 years, I've stood here in this position with you, trying my best to teach and articulate God's word to you.
[time=1089] I don't think I've ever just done a Mother's Day message.
[time=1092] And so I just felt led to do that in recent weeks.
[time=1095] And as I thought about your life and as I thought about all that you do and all that you invest in, I thought about the contributions that you make.
[time=1104] God just, in a very clear way, I think just gave me, led me to a scripture, led me to a very brief statement in a passage that I wanted to just use this morning as the foundation for some encouragement to you.
[time=1118] Now, the moment I say that I've got a message for mothers today, 90% of the guys just started thinking about lunch.
[time=1126] And I just want to encourage you guys, lunch is going to come and whatever else you're going to do this afternoon or this evening, you'll get there.
[time=1135] But I really want to encourage you as dads, as husbands, as younger men.
[time=1140] I want to encourage you as younger women who aren't mothers yet.
[time=1143] I want to encourage you as older women.
[time=1145] I want to encourage this entire body to listen to what God's word today has to say to mothers because as He speaks to mothers, He speaks to us, He speaks to the body of Christ.
[time=1157] And there will be things for you and I, all of us to hear.
[time=1160] So stay tuned in.
[time=1162] And let's see how we can all be encouraged.
[time=1165] But as I thought about the life of a mom, and I'm thankful for mine, thankful for my own mother.
[time=1172] Don't get to see her very often.
[time=1174] We're looking forward to having her here for graduation next month.
[time=1177] So that'll be fun.
[time=1179] I think about the years and years she invested in my dad and into my life as well.
[time=1184] After their divorce, she spent the next 20 years investing her life in others overseas as a missionary in Russia.
[time=1192] And then for the last seven years in Afghanistan, she's home now investing in her mom, who's 96.
[time=1200] And my mom is her primary caregiver and she's with her 24/7 and doing that with joy in her heart and an incredible spirit.
[time=1210] And I'm thankful for her, thankful for my wife.
[time=1213] And the mothering I see her do day after day after day at a level that sometimes just staggers me.
[time=1220] And I'm grateful for the way in which she does that.
[time=1223] As I thought about my mom, my wife, as I thought about many of you ladies in this family.
[time=1227] You've given me the privilege of getting to know you over these 14 years.
[time=1231] I see your efforts.
[time=1232] I know how hard you work at this.
[time=1235] I also know how difficult it is.
[time=1238] I know it's hard.
[time=1240] And I know it's taxing.
[time=1242] And I know there comes with it great joys and great heartaches.
[time=1246] And so with all of that in view, I wanted to just share with you this brief truth that I think God led me to.
[time=1254] And I want to say it to you this morning.
[time=1256] I think it's what He's put in my heart to say to you.
[time=1259] And it is right from the passage in 2 Thessalonians 3.13 where it says, "In essence, do not grow weary." And I want to say this to you mothers this morning.
[time=1268] Do not grow weary of doing good.
[time=1275] Amen?
[time=1276] Mothers, what you do is good.
[time=1279] Everything mentioned on that video, everything I've tried to relate to you just in these first few moments this morning, all the responsibilities that He's given you, all that you attempt to invest in the hearts and lives of little ones or adolescent ones or even older ones.
[time=1296] Everything that's in front of you, each and every day as a mom, is a good thing that God has given you in order to further that which He's about.
[time=1307] That is the doing good.
[time=1310] Where Paul says here, "Don't grow weary of doing good." The good is giving yourself to those things that further God's work in the hearts and lives of those that you're with.
[time=1320] So we say to you, and I say to each and every one of you this morning, and God's Word says to you, "In all that good that you're engaged in, don't grow weary.
[time=1334] Don't grow weary.
[time=1335] Don't get tired.
[time=1336] Don't fall off.
[time=1337] Don't fade.
[time=1338] Don't stop.
[time=1339] Don't grow weary in doing good." I began to write a week ago just some things that came to my mind and I studied the scriptures and thought about your life as a mom.
[time=1350] What would be the things I would want to just encourage you this morning to not grow weary of doing?
[time=1356] And it was a long list as you could imagine.
[time=1360] So I've just tried to kind of trim it down to three things.
[time=1363] You say, "Why did you pick these three things?" You know what?
[time=1367] I pick these three things because I've watched many of you try and do these three things and I've watched many of you do them well.
[time=1373] I've watched my own wife give herself to these three things.
[time=1376] I've had experienced growing up my own mom giving herself to these three things and I've never met a wife, never met a mom yet who's done it perfectly.
[time=1386] I know all of you have failed at these things.
[time=1389] I understand that, but that's not what this is about.
[time=1392] This is about encouraging you.
[time=1394] This is about reminding you of what God has called you to be about as a mother.
[time=1401] And again, the list is long.
[time=1403] These are just three things that I hope this morning will encourage you.
[time=1407] You may feel convicted.
[time=1409] You may feel by the Spirit of God.
[time=1411] You may feel by the Word of God corrected or admonished.
[time=1415] That's fine.
[time=1416] It always happens to you and to me whenever we open this up.
[time=1419] [AMEN] But I want you to feel this morning a sense of hope and a sense of peace and a sense of thankfulness for what God has you as a mother in the midst of.
[time=1430] So let's jump in.
[time=1432] We're all weary of doing good.
[time=1435] Number one, in the way you invest in your kids spiritually.
[time=1440] In the way that you invest in your kids, young, adolescent, older doesn't matter.
[time=1445] There is an opportunity, I believe, God's given you as a mom to invest spiritually into the hearts and lives of your kids.
[time=1454] Now, we talk a lot about, we do.
[time=1457] I talk a lot about.
[time=1458] We hear it on the radio.
[time=1460] We see it in books.
[time=1462] Over the last 20 years, there has been an inordinate amount of discussion about the role of the Father in the spiritual leadership capacity in the home.
[time=1473] You with me?
[time=1474] We've heard a lot about that.
[time=1475] And I want to just say this morning as we should.
[time=1477] Guys, there is a clear.
[time=1479] Well, when we get to Father's Day, we'll come back and talk about the clear exhortation in Scripture to you and I as fathers and husbands to give spiritual leadership and investment and time to those hearts and lives that represent our family.
[time=1497] And while we can make a great case for there needing to be a renewed interest and a renewed and deepened commitment by fathers to give spiritual leadership as you look at the Scriptures' mothers, it is absolutely clear that you have not been in any way, shape or form excluded from that privileged position of spiritual investment in the hearts and lives of your kids.
[time=1522] Turn with me if you would.
[time=1524] Let me hear those pages turned to 2 Timothy.
[time=1527] Would you go back to 2 Timothy?
[time=1530] You'll pass 1 and 2 Thessalonians.
[time=1534] You'll come to 1 Timothy.
[time=1536] Go to 2 Timothy chapter 1, if you will.
[time=1540] And it says there in 2 Timothy 1, now Paul is writing this letter to Timothy.
[time=1547] Timothy is a godly, courageous young man who's pastoring the church at Ephesus.
[time=1554] And he's experiencing, as we've seen and as we've learned about Ephesus, Timothy's experiencing all kinds of challenges and struggles.
[time=1563] And so Paul writes to Timothy, 1 Timothy and 2 Timothy.
[time=1567] And as he writes Timothy, this godly young man who's pastoring leading an Ephesus, he reminds him of his spiritual heritage.
[time=1576] Look with me at 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 5.
[time=1580] He says, "For I, Paul, am mindful of the sincere faith within
[time=1587] you." Speaking to Timothy, "And moms in the room I'd like you just to make a note there." We'll come back to it.
[time=1593] Make a note there where it says sincere faith.
[time=1596] "For I am mindful," Paul says to Timothy, "of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother, Lois, and your mother, Eunice.
[time=1609] And I am sure that it is that sincere faith in you as well."
[time=1618] Here we see Lois and Eunice, grandmother and mother.
[time=1622] And while we know that it is impossible spiritually to literally transport a faith into a soul, we see the investment
[time=1632] that was made.
[time=1633] We see the influence that they had.
[time=1635] We see the kind of relationship they had with their grandson and their son.
[time=1642] And the kind of relationship that it was was a relationship whereby a sincere faith has been passed along.
[time=1651] And I asked you to kind of make a note there where it says sincere.
[time=1657] Because when you look up that word, what you find there is, I think it's a word used with great intention.
[time=1665] They passed along a real faith.
[time=1671] This mom and this grandmother passed along an authentic faith.
[time=1678] This mom and this grandmother, they passed along a faith that was real and honest.
[time=1686] And I want that to serve for you mothers today as a reminder and an encouragement that even though I know it's difficult at times to let us as husbands or even more importantly now this morning in our discussion, even as difficult it is for you to show it to your kids.
[time=1704] Even though sometimes you want to hide your brokenness and your struggle and your confusion and the dark days and the heart aches,
[time=1718] what you do when you live out your faith authentically and
[time=1724] sincerely in front of your kids.
[time=1726] And I understand you have to use wisdom.
[time=1728] I'm all about that.
[time=1729] But don't hide from them the reality of your life, the reality of your life that God Himself speaks into, that God Himself transforms, that God Himself changes.
[time=1743] Are you with me?
[time=1744] Live your faith in a way that is sincere.
[time=1747] Pass along to them, not some faith that's propped up in pretense, smiling, saying let's go to church gang, but live a faith
[time=1758] that's honest and pass along a faith that's real because when you pass along a sincere faith, Paul says I am sure that it is in you as well.
[time=1772] Go to chapter three if you would.
[time=1775] Second Timothy 3, 15.
[time=1777] Actually I want to start in verse 14.
[time=1779] If we can, Paul goes on in his encouragement to Timothy.
[time=1783] He says you, Timothy, however, you continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, very important words there.
[time=1792] Note those, underline those.
[time=1794] The things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them and that from where did He learn them and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads
[time=1812] to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
[time=1816] As difficult as it may be for some of us to wrap our arms around this, as challenging as I know it is, as a parent to do this, I want to remind you of what it says right there.
[time=1828] Look back at 14.
[time=1830] You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of.
[time=1837] And how were they convinced of these things?
[time=1840] Look at 15.
[time=1841] That from childhood, okay, childhood there means, I looked it up, means childhood.
[time=1851] It means young.
[time=1854] It means from the beginning.
[time=1857] It means from the earliest days.
[time=1860] You with me?
[time=1862] From the earliest days, what?
[time=1865] I don't think Paul or God has a problem with from the earliest days blocks from the earliest days toys.
[time=1873] I don't think he has a problem with from the earliest days Plato or I don't, but what he says here, this grandmother and mother did was from the earliest days they invested what?
[time=1889] The sacred writings that from childhood you have known not just
[time=1898] been familiar with, but know from the beginning from the earliest time this mom invested the holy scriptures into his heart and
[time=1908] life so that he knew them was familiar with at a deep and
[time=1914] intimate level, the sacred writings which were able to give him the wisdom that led to his salvation through faith, which was in Christ Jesus, which he learned about in the scriptures, which his mom invested into his heart and life.
[time=1930] That phrase I told you to underline where it says you have learned and become convinced of.
[time=1938] When you look that up in the original language, I want you to know this, it implies consistent prioritized repetition.
[time=1946] It implies consistent and prioritized repetition.
[time=1952] This mom, Eunice, in a consistent, prioritized and repetitive way made it an everyday part of her life to invest into this young boy, the sacred writings which were able to save his soul.
[time=1966] Moms, I know you have a lot going on.
[time=1970] I understand the pressures that you face. Do not grow weary of doing good in this way, in this
[time=1980] fashion, for these reasons.
[time=1984] Hang on to this, Moms.
[time=1988] Give yourself to a spiritual, godly, biblical, truthful investment that God will honor and grow and bring fruit to in the days to come. Don't grow weary of doing that. Secondly, don't grow weary of doing good in the way you edify your kids verbally.
[time=2008] We talked about this very thing just a few weeks ago, when we were back in Ephesians 4, would you turn back to Ephesians 4?
[time=2016] Go from 2 Timothy, just back a few pages.
[time=2020] Colossians, Philippians, you'll come eventually to Ephesians.
[time=2024] Go to Ephesians 4.29.
[time=2028] He says in Ephesians 4.29, and here he speaks to all of us.
[time=2032] He says, "Let no unwholesome word." Moms, I want you just to take this in the context of your life. I want you to take this in the context of both a quiet Saturday morning and a carpool ride home. I mean, go ahead and just allow the Word of God to speak to you in the many different circumstances you find yourself in where you find yourself, like I find myself responding verbally.
[time=2060] Here it says right here, 4.29, "Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification." We defined that word for you a few weeks ago.
[time=2072] A word that's edifying are words that are instructive, encouraging, and uplifting. "Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for instruction, encouragement, and uplifting." According to the need of the moment so that it, the words you speak will give grace, not condemnation to those who hear.
[time=2100] You know, it got me thinking about parents, and it got me thinking about the responsibilities of both fathers and mothers. And I just, I knew because of the study that we've been in, I knew because of the reading I've continued to do, and many of you have continued as well. I knew what was coming in Ephesians 6, and so I just found myself going there in recent days.
[time=2120] "Children obey your parents," chapter 6, verse 1.
[time=2124] "Obey your parents and the Lord," for this is right. "Honor your father and your mother," which is the first commandment with a promise, "so that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth." Then look at verse 4. "Fathers do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord." You know, as I read that, something kind of was running around in my mind. I couldn't remember where it was. I had heard this, or if in fact it was even applicable here, but I went ahead and just for fun went over to Colossians 3.
[time=2164] I thought, I thought in Colossians 3, maybe there was something that was similar, and there was in Colossians 3, 21.
[time=2172] Paul, writing to the Church of Colossae, says, "Fathers, exaggerate your children so that they will not lose heart." And there was just something about the father thing, and I know we're talking about mothers this morning, but that's why I was chewing on this. And sure enough, I kind of just dug around enough to remember that there are actually a couple words that could be used in the Greek for father.
[time=2196] And there was a Greek word that could have been used for father and was used many times in the scripture to mean significant, specific, only the male individual in this husband-wife relationship and this father-mother endeavor, there's a word in the Greek used for just father. And there's also a word in the Greek used for it's the word father, but in the Greek it means generally applied to both. Wherever you see that word, what's following is generally applied to both, and that's the word used in Ephesians 6-4.
[time=2232] That's the word used in Colossians 3-21.
[time=2236] So it's a great reminder for you as a mother, and we'll remind the guys of it, you know, in a month or so.
[time=2244] But I want to just tell you this morning, ladies, as it relates to your verbal interaction.
[time=2252] There's a lot of studies I could show you about how important it is, statistics I could show you that speak to the incredible importance of how you model certain things, how you act in certain situations, very important. I could show you other studies though that speak to the enormous significance of what you say.
[time=2272] And not just what you say as a mother, but how you say it, the weight that it carries, the impact that it brings. And so he says to fathers and mothers today, as it relates to the things you say, don't provoke your children, don't exasperate them, don't provoke them to anger and don't exasperate them to a place where they lose heart. Now, this is where it gets personal, and I'm glad that the word speaks to both fathers and mothers, because I just, I can just start here by just saying to you, I'm about to tell you what exasperating and provoking your kids looks like.
[time=2320] And it's just, it's just not real pretty.
[time=2324] And I just want you to know, I don't do very well at this sometimes. I do better at this than I used to. Thank God. I'm grateful for those who have helped me with this. As recently as yesterday, I had to apologize for this.
[time=2344] So I know all too well the reality of this very important biblical truth.
[time=2352] And whether you're a mom or whether you're a dad, I think this morning it's just important that we say it like it is, that we look at it honestly.
[time=2360] So that what gets passed along is sincere.
[time=2368] To exasperate, to provoke, and I'm condensing an immaterial, so bear with me. You know what it means?
[time=2376] It means too much.
[time=2380] It means too much corrective talking.
[time=2388] It means to bury them verbally with confrontation and/or criticism.
[time=2396] To bury them, to just absolutely load on them, whether in that moment or over time it represents a pattern of excess.
[time=2408] It means to bury them with corrective or critical voice raising.
[time=2416] I think that means yelling.
[time=2420] It means to bury them with an corrective ticked off arguing, ticked off arguing. There's arguing that goes on sometimes with a kid that's, there's arguing sometimes that goes on between a mother and a child. There's sometimes arguing that goes on and what's at stake here is the heart of the father, the heart of the mother. There's something at stake they're worried, they're scared, they're standing for what's right and in the midst of that conflict things escalate and I believe to a degree there is a sternness that can come when something's at stake that's right and true and you're trying to defend that. I think there's a little room there.
[time=2472] What this is talking about isn't so much a righteous indignation thing. It's just, and you and I both know we get there, we're just ticked. We're just angry.
[time=2484] We're fed up. We're frustrated.
[time=2488] We're at the end of our rope. We're going to choose not to go the self-control route. We're going to let it fly. And it's more about us and what we're mad about than it is about a genuine concern if that makes sense nod your head.
[time=2504] To exasperate, to provoke, to bury them verbally, confrontation or criticism. It's an inordinate amount of arguing. Watch this. It's the inordinate amount of arguing and corrective speech that leaves them exasperated, irritated, frustrated, leaves them rolling their eyes at you.
[time=2528] Raise your hand if you've seen an eye rolled at you.
[time=2532] It not only leaves them rolling their eyes, it leaves them not even looking at you. Because you know why?
[time=2540] Because they're tired. You've worn them out.
[time=2548] And their eyes roll and their eyes go elsewhere. And kids, guess what?
[time=2552] Kids, listen. Kids, you shouldn't roll your eyes.
[time=2556] You shouldn't not look at me.
[time=2560] You should keep your eyes on me and not roll them and be respectful and look at me. That's what you should do.
[time=2568] And I'm going to say to you kids, and I'm going to say to you parents what I said to husbands and wives over the last two weeks.
[time=2576] Kids, God says we just read it. Honor your mother and your father.
[time=2580] Don't roll your eyes. Look at them respectfully.
[time=2584] You lead them into temptation when you exasperate them. And when you provoke them.
[time=2595] Too much debate.
[time=2599] Too much reasoning. Especially at an early age.
[time=2603] I see this. Too much debate. Too much reasoning.
[time=2607] Too much shame. Too much scolding. Too much reminding.
[time=2611] Again and again and again and not enough what the Scripture just told you in 6-4, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
[time=2629] And again, while we're just shooting straight, I think we all understand that most of the exasperation circumstances, usually those happen late. We usually don't start out exasperated, do we? We usually don't start out provoking them. No, we get to these exasperating your kids and provoking your kids to anger. We get to those down the road and we get down the road when what we should have done from the beginning is instruct them and discipline them.
[time=2661] Soon, quick, early, lovingly, but firmly.
[time=2669] And you say, well, I don't want to discipline my kid.
[time=2673] I don't want to do that. I think it's too harsh. I think it's mean.
[time=2679] I understand that. Proverbs 13 says it really clear. And again, I don't think he's just talking.
[time=2687] He who withholds his rod hates his son, but he loves and disciplines him diligently.
[time=2695] And if from the very beginning, and I'm, and there are a lot of you in the room who aren't at the beginning, so I'm not pouring, you know, hot coals on you here. I'm just, for the big picture, when from the beginning we establish patterns of loving discipline and loving correction.
[time=2711] When from the beginning we're unis and lousing these kids and investing truth in them, helping them understand and then calling them to that and addressing that when, celebrating that when it's achieved and disciplining that when it's not, when that goes on patterns are established, not that lead to perfection, but that lead to a relationship that has a foundation that's able to work in a way that's healthier than what so oftentimes happens when we neglect the very thing that God said to bring, which was instruction and discipline.
[time=2747] Lovingly instruct them with the truth.
[time=2751] Lovingly discipline them when they fall short.
[time=2755] Don't scold. Don't shame.
[time=2759] Don't argue. Don't raise voices. Don't throw things.
[time=2763] Don't throw fits. Deal with it.
[time=2767] Lovingly, quickly, honestly.
[time=2771] Moms, I've seen so many of you in this room work so hard at that. Do not grow weary of doing good in the way you edify, build up, strengthen, encourage your kids verbally.
[time=2787] Lastly, moms, don't grow weary of doing good in the way that you model Christ following and not world loving. This is big.
[time=2799] So big today. And again, I see so many of you working so hard at this, but I know all of you need encouragement.
[time=2807] Don't grow weary moms of doing good in the way that you model for your children Christ following and not world loving.
[time=2819] You know, dads may have in some way, I always hope that this is done well. I always hope this is done with grace and sensitivity. And what I mean is dads may have the final...a husband might have the final say, if you will. I hope he handles that with grace, and I hope there's a mutual sense of respect and submission that we talked about early on in Ephesians 5. And while dads may have some kind of final say, "Mom, I believe with all my heart that God has given you as a woman, as a mother, and as a wife," the unique capacity to establish what I'll call the "what we value in this home" mindset.
[time=2863] As it comes to the way you handle yourselves with your possessions, the way you handle yourselves with your desires, the way you handle yourselves with your purchases, the way you handle yourselves with how you look and where you go and what you're about, I think God has given you as a wife and as a mom, a unique capacity to influence and establish the what we will value in this home mindset.
[time=2891] Look with me at Luke 14. Here we see Jesus himself painting the picture of what Christ followers should value.
[time=2903] And moms, I just want you to be encouraged by this. It's aggressive, it's true, I think it's right. Sometimes it's hard for me to even read it, but I think it's good for you to be reminded of this, good for all of us to be reminded of this this morning, Luke 14, 25. Now large crowds were going along with him and he turned and said to them here's a classic Jesus shrinking his crowd dialogue. He had a way of shrinking the crowd.
[time=2935] He turns to all of them, this huge crowd and says hey, if anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.
[time=2951] If you want to come follow me, if you want to be a disciple of mine, if you want to follow the ways of Jesus, he says you got to hate all those people. And 27 whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple. Cross the symbol of shame and pain and suffering. So unless you want to just publicly carry your symbol of pain and suffering and being misunderstood and mistreated the cross, and unless you're going to hate your family, don't even think about following me.
[time=2995] Now when you study that you come to realize he wasn't saying hate your wife, hate her, he wasn't saying hate your kids, he was saying listen, he was saying your love for him and your devotion to him must be primary, must be over and above the love you have for anyone. That is when and only then true following and true devotion occur. For which one of you when he wants to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it.
[time=3031] Otherwise when he has laid a foundation and is able to, is not able to finish it all who observe it begin to ridicule him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish. You calculate the cost.
[time=3043] Or what king when he sets out to meet another king in battle will not first sit down and consider whether he is strong enough with 10,000 men to encounter the one coming against him with 20,000 or else while the other is still far away having calculated the cost he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.
[time=3063] So then none of you can be my disciple who does not give up all his own possessions and he wasn't speaking figuratively he was speaking literally give up.
[time=3079] Have nothing that would in any way be valued more than your king.
[time=3091] And moms I think you have this unique capacity to influence that kind of living and that kind of mindset. In the hearts and lives of your kids and in the hearts and lives of your husband even as well.
[time=3111] Moms you have the privilege of investing into the hearts and lives of your kids the great truth of Mark 836, many of you know it. Too many kids today don't know it. And you as a mother have the privilege of investing and depositing into them that says there in Mark 836 for what does it profit a man?
[time=3135] Really? To gain the whole world and forfeit his what? His soul.
[time=3143] You get the chance as a mother to help them understand and you get to help them understand that by the way you spend you get to help them understand that by the way you save you get to help them understand that by the way you and your husband together plan you get to help a kid understand the great truth of that as they watch you value certain things and let other things go and believe me they don't have to look at your checkbook to know what you value they know they know because they live with you they know because they hear you talk they know because they watch you and you get the privilege of investing in them mothers a life that is about your king a life that is about following him a life that is about ministry and kindness and grace and compassion and service a life that's about others and not about yourself and as you live that life out as you model that life for them they are the recipients of a sincere faith and they become convinced as it says there in 2 Timothy of what it is you stood for and what it is you were about so God bless you in your efforts to continue along these roads don't grow weary of doing good and as we close let me just if I could as your pastor and friend and as one who respects you greatly would you just stand the rest of you just stay seated but all moms in the room would you stand and with your heads bowed and your eyes closed mothers this morning can I just say to you before we pray for you can I just say that I know many of you and I understand like I said before the road that you travel I know how oftentimes these efforts toward all that is true and right and good the things God's called you to as a mom the stuff we've talked about this morning I know there are times where in the midst of your efforts you've grown very weary you're tired and you're hurting and there may be many of you this morning and while you would with me agree with God about these principles in all honesty and sincerity you may stand this morning saying I am a thousand miles away it feels like Kelly from being this mom that God's word calls me to be I know there are some of you in the room you're experiencing seasons of victory and ground gained on these fronts and we celebrate that but I want to just read to you all of you and especially to those of you who this morning in all honesty would say you know what I am weary and I am tired and I am discouraged I want to encourage you with what Jesus said in Matthew 1128 says in Matthew 1128 come to me all who are what weary so if you're tired this morning if you're discouraged this morning if you're weary this morning on the mothering front let me just pray for you today father grateful for what your word has shown us today thankful for the reminders that it's brought oh God there stands before you this morning mothers so many of whom have hearts that want to honor you and desire God to be used of you in the lives of those in their home and yet they're discouraged by their sin they're discouraged by their failure they're disappointed God at the lack of progress they feel guilty coming to you again and again and again with the same prayers of confession and forgiveness and God I pray that you would again this morning lift them up I pray that you would grant them a clarity in their vision from what you've called them to God I pray that you would give them a courage in their heart to walk forward with great trust in you God I pray that their husbands and their friends and their moms and their accountability people whoever that might be God that we would walk with them in ways that thank them for their efforts that pray for them on a regular basis God that we would offer to them anything and everything that we could to lighten their load and encourage their heart God I pray today that they would feel honored I pray today that they would sense and know how special they are to you and how valued they are by those that they love and serve may you bring us back together again soon father in the days to come if that be your will and in the days in between help us to know what it means to as fathers and mothers as followers of Christ God help us to know what it means to love you deeply to trust you in a meaningful way to obey you radically continue God please to grow us in our faith thank you for our moms today we give them to you and we thank you for the blessing that they are from your son's name we pray amen.
