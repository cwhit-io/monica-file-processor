[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It's great to be with you as always.
[time=36] And I hope that as you've been watching in recent days that our study in Ephesians has encouraged you like it has me, you know, the letters and the emails and the notes that I and our team have received from so many of you would indicate that God is, in fact, doing a great thing in your heart and life.
[time=54] For us, it's been a privilege to bring to you this amazing truth from Ephesians.
[time=60] Our study in Ephesians five in recent weeks, I think has been some of the most meaningful teaching.
[time=68] I think I've been able to bring to this family in years the response has been absolutely overwhelming.
[time=75] And as we head into Ephesians six and some very important truth for you and I in this day, I hope you'll continue to watch and be encouraged.
[time=85] Yeah, I wanna just remind you, those of you in our viewing audience, many of you right here in the Fort Wayne area, Blackhawk Ministries has a number of significant ministries that God has given us the privilege of being a part of.
[time=98] There probably hasn't been a ministry more significant or longstanding than the unbelievable privilege God has given us to be a part of Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=110] Blackhawk Christian School has been around for years and years.
[time=113] And as they continue to move forward in a commitment that we have to educate and disciple, I want you to know that this may be the time for you to think about your grandkids or your kids or some friends kids as we come to an end of a school year and we see already in the distance, the beginning of a new school year in August of 2010.
[time=137] I wanna invite you to go to our website.
[time=139] I wanna invite you to call the school, the school website and phone number information is here at the bottom of the screen for you.
[time=146] I would love for you to come by and take a tour of our facility.
[time=150] It is an amazing team of people that God has put together, giving leadership to our school.
[time=154] And as we try to educate and prepare kids for a future, a unique future that we believe God has designed for them, it brings great joy to us.
[time=164] And not only do we find great joy in working with these kids and students between preschool all the way up to high school, but we find great joy in working with their families as well.
[time=175] So think about it, give it some thought and give us a call.
[time=179] We'd love to introduce you to the life-changing opportunity of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=184] God bless you, hope you have a great week and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=188] - This morning I wanna introduce you to two folks.
[time=190] I'm gonna ask Nicole if she'd come in first.
[time=193] Nicole Sleezmann's here, come on in Nicole and she actually has been a part of our church for a little while and good morning.
[time=206] And her friend Kurt, there we go.
[time=210] And she's gonna share her story with you and tell you what God's been doing in her life.
[time=217] And again, she's nervous and you all know she shouldn't be.
[time=222] And so pray for her and encourage her and when she's done reading this, I know we can celebrate what God's done.
[time=231] So go ahead, read your story, Nicole.
[time=232] - Okay, hi, my name is Nicole Sleezmann.
[time=236] I'm the mother of a beautiful little girl, the youngest of nine kids, my biggest heroes in life are my mom and my dad.
[time=245] My mom has been my best friend since I was a little girl.
[time=251] Growing up I attended a few different churches as well as some Bible studies.
[time=257] But eventually I gave up ongoing.
[time=259] I was too lost to understand the importance of building a relationship with God and having him in my life.
[time=265] Friends and family members tried reaching out to me and tried to help me open my eyes, but all I did was ignore them every time.
[time=273] I used to think, what does it matter if I know God or go to church?
[time=276] Would it really make a difference?
[time=279] All that mattered to me at that point in my life was hanging out with friends and having fun.
[time=283] I thought I was untouchable and that as long as I had my parents, I would be just fine.
[time=288] However, that all changed two years ago when I was hit with some life-changing news.
[time=294] On September 4th of 2008, the day of my birthday of old days, my mother received a call to come into the doctor's office for some test results she had been waiting for.
[time=306] Her and I both went together and we were hit with the unexpected.
[time=311] She was diagnosed with stage three lung cancer and then a week or so later found out that she had an aggressive form of bladder cancer.
[time=321] My heart sank so deep in my chest I felt like my world was crashing.
[time=326] My mother and I both broke down for a bit and after a while we began to talk about God and heaven and eternal life.
[time=332] It was then that I realized how selfish I had been towards God pushing him out of my life and I questioned what to do.
[time=341] I remember going home that night and breaking down and I also remember to talk that I had with Phil's mom, Terry, who said, "Allow yourself to open up to God and he will give you the answers and help your pain." I closed my eyes and began to open up during my prayer to God.
[time=359] When I finished up, I had this overwhelming feeling like no matter what happened, it'll be all right.
[time=365] It's been two years since my mother was diagnosed with cancer and although there have been some ins and outs in the hospital, my mother is doing good.
[time=375] Her cancer is currently stable.
[time=377] I know that God heard my prayers and continues to listen no matter how busy he is.
[time=382] I feel truly blessed because of the second chance that I have been given for the extra time I have been given with my mother and because God has truly blessed me with some very special people to help me through this all.
[time=396] I'm here today to give my life, my heart and soul to Christ.
[time=400] I'm here to give my thanks and show my appreciation for being here and for never giving up on me.
[time=408] I have learned that no matter how hard it is, how hard it gets, he will always be here for me.
[time=416] I'd like to say thanks, the Black Hawk, for giving me this opportunity and helping me as well as many others out there to see exactly what I, as well as them, have been missing.
[time=429] Thanks.
[time=431] (audience applauds) - Wait, hang on one second.
[time=442] I'm so grateful for the story you just heard.
[time=446] I know Phil and Nicole have been coming for a little while.
[time=452] They live in Bryan, Bryan, Ohio.
[time=456] Feel like I should pay a mileage or something.
[time=458] They come all the time.
[time=461] I think a baptized Phil's dad a couple of months ago.
[time=464] And it's so encouraging, you guys, to see this family and what God's doing and you reach out to not only this immediate community, but even this region.
[time=476] And so grateful for you and so thankful for your story and thankful for the relationship God's given you guys and thankful for how it's growing you and your faith and your love for him.
[time=488] And Nicole, if you'll hang on here, is your pastor and friend this morning in light of your profession of faith and your commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=496] It's an honor to baptize you this morning in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=502] (audience applauds) Good job.
[time=510] (audience applauds) - Thanks you guys, Bill, come on in.
[time=520] Some of you know Bill, Kester Key, others of you may not, but I'm thankful of Noam Bill for a number of years and I had just a brief chat back in the back this morning and he just shared that this is something he's been thinking about for a while, which is often the way it goes.
[time=535] And as he's thought about it, God's led him to this point and I want Bill just to share with you his story and then we'll baptize him.
[time=541] - Okay, my name is Bill Kester Key and I am the last of 12 children and the Father of three beautiful daughters, Trinity age 15 and Karen age 13, whom some of you know, in Rachel age three.
[time=555] I love sports, playing and watching, reading and learning, traveling, which I saw them do, engulfing and fishing, which I do even less than I travel.
[time=565] For the last seven years, I've owned an exterior remodeling company here in Fort Wayne.
[time=569] I was raised in a Roman Catholic family that was like most other families I know, dysfunctional.
[time=575] The larger number of children my family just exposed me to more dysfunction.
[time=580] And although I loved God as a child and was taught about Jesus Christ at church and school, there was still a disconnect in my life because while I knew about God and what he had done for me, and even though I was religious and went to church every Sunday, I still did not know him or his power in my life.
[time=598] As I grew older, the devil used the world to tunt my flesh.
[time=602] And I was only too happy to oblige the temptations and I let it sin for life.
[time=608] My sin grew worse as I grew older and I became more separated from God as my conscience became more and more seared.
[time=615] Sin had me in its grip and it eventually led me into a severe depression that lasted approximately two years.
[time=623] I despaired for my life during this time and thought that I was worthless and ruined.
[time=628] God brought me through this depression and I felt that he had saved me through it.
[time=634] After coming through the depression, I remember a still small voice reassuring me that during my time of trial that God had helped me save in the palm of his hand.
[time=645] But I still wasn't saved because I still didn't understand what it meant to be saved.
[time=650] I was extremely grateful to God for saving me as I understood it and wanted to get to know him better.
[time=657] I started attending church on a daily basis, listening to Christian radio, reading my Bible and meeting new Christian friends.
[time=665] In 1997, I attended my first promise keeper's rally as God continued to reveal himself to me.
[time=672] Sometimes I would say the sinner's prayer at the end of a radio broadcast or at the end of a rally, but still wasn't completely sure of my salvation.
[time=682] In August of 1998, I knelt down in my shower and confessed my sins to Christ, asked for his forgiveness and with Romans 10, nine and 10 as a text, claimed Christ as my savior and risen Lord.
[time=695] To me on that day, I finally knew, and I knew that I knew that I was saved.
[time=699] I might've been saved before that, I am not exactly sure, but that day I made my calling an election sure.
[time=707] Sometimes we hear salvation stories and sometimes they sound so miraculous, wonderful and neat that we believe the person telling the story does a complete 180 with his life as soon as he is saved.
[time=720] And although I think that sometimes the salvation experience does come to a person in such a way, that has not been the case with me.
[time=727] Since being saved, Christ has literally given me a whole new life, changed my entire worldview, resurrected my conscience, given me meaning and direction, abundant blessings, and a new heart.
[time=741] Yet I have still struggled with sin.
[time=743] I relate to Paul when he refers to himself as the chief of sinners.
[time=747] And to his admission that the good I would, I do not, and the evil I would not, that I do.
[time=754] I also rejoice with him when he says that it is Christ who delivers him from his body of death.
[time=760] And so it is Christ who has delivered me from my body of death and to that I say amen and hallelujah.
[time=766] I am choosing to be baptized today not because I feel it is necessary in order for me to be saved, but in order to make sure that I am being fully obedient and submissive to God as I can possibly be, as well as fully submitting to the leadership of the church, Christ owned body.
[time=784] (audience applauds)
[time=792] - That's encouraging, so many things there.
[time=797] I know you listened and I know God will use Bill's story
[time=804] to encourage many of you in the ongoing opportunity.
[time=809] God gives you to walk with his son.
[time=812] Bill, thanks for your honesty.
[time=815] And please know how thankful we are to have you as part of this family.
[time=820] Thank you for sharing this morning.
[time=821] So clearly your love and commitment to our Lord.
[time=824] And because of that, it's a privilege.
[time=826] As a friend and pastor to baptize you this morning in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=832] (audience applauds) Praise God for everything we just heard and sang.
[time=846] [AMEN] (audience applauds) [AMEN] (audience applauds) - Well, hey, what a journey it's been.
[time=855] These last several months as we have been making our way through the book of Ephesians.
[time=859] We've entitled our series, The Truth, The Way, and the Life.
[time=864] We looked in chapters one, two, and three at the truth about our salvation.
[time=868] I know that's a distant memory in some respects, but what a blessing God gave us as he gave us those weeks, looking at the great truth about what God has done as he has saved and redeemed us and made us new in Christ.
[time=883] Having been saved and redeemed and made new in Christ, we learned in chapters four, five, and now six that there is a way in which we are to live.
[time=895] There are specifics that God has designed for us when it comes to living out the truth of our faith.
[time=902] And that truth, coupled with that way, leads to a life.
[time=908] It leads to the life God designed you and I to have and what a joy that is and what a joy it's been to discover that together with you.
[time=916] We come to this morning to the last chapter in our study of Ephesians.
[time=921] And while the previous chapter and the almost special little mini series within a series that we gave ourselves to in chapter five and the great relevance of that chapter and its issues struck us and encouraged us, I gotta tell you, what we see here at the beginning of chapter six is just as relevant.
[time=943] It's just as powerful.
[time=945] It is just as much for you and I in the midst of this world that we live in, the culture that we are doing our best with his help to navigate, the truths that we come to this morning so very important.
[time=959] So let's get to those that this morning as we come to Ephesians chapter six.
[time=964] Before I read this to you, I will say this.
[time=966] I've entitled the message at least at the top of my notes.
[time=968] I have more submission, more submission.
[time=973] What we have seen for a number of weeks really going back
[time=979] to the middle of chapter five is that in God's economy, my friends, in God's plan, if you were to now look at how it is he has taught us the truths and the principles that he has revealed to us.
[time=993] Whether it's the mutual respect and submission between husbands and wives, the respect of a wife toward her husband, the submission of the husband toward her wife in his willingness to serve.
[time=1006] Now we come to the relationship between children and parents and we see it again.
[time=1012] We'll move on this morning, I hope, to the relationship between employees and employers and we'll see it again, again and again and again.
[time=1021] The biblical principle that God uses to mark and characterize our relationships is you before me.
[time=1030] You first, how can I serve you?
[time=1037] How can I minister to you?
[time=1039] How can I in this interaction?
[time=1041] How can I in this relationship?
[time=1043] How can I posture myself in such a way so that you are honored, so that you are lifted up and not me?
[time=1052] Because this, we learn as we look at this, this isn't about me, this is about you and how I can lift you up, serve honor and submit to you.
[time=1066] So this morning we come in Ephesians six to yes, more submission.
[time=1072] Will you stand as I read God's word in honor of God's word?
[time=1077] Let me read this to you as you stand.
[time=1079] Ephesians chapter six, verses one through nine.
[time=1083] It says children obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
[time=1088] Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise so that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth.
[time=1098] Fathers do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
[time=1106] Slaves be obedient to those who are your masters, according to the flesh, with fear and trembling in the sincerity of your heart as to Christ, not by way of eye service as men pleasers, but as slaves of Christ doing the will of God from the heart with good will render service as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord whether slave or free and masters, employers, do the same things to them and give up threatening,
[time=1146] knowing that both their master and yours is in heaven and there is no partiality with him.
[time=1155] Let me pray for us this morning.
[time=1156] Father in heaven, we stand as we often do in this room in anticipation and gratitude.
[time=1165] God, we anticipate what the spirit of God and the word of God can only do.
[time=1170] We anticipate you taking these truths, God, and convicting us and reminding us and instructing us and teaching us things we've never seen, reminding us of things that we've possibly forgotten.
[time=1185] God even bringing us face to face with those things that we have rebelled from.
[time=1190] Father, we stand this morning in anticipation of what can happen in a body of believers who submit themselves to the great truth of your word.
[time=1201] And Father, we stand this morning grateful, grateful for what that can mean in the lives of our children, in the lives of our families.
[time=1212] God in the midst of our homes and in the midst of this church, God, is we hear more about submission as we learn more about what that looks like.
[time=1222] God, as we take these truths and attempt to, with your help, live them out.
[time=1226] God, we're so grateful for where that can lead.
[time=1231] What that can mean in our lives and the lives of those we love.
[time=1235] God, give us strength and courage, please, to face these things and to face them well.
[time=1239] We love you.
[time=1240] We look forward to what you'll do and all the people in the room agreed and said, "Amen, you can be seated." Well, let's jump right in.
[time=1252] Shall we, Ephesians 6, verse one?
[time=1254] And it says they're children and we'll stop right there.
[time=1256] Children, Ephesians 6, one, obey your parents.
[time=1260] We begin this morning by talking to those in the room and those of you who may be watching via the broadcast you may be listening online.
[time=1270] This first verse in Ephesians chapter six has specifically to do with those children who still live in relationship physically, they're of an age where they still find themselves under the roof, if you will, of their mother and father or either.
[time=1288] They still are of an age whereby they live in submission to them.
[time=1293] Their mother and father are responsible for them.
[time=1296] This is for all of you younger men and women in the room, boys and girls who live with your mom and dad and who are of an age where you still are under their authority, reliant upon their support.
[time=1309] And it says to you, obey your parents.
[time=1315] Children, obey your parents in the Lord.
[time=1323] Obey your parents, not in the strength that you can muster.
[time=1327] Obey your parents, not in the logic that you can derive.
[time=1331] Obey your parents, it says, in the Lord.
[time=1334] The whole book has given us such insight into the great privilege that you and I have as believers of being in Christ.
[time=1344] And it is in Christ, young men and women, boys and girls.
[time=1349] It's in a relationship with him that you find the strength and you find the capacity and you find the desire to obey mom and dad.
[time=1361] It says children, obey your parents.
[time=1364] In the notes you can write this down.
[time=1365] Children submit externally to parents.
[time=1370] Here we're talking about the external component of the relationship between a child and his mother and father.
[time=1379] And this external component is best described by the word of the principle of obedience when somebody after first hour asked me to define obedience.
[time=1390] And I've really quick tried to come up with something profound, but you know me, I just said it's when you do what they say.
[time=1399] How's that?
[time=1402] It's when you're asked to do something.
[time=1406] It's when you're given a task.
[time=1407] It's when you're told to be home at a certain time.
[time=1410] It's everything from the immediate of how you're treating a little sister in the midst of an argument to how clean the room's gonna be by, what time it's doing, complying, coming under the authority.
[time=1424] It's obeying and doing what they ask you to do.
[time=1429] External submission.
[time=1432] And I wanna say this before we move forward and I wanna say this to parents.
[time=1435] As right as it is for me to stand here and say to your children that God's designed for them is that they would obey you.
[time=1446] I think it's equally important and extremely necessary in light of the culture we live in today to remind you that while God has asked them to obey you, I believe in implied in that and clearly really stated in that and throughout scripture is that you would as a parent require it.
[time=1465] And that's not going so well in some situations.
[time=1474] It doesn't go so well all the time in my situation.
[time=1479] If God asks them, if God commands them to obey you, then you help the situation and you nurture that in them when you as a parent require that from them.
[time=1493] How are they going to learn to obey you if you don't require that they do?
[time=1499] When we were young and just starting out
[time=1505] on the parenting journey, I'm so thankful for friends, godly friends who came along and invested in Deborah and I, so many things I could share with you.
[time=1513] Maybe someday I'll get the chance to, but one thing I wanna share with you this morning on this front is just a simple little threefold thing I've shared, I think I've shared it with you before over the years, but I find it incredibly relevant to this discussion, so let me just share this with you as parents, just three truths about obedience.
[time=1535] But I think our God honoring, I believe with all my heart, they are scriptural and more than anything I see Jesus who I'm trying to, and you're trying to model our lives after him, we see Jesus giving himself to these three principles.
[time=1552] God honoring obedience, I don't know that at the slide or I don't think it'll come on the screen, you might wanna just write this down in your notesheet.
[time=1558] God honoring, parent honoring obedience, there you go, godly obedience is, number one, write this down, immediate.
[time=1568] When, think about it, when God asks you to do something,
[time=1575] when God asks me to do something, when God says to me, Kelly, love your wife the way Christ loved the church, I don't say to him, hey, great idea, let me think about that, I'll get back to you.
[time=1589] When God says to honor the authorities in my life and render to Caesar, what is Caesar's, when it comes to April 15th, I don't say, you know what, let me think about that.
[time=1600] When God commands us to do things, when it's God and you and me, when He commands us to do things, what's required and what's expected is that we would do it and do it now.
[time=1614] Godly obedience is immediate and we do such a disservice
[time=1621] to little hearts and lives and growing hearts and lives
[time=1628] and adolescent hearts and lives when we run around threatening them and repeating it to them and getting angrier and angrier with them instead of just drawing lines and building into them
[time=1647] the expectation that when they're asked to do something, anything, the godly response is to do it then.
[time=1654] Amen?
[time=1657] Godly obedience is now and it's that way for you and me and it should be that way for them and we help them, we bless them, we prepare them for a future of quick obedience which will save them
[time=1674] in a number of cases from the things that we wouldn't want for them.
[time=1681] Secondly, not only is Godly obedience immediate, it is thorough.
[time=1685] Christ didn't, in response to God's command to go and give his life, Christ didn't sort of sacrifice himself.
[time=1695] Did he?
[time=1698] Christ didn't sort of, Christ didn't kind of, Christ didn't do half the job, did he?
[time=1706] And this is poignant stuff and we're talking about the cross, it gets a little comical and we're thinking about cleaning a room, but the principle is the same.
[time=1716] Children, when you're asked to do something, when mom or dad requires you to engage in this task or fulfill this responsibility, what we have to help you understand is that God honoring obedience is thorough.
[time=1731] The room gets completely cleaned.
[time=1735] The dishes get completely done.
[time=1738] The teeth get completely brushed.
[time=1743] We've been dealing with a rash of 22nd teeth brushing lately in our home, I don't know how that works in your place.
[time=1749] You with me?
[time=1753] Godly obedience does the whole job.
[time=1758] And it does the whole job immediately and thirdly, it does the whole job immediately and thirdly without complaint.
[time=1767] All right, moms and dads, everybody at once.
[time=1774] [AMEN] No complaining, it's not the end of the world.
[time=1782] It is a good idea.
[time=1784] We aren't stupid, we really know what we're talking about and you know what truth is, we may be having a bad day and it could be a dumb idea, but he's your dad and she's your mom and remember, just like with husbands,
[time=1803] just like with wives, though externally here in the context just I'm dealing with him or her, I'm really obeying my parents in the Lord.
[time=1815] Does that make sense?
[time=1817] So children, obey your parents.
[time=1820] Mom and dad, make it easy.
[time=1823] We talked about how wives can make it easy for husbands to love them like Christ loved the church.
[time=1828] We talked about how we can make it easy for a wife to submit to her husband, guys, by living with her in an understanding way.
[time=1836] Parents, you can actually foster an attitude of obedience by from the very beginning requiring it
[time=1847] and having consequences for when it doesn't happen and having celebrations for when it does.
[time=1858] Children submit externally, obey your parents.
[time=1863] Children submit internally, let's go to verses two and three,
[time=1870] children submit internally, honor, external obedience, internal honor.
[time=1877] God covers it all right here in three verses.
[time=1880] Children submit internally to your parents.
[time=1884] It says in verse two, honor your father and mother, honor them, which is the first commandment where the promise so that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth.
[time=1897] Now, four-year-olds and five-year-olds and six-year-olds and eight, nine, 10, 13, 14, 16-year-olds, yeah, you're all still included in this command, but now we even move beyond those under the roof to those who simply have mothers and fathers, including me and many of you adults in the room, we have the chance here to, no matter how old we are, no matter where they are, no matter what they may or may not believe, except for issues where they might invite you to violate God's word.
[time=1932] Other than that, God's word says to honor them,
[time=1939] to respect them, to leave them feeling encouraged and thought of and respected, and it's not a real nebulous thing.
[time=1952] You all know what I'm talking about.
[time=1954] There are ways that we can interact with them.
[time=1957] There are ways that we can respond to them.
[time=1960] There are things that we can invite them to.
[time=1965] There is a way that we can live in relationship with moms and dads, all their flaws and failures, all their gifts and strengths, and leave them feeling honored.
[time=1975] I was trying to put it towards this week.
[time=1980] Many of you in the room could probably do a much better job at that than I, but we're dealing, we're at the very beginning of this with an 18-year-old who's now beginning that transition from really being under our roof and in our immediate care to a chapter of his life where he won't be.
[time=2002] I wish some of you would have prepared me for this.
[time=2006] It's been an interesting couple of months.
[time=2008] Some of you have been through this so you know what it's like.
[time=2009] It was really odd about three, four months ago.
[time=2011] He began to respectfully, I'll give him credit.
[time=2014] He began to kind of walk that tenuous line between you've been there.
[time=2019] Maybe you know what it was like.
[time=2020] Where all of a sudden he's kind of nicely telling you what he's about to go do.
[time=2027] He's not really asking you, does that make sense?
[time=2030] And he's a good kid.
[time=2033] And again, I think he's doing that well, but there is certainly a shift.
[time=2038] He is certainly at a point now where he's beginning to come out from under to a degree.
[time=2045] And yet I think he's trying to do that in a way that honors and I was thinking about how I feel when he does that with me.
[time=2053] And the way I feel is I just wrote it down.
[time=2057] The way I feel is I watch him comply and fall in line with whatever the request might be.
[time=2064] I know it may not be his first choice.
[time=2067] I know it may not be his second choice, but he does it in a way whereby if one of his friends would say to him on the way, driving away from the interaction with me, if you follow me, he's driving away, one of his friends might just hypothetically say, well, what's his problem?
[time=2087] He would defend me.
[time=2089] Does that make sense?
[time=2091] He may not agree with me, but I'm his dad.
[time=2097] And so there's this thing in him and there's this thing in your kids and you see it with sons and daughters who honor.
[time=2104] It doesn't mean we always agree, but there's a sense where I'm almost just gonna act like it's good and I'll do that genuinely.
[time=2111] And that's what happens.
[time=2114] See, that's what happens when we get to a place with our kids, not that it's been done perfectly, not that there hasn't been tragic mistakes that have been made, but as they grow to this place, they begin to honor and I wanna just share with you just briefly, somebody gave this to us years ago, I've shared this with you over the years, it's been a while, but I wanna just show you just real briefly, I think how God has designed it for us to get to this place where older kids transitioning to the next stage of life can really do what it says in our text this morning.
[time=2153] They can honor in a deep and meaningful, relational way, their mom and dad.
[time=2158] Look on the screen, you'll see there what we just entitled the parent child funnel.
[time=2162] If you'll notice at the bottom of this funnel, it's kinda tight, it's kinda small, you'll notice at the top of the funnel, it's how funnels work, it's bigger and it's broader.
[time=2171] Watch how God does this.
[time=2175] At the beginning, at the bottom of it, I'll just put zero to 12 years of age.
[time=2181] And I wanna just remind you of the opportunity God has given you as a parent, maybe even as a grandparent to engage in what I'll just call some years of control immediately when you see the word control, immediately when some of you hear the word control, it has kind of a negative connotation.
[time=2203] But what I wanna try to help you understand this morning is what a privilege God has given you with biblical principles and a godly love in your heart to come alongside and lead.
[time=2215] I'm talking about leadership here, I'm talking about, well here's what I'm talking about, let's just stay it this way.
[time=2221] From zero to 12, someone's going to be, what, in control.
[time=2226] Who's it gonna be?
[time=2233] Somebody in that home, in that relationship,
[time=2239] is going to be in control.
[time=2242] They're going to be leading.
[time=2244] They're going to be setting the agenda.
[time=2247] They're going to be deciding.
[time=2249] They're going to be affecting schedule.
[time=2251] And I hear some folks who say, "I hate the word, I want freedom." I want my kid to have freedom.
[time=2259] I want your kid to have freedom.
[time=2264] Zero to 12 probably isn't the best stage of life for them to be experiencing freedom.
[time=2271] They're sinful, sin sick, shriveled up little hearts, can't handle the freedom, and it's going to get ugly.
[time=2281] And God gives us his parents the chance to hear me lovingly
[time=2288] with real purpose, graciously yet with real strength,
[time=2294] provide that sweet little sin sick, shriveled up soul, the spiritual, parental, loving control.
[time=2303] These years are right now, whatever you want here.
[time=2306] These years are characterized by you, establishing God-honoring routines, God-honoring standards, God-honoring expectations.
[time=2316] These years, zero to 12 years of age, are years where you as a parent and me as a parent are absolutely and utterly devoted to rolling up our sleeves and instructing Ephesians 6-4, bringing them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
[time=2333] And between zero and 12, we are instructing and disciplining, instructing and disciplining, instructing and disciplining, loving and caring and coming alongside and trying it again and instructing and disciplining.
[time=2346] It's a lot of hard work, takes an enormous effort
[time=2352] and requires great sacrifice, which is why so many don't.
[time=2360] Years of instruction and discipline, prayers and genuine efforts, you establishing for them bedtimes, study habits, polite and respectful interaction with adults,
[time=2379] self-control, hard work, purity, obedience, kindness, service towards others.
[time=2389] One of the saddest, most painful experiences that I have at times on this front
[time=2400] is when I bump into a parent in whatever situation might be brewing, oftentimes it's just flat out in the middle of a parent child meltdown.
[time=2411] And believe me, I've been there.
[time=2415] Believe me, I've been this parent and I've given this look.
[time=2421] But it's the look I see and it breaks my heart because of what we're talking about right here.
[time=2425] And the look is this, the catastrophe's just kind of unfolding right around him or her and she looks at you or he looks at you with the look that kind of says, "Hey, you know, it's kids, what are you gonna do?" And I understand that.
[time=2440] I've been embarrassed like that.
[time=2444] I've felt that sense of, oh my gosh, they didn't just do that or say that.
[time=2450] But they're just kids, what are you gonna do?
[time=2456] What you're gonna do is you're gonna parent and you're gonna try again and you're gonna get out in front of it and you're going to do what God gives you and I, the privilege of doing early on, which is to lead them and not allow them to lead you because they don't know how to lead you.
[time=2476] Thank God for the strength and the encouragement
[time=2482] that he gives us through those years.
[time=2483] We move on to those middle years, like 13 to 18-ish and what we've put there is just coach, you get the, sorry for the athletic analogy, which is kind of where my mind goes.
[time=2495] You get the privilege of moving on from a godly spiritual investment where you're leading them and there's a control that you bring as parameters are tightly established to coaching as the funnel gets wider.
[time=2508] In this timeframe, there's continued deepened instruction,
[time=2514] which is what good coaching does, it continues to instruct.
[time=2518] It's now mixed with a huge amount of love and inspiration and encouragement, it's what coaches do.
[time=2525] They go over X's and O's and they teach and they instruct and then they do their very best to get down there on the sidelines and encourage and inspire and motivate and instill in them, whether it's athletic, whether it's spiritual, whether it's relational, whether it's friends at school, whether it's handling temptations, whatever it might be, you're there and you're for them and they know it and you've been instructing them and yes, you've got the whistle on the clipboard and when they mess up, which comes with this stage, I wrote it down here, huge amounts of love, inspiration, encouragement for them to choose wisely, out on the floor, if you will, coupled with clear parameters and increasing freedom to fail, you know, back at the beginning, there was some freedom to fail, but I didn't want to provide too much of that because I wanted to train them to know what it was like to succeed.
[time=2587] And now you get here and it's one of the hardest things, many of you know it more than I do, it's one of the hardest things in parenting, to watch and walk off the cliff.
[time=2595] Just to watch them, just to know that you have to let them walk off that cliff, fall, get hurt, bloody, broken, messed up and then scamper down that trail, pick them up and coach them, love them back into the game.
[time=2617] Coupled with clear parameters and increasing freedom to fail and at 13 to 18, still significant consequences because that's life.
[time=2628] And guess what, they're getting very close to life, real life as we say, it's just around the corner.
[time=2636] And so we continue to provide that for them.
[time=2640] See it's a challenge because a lot of times at 13 to 18 and I don't think it's just with girls, I think it's boys and girls, I watch parents do it all the time, including me, 13 to 18, we wanna be buddies.
[time=2652] 13 to 18, we wanna be friends.
[time=2655] I certainly am not against, you know me, I'm certainly not against friendship with your kids.
[time=2661] I wanna make sure I say that.
[time=2662] I'm learning, I need to say things.
[time=2665] Clearly, I got a letter last week from a gal, very disturbed after hearing the message on submission.
[time=2676] Accusing and scolding and putting me in my place and we just didn't, I don't think we connected.
[time=2683] But I'm not sure she heard and I gotta make sure I say things clearly.
[time=2687] I know that I'm friends with my kids at 13 to 18,
[time=2693] there is a friendship factor there.
[time=2695] It's not the priority and it does not dominate the landscape of that stage.
[time=2701] What dominates the landscape of this stage is the privilege God has given you to coach, to mentor, to invest deeply, those things that were started at the beginning, now with even clearer parameters and increasing freedom to fail and significant consequences so that they can learn through your loving guidance, how that works, all leading to the privilege that many of you in the room have experienced with 19 years and up and the opportunity God gives you to be a counselor, to be a friend, to be a confidant.
[time=2733] 19 and on, here a natural freedom is experienced
[time=2739] as they begin to move out from under, but a deep, listen, but a deep relationship.
[time=2745] A deep friendship has been built
[time=2752] and that is a sweet, sweet thing.
[time=2754] And that allows you the privilege of enjoying with them.
[time=2758] I think all that God has designed for you to have with them.
[time=2761] And some of you are looking at this going, "Wow, I missed eight years, doesn't matter.
[time=2766] "Just jump in, you just jump in." And you begin to ask for help and you begin to think through these kinds of principles.
[time=2773] And it is possible for you to have a relationship with a son or a daughter where they honor you, as it says in Ephesians six, two and three.
[time=2784] Parents, don't provoke.
[time=2786] Moving on to six, four fathers.
[time=2789] We talked about this last week, really fathers and mothers here by the use of the Greek word there for fathers.
[time=2794] Parents, in other words, don't provoke.
[time=2797] Don't exacerbate your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
[time=2806] On your note sheet, it says their parents don't provoke, but instead discipline them and instruct them toward the Lord.
[time=2812] Toward what, toward submission to the Lord.
[time=2816] This is all about submission.
[time=2818] This is all about the relationships that God addresses here in Ephesians and the priority of submitting ourselves to his design and those he has placed over us.
[time=2831] Parents, don't provoke, but discipline and instruct.
[time=2835] Just two things quick.
[time=2836] One about discipline, one about instruction.
[time=2840] People ask me often when we're having parenting conversations, do you discipline your kids?
[time=2846] The answer is yes.
[time=2848] Yes, from the very beginning, we have disciplined, our kids, different levels of discipline.
[time=2853] Sometimes, clearly the biblical teaching on discipline is that there is a sense of pain and loss that comes.
[time=2862] It's all throughout the scripture.
[time=2864] God disciplining, God chastising, God bringing pain into the life of his people so as to discipline them and remind them of what's true and right and good.
[time=2876] And so yes, I think there are different forms of discipline, different levels of discipline, but I think from the very beginning, we have to do our very best to listen lovingly, with great sensitivity, with great love and sensitivity, we have to be able to at the same time communicate to them that disobedience hurts.
[time=2898] And there's not an adult in this room that wouldn't raise their hand and say, no, it doesn't.
[time=2906] It does.
[time=2909] And then not only is there physical pain, but there's just, there's relational pain, there's circumstantial loss.
[time=2917] I mean, there is a sense where if we don't discipline with great intent, love and grace and forthrightness, I believe we do them a huge disservice and I think that's why it says don't provoke them to anger, don't exasperate them, don't just keep talking to them and talking and talking and talking.
[time=2938] No, discipline them, do it lovingly, do it with a godly heart, but do it and instruct.
[time=2947] And I wanna just take you back to a passage.
[time=2950] Many of you are familiar with, let me just read it to you again.
[time=2952] Let me hear your pages turn.
[time=2953] If you would, back to Deuteronomy.
[time=2955] Would you do that, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus numbers?
[time=2958] Go to Deuteronomy six, if you would, it says there.
[time=2962] Initially here, talking to the people of Israel, God's chosen people, he quickly turns though, to the parental component that they had in their lives.
[time=2972] Here, oh Israel, Deuteronomy six, four.
[time=2975] Here, oh Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one.
[time=2979] You shall love the Lord, your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.
[time=2986] Do you love him that way, people?
[time=2988] Do you love him like that?
[time=2990] These words, verse six, which I am commanding you today shall be on your heart.
[time=2997] You shall teach them, verse seven, he goes to parents, to the people, he says, have them on your heart.
[time=3004] Why have them on your heart?
[time=3006] Because you shall, verse seven, teach them diligently to your sons and daughters.
[time=3012] And you shall, as parents, given to a God-honoring life and this privilege of raising kids with a deep understanding of who he is, you shall teach them these words of God, diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, think of what you do, I'm thinking of what I do when I sit in my house.
[time=3035] When you walk, by the way, in the Hebrew, that talks about, leaves your time, free time, time that you have to do something with when you walk by the way, when you lie down before you go to bed, and when you rise up, when you get up, when you sit in the house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down and when you rise up, you shall teach them diligently to your sons and daughters.
[time=3068] You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead.
[time=3076] You shall write them on the doorpost of your house and on your gates.
[time=3081] Literally and or figuratively, it just makes a lot of sense.
[time=3086] As frontals on your forehead, you're binding them to your body, you walk around, your kids look at you and they see the word of God.
[time=3098] They live with you and they sense and see in you this commitment to make it primary.
[time=3104] This whole passage talks about, really, the inundation that you provide as a parent to that child of the word of God.
[time=3116] And this is where I just have to back up and say, okay, now I'm right with you all on this.
[time=3120] I've got to work on this.
[time=3121] I've been making efforts over the years.
[time=3124] I'm thankful for the growth we're getting there.
[time=3126] But when you and I stop and think about all that we're inundating them with, when you and I start thinking about all the places we're taking them, when we stop and think about all the stuff we're buying them, when we stop and think about all the investment that we're making in them, all that we're providing them with, all that we're exposing them to.
[time=3152] And here it says that the primary, right up there at the forefront of all that stuff I just said should be us teaching them, the life-changing, eternity-altering truth of God's word.
[time=3167] Don't provoke them, which you will do if you don't do this.
[time=3175] Don't provoke them, but discipline them and instruct them toward the Lord.
[time=3181] Deuteronomy 4, don't miss that.
[time=3185] What a powerful, powerful passage.
[time=3188] Let's go back to Ephesians.
[time=3189] Let me just finish up this section if I can.
[time=3193] It says back in Ephesians 6.
[time=3196] Right there in verse five, slaves
[time=3206] or in this context for us today, there were slaves and there were masters in Ephesus here, the application for you and I would clearly be employees and employers.
[time=3217] It's talking about you and your boss here.
[time=3220] Be obedient to those who are your bosses,
[time=3226] according to the flesh.
[time=3228] In the flesh, I love how he does this.
[time=3231] Again, he wants to help you bring perspective to this discussion.
[time=3236] In the flesh, he or she is your boss, right?
[time=3241] Be obedient to those who are your bosses, according to the flesh, with fear and trembling in the sincerity of your heart as to Christ.
[time=3252] Now he just takes it out of the flesh and he puts it in perspective and I know it's a little bit of a stretch, but really what we've got to do here is you've got to begin to look at your boss like he or she is Jesus.
[time=3264] I hope those who work for me are listening.
[time=3271] I'm just kidding.
[time=3272] We laugh about that, but it's really a profound thought
[time=3278] and it makes it easier in marriage
[time=3284] and it makes it easier as a child looking at my parent and it makes it easier in the workplace.
[time=3289] It says it right there, as to Christ.
[time=3293] Not by way of I service as men pleasers, but as slaves of Christ doing your job, your job here in this context is the will of God, doing the will of God from the heart.
[time=3306] So I'm to go to work in the morning and I'm to give myself to this endeavor from my heart and with sincerity of heart as if serving Christ himself, I'm gonna serve Bob.
[time=3317] I'm gonna give myself to her or to him and I'm gonna give myself to her or to him with great passion and with great faithfulness and with great sincerity.
[time=3327] It's gonna be a diligent and well-offered effort.
[time=3331] With good will render service as to the Lord
[time=3337] and not to men, knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord whether slave or free.
[time=3346] So be watch, watch, so be obedient to them with fear and trembling, with great respect for them and the sincerity of your heart, don't do I service, don't do lip service, but as slaves of Christ who are doing the will of God, render service as to your king and then watch this verse nine and masters, any of you in the room bosses, do the same thing.
[time=3375] Treat them that way, mutual submission,
[time=3381] again, everywhere you go in this context, you see it again and again.
[time=3387] You before me, how can I serve you?
[time=3392] How can I minister to you?
[time=3394] Masters do the same thing to them and give up threatening.
[time=3400] Give up threatening knowing that both their master and yours is in heaven and there is no partiality with him.
[time=3412] Great truth, my friends, for the home and the office, let me pray for you this morning that God will give you grace, encourage and strength to apply these things so that we will be doers of God's word and not just hearers.
[time=3427] Would you stand with me, please?
[time=3430] Father in heaven, we are grateful this morning for the truth that we've been reminded of, God, the design that you've given, especially God this morning to the family.
[time=3441] What a responsibility we have as parents to lovingly and gently yet with great purpose and intention God build into the lives of our kids through godly loving discipline and instruction.
[time=3456] God, we need your help on that front.
[time=3459] We need friends to come alongside and provide accountability.
[time=3463] We need staff people and elders to come alongside and encourage us.
[time=3469] In memory of Dan Mater as he will be celebrating his 80th birthday on Friday, May 28th, his second in heaven with Jesus.
[time=3477] We love you and miss you from Fay Mater and family.
