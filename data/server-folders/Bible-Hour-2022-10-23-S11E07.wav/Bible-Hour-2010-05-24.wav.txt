[time=296] (dramatic music) - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=304] It's great to have all of you here.
[time=306] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=308] I am so looking forward to this summer here at Black Hawk.
[time=311] I know summer brings with it all kinds of great opportunities.
[time=315] We hope that maybe this summer you could be a part of and be encouraged by what God's gonna be doing through our family here at Black Hawk.
[time=323] I wanna tell you just about a couple of things.
[time=326] We're taking the summer 14 week span and kind of getting our family and those interested to chance to be a part of three different things.
[time=334] A unique gathering, connecting and going opportunity.
[time=339] On the going front, I wanna tell you about this.
[time=341] We're gonna have teams, going serving teams that are going out every Sunday morning through the summer at nine o'clock to do work projects in our neighborhood, in our surrounding community.
[time=353] We can't wait to take our tools and take our equipment and do whatever we can do to help in real ways those who have needs.
[time=361] And I wanna tell you this, if you know somebody, you in our Bible Hour viewing audience, if you know someone or you have a personal need in your home, if it's some gardening or some electrical work or some mild construction or anything we could do to help you in your home or on your property.
[time=378] I want you to email me.
[time=380] My email address is right here at the bottom of the screen.
[time=383] If you have some needs or you have some family members or some friends down the street who have some needs, we would love to all through the summer be sending our teams out into our neighborhood to help those who have legitimate needs and encourage them in the process.
[time=398] I can't wait to see our family out on the streets, if you will, doing their thing that first hour, nine to 10.30 on Sunday mornings, then we're gonna have one big service at 10.45 and we can't wait for the chance to worship together as a family.
[time=413] Also, we're gonna have some connecting opportunities this summer.
[time=417] If you've been thinking about coming to Black Hawk, if you've been thinking about joining this family and coming and experiencing what you see on the Bible Hour live and in person, we would love to connect you with a smaller group and give you a chance to make some friends and grow in the process.
[time=433] We're encouraging all of our people at Black Hawk to join a smaller setting, an adult class, a Bible study, a small group, and we have those offered and available during that first hour as well, and we'd love to help you get connected if that's something that would be of interest to you.
[time=449] For those who need a first hour, nine o'clock to 10.30 worship service, we're actually starting a new worship service, kind of a new interactive gathering.
[time=459] It's gonna be in a different location than our worship center.
[time=462] It's gonna be across the street in our student ministry's room.
[time=465] I'm gonna be leading this new interactive, kind of informal teaching time with worship and all the things that come usually with worship.
[time=473] It's just gonna be in a different setting, in a different format, a chance for us to be a little more personal and interactive with our audience, and I am so looking forward to that.
[time=483] It's gonna be a great summer across the board.
[time=486] If you have any questions about any of this, please email me, let us know what's on your heart and mind.
[time=491] We're thankful for you and wanna include you in all that God is doing at Blackhawk.
[time=496] I hope you'll join us, and I hope this morning's message from Ephesians 6 will be an encouragement to you as we all of us try and stand strong in the full armor of our Lord.
[time=508] It's an amazing fight that we face each and every day, and then I hope it encourages your soul as you hear and take in our teaching on this.
[time=515] Thank you, as always, for tuning in, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=520] God bless.
[time=521] [MUSIC - 27 seconds]
[time=550] - Proclamation.
[time=552] [MUSIC - 57 seconds]
[time=627] (upbeat music) - On September 27th, Pastor Kelly gave a message on
[time=636] why are we desperate for God?
[time=641] Why don't we long for God?
[time=643] And what prevents us from longing for Him?
[time=647] And that really opened my heart and my eyes because I have, I got so busy.
[time=656] And my quiet time with the Lord just squeezed out into nothing, almost nothing really.
[time=664] And I was doing ministries on the run and paying on the run and that day it just, I said it has to stop, I can't do it this way anymore.
[time=675] So I went home and I said, I'm gonna prioritize my time and I'm gonna have my quiet time with the Lord, no matter what.
[time=686] I am at Simuluketa and I'm grateful that God is using black art to grow me as a disciple.
[time=694] Part of the thing that first comes to my mind
[time=702] is I've always been a part of small groups but I kind of taken a break from that for a while and recently got plugged back into a group and I think that's just been really life-giving.
[time=714] Crying and worshiping and building relationships, living life together has been really good for me.
[time=721] And so I'm really thankful for that and I'm thankful that we've talked about it a lot and that really encouraged me to get plugged back in.
[time=729] I'm Janice Mariezy and I am grateful that God is using black art to grow me as a disciple.
[time=737] - I think that the cool thing for me is the freedom
[time=743] to use my passions and giftings and to succeed and to fail.
[time=752] One of the things I'm most excited about in the men's ministry is that we were doing some stuff that was garnering attention from other churches and I had people calling me to say, "Let's talk about all the things you're doing regarding men's fraternity." And as we're doing those things, our numbers kept shrinking and shrinking and shrinking.
[time=770] And the guys said, "We wanna do men's fraternity again." And so I'll do it, but I'll do no work.
[time=775] I'm not gonna promote it.
[time=777] I'm not gonna do videos.
[time=778] I'm not going to do all the things I've done before.
[time=781] And if it succeeds, it'll succeed only because it got it and we're growing and guys are digging deep.
[time=788] And sometimes you learn to scale the way it got.
[time=791] And I think that's been a neat process to have the opportunity to fail.
[time=796] And sometimes, I guess in my spiritual walk, with believers, when people fail, there's a tendency to say, "Let's take away the opportunity for them to fail again versus let's them keep learning and exploring and work this out." So one of the things that I appreciate about Black Hawk so much is the ability to exercise the gifts, to work with God, to work things out, to have successes, to have failures and to connect with other people.
[time=827] I'm Todd Larson and I'm grateful that God is using Black Hawk to grow me as a disciple.
[time=833] - Open your Bibles if you would this morning.
[time=838] To Ephesians six, we're here in this last chapter of this study that God has given us the privilege of being a part of and giving ourselves to for the last several months.
[time=848] We're coming close to the end today and next Sunday will be our final installment of the truth, the way and the life, the truth about our salvation, the way in which God has called us to live this salvation out and the life, the life that this leads to, the life that is as the Apostle Paul said, truly life.
[time=871] We come today to Ephesians six versus 10 to 13 and before we get there, I wanna just confess something to you.
[time=879] I don't know that it's really a confession, it's just the truth about me, it'll show my age.
[time=884] I know on the action, adventure, action, hero, front, on the movies, on the movie front these days, I know I'm way behind, I know several years ago it was Keanu Reeves and that Matrix thing and I don't forget his name, kids, what was his name, Neo or something like that, he was the big action hero guy and I know Iron Man is out, these Iron Man two is out and we're all flocking to watch Iron Man, the good guy to feed the bad guy.
[time=913] There was in recent years the guy that had the claws pop out, it was at Wolverine, all kinds of action hero.
[time=920] For me, all right, I'm 47 years old, I grew up with a certain action adventure hero and I'm not condoning everything about this guy, I'm just being honest with you though and it ties into where we're going today, I liked James Bond, all right?
[time=936] I thought James Bond was cool, I really did.
[time=940] And anybody in the room who ever watched a James Bond flick, you know this, you know this, you've got to admit this, that aside from all the shenanigans, aside from the women in the cars and all that stuff, there was this point in the movie that you always look forward to, I look forward to it, every James Bond flick, because there was a time where James went downstairs into the basement of the Secret Service headquarters and he'd hook up with the head technical technology guy, I think he called him Q, and every single movie Q would pull James Bond aside and show him some new invention having to do with a weapon.
[time=981] Come on, say yes, you remember that, right?
[time=984] Yeah, everybody over 50, thank you.
[time=986] So here's the deal, kids, 'cause you don't remember this, every single James Bond movie, James Bond, would be having to go and face the enemy, face danger, face certain death and so every movie he would be sent out with this unbelievable technology and it was really cool, it would be like a Q would show him this pen, this ballpoint pen that was really in the heat of the battle used as a laser machine gun, he would just kill people with this pen.
[time=1018] I mean, there were times where he would be up against thousands of soldiers from the enemy camp and a cufflink would serve as a hand grenade and they'd all get blown into pieces, real good stuff, you're welcome to church on Sunday morning.
[time=1034] (audience laughing) There were times where tie pins, we don't use tie pins anymore, but tie pins would be used as like poisonous doosh darts.
[time=1045] It was so cool.
[time=1046] Okay, come on, just give me some grace here.
[time=1052] But here's the deal, here's the deal.
[time=1054] Q wanted James to have these things 'cause he knew he was going into battle.
[time=1059] He knew he was going into a fight and he knew that the fight would be tough and he knew there would be times where James would be at his wits end and completely unable to face it any longer and would need some kind of extra super special protection.
[time=1075] And this morning, my friends, I thought about it this week, we come to a passage here that reminds every one of us in the room, every one of you listening to my voice, all of you watching in on the broadcast today, this passage reminds every one of us that have named the name of Christ.
[time=1095] Every one of you that has fully surrendered your heart and life to him, everybody, who stands in an effort alongside our king to move his kingdom forward, every one of you, whether you realize it, admit it, engage in it or not is in the fight of your life.
[time=1116] You are, we are, I am, the scriptures teach us under attack and the attack is enormous and the attack is relentless
[time=1127] and the attack is supernatural and the foe is not the evil sources in a James Bond movie, but Satan himself.
[time=1138] Satan, the scriptures teach us this morning, my friends, is out to kill you.
[time=1144] Satan is out to destroy you.
[time=1147] Satan is out to dismantle you and me and any spiritual impact and any spiritual effect we can have and so we come this morning to Ephesians chapter six verses 10 to 13 and would you in honor of God's word stand and allow me to read this to you.
[time=1165] Ephesians chapter six verses 10 to 13, he says, finally, and he is making his way toward the end of this letter and he says to all who listen there at the church in Ephesus and to all of you here at the church in Blackhawk, finally he says, brothers and sisters, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might, put on the full armor of God so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil, for our struggle is not against flesh and blood, it's not physical.
[time=1201] No, our struggle is against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places, therefore take up the full armor of God so that you will be able to resist in the evil day and having done everything to stand firm.
[time=1225] Take up the full armor of God so that you will be able to resist how is it that you'll be able to resist because you have done everything, everything to stand firm.
[time=1241] Father, this is our prayer this morning that you would help us understand what it would be like and what it would look like God to do everything within our power and with your help and encouragement to stand and to resist, to navigate the tumultuous waters of this unbelievable battle and fight
[time=1267] that has been waged against us as believers.
[time=1270] God, we wanna respect in a way we want to understand,
[time=1276] maybe better said the enemy, but God more than that, we wanna understand what it is that you've provided us with, how it is God that you have equipped us to face this fight and to face it well.
[time=1291] So God teach us these things and show us these things this morning in your son's name, we pray.
[time=1296] [AMEN] Let me just read this to you, the believer, the true believer, the genuine believer described in chapters one through three, again in chapters one through three, we saw the reality of our salvation and that the true believer described in chapters one to three who lives the life laid out for us in chapters four, five and six can be sure, no doubt, no maybe, no it's possible, no can be sure to encounter a spiritual war as described here in our passage this morning.
[time=1334] Paul closes this letter with both warning about that war and instructions on how we can both fight it and win it, how we can engage in it and engage in it successfully from the spiritual personal vantage point, the Lord provides his saints, that you and me, with sufficient armor, the passage teaches, with sufficient armor to combat and thwart the adversary in verses 10 to 13, the apostle briefly sets forth the basic truths regarding the believer's necessary spiritual preparation as well as truths regarding his enemy, his battle and his victory.
[time=1378] In verses 14 to 17, which you'll get to next week, he specifies the six most necessary pieces of spiritual armor with which God equips his children to resist and overcome Satan's assaults.
[time=1395] Six very important pieces of armor that you don't have to go out and buy, you don't have to go out and look for as a believer, you don't have to wonder if maybe you somehow got the right stuff, no, six pieces of armor that are yours as a believer given to you by God to live life and fight this war in a way that can be fruitful and productive.
[time=1422] And so we come this morning to this teaching and this instruction regarding the war that we find ourselves in, we've entitled the message, choose your weapons and the first thing I want you to look at is the reality of war.
[time=1437] Would you write that down the reality of this war?
[time=1442] And all I wanna tell you and what I wanna show you here basically is summed up and maybe this statement, there has never been a day, I hope you understand this, never has there been a day since Genesis 3, that he the enemy Satan himself has not been trying
[time=1458] to ruin you, destroy you or dismantle your spiritual impact, your spiritual life, your spiritual heart, trying to ruin it, trying to destroy it, trying to dismantle it each and every day since the fall and he will continue to give himself to that, each and every day until he is once and for all vanquished by God into the lake of fire.
[time=1487] That's the truth.
[time=1489] Now, what I wanna make sure you understand, and I think this is important for you to understand and this is kind of a heads and tails here, there's kind of two sides to this discussion and I think both sides are worth pointing out here as we begin.
[time=1506] While it is true that he is, while it is true that he is a formidable foe,
[time=1515] while it is true that he brings with him all the artillery and all the arrows and all the bullets and all the temptations and all the wickedness and all the schemes that he brings, I wanna remind you of what one author I read this week said and he said it this way, he said please remember, believer, he said remember ultimately Satan's power over Christians is already broken and the great war has been won, amen?
[time=1548] Through Christ's crucifixion and resurrection which forever conquered the power of sin and death, however, in life on earth, battles of temptation and wickedness will go on on a regular basis until the final end.
[time=1566] The Lord's power, the strength of his spirit and the force of biblical truth are required for daily victory as the believer is forced to fight this fight which has already been ended.
[time=1581] Make sense?
[time=1584] Best illustration I can give you, I'm sorry, back to movies now and action heroes.
[time=1590] Best illustration I can give you, you've seen it a hundred times whether it was the Western or whether it was whoever, you know, whatever movie you wanna think about, it's when the bad guy takes the fatal hit.
[time=1599] I mean, he's been hit, he's gonna die but there's got six more bullets and so on his way down, he starts knocking off people in his last gasp and his last effort to do harm, he does.
[time=1612] He's gonna die but he's got some bullets left, right?
[time=1615] Satan's gonna die, Satan's gonna be gone.
[time=1620] It's gonna be over but in the meantime as he's making his way down, he's gonna knock off as many of you as he possibly can.
[time=1628] The reality of war, there's never been a day since Genesis three, it's a real fight, it's a real enemy, the reality is there.
[time=1637] First Peter, five eight, would you turn there?
[time=1639] Go back in your New Testament to the book of first Peter back toward the back, you'll find it.
[time=1644] Just before you get to first John, go to first Peter, it's right after James.
[time=1652] Let me hear those pages turned, come on.
[time=1654] First Peter, five eight.
[time=1657] Here Peter, realizing the reality of the spiritual battle
[time=1663] that those who would read this letter, those who were believers in the early days of the church, he realized what they were up against, he wanted to warn them, he wanted to encourage them and he says in first Peter five eight, he says, so be sober, be sober, be of sober spirit,
[time=1682] be on the alert, your adversary, your enemy, the one who is against you, it's what that word means, the devil prowls around like a roaring, what, lion?
[time=1694] Doesn't prowl around like a roaring cat, doesn't prowl around like a roaring guinea pig, he doesn't prowl around like a roaring, no, he picks the meanest, he picks the most ferocious, he picks the most violent, picks the most painful illustration he could find, he prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to, what, say it out loud, devour.
[time=1723] That word in the original language, devour, was a word that brought with it great physical pain, no kidding, to be devoured.
[time=1731] It's a word that brought with it great physical pain, it was a word that literally had incontation with it the idea of being torn limb from limb.
[time=1739] And he says, do not be drunk, don't be sloppy,
[time=1746] do not for a moment fall asleep at the wheel,
[time=1752] be sober, be on the alert, be aware, don't just be aware of what's in front of you, be aware of what's behind you, be aware of what's out in front of you, be on the immediate, we need to think about this and consider this individually for sure, but I think of even parents with our kids, I think about parents with our small kids, I think about parents with adolescent kids, I think about any of us who have the opportunity and responsibility to give guidance and leadership and too many times our guidance and leadership with them is short-sighted and he says, be on the alert, be aware, see down the road what can come and take steps to be wise and prudent, protecting and providing guidance and safety in whatever ways possible, be on the alert, be quick, don't be slow, be wise, don't be foolish,
[time=1817] the devil, your adversary, prowls around looking for someone to tear limb from limb.
[time=1826] He's trying to ruin, he's trying to destroy, he's trying to dismantle moms and dads, he's trying to keep you from your ultimate spiritual expression
[time=1842] to raise up and nurture children in the admonition in the teaching and wisdom and instruction of the Lord, he's trying to dismantle your efforts as parents, he's your adversary, it's a real fight, he's trying to dismantle you as businessmen and women trying to throw you off ethically, trying to move you toward a passionate love of cash over character, resources over that which is true and right, he's going after pastors, he's going after students, he's going after congressmen, he stops at nothing, the results are as many of you have seen in this last week
[time=1897] as you've read the papers and as you've watched the television tragic.
[time=1901] Got a lot of emails and a lot of hallway conversations
[time=1908] people asking me about our response to something like what we've seen with congressmen's sout and I'll say to you what I've said to them first and foremost you should be, we should be, I have been, I hope you have been, we should be praying for him, should be praying for his family, we should just be collectively as the body of Christ begging God to give them all the strength and grace that they'll need to face the days ahead.
[time=1934] It's been good I think to remind people though that in the midst of the tragedy, in the midst of the great disappointment, in the midst of the frustration, make no mistake, the name of God will not be smothered, the truth about all that Mark had stood for over the years will not be dismantled, the name of the Lord will stay lifted up, the people of God will rally that family, that family will with hearts that are willing, as time goes by they'll be restored, trust can be reestablished, family can live in unity, amen, power of God is able to make new, that which has been broken.
[time=1979] Those of you who have in the process picked up stones, you better put them down, those of you who think it's no big deal, if you're wrong it is, it's a huge deal.
[time=1995] But I wanna tell you this, as important as that's been, as big a deal as it is, the adversary who's prowling around like a roaring lion and about to dismantle you, mom, you dad, you business, man or woman, I think it's just as significant.
[time=2016] I think it's just as important.
[time=2018] I think your calling is just as vital and it's a real war with a real enemy who wants to really destroy you.
[time=2028] And if you're not careful, if you're not alert, if you're not sober, he will.
[time=2033] The reality of war.
[time=2036] He goes on to talk about in the passage, the preparation for war, look at verse 10, go back if you would to Ephesians 6.
[time=2046] You see there in Ephesians 6, verses 10 and 11, there's language here that speaks clearly and strongly to the preparation that we shouldn't make for this fight.
[time=2058] Finally, be strong in the Lord.
[time=2061] And in the strength of his might, put on the full armor of God so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.
[time=2072] Three things I want you to write down there.
[time=2074] Be strong, put on the full armor and stand firm.
[time=2082] Let's start with being strong.
[time=2083] It says there at the beginning of 10, be strong in the who?
[time=2087] Be strong in the Lord.
[time=2089] Please understand that while physical strength, while physical discipline, while there is a notion that I think has some spiritual connotations to it, that you and I should be physically in shape, while there is some value, I think, to being physically strong and healthy.
[time=2109] What he's talking about here, my friends, is in the spiritual realm.
[time=2113] He's saying to you in the spiritual arena, work out.
[time=2117] In the spiritual arena, get buff.
[time=2122] In the spiritual arena, do whatever you've got to do.
[time=2125] Put your miles in and be strong spiritually.
[time=2130] Be strong in the Lord.
[time=2134] A spiritual workout, I've told you this for years.
[time=2137] I'm gonna tell it to you this morning.
[time=2138] I'm sure I'll tell it to you again.
[time=2139] There are three components.
[time=2141] Three components, I think, to a spiritual workout that are so important that you and I understand and not just understand but practice.
[time=2149] I watched us get to this point in our life at home where I saw an 18-year-old beginning to make his way out.
[time=2160] And I'll be honest with you, and many of you can just shake your heads and smile 'cause you've been here, others if you haven't gotten here yet, so you can be warned.
[time=2168] I began to, just as he was getting closer and closer to this time of leaving, I started to take a deep breath and think, "Whew, I made it." But the recliner started to look really good, if you know what I mean.
[time=2183] I started to take a deep breath and thought, "Wow, we kinda made it through all that I can actually relax." And then I looked and I see four other kids on the driveway bouncing the ball saying, "Where are you? Come on." I told Deborah about six months ago, I said, "I gotta get, I gotta get in shape." I just let myself go a little bit and it just didn't feel sharp and I wasn't sleeping great and I just wasn't clear.
[time=2208] So six months ago, five months ago, started working out again.
[time=2212] And it's just been amazing.
[time=2213] Lost a bunch of weight, fitting into pants.
[time=2216] I didn't use to that whole nine yards, but here's the point, I go three, four days a week, go over to the gym.
[time=2221] I don't walk around the gym looking at the equipment, saying, "Wow, it's kinda cool to be here." Whoa, I'm losing weight.
[time=2228] No, I sit down and I get worked out like a dog.
[time=2235] I mean, it's actually painful, it hurts.
[time=2238] Still hurts, it keeps hurting.
[time=2239] I keep waiting for it not to hurt, it doesn't, it keeps hurting.
[time=2243] And it's an hour and 10 minutes.
[time=2245] And there's engagement, there's getting into it, there's doing it and it requires an enormous amount of discipline and effort.
[time=2253] And spiritually, I'm here to tell you, there's three machines, there's three workouts, there's three things you've gotta be involved in.
[time=2258] You must be engaged in the Word of God.
[time=2261] You must be engaged in the Spirit of God and you must be engaged with the people of God.
[time=2267] If you lack any of the three, you're gonna get your clock cleaned.
[time=2273] You must be inundated with the Word of God, the Word of God must be a part of your daily life.
[time=2277] You've gotta be reading it, you've gotta be memorizing it, you've gotta be studying it, you've gotta be interacting with it, you've gotta be talking with people about it, you've gotta be applying it at work and at home.
[time=2289] The Word of God, the Scriptures, have got to be absolutely and utterly primary to your life because when you hide it in your heart, it helps you not sin against him.
[time=2303] When you know it and hide its truth in your heart, your view of God is raised above the faulty view of Satan's options, which he throws at you every day.
[time=2313] The Word of God has got to be engaged in the Spirit of God.
[time=2318] You and I have to be literally on our knees.
[time=2322] I mean this, you and I need to be on our knees, on our faces, morning, noon and night, begging the Spirit of God, relinquishing control of our lives, every component, every nook and cranny, every room of our life, we have to be on our faces, begging the Spirit of God to rule, asking him to overcome the flesh and moving it to the back and hoping that through his promptings and through his leadings and through his conviction and through his comfort, the Spirit of God would help us navigate these waters, these horrendous waters that you and I face as the enemy, the adversary, wages his war.
[time=2364] Does that make sense?
[time=2366] We have to articulate and surrender ourselves to the Spirit of God's ongoing presence and work in our lives.
[time=2375] And then you've got to ask somebody to help you.
[time=2379] There's got to be a woman in your life, there's got to be a man in your life, there's got to be somebody discipling you, there's got to be some group that you meet with on a regular basis, there's got to be an ABF on a Sunday morning, a home group on some weeknight, during the week, there has got to be in your life.
[time=2394] I don't stand here and talk about it week after week 'cause I think it's cool.
[time=2399] I stand here and talk about it week after week because if you don't have it, you'll die.
[time=2403] The Word of God, the Spirit of God, and the people of God around you in a setting where you're being loved and cared for and confronted and prayed with and celebrated it.
[time=2416] It's admonished.
[time=2417] It is a workout that you and I cannot afford to miss and it allows you and I to be strong in the Lord.
[time=2426] He goes on to say, put on the full armor.
[time=2429] Put on the full armor there in verse 11, put on the full armor of God so that you will be able to stand firm.
[time=2439] We'll get to this next week, but let me just read this to you.
[time=2443] Put on, you see there in the text where it says put on, put on the full armor, put on, conveys the idea of permanence, indicating that armor should be the Christian sustained life long attire.
[time=2458] This armor that you're gonna learn about next week isn't something that you put on and take off.
[time=2464] It is something that as a believer, you put on and keep on.
[time=2468] I was trying first hour to come up with an example and all I could think of was a sixth grade boy in his underwear.
[time=2476] You just never take it off.
[time=2477] (congregation laughing) They laughed harder than you did.
[time=2484] Sorry about that.
[time=2486] And you know, and then you just turn it inside out and you wear it even longer.
[time=2490] You don't take it off the armor of God.
[time=2491] The idea there of put on is one of permanence.
[time=2495] It's something that is on you.
[time=2500] Paul uses the common armor of the Roman soldiers as the analogy, the Roman soldiers of that day, which these people would have had an absolute clear understanding of what these six pieces of armor were, what they looked like, how they functioned.
[time=2517] This was the analogy for the believer's spiritual defense and affirms its necessity if one is to hold his position while under attack.
[time=2531] Put on the full armor, not, he says full, not half, not the two or three pieces that you think make the most sense
[time=2545] and we'll let the other two or three go.
[time=2547] Wait till you get to next week and you see the six and he wants, he says it twice in two verses.
[time=2552] He says, put the full armor on.
[time=2557] Peyton Manning isn't going to go under center in a real NFL game.
[time=2562] You'll never see it as long as you look.
[time=2564] Peyton Manning's not going to take a snap without with no helmet on.
[time=2567] It's not going to look at you and say, hey, relax, I've got my thigh pads on.
[time=2571] You're not going to see soldiers in Afghanistan riding around in the dirt trails in Prius's.
[time=2578] They're not driving Taurus's, they're driving armored vehicles, right?
[time=2586] For a reason, don't sort of come at this.
[time=2589] No, you fully engage.
[time=2592] Be strong.
[time=2594] Put on the full armor so that you can, third thing, I told you to write down, stand firm.
[time=2601] Stand firm, put on the full armor, verse 11, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.
[time=2612] Let me just show you something real quick here.
[time=2613] Go to Ephesians, just go back over to Ephesians 4.14.
[time=2617] There is a theme.
[time=2618] Whenever you see this phrase, standing firm in the New Testament, I just want to teach you this real quick.
[time=2625] Hang onto this, this is good to have in your heart and in your soul as you read through.
[time=2629] Go to 4.14.
[time=2630] Here is the theme that standing firm carries with it.
[time=2633] As a result, Ephesians 4.14, as a result, we are no longer to be what?
[time=2638] Say it, children.
[time=2640] As a result, we are no longer to be kids.
[time=2643] Tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by listen, by craftiness, in deceitful, what?
[time=2655] Say it, scheming, sound familiar?
[time=2658] As a result, we are no longer to be kids.
[time=2662] First, go to 1 Corinthians.
[time=2664] Go back, just past Galatians, going backwards, past Galatians to 1 Corinthians.
[time=2670] Go to 1 Corinthians 16.
[time=2672] Watch this, this is really good.
[time=2674] 1 Corinthians 16 says this.
[time=2677] Now, it's gonna sound really Ephesians 6-ish.
[time=2682] Look at 16, 1 Corinthians 16, 13.
[time=2685] He says, be on the alert.
[time=2688] There's a lot going on out there, people.
[time=2691] The church at Corinth was facing much of the same thing that the church at Ephesus was facing, and Paul says, look at it.
[time=2697] Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith.
[time=2701] Act like what?
[time=2704] He wasn't talking about males there.
[time=2707] He's talking about grow up.
[time=2710] Be strong.
[time=2714] Put on the full armor, stand firm.
[time=2718] Don't be a little kid.
[time=2720] Don't be juvenile about this.
[time=2722] No, grow up, be mature.
[time=2725] I love this verse.
[time=2726] Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith.
[time=2728] Act like men.
[time=2729] Be strong.
[time=2730] Let all that you do be done in love.
[time=2736] Philippians, go back to Ephesians and then just keep going.
[time=2740] One more book.
[time=2742] Philippians 1, 27.
[time=2744] You see the same thing, only conduct yourselves, it says.
[time=2748] In a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that you are standing firm.
[time=2759] Whether I come or not, you're mature enough.
[time=2762] Whether I come or not, you've grown up enough.
[time=2764] Whether I come or not, I have no fear of you being tossed here and there by schemes and craftiness.
[time=2771] No, you're standing firm and you're only able to stand firm because you've put the full armor on and you're strong.
[time=2780] Make sense?
[time=2785] It's why some of you in the room this morning and others of you
[time=2791] watching the broadcast and I'm so thankful for the honesty and the transparency that so many of you have evidenced in your willingness to share with me and our team, your struggles, and you know this.
[time=2806] I'm not saying anything you don't know, but it's why some of you are struggling so deeply and so disastrously, because you're not able to,
[time=2819] not willing, not able, not prepared to stand.
[time=2827] You haven't stood in a long, long time.
[time=2832] You're not drawing lines, you haven't been able to efficiently or appropriately size up the enemy because you're not sober or alert.
[time=2842] Things are catching you by surprise, stuff's catching you off guard.
[time=2846] There's been no lines drawn, there's been no stake in the ground, there is no strength to your fight, there is no fight because you're not prepared and you're not strong.
[time=2857] The armor isn't in place and it breaks your heart and breaks my heart and we want to do our best to come alongside, but I want to make sure you hear and see this this morning.
[time=2868] There are some things that you and I bring to this equation.
[time=2873] Be strong.
[time=2875] He's saying that to you.
[time=2878] I can't make you strong.
[time=2880] There are some things as we've just lined out here for you, for you to be a part of.
[time=2887] Put on the full armor that you put it on.
[time=2893] We're going to teach you how to do that next week. Stand firm. Grow up.
[time=2903] We've played this game in our home for years.
[time=2905] You used to play it with all five kids. It's a great game. You've all played it.
[time=2908] You've heard me talk about it for years. I don't play it with all five kids anymore.
[time=2911] I just play it with the two younger ones. It's just the great classic all-time, most unbelievable fun game of Rough House.
[time=2918] And there's all kinds of different ways to do it, but I'll tell you what, I love it still with my two younger ones. They'll get at the end of the hallway.
[time=2924] I'll be back on our bed, kind of a ranch-style house, long hallway, master bedroom on the end, on the left. They'll get a running start, 30, 40 feet down the hall.
[time=2933] Oh, I'm on the end of the bed with a pillow, right?
[time=2936] Kind of my arm inside the pillow almost as a forearm shield. It just did so much fun.
[time=2941] And they come running down that hall. They make that turn into the room.
[time=2944] Another eight feet to the bed. They leap up. I've taught them how to lead with their arm to try and deliver the most pain to the opponent.
[time=2952] They come flying up on that bed. They meet me head out and I just boom with the pillow and boom, they're back on their back on the floor.
[time=2960] So much fun.
[time=2964] And the thing is, I'm standing firm. You with me? They're not gonna knock me down.
[time=2972] They're gonna lose. They can back up to the garage. All right?
[time=2979] They can get on a skateboard. They can do anything they want, but when they fly through the air and they come up against a grown-up who's been there and who's learned some things
[time=2990] and developed some strength. You with me? They're not going anywhere.
[time=2995] Now, this is why I don't play it with my 18-year-old son anymore.
[time=3003] But I'm telling you, and I'm saying it nicely, but I'm saying it forthrightly,
[time=3009] you have got to grow up, friend. You have got to leave some things behind.
[time=3015] You have got to give yourself to the workout of your lifetime and begin to strengthen yourself for the fight that will kill you if you're not careful. Amen?
[time=3026] There is the reality of war. There is the preparation for war.
[time=3031] And there is the kind of war. And I want to make sure you look at this.
[time=3038] I want to make sure you understand this. Very important. The kind of war.
[time=3043] Look at the end of verse 11. You go back to Ephesians 6, end of 11.
[time=3051] You're able to stand firm against the what? Against the schemes of the devil.
[time=3056] For our struggle is not against flesh and blood. It's not physical.
[time=3062] It's not really out in the open, if you will, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[time=3077] Wow. There's a lot there, not enough time to explain all of that to you,
[time=3084] but it's suffice to say that this is a battle, my friends, that is not physical. It is against Satan. It is against principalities.
[time=3097] It is against demons. It is against a worldly Satan affected, Satan influenced philosophy.
[time=3105] It is against all that he has influenced. It's against all that he has contaminated.
[time=3111] It's against all that he has been given free reign and it is a battle.
[time=3117] And it's not like, it's not like, oh, Gettysburg or the Patriot.
[time=3124] I'm thinking of movies where we got to see the battles in the Civil War, you know, where it's kind of silly. We laugh at it today. You know how they used to fight, where the, you know, those guys would just like come over that hill and like, they'd be like wave at you and you'd say, okay, we're going to fight now.
[time=3140] And they'd get their muskets and they'd just start walking at each other, you know, what I mean? Just right out there in the open, just as clear as day, you know, exactly where it's coming from. It didn't flank you. It didn't trick you.
[time=3152] They didn't have guys buried under the ground. No, it was just we're walking towards you and we're shooting at you. And you know, we're coming and here we are. It's not that.
[time=3162] It's not that. This is telling you that it's coming at you.
[time=3167] Let me just read this to you. This was enlightening schemes.
[time=3172] The Greek word carries the idea of cleverness, crafty methods,
[time=3178] cunning and deceptive approaches. The word carries the idea of cleverness,
[time=3186] crafty methods, cunning and deceptive approaches. Satan's schemes are propagated through the evil world system over which he rules and are carried out by his demon hosts.
[time=3196] Schemes is all inclusive, encompassing every sin, immoral practice, false theology, false religion
[time=3204] and worldly enticement. Schemes. It's not a full frontal assault with tanks and
[time=3217] regiments and big signs saying, "Here we come." You know what it is? It's Navy Seals.
[time=3222] It's Navy Seals. It's you had no idea. You had no idea he was there.
[time=3231] It had no idea how far he had gotten and all of a sudden he's got his arm around your neck
[time=3239] and his blade out. The way this works, we talked about it first hour. The way this
[time=3246] works is this. It's like this. It's like, "Whoa, where'd you come from?"
[time=3255] And where he came from was, and you could talk to a lot of people about this.
[time=3262] You could talk to a lot of people about this and they'd tell you the exact same thing. Where
[time=3269] he came from was, he came from six months ago over here. And it wasn't that big of a deal.
[time=3276] It was just a small not being very sober, not being very alert, not being very strong,
[time=3284] few pieces of armor off. It's six months ago over here. It was just a little deal.
[time=3289] And then he just came over here about three months ago. It was another little bit bigger deal, but we kind of put it out real quick and it was six months ago over there and three months ago over here. And then all of a sudden, a few weeks ago it was here and we're just busy and we're doing things and we're not being alert. And all of a sudden it's just boom right there. And what's
[time=3310] right here is a roaring lion and you're done. It's over. A jaws are open up. You're like,
[time=3325] "Whoa, where'd you come?" Boom. Over. And he roars. Another one bites the dust and on he goes.
[time=3341] The kind of war is trickery. It's deceit. It lulls you to sleep. It's small compromises that
[time=3350] lead to huge ones. And I want to just say this and we're going to go. It's supernatural, not physical.
[time=3357] It is super, this is supernatural warfare. This is beyond science fiction. This is so out there.
[time=3368] This is so deep. This is so vast. It is so relentless. It is so sharp and polished.
[time=3375] It is so thought through. It is so evil. It is so destructive.
[time=3380] It is absolutely ongoing. It will never stop. It is not physical. It is supernatural,
[time=3388] which is why you need supernatural armor, which is what you're going to hear about next week.
[time=3397] I hope you'll be here. There's a lot. Listen, there's a lot at stake. Would you stand? Let me
[time=3404] pray for you, Father in heaven. As we stay on this morning, God, we stand with a great sense. I hope
[time=3410] of humility and dependence on you. God, this is a fight that even though the enemy has been hit,
[time=3418] even though we know he will die, God, the fight that he wages on his way down his deadly and cruel.
[time=3427] I pray, God, that you would give us in the room a willingness this week to come back again to this material. I pray we would access the digging deeper resource. I pray, God, that we would use it
[time=3438] with our own families, with ourselves, with our small groups, that we would use it to strengthen
[time=3444] our understanding of your truth on these matters we've just touched on this morning.
[time=3448] God, I thank you for the people who are here. I thank you for this family and what you're doing in us. Oh, God, may you continue to give us the strength we need to fight the battle of our life
[time=3460] in a way that would bring great glory and honor to you. And God, in a way that would
[time=3466] keep us alive, that would allow our spiritual impact not to be shaken, not to be destroyed or
[time=3472] dismantled. We pray these things, God, we hope these things and believe that you can achieve these
[time=3478] things in and through us. In your son's precious name, we pray. Amen.
[time=3508] [MUSIC]
