[time=233] [MUSIC]
[time=238] - Here's why he's delivered us.
[time=250] [MUSIC - 7 seconds]
[time=259] - Set our feet on the rock.
[time=261] [MUSIC - 3 seconds]
[time=269] - So here's what we're gonna do.
[time=271] I will not be moved.
[time=273] [MUSIC - 32 seconds]
[time=317] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 185 seconds]
[time=509] I hope you believe that this morning.
[time=511] Sing it again.
[time=512] [MUSIC - 17 seconds]
[time=532] - And all who agreed, son.
[time=540] - Amen, thanks for singing that to God with us.
[time=543] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=545] I love getting to say that week after week and we mean it, we're thankful that you're with us and so grateful that we can bring to you on a regular basis what we believe deep in our hearts to be the life-changing truth of the Word of God.
[time=560] And we're thankful for the way it's changing us and we're hopeful that it is affecting that same change in your life as well and it's good to have you with us.
[time=569] And I want to say thank you to Steve Longbreak.
[time=572] Steve Longbreak will bring to you in just a moment the final installment of our series on the Book of Ephesians.
[time=580] Steve has been a part of the Blackhawk family for years over a quarter of a century.
[time=585] He hates it when I say that, that makes him sound kind of old, but he is a wise and discerning friend and has made enormous contributions to this ministry.
[time=595] Steve served for almost 25 years as the administrator of our Christian school.
[time=600] Steve, as many of you know, has served in recent years as a teaching pastor here at Blackhawk and now serves as the chairman of our elder board.
[time=610] He is a good friend and I'm so thankful for the job that he did this past week as he concluded our study of Ephesians and the message you're gonna see here is about the armor of God.
[time=621] And I just want to encourage you to watch and listen as Steve kind of dissects that passage for you and reminds you of all that God has given you, all that God has provided you with as you and I fight and face this battle daily that the enemy, Satan, wages against us.
[time=640] So watch, listen, and be encouraged.
[time=642] I also want to tell you about what's coming up this summer.
[time=645] You may have heard me talking about it in recent weeks, but let me just say it like this.
[time=650] One thing I really cringe at is when I hear people talk about the Bible and they talk about it in ways.
[time=660] They talk about it as if it's a good book, but it doesn't really help them much because it's not very practical.
[time=667] They talk about the Bible as if it's some ethereal kind of far off thing that they have a hard time relating to in their real life.
[time=677] Well, I want you to know this summer we begin this coming Sunday, a 14 week look through June all the way through the middle of September.
[time=686] 14 stories, real, real stories, real people from the Bible whose lives and whose lessons learned provide us a chance to look into their lives and learn and take in those very same lessons.
[time=702] I can't wait for you to join us.
[time=704] I hope as always you'll come in person and join us.
[time=707] We have a new interactive gathering that meets across the street in our student ministry asylum at nine o'clock.
[time=715] I'm leading that and would love to have you join us for that.
[time=718] Then our 1045 service in the worship center all summer long lessons learned from the life of David Gideon, Noah, Mary, the Apostle Paul.
[time=732] I mean, the list is long of people whose lives we're going to look at and study.
[time=737] I hope you'll come.
[time=738] I hope you'll follow us.
[time=739] If you can't on the web on our website, we're gonna be tracking all the way through the summer with our ongoing digging deeper studies.
[time=747] After every Sunday message by about Wednesday, you can go to our website and click on the digging deeper icon and there you can continue in essence.
[time=758] The study we began on Sunday morning and I hope you'll watch the messages on the website.
[time=763] Hope you'll click on digging deeper.
[time=764] I can't wait for you and I, people who live real lives and face real challenges to be encouraged by those real people whose lives we get to look into in the very pages of scripture.
[time=777] I hope you'll join us.
[time=778] Thanks so much for tuning in today.
[time=780] God bless you and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=784] - I asked my wife to come today and just share with you a poem and prayer that I found this week in one of my favorite books.
[time=793] I think we've included a copy of it in your bulletin today and lighted this idea of Ephesians 6, Spiritual Warfare.
[time=801] I just thought this poem had so much truth packed into it.
[time=805] So I want to take a minute to go through it together today, just listen to Tanya, she prays it and let your heart to be open to its truth as well.
[time=814] - Oh Lord, I bless thee
[time=820] that the issue of the battle between thyself and Satan has never been uncertain and will end in victory.
[time=831] Calvary broke the dragon's head and I contend with a vanquished foe who in all his subtlety and strength has already been overcome.
[time=843] When I feel the serpent at my heel, may I remember him whose heel was bruised, but who when bruised crushed the devil's head.
[time=857] My soul with inward joy extols the mighty conqueror.
[time=862] Heal me of any wounds received in the great conflict.
[time=870] If I have gathered defilement, if my faith has suffered damage, if my hope is less than bright, if my heart is not fervent, if some creature comfort occupies my heart, if my soul sinks under the pressure of the fight.
[time=894] Oh thou.
[time=897] Every promise is balm.
[time=902] Every touch life draw near to thy weary warrior.
[time=909] Refresh me that I may rise again to wage the strife
[time=916] and never tire until my enemy is trodden down.
[time=920] Give me such fellowship with thee
[time=926] that I may defy Satan, unbelief the flesh, the world with delight that comes not from a creature and which a creature cannot mar.
[time=938] Give me a draw of the eternal fountain
[time=944] that lieth and thy immutable everlasting love and decree.
[time=949] Then shall my hand never weaken,
[time=955] my feet never stumble, my sword never rest, my shield never rust, my helmet never shatter, my breastplate never fall.
[time=967] As my strength rests
[time=973] in the power of thy might.
[time=975] [AMEN] (gentle piano music)
[time=1006] [MUSIC - 50 seconds]
[time=1059] (gentle piano music) Let's stand together and sing some more of that song in light of the truth that he has conquered.
[time=1069] (gentle piano music)
[time=1075] [MUSIC - 91 seconds]
[time=1169] Let's see it again.
[time=1171] [MUSIC - 15 seconds]
[time=1189] Let's put those scenes together.
[time=1193] [MUSIC - 113 seconds]
[time=1309] (audience applauding) - Jesus, we praise you this morning for being that lamb who has overcome death and the grave and the enemy.
[time=1320] And God, we know that Satan and his dominions are ultimately vanquished because of your work on the cross.
[time=1328] And we're thankful for times like this that we can sing about it and hide that truth in our hearts, God, so that when we go out and the rest of this day and the rest of this week, and we're bombarded with the forces of evil, we can stand confidently with the shield of faith.
[time=1342] It says, I know at the end of the day, Satan is vanquished.
[time=1347] And God, I pray that that would happen for each person in this room, that they wouldn't be tricked and fooled and deceived by the tricker and the fooler and the deceiver.
[time=1357] And God, that we would stand confidently dressed, ready for battle and ready to engage whatever you might allow us to engage in this week.
[time=1366] To the praise of your glory, we pray this.
[time=1368] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1371] - Well, have a few comments before we actually start the message this morning.
[time=1379] This is an elder talking to the congregation.
[time=1383] Hopefully representing the elders have talked to all of them about this stuff.
[time=1390] Haven't asked them specifically what I should say, but yeah, it's something about finances, but it's not just that.
[time=1398] And it's not me teaching you about giving.
[time=1401] We've been, you know, the last three years, we've reduced our budget.
[time=1408] And the last two years having reduced it, we've reduced it again for this coming year, but the last two years having reduced it, we still didn't meet our budget, which if that's what God wants for us, we're okay with that, but it means cutting things.
[time=1423] It means some things that maybe people wouldn't like.
[time=1427] The elders are overseers responsible to oversee
[time=1434] and shepherd the local church.
[time=1438] And we're trying to do that.
[time=1442] And we just, we really, really need your prayer because we're at a point now where we're making the kinds of decisions that we don't like at all.
[time=1451] We've never liked reducing things, but we're at a point now and it's not about some miraculous, you giving $500,000 at the end of the year thing.
[time=1461] It's really about us together seeking God, praying and begging him to give us each wisdom
[time=1472] to do our part, whatever our part is.
[time=1478] In 1975, I heard a guy preach a sermon on giving and I really hadn't heard it before that I should even consider something like 10% of my gross income.
[time=1490] I remember going home that day and talking to Renee, my wife at the time.
[time=1494] I said, have you heard that before?
[time=1497] Like 10% of your gross income?
[time=1500] She said, oh yeah, she'd been raised that way.
[time=1502] Well, the Bible doesn't say that you're supposed to give 10% of your gross income.
[time=1506] I'll just tell you that.
[time=1507] I don't think it does.
[time=1508] But it really caused me to start on a track that was really pretty healthy.
[time=1513] And that was a track of saying, God, what should I be doing to participate financially?
[time=1521] So we started that next week and we just gave 10% of our gross income the next week.
[time=1526] And I've been giving that much or more for 30, whatever how many years is that?
[time=1530] 70, oh my goodness.
[time=1532] 35 years.
[time=1534] And what's generous to you might be different from what's generous to me and God's gonna, but we just want you, would you please pray?
[time=1544] Just pray, beg him to give you complete peace if you're already doing enough there.
[time=1551] You know, and I get confused sometimes because on the one hand, I'm a member here and it's my, I need to pay my fair share of the electric bill.
[time=1562] And on the other hand, I want to give an offering to my God.
[time=1565] And those things get muddy sometimes for me.
[time=1568] I remember years ago, I figured out what one-twelve hundredths,
[time=1574] there were twelve hundred people here at the time.
[time=1576] And then I realized I had four people in my family.
[time=1578] So then I figured out what four-twelve hundredths was.
[time=1581] And I knew that was my minimum.
[time=1583] Four-twelve hundredths of the budget.
[time=1586] I'm not suggesting that that's what you ought to do when you think about how to give.
[time=1591] But I wouldn't suggest that you pray.
[time=1593] And just decide to live in the tension that that brings.
[time=1598] I think God wants us there.
[time=1601] And pray, please, for the elders as we're trying our best
[time=1607] to figure out how to oversee and shepherd our church.
[time=1613] So I'm just asking you to please do that.
[time=1617] Lord, help us, please.
[time=1621] We don't want to spend any money in the wrong way.
[time=1628] We want to use your resources wisely.
[time=1632] God, please rain down wisdom on this church, please.
[time=1639] And we give you praise.
[time=1642] In Christ's name, amen.
[time=1648] In 1975, not only did I hear that sermon, but a guy gave me this red Bible then.
[time=1657] It's an NASB.
[time=1658] And so when I want to follow Kelly and do what he's doing, I use an NASB.
[time=1663] And I remember this guy gave me this Bible.
[time=1667] His name is John Willett.
[time=1668] And I went home to our apartment and I started reading it.
[time=1674] And I read for two days straight until I had the New Testament read.
[time=1678] Just every time I had a chance to read, I just couldn't quit reading it.
[time=1681] It just made such clear sense.
[time=1684] And it was so much fun.
[time=1688] And it still is.
[time=1689] I was thinking this week I picked this up.
[time=1692] And I love this old red Bible.
[time=1695] It's a hardback.
[time=1696] You know, it's a cheap one as far as money goes.
[time=1702] But it's incredibly valuable to me.
[time=1713] Please stand.
[time=1714] We'll read Ephesians 6, 10 through 18 together.
[time=1722] Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.
[time=1728] Put on the full armor of God that you may be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.
[time=1741] For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers and against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in heavenly places.
[time=1757] Therefore, keep up the full take up, the full armor of God, that you may be able to risk in the evil day, and having done everything to stand firm.
[time=1769] Stand firm, therefore, having girded your loins with truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[time=1783] In addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil one, and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.
[time=1799] With all prayer and petition, pray it all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints.
[time=1813] Father in Heaven, I thank you that we're talking about your armor.
[time=1821] I'm so grateful that it's by your power, by your Spirit, not my might, not my power.
[time=1831] I thank you that we can trust in you clothing us with your armor,
[time=1838] and I pray, Lord, that every person in this room would sense the reality of that possibility that they'd be clothed
[time=1849] in your armor.
[time=1851] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1854] You may be seated.
[time=1858] What I'd like for you to do this morning is I'd like for you to think of the godliest person you know or you know of.
[time=1874] A person who's truthful.
[time=1876] A person who's obedient.
[time=1879] A person who's at peace.
[time=1882] A person that's secure and confident.
[time=1886] A person full of faith.
[time=1891] A person who's wise and knowledgeable.
[time=1895] Think about the godliest person you know or know of.
[time=1906] I'd like to give the processors a little time, you know.
[time=1918] Can you imagine that being you?
[time=1927] And just can you imagine if several people thought of you,
[time=1935] if you thought of you, if God thought of you that way, can you imagine that person being you
[time=1950] that can be you?
[time=1955] Maybe not the godliest.
[time=1958] Not the number one, because I don't know that there is one, but that person, the way I describe that person, the thought of that person.
[time=1970] Can you imagine the reality that that could be you personally?
[time=1980] It can.
[time=1986] Finally, he says.
[time=1989] Finally, that's a really good word.
[time=1991] Paul writes to the Ephesians, he's been telling them, the first three chapters we find out about who we are in Christ.
[time=1998] Incredible.
[time=2000] Who we are in Christ.
[time=2003] And then we have some chapters that describe how we can behave in certain roles that we have as human beings in Christ.
[time=2013] And now he gets to the end of this letter to the Ephesians, and Paul says, finally.
[time=2019] And really, it's an incredible word.
[time=2021] It's not finally like, and this is just the last thing, it's finally like Paul Harvey.
[time=2028] And here's the rest of the story.
[time=2031] Really big, important kind of fills in the gaps.
[time=2037] Finally, here's the rest of the story.
[time=2045] Finally, he says.
[time=2049] Be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.
[time=2055] Ephesians, don't be strong in yourselves.
[time=2057] Be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.
[time=2062] Put on the full armor of God that you may be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.
[time=2067] He's scheming, you know.
[time=2070] This whole world culture is a scheme.
[time=2078] For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this present darkness.
[time=2086] Whoops, I added present in there, isn't that interesting?
[time=2089] If you read that book, this present darkness, that had my attention.
[time=2094] In this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[time=2106] The hellied last week helped us experience the reality that that's taking place.
[time=2112] Are you aware of the spiritual battle in which you're engaged?
[time=2118] You are in it.
[time=2120] If you're not aware of it, you're losing.
[time=2127] We are engaged in a spiritual battle.
[time=2130] He's scheming, and the world culture schemes, and your own flesh schemes, they're all the enemy, you know.
[time=2138] Is scheming against us, and if we aren't aware of it, and sometimes it's so subtle that it's important for us to be in the Word to be aware of it.
[time=2152] But we're in a raging, raging war.
[time=2158] One of the places in the scripture that teach about it, I just love this part.
[time=2163] Daniel chapter 10, I've probably said it to you before, because I love it so much, but Daniel chapter 10, Daniel has been praying for help, and a messenger could even be Christ, comes to Daniel and says to Daniel, "For 21 days since you first prayed, I've been wanting to come, but I was holding off the Prince of Persia, often description of Satan.
[time=2193] I've been engaged in a battle holding off the Prince of Persia until Michael, one of the superior angels, came and relieved me so I could come to you."
[time=2206] That's what was going on.
[time=2211] I love it too in that chapter.
[time=2212] He says to Daniel, "Oh man, highly esteemed."
[time=2218] That one, I've thought, I wonder what it would be like to be called highly esteemed by someone from the heavenlies.
[time=2231] There's a battle going on.
[time=2233] He was holding off the Prince of Persia.
[time=2236] That stuff's happening.
[time=2238] We're engaged in a war, and too often I think we don't realize it.
[time=2246] We're aware of it.
[time=2248] And Paul's saying to the Ephesians, "Beware of that." Therefore, since that's a reality, since that's taking place, now therefore, verse 13, "Take up the full armor of God." God's armor, just can't say that often enough today.
[time=2266] Not my armor, not your armor, not the one you make or manufacture.
[time=2272] God's armor, take up God's armor that you may be able to resist in the evil day.
[time=2279] We're in evil days.
[time=2283] And having done everything, I just don't know how to show this.
[time=2287] But somehow you've got to realize what he wants us to do is stand.
[time=2292] He wants us to take a stand against those evil forces,
[time=2298] and we need armor to stand against that.
[time=2302] It's not that we are to attack.
[time=2306] It's not that we're to retreat.
[time=2308] He says three times emphatically.
[time=2310] Paul says to the Ephesians, "Make sure you stand."
[time=2318] Don't be weak.
[time=2322] Take my power on.
[time=2325] You see, my might, and stand against it.
[time=2334] Stand firm there for verse 14.
[time=2337] Having girded, I like girded.
[time=2341] We don't say girded all that often.
[time=2345] Having girded, having already girded, having girded your loins with truth, he says.
[time=2353] In those days, Roman soldiers, the Roman soldiers, most of them were these short things, but they also had these longer things.
[time=2361] And a lot of people that lived in those days wore longer clothing.
[time=2367] And in order to do something active or to stand, and they'd pull it up and they'd tuck it in, they'd wrap it around, they would gird themselves, gird themselves so that they could take a good position.
[time=2381] I love it in 1 Peter 1, verse 13.
[time=2384] It says, "Gird up the loins," this is King James, I think.
[time=2387] "Gird up the loins of your mind." I like that imagery.
[time=2392] This is, "Gird yourself with the truth." Are you wrapping the truth around you?
[time=2399] It says, "Having done that," he says to the Ephesians.
[time=2402] "Having already girded your loins with the truth."
[time=2410] Next, he says, "Having put on the breastplate of righteousness,"
[time=2420] I like this.
[time=2423] It's this breastplate.
[time=2425] It protects my heart, my bowels, the seat of my emotions,
[time=2431] my soul, my heart, my mind, my thinking, even brains a part of your heart.
[time=2438] There's this image of this breastplate of righteousness that protects me, protects my heart.
[time=2450] Christ's righteousness, His righteousness saved my soul
[time=2460] and gave me the power to put on His righteousness.
[time=2468] He died on the cross so that I could put on His righteousness.
[time=2475] And in His power, I can be obedient, righteous,
[time=2486] and my breastplate gives me protection to do that and to be who I am in Christ.
[time=2493] There's this breastplate of protection that is about righteousness, His and mine.
[time=2503] You're putting on or this says, "Having put on." So that means in His righteousness, I have righteousness.
[time=2518] Wow.
[time=2521] Are you seeing that expressed?
[time=2523] Are you seeing the obedience that comes out of His righteousness being lived out in your life?
[time=2530] There's evidence of a breastplate of righteousness in your life.
[time=2536] There should be.
[time=2542] Having girded my loins with truth, total reality,
[time=2549] everything that's true, everything natural that's true, everything that's revealed in His Word, that's true.
[time=2559] Every single thing that's true, wrap that around you, then put on that breastplate of His righteousness and my ability to be obedient.
[time=2569] Then having done that, it says, "And having shod your feet with the preparation." I'll get this. This is so interesting.
[time=2579] I hadn't really thought about this much before until a couple weeks ago when I was studying this, having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[time=2596] There's preparation for this battle.
[time=2602] And it's the gospel.
[time=2604] It's the good news that brings me peace
[time=2610] that prepares me to stand in this battle.
[time=2615] This isn't about me going out and evangelizing.
[time=2618] I have heard that taught that way a couple times.
[time=2620] I've never really understood that.
[time=2622] This is about me experiencing peace.
[time=2625] I've been shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace so I can stand.
[time=2631] Are you experiencing peace that way today?
[time=2634] Has the gospel brought you the kind of peace?
[time=2639] That makes you go, "Oh my, this is different."
[time=2645] It's the peace that passes understanding.
[time=2648] You're in these circumstances that would bring the lack of peace, but you experience peace.
[time=2655] Sometimes you experience peace because you know this is temporary, but the peace you have is forever.
[time=2664] So have you been shod with the preparation for standing
[time=2672] that comes from the gospel of peace?
[time=2677] That's why, you know, I ask you when I describe that person, I said, "Are they truthful?
[time=2683] Do they have an attitude of truthfulness?
[time=2686] Do they really love truth that person that you were thinking about?" So if they were obedient, do they have a breastplate of righteousness?
[time=2696] I ask you if they were at peace, they were experiencing peaceful life because feet shod
[time=2706] with the preparation of the gospel of peace experienced peace.
[time=2711] Then he goes on and he says, "In addition to all,
[time=2717] now he's done with the halving put on, having past tense."
[time=2723] Now he says, "Take up." These next three parts of the armor of God, Paul tells the Ephesians, "Now take this up." He says, "Having girded your wounds with the truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, having shodged your feet.
[time=2740] Now taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to distinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil one." I looked at all the Roman soldier parts that you do often when you study Ephesians 6.
[time=2757] The couple that I want to spend time on this one, this is one of them, this shield of faith.
[time=2764] There were a couple of shields that they used.
[time=2766] One was this little two and a half foot in diameter circle.
[time=2769] You've seen that.
[time=2771] They actually would strap it here and here, both places.
[time=2774] That thing would be available to fend off blows from other people's swords.
[time=2780] Then there's another shield that's this one.
[time=2784] It's the four and a half foot or five foot high shield.
[time=2788] And it's a two and a half to three foot wide shield.
[time=2792] And it's the shield that they kept in front of them to fend off everything.
[time=2798] And it would protect their whole body.
[time=2800] That's this shield.
[time=2801] Paul says, "Now take up this shield that protects all of you."
[time=2809] And the shield of faith has the ability to protect you
[time=2815] from the flaming missiles that Satan will fire at you.
[time=2820] Now those missiles take different forms in different people's lives.
[time=2827] Just some examples.
[time=2832] Some people, matter of fact, all of these probably impact all of us just some more than others.
[time=2842] Some people, their missile comes through him causing you to fear.
[time=2850] Sometimes the missiles bring fear, and Paul says God's shield of faith
[time=2859] can extinguish the missiles that are flaming that come in the form of bringing fear about in you.
[time=2867] You do not have to be afraid.
[time=2869] Our selfishness often comes out of our fear.
[time=2873] Sometimes.
[time=2875] Sometimes those missiles can come in the form of trying to get me to be angry about things that I shouldn't be angry about.
[time=2882] Some things I should be angry about.
[time=2884] But sometimes those flames come and they're trying to, he's trying to cause you or me to be angry in a way that is not God honoring.
[time=2893] That shield of faith can extinguish those flaming missiles.
[time=2899] Sometimes, some of us, our selfishness kind of exudes out of our despair.
[time=2904] We're just sort of victims.
[time=2906] We're thinking about what's been done to us all our life, and that shield of faith can protect us from that.
[time=2914] Some of us, here's a fourth one I'll stop after this.
[time=2917] Some of us, our selfishness comes in the form of just plain foolishness and pleasure seeking.
[time=2927] Denny's helped me understand that about me.
[time=2931] I'm a person.
[time=2933] The darts of fear don't do too much to me.
[time=2936] I mean, I'm sure they could and they do sometimes.
[time=2939] The anger ones and the despair ones, the insecurity, that's not where I struggle most.
[time=2947] I struggle most with thinking I am in charge and I can go have fun.
[time=2953] And so, I need a shield of faith that will protect me from the flaming missiles
[time=2961] that tempt me into pleasing myself.
[time=2968] I'm sure you relate to those.
[time=2972] What a shield of faith.
[time=2974] It's his.
[time=2975] Faith comes by hearing, hearing by the Word of God.
[time=2979] Faith also comes through experiencing his provision.
[time=2982] I love it when my sister Lori talks about his provision in the past.
[time=2985] We've looked back with lots of people to see how he's been faithful.
[time=2990] He is faithful.
[time=2991] He's the faithful one.
[time=2993] If I have his shield of faith, it will extinguish those flaming missiles.
[time=3000] My faith needs to be increased by taking his faithful shield.
[time=3012] In addition to taking up the shield of faith, he wants me to take up, and he wants you to take up the helmet of salvation.
[time=3020] You notice, I called that person that you were thinking about faithful and I also called them secure.
[time=3028] There's a helmet of salvation.
[time=3030] I want to ask you a question.
[time=3031] Answer this.
[time=3032] Whose helmet is it?
[time=3039] That's God's helmet.
[time=3042] I'm putting on God's armor.
[time=3045] My salvation is him.
[time=3050] I can't earn it. I can only put his on.
[time=3058] People who have the helmet of salvation firmly planted over their doubting thinking are secure in him.
[time=3072] Now, if my salvation's got anything to do with me, I better doubt it.
[time=3079] I'm working out the reality of my salvation in fear and trembling.
[time=3085] I'm not in fear and trembling working out my salvation.
[time=3089] I'm working out the reality of my salvation, this helmet that he put on me through the blood of Christ.
[time=3096] And now I can work it out because I am saved.
[time=3103] It's his helmet.
[time=3106] And then from the helmet of salvation, he goes to the sword of the spirit,
[time=3117] which is the Word of God.
[time=3119] Here's the other Roman tool that I want to tell you about.
[time=3123] You know, there are all kinds of swords.
[time=3126] You remember a long time ago I did a sermon on swords because I did Hebrews 4, 11, 12, and 13, and I talked about going to the collar of the guy at the mall and asking him to describe a double-edged sword for me because the Word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any double-edged sword.
[time=3142] There are lots of swords. There are double-edged swords.
[time=3144] There are long swords. Remember, you've probably seen the ones where it takes two hands and the guys are doing that stuff and they did that for years.
[time=3150] And then they realized the Romans got real smart and they developed this little, like, two-foot sword, two-and-a-half foot sword, and they kept it handy.
[time=3159] It just was in a sheath on their side.
[time=3161] And when the other guys are doing this with their big thing, they killed them.
[time=3168] I was thinking, what's the deal with that?
[time=3170] Why would Paul specifically use that sword?
[time=3173] Well, I think that something to do with proximity, availability, you can use it.
[time=3180] And I just encourage you to think about the sword of the spirit, the Word of God.
[time=3186] Consider knowing it so that it's in close proximity.
[time=3195] Hide it in your heart so that it's in close proximity.
[time=3201] Carry it on your body.
[time=3203] I used to, when I first started to think about this a long time ago, I put a Bible in my glove compartment of my cars.
[time=3210] I put a Bible in my desk drawer.
[time=3213] I actually put one in my golf bag.
[time=3216] I just had Bibles everywhere, and I kept one in my pocket all the time.
[time=3220] And so, if somebody needed a Bible, I could give them a Bible.
[time=3224] If they needed to know what the Bible said, I had it in proximity.
[time=3228] I'm just saying the spirit, the sword of the spirit, the Word of God,
[time=3234] needs to be in proximity to you.
[time=3239] Now, hopefully you are hiding it in your heart.
[time=3245] It's a tool that's God's.
[time=3262] Verse 18, "With all prayer and petition, pray at all times in the spirit,
[time=3272] and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance
[time=3278] and petition for all the saints." I'm hoping that you are standing firm and praying for me
[time=3294] the way I'm standing firm and praying for you actually better than I am.
[time=3300] I'm hoping you're doing it a lot better than I am.
[time=3305] We need to pray for each other.
[time=3311] Now, I've said, "Can you imagine a lot this morning?"
[time=3318] I hope you can.
[time=3321] You should be girded with truth.
[time=3325] You should just be in love with truth.
[time=3328] You should speak the truth in love.
[time=3330] You should answer truthfully.
[time=3332] You should have an attitude of truthfulness.
[time=3335] That's who God's called us to.
[time=3337] He is truth. When we're girded with truth, He is our truth.
[time=3346] I'm hoping that you really can picture a breastplate of righteousness where you're living a more and more obedient life in His righteousness.
[time=3355] I'm hoping that you do understand that your feet are shod with the gospel of peace and that you can be at peace in this spiritual warfare that's taking place
[time=3366] and in ways that you're experiencing it in real life and flesh and blood.
[time=3372] I'm hoping that you do have a shield of faith that you realize is big and that you're aware of the darts that you need to ward off with His shield of faith.
[time=3383] His helmet of salvation.
[time=3388] His sword of the Spirit, His word.
[time=3393] Can you imagine that?
[time=3396] Please imagine the truth of that.
[time=3400] That's who God wants us to be.
[time=3404] The person you thought of and more.
[time=3409] As you pursue being more like Christ, you can be that person and more.
[time=3426] We can't do that, Lord, other than by your might, your power, your strength.
[time=3434] We can make all the lists and choices that we want to.
[time=3440] If we aren't in Christ, empowered by your Spirit, aware of your presence,
[time=3447] pursuing your perfection, wanting to please you.
[time=3451] If we're doing it on our own, Lord, we cannot do it.
[time=3454] We know that. We'll fail.
[time=3455] So we collectively are begging you to put your armor on us
[time=3463] and we want to put it on.
[time=3468] Thank you for the part you've done already, so grateful.
[time=3474] Please empower us, Lord.
[time=3476] Please help us.
[time=3478] Thank you so much for your armor.
[time=3486] In Christ's name I pray. Amen.
