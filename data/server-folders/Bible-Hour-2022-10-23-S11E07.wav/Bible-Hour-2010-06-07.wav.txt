[time=220] So God Himself made us to praise Him, and He also enthrones our praises and
[time=230] inhabits our praises. And another observation this morning when we declare together, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, it represents this idea that our praise is uncontainable. And when we love God desperately with an undivided heart, we just explode with praise. It's our response to Him. Our praise must be
[time=250] declared. The psalmist and the scriptures all together say that praise praise the Lord exactly 60 times. And it's a command and a truth that when the people of God see what He does, they praise Him. And then others look on and they observe the praise of the people of God and it becomes contagious. C.S. Lewis
[time=270] has an interesting quote about the praises of God becoming contagious. And he just observes human nature in people and C.S. Lewis says this, men spontaneously praise what they value. We do it all the time. Oh, isn't that cool?
[time=283] I love that. That was so great. Did you see that? So they spontaneously invite others to join them in that praise when they say how cool it is or how awesome it is. C.S. Lewis doesn't say cool or awesome. He says this, isn't she lovely?
[time=297] Wasn't it glorious? Don't you think that magnificent? We don't really talk like C.S. Lewis does. But in this way, the psalmist is telling everyone to praise
[time=308] God. And he says that people do it without even thinking about it. That we just say what we love and then we invite others to join us in appreciating what we love. So this morning, as we praise God, let's declare it together and let's understand that we're inviting anybody in this room who doesn't understand the greatness of our God to see us praising him and know that he is awesome and he is lovely and he is excellent and he is praise worthy and that's why we're doing what we're doing. So let's praise him in another way.
[time=352] Oh, Sporey, joy and crown.
[time=382] There's Lord Jesus, Ferris, Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature. Oh, thou of God and
[time=402] man the son. He will I cherish. He will lie on her.
[time=420] How my soul's glory, joy and crown.
[time=438] There are the meadows, there's still the wood and land. Oh, through the blue, mean God loves me.
[time=460] Jesus is the spirit. Jesus is the bearer. Jesus is the bearer.
[time=473] He makes the whole whole heart to see.
[time=484] You are there, there is something thousand. I've heard that all I've ever seen.
[time=496] Yeah, you are a fighter then the writers start in heaven.
[time=502] Jesus has everything to me. Oh, Jesus has everything to me.
[time=513] Sing fair is the sunshine. Ferris still the moonlight.
[time=526] Hand all the tears, please stop the people.
[time=537] But my Jesus shines brighter. Jesus shines cooler than all the angels have.
[time=554] Hand all the tears, please stop the people.
[time=574] And the writers start in heaven. Oh, Jesus, you have everything to me.
[time=584] Yeah, Jesus, you have everything to me.
[time=590] But far than the fair is something thousand. I've heard that all I've ever seen.
[time=601] Oh, you are brighter than the writers start in heaven.
[time=608] Jesus, you have everything to me. Oh, Jesus, you have everything to me.
[time=618] Sing beautiful Savior. Beautiful Savior. Lord of all nation, son of God.
[time=636] And son of man. Glory and honor, grace and oration.
[time=655] Now and forever more, be the Lord.
[time=669] [AMEN]
[time=677] You could be seated again.
[time=681] So the praise of God is uncontainable. We just respond to who He is.
[time=686] Another aspect of praise that I think God shows us in the book of Psalms is that it's a weapon of choice.
[time=692] In the last couple of weeks we've been talking about the armor of God.
[time=695] And I think Steve mentioned last week a truth that we have to remember that that armor of God is in an exhaustive list.
[time=702] Because we see in Psalm 149 that the praises of God are referred to as a weapon.
[time=707] If you look at the first, well verse 6, excuse me of Psalm 149, it says, "Let the praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand."
[time=717] When I initially read this verse I thought it was two separate things, songs and swords.
[time=722] But it's not the case. The word "and" is actually describing the second function of the praise.
[time=727] The first function of the praise is that it's in the mouths of the people of God and the second function of praise is that it's a sword that is sharp.
[time=736] And the psalms are full of this great figurative imagery of praises actually becoming swords.
[time=742] And it's not a literal sense, but it is true that the praises of God are a weapon.
[time=746] And look at the amazing, powerful things that the praises of God did in Psalm 146.
[time=752] They executed vengeance on the nations.
[time=755] They punished the peoples, the praises of God bound kings with chains and the nobles with fetters of iron and the praises of God.
[time=763] They executed on the peoples the judgment that was written.
[time=767] And the psalmist says this is an honor for all his godly ones.
[time=771] So the praises of God are powerful songs and lyrics that complement and ascribe glory to God are powerful,
[time=778] powerful weapons in the midst of the battle we fight every day against the world system and the enemy and our flesh.
[time=786] So this morning we're going to sing a song that says I will sing praise no weapon formed against me can remain to remind us this morning that the praises of God are a powerful weapon of choice.
[time=816] This is my prayer in the desert when all that's within me feels right.
[time=827] This is my prayer in my hunger and need.
[time=831] My God is the God who proclaims.
[time=835] And this is my prayer in the fire in weakness or trial or pain.
[time=844] There is a faith group, a more worth and no.
[time=848] So refine me Lord through the flame.
[time=852] I will bring praise.
[time=858] No weapon formed against me shall remain.
[time=862] I will rejoice.
[time=864] I will declare that is what victory is here.
[time=874] This is my prayer in the battle when triumph is still on its way.
[time=887] I am a conqueror and co-hair with prize.
[time=891] So furlorn is promise I'll stand.
[time=895] I will bring praise.
[time=899] No weapon formed against me shall remain.
[time=903] I will rejoice.
[time=905] I will declare.
[time=907] God is my victory in He is here.
[time=913] All my life.
[time=917] In every season you are still God.
[time=921] I have a reason to sing.
[time=930] Sing that again.
[time=931] All my life.
[time=934] In every season you are still God.
[time=939] I have a reason to sing.
[time=948] All my life.
[time=952] In every season you are still God.
[time=956] I have a reason to sing.
[time=965] All my life.
[time=969] In every season you are still God.
[time=973] I have a reason to sing.
[time=982] I will bring praise.
[time=988] No weapon formed against me shall remain.
[time=992] I will rejoice.
[time=994] I will declare.
[time=996] God is my victory in He is here.
[time=1002] He is here.
[time=1016] This is my prayer in the harvest.
[time=1022] When I know I am filled to be emptied again.
[time=1033] The seed I received I will sow.
[time=1046] Well hello again and good morning welcome to the broadcast.
[time=1050] I am really thankful that you have tuned in and I want to welcome you to the summer here at Black Hawk.
[time=1055] June is upon us and there are so many things that God has allowed us to prepare for and plan for this summer.
[time=1062] I can't wait over the next couple of weeks to tell you about many of them.
[time=1066] But today I want to tell you about one thing and that is our summer teaching series.
[time=1070] I hope that you will come and join us personally and take it in.
[time=1074] I really do.
[time=1076] If you can't make it personally I hope you will watch the broadcast each week.
[time=1080] 14 weeks all the way to the middle of September and we have entitled it lessons learned.
[time=1086] Lessons learned from the life of and then you just kind of fill in the blank with 14 different men and women from the very pages of scripture.
[time=1095] Real people who experienced real challenges and I think from those real experiences we can learn
[time=1103] some very real and honest lessons.
[time=1105] And I can't wait for you to hear what we've got on tap for you today.
[time=1109] We start this series out looking at the life of David and there was no way we could capture all of David's lessons that we could learn in one message.
[time=1119] And so I focused on the end of David's life.
[time=1122] There's an amazing little verse in 1 Chronicles 28 where David's coming to the end of his life.
[time=1127] These were David's final words to his son before David left before David passed away.
[time=1133] And it was a really significant day for me this last Sunday.
[time=1137] The message you're about to see.
[time=1139] It was my sons in essence last Sunday.
[time=1143] He's heading off to college soon and there were many in the room that day who were graduating.
[time=1148] It was our graduation Sunday for Black Hawk Christian High School and many other students at many other high schools in the area who were a part of our Black Hawk College.
[time=1156] So I just had a chance to speak from my heart and from the very words of David to those who were leaving and to parents.
[time=1164] And I hope it's something that will encourage you.
[time=1167] I hope it's something that will inspire and remind you of how very important it is.
[time=1173] How very significant it is that we allow God to be in his proper place in our life.
[time=1180] I hope the message will make that clear to you.
[time=1183] Thank you so much for being a part of our family.
[time=1186] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=1188] I hope as we often say that you'll come and join us we'd love to see you soon more than anything.
[time=1193] I hope this summer you'll learn with us lessons that can truly and absolutely change your life.
[time=1200] I'm looking forward to it.
[time=1202] We hope to see you over the summer months.
[time=1204] God bless.
[time=1205] The psalmist describes seasons of the soul and in particular in Psalm 103 the psalmist actually has to command his own soul to praise God.
[time=1215] He's at a point where he just doesn't quite feel it or it just doesn't necessarily make sense in light of his circumstances to continue to praise.
[time=1224] And so the psalmist says this in 103.
[time=1227] Bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget none of his benefits.
[time=1237] And there are times in our lives when we need to summon our souls to praise when we need to command our hearts to obey even when it doesn't feel like obeying.
[time=1247] So we want to do that together this morning and we're going to sing another song together.
[time=1251] And I'd like you to stand to your feet and perhaps this morning you find yourself in a season where you're not feeling like praising and use the lyrics of this song to summon your soul to praise.
[time=1280] Bless it be your name in the land that is plentiful where your streams of a blunt and slow blessed be your name.
[time=1297] Bless it be your name when I'm found in the desert place though I walk through the wilderness blessed be your name.
[time=1314] Blessing you pour out out turn back to praise when the darkness closes it Lord still I will say bless it be the name of the Lord bless it be your name.
[time=1337] Bless it be the name of the Lord bless it be your glorious name.
[time=1349] Bless it be your name when the sun shining down on me when the world's all as it should be.
[time=1360] Bless it be your name.
[time=1365] Bless it be your name on the road marked with suffering though there's pain in the offering blessed be your name.
[time=1381] Every blessing you pour out out turn back to praise when the darkness closes it Lord still I will say bless it be the name of the Lord bless it be your name.
[time=1404] Bless it be the name of the Lord bless it be your glorious name.
[time=1414] Oh you give and take away you give and take away my heart will choose the same.
[time=1445] Bless it be your name bless it be the name of the Lord bless it be your name.
[time=1456] Bless it be the name of the Lord bless it be your name.
[time=1466] Bless it be your name bless it be the name of the Lord bless it be your glorious name.
[time=1491] Open your Bibles if you would this morning they gave me this table and the and the stools here this morning which I always think is a great idea I just I never use it so sorry.
[time=1502] I think I'll probably end up standing the whole time this morning open your Bibles the first Chronicles 28 first Chronicles 28 we'll get there in just a minute we begin this morning with the story of David what an incredible story maybe it was the fact that David was his father's
[time=1520] last choice maybe it was his uncanny way with a harp and a slingshot maybe it was his unwillingness to kill a madman because he feared God even more or surely it was his ability to dance down the streets of Jerusalem then again perhaps it was his shocking humanity
[time=1542] and the resulting suggestion that we cannot out send God's ability to forgive can't quite put my finger on it Beth Moore writes in her book a heart like his I can't quite put my finger on why an ancient shepherd boy king has so captured my imagination over and over again through the years I simply like him
[time=1566] his story gives me hope terrifies me into fresh reverence I see so many things in him I wish I had and so many other things in him I'm scared to death I do have anybody want to say amen to that
[time=1581] all you need to relate to David is membership in the human race no matter how familiar you are with the biblical account of his life I believe in the pages to come you'll be stirred
[time=1594] shot amazed and forced to think a few hard and possibly new thoughts his story I'll end this part with this his story is proof once again the truth is far more intriguing than fiction
[time=1611] there are many of you in the room who are really familiar with the story of David you've heard David stories from the day you were in Sunday school you're very aware of his incredible journey through boyhood and young manhood and adulthood
[time=1627] and all that transpired in this amazing life of one known as King David there are others of you in the room who possibly have no clue who I'm talking about this morning and I love that I love that you're all here some of you understanding this story already others of you looking for new insights into a man whose life I believe we can learn from
[time=1648] so whether you know about him or not whether you're very familiar with his story or just kind of tuning in here this morning for the first time let me just give you a little backdrop let me read to you if I can just some notes that I made some things I put down
[time=1661] I think there'll be some pictures on the screen as we make our way through kind of the life of David in just a few minutes he rose David did he rose from a common forgotten shepherd boy
[time=1672] remember the dad was bringing all the brothers out before the prophet to see which one might become king he hadn't even remembered David was out in the field tending the flocks he had been forgotten
[time=1686] he rose from a common forgotten shepherd boy to become the king and leader of Israel early on we watch with amazement as he kills beasts in the field in a determined effort to care for his father's flock
[time=1703] he single handedly as he gets older he single handedly slays the Philistine giant Goliath as he defends the honor of Israel and the name of his precious god
[time=1716] as time goes by and the evidence is his incredible leadership ability he executes wartime strategy and evidence is a strength and a courage that not only wins battles but saves a kingdom
[time=1729] he stands strong for everything good and of God he dances without shame and without clothes in the streets of Jerusalem out of a deep and passionate desire to worship and make much of his lord whom he loved deeply
[time=1752] and he and he watches from a balcony a naked woman bathe when he should have been out to battle and with the subsequent lust that fills his heart he has her Bathsheba he has her summon to his room so he can sleep with her
[time=1777] when pregnancy is the result he murders her husband in an attempt to cover it up and in the days and years that follow he experiences a level of family heartache, loss and disappointment may be rivaled only by Job
[time=1800] you see David lives a life of honor and service to God holiness and wisdom faithfulness and sacrifice and within the confines of that same life
[time=1816] within the confines of that same existence he experiences darkness and despair he chooses immorality and utter cruelty he exhibits pride arrogance rebellion and idolatry
[time=1833] and yet somehow somehow at the end of the day and that's where we find him here in 1 Chronicles 28 we've fast forwarded if you will to the end of the story
[time=1849] today we come to the final chapter the final page if you will of David's life and as you and I find him here at the end of it all somehow
[time=1862] he finds peace with God continues to serve God with a whole and faithful heart and is by all accounts described even by God himself to be a man after God's what?
[time=1874] to be a man after God's own heart which literally translated would mean a man this man who we just learned about in 3 minutes there you would literally translate that to be a man like God David
[time=1897] so with all that as a backdrop what lesson was I going to pull out for us today and I have to admit I was a little bit subjective in all of this thought about him as a boy thought about him as a young man thought about his kingship thought about his battles
[time=1917] but I was drawn I think to the end of 1 Chronicles 28 because you see at the end of 1 Chronicles 28 David is saying goodbye to his son David knew that he was going to die
[time=1931] David knew that Solomon was going to go forward in fact we come to a point here that was kind of unique in the history of Israel David was no longer king alive but no longer king Solomon had taken the throne
[time=1943] and so as David realizes that his time his time of living was coming to an end and he would soon say goodbye to his son he decided to say something to his son
[time=1958] and there are many of you in the room this morning there's a list of graduates in the bulletin today there are many of you in the room this morning who have sons and daughters who are getting ready to leave
[time=1971] I'm one of those I have a son who in about a month I'll say goodbye to for a few weeks I'm sure and I'll figure out a way to get up the Lansing but it's a significant time for many of us
[time=1985] and there are others of you in the room who are preparing for that time it's coming next year or in 2 or 3 years there are others of you in the room who may not be in the midst of saying goodbye to a son or daughter but the things David says to Solomon for you you would be wise to listen to
[time=2003] as I think about graduation Sunday we'll be here tonight at 6 as I mentioned in my email this week I'd love for all of you to come it's one of the most significant impactful ministries of our church I'm so thankful for what God has done in and through our school
[time=2017] a Black Hawk Christian high school graduation is a tremendous ceremony you're welcome to be here but as I thought about saying goodbye to our kids I think I was drawn to what David said to Solomon here as he prepared to say goodbye
[time=2031] and let me just read this for you it's on our screen first Chronicles 28 29 first Chronicles 28 29 it says this as for you my son Solomon know the God of your father
[time=2047] and some translations that may read acknowledge him as for you my son Solomon know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart serve him with a whole heart it says here in the NASB and a willing mind
[time=2065] for the Lord searches all hearts and understands every intent of the thoughts if you seek him he's not playing hide and go seek if you seek him he will let you find him
[time=2079] that encourage anybody in the room if you seek him he will let you find him but if you forsake him Solomon he will reject you forever consider now verse 10 for the Lord has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary
[time=2096] be courageous Solomon and act David gave his son three critical directives life principles that he prayed and hoped Solomon would follow and take to heart let me give you these three this morning let's just talk about them briefly
[time=2114] a father's final words to his son and words I think all of us will benefit from he says to Solomon as he prepares to leave he says number one and you can write this down acknowledge God
[time=2128] acknowledge God in the NASB there it said know him I think in the NIV and other translations it may say acknowledge the Hebrew word there would really lend itself to a to an acknowledging of God interpretation here's what that word means
[time=2145] that word acknowledge God means to declare outwardly and accept inwardly his authority his authority what's going on here is we're declaring the authority of God declare outwardly except inwardly his authority over every part of your life
[time=2167] why so important well because remember with authority this is good really simple but good remember with authority comes submission you understand this is true right come on you know every single time you see a police officer while you're out and about
[time=2189] you know every single time you see him the first thing you do is the same thing I do it just oh wow fast am I going is my seat belt on there's just this sense of that's authority and he's the man and I better be straight here does that make sense I can walk into our living room
[time=2213] Jake and Wesley or Jake and Maddie have an argument because they're about to take five times to do something and he's not doing it and I walk in and he sees me and she looks at me and he just goes and does
[time=2225] what they've been begging him to do for 15 minutes because authority has entered and with authority comes submission and David who's been through all he's been through says to his son son this is really important
[time=2242] acknowledge God in your life as your authority it is a word that carries with it the acknowledgement of authority every morning I can see David saying this to Solomon I can
[time=2260] certainly see myself saying this to my own son many of you can see yourself saying this to your kids and whether they're going off to college or you know in sixth grade I think it's all very applicable
[time=2273] every I can see it every morning of every day in that new dorm room son you should stop and before you go anywhere before you do anything you should say to God God you are my leader
[time=2289] you are in charge of my life you are my authority and I will follow you and I will follow no one else when it comes to the matters of life when it comes to the issues of devotion when it comes to those choices that I will have to make day in and day out
[time=2311] David's words to Solomon our words to our kids acknowledge God establish him as the authority in your life I love Joshua 24 15 you can write that down Joshua 24 15 choose for yourselves this day
[time=2327] choose for yourselves every single day whom you will serve who you will live in authority under who it is that will call the shots for you who isn't at the end of the day that you will ultimately submit to and David just pleads with his son Solomon acknowledge God
[time=2352] and so kids we plead in that same direction this morning we invite you to the kind of life that God designed for you a life that you will experience to the fullest when you acknowledge him and him alone
[time=2370] remember this and we'll move on remember this if you don't if you don't acknowledge him as your authority each and every day if there isn't a pretty consistent pretty constant acknowledging of his authority in your life on a daily basis
[time=2393] then understand that then you head out into that day without having acknowledged him then what you've done is acknowledged the other side
[time=2405] if you've not placed yourself under his authority then you've opened yourself up to the enemies authority the enemies attacked the enemy's perspective the enemy's ideas the enemy's temptations
[time=2420] does that make sense we don't go through our days not under authority that's not the question the question is which one will you submit to and so we with David we plead with our sons and daughters acknowledge the Lord as yours
[time=2440] number two serve God serve God with a whole and devoted heart you see it right there in the passage as for you my son Solomon know the God of your father acknowledge him and serve him with a whole heart
[time=2458] serve God sons and daughters as you leave this place with a whole and devoted heart be wholeheartedly devoted to him let me read this to you if I can again I would highly highly recommend this book it's called a heart like his by Beth Moore
[time=2480] and it says here under this idea of serving him with a whole hearted devotion I love the picture that this paints the Hebrew word for a whole hearted is Shalem S-H-A-L-E-M Shalem
[time=2494] and it means unhewn untouched unscattered stones in the Old Testament Shalem often referred to rocks that were uncut this is really interesting notice notice this about the temple of God where God commanded Solomon in first king seven listen to this
[time=2517] king six seven it says in building the temple only rocks dressed at the quarry were used and no hammer no chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built
[time=2537] you see the significance no stone to be used in the temple of God that housed the people of God who were to be devoted to their God no stone used at the temple could be cut chiseled
[time=2558] in any way shape or form the uncut stones represent the kind of devotion God was demanding from his nation Shalem whole hearted devotion uncut hearts
[time=2573] David said it himself in Psalm 86 11 teach me your way oh Lord and I will walk in your truth give me an undivided heart that I may fear your name
[time=2586] how's your heart this morning as it relates to him being your authority as it relates to him being your leader the one who is in charge and lovingly giving your life guidance and direction through his spirit and through his word is your heart
[time=2602] this morning is it divided are your affections scattered someone else some of you in the room may honestly assess that today and say you know what it does feel a bit cut it does feel a bit divided
[time=2624] God definitely has competition when it comes to the affection and the desire of my heart
[time=2633] others of you if you've given your heart holy to God Bethmore goes on and says perhaps you remember a time when your heart was divided divided heart places our entire lives in jeopardy
[time=2647] because only God can be totally trusted with our hearts he doesn't demand our complete devotion to feed his ego but to provide for our safety
[time=2663] God uses an undivided heart to keep us out of trouble David learned all about this my friends David learned what happened when your heart gets given away to different things and different people at different times instead of being completely
[time=2684] and totally given to him had a great time really good time trying to illustrate this just this past week I was so honored happy waltz who's been the principal of our elementary school for years and a part of our school forever
[time=2703] happy ask me if I would kind of give the the charge the little speech that every year gets given to the sixth graders cross the street as they make their way over to seventh grade it's kind of a tradition where a dad of a sixth grader gets asked to give a little talk
[time=2720] and my little Maddie who's not little anymore she's sixth grade and heading over across the street and so I got to give the charge and so I was just all two three weeks trying to figure out what I was going to say and I won't give you the whole spiel but the bottom line was I kind of landed on this idea
[time=2737] of how important it would be for them as sixth graders to come across the street to the big seventh grade side and eighth grade in the high school in the whole nine yards and resist the temptation that's always there to just fit in to just be as I said
[time=2753] the other day I said to resist the disease known as commonitis and I begged him to be uncommon I begged him to be different and to not be complacent and to not compromise the unique strengths and abilities that God had given them and I said be uncommon in four ways
[time=2772] I talked about academics how they're going to get over here and kids are going to say well it's not really a big deal and it is a big deal it's a huge deal and what you learn when you give yourself to an uncommon devotion to academics is really good stuff
[time=2787] we talked about academics we talked about parents I told them you're going to get across the street and all of a sudden parents are going to be lame I said it's not true your parents aren't lame your parents are cool trust me
[time=2801] and we talked about the Lord and their commitment to him but here is where I had fun with them I said here's the fourth thing you're going to have to be uncommon with and that is your approach to the opposite sex
[time=2815] and they giggled you know because they're sixth graders and all the fifth graders and fourth graders and third they're all listening and the parents are all in the stands and all the parents are going oh praise God yes talk about this
[time=2827] so I said here's the deal on the opposite sex and I'm just I'm begging you guys to be uncommon about this because the common approach is you get across the street and all of a sudden you want to start hanging out and you want to have a girlfriend
[time=2839] or a boyfriend and and I've seen it for years they want to start texting together they want to start emailing they want to start talking on the phone they want to start having lunch together they want to go to them all together they want to eat together I said hey gang that's called marriage
[time=2857] that's marriage and you're not ready for marriage because what happens is when you start texting and you start emailing and you start talking and you start spinning an ordinate amounts of time together and you start telling secrets and you start telling really personal things
[time=2875] that's sharing with that person your heart you start giving your heart away and I said you start giving your heart away I said girls think about it you're giving your heart away to 13 year old boys
[time=2892] I said six great boys stand up and they're all like oh cool he said stand up they had no idea what was coming they all stood up and I looked every one of those six great boys in the face and I said I love you guys I know all you guys you're good kids you're good boys I love you
[time=2909] I wouldn't trust my daughter's heart with one of you sit down and I said and in case you're wondering when you're 17 I won't either because you're a boy
[time=2928] no but it's really true you start giving your heart when you give your heart wow you give you give everything God says give me your heart all of it undivided allow me to be your authority he says to solemn and acknowledge God
[time=2952] and serve him with all your heart go ahead give him your heart and give it to him freely and give it to him holy huge life lesson with the giving of your heart comes affection devotion commitment give all of that to God and to God alone
[time=2974] and girls you don't give your heart this is pure commentary here this is not the Bible this is Pastor Bird's opinion girls don't give your heart to a boy give your heart to a man someday
[time=2990] who's proven proven with character and integrity and a season of life lived above reproach give your heart to a guy like that someday in the meantime paint your nails have fun go to the mall spend your dad's money
[time=3012] acknowledge acknowledge God David said serve God with a whole heart and look at this lastly serve God serve God with a willing spirit the Hebrew right that down with a willing spirit
[time=3028] the Hebrew word here in the Old Testament text when you study this you see that the word used there for willing you see that in your text with a willing spirit with a willing mind
[time=3041] David says to Solomon as he prepares to say goodbye to him oh son serve your God with a willing spirit kafets C A P H E T S kafets which means you don't want to miss this
[time=3058] which means to find pleasure in to take delight in to be pleased with to have an affection for to desire to choose to bend to bow the main meaning is to feel a strong positive attraction for something to like someone or something very very much
[time=3083] you see what God is saying you see what he's communicating here he wants us and David's begging Solomon to do this to serve God and honor God because we want to
[time=3098] how profound yet simple is that because we want to because he pleases us more than the mall because he pleases us more than the paycheck because he pleases us more than the vacation destination because he pleases us more than 20 seconds on the Internet
[time=3124] because he pleases us more than that last purchase because we choose to you see the Lord searches every heart and understands every motive behind our thoughts and service here the beat of his tender heart as he says choose me because you delight in me
[time=3149] many motives exist for serving God other than pleasure and delight sometimes we end up serving God because we feel guilty sometimes you end up serving God because you feel like you're supposed to sometimes I end up serving God because I feel pressured to because you pay me to
[time=3168] it's not how it's supposed to work no David says to Solomon young man serve him because he's so desirable he's so much better than any other feudal option serve him because he fills you up serve him because you love him serve him because he's more than anything you could ever imagine
[time=3190] serve him with a willing spirit now I love how she says this right now you may be frustrated because serving and knowing God is not your not your greatest pleasure
[time=3203] I know there are people in the room this morning and that is you he is not today your greatest pleasure you may be able to instantly acknowledge a divided heart and your question may be how can I change the way I feel
[time=3219] you know what you can't God can change how you feel God can change your heart I love the verse I have for years it's been one of my favorite verses of all time Deuteronomy 36 you can write it down you can turn there quickly
[time=3239] if you'd like Deuteronomy 36 God can change your heart give listen give him your heart commit to him even if you don't feel like it today your whole heart give him permission to change it to transform it
[time=3255] and listen to the words of Deuteronomy 36 the Lord your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants there's our kids there's our families
[time=3268] the Lord your God will circumcise your heart it's kind of a graphic term it means what you would think it means it means he cuts away the excess
[time=3281] the excess that can be so damaging the excess that can be so confusing the excess that can divert us the excess that can hold us captive God circumcises our hearts
[time=3297] and the hearts of our descendants so that you may love him with all your heart with all your soul and I love the way the verse ends so that you may love him with all your heart and with all your soul and live
[time=3314] not die but live with a whole heart submitted to his authority wholeheartedly given to him in devotion and only him which leads to a willing spirit that's able to understand what a sweet thing it is to be in relationship with him
[time=3334] so great words great words to those of you in the room who may walk across this stage tonight those of you in the room who may walk across another stage in the days to come you'll be in that dorm room soon

[time=3367] and I would and we would encourage you this morning to acknowledge him as your authority each and every day to allow your heart not to be divided but solely and completely his and to love him to enjoy him to delight deeply in him
[time=3385] and in the process bring great glory and honor to him and have a life that will allow you to live not die amen I'll take a pepperoni with that phone there

[time=3434] his fallible life filled with weaknesses and faults and yet God in the midst of all of that you kept him and you held on to him and you grew him and oh God we would pray this morning that you would do that with us
[time=3451] that you would hang on to us and that you would grow us and that we could be people after your own heart God that our hearts could be circumcised that you would cut away whatever you need to cut away in us that we could be a people wholly devoted to you
