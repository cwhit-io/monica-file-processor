[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Friends sent me a link to ministry downtown, S.O.S. Saints on the Street, which that involves going out every Monday night. We pack a backpack with hygiene items, food, blankets, hats, gloves, watches.
[time=55] Whatever you think someone homeless would need. And we just walk the streets, find people under door stoops, find people in stairwells and parking garages.
[time=71] And then also another big part of it is a tie in with the Salvation Army. And having a great relationship there, helping those guys through that whole rehab process.
[time=82] So it's been very rewarding, humbling. There's a lot of words to explain it.
[time=89] (upbeat music)
[time=97] I work in a place that doesn't always foster a Christian attitude or discussions about Christ. And the adoption has really done a blessing in a way that people are curious about it.
[time=113] And so when they start asking me questions, it gives me an opportunity to talk about my faith. And it was a leap of faith to do this adoption.
[time=122] And how I've been rewarded for that leap of faith. I've received so many blessings in return for it. And it's just nice to, it's a nice conversation starter to talk about Christianity and my faith.
[time=138] And it's been really nice that way.
[time=140] And really trusting God and prayerfully, listening and obeying to God. You know, you may feel if God's giving you a nudge, but you might not.
[time=150] You know, "Oh, I don't know." Or you finally do listen. You think, "This is God. It's telling me to do this, but then to obey."
[time=157] And actually do it, you know, and to take that leap of faith and say, "Okay, God, we trust you and we're going to do this thing."
[time=164] [MUSIC]
[time=174] This is the last guy, right?
[time=180] Yeah, well, I usually save him for last because he's always the hardest to find.
[time=184] Good thing, because I'm starting to get a bit creeped out.
[time=187] Oh, what's wrong? Is this your first time in the hood, honey?
[time=190] No, I just don't like making it a habit of hanging out in the bad parts of town.
[time=194] Oh, come on. This isn't that bad. I mean, we haven't even gotten shot at yet.
[time=198] Oh, come on. I'm just kidding.
[time=201] We've been looking for almost 20 minutes and those ladies of the evening said he was staying under the railroad bridge tonight.
[time=208] Yeah, those weren't ladies.
[time=211] Oh, come on. I told you it was going to be a little bit of a culture shock.
[time=216] Now, come on. Pull yourself together. Let's you draw up. Come on. Help me look over here.
[time=220] Yep, here he is.
[time=224] Hey, Ben. What are you doing? I thought we were just going to drop off some food and stuff.
[time=228] Yeah, that's the plan. Just let me check his feet first.
[time=232] Why are they? Oh, oh.
[time=235] Oh, he smells like booze and vomit mixed with me. Oh, is he dead?
[time=243] No, he's just passed out.
[time=247] Oh, is he sure it's safe to touch him?
[time=251] Seriously, he's just a guy. He's a guy who lives under a railroad bridge.
[time=256] A guy who has no socks and whose boots are two sizes too small.
[time=261] A guy who gets scabs and blisters and a guy who could get a serious infection.
[time=268] A guy who's obviously too drunk to care about his feet.
[time=271] Yeah, well, he's too drunk tonight, but it's not like he's always like this.
[time=278] Why doesn't he just go to the Salvation Army or the mission or something?
[time=282] Well, because he got kicked out of the mission for an altercation with another resident last year, and I guess he just doesn't want to get sober right now.
[time=290] Living under here is all he can do right now. I don't call this living.
[time=294] Do you really think he is that much different than you?
[time=297] He is living under a railroad bridge, Jackie.
[time=301] Well, yeah, he is now.
[time=303] What did surprise you if I told you that he graduated from Concordia High School, that he went to Purdue and got a degree in engineering, that he was a contractor for Navistar?
[time=316] So, one day he has it all together and the next he's a bum on the street?
[time=321] No, not exactly.
[time=324] So, what happened to him?
[time=327] Well, a lot of things.
[time=329] I don't really know all the pieces, but his wife and daughter were killed by a drunk driver and he was supposed to be in the car with him.
[time=337] And the accident just really messed him up.
[time=340] He lost his job, then he lost his house, and now, well, he's just lost, period.
[time=348] Wow.
[time=349] Yeah, wow is right.
[time=351] I mean, it's not like all these guys we've seen out here tonight just started off as homeless bums.
[time=356] I mean, they're all people. They're just lost.
[time=359] They're people with needs, but they're needs that we can meet.
[time=363] There.
[time=365] Ben needs new socks and new boots.
[time=369] There we go.
[time=371] There.
[time=372] That is much, much better.
[time=376] Hey, Ben.
[time=378] It's me, Jackie, and my friend, Mark.
[time=381] We brought you some snacks and some water, and I got you some socks and some boots in your size.
[time=388] And we brought some toiletries as well.
[time=391] Put this back here.
[time=392] And I've got a blanket here, too.
[time=394] It's supposed to get back down in the 30s tonight.
[time=396] Oh, that's a good idea.
[time=398] Here we go.
[time=399] Here, Ben.
[time=400] Hey, Ben, I'm going to stop in and see you next week.
[time=403] Is there anything that I can bring you?
[time=406] Ben.
[time=409] He's out.
[time=410] Yeah, I guess.
[time=412] Well, maybe I'll be more coherent next week.
[time=416] Do you think I should stick a 20 in his pocket or something?
[time=419] Oh, probably not. But I'll take it.
[time=422] Hey.
[time=424] Actually, he probably could use a new coat, probably some more shirts.
[time=430] I should bring some socks.
[time=432] I could probably get those next week when I come.
[time=435] You know what?
[time=436] I really am sorry that it took so long to find him, but thanks for coming out with me tonight.
[time=441] No. Thank you.
[time=444] [MUSIC]
[time=458] You're there among the least of these, the weary and the weak.
[time=469] That would be a tragedy for me to turn away.
[time=479] All I need, you have supplied when I was dead.
[time=487] He gave me life, so how could I mind?
[time=493] Give it a rest of me and I'll follow you into the homes of the broken.
[time=507] I'll follow you into the world.
[time=523] Use my hands.
[time=526] Use my feet to make your kingdom apart.
[time=534] To the corners of the earth until your work is done.
[time=543] Yeah.
[time=545] 'Cause faith without works is dead.
[time=550] And on the cross, your blood was shed.
[time=555] So how could you not give it away so freely?
[time=563] Yeah.
[time=565] And I'll follow you into the homes of the broken.
[time=572] I'll follow you into the world.
[time=576] Oh.
[time=578] I'll meet the needs for the part I've been needing.
[time=583] I'll follow you into the world.
[time=586] Yeah.
[time=589] I'll follow you into the homes of the broken.
[time=594] I'll follow you into the world.
[time=598] Oh.
[time=600] I'll meet the needs for the part I've been needing.
[time=604] I'll follow you into the world.
[time=609] I'll hear all my sin.
[time=615] And I'll give all my sin.
[time=626] To you.
[time=630] Oh.
[time=631] And I'll give all my sin.
[time=646] I'll give it all to you.
[time=650] Oh.
[time=651] I'll give all my sin.
[time=655] I'll follow you into the homes of the broken.
[time=661] I'll meet the needs for the part I've been needing.
[time=668] I'll follow you into the world.
[time=674] Oh.
[time=676] I'll follow you into the homes of the broken.
[time=681] I'll follow you into the world.
[time=685] I'll meet the needs for the part I've been needing.
[time=692] Oh.
[time=698] Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=700] It's great to have each of you with us.
[time=702] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=703] I am really thankful today to have my good friend and a face that may be familiar to many of you.
[time=710] For others of you, this may be a first chance for you to meet Pastor Luther Whitfield.
[time=715] Luther, good to have you here, my friend.
[time=717] Well, good to be here with you today.
[time=718] Thank you very much.
[time=719] Luther has been a part of the Fort Wayne, Allen County, this region's past for a long, long time.
[time=727] Has been involved in both youth for Christ and church ministry is here today.
[time=732] You're going to hear Luther's message on Zacchaeus as we continue in our series.
[time=737] Luther, tell the folks that are watching just a little bit about your history here in the Fort Wayne area, how God has used you, how all that began.
[time=746] I grew up here in Fort Wayne with my mom and dad.
[time=750] There was 11 of us in the household.
[time=752] I was the baby of the group.
[time=754] You were the last of 11?
[time=756] I'm the last of 11.
[time=757] I'm a big baby, but it was great.
[time=762] Our parents loved the Lord.
[time=764] We went to a private school all our lives.
[time=767] Went to Concordia High School, graduated from there.
[time=771] From there, went on to River Forest, Illinois, studied, got my degree in teaching, and then later on, the Lord called me into ministry.
[time=780] From there, became the first Black youth pastor in the city with Calvary Chapel.
[time=786] The Lord blessed us there.
[time=787] Our youth group grew to a great number which catapulted the church to build a new building.
[time=793] But from that point, the Lord merely began to speak to my heart and changed the direction because I wanted to help inner cities to develop youth ministry because in a lot of our inner cities, youth ministry didn't exist.
[time=805] And so that's when you for Christ came into the picture, asked me to come on board to develop their urban program, and I've been with them for 20 years.
[time=814] Wow.
[time=815] And out of those 20 years, we started with 45 kids to now well over 500 kids that we're working with, and that is just exciting.
[time=823] In that 500 years-- 500 kids that you're working with in the inner city.
[time=828] In our inner city.
[time=829] Gotcha.
[time=830] And because our inner city is changing, that number has grown because now we got a variety of everything in there from Hispanic to Burmese to Russian.
[time=841] It has really become a true melting pot.
[time=843] And so we have seen God do some incredible things with our center because we built that later on down the road because of the growth of our urban ministry and our desire to continue to reach out and touch kids' lives.
[time=857] It was going on five years ago that the Lord spoke to my heart about starting a work.
[time=865] We were seeing kids come to know Christ in an incredible way.
[time=868] But they wasn't going to a church.
[time=871] They wasn't getting transplanted somewhere.
[time=873] And that just really just broke my heart because we were seeing kids come to know them, but they wasn't being developed the way they should.
[time=882] And so five years ago the Lord spoke to my heart about starting a church.
[time=885] Six families met in the basement of my house.
[time=889] And from there we launched New Covenant Worship Center with help from the chapel and you for Christ.
[time=896] The church was birthed.
[time=898] I remember on Father's Day five years ago, we had some 500-some people show up and it was an exciting time.
[time=907] But I told my wife the next Sunday and said, "Now this is really the first landing." Because now all the guests are gone.
[time=913] But on that official second Sunday, some 190 people showed back up and the church was birthed.
[time=921] And we saw God just add, now with the membership of over 600, we have maxed out our facility.
[time=929] And so we are now currently in the process of looking for another location to grow the ministry.
[time=935] And so we are in meeting with banks, looking at buildings and everything.
[time=939] And so hopefully in the next year God will grant us this opportunity to take the ministry further in some new ways.
[time=948] We're praying with Luther and the New Covenant family.
[time=954] Here at Blackhawk, God will do that.
[time=956] I know specifically that God has led them to a great location over on Colosseum at the old Value City building.
[time=965] And they're hoping that that's what God has in store.
[time=969] There's some details that need to be worked out.
[time=971] I know Luther would covet your prayers.
[time=974] I know we're praying.
[time=975] We would love to have them as neighbors.
[time=978] Right there in the same neighborhood, what God could do, what God we believe will do through a family like the New Covenant family in this neighborhood could be really exciting.
[time=989] So pray with us about that.
[time=992] There's a lot coming down the pipe for these guys in the days to come.
[time=995] Luther's here today.
[time=997] He is becoming more and more, I think, a tool that God is using in my own life.
[time=1002] We sometimes kid, but it's kind of true.
[time=1005] Luther's been used to inner urban ministry.
[time=1008] And we find ourselves at Blackhawk these days in a very growing, outer urban setting.
[time=1014] As you've been hearing me say for a long time, Blackhawk is changing.
[time=1018] It's a diverse community of disciples that God is growing.
[time=1021] And I'm thankful for this brother's help and his encouragement.
[time=1024] Hey, thank you for tuning in today.
[time=1026] I hope your heart will be stirred.
[time=1028] And your relationship with the Lord encouraged as you listen to what Luther has to share from the story of Zacchaeus.
[time=1034] God bless you.
[time=1035] We hope to see you soon.
[time=1051] [MUSIC - 95 seconds]
[time=1153] Father in heaven, we want to be followers of Jesus.
[time=1158] God we pray this morning that you would help us to be courageous and brave in our walk with you.
[time=1167] God that we would sacrifice greatly for your kingdom.
[time=1171] That we would listen hard to your Holy Spirit and that we would seek you with all of our hearts.
[time=1178] As we listen and find where you would have us go and imitate Jesus by meeting the lost and the hurting and the sick
[time=1187] and the broken.
[time=1190] God we pray that you would lead us and empower us to be agents of change in a world that's hurting and desperate for a touch from you.
[time=1202] God may you be pleased in our attempts to follow and would you guide us and would you lead us and would you help us know which way to go.
[time=1211] [AMEN] Just sing one more song together.
[time=1218] It just bakes the Spirit of God to lead us on.
[time=1222] No matter where we go.
[time=1225] [MUSIC]
[time=1239] Lead on a King eternal.
[time=1241] [MUSIC]
[time=1285] Lead on who King eternal.
[time=1290] To sense this voice shall see.
[time=1294] And only the shall we spark the sweet and bell of peace.
[time=1302] For God we sure is love-clashing for all of our angels.
[time=1311] With tears of love and mercy.
[time=1315] For at the King of God.
[time=1324] [MUSIC]
[time=1365] Lead on no King eternal.
[time=1370] We follow not with fears.
[time=1374] For gladness breaks like dawning.
[time=1378] Wherever thy face appears.
[time=1382] Thy cross is lifted.
[time=1385] Lord us, be joined.
[time=1389] Lead us on.
[time=1391] [MUSIC]
[time=1480] Lead us on.
[time=1483] [MUSIC]
[time=1493] Thank you for being here.
[time=1495] Hey, I want to introduce to you this morning a good friend who is going to continue on with us in our series that we just started.
[time=1501] You see it there.
[time=1503] Real life, real stories.
[time=1505] Lessons learned from the life of 14 different characters that we've pulled from the scriptures.
[time=1512] We're going to learn some things about how God worked and what God did and how we can learn and grow from the everyday experiences of everyday people.
[time=1522] And I'm so thankful that Pastor Luther Woodfield is here with us this morning.
[time=1527] Luther has been engaged in ministry in this community for over 20 years.
[time=1533] At the beginning of that stint he was heavily involved and influenced and loved and led thousands, really thousands of students in this region toward Christ and helped grow them in their faith through his involvement with youth for Christ.
[time=1550] Through that involvement in youth for Christ Luther began to have a burden for youth and students and the inner city and God led him and a team of others to start what is now known as the Primetime Center.
[time=1560] What started with I think 40 kids is now over 500 and that ministry has just continued to grow as they reach out to what is now African American, Hispanic, Asian, Russian, Burmese, all kinds of young people who God loves.
[time=1577] And the Primetime Center has become a home for them.
[time=1580] Out of the Primetime Center experience Luther was led to start a church.
[time=1585] They were ministering to so many kids and with kids comes families and in that setting there was just an enormous opportunity.
[time=1593] And so what was birthed was New Covenant Worship Center; Luther is the senior pastor of New Covenant Worship Center.
[time=1601] He is a friend of ours.
[time=1603] He is a growing friend of mine.
[time=1605] I have been blessed by his presence in my life as we continue at Black Hawk to minister to an ever-changing demographic and a new opportunity that God has given us here in Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=1616] He has been a huge encouragement to me.
[time=1620] Contrary to what some people think we are not twins, we were not separated at birth, but nonetheless we are really, really thankful for each other.
[time=1630] Would you please, as he comes to speak to us this morning and encourage us from God's word, would you give a really warm Black Hawk welcome to Luther Woodfield?
[time=1651] I did tell people we were twins. Okay, never mind.
[time=1658] Bless you. What a blessing it is to be with you this morning.
[time=1662] Let's one more time go to the Lord in prayer.
[time=1665] Father in the name of Jesus we glorify you and we thank you for your presence in this place.
[time=1671] I pray today, Father, that my brothers and sisters will see very little Luther, but Father all of you.
[time=1678] Help me to decrease that you might increase.
[time=1681] Hide me behind the foot of your cross.
[time=1684] Annoying our ears that we might hear your voice.
[time=1687] Annoying our hands and our feet that we may not be just hears of this word, but God doers of this word.
[time=1693] And certainly will give you all the praise, the honor and the glory, for it is in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=1702] Luke chapter 19, beginning with verse 1.
[time=1709] Once you find it, you'll find these words written.
[time=1718] And he entered and was passing through Jericho.
[time=1722] And behold, there was a man called by the name of Zacchaeus, and he was achieved tax-gatherer, and he was rich.
[time=1731] And he was trying to see who Jesus was, and he was unable because of the crowd, for he was small in stature.
[time=1740] And ran on ahead and climbed into a sycamore tree in order to see him.
[time=1745] He was about to pass that way.
[time=1747] And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry and come down.
[time=1753] For today I must stay at your house.
[time=1755] And he returned and came down and received him gladly.
[time=1759] And when they saw it, they began to grumble, saying, "He has gone to be the guest of a man who was a sinner."
[time=1767] And Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, half of all my possessions I give to the poor.
[time=1775] And if I have defrauded anyone of anything I will give back four times as much."
[time=1782] And Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is the son of Abraham.
[time=1791] For the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost."
[time=1797] [AMEN] About a month or so ago, Pastor Kelly had asked me to come and to be a guest today.
[time=1807] And I looked forward to it and I remember him so clearly sharing with me the topic of this time together.
[time=1814] They would be finding characters in the Bible and who you could preach about, be opened up.
[time=1821] And right off the bat, I rattled off Zacchaeus and lo and behold, I had no idea why Zacchaeus.
[time=1827] Maybe I had a childhood moment of my Sunday school teacher teaching to me about Zacchaeus.
[time=1833] I mean, honestly, truthfully, my brothers and sisters, there could have been a lot of people I could have talked about.
[time=1840] I mean, my passion for Elijah, my love for Jeremiah, my interest in Bartimaeus.
[time=1846] There were just plenty of folks I could have preached about and yet the Lord led me to Zacchaeus.
[time=1853] And every time I talked about Zacchaeus, I would always recall in my mind, the record in my mind,
[time=1859] would hear the voice of my Sunday school teacher talking about this wee little man who wanted to see Jesus.
[time=1865] And yet the more I started studying Zacchaeus, the more I found his brother to be rather fascinating,
[time=1871] because yet God uses him and comes into his life in a most powerful way.
[time=1878] Is that encounter that transforms Zacchaeus?
[time=1882] Or that single encounter with the same?
[time=1885] I mean, his name alone stands interesting to me.
[time=1889] His name means righteous one.
[time=1893] And when you think about that, I mean, if you were to interview the people of Jericho, if you were to talk to the religious affluent, if you were to talk to some of the Jewish brothers at that time,
[time=1903] they would say you got to be joking.
[time=1906] There's no way you could be talking about Zacchaeus as a righteous one.
[time=1911] Because at that time, the tax collectors were considered renegades to the religious affluent of that at time,
[time=1921] to the Jewish people.
[time=1924] I mean, the idea that these are folks who made their money had acquired their wealth by hustling others.
[time=1932] They would overcharge their clients and pocket the rest for themselves.
[time=1939] He made a living out of manipulating people.
[time=1944] The Jewish nation considered him a renegade for the sub-effect. He was someone who has aligned himself with Gentiles
[time=1952] and was using his position against the people.
[time=1957] Righteous one. Yeah, really.
[time=1960] And yet there was something unique about him because in this time, Zacchaeus has this incredible encounter with Jesus.
[time=1972] And I often wondered what in the world who led him, what perked his curiosity to pursue after Jesus?
[time=1981] I mean, Zacchaeus, really.
[time=1983] Maybe it was Levi.
[time=1985] Levi was a former tax collector.
[time=1990] Luke talks about him in Luke chapter 5, beginning with verse 27.
[time=1994] I mean, Levi was the former tax collector, but you and I probably better know him as Matthew.
[time=2001] Levi was the individual who comes into Zacchaeus' life and maybe, just maybe church, maybe Matthew could identify with Zacchaeus.
[time=2010] Maybe he understood the views of how people looked down him.
[time=2016] Maybe he understood how people were disgusted with him.
[time=2021] Maybe he understood the hustle.
[time=2024] Maybe he understood because he had been there himself before.
[time=2029] And yet somehow God uses Levi as a conduit of grace, a distributive of grace to say, I resonate with you, brother.
[time=2041] I understand.
[time=2043] Because I mean, you know, it was Jesus who comes into my office and speaks to me and I left everything to follow him.
[time=2054] Maybe he simply understood what it's like to be ostracized, what it's like to be looked down upon, what it's like to be called a sinner.
[time=2071] So maybe Levi ministered to him, maybe Levi simply said, you know what you need to go see this Jesus, I'm telling you, you need to go see this Jesus.
[time=2081] You need to be to my promise you he'll change your life.
[time=2085] Maybe that's what he did.
[time=2088] Maybe he simply heard about all the miracles that Jesus had performed.
[time=2093] Maybe he was fascinated of the concept that Jesus had walked on the water.
[time=2099] Maybe he was drawn over the simple fact how someone could take a couple of barley loaves and a couple of pieces of fish and lift him up before the father in a multitude is fed.
[time=2109] Whatever the reason or the rationale, one thing is certain is that Zacchaeus wanted to meet Jesus.
[time=2120] And so he goes where Jesus was, and he pursues him.
[time=2127] And lo and behold, in his pursuit of going to see Jesus, he runs into a crowd and Luke, Dr. Luke, is so fascinated with this story that he is captured by everything.
[time=2139] He looks and he says, wait a minute, he can't seize him.
[time=2142] He says that the obstacles are preventing him from seeing Jesus and the number one reason is because he is short in stature.
[time=2151] He's a small man, he doesn't have the height to see Jesus, he's short.
[time=2157] And you know the moment I started looking at that, right away I started thinking about myself because I mean truth be told, probably if we were to be honest this morning, some of us are spiritually short.
[time=2168] Scripture says in Romans 3, 23, all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[time=2177] I mean when I started looking at my life, there's been plenty of times, brothers and sisters.
[time=2181] I gotta be honest with you, there have been plenty of times I have come short of seeing the Savior.
[time=2189] There have been plenty of obstacles, plenty of struggles, plenty of challenges in life.
[time=2195] And when the Savior was right there and I fell short of seeing him, regretted, but I want to be real with you.
[time=2210] Prior times I fallen short and truth be told, I'm not the only one in here.
[time=2217] Some of us in here have fallen short of seeing the Savior.
[time=2224] He fell short.
[time=2227] Well I like him.
[time=2229] I like him because he is determined to see Jesus.
[time=2235] He is determined to get a look at the Savior.
[time=2238] He is determined to meet this guy, he is determined.
[time=2242] If I could only get a glimpse of him, he is determined to do that.
[time=2245] So what takes his transpires next blows me away.
[time=2249] What he does is he is trying to look over the crowd he can't seize and what he does is he starts running back into the city.
[time=2258] And that's unusual.
[time=2260] That's unorthodox because Eastern Customs simply says this, is that if you were wealthy, if you were a government official, it was beneath you to run.
[time=2272] And yet here is this wealthy, this affluent brother, this government official, is running.
[time=2279] He is almost like childlike in behavior.
[time=2283] He is running.
[time=2284] He is anxious to see Jesus.
[time=2287] No wonder, I mean there is no wonder that Luke tells us unless we come like a child, we should not enter to the kingdom of God.
[time=2296] There is something about being childlike.
[time=2298] I will tell you for a moment, I thought I was set up for a moment when this little precious girl come walking up the steps and drops her net down.
[time=2314] The innocence of that, you know, the last minute, but yet I got to do this.
[time=2321] And so she kind of interrupts everything that goes on because she just got to get to.
[time=2328] When I see back at home that shouting territory, that's incredible.
[time=2338] He becomes childlike.
[time=2344] I mean, John Calvin says that curiosity and simplicity are the sort of preparation in faith.
[time=2353] I mean, his curiosity overwhelms him that he is willing to disregard his dignity to get a view of Jesus.
[time=2364] And so he comes running and he runs to a sycamore tree.
[time=2371] He doesn't run to a building, he doesn't run to where he look out the window.
[time=2376] He does nothing.
[time=2377] I mean, it's the first thing that he encounters.
[time=2380] It's a sycamore tree and he runs, he climbs into a sycamore tree.
[time=2385] He sets aside all the dignity and all the affluency.
[time=2390] He sets aside all the cares of the people, the viewpoints of the people, the looks of the people.
[time=2397] He says that all aside, can you imagine for a moment this businessman, this government official,
[time=2406] and his sharpest Amani suit, cell phone to the side, expensive tie.
[time=2417] I mean, if I was back at home, I would say this boy is jeed up.
[time=2422] This boy's GQ down, he's looking good.
[time=2426] And yet he is so captivated by wanting to get a glimpse of Jesus that he looks and he says I'm climbing up that tree.
[time=2434] I mean, he just becomes so child-like in nature that he says I'm getting a view of Jesus.
[time=2440] I often wondered as I had started studying this thing is what keeps us from putting ourselves out on a limb for Jesus.
[time=2451] I mean, really, what's hindering you today from putting yourself out on a limb to see Jesus?
[time=2462] I tell you, you know what, they brought me this land and I started thinking, you know what, I believe some reasons why some people don't climb to get a better view of Jesus
[time=2471] is because number one, they're concerned about what people think.
[time=2475] What are people going to say?
[time=2478] If I put myself out there.
[time=2481] I mean, what would people say if I really just become transparent in nature?
[time=2485] And I really take off the mask and show myself, you know.
[time=2490] Some people don't climb because they're more concerned about what people think versus what Jesus thinks about them.
[time=2498] Some people don't climb because you know what, they are afraid.
[time=2504] They're afraid of being neglected or rejected.
[time=2510] They're afraid that someone may not receive them.
[time=2514] They're afraid.
[time=2516] Some people don't climb because they're afraid of additional responsibility.
[time=2522] They're afraid because they know that the higher you go, the more your butt is exposed.
[time=2529] And for that very reason, I may need to come down here.
[time=2539] They're afraid of the responsibility that's attached to it.
[time=2544] Because it's safe to stay in our own little corner.
[time=2548] Because if I go higher, I'll see the herd of people outside these walls.
[time=2557] I'll see the plight of people outside of these walls.
[time=2562] See neighborhoods in devastation.
[time=2567] I'll see kids without fathers.
[time=2572] Mothers without husbands.
[time=2575] Daughters on the street.
[time=2578] Sons in jail.
[time=2580] And yet it's easy to stay here and to get a glimpse of him here.
[time=2585] And yet he calls us out there.
[time=2587] And so I don't want to climb because I don't want to be responsible.
[time=2592] Another reason why some people don't climb is because they know that the higher you, new levels brings new devils.
[time=2601] The higher I go, there's more, more attacks from the enemy.
[time=2606] The higher I go, in my view of Jesus, it doesn't please the enemy.
[time=2611] He comes after me and so it's easier for me to stay on a lower level to stay low key.
[time=2617] But I like this brother.
[time=2618] It's because he's willing to put himself on a limb to see him.
[time=2625] Jesus comes and it cracks me up.
[time=2627] Jesus comes and the crowd is following him and Jesus comes and he looks up in that tree.
[time=2633] And here is hanging this, this affluent guy, this business guy.
[time=2638] I mean, he's kind of like, you know, when I think of that kid, I kind of, in that second more tree, I go back to my mind as a grandparent thinking about playing with my daughter.
[time=2647] We would watch Sesame Street and I could hear the song.
[time=2650] One of these things doesn't belong here.
[time=2655] He's in this tree.
[time=2657] And Jesus looks at him and he says that he is.
[time=2665] Come down.
[time=2668] Salvation has come to your house.
[time=2671] I must abide there.
[time=2675] That word abide is the same word that Paul uses in Ephesians.
[time=2681] Three, seven, three, seventeen.
[time=2685] That word abide means to be comfortable.
[time=2688] He says to him, he says, listen, Zacchaeus, come down.
[time=2692] You know the first thing that blows me away is the fact that Jesus notices him in the
[time=2699] tree.
[time=2700] I mean, come on, y'all.
[time=2701] There were other people all around Jesus.
[time=2703] There were other people who had issues, who were struggling, who was hurting, who was wounded.
[time=2709] And yet out of all the people that's there, Luke tells us, Luke says, wait a minute.
[time=2713] I know there were a lot of people there.
[time=2714] Dr. Luke says, listen, the only person he noticed was the one that was in the tree, which gives
[time=2720] me the tendency to believe that Jesus noticed those who are willing to rise above their
[time=2727] handicap.
[time=2731] He noticed those who are willing to stretch themselves for his purpose and for his glory.
[time=2739] I mean, come on.
[time=2742] Bartimaeus was one who did that.
[time=2745] I was so intrigued with Bartimaeus because when Bartimaeus, this poor beggar sitting on the side of the road, he's hearing the crowd.
[time=2753] He's hearing the ushering of the people.
[time=2755] He's probably sitting there and hearing Jesus speak.
[time=2758] And then all of a sudden with the masses that's there, Jesus calls for Bartimaeus.
[time=2764] He knows him by name.
[time=2765] Why?
[time=2766] Because Bartimaeus cries out to him.
[time=2769] Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.
[time=2774] You would think that some of the precious brothers and sisters in the crowd would say, listen, man, I know you want to see him.
[time=2781] Let me help maneuver you closer so you can get a good look at him.
[time=2786] But what does the crowd say?
[time=2789] The same thing that the enemy is saying to you today to shut up and be quiet.
[time=2800] He cries out more, Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me now.
[time=2804] And the Bible says, the Bible says that Jesus says, hey, tell him to take courage.
[time=2809] I'm calling for him.
[time=2811] And what does he do?
[time=2812] What is the thing that rivets me the most?
[time=2814] He drops his cloak.
[time=2816] His cloak was his crutch.
[time=2820] He would use the cloak and tie it around his waist and some kid would lead him through the city.
[time=2825] Because they didn't have seeing eye dogs or sensitivity sticks.
[time=2830] Sometimes he would wrap it in his hand and a kid would guide him.
[time=2833] And with the other hand, he would lead.
[time=2835] But the moment he heard Jesus was calling for him, he dropped his cloak.
[time=2841] He dropped his crutch and navigated himself through thousands of people to stand before Jesus.
[time=2851] He notices those who are willing to stretch themselves to get a glimpse of him.
[time=2860] So he tells that kids, he says, I need you to come down.
[time=2865] Come down.
[time=2866] Because I must abide at your house.
[time=2868] In other words, he says that kids, I want you to be comfortable.
[time=2874] You talk about being blessed when I start looking at that, blessed.
[time=2879] Because what the Savior does is he says, listen, you thought you were looking for me.
[time=2887] I came looking for you.
[time=2891] I came looking for you this morning.
[time=2894] I came looking for you.
[time=2896] You thought you were looking for me.
[time=2897] I came looking for you and I knew you would be here.
[time=2903] I want you to know you can come down this morning and be comfortable.
[time=2908] You don't have to put on no pretense.
[time=2916] You can come just the way you are.
[time=2921] Hurting, wounded, afflicted, disappointment, disillusionment, whatever you're dealing with,
[time=2929] you can be comfortable today because I came looking for you.
[time=2936] And I want to abide with you.
[time=2942] I know you've been hurt.
[time=2943] I know you've been trouble.
[time=2946] You might even have been ostracized.
[time=2949] But I came looking for you today.
[time=2953] You come down and allow me to abide with you.
[time=2959] See, that blows me away because the Scripture says he comes and he knocks on the door.
[time=2966] But in this particular text, Jesus says, I'm coming.
[time=2971] I'm coming to stay with you.
[time=2974] I mean, Scripture says he's a gentleman.
[time=2976] He knocks on the door and whoever opens up, he'll come in and suffer with you.
[time=2980] And this text, Jesus is saying, I'm coming.
[time=2983] I'm coming.
[time=2984] You are just too important to overlook.
[time=2988] You are just too important for me to pass by.
[time=2991] I am coming for you.
[time=2993] I am so glad.
[time=2994] I don't know about y'all today.
[time=2995] But I'm so glad when I look back over the benchmarks of my life.
[time=2999] I'm so glad that Jesus didn't pass me by.
[time=3002] I'm so glad that he found me in my mess.
[time=3008] I'm so glad he found me in my failures.
[time=3010] I'm so glad this morning that the sovereign Savior did not pass me by.
[time=3016] It makes sense to me when I hear the songwriter says, pass me not, oh, gentle Savior.
[time=3025] Hear my humble cry.
[time=3028] While on others, thou are calling.
[time=3033] Do not, hallelujah, do not pass me by.
[time=3042] And he stops.
[time=3045] And he says, does that key just come down?
[time=3048] You know what I found down is that whenever you pursue after Jesus, whenever you're willing
[time=3056] to take the gamble and the risk to go to another level to see him, whenever you're willing
[time=3062] to come out of your comfort zone and leave the comforts of a plush building and go out
[time=3069] there to find and to seek Jesus, everybody's not going to be happy.
[time=3079] Everybody's not going to be thrilled that you are willing to stretch yourself out on
[time=3085] the limb.
[time=3086] Everybody's not going to be excited that you are willing to rise above your circumstances to pursue him.
[time=3092] I mean, you know, the sad tragedy is, is the people who you think should understand or usually the people who don't understand.
[time=3103] The Jewish leaders looked at him and said, oh, are you kidding me?
[time=3106] He's dining with sinners.
[time=3107] They grumbled in their complaining.
[time=3111] Everybody's not going to be happy.
[time=3114] What I like this is because there has been this genuine encounter with Jesus and what
[time=3122] I love about Jesus is that he changes us from the inside out and look what Zacchaeus says.
[time=3129] Zacchaeus looks up at Jesus and he is a student of the Mosaic law.
[time=3135] He says, listen, he says, if I have stolen anything, Lord, I'll give it back.
[time=3147] Anything, Mosaic law says that if a thief has confessed in taking some goods, he has
[time=3155] to pay back restitution, not only what he'd taken, but one fifth more.
[time=3162] If he's caught with it, he has to give double.
[time=3168] Zacchaeus is not grumbling over law.
[time=3172] He's not grumbling over principle.
[time=3176] He says, if I've taken anything, if I've yet fallen anybody, if I've hurt anybody, take it all because what I thought was the most important thing.
[time=3191] I thought what made me a big man, my wealth, my image, my prestige, today, none of that
[time=3200] matters than having that relationship with you.
[time=3207] I'm willing to give it all.
[time=3208] What about you today?
[time=3209] Are you really willing to give it all?
[time=3212] He said, I'll give it all.
[time=3214] There's been a change in this brother's heart.
[time=3219] And then Jesus, in the crowd, looks at him, and I love what Jesus says because when Jesus
[time=3225] looks at him, Jesus says salvation.
[time=3230] Salvation has come to your house.
[time=3232] You are the son of Abraham.
[time=3234] Wait a minute.
[time=3235] Hold up.
[time=3236] Zacchaeus, the son of Abraham, Zacchaeus, Zacchaeus, the renegade.
[time=3246] Zacchaeus, the manipulator, the Zacchaeus, the thief, is the son of Abraham.
[time=3255] How can that be?
[time=3258] Because he has this encounter with Jesus.
[time=3261] He believes in Jesus.
[time=3263] He has faith.
[time=3265] Now faith without works is dead.
[time=3269] And so he exemplifies Abraham more than anything because he says, not only do I believe in you Jesus, but I'm willing to lay down everything for you.
[time=3282] Like Abraham who laid down Isaac, his only son, Zacchaeus says, I'm willing to lay it
[time=3288] all down for you.
[time=3294] In the Father, Jesus looks at him and says, ah, you are the son of Abraham.
[time=3304] What about you today?
[time=3307] Does he say that about you and I today?
[time=3313] Are you really?
[time=3314] I mean, come on, really seriously.
[time=3316] Are you really willing to go out on a limb for him?
[time=3321] Are you really willing to lay it all on the line for him?
[time=3330] How bad?
[time=3334] Black Hulk, how bad do you really want to see him?
[time=3342] Are we really willing to be like the little girl who disrupts the service in her little
[time=3352] sweet, tender way to drop her net to see Jesus?
[time=3361] I pray that all of us who like her today, that we're willing to go out on a limb just
[time=3370] to get a glimpse of the Savior.
[time=3374] Pass me not, O gentle Savior, hear my humble cry while another's thou art calling.
[time=3387] Thank you for not passing me by.
[time=3392] [AMEN] Let's pray, Father, thank you today that you don't pass us by.
[time=3404] But even right now in this place, Father, you are indeed looking for us.
[time=3413] You knew we would be here.
[time=3415] You knew our shortcomings, our failures, our disappointments.
[time=3419] You knew we would be here, and you pursued us, and you look for us.
[time=3427] Help us, Father, to have that tenacity, to pursue you, to stretch ourselves out on a
[time=3434] limb, to rise above our circumstances and our handicaps, knowing, Father, that all things
[time=3442] work together for our good.
[time=3445] We love you today.
[time=3448] Thank you for loving me and meeting me just where I am.
[time=3453] [AMEN - 85 seconds]
