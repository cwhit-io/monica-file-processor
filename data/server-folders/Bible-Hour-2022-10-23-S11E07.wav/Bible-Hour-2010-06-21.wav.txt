[time=446] [APPLAUSE]
[time=449] >> Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast, it is as always good to have you with us, on a Sunday morning here at Black Hawk, or even out in the public at the grocery store at the gas station.
[time=461] I have the privilege and it really is that a privilege to hear from people inside and outside the walls of Black Hawk Ministries, people who really appreciate and enjoy the broadcast message that we're able to bring week after week.
[time=476] You know, teaching and explaining God's word is one of my greatest passions and something that I couldn't be more thankful for. I can't believe God allows me to do this with my life and we do it week after week and to know that it touches people's lives and to know that they appreciate the message is really encouraging.
[time=496] I want to challenge you though, I want to encourage you with the notion that there's a way you can enjoy our teaching, there's a way you can take in this message beyond just watching the broadcast or being here on a Sunday morning.
[time=511] That's right, about Wednesday each week there's a resource that shows up on our website and you can see our website address here at the bottom of the screen. And if you go to our website and you scroll down on the home page to this icon that says digging deeper.
[time=526] By about Wednesday afternoon, every week, the message that you heard the previous Sunday has been kind of dissected and furthered if you will. It is a study opportunity.
[time=538] It is an interaction opportunity for you to take the message and go even further into the scriptures and even further into your own life.
[time=547] We think it's very important here at Blackhawk that we be not only hearers of the word but doers of the word and the digging deeper resource is something that allows you to further study, further reflect, and most importantly further apply God's word.
[time=565] I want to encourage you to use it personally in your daily devotions. I want to encourage you to use it in your small group or with your family at your nightly Bible time.
[time=576] It is a resource that will encourage and challenge and stretch you and the great thing about it is it builds upon the message from Sunday.
[time=585] So many times I think we in the church hear so many messages. We hear them on Sundays. We hear them on the Internet on Tuesday. We hear them on TV on Wednesday.
[time=596] We hear message after message after message. This is a way for you to hear a message on Sunday and then continue to hear that same message only further explained, further studied, further applied.
[time=610] I can't wait for you. Those of you who haven't seen it, there are hundreds of folks who access the digging deeper every week and we're thankful for that but I want to make it available to even more of you.
[time=621] God's word is life-changing and when we give ourselves to it day after day after day, it does miraculous things in our lives.
[time=629] I hope you'll check it out, digging deeper on our BlackhawkMinistries.org homepage.
[time=634] Hey, thanks for tuning in. God bless you. I hope you have a great week and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=640] [MUSIC]
[time=652] You could hold the wealth of God such treasure found in him.
[time=662] You could comprehend his heart and mind. His wisdom has no end.
[time=672] For from him, through him, to him are all things.
[time=692] to be the glory forever, to be the glory, Lord amen, to be the glory, forever, to be the glory, Lord amen.
[time=718] Who has known the mind of God, who has counseled him, who has given gifts to my God, that he might be repaired.
[time=739] From him, through him, to him are all fields.
[time=749] From him, through him, to him are all things, to be the glory forever, to be the glory, Lord amen.
[time=769] To be the glory forever, to be the glory, Lord amen.
[time=781] In dark and light, in death and life, with hard times entering.
[time=792] In all things we will worship you, when you there is no end, there is no end.
[time=807] To be the glory forever, to be the glory, Lord amen.
[time=853] From him, through him, to him are all fields.
[time=872] Stand as we sing this next song.
[time=902] To be the glory forever, to be the glory forever, to be the glory forever, to be the glory forever.
[time=1037] Filled with wonder, all struck wonder at the mention of your name.
[time=1053] She's just your name is power, running living water, such a marvelous mystery.
[time=1069] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and isn't this a God.
[time=1114] To be the glory forever, to be the glory forever, to be the glory forever, to be the glory forever.
[time=1185] You are Lord of Lords, you are King of Kings, you are Mighty God, Lord of everything.
[time=1196] Lord, remember you, well, you're the great I am, you're the Prince of Peace, who is the Lamb, you're the living God.
[time=1210] You are my saving grace, you will reign forever.
[time=1216] You are ancient of days, you are Alpha Omega, the beginning and end.
[time=1225] You are my sweet, your desire, the king, the urban friend, for my Prince of Peace, and I will live my life for you.
[time=1239] You are Lord of Lords, you are King of Kings, you are Mighty God, Lord of everything.
[time=1253] To be the glory forever, to be the glory forever, to be the glory forever, to be the glory forever.
[time=1289] You are my Prince of Peace, and I will live my life for you.
[time=1340] I want to do my best to encourage fathers this morning as we come to a character in our ongoing study, real life, real stories, lessons learned from the life of this morning we come to an individual named Eli.
[time=1357] Would you open your Bibles to 1 Samuel?
[time=1380] We are also looking at the same time, really, at the story of a man named Alkana.
[time=1390] Alkana was a man, a Jewish man with two wives, one whose name was Paniah, and one whose name was Hannah.
[time=1399] And the story of Hannah is a very well-known story to many of us.
[time=1404] When we look to the story of Eli and his two sons, we see kind of corresponding with that the story of Hannah, whose husband was Alkana and Hannah's womb, as many of you know, was her womb was closed.
[time=1417] There were no children between Alkana and Hannah.
[time=1420] There were a number of children with Paniah, and Paniah kind of let Hannah have it as the days and the years went by, but Hannah stayed humble, Hannah stayed gracious, and as most of you know, as you read through this account,
[time=1433] she prayed and asked God if it would be his will to open her womb so she could have a child.
[time=1441] If it was a boy, she would dedicate that young man, she would give that boy to the service of the Lord.
[time=1448] And that little boy was born, God did open her womb, and that little boy's name was Samuel.
[time=1456] And Samuel was given to the service of the Lord. He was given to the service of the Lord at a temple at a place called Shiloh to a priest named Eli who had two sons that were helping him in the ministry, if you will.
[time=1472] And so we see the story of Samuel developing, and we see the story of Eli, Hophne, and Phineas developing along the way. And as we go through this, I want to just take some time to point out what I think are some very applicable principles.
[time=1488] For any of you in the room who are fathers, I think there's plenty for you mothers to hear as well.
[time=1494] I think there's plenty for you kids to grasp. I think this is a message for all of us, but this morning I hope it can be an encouragement to you dads in the room, Eli.
[time=1504] And we begin. Let me just jump in. Chapter 2, verses 11 and 12. Samuel has been born. The prayer had been made. Hannah's prayer is answered.
[time=1515] She dedicates her son. She thanks God in this tremendous song of Thanksgiving in chapter 2, verses 1 through 10. And then as you come to the conclusion of Hannah's song of Thanksgiving in chapter 10, it says there in 11.
[time=1532] It says, "Then Elkana went to his home, left Shiloh, the temple where they had worshipped, and where they had brought Samuel. Then Elkana went to his home at Ramah, but the boy ministered to the Lord before Eli, the what? Say it.
[time=1551] The priest. Eli is a priest. Now the sons, here you go, verse 12, things you just don't want to read as a dad. Now the sons of Eli were worthless men.
[time=1568] Now the sons of Eli, Hothney and Phineas were worthless men. They did not know who, the Lord.
[time=1583] First thing I want you guys to take note of this morning is God's call to father. God's calling on your life to father ultimately trumps all other callings, and it certainly trumps your career and the obsession that you and I can have at times with our careers.
[time=1601] God's call to father ultimately trumps career obsession. Now as I read 11 and 12, again I want you to know the key phrase here isn't priest. I'm not going to necessarily pick on Eli because he was a priest.
[time=1614] There are some things that we want to say about that, and we'll get to that in a moment. But the key phrase isn't priest. This guy, this dad could have been a mechanic.
[time=1625] This dad could have been a teacher. This dad could have been a doctor. This dad could have been a surgeon. This dad could have been a banker, a business owner, a factory worker.
[time=1635] The key phrase isn't that he was a priest. The key thought really in this passage is that his sons were worthless men. His sons that says were worthless men.
[time=1649] Eli, listen and don't misunderstand this. Eli had fathered from birth now and had as a result two grown men who didn't know the Lord and were in character worthless.
[time=1666] They didn't know God. As a priest, now we'll come back to that just for a moment because we need to. As a priest, Eli's sole priority and responsibility was to represent God to the people.
[time=1681] I've been telling you for three years now that the sole priority of a priest was to pass along God to others. The sole purpose and responsibility of his calling was to represent God to the people that he was ministering to to pass along God to others to teach the people about God.
[time=1701] But to the two people that meant the most to the two most important individuals in Eli's life, his own boy, something had gone terribly wrong.
[time=1713] It doesn't tell us the specifics of this, my friends. But there's enough room left for us to at least wonder if what has transpired here is what has transpired in many, many situations over the years.
[time=1728] And that is a guy in this case who was involved in ministry, more involved maybe in ministry than ministering to his own family.
[time=1741] Some of you work for clients, debt, some of you in the room work for clients, some of you work for customers, some of you work for and with patients.
[time=1754] I have, some would say, I have a congregation.
[time=1759] And I want you to know how easy it is. I with you know how at times it is easy to become so utterly fixated on, so deeply devoted to, so devoted in our hearts and minds to keep customers and to keep patients and to keep clients and to keep congregations happy.
[time=1781] We sometimes get it skewed and think that the happy congregation or the happy customer or the happy client is what we're after.
[time=1792] I understand that.
[time=1795] I've lived in that skewed world before.
[time=1800] So thankful for an old senior adult, 60 year old guy who just were fun, decided to enroll in seminary, my very first year of seminary at the age of 21.
[time=1814] And before we had any kids and before I had any congregation, that old guy pulled me aside one day at lunch and said, don't ever forget, don't ever forget the most important congregation you'll ever have.
[time=1829] Is your wife and kids.
[time=1833] And I want to just be clear with all of you guys in this room this morning, I believe God has called you to do a great job at whatever it is you do for a living.
[time=1844] However, it is you support that family. God wants you to do all that you do as unto him. And so you should be faithful and you should be diligent and you should be excellent at what you do.
[time=1857] But the excellence at which you do your job and the devotion with which you give yourself to it should not exceed the devotion and the love and the investment and the proximity and the relationship.
[time=1873] But God allows you to give to your family.
[time=1878] Don't be fooled.
[time=1881] Don't be deceived.
[time=1883] Real success for you as a believer, as a father, as a follower of Jesus Christ who has been given the opportunity to invest in a family, do not be deceived.
[time=1897] Real success is not tied to your net worth or vocational reputation.
[time=1902] It is tied to your faithful effort to invest a love for God into your family.
[time=1910] Did you hear that?
[time=1912] That is what determines how successful you are.
[time=1916] That is what should determine how high a reputation you carry the degree to which you invest through time and energy and sacrifice and effort into your family, a genuine, growing love for God.
[time=1934] I stand in front of you this morning as someone who has failed and succeeded on that front and I just want to do my very best to continue to succeed.
[time=1945] There have been times, I promise you there have been times especially early in my time even here at Blackhawk where I sacrificed my family because of my desire to do well here further this effort and keep you happy.
[time=1966] That wasn't something you put on me.
[time=1968] That was something I put on myself and it was wrong.
[time=1973] I promise you this in recent years and maybe you've seen it, maybe you haven't.
[time=1978] It's just the truth though.
[time=1979] There are times in recent years, thank God, where I have said no to things here that watch, that would have very likely furthered us.
[time=1991] There are times I've said no to that because of the lessons learned and the commitment God has given me to try and be a pastor and a leader and a guide to the one congregation.
[time=2002] That means the most to me which is my family.
[time=2006] Dad's, there is no higher calling than the one God has given you to invest in that family.
[time=2014] Do that and do that well.
[time=2017] Fathers must confront disobedience.
[time=2020] Let me have your attention turned over to chapter 2, go to chapter 2 verses 22 and 24.
[time=2027] 1 Samuel chapter 2 verses 22 and 24 dads, we must confront disobedience and sin in the lives of our children.
[time=2040] Now Eli was very old.
[time=2042] I'm going to read this to you.
[time=2043] It'll sound like maybe he did a good thing but as we kind of unfold and unpack this passage we'll see that it was a little too little way, way too late.
[time=2054] Now Eli was very old and he heard all that his sons were doing.
[time=2061] As I read this passage, I want you to listen carefully for some phraseology that really might help you see into what was so wrong with this picture.
[time=2072] I've already, I've already said it once but you'll hear it again.
[time=2075] Now Eli was very old and he heard all that his sons were doing to all of Israel.
[time=2082] And how they lay with the women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
[time=2088] He's got sons who are having sex with women who were coming to worship.
[time=2093] These sons who were helping their daddy lie with the ministry of the temple.
[time=2100] And he said to them, "Why do you do such things, the evil things that I hear from all these people?"
[time=2107] "No, my sons, for the report is not good which I hear the Lord's people circulating."
[time=2115] Right out of the gate, what do you pick up as you read through that?
[time=2121] He was hearing about them.
[time=2127] This is their dad and he's hearing things about them.
[time=2134] He's not seeing things, he's not sensing things, he's not noticing things, he's not bumping up against things.
[time=2142] He's not experiencing things in a relationship where there's proximity and understanding and close as no.
[time=2151] He's just hearing gossip for him to hear about his sons and the evil with which they were living.
[time=2159] He has to hear about it on the grapevine.
[time=2165] Now he does confront, but it's as you can sense and as you can read, way too little, way too late.
[time=2173] And as I think about your opportunity, dads, as I think about my opportunity, to confront, to lovingly confront and engage with our kids at a level where disobedience and sin
[time=2186] and disrespect can be addressed and dealt with and helped.
[time=2191] Just a slew of questions came to my mind.
[time=2194] And I'll admit to you up front that just honest questions, I wish these weren't the questions that come to my mind, but they are the questions that come to my mind.
[time=2204] And I bet if you're honest, they are many of them, the same questions that come to yours.
[time=2208] This confrontation of our kids front, why is it so difficult at times to bust our own kids?
[time=2224] Why do I want it to be, why do I want it to be so badly at times your kids' fault and not mine?
[time=2233] Why do I feel that inside of me?
[time=2235] Why will I stop at nothing to make my kid look good?
[time=2240] Why is there that tendency in me to stop at nothing to make my kid somehow look good in this when clearly as I look at it, he was or she was wrong or bad or sinful?
[time=2259] Why do we make so many excuses for our kids?
[time=2265] Why do we do that?
[time=2268] Why do we make so many excuses for our kids?
[time=2270] Why are we so ready to talk about the punishment or our consequences another kid should receive, but when it's our kid we'll let it go?
[time=2283] Why do we with young kids' dads, why do we repeat ourselves 20 times with our 5-year-old and never once do anything about his or her disobedience except get angrier and angrier and angrier the more we repeat ourselves the 16th, 17th and 18th times?
[time=2307] Why do we do that with 5-year-olds? Why do we excuse or look the other way when our 14, 15, 16-year-olds starts walking toward trouble?
[time=2320] Dads, I don't want to ask this question again because of the self-indictment that I experience in asking it, but I've got to ask it this morning.
[time=2328] Dads, why are we even in comparison to our wives at times, why are we especially slow to move?
[time=2339] Why are we especially quiet at times, dads, to speak up and to say what needs to be said to move where we need to move, to act when we need to desperately act?
[time=2357] Why so slow at times to speak the truth, why so slow at times, dad, to confront, even just little things, let alone the bigger issues and struggles of our family?
[time=2371] Well, there could be some answers there. I wrote down a few. We may be dads, we may be slow to speak, we may be slow to act, we may make excuses for our kids, we may just be really unwilling to move in certain directions when it comes to confrontation because maybe we had dads or maybe we had moms that said too much.
[time=2395] It's true that we are a product in many ways of how we were raised, and maybe you grew up with a mom or a dad that was just incessantly on you.
[time=2404] Never, ever, being quiet, you felt like you were always being told something, and so now here you are with your kids and either subconsciously or consciously, you're saying, you know what, I'm not going to do it that way, go have a good time.
[time=2422] Sometimes for dads, myself included, sometimes we're slow to act, sometimes we resist God's call to confront and deal with sin because we're not around very much, back to point one.
[time=2437] And sometimes in your obsession with your job, sometimes with your over commitments and your schedule that is way too busy, sometimes you find yourself away from home and away from these relationships and the couple of hours you finally do get with them, you don't want it to be marked by conflict and confrontation
[time=2461] and the work that's required with discipline, so you just say, you know what, whatever, here's a candy bar.
[time=2473] Loving discipline and confrontation, you know what, loving discipline and confrontation takes an enormous amount of time and energy, and sometimes you don't do it just because you're lazy.
[time=2484] You'd rather give enormous amounts of time and energy to other endeavors than this one, and so you just don't, you do not roll up your sleeves and do the hard, hard, arduous work of parenting because you're tired.
[time=2501] And you'd rather sit, you'd rather listen, you'd rather watch, you'd rather play, I've been there, I understand that.
[time=2511] Sometimes we tend to approach this issue of confrontation, fourth thing I wrote down, sometimes we tend to approach this issue of confrontation and as dads being engaged, sometimes as dads we parent like this.
[time=2530] Sometimes we kind of see what, we kind of see how Jim's handling it.
[time=2538] Sometimes we kind of look around and kind of see how Frank's handling it.
[time=2542] Sometimes as guys we have this weird thing where we get real comparative and we don't want to step out too far on a limb and somehow look different, somehow be alone.
[time=2554] Sometimes guys don't like being alone, they like being kind of status quo, and we can't do that.
[time=2561] Sometimes we resist what God has called us to on this front because we're afraid of what others will think, we're afraid of what others might say.
[time=2571] I've been there, I understand that, I know sometimes that's the case.
[time=2576] Whether it's a five-year-old or a seventeen-year-old, my friends, dads, our sons and daughters desperately need us to step into their lives.
[time=2588] Be close enough first of all to step and having stepped be willing to confront what needs to be confronted, address what needs to be addressed, establish new parameters, bring consequences where important and where needed.
[time=2605] And you and I can think of a lot of reasons why sometimes we don't and all of them fall short when it comes to the standard that God has given us to lovingly engage and lovingly confront.
[time=2616] Why is it so important? Number three, write it down because when fathers don't, and we see it right here in this passage, when fathers don't confront disobedience and sin, my goodness, the consequences are not only inevitable, but they are tragic.
[time=2633] Look at 1 Samuel 3, it says there in 1 Samuel 3, 10.
[time=2640] 1 Samuel 3, 10, then the Lord came and stood and called us, called us at other times, Samuel, Samuel.
[time=2647] And Samuel said, "Speak for your servant is listening." And the Lord said to Samuel, "Behold, I'm about to do a thing in Israel at which both ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.
[time=2659] In that day I will carry out against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house from beginning to end, for I have told him that I am about to judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew.
[time=2674] See, he knew these things were going on. He knew this stuff was happening.
[time=2678] We see him confront it in 22, but he knew it was going on.
[time=2683] He was aware of their wandering. He was aware of their failure. He was aware of their sin and disrespect for others and for God, and he did nothing.
[time=2695] You can't do nothing. You have to do something.
[time=2705] 1 Samuel 3, right there.
[time=2710] In that day I will carry out verse 12 against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house from beginning to end, for I have told him that I am about to judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew because his sons brought a curse on themselves and he did not rebuke them.
[time=2730] Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.
[time=2740] Go to chapter 4 verse 12. 1 Samuel chapter 4, 12.
[time=2745] Here now it has happened the battle with the Philistines has occurred.
[time=2750] Now a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn and dust on his head.
[time=2757] When he came behold Eli was sitting on his seat by the road eagerly watching because his heart was trembling for the ark of God.
[time=2767] So the man came to tell it in the city and all the city cried out.
[time=2772] When Eli heard the noise of the outcry he said what does the noise of this commotion mean then the man came hurriedly and told Eli, now Eli was 98 years old and his eyes were set so he could not see.
[time=2785] The man said to Eli I am the one who came from the battle line and indeed I escaped from the battle line today.
[time=2792] And Eli said how did things go my son and the one who brought the news replied.
[time=2799] Israel has fled before the Philistines and there has also been a great slaughter among the people and your two sons Haphne and Finneas are dead.
[time=2810] And the ark of the covenant the ark of God has been taken.
[time=2815] When he mentioned the ark of God Eli fell off the seat backward beside the gate and his neck was broken and he died for he was old and heavy.
[time=2827] Thus he judged Israel 40 years.
[time=2832] Now listen there will be as you know and I know there will be consequences for your sons and your daughters sin.
[time=2842] You can't save them or keep them from all of it all the time nor should we.
[time=2848] But what you can do is develop a pattern of not letting even the little things go in an effort to keep them bent and leaning toward what's true and right and good.
[time=2861] You can confront them and bring discipline now and in doing so possibly avoid the deal breakers the heart breakers the calamity that can come later.
[time=2874] You can possibly avoid these things there is no guarantee I'm not proposing this morning that there's a way you can parent as a father.
[time=2882] It would guarantee that there would be no calamity in your daughter or son's life that they would always choose what is right because you fathered a certain way.
[time=2891] Of course I'm not saying that but what I'm saying is it is good for you and it is good for me and it is good for them for us to faithfully lead and love them in this way to develop patterns that can help them.
[time=2906] And that can steer them in the right direction Proverbs 19-18 I love how this is written Proverbs 19-18 you'll see it there on the screen.
[time=2917] Discipline your son while there is hope while there is hope while there's time and please don't be fooled into thinking that somehow 18 means there's no more time.
[time=2930] Don't connect an age to this necessarily discipline your son discipline your daughter while there is hope and do not desire his death.
[time=2942] Well every parent in the room reads that and goes are you kidding me I would never I would never desire his or her death would you raise your hand right.
[time=2952] Yeah nobody's going to desire you're thinking I would never desire their death and what God's word says to you and I this morning is then discipline them because if you don't they'll die.
[time=2966] Discipline them do it lovingly do it faithfully do it tenderly do it forth rightly but bring to their life the correction and the parameters that God gave you to give to them so they can the Scripture says so they can.
[time=2981] Live I love Hebrews 12 you can turn back toward the back of your New Testament just before you get to the book of James is the book of Hebrews go to Hebrews 12-7 it says in Hebrews 12-7 it is for discipline that you endure.
[time=3001] God deals with you as with sons this is how God comes at it so it's how you and I should come at it God deals with you as with sons for what son is there whom his father does not discipline.
[time=3014] For if you are without discipline of which all have become partakers then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
[time=3022] Furthermore we had earthly fathers to discipline us and we respected them you understand that right when you disciplined them when you lovingly yet faithfully correct it instills not resistance in them but respect.
[time=3041] They respect you when you're willing to walk that road shall we not much rather be subject to the father of spirits and live for they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them but he God disciplines us for our good so that we may share his holiness.
[time=3062] All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful but sorrowful yet to those who have been trained by it afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.
[time=3078] The peaceful fruit of righteousness available to your sons and daughters and mine when you and I are willing to live in proximity to be engaged to work hard but not too much to not lose sight of them and the privilege and the gift that they are.
[time=3100] To be involved and engaged to the point where you're able to see and sense and detect things not because you hear it from people but because you you see it.
[time=3110] You can touch it it's right there in front of you because you're there with them and you're willing to confront sin you're willing to confront the things that aren't as they should be and to do it lovingly and to do it with purpose.
[time=3127] Hey just a few things as we go home this morning.
[time=3130] Just some fathering truth to take home I'm so thankful these things have been passed along to me over the years.
[time=3136] Just some practical things that I want you as dads to keep in mind as we come away from our text this morning be affectionate.
[time=3144] Number one would you write that down here's something for you to hold on to and take home with you this week.
[time=3149] Dads in the room dads of young boys and girls dads of older boys and girls be affectionate and I know there are guys in the room who will look at me and say well you know what I'm just not.
[time=3162] I'm just not very affectionate and to you I would say I understand that there's probably reasons why you're not.
[time=3172] You need to be be affectionate your daughters need it from you dads or they'll sometimes wander and look for it elsewhere.
[time=3188] Your daughters need your tender appropriate affection your daughters need to be loved and hugged and cared for they need their hands held by you for a long long time.
[time=3207] My daughters get tired of hearing this and the only one that's going to do all that stuff with you for a long long time.
[time=3217] Guys dads your daughters need your affection you need a little help you need a little encouragement we can talk about it we can help you we can encourage you.
[time=3229] Hey dads your sons listen and again I know you may not have been raised this way but your sons need your affection it's a little different maybe than with the daughters but nonetheless they need a hug.
[time=3242] They need your arms around them and with the sun it can kind of go different directions you know you can yank their ear you can throw them down the backyard and sit on them you know you can do all kinds of fun stuff with them but they need your touch.
[time=3258] Doesn't go so well sometimes for boys who never had his touch never had his love never had his affection dads be affectionate teach them secondly teach them about God so they can know God.

[time=3294] progress and the word of God getting into them and the word of God being made clear and the word of God being made interesting you don't need a master's degree from seminary to do this.
[time=3305] It's on you have a plan teach them about God so they can know God judges 210 one of the scariest most tragic verses in all of scripture we've read it before all that generation also were gathered to their fathers and that generation was the generation that had been delivered
[time=3328] delivered from Egypt that was the generation that had witnessed and experienced firsthand all the miracles of God and they had kids and that generation that had experienced all of that went to be with their fathers in heaven and their arose immediately
[time=3345] behind them another generation after them who did not know the Lord not only did they not know the Lord they didn't even know the things he had done nor yet the work which he had done for Israel.
[time=3362] We can't let that happen you can't let your kids not know you can't let your kids not learn you can't not invest in them so they can get a glimpse of the God who saved you and me amen.
[time=3379] With great love and affection discipline early and often with great love and affection discipline early and often.
