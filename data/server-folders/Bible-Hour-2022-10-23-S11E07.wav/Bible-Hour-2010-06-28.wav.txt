[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] It's great to have you with us and I'm so thankful for the message that you're gonna hear today from our good friend, Josh Rang.
[time=42] Josh is a part of our family here at Black Hawk, used to be part of our pastoral staff, now part of the business community here in this area.
[time=51] And I'm so thankful for Josh and Paula and their family and he's gonna continue on in our series that we're engaged in this summer.
[time=59] Real stories, real lives, lessons learned from the very pages of scripture and today he comes with the message and the story of the Apostle Paul.
[time=69] And so I'm sure you'll be encouraged, I'm sure you'll be challenged.
[time=72] And I wanna remind you to go to the website about Wednesday and download this following week's Digging Deeper Material, a chance for you to hear Josh today on the broadcast and then go to the website and download the digging deeper material that will help you apply and better understand and further dialogue and think through with this message on Paul.
[time=96] It really has been helped to so many people and I hope you'll enjoy the message and I hope you'll benefit from the digging deeper material.
[time=105] Hey, I wanna just tell you this.
[time=106] For those of you who live in the Fort Wayne area, we're trying something this summer that we're finding to be very, very meaningful and that is during our first hour, it's what we call it here, the nine o'clock hour.
[time=119] We're actually sending teams out into our neighborhood in our community to do service projects, to help people who have real physical needs in their homes, on their property.
[time=129] And we would love to hear from you if you've got a need that we could fix.
[time=133] It may be plumbing, it may be some small amounts of construction, it may be some cleanup, there may be some painting that needs to be done, some kind of repair work.
[time=143] If there's a need that you've got, I'd love for you to contact us here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=148] Here's our website, here's our phone number.
[time=151] You can call the church office and let them know of a physical need that you've got.
[time=155] We would love to send some people out to minister to you to help you and encourage you.
[time=160] We're thankful for each and every one of you.
[time=162] We say it all the time.
[time=163] We want you to be like family with us and serving you in a real tangible way.
[time=169] Might just be an opportunity for us to get to know you better and for you to get to know us.
[time=174] Thank you for allowing us that privilege.
[time=177] Thank you for tuning in this week.
[time=179] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=181] God bless.
[time=182] [MUSIC - 97 seconds]
[time=281] You know it's about, it was about 15 years ago.
[time=285] I was doing the math this morning.
[time=288] It was about 15 years ago that Cabra and I were the little red-headed toddler in tow out in California.
[time=295] It got to meet a young guy and his wife newly married named Josh and Paula Rang.
[time=302] You see Josh had grown up in Fort Wayne, grew up right here at Blackhawk.
[time=307] Went to Blackhawk Christian School, you know, from the very beginning, was a part of this church family.
[time=314] He and his mom and dad, his brothers, I mean, this was home for Josh.
[time=318] And in his relationship with the pastor here at Blackhawk, then Russell Moore, Josh got encouraged after graduating from Cedarville, go Jackets.
[time=327] Josh got encouraged to come out to the master's seminary in Los Angeles, which is where we were.
[time=333] So Josh, who I'd kind of gotten to know a little bit through Russ, shows up in LA, he and Paula, all alone, a car that didn't work, a house, a little tiny little apartment they were trying to move into.
[time=345] And Cabra and I had the privilege of getting to meet them and kind of come alongside.
[time=350] We left for Indiana about a year later, and Josh suffered in the beauty of Southern California.
[time=357] And from there on, went on to a number of different churches.
[time=361] God used him in some really, really significant and encouraging ways over the years.
[time=366] He joined our staff several years ago, served here for a couple of years.
[time=371] And then God led he and Paula to make a transition to ministry outside these four walls, if you will, into the marketplace.
[time=379] And Josh is giving himself to that full-time these days, but still a part of our family and still very gifted and very able to teach and communicate the great truths of God's Word.
[time=389] So he is here this morning, and I'm so thankful that he's here to continue in our series on Lessons Learned from the real lives and real stories of the Bible.
[time=399] Today, Josh comes to teach us about what we can learn from the life of Paul.
[time=403] Would you give a real warm Black Hawk welcome to Josh Ring?
[time=406] (Applause)
[time=414] Well, first service, we were over in the chapel, and it was interesting, in that chapel, some 20-some years ago, in the pew just to my right, is where the kindness of God, specifically in its salvation moment, came to me, and where I responded to the gospel message.
[time=437] And it's very gracious of God to allow me to have an opportunity to come back and be a part of this place.
[time=445] And so I'm just really grateful.
[time=447] And it was fun to be able to speak in the chapel that God used somebody in that chapel to save me.
[time=456] And so that was a real privilege.
[time=458] It's a real privilege to be with you this morning, and I'm grateful for that.
[time=461] Also, just grateful for Kelly as he shared in California.
[time=464] He has been and continues to be just a very good friend, great friend, to Paula and to me, and we're just grateful for that.
[time=472] I told him, "Yeah, the car wasn't working well at all when we moved out to California.
[time=475] We used to have to turn on the heater in the middle of the day to take the heat off the engine.
[time=480] So you can imagine, on the summer day in California, it was 95 degrees, and we would have the heater going on full blast, the windows down, and it was just an interesting time.
[time=491] But anyway, I'm grateful to be here, and we're going to go right into it.
[time=495] Lessons from the life of Paul.
[time=498] Much of what I've been learning in the last probably five to ten years, and much of what I'm going to share this morning comes from two influences in my life, and I think it's important to say that.
[time=506] First is a gentleman named Mike Bolmore, who was a pastor in Wisconsin.
[time=511] The other is a gentleman named CJ Mahaney, and those two people, two men of God, have been at huge influences in my life, and they helped me to understand a little bit more and more of what Paul kind of was important to Paul, and so that's what we're going to look at this morning, and the two lessons real quick are this.
[time=530] There was nothing more important than the gospel to Paul.
[time=535] The second one, the second lesson from Paul's writings would be this.
[time=539] There's also nothing more practical than the gospel to Paul.
[time=546] So those are the two lessons we're going to look at, and let's just pray real quick.
[time=550] Father, thank you so much, again, for your word.
[time=554] Lord, I'm humbled at the opportunity, and again, I'm aware of just the great responsibility and also the great privilege to speak your word, and it is my prayer, God, that you would just open our eyes to see wonderful things from your truth, and we eagerly anticipate the work of your spirit to fasten these truths to our hearts and to our minds.
[time=576] And we pray this in the Son, your Son's name, Jesus Christ, amen.
[time=582] Well, three introductory thoughts real quick before we jump into those two lessons.
[time=586] The first one is this.
[time=587] We need to understand what the gospel is before we begin talking about the gospel.
[time=593] What is the gospel?
[time=595] And again, a friendly, helpful way to remember that.
[time=597] It can be remembered on one hand, and it's this.
[time=600] Christ died for our sins.
[time=604] That is the essence of the gospel.
[time=606] It can be unpacked further from there, but that really is the gospel message.
[time=610] It's the person and work of Christ.
[time=613] Secondly, we need to understand how Paul used the gospel.
[time=617] If that's the gospel message, how did he use it?
[time=620] And I believe that as you look throughout Scripture, Paul used it in two different ways.
[time=624] One, he used it as an instrument to save sinners.
[time=630] We understand that.
[time=631] That's kind of the idea of our justification.
[time=634] When we come to find out that we're sinners before a mighty God and that we need a Savior, is Jesus Christ, and there's a justifying moment there where we're declared righteous
[time=645] based upon the merits of Christ.
[time=647] But there's a second way that he used it.
[time=649] Not only did Paul use it as an instrument to save sinners, but he also used it as an instrument to sanctify believers.
[time=657] The word sanctification is basically this idea that now that we're saved, that God continues to grow us.
[time=664] He continues to mature us.
[time=666] That's this word sanctification.
[time=668] So there were times when Paul spoke the gospel for evangelistic purposes to save unbelievers.
[time=674] There were other times when he would unpack the gospel to grow and empower believers,
[time=681] anticipating that the gospel would bear fruit in their lives.
[time=687] Let me give you an example of that.
[time=689] It's in Colossians chapter 1, and I'm going to start reading in verse 3.
[time=693] It says, "We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love which you have for all the saints." So he is speaking to Christians.
[time=706] The context here is that he's speaking to believers, and he says this, "Because of the
[time=712] hope laid up for you in heaven, of which you previously heard in the word of truth, the gospel." Now this gospel, verse 6, "has come to you just as in all the world also, it constantly
[time=724] bearing fruit and increasing, even as it has been doing in you, since the day you heard
[time=733] of it and understood the grace of God and truth." See what he's saying there?
[time=738] There was a point in time when they heard and understood the gospel, and since that point
[time=744] that gospel has been continually bearing fruit in their lives.
[time=749] The gospel has been used to mature them and develop them in their lives as believers.
[time=758] So we need to understand what the gospel is.
[time=760] We need to understand how Paul used the gospel in two different ways.
[time=764] And then third, we need to be aware of the temptation which exists for Christians to
[time=770] dismiss the usefulness of the gospel after our conversion to Christ.
[time=778] We're tempted to confine the gospel to that first way that Paul used it.
[time=783] We're tempted to confine the gospel to our justification only without realizing our need
[time=790] for it, our desperate need for it as believers.
[time=795] And the reality is that this has been going on for a long time, this temptation to not see the gospel as beneficial to us as believers.
[time=805] It happened back in 60 AD when Paul spoke to the believers in Galatia.
[time=811] And here's what he said.
[time=812] He says, "You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you before whose eyes Jesus Christ
[time=818] was publicly portrayed as crucified?" And in verse 2 he says this, "This is the only thing I want to know from you.
[time=825] Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?"
[time=831] That phrase, "receive the Spirit" basically means coming to Christ.
[time=837] Having been justified, they received the gift of the Spirit in their lives.
[time=840] So they were saved.
[time=841] So he wants to know this one thing.
[time=844] Did you become saved by the works of the law, by your own merits?
[time=849] Or by hearing with faith, by the merits of Christ?
[time=852] We know the question, right?
[time=853] We know the answer to that question, simply, utterly, wholly dependent upon the merits of Christ.
[time=859] Then he goes on and says this, "Are you so foolish having begun by the Spirit, being
[time=865] saved, are you now being perfected, sanctified by the flesh?"
[time=872] Of course not.
[time=874] See what Paul is saying is this, and he said it back in 60 AD, he said, "The same gospel that justifies us is the same gospel that sanctifies us.
[time=886] It's powerful in our lives as believers." Just a few years later in 2 Timothy chapter 2, verse 8, Timothy was Paul's true son in
[time=898] the faith.
[time=899] It was somebody that he invested his life in, and in 2 Timothy this is Paul's final letter
[time=907] that he wrote.
[time=908] It was his last letter, and he wrote it to his son in the faith, Timothy, and he says this in 2 Timothy 2, 8, "Timothy, remember Jesus Christ."
[time=920] Don't you find that little phrase a little bit odd?
[time=922] I mean, Paul had spent years with Timothy, conversation after conversation in a discipleship
[time=931] relationship, and he's leaving, and the last thing, one of the last things that he wants to tell Timothy is, "Timothy, do not forget Jesus Christ."
[time=943] In 1973, John Stott commented on this verse, and he said this, "All around us we see Christians
[time=949] and churches relaxing their grasp on the gospel, fumbling it, in danger of letting it
[time=955] drop from their hands altogether." And just a few short letters, years after that in 2006, a pastor named Milton Vincent said this about the same topic.
[time=966] He said, "A costly mistake made by Christians is that we view the gospel Christ died for
[time=974] our sins as something that has fully served out its purpose the moment we believed in Jesus for salvation.
[time=982] Not knowing what to do with the gospel, once we're saved, he says, "We lay it aside soon
[time=988] after conversion so we can move on to bigger and better things, even scriptural things."
[time=996] So there is a temptation for Christians to confine the gospel to the saving event of justification.
[time=1006] Praise God for that saving event, right?
[time=1009] Praise God for the message that justifies us, but we are tempted to dismiss it to only
[time=1016] that, and what Paul is saying is that it is powerful to bear fruit in our lives as believers.
[time=1024] So I believe that Paul's lessons will train us how to make the gospel more than just spiritual jargon, more than just a phrase that's stated or an event that took place in our lives back
[time=1036] when we were saved, but that it would be the power source of everything we do, and that on a daily basis the gospel Christ and his work on our behalf would bear much fruit in
[time=1047] our lives as believers.
[time=1051] So with those introductory thoughts kind of behind us, let's dive into the two lessons that Paul shares with us.
[time=1058] Number one, there was nothing more important than the gospel to Paul.
[time=1063] Let's look at his words, and again, note the context here.
[time=1067] The first one is 1 Corinthians 15, and in 1 Corinthians again, he's speaking to the believers
[time=1074] at Corinth, and yes, they were messed up and they had many different issues, but he says that they were believers.
[time=1080] And here's what he says in 1 Corinthians 15, 3, he says, "I delivered to you that which was of first importance, that Christ died for our sins."
[time=1095] He uses that phrase of first importance, nowhere else but here.
[time=1099] So for Paul, what he's saying is there was no other message which was more important than the gospel.
[time=1106] There was no other event more important than Calvary.
[time=1110] There is no greater person of interest, greater than Jesus Christ.
[time=1117] There was nothing more important than the gospel to Paul.
[time=1120] He says it a different way in Galatians 6, verse 14.
[time=1125] He says, "May it be that I would never boast in anything except," there's one thing, Jesus
[time=1136] Christ and him crucified.
[time=1139] What's that little phrase referring to?
[time=1140] The gospel, Galatians 6, 14.
[time=1143] So in all of his endeavors, in all of his pursuits, in all that his life was about, he
[time=1152] would say there's only one thing to boast about.
[time=1155] There's really only one thing that matters.
[time=1157] That's the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1161] Philippians 3, again, a context two believers to the church of Philippi.
[time=1165] In 3-3-8, the context there is that there were those that were taking confidence in
[time=1171] their own achievements.
[time=1173] And he rattles off this list of achievements of his own, that he was a Pharisee, that he
[time=1179] was of the tribe of Benjamin.
[time=1180] As to zeal, he persecuted the church.
[time=1182] All of these things that basically kind of put the other people in a lower seat because of all that he had done for Christ.
[time=1189] And here's what he says in verse 7 and 8, he says, "But I consider all of that, all of those things that would put me ahead of you, I consider all of that loss to knowing
[time=1201] Christ." There was nothing more important to Paul than the person of Christ and what he accomplished.
[time=1208] In fact, one more passage in 1 Corinthians 15, 14 through 17.
[time=1215] We won't take the time to look at it directly, but in there, he's talking about the resurrection of Jesus.
[time=1220] And again, the death, burial, and resurrection are all a part of the gospel.
[time=1225] And he says in 1 Corinthians 15 that if the resurrection never happened, if it never took
[time=1232] place, then your faith and my faith, he says, would be vain and it would be worthless.
[time=1241] We would still be stuck in our sins.
[time=1246] You see that the gospel, the gospel is the foundation to our entire belief system.
[time=1255] We can go out of these walls and we can live a life to our best behavior.
[time=1259] And yet if the gospel never happened, if we never submit to Christ, we're going to be moral people who had the hell forever.
[time=1268] See there was nothing more important than the gospel to Paul.
[time=1272] In fact, it goes on forever, an interesting note.
[time=1276] In the book of Revelation, the last book that talks about into eternity, do you know how
[time=1282] Jesus is referred to more than any other name or any other reference?
[time=1288] Jesus is referred to in the book of Revelation 16 times as the lamb, the lamb that was slain.
[time=1298] He's identified in the book of Revelation on into eternity as the one who suffered in
[time=1304] blood at Calvary.
[time=1307] There's nothing, nothing more important than the gospel to Paul.
[time=1312] The center of our lives should be the person and work of Christ.
[time=1315] In fact, Paul says in other passages that the gospel or the person of Christ, there's
[time=1321] unsearchable riches.
[time=1324] So you can gaze at Christ over and over again and never come to the end of it.
[time=1328] You can study Calvary and the ramifications of that and never come to an end of it.
[time=1335] It's unsearchable.
[time=1338] So understanding its importance, the next question is what place should then it have in our lives?
[time=1347] Which is the second point.
[time=1349] Not only is there nothing more important than the gospel to Paul, but secondly, there was nothing more practical than the gospel to Paul.
[time=1358] And when we think of practical, we all need help, right?
[time=1365] I mean, it's not easy to read God's Word and then go out and do it.
[time=1369] And so there are specific areas of instruction in the Bible that tell us how we're supposed to live and what we're supposed to do.
[time=1376] And those things are, yes, indeed, very practical.
[time=1380] However, I would argue, and I think what Paul would argue is that there is a step behind that, and that is this, that understanding how the gospel impacts our lives as believers
[time=1392] is more important, is more practical than anything else.
[time=1397] Because it impacts the way that we behave.
[time=1401] It influences the way that we think.
[time=1404] And that's what we're going to talk about here.
[time=1405] There's basically two ways that it's practical.
[time=1407] It's practical in our thinking and it's practical in our behaving.
[time=1412] First of all, our thinking.
[time=1415] The gospel is what the spirit uses to produce right thinking in our lives as believers.
[time=1422] These are what are called gospel truths.
[time=1425] In 1 Timothy 1, 11, Paul says that there is sound teaching or there is doctrine that conforms to the gospel.
[time=1433] In other words, these are truths that take their shape from the gospel.
[time=1439] One other way to say it is this.
[time=1441] If the gospel never happened, these things would not be true.
[time=1447] In other words, these truths are completely and wholly dependent upon the person and work of Christ.
[time=1455] Romans 5, 1.
[time=1456] Give you three examples.
[time=1457] The first one is Romans 5, 1.
[time=1458] It says, "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God."
[time=1465] The truth there is this, that we have peace with God.
[time=1468] But what's it dependent upon?
[time=1470] "Therefore, having been justified by faith." That phrase, "Having been justified by faith," speaks specifically to the person and work of Christ.
[time=1479] There's no other way to be justified by faith.
[time=1482] It's only through Christ.
[time=1483] So the peace with God comes through the gospel.
[time=1487] Second, Romans 8, 1 is another one.
[time=1489] It says, "Therefore, there is now," keyword, "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for
[time=1496] those who are in Christ Jesus." What is he talking about being in Christ Jesus?
[time=1501] Well, that comes because of what happened at Calvary.
[time=1505] Having been justified by faith, we receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1509] We're in Christ.
[time=1513] Because of that, there is now different from what used to be, there is now no condemnation.
[time=1519] So before Christ came in, guess what?
[time=1522] The very wrath of God, the condemnation of God rested upon us as sinners.
[time=1535] Says in the Bible that God is angry at sinners every day, that the wrath of God abides upon
[time=1542] us apart from Christ.
[time=1545] And yet what this verse is telling us is that because of Christ, because of what He's accomplished,
[time=1555] for those of you, for me who have put our faith and trust in Christ and Christ alone,
[time=1561] we don't get that wrath anymore.
[time=1564] That condemnation is not for us.
[time=1566] It was completely and utterly spent poured out on Christ at Calvary.
[time=1574] Praise the Lord.
[time=1575] Romans 8-1, because the gospel happened, there's no condemnation now for us.
[time=1581] Romans 8-32 is one of my favorite verses, and it is gospel language as well.
[time=1584] It says this, "He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all."
[time=1590] What's that talking about?
[time=1592] The gospel, right?
[time=1594] The next phrase is this, "How will he not also freely give us all things in him?"
[time=1601] See the logic of this verse, it's amazing.
[time=1603] If God went to such an extent to slay his son to save us, what makes us ever think that
[time=1610] He's going to give up on us?
[time=1612] If He justified us, He's going to sanctify us.
[time=1617] And the gospel is proof of it.
[time=1621] This is gospel truth.
[time=1623] But guess what?
[time=1624] If the gospel had not happened, we would have no idea of God's disposition toward us.
[time=1629] In fact, He would not be for us, He would be against us.
[time=1633] It's gospel truth.
[time=1636] So the question is, what should these verses do, or how should they function in our lives?
[time=1643] I see, you know, you may be seeing, Josh, I see the connection between the gospel and those truths, but really, how is that practical?
[time=1652] Great question.
[time=1653] These truths are practical because they speak against enemies which attack our thinking,
[time=1660] and this happens every day.
[time=1664] Every day, daily, daily, daily, not seasonally, not monthly, not occasionally, but daily,
[time=1672] we battle enemies which attack our thinking.
[time=1674] I'm going to give you three of those.
[time=1676] It's not an exhaustive list by any means, but it will be helpful for us to understand how the gospel is practical in our thinking.
[time=1683] The first one is condemnation, condemnation.
[time=1687] For most of us, condemnation is a common experience, and for too many of us, condemnation
[time=1695] is a constant companion.
[time=1699] When you sin throughout the day, quick on the heels of that sin is condemnation and guilt,
[time=1707] right?
[time=1708] I mean, we've all experienced.
[time=1710] We know Satan wants to just make us understand that we're miserable, that we're worthless,
[time=1716] and that condemnation comes.
[time=1719] We feel like we have 300 pounds of luggage, and we live more aware of this 300 pounds
[time=1725] of luggage than we do of the saving work of Christ, the gospel.
[time=1731] Too many of us are more familiar with condemnation than with justification.
[time=1737] So how do you know if you're carrying baggage today?
[time=1740] How do you know if you're struggling with this?
[time=1742] Well, you keep a respectful distance from God.
[time=1746] You feel like God has disappointed with you rather than delighting over you and his son.
[time=1751] You view God as just simply tolerating you.
[time=1754] You feel like you're on probation even though you can vent, confess your sin.
[time=1760] You feel kind of like, "I got in on the group plan." Kelly said a prayer, and there was a bunch of us in the room, and at that point I just kind of set a prayer, and I felt like I just got in, because everybody else got in at that point.
[time=1774] You live with low-grade, unresolved guilt.
[time=1779] You rarely experience joy.
[time=1784] You know, that's me on a daily basis.
[time=1788] I know we battle with that daily, and here's how this gets practical.
[time=1793] Romans 8-1, "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ."
[time=1802] As we battle condemnation, guess what attacks it at its root?
[time=1807] The gospel, the person and work of Christ.
[time=1811] For Jesus to say, "No, don't carry that around, because I've already taken care of it at the cross." Let's not let condemnation, let's not let guilt ruin, ruin our lives.
[time=1828] It's done.
[time=1829] It's over.
[time=1831] There is no condemnation for us.
[time=1836] Conviction, on the other hand, is a great thing, right?
[time=1840] Because what conviction should do for us, rather than condemnation, conviction should move us closer to Christ to Calvary and to confess our sin and deal with it and understand
[time=1850] what has happened with it that it has removed as far as the east is from the west.
[time=1856] Condemnation is gone, conviction is a gift of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1859] Second, legalism.
[time=1862] Legalism is seeking to achieve forgiveness from God or justification before God and acceptance
[time=1869] by God through our obedience to God.
[time=1874] Legalism is about achieving.
[time=1876] The gospel is about receiving.
[time=1879] Legalism is about promoting yourself.
[time=1881] The gospel is about promoting Christ.
[time=1885] Legalism is our attempt to add or substitute our works for Christ's finished work.
[time=1894] It's thinking that our performance determines God's disposition toward us.
[time=1900] We experience that on a daily basis.
[time=1902] We have, you know, it's the good day, bad day mentality, right?
[time=1906] When you're having a good day, you feel like things are going well.
[time=1910] You woke up early, you spent time with the Lord, you were in the Word, you were praying, you went to work, you got an opportunity to share the gospel.
[time=1918] Things were humming along, right?
[time=1921] You feel like God is really pleased with you.
[time=1927] Based upon what?
[time=1928] Based upon your performance.
[time=1931] God must be really pleased with me today because, you know, I'm preaching.
[time=1935] So he's got to be happy with me, right?
[time=1937] I'm having a good day.
[time=1940] Bad day, example.
[time=1943] The alarm goes off, you hit snooze, you don't spend time with the Lord, you're off to work.
[time=1948] Things aren't going well.
[time=1952] How do you feel at that point?
[time=1954] You're sinning left and right, just not feeling like you're in fellowship with the Lord.
[time=1959] The opposite can be true as well, right?
[time=1961] You feel like somehow that God is angered at you, that you have condemnation or guilt that goes with you.
[time=1967] So let me ask you, at that point, has God's disposition changed toward you?
[time=1973] No.
[time=1974] Why?
[time=1977] Because God's attitude toward you and God's disposition toward you is solely and wholly
[time=1984] dependent upon the merits of Christ, not yours, good or bad.
[time=1991] Yeah, that's awesome.
[time=1993] Now, I will say this, that when we sin, there are consequences to that sin and there is discipline
[time=2002] from God, to get us back into fellowship with Him, and sometimes there can be a distance in that fellowship, not because of Him, but because of us.
[time=2013] And so there is no condemnation, there is no wrath.
[time=2019] So you may be thinking, is there, is he angry at me?
[time=2022] I know specifically, the Bible says no condemnation.
[time=2025] The wrath was our spent, but is he angry toward me?
[time=2029] I don't believe he is, when you're in Christ.
[time=2033] I think God's disposition toward you is completely and wholly as a father to a child, who yes
[time=2040] disciplines you, but that discipline is not anger.
[time=2045] I guarantee you, when I am disciplining my children, if there is anger in my heart, something
[time=2051] is wrong, right?
[time=2055] Nothing is wrong if I'm disciplining my kids and there's anger in my heart.
[time=2061] To translate that to God, there's no anger when he disciplines us.
[time=2065] It's out of love for us, and again, there are consequences, there is discipline.
[time=2072] It may not feel good for a while, but it's not that he's angry at us, it's not that our relationship with him has changed, there's no condemnation.
[time=2086] Romans 5 1 says there is peace with God.
[time=2091] The gospel attacks that legalism at its core.
[time=2095] A third one is unbelief.
[time=2096] You know, sometimes it is a daily battle to believe that God is good.
[time=2103] It is a daily battle to believe that God has our best interest in mind.
[time=2110] That's been true ever since the Garden of Eden.
[time=2114] When Satan came to Eve and lied to her and said, you know what?
[time=2119] God did not say that you shouldn't eat from, or God didn't say that you will die.
[time=2125] He lied to her.
[time=2128] And when he lied to her, what happened is this, it caused her to now doubt.
[time=2134] Is God really good?
[time=2137] Or is God somehow withholding something from me?
[time=2140] Because that tree looks really good to me, and that fruit will probably taste really good.
[time=2148] So Eve starts to doubt God, just like we do today.
[time=2153] That event or that activity or that pursuit, that somehow we think is going to make us
[time=2159] so happy and yet God says, you know what, don't go that way.
[time=2164] Because if you go that way, it's not going to go well for you.
[time=2168] And doubt slips in an unbelief.
[time=2172] And Romans 8 32 sneaks in and attacks that unbelief, that he who did not spare his own
[time=2180] son but gave him up for us all.
[time=2182] How will he not also freely give us all things in him?
[time=2185] You see, the proof of God's care for us, the proof that God has our best interest at mind is the gospel, that he went to such an extent to save us by slaying his son.
[time=2200] We can know without a shadow of a doubt that he's for us.
[time=2204] He's not against us.
[time=2206] He's not a cosmic killjoy in heaven, just keeping things from us that he knows will make us happy.
[time=2212] He wants our best for us.
[time=2215] And the gospel is proof of that.
[time=2219] So there is nothing more practical than the gospel.
[time=2227] First of all, when we think about our thinking, it attacks that unbelief, it attacks condemnation,
[time=2234] it attacks legalism at its core.
[time=2238] But secondly, the gospel is what the spirit uses to produce right living.
[time=2245] We call this gospel behavior.
[time=2247] Philippians 1, 27, Paul says, "conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel."
[time=2254] Which means to live your life in a way that it reflects the gospel, that your behavior takes its fuel from the gospel, its motivation from the gospel.
[time=2266] In other words, because the gospel occurred, or because Christ died for our sins, we have the greatest, not the only, but we have the greatest motivation for our behavior as Christians.
[time=2278] It is the purpose.
[time=2279] Let me give you some examples real quick, Titus 3, 1 through 5 says this.
[time=2285] Paul speaking to Titus, he says, "Remind them Christians to be subject to rulers, to authorities,
[time=2291] to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed, to malign no one, to be peaceable,
[time=2297] gentle, showing every consideration for all men." All of that is behaviors that God is telling us to do to others, right?
[time=2308] Moral imperatives.
[time=2309] Here's what you should do out there in the world.
[time=2311] And then he says this in verse 3, 4, purpose clause, do all of that because you also once
[time=2322] were foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending your life in malice and envy and hate, hating one another.
[time=2333] But when the kindness of God our Savior appeared, and his love for mankind appeared, he saved
[time=2339] us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done, but by his mercy.
[time=2346] Do you see those first two verses?
[time=2349] The purpose, the motivation comes from our own understanding of what God has done for
[time=2355] us, and out of our understanding of what God has done for us, now we are to treat people in that same way.
[time=2361] There's a gospel connection, it's gospel truth, gospel behavior.
[time=2367] That one is in 1 Corinthians 6, 18 through 20, we're not going to turn there, but it says this, that passage is about purity.
[time=2374] It's about understanding that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2379] And so he says there that you are to conduct yourselves with purity.
[time=2383] And he says this at the end, he says, "For you honor God with your body for you were bought
[time=2391] with a price." Remember what that price was?
[time=2397] It was the person of Christ at Calvary.
[time=2402] And so because of what he's done for you, now honor God with your body.
[time=2408] There's another one, they're all over Scripture.
[time=2412] But giving, we gave of our tithes, tithes and offerings this morning already.
[time=2416] But in 1 Corinthians, actually 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, he's speaking to the church.
[time=2422] And he's asking them to support the church in Jerusalem.
[time=2426] And he's asking them in the midst of their affliction, in the midst of all that persecution that's going on, he asks them to give to the Jerusalem church.
[time=2436] And here's what he says in 2 Corinthians 8 and 9.
[time=2440] He says, "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, he
[time=2447] became poor for your sake, that you who are poor might become rich in him."
[time=2454] Now that's not speaking about some bank account in heaven.
[time=2460] That's speaking about the fact that Christ who had everything in heaven, that he humbled
[time=2466] himself and came down on this earth to die on the cross so that we who are on this earth
[time=2474] might become rich in him.
[time=2478] And now out of that, out of the fact that he gave up all of those riches to die on the
[time=2484] cross, now you give with great liberality.
[time=2491] 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, this is another one that came to remind Romans 12, 1 and 2, it says, "Therefore offer your bodies as living sacrifices," right?
[time=2500] Moral thing to do, to live your life in such a way that you're a servant, you're out there.
[time=2507] In that phrase it says this, it says, "According to the mercies of God, the mercies of God,
[time=2516] the gospel." So the reason that we're supposed to live in that way is because we have experienced
[time=2525] the mercy of God.
[time=2526] So it is the purpose.
[time=2527] It's the motivation.
[time=2528] So in that, there are also times when it's the pattern, the gospel becomes the pattern for us.
[time=2534] Because the gospel occurred, you have an example to follow.
[time=2538] Another one, humility, Philippians 2, 1 through 8.
[time=2542] Paul says, "Have this attitude in yourself," which was also in Christ Jesus.
[time=2545] And it goes on to say that although he existed in the form of God, did not consider equality with God, a thing to be grasped, but he emptied himself, right?
[time=2555] This idea that he himself became humble to die on the cross.
[time=2560] So we, looking at his pattern, need to be humble people, need to exercise humility on
[time=2568] a daily basis.
[time=2569] Ephesians 5.25, "Husbands, love your wives, how?
[time=2575] As Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her."
[time=2581] That's gospel language, people, that is the gospel, that he gave himself up for us.
[time=2587] And because he gave himself up for us, now we as husbands should give ourselves up for
[time=2593] our wives.
[time=2594] Do you see the connection?
[time=2598] I could stand up here and say to myself and say to you husbands, every day I could stand up here, "Go love your wives." And stop at that.
[time=2606] Go love your wives.
[time=2609] And it would be a good message and it would be a true message.
[time=2613] But more practical than that could be go love your wives and remember that God in Christ
[time=2619] has loved you first in that same way.
[time=2623] Now out of that, go love your wives.
[time=2628] The gospel is the link to our behavior, to motivate our behavior, to fuel our behavior
[time=2635] in a spirit-filled way.
[time=2636] Ephesians 4, 32, be kind to one another, tenderhearted, caring for one another, forgiving
[time=2642] one another just as God in Christ Jesus has forgiven you.
[time=2651] How do you find the motivation to forgive sometimes?
[time=2655] People, me included, we're mean.
[time=2659] Sometimes it's really hard to forgive, isn't it?
[time=2664] It's never more easy to forgive than when we're experiencing the forgiveness of Christ on our behalf.
[time=2670] It's exactly what Ephesians 4, 32 is talking about.
[time=2674] Ultimately, in Scripture, God links Christian behavior to the gospel and therefore it should
[time=2681] flow out of the gospel, otherwise these acts of obedience will be done in our own strength,
[time=2689] be difficult to carry out.
[time=2692] It'll happen for a while and then fall to the wayside.
[time=2698] Milton Vincent in the gospel primer said this, "I have come back to a focus on the gospel and found its sufficiency for daily living to be truly overwhelming.
[time=2708] I have found nothing more powerful and life-transforming than the gospel."
[time=2714] That phrase, powerful and life-transforming, we could put practical in there, couldn't we?
[time=2719] "I have found nothing more practical than the gospel." And then he says this, I love this phrase, he says, "Doing right is not always easy,
[time=2730] but it is never more easy than when one is breathing deeply the atmosphere of the gospel."
[time=2739] You see, to Paul, there is nothing more important, there is nothing more practical than the gospel.
[time=2747] I would say that we need to become experts at the gospel.
[time=2754] Couple resources that may help, I've mentioned it before, but there's a little book, it's not very large, it's got short little chapters that help us, it's called The Gospel Primer.
[time=2764] It's by a pastor named Milton Vincent, it is a very helpful tool to keep the gospel
[time=2772] on the forefront of our minds on a daily basis.
[time=2774] The other book that I would suggest is called The Cross-Centered Life, it's by a gentleman named C.J. Mahaney.
[time=2781] But as I think about just application as we finish, really, there's really nothing to do, it's really nothing to do except simply remember Jesus Christ.
[time=2795] That same thing that Paul said to Timothy so many years ago is the advice that we need
[time=2802] still today, remember Jesus Christ, and why is that so important?
[time=2807] Because you and I are tempted to have the gospel simply be something that happened at our justification and leave it there.
[time=2815] So remember Jesus Christ.
[time=2820] Preach the gospel to yourself on a daily basis and dare to reckon it true in everything
[time=2828] that you do, isn't this what communion is all about?
[time=2835] I think one of the reasons that God has instituted communion is that He knew our forgetfulness,
[time=2842] that we would forget.
[time=2844] So on a regular basis, we come back to savor Jesus Christ once again to remember what He's
[time=2852] accomplished.
[time=2853] You know, there is no one, there is no one that loves you more or better than Jesus.
[time=2860] There is no event that means more to you, that will ever mean more to you than Calvary.
[time=2869] So as we move to communion, I'm going to ask Corbin to come on up, certainly communion
[time=2876] is a time to examine yourself and where God by His Spirit brings conviction into your
[time=2883] heart, take it to Calvary, right?
[time=2888] Receive the forgiveness that God offers in His Son Christ.
[time=2892] So it certainly is a time to examine yourself, but it's also a time.
[time=2897] It is also a time to glory in Christ.
[time=2901] It is also a time to delight in your Savior, it's a time to glory in what He has accomplished
[time=2908] for you.
[time=2909] It's a time to leave condemnation and guilt at the cross.
[time=2913] It's a time to leave legalism behind and say, "God, this is not about me and my efforts, but it's solely dependent upon your efforts and your merits for me."
[time=2924] So as we begin thinking about the person and work of Christ, examine yourself and having
[time=2934] done that, move on to rejoicing in all that Christ has accomplished for you, the one that
[time=2942] loves you more than anyone else ever will or ever could, rejoicing in Calvary, the event
[time=2949] that changed everything for you as you believe in it, from now to eternity.
[time=2956] How deep the fathers love for us, how fast beyond all measure, that He would give His
[time=2976] only Son to make a wretch, His treasure.
[time=2989] How great the pain of searing laws, the father turns his face away as wounds which
[time=3005] mark the chosen hope, bring many sons to glory.
[time=3020] Behold the man upon the cross, I see upon his shoulders, I've shamed, I hear my mocking
[time=3046] voice, call out among the scoffers, it was my sin that held him thin until it was accomplished.
[time=3072] His dying breath has brought me life, I know that it is finished.
[time=3090] I will not boast in anything, no gifts, no power, no wisdom, but I will boast in Jesus
[time=3113] Christ, His death and resurrection.
[time=3122] Why should I gain from His reward?
[time=3128] I cannot give an answer, but this I know with all my heart.
[time=3141] His wounds have paid my grandson.
[time=3150] Why should I gain from His reward?
[time=3157] I cannot give an answer, but this I know with all my heart.
[time=3171] His wounds have paid my grandson.
[time=3201] I cannot give an answer, but this I know with all my heart.
[time=3217] I can't give an answer, but this I know with all my heart, I can't give an answer, but
[time=3236] I cannot give an answer, but this I know with all my heart.
[time=3246] I cannot give an answer, but this I know with all my heart, I can't give an answer, but
[time=3269] but this I know with all my heart, I can't give an answer, but this I know with all my
[time=3287] heart, I can't give an answer, but this I know with all my heart, I can't give an answer,
