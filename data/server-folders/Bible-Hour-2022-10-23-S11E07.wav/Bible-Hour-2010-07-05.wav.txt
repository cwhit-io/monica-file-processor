[time=30] [MUSIC - 33 seconds]
[time=70] (audience applauds)
[time=78] [MUSIC - 84 seconds]
[time=179] (audience applauds) - Let's remain standing, shall we, and we'll begin worshiping our God for the freedom and liberty found in him.
[time=192] [MUSIC - 187 seconds]
[time=383] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 327 seconds]
[time=713] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=720] [MUSIC - 371 seconds]
[time=1092] Don't you think these guys one more time for leading us in worship this morning?
[time=1097] [MUSIC - 2 seconds] With the clear and powerful theme of freedom, I don't think I need to stand here and remind any of you in the room this morning of what the opposite of freedom is.
[time=1112] It's to live in bondage.
[time=1116] It is to live in chains.
[time=1119] It is to live without hope.
[time=1123] The opposite of freedom is to be suppressed and under control
[time=1129] and to be without the joy of choosing and loving and walking and we are a free people.
[time=1137] Again, on a number of fronts in this morning, what a great privilege to get to sing about it and worship our God.
[time=1143] All right.
[time=1144] You ever know anybody who even though well-intending too often times just can't shut up?
[time=1152] You ever know anybody who just time and time again just kind of says too much?
[time=1157] You ever know anybody who they get the biggest heart in the world?
[time=1160] Their motives are great, but they just kind of tend to run at the mouth a little too much.
[time=1165] Raise your hand if you know somebody like that.
[time=1167] All right.
[time=1168] You know somebody who in their zeal and their passion, they kind of just too many times, you've seen it in their lives, they just get kind of out ahead of themselves and not only do they get out ahead of themselves, but they get out ahead of everybody else.
[time=1182] They're the kind of person who likes to ask for forgiveness instead of permission.
[time=1187] You know the kind of person I mean?
[time=1189] They just are full of excitement.
[time=1191] They're full of zeal for that which they are committed to.
[time=1194] And yet sometimes that zeal and that commitment just lands them in trouble.
[time=1200] If you know anybody like that or if maybe possibly you are like that, then you have a lot in common with the character that we come to today in our ongoing series, Real Stories, Real Life.
[time=1212] Today, this morning, lessons learned from the life of anybody want to take a guess?
[time=1218] Peter, Peter, the disciple Peter, the one who lived his life,
[time=1226] especially those years with Jesus so close to the Lord, Peter, an amazing character, some things to learn today from his life, some lessons that Peter learned that I think you and I can most definitely benefit from as we look just briefly at some of the things that he experienced.
[time=1244] Just by way of introduction, there are some things I want to just note.
[time=1248] You might want to write these things down.
[time=1250] I already mentioned the first one.
[time=1252] That is that Peter was, as you study the text, as you look through the Gospels, you see that he was extremely passionate, extremely zealous,
[time=1262] extremely willing to speak and to do and to go and to act.
[time=1268] I read somewhere years ago, Peter described as the disciple with the foot-shaped mouth.
[time=1275] And again, maybe you can identify with that.
[time=1278] Maybe you understand exactly what that commentator was saying, but Peter was nonetheless passionate about the Lord, passionate about Christ's mission, passionate about following him.
[time=1289] He was also strategically chosen, I think as you study the bigger context of Peter in his life, we could spend the whole summer studying Peter.
[time=1298] If we did one thing we would take note of is that Jesus looked at Peter at one point in time and said, "Peter, on you, on this rock, see-fuss, Peter, on this rock, I will build my, what, my church." Peter had a lot of heart, Peter had a lot of character, Peter had a lot of promise.
[time=1316] The Lord saw that in him and wanted Peter to understand that upon that promise and upon that willingness and that desire, the Lord was going to build something that would outlive Peter, that would be forever an eternal, that being his bride, the church.
[time=1332] And I think it's also worth noting, we'll get to it later, I think at the end, but it's just worth noting up front as we again just think of some introductory thoughts about Peter that he was martyred.
[time=1343] We sometimes lose sight of this, we sometimes don't think a lot about this, but the fact of the matter is that Peter, along with Paul and the rest of those who walked with the Lord closely, many of them were killed for their faith, their lives were taken because of their testimony, their commitment to Christ,
[time=1364] their belief in what he had called them to and their willingness to identify with it completely and absolutely and genuinely cost them their lives.
[time=1377] It would appear as if from the history books that early in AD 61, 62, 63,
[time=1384] somewhere in their Nero who was now ruling Rome and absolutely and utterly hated Christians.
[time=1391] It was Nero who had them slaughtered in the Colosseum.
[time=1394] It was Nero who had them tarred and lit on fire to give light and heat to his garden parties.
[time=1401] It was Nero who murdered Peter.
[time=1405] It was Nero who had had enough of his effectiveness and his faithfulness.
[time=1411] Legend says, although we don't see it specifically in Scripture, but in the history books, legend has it that he was given the option in his crucifixion
[time=1423] and that Peter had requested to be crucified upside down to in no way shape or form,
[time=1430] have the form or the shape of his death and mirror that of his Lord.
[time=1436] He was passionate.
[time=1438] He was strategically chosen.
[time=1440] He was martyred and as we look at his life, my friends, this morning, while we can't get to all of it, there are three lessons I want you to see and three things I want us to think about today, three lessons from Peter's life.
[time=1451] I'll just invite you to follow along and we're going to start out with.
[time=1455] If you've got your Bibles, open them to Matthew 14.
[time=1458] Go back to the beginning of your New Testament to the 14th chapter of Matthew.
[time=1463] Peter was the first in a lot of things.
[time=1465] Again, that was his personality.
[time=1467] Peter was the first out of the boat.
[time=1470] You can write that down as we begin this morning.
[time=1472] Peter was the first out of the boat.
[time=1475] As I say that, I know for many of you, your minds go immediately to the story of Peter that some of us have heard for years and years, for others of you this morning.
[time=1484] It may be the first time, and whether it's your first time or your hundredth time, we get to see again some things in Peter's mind and some things in Peter's heart
[time=1494] that I believe we can learn from, that we can be encouraged by.
[time=1498] He was the first one out of the boat.
[time=1500] I pick it up in Matthew 14, 22.
[time=1502] Just to set the context for you, Jesus has just fed the how many.
[time=1508] He has just gotten done feeding the 5,000.
[time=1512] The boy came with his loaves and his fish, and the disciples are worried about all these people,
[time=1518] and they're not being enough food, and Jesus has just powerfully and miraculously fed
[time=1524] the entire valley full of people.
[time=1528] Over 5,000 have been fed.
[time=1530] That's coming to its conclusion.
[time=1533] Verse 22 picks it up immediately.
[time=1536] Jesus makes the disciples.
[time=1538] He made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side
[time=1544] while he sent the crowds away.
[time=1546] After he had sent the crowds away, he went up.
[time=1549] Jesus did on the mountain.
[time=1550] We see him doing this again and again and again throughout the gospel's personal, prayerful abiding with the Father.
[time=1558] After he had sent the crowds away, he, Jesus, went up on the mountain by himself to pray.
[time=1564] And when it was evening, he was there alone.
[time=1568] He was there on the mountain alone, but 24, but the boat was already a long distance
[time=1574] from the land, battered by the waves.
[time=1577] The storm had moved in.
[time=1579] The seas were treacherous.
[time=1581] For the wind was contrary is what my translation says.
[time=1586] It's an interesting word for really, really high and really, really destructive.
[time=1591] And in the fourth watch of the night, middle of the night, fourth watch of the night,
[time=1597] about 3, 4, 5 a.m., he came to them walking on the sea.
[time=1606] When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were what?
[time=1611] Say it.
[time=1612] Terrified.
[time=1613] They were terrified and they said, "It's a ghost!" And they cried out in fear, but immediately Jesus spoke to them saying, "Take courage.
[time=1624] Take courage.
[time=1625] Hang on, guys.
[time=1627] Come down its eye.
[time=1628] Do not be afraid." And Peter said, verse 28, "Peter said to him, 'Peter said, 'Lord, if it's you,
[time=1638] command me to come to you on the water.'" Then he said, "Come." And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
[time=1651] Great, great story.
[time=1654] Great, great depiction of what went on that night on those waters.
[time=1657] You've got to love Peter.
[time=1660] At least I do.
[time=1661] I mean, look at the text.
[time=1663] It says they were reeling from the storm and says they're terrified of the ghost they
[time=1669] thought they saw walking on the water in the night and then they realized, you've got to picture this boat full of the disciples and they realized it's not a ghost walking on the water, it's Jesus.
[time=1680] And you've got to just picture in your mind the relief they must have felt that you can hear the collective sigh of, "Oh, my goodness.
[time=1690] Lord, thank you." And the waves start to settle and they're like, "Oh, my goodness.
[time=1696] Oh, Lord, it's good to see you." And they're all talking to each other and they're all just kind of realizing the same thing at the same time and that is that they're safe.
[time=1705] There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.
[time=1708] Oh, Lord, please just get us over to the shore.
[time=1712] They're thinking and they're saying to themselves, "Oh, we're going to make it back safely."
[time=1719] These guys, they do every once in a while.
[time=1722] They do frustrate me.
[time=1724] And I got to be careful because if I were in their shoes, maybe it would have been different.
[time=1728] But sometimes you read these accounts and you think, "My goodness." He just fed 5,000 people with a couple of sardines and some breadsticks.
[time=1739] And you're out there in the boat and you see him and you're like, "You're thinking he's a ghost.
[time=1743] You're afraid?" But they were and he calms them down and they're going to be okay and they want to get back to safety, but then there's Peter.
[time=1754] Then there's Peter.
[time=1755] You've got to love Peter who really listened, who really loved, and they all did, I believe, but he really loved Jesus.
[time=1765] And he really wanted to be like Jesus.
[time=1769] Remember Peter, young boy his whole life in that context, in that day those young boys
[time=1776] only wanted to be one thing, and that was a rabbi.
[time=1780] They just wanted to follow a rabbi.
[time=1782] They wanted to be connected to a rabbi.
[time=1784] They wanted to be sharp enough and they wanted to be bright enough and they wanted to be advanced enough to be able to be the follower of a significant rabbi in the synagogue.
[time=1795] And remember Peter wasn't.
[time=1799] Remember when Jesus found him, he wasn't in the synagogue with a popular rabbi.
[time=1804] He was fishing, which means he hadn't made the cut, which means he hadn't been smart enough,
[time=1811] which means he hadn't advanced down the road that every boy wanted to advance.
[time=1819] But then Jesus came and said, "What?
[time=1822] Drop your nets and follow me." And it changed his life.
[time=1829] And all he wanted to do was be like him.
[time=1833] So all he wanted to do was follow Jesus.
[time=1836] He wanted to be a disciple.
[time=1838] And we've taught you along the way here that disciples did what Jesus did.
[time=1845] And our friend Peter took it very, very seriously.
[time=1849] He was passionate about his following.
[time=1853] So he says, "Jesus, I'm kind of paraphrasing here.
[time=1857] Jesus, I want to try the water-walking thing." Jesus, I mean the storms just come down.
[time=1865] You know, guys are scurrying around for towels and safety.
[time=1869] And he wants to get out of the boat and do what Jesus did.
[time=1873] He wants to walk on the water.
[time=1876] He's not interested in towels.
[time=1878] He's not interested in safety.
[time=1880] He wants, listen, he wants to take a chance.
[time=1885] He wants to take a chance.
[time=1887] He wants to be bold.
[time=1890] The miraculous was so inviting to Peter.
[time=1895] When you study Peter, you come to realize that he wasn't afraid of it for the most part.
[time=1900] He embraced it.
[time=1902] He couldn't stand the thought.
[time=1904] Peter being Peter, Peter being wired the way Peter was wired.
[time=1907] Peter being the kind of guy that he was in the disciple that the Lord was growing him into.
[time=1913] Peter couldn't stand the thought of staying in the, what, boat.
[time=1920] Why is that?
[time=1926] Follow me here.
[time=1928] You see, the way Peter saw it, I believe, is what if when Jesus said to him on the beach that day when the Lord called him into his service?
[time=1941] See, the way I see it, the way Peter thinks about it is what if when Jesus said to him on the beach that day, "Peter, come follow me?"
[time=1956] I think the way Peter thought about it was this, what if he really meant it?
[time=1963] I think that's the way he viewed it.
[time=1965] What if when Jesus called him to drop his net and leave his family and leave his friends and leave everything he knew?
[time=1973] And when Jesus said to him, "Peter, come follow me.
[time=1976] Come go where I go.
[time=1978] Come do what I do." I think in Peter's mind, he always lived with the notion that Jesus really, really meant it.
[time=1989] Do you remember?
[time=1991] Just curious.
[time=1993] Do you remember the day that Jesus called you?
[time=1998] Do you?
[time=2000] Do you remember the day that Jesus said, " Todd, come follow me."
[time=2008] Stan, do you remember the day when Jesus said, "Come and follow me." Do you remember that, Stacey?
[time=2015] I do.
[time=2017] Do you remember that, Church, Gary, Alice, you remember when Jesus said, "Come follow me."
[time=2024] Lance, you remember that?
[time=2026] Do you remember that, Howard?
[time=2028] Do you remember, Joe, when Jesus said, "Come and do what I do.
[time=2031] Come and live like I live.
[time=2032] Come and value what I value." Do you remember that, John?
[time=2040] I think my question for all of you today is this.
[time=2044] What if he really meant it?
[time=2050] What if, like Peter, you would view his call to you to follow after him with the same kind
[time=2056] of deliberate passion and devotion and seriousness that he did?
[time=2063] And what if today that will require you, whoever you are, I couldn't get to all of you?
[time=2069] But what if he meant it and what if today that will require you to attempt the unthinkable?
[time=2078] What if it's going to require you to get out of your boat and try the impossible, give
[time=2084] yourself to the scary, offer yourself to the unpredictable?
[time=2089] What if his call on your life to follow him is like the call he put on Peter's life?
[time=2096] Are you ready to place your trust and faith in a God that really does give you opportunities
[time=2103] to defy reason, to go against the odds and risk it all for the kingdom?
[time=2117] Maybe you're living together and you shouldn't be and maybe in your heart you know it's time
[time=2123] to do something about it and you want to follow Jesus but you know it will be financially
[time=2129] difficult, you know friends will say things, you know it will look kind of weird because you already started but maybe it's time to get out of that boat and follow him.
[time=2141] Maybe it's time to change jobs, maybe it's time to take that job that every one of your
[time=2147] friends will look at you and say what are you thinking?
[time=2151] As you know in taking that job you'll be given opportunities to do things none of them realize.
[time=2155] You know there's something going on with that opportunity that God has for you, maybe you should just buck the odds and do it.
[time=2166] Maybe you need to shoot a text or an email or phone call to a friend this week and ask
[time=2173] them to just get together and have coffee because you just know in your heart you need to say something.
[time=2179] You know you should say something, you've known you should say something for months and you haven't but you know what's transpired, you know what's been done, you know what's been said isn't what God designed and you want to do your best to lovingly, carefully, thoughtfully
[time=2196] speak the truth to him or her in love and ask them to consider doing what's right.
[time=2203] Maybe you should give more even though your accountant looks at you like your nuts, maybe
[time=2209] you should downsize to free up resources to help those who have genuine, serious life-threatening
[time=2218] needs.
[time=2219] I want to make sure you see the end of the slide there.
[time=2222] He was the first out of the boat so remember this morning my friends, follow Christ with a bold willingness to risk.
[time=2230] Follow Christ my friends, young ones in the room, older ones in the room, follow him and
[time=2236] follow him with a bold willingness to risk, comfort, safety, the opinions of others in
[time=2243] an effort to do what he's called you to do.
[time=2246] Secondly, he was not only the first out of the boat, he was the first out of the game.
[time=2251] What an amazing shift we see here from the highest of highs to probably one of the lowest
[time=2257] of lows, Peter, that's right, was the first out of the game.
[time=2261] What do we mean by out of the game?
[time=2262] Well, turn to Matthew 26, if you will.
[time=2266] As you come to Matthew 26, we pick it up, the scene in the garden of Gethsemane has transpired.
[time=2273] Jesus has asked the Father for this cup to pass from him.
[time=2277] That's not the will of the Father.
[time=2278] The will of the Father is that Jesus will be sacrificed for the sins and the redemption of mankind.
[time=2284] And so the Romans have come, they've seized Jesus with Judas there in the garden, they've
[time=2290] taken him into town, they're going to throw together some poor excuse of a trial.
[time=2296] He's going to be convicted, he's going to be beaten, he's going to be slain.
[time=2302] This is all transpiring as we come to Matthew 26, 69, verse 26th chapter.
[time=2313] And while all this is happening, everything's going south quick.
[time=2317] Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, outside of where all the legal proceedings
[time=2323] were taking place, and a servant girl came to him and said, "You, you two were with
[time=2329] Jesus the Galilean, but he denied it.
[time=2334] He denied it before them saying, 'I do not know what you are talking about.
[time=2339] Watch the progression here, my friends.
[time=2340] I don't know what you're talking about.' When he'd gone out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to those who
[time=2349] were near, 'This man, this man was with Jesus of Nazareth, and again, he denied it with an oath.' He says, 'The first time I don't know what you're talking about, the second time he denies it with an oath, and as since I swear to God, I don't know who he was.
[time=2367] Now you sense the energy, and now you sense the denial, and now you sense all that's going on.' And Peter coming even closer to the surface.
[time=2376] He denied it with an oath.
[time=2378] I do not know the man, and a little later, 73, a little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, 'Surely you two are one of them, for even the way you talk gives you
[time=2389] away, interesting little side note there, even the way you talk.'
[time=2398] You know when you're really, really close to somebody, when you spend an inordinate amount
[time=2406] of time with somebody, when you have a lot of respect for somebody, when you live life
[time=2413] with someone, it's interesting how we'll start to sound like them, isn't it?
[time=2420] For you even sound like him, they said, was undeniable how close he had been, was undeniable
[time=2430] how much he had experienced, even the way you talk gives you away.
[time=2435] Then he began to curse and swear, 'I do not know the man.'
[time=2441] We go from, 'I don't know the man to, I swear to God, I don't know the man to beep, beep, beep, beep, I don't know the man.' And we can laugh at that.
[time=2451] There's a little humor there, but listen, this is interesting, because we all heard the
[time=2457] same, many of us heard the same Sunday school stories, and we all saw the passion of the
[time=2463] Christ, and I've just heard it and watched it and seen it kind of be assumed for years and years.
[time=2469] You may stay with this option, I'll give you a little test here, a little quiz, a little chance to voice your opinion.
[time=2474] What do you think was going on in him?
[time=2481] What do you think was the dominant emotion that Peter's feeling as all this is coming
[time=2491] down?
[time=2493] What do you think the dominant, again, I know how he's been portrayed, I'm just curious.
[time=2498] Are you there with that?
[time=2499] I mean, we all kind of just know where I'm going here.
[time=2503] He's always been portrayed as being what, afraid, fearful, hovering over in the corner
[time=2513] and not wanting to be seen, but he's yelling, I don't know him, he's swearing to God and
[time=2522] he's cussing that he doesn't know him.
[time=2526] And I know it might be semantics, but I just offer it to you as a thought.
[time=2530] I think he's, I think he may have been afraid.
[time=2533] I think the dominant feeling in Peter was he's mad, and it goes to reason when you think
[time=2540] about his character, you go to reason when you get to know Peter, he had given everything.
[time=2547] He had put it all on the line.
[time=2549] All chips were in the middle of the table.
[time=2553] He was absolutely convinced that Jesus was the Messiah.
[time=2557] He was sure that Rome was coming down.
[time=2561] He knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that Messiah had come that all wrongs would be righted, that the throne was about to be taken.
[time=2570] Boy, those soldiers come in the garden and he's like, absolutely, he's pulling out his
[time=2576] sword and he's whacking off ears.
[time=2580] But Jesus says, whoa, it's not how we're going to do this.
[time=2586] What?
[time=2590] Fear, maybe.
[time=2596] I think he's just disillusioned and angry, fed up.
[time=2601] I think he feels like maybe he got sold a bill of goods.
[time=2605] He wants out.
[time=2606] You ever been there?
[time=2612] Think about it.
[time=2614] Lesson number two for you this morning, you ever been there?
[time=2618] You say, where's there?
[time=2621] Completely and thoroughly convinced that God was going to do this, absolutely sure that
[time=2632] God would never ever allow that.
[time=2640] You ever been just thoroughly in your own heart and mind, convinced of the fact that you were in what you were thinking and the direction you were choosing.
[time=2649] You were smack, dab in the middle of God's will.
[time=2657] And then you realize through a series of events or circumstances that you're not.
[time=2666] And what you knew in your heart, he wouldn't do, he does.
[time=2671] And what you knew in your soul, he'd never allow, he allows.
[time=2679] You ever been there?
[time=2681] Come on, we're a family.
[time=2683] Raise your hand if you've been there.
[time=2685] Raise your hand if you've experienced those feelings.
[time=2690] I've been there too.
[time=2691] I've been there with you.
[time=2692] And in those places we are to be reminded, this just came to me a few minutes ago, Deuteronomy
[time=2700] 32, Deuteronomy 32, 3, and 4.
[time=2706] For I proclaim the name of the Lord, ascribe greatness to our God, the rock.
[time=2712] His work is perfect for all his ways are just, a God of faithfulness.
[time=2720] And without injustice, righteous and upright is he, amen, amen.
[time=2730] And we can say amen to that.
[time=2732] He is without injustice.
[time=2734] His ways are true.
[time=2736] They are right.
[time=2736] They are good all together.
[time=2741] So what he allows and to what he does is exactly what we believed in our hearts, he wouldn't.
[time=2749] Be careful.
[time=2750] Look at the screen.
[time=2752] He was the first one out of the game.
[time=2753] And as a reminder for you and I, be careful whose plans you are devoted to, right?
[time=2760] Gods or yours?
[time=2764] You see, over time, the commitment to follow Christ can get a little fuzzy if we're not careful.
[time=2770] If we follow Him for a while, then begin to think we know the route.
[time=2775] And then all of a sudden, the job is gone.
[time=2779] And all of a sudden, the baby gets really, really sick.
[time=2783] And all of a sudden, the relationship you thought was going to just be forever isn't.
[time=2791] You're 45, 50, 55 years old looking at your life going, wow, how did I get here?
[time=2796] This isn't at all what I imagined it would be.
[time=2801] You get sick.
[time=2802] You get injured.
[time=2804] All kinds of things lead you and me to a place of having to daily, listen, here's the encouragement
[time=2811] for you and I, to get on your knees morning, noon and night, to take your white knuckle grip that you've got on this picture that you think just has to come true and let it go and say, God, you know what?
[time=2823] You're good and right and true, your ways are just and I will follow you.
[time=2831] And I've watched many of you in the room this morning do that and you've been an encouragement to me for years as I've watched you do that.
[time=2842] I love how the story of Peter's denial ends up.
[time=2845] Christ gets crucified, he's raised from the dead, he graciously shows himself again to
[time=2853] Peter and the rest of the disciples.
[time=2858] And I love just because we're talking about Peter, I've just got to mention this.
[time=2861] You can jot this down, John 21.
[time=2863] We won't turn there, but John 21 just gives you some great insight in the Peter.
[time=2868] You remember the scene, I mean, it's coming to the end of the story.
[time=2873] It's before Christ ascends, but there's this one last scene, it's so classic, Peter.
[time=2879] Remember the guys, they're just so distraught, they just say, let's go fish.
[time=2882] And they just, they go out fishing and they fish all night and catch what?
[time=2887] Nothing.
[time=2888] Absolutely nothing.
[time=2889] They're making their way back in.
[time=2890] It's in the morning light and Jesus is on the shore.
[time=2893] Do you remember this?
[time=2894] Nod your head.
[time=2895] He's on the shore, they're so far out, a hundred or so yards, they can't even see it's him and he's yelling, hey, how'd it go?
[time=2901] I know, not so good, throw your nets on the other side, they throw their nets on the other side more fish than they can't even handle.
[time=2909] The boat starts to sink, they're trying to pull this stuff up.
[time=2912] It's like amazing.
[time=2914] And in that moment, they realize who it is.
[time=2917] Remember?
[time=2918] And it says there in John 21 that when they remembered who it was, it's classic Peter.
[time=2924] It says in the text that he put his tunic back on, because he had taken his tunic off,
[time=2930] it was very important to the text.
[time=2932] The tunic had been taken off because he was working.
[time=2934] You only had your tunic on when it was time to travel.
[time=2940] You put your tunic on when it was time to go.
[time=2943] And he realizes it's Jesus, he's 150 yards out in the water.
[time=2949] And it says he grabs his tunic, puts it on, and dives in the water.
[time=2955] John and Andrew are going, "Dude, we'll row back, thank you."
[time=2961] And Peter's just swimming like a mad man, because he's just got to get to Jesus and his tunics on, because it's time to go.
[time=2971] Just loved him so much, just wanted to be with him so badly, can't even wait to row in.
[time=2976] He's just diving in the water.
[time=2979] So thankful for another chance.
[time=2982] See in the room this morning, thankful for another chance.
[time=2987] John 21, you should read it.
[time=2991] First one, "Out of the boat," my friends.
[time=2993] First one, "Out of the game," thirdly, first one, "Back out of the gate."
[time=2999] Again, second chance, Acts chapter two, "Wow, what a picture." This is real quick.
[time=3004] Turn there.
[time=3005] If you would, Acts chapter two, "The crucifixion has taken place." Christ has defeated death, he has appeared to the disciples, he's ascended into heaven before he ascends, he tells them, "Hang on, don't freak out, just stay together.
[time=3023] I'm going to send you a, what, helper, spirit of God is going to come."
[time=3029] So here's Peter, here's John, here's the 120-ish or so, they're just in this upper room there
[time=3036] and Acts two, Jerusalem is absolutely crawling with people back for the festivities, pass
[time=3043] over and all of a sudden, boom, the Spirit comes.
[time=3047] And the Spirit empowers them.
[time=3052] And they're able to communicate, it says in languages, of all the people who were in Jerusalem.
[time=3060] They're given by the Holy Spirit, tongues that allow them to communicate.
[time=3065] The gospel in unknown languages to them, people begin to be reached with the gospel.
[time=3073] And this enormous crowd gathers.
[time=3076] And my mind can't help but go back to Peter at night that they arrested Jesus, he's just
[time=3083] trying his best to get away from people.
[time=3087] And now with thousands and thousands of people filling the city and the Spirit of God has
[time=3093] come.
[time=3094] There's an Acts two, 14, I just love it.
[time=3097] But Peter, taking his stand with the 11, raised his voice and declared to them men of Judea
[time=3106] and to all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give heed to my words.
[time=3116] And you've got to go home today and just read 15 and on.
[time=3121] With great strength and with great courage and with great boldness.
[time=3126] Listen, he speaks.
[time=3131] He says what needed to be said.
[time=3135] And I wanted just to encourage you this morning.
[time=3139] He was the first one, after a little time out, he was the first one out of the gate.
[time=3144] And there may be some of you here this morning and in your world, in your situation, in your
[time=3150] family, in your workplace, on your block, wherever it is God has you.
[time=3156] You may need to learn from this third lesson that we see in Peter's life.
[time=3160] You may need to speak up.
[time=3163] Maybe time for you to say something, preferably the gospel, maybe in some way God's giving
[time=3169] you the chance to articulate to those who really do need to hear it.
[time=3173] And maybe from you they'll hear it, the truth about them and their sin and a loving God
[time=3180] who provides for them a sacrifice and a life with meaning today and a life for eternity
[time=3188] tomorrow.
[time=3190] Peter speaks up.
[time=3192] Peter says what needed to be said, 3,000, 3,000 people come to faith that day because
[time=3202] of his willingness to speak.
[time=3204] Peter helps birth the church.
[time=3206] Peter helps lead the church.
[time=3209] Peter helps the church suffer with boldness and dignity and courage.
[time=3215] He dies a martyr's death, like I said, in Rome under Nero.
[time=3219] And I want to read this to you as we close.
[time=3221] Turn in your Bibles if you've got them, please everybody.
[time=3223] Turn back to 1 Peter.
[time=3224] I'm pretty sure most of you realize who wrote 1st and 2nd Peter.
[time=3233] Peter writes it and it's just amazing for me.
[time=3236] Every chance I get, we learn about Peter and the gospels.
[time=3240] You read about Peter's character and Peter's relationship with Jesus and all these things that he did and the stuff that makes us laugh, you get this incredible picture of Peter kind of early on.
[time=3251] When he grows up, then he comes to Acts 2, then on he goes and God grows him and God
[time=3257] seasons him.
[time=3258] And he writes 1 Peter and it's amazing sometimes to look back at the Peter and the gospels who travels with Jesus, the guy with the foot-shaped mouth, and then to read some of the things he wrote.
[time=3269] Let me leave you with this.
[time=3270] 1 Peter 5, 1 Peter 5, 6, and 11.
[time=3274] This is our Peter.
[time=3275] This is the guy we've been talking about today.
[time=3278] Listen to the wisdom, listen to the clarity.
[time=3282] He says to the church, he says to you and I this morning, my friends, therefore humble yourselves.
[time=3287] Under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety
[time=3294] on him because he cares for you.
[time=3296] Be of sober spirit, Peter telling you and I to be of sober spirit.
[time=3302] Be clear.
[time=3303] Be careful.
[time=3305] Peter telling us, be of sober spirit.
[time=3309] Be on the alert.
[time=3311] Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion.
[time=3314] He knew that.
[time=3316] He had experienced that, that night by the fire, seeking someone to devour but resist
[time=3323] him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished
[time=3329] by your brethren who are in the world.
[time=3332] And after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ will himself perfect, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.
[time=3346] He will to him be dominion forever and ever, amen.
[time=3351] And Nero had had enough and he nailed him to a cross and he killed him.
[time=3358] And what an amazing reunion that must have been between Peter and our Lord, amen, amen.
[time=3366] Hey, give it some thought.
[time=3368] It may be time for you to hop out of that nice cozy boat of yours and give yourself to something
[time=3376] a little risky.
[time=3379] Give it some thought, my friends.
[time=3382] Be careful.
[time=3386] Be careful with your plans.
[time=3389] They may not be his.
[time=3392] Hold them loosely and speak up.
[time=3397] Say something, articulate the hope that is within you.
[time=3402] Do your very best with his help to lovingly say what needs to be said to those who desperately need to hear it.
[time=3408] Would you stand and let me pray for you this morning.
[time=3412] So we're thankful for the message today that we hear not from me but God from your word
[time=3418] and from the life of Peter.
[time=3421] May our boldness and our zeal God be tempered by your wisdom.
[time=3426] May our plans over time become more and more yours and less and less ours.
[time=3433] And oh God, would you give us the courage and the grace to speak the truth, to share and live out the gospel in ways that could make a difference, God allow us please the opportunity
[time=3444] to learn from these things that we've seen this morning.
[time=3447] Well thank you for it.
[time=3449] And if it be your will, bring us back together again soon so that we can enjoy and be encouraged
[time=3456] by the fellowship that you've given us here in this family.
[time=3460] As we go God to different places, as we leave today to different neighborhoods, God as we
[time=3466] leave this place and give ourselves to different segments of people in different parts of this
[time=3472] community.
[time=3473] Oh God, I pray that you would give us unity, that you would give us great strength of character and heart.
[time=3480] Thank you God for what you've put before us.
[time=3482] Give us the strength to accomplish all that you've called us to and all the people in the room agreed and said amen.
