[time=585] 20 screens going at one time.
[time=587] The music blaring, break.
[time=591] Where's your favorite restaurant in town?
[time=593] Not B-dubs.
[time=594] It's all right.
[time=597] Granite City.
[time=599] Cataballou.
[time=602] All right, last one.
[time=604] Last one, favorite pastor, no, just kidding.
[time=609] Here's the deal.
[time=611] Now we're gonna go to the Bible, and here's the funny thing about the Bible.
[time=614] When you start talking about favorites in the Bible, it's kind of a weird thing 'cause we kind of think, well, we shouldn't have like a favorite story.
[time=621] It's all true, it's all good, it's all useful.
[time=624] You wouldn't wanna single one out.
[time=626] Listen, it is all true, and it is all good.
[time=630] But I've got my, after years and years of studying this thing, I've got my favorites.
[time=634] How about you?
[time=635] There are just some stories in this book that are true, we all know that.
[time=640] And as you've read them, and as you've studied them, and maybe you had them told to you as a kid, and it just somehow for some reason stuck with you, this guy, or this gal, or this individual recorded for us, and the pages of this amazing book, they're just our favorites.
[time=657] And I've got a few, but I gotta tell you this morning, I have been looking forward to this moment, all week long, because this morning we come in our series of real stories, and real life, and the lessons that we can learn from the lives of these people, we come to one of my all-time favorites, and that is the life and the story of Joseph.
[time=677] What an amazing story.
[time=683] What an incredible lesson, lessons for us to learn as we look into the life of this young man, and all that God did, and all that Joseph saw, and all that he endured, and all that he experienced.
[time=699] What an incredible privilege for us this morning to come to the life of Joseph.
[time=704] I wanna encourage you, if you would, to open your Bibles to Genesis 37.
[time=709] Three segments in the message this morning kind of divided his life.
[time=713] We could spend, again, a summer on Joseph this morning, just a few minutes, but three segments.
[time=718] We'll look at the boy, Joseph.
[time=720] We'll look at the servant, Joseph, and we'll look at the king.
[time=725] Literally the ruler, king, Joseph, and in those three segments of his life, I want you to see a lesson I think that we can pull from each of these time frames in his life.
[time=736] Go to Genesis 37.
[time=738] When you get to Genesis 37, we're gonna pick it up right there in verse one.
[time=743] Here we come under the section called the boy, and our subtitle, and what I want you to think about it as we read is be careful, my friends.
[time=753] Be careful with what?
[time=754] Say it out loud.
[time=756] Jealousy.
[time=757] Be careful kids with jealousy.
[time=760] Be careful moms and dads with jealousy.
[time=763] Be careful young people.
[time=765] Be careful grown up people.
[time=767] It's not a good thing.
[time=768] Now Jacob, 37 won.
[time=770] Now Jacob lived in the land where his father had sojourned in the land of Canaan.
[time=776] These are the records of the generations of Jacob.
[time=781] Joseph, when 17 years of age was pastoring the flock with his brothers while he was still a youth, he was younger, they were older.
[time=789] Along with the sons of Billha and the sons of Zilpa, his father's wives.
[time=795] And Joseph brought back a bad report about them to their father.
[time=800] Don't know exactly what was going on here.
[time=803] Don't know if father had asked for a report.
[time=805] Don't know if Joseph was just narking on him.
[time=809] Don't know exactly how it went down, but Joseph comes back and tells dad big brothers were not behaving or playing well with others.
[time=817] Now Israel loved Joseph more than all of his sons
[time=823] because he was the son, Joseph was the son of his Israel's old age.
[time=831] And he made him a very colored tunic.
[time=835] His brothers saw that their father loved him Joseph more than all of them, his brothers.
[time=842] And so they hated him and could not speak to him on friendly terms.
[time=849] A side note.
[time=852] Dad's, moms, be careful.
[time=859] Be careful how you share and spread your love around.
[time=865] Be careful with that.
[time=867] We can talk about just the normal tendencies.
[time=870] I mean anybody in the room have a younger, anybody in the room come from a family of siblings and you and I both know the youngest one got all the attention and love and we joke about it yet.
[time=880] Anybody raise your hand if you understand that experience.
[time=882] Right, okay.
[time=883] So we can joke about that and we can laugh about it.
[time=885] And to a degree it might even be true.
[time=887] But here's the point.
[time=888] Dad's, moms, be careful.
[time=890] To spread and share and distribute and invest your love and your devotion and your affection as lovingly and as equally and as faithfully as you possibly can no matter what their bent is, no matter if they're like her or like him.
[time=913] No matter how that goes, no matter what they like, regardless of whether they follow the dreams and the hopes that you had for them, no matter how it goes, how tumultuous it might get, understand the power of the love and affection of a father and a mother toward a child.
[time=934] Young, grown, doesn't matter.
[time=937] Moms, dads, be careful.
[time=939] They knew he loved Joseph more than he loved them and they hated him and could not speak to him on friendly terms.
[time=948] Then Joseph had a dream and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more.
[time=954] So first they hate him, now they hate him even more.
[time=956] He said to them, please listen to this dream which I have had for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field and lo, my sheave rose up and also stood erect and behold your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheave.
[time=971] And his brothers said to him, are you actually going to reign over us or are you really going to rule over us?
[time=977] So they hated him, what, say it even more.
[time=982] For his dreams and for his words you could insert there I think his youthful words.
[time=988] We see his youthfulness even being rebuke here in a bit but they hated him.
[time=993] Now he had still another dream, verse nine, you with me?
[time=999] And related it to his brothers and said, lo I have had still another dream and behold the sun and the moon and 11 stars were bowing down to me.
[time=1008] He related it to his father and to his brothers and his father rebuked him and said to him, what is this dream that you have had?
[time=1015] Shall I and your mother and your brothers actually come to bow ourselves down before you to the ground?
[time=1022] His brothers were, say it out loud, jealous of him but his father kept the saying in mind.
[time=1030] So we're going to learn something here from his brothers.
[time=1035] The only point in the message where we'll deviate from lessons learned from the life of Joseph.
[time=1039] Here I want you to think about and I'd love for you this morning to think honestly my friends about this.
[time=1045] Chance for you to learn something I think, a chance for me to learn some things as I have already this week from the life and the experience of his brothers.
[time=1056] Here's my question, here are my questions for you this morning, is there someone in your life who seems to get treated better than you?
[time=1065] Is there someone in your life who just seems to get treated better than you?
[time=1072] They have more than you.
[time=1076] They seem to be more liked than you.
[time=1087] And on the popular front, let's just stop there for a minute make sure we all admit the fact that popularity doesn't end at high school, amen?
[time=1096] Mom's and Dad's, you and I like to talk to our kids about popularity and how they should deal with that and how they should handle that and we can chuckle and think about how young they are and how foolish it is.
[time=1113] And yet you and I, Mom's and Dad's, we feel the very same thing.
[time=1118] We wanna be popular.
[time=1123] And there are some who are just more than you are.
[time=1127] There are some who are more than I am.
[time=1129] They seem to be more liked, more popular, more loved, more sought after.
[time=1135] Teachers, coaches, friends, people in general just seem to be more drawn to him, more drawn to her, more drawn to them than they are to you.
[time=1147] Is there someone in your life who's been more successful than you?
[time=1152] Made more money than you and you're close to them so you know they've made more money than you.
[time=1161] Maybe they got better grades than you, scored more points than you.
[time=1167] Maybe their kids ended up at a better college than yours.
[time=1171] Maybe their kids just ended up better, period.
[time=1176] However, you would define better.
[time=1178] If so, I think the scripture gives us an opportunity this morning, my friends, to be very, very careful and to be very, very aware of this thing called jealousy.
[time=1191] Be very careful if you are beginning to feel or have felt for some time this jealous stirring in your heart and your soul.
[time=1200] My friend's jealousy destroys, the Bible is so clear about this, jealousy destroys, jealousy corrupts, jealousy infects.
[time=1212] It affects you, it infects your attitude, it corrupts your motives, it destroys things and situations and circumstances around you.
[time=1226] Lot of definitions, you could write one up this morning, you'd be very accurate, doesn't take Webster to help us figure this out.
[time=1233] But a lot of definitions out there, jealousy, hating, resenting, despising or disliking.
[time=1239] Take your pick, hating, resenting, despising or disliking someone because they have and you don't.
[time=1247] Because they have and you don't, because they've been giving something that you didn't get.
[time=1254] They've won something, they've achieved something they've been seemingly blessed with something they've been given and you haven't.
[time=1264] You didn't win it, you didn't achieve it, you didn't get blessed with it, nobody gave it to you and so you begin to hate, resent, despise or dislike.
[time=1276] Now why do I say be careful?
[time=1280] Well, look what happened.
[time=1282] To jealousy, listen, jealousy unchecked, unconfessed, allowed to run rampant, look what happens in the text, go to Genesis 37, go to verse 18.
[time=1294] Joseph's father has now sent him to check on his brothers, they've been out away from home, tending the family flocks.
[time=1303] Joseph makes his approach verse 18 when they saw him, remember now they hated him, then they hated him even more, then they hated him even more, then when they hated him even more.
[time=1314] Now they're really, really hating him, the jealousy has risen to the top when they saw him, verse 18 from a distance and before he came close to them, they plotted against him to put him to what, to death.
[time=1327] They said to each other, here comes this dreamer, now then come and let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits and we will say a wild beast devoured him, then let us see what will become of his dreams.
[time=1347] They hate him, now they wanna uncheck, unconfessed, jealousy, now they wanna kill him, now they'd rather him just be gone.
[time=1357] It's a deadly thing, jealousy, Job 5-2, you can write this down, Job 5-2, for anger slays the foolish man and jealousy kills the simple, jealousy kills the simple, Proverbs 6-34 and 35, 34 says, "For jealousy enrages a man "and he will not spare in the day of vengeance." Goes on in verse 35 to say, "He will not accept any ransom, "nor will he be satisfied, though you give many gifts." Jealousy blinds us, it creates a rage in us, it creates a pridefulness in us, there begins to be in us from the very seeds of jealousy, something that left unchecked and unconfessed, cannot be satisfied, will not be satisfied, action gets taken, things get done, stuff gets said, and the simple man dies, Galatians 5, this was interesting as I studied this week to realize again, Galatians 5, great chapter, in the first part of Galatians 5, we have the list of the fruit of the spirit, the fruit of the spirit, those characteristics of the individual who is truly indwelled by the spirit of God, and then along with the fruit of the spirit comes the listing of the deeds of the flesh, the deeds of the flesh, those characteristics of one who isn't led by the spirit, who has not experienced the spirits indwelling, and in that list of the deeds of the flesh, which is quite a list, look at 5-19, now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enity, strife, there it is, say it.
[time=1474] Jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying drunkenness, carousing, and things like these of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you in the past, those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God, don't be jealous.
[time=1499] Be careful, be very, very careful.
[time=1506] Be gracious.
[time=1510] I know, I know what it's like.
[time=1515] I know what it feels like to want what they have.
[time=1520] I understand what it feels like to be confused by their blessing and your seeming lack of.
[time=1527] I know what it's like to see someone get something you always wanted.
[time=1533] And God reminds you and I this morning, my friends,
[time=1539] be gracious, be kind.
[time=1543] You know what's really at the root here, trust.
[time=1546] Listen, don't be jealous, trust that what God allows.
[time=1551] Really, this is a discussion about the sovereignty and providence of God, isn't it?
[time=1557] Amen?
[time=1558] It's really what this is about.
[time=1560] If God is really on the throne and if God is really good and if God is truly sovereign and nothing comes his way or nothing comes her way or nothing comes that family's way
[time=1575] that God in his sovereignty doesn't allow then whatever God allows, I can see and I can call good and right.
[time=1586] And I might be confused by it and it might be hard
[time=1593] at some level, it's okay.
[time=1596] But be gracious, don't get jealous.
[time=1600] Be kind, love your neighbor, love them.
[time=1605] I'll just leave you with this on this point.
[time=1612] It's true, the scriptures teach it and in 22, 23 years of ministry I have seen it and I have seen it at levels my friends that would absolutely blow your mind and break your heart.
[time=1625] These are true, what I'm about to tell you right here, unconfessed, unchecked jealousy.
[time=1630] You can write it down.
[time=1632] Unconfessed, unchecked jealousy will lead to a hardened heart.
[time=1639] The more and more you foster it, the more and more you give yourself to it, the more and more you sit and stew and fret and wrestle and say to yourself and sometimes even to others your angry words about them and him or her and why he got that or why she's this way.
[time=1660] The more and more you go down that road, the harder and harder this will get, the smaller it will get, the stiffer it will get.
[time=1669] The more distant you will become from God,
[time=1675] the more difficult you will be to be around, unconfessed, unchecked jealousy leads to a hardened heart.
[time=1683] You know what else it leads to?
[time=1684] Write it down, a prideful spirit.
[time=1687] Watch how this works.
[time=1688] Here's what happens, I've seen it.
[time=1690] Not only have I seen it, I've done it.
[time=1693] All right?
[time=1695] It leads to a prideful spirit.
[time=1697] By that I mean I get so sick and tired of looking at how good he is.
[time=1704] I get so fed up with living with the disappointment that they got this and I didn't that I then begin to fixate on what I do have and what I am good at and what I have been gifted with and I become so fixated on somehow trying to get myself to a level where I feel as good about me as everybody must feel about them that I get prideful and I get arrogant and I get consumed with wanting to look a certain way and have people view me in a certain way and I get a prideful spirit instead of a soft spirit because my heart's been hardened because it hasn't been confessed, it hasn't been checked.
[time=1750] Unconfessed jealousy leads to a hardened heart and a prideful spirit and then here's the kicker and it always happens.
[time=1761] It leads to ruined relationships.
[time=1767] It just flat out gets to the point where to quote the scriptures I hate you and sometimes I hate you even more
[time=1780] and you hate him and she hates her and down in our souls and our spirits we just start hating people 'cause we're so jealous and we're so ticked and we're so envious and we're so upset and we've so walked away from a trust and a sovereign good God and we've gotten this thing to just be a personal vendetta and the heart gets heart and the pride goes up and the relationship forget you.
[time=1811] I don't even wanna be around you.
[time=1812] I don't even wanna talk to you.
[time=1814] I wanna avoid you at all costs 'cause all you represent to me is how I got ripped off and boom, it's broken.
[time=1826] And the body of Christ that he designed to live in unity lives in disunity and there's fractures and breaks 'cause jealousy got a root, it got watered a little bit
[time=1840] and boom, it's a mess.
[time=1842] One of the brothers stood up and said ah,
[time=1849] let's not kill him, let's just throw him in a pit.
[time=1853] But we'll just throw him in a pit and we'll sell him to the slave traders that come by here all the time and that leads us to our second segment of his life.
[time=1862] Again, so many things we could say in each but we'll just pick one lesson from each segment, the servant years, if you wanna call it that.
[time=1871] And here's our tagline, here's what you wanna remember as we go through this, be faithful my friends, be faithful in your adversity, be faithful.
[time=1880] Do not give up on God, do not walk away in tough times, dig deep or hold on tighter when it gets challenging.
[time=1890] When the waves get high, when the winds blow really hard, what we see here is one who hung in there as cliche or as trite as it might sound to you, it is profoundly true and wait, just wait until you see this for some of you in the room this morning, this is a revisit for others of you, it's the first time, you've heard of this amazing epic story of this young man and where he went and what God did with him.
[time=1918] Here we go, 39 verse one, 39 verse one.
[time=1923] Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt, stop right there, just real quick, they really did throw him in a pit, they roughed him up a bit, they threw him in this ditch and then they see the slave traders, nomads, ishmaelites, I think is what they were called and they're known for taking slaves and selling them and getting rid of them and this slave train was actually headed to Egypt and so anybody see the movie Braveheart, raise your hand if you've seen the movie Braveheart.
[time=1953] All right, yeah, in Braveheart you'll remember Russell Crowe's character gets sold as a slave and you remember that scene where they're carrying him and that buggy and he's on his back and he's in chains and shackles and he's laying on his back in this carton, the bamboo shoots are down on his face, this is Joseph on his way to Egypt, he's just a kid who said too much, he was a little youthful and his brothers were jealous and they hated him and they sell him as a slave to this band of slave traders and he ends up a thousand miles away in Egypt.
[time=1988] 391 and Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the bodyguard, this guy was way up on the chain, bought him from the ishmaelites who had taken him down there, the Lord was with Joseph, the Lord was with Joseph so he became a successful man.
[time=2012] It's a good place to stop there just for a moment, sorry for all these side notes.
[time=2019] I know a lot of you are reading books these days.
[time=2022] I know there's a lot of seminars out there on success.
[time=2026] I know people are paying millions and millions of dollars to figure out how to be successful, don't forget that Joseph was a successful man because the Lord was with him.
[time=2045] He was close to the Lord and the Lord was with him and he was successful, that's just a side note.
[time=2055] And he was in the house of his master of the Egyptian, look at verse three, now his master saw that the Lord was with him and how the Lord caused all that he did to prosper in his hand.
[time=2070] So Joseph found favor in his sight and became Potiphar's personal servant and he, Potiphar, made him Joseph, overseer over his house and all that he owned, he put in his charge.
[time=2084] It came about from the time he made him overseer in his house and over all that he owned, the Lord blessed the Egyptians house on account of Joseph.
[time=2095] Thus the Lord's blessing was upon all that he owned in the house and in the field so he left, listen, so he left everything he owned in Joseph's charge and with him there, Potiphar did not concern himself with anything except the food which he ate.
[time=2116] He stays faithful in the midst of what would have most
[time=2123] assuredly been unbelievably unsettling and confusing.
[time=2128] He hops off the slave block, bought by a guy he didn't know away from his dad and all that he had known and all he knows to do is just be faithful and just do what my dad and mom taught me here.
[time=2144] Sounds like Daniel, sounds like Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego with Nebuchadnezzar and Babylon.
[time=2150] You can change our names and you can teach us your education but we're not gonna eat that food.
[time=2156] I'm sorry, God told us through our parents that we weren't supposed to so no go on the stake in Cabernet.
[time=2163] Joseph, he's just a kid, he just stays faithful
[time=2171] and man, Potiphar, Potiphar puts his arms around him, Potiphar gives him everything he owned.
[time=2182] Now Joseph was handsome and form an appearance.
[time=2187] It came about after these events that his master's wife looked with desire at Joseph and she said lie with me but he refused, do you see that?
[time=2200] But he refused and said to his master's wife, behold, this is great.
[time=2204] You should just like capture this and put this on your teenage sons and your young adult sons and daughters, you know, they should just have this with them.
[time=2213] This is just so unbelievably filled with integrity and character, behold, he said with me here, my master does not concern himself with anything in the house and he has put all that he owns in my charge.
[time=2227] There is no one greater in this house than I and he has withheld nothing from me except you because you are his wife.
[time=2235] Don't you wish you could have been there?
[time=2240] How then I love this?
[time=2242] How then could I do this great evil and sin against God?
[time=2247] I love that phrase.
[time=2248] He's so devoted, he's so in, he's so focused.
[time=2252] He actually says like, how could I even do it?
[time=2256] And I won't speak for you, I'll speak for me.
[time=2260] I can think of about 10 ways I can do things at times.
[time=2267] But he's just like, are you serious?
[time=2271] How could I with all that God has done
[time=2277] and all that your husband has offered?
[time=2279] How could I even think about it?
[time=2282] How could I do this great evil and sin against potifers?
[time=2287] Is that what it says?
[time=2288] No, don't miss that.
[time=2291] How could I do this great evil and sin against God?
[time=2296] As she spoke to Joseph day after day, he did not listen to her to lie beside her or be with her.
[time=2304] Now it happened one day that he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the household was there inside, she caught him by his garment.
[time=2314] You think she's been up in the ante a little bit as the days go by?
[time=2318] I think she may have tried on a new dress or two.
[time=2321] Think she was devoted, think she was dedicated, think she was desperate, think she was aggressive, absolutely.
[time=2328] Now she just physically accosts him.
[time=2332] Lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and went outside.
[time=2339] He runs so fast, he leaves his coat in her clutches.
[time=2344] When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside, she called to the men of her household and said to them, see he has brought in a Hebrew to make to us to make sport of us.
[time=2354] He came in to me to lie with me and I screamed.
[time=2358] And when he heard that I raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled and went outside.
[time=2364] So she left his garment beside her until his master came home, pot of her returns.
[time=2370] Wow.
[time=2371] Then she spoke to him with these words, the Hebrew slave whom you brought to us came into me to make sport of me.
[time=2380] And as I raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled outside.
[time=2386] Amazing story, completely hosed by his brothers,
[time=2393] sold as a slave in the slavery, caravan down to Egypt like an animal, bought by one of the highest ranking officials in all of Egypt, away from his dad, he's a slave, he's a thousand miles away from home.
[time=2405] And all he does is serve that man and his estate with the absolute highest level of character, integrity and excellence, he's prudent wise, discerning and shrewd, he gives leadership, he honors pot of her, he helps grow and establish pot of her's wealth and reputation, he's in a distant land in a very difficult position, but he gets up every day and in essence says, I don't get any of this, he must have been confused, but I will do day after day
[time=2438] the right thing, then on top of it all, the Mrs. comes after him and he still does the right thing.
[time=2449] How about you?
[time=2450] Have you ever in the past or maybe even today, you might be experiencing this to some degree, you've really been pretty faithful, you've really been trying to obey and honor the Lord and you're just getting slaughtered.
[time=2468] You just keep getting hit by challenges and heartaches and trials that because you know God and you do understand how this works, you know that he is allowing it.
[time=2482] And I want to say to you this morning if that's you to any degree, I want to remind you that though you may hear differently from others, I will stand here and tell you it's okay if that's you, it's okay to struggle, it's okay to wrestle with him on these things, it's okay to sit with a dear friend and just cry your eyes out, it's okay to wonder what's going on, it's not wrong to struggle, it's not wrong to wonder, it's not wrong to cry and weep and punch a pillow and say, wow, what's going on here, what's wrong or what can go wrong is where you go with your struggle, what you do with your struggle, choices that get made, things that get said and there's one of two choices that people make in this place.
[time=2540] Number one, they get fed up with God, they've tried and tried and tried in their mind to be faithful, the faithfulness has led to more heartache and more challenge and more difficulty and they just get to a point and they say that's it, I'm fed up with walking this road, even though Romans eight says he causes all things to work together, he obviously missed this one because it never came together for good and I'm done and there are those that do that, they get fed up with God and walk on their own away from a life of faithfulness and a life of trusting
[time=2581] and a life of continuing to follow.
[time=2583] The second choice is, and I've seen this, I've seen this from some of you in this room and in your choosing of this, you've inspired me.
[time=2593] I've seen this from people here in this family and in your willingness to go this direction, you have encouraged and you have impacted me and others.
[time=2603] There are some who in the midst of general faithfulness and obedience and continued efforts to do what God has called them to do, they just keep taking hits, they just keep facing challenges, the trials seem to get bigger and what they do is they devote themselves to him at an even deeper level.
[time=2623] They do the opposite of being fed up and walking,
[time=2629] they devote themselves to him at an even deeper level and walk with him intimately, graciously, patiently with a trusting spirit, refusing to allow the enemy who was behind all of this to move them away from faith and toward doubt.
[time=2649] What a lesson for us to learn from the life of David.
[time=2656] Potiphar comes home, now when his master heard
[time=2663] the words of his wife, which she spoke to him saying, "This is what your slave did to me." His Potiphar's anger burned.
[time=2670] So Joseph's master took him and put him into the jail, the place where the king's prisoners were confined and he was there in jail.
[time=2682] But the Lord was with Joseph, an extended kindness to him and gave him favor in the sight of the chief jailer.
[time=2692] You see that there in 21.
[time=2695] 22, the chief jailer committed to Joseph's charge all the prisoners who were in the jail.
[time=2701] So that whatever was done there, he was responsible for it.
[time=2705] See, the more he trusted the Lord, the more he continued to walk in faithfulness, the more, even though in the midst of difficulty, the Lord blesses him, the more opportunity the Lord seems to give him, the darker it gets, the broader, the spectrum of possibility and opportunity that God provides.
[time=2726] The chief jailer did not supervise anything under Joseph's charge because the Lord was what?
[time=2732] Say it with him.
[time=2734] And whatever he did, the Lord made to prosper.
[time=2739] Now you think, you think he's experienced some blessing.
[time=2744] I mean, you think the Lord's been with him and caused him to prosper because of his faithfulness.
[time=2749] Just, wow, just hang on.
[time=2751] You ready?
[time=2752] Here comes the third segment of his life.
[time=2754] Go to chapter 41.
[time=2756] In chapter 41, verse 14, I'll give you a little bit of backdrop under the heading of ruler king.
[time=2761] Be humble and hardworking in your success.
[time=2764] I'm gonna say that to you again.
[time=2765] There are some of you in the room this morning and you're not taking a hit after a hit.
[time=2768] You're not flat on your back in the face of adversity that won't seem to quit.
[time=2773] There are some of you in the room this morning and you are basking in a season of blessing and reward
[time=2780] and you couldn't be happier with the way things are going and that's okay too.
[time=2786] In the midst of that, look at the lesson that Joseph allows you and I to learn 41, 14.
[time=2792] What's happened is that he went to jail.
[time=2794] In jail, in the midst of all these responsibilities the jailer gave him.
[time=2798] He meets two guys who were really on the outs with Pharaoh.
[time=2802] They get tossed in prison.
[time=2804] They have dreams.
[time=2805] Joseph interprets their dreams.
[time=2808] Later on, they get released.
[time=2810] He says to them, "Hey, don't forget me." When you get out there and they say, "Yeah, yeah, thanks." They forget him and time goes by a couple of years or so.
[time=2819] A couple of years or so he's in the dungeon, it says.
[time=2825] Okay, he didn't do anything wrong.
[time=2830] He may have said some youthful things to his brothers
[time=2836] but he didn't deserve to get hijacked out of his life and all he did when he got to Egypt was just honor that guy.
[time=2843] He didn't steal anything, he didn't take anything, he didn't misuse anything and when his wife came after him all he said to her was, "No thanks, I would never." And now he's in jail and he gets into jail and he stays faithful and the chief jailer rewards him and now things might be looking up and the two guys leave but they forget him and now he's just in jail and now he's just been there.
[time=2869] Pharaoh has a dream and nobody can interpret the dream and so he's like, "Somebody interpret my dream." And then one of the dudes who was in jail goes, "Oh, wait a minute, there was that guy." And they tell Pharaoh about Joseph and here we go 14, just hang on to your seats, incredible, incredible story.
[time=2890] And Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph and they hurriedly brought him out of the dungeon.
[time=2897] Now the wording there is important, they didn't bring him out of jail and they didn't bring him out of prison, they brought him out of the dungeon.
[time=2903] At this point now he's made his way to the lowest place you can go.
[time=2908] He's with the forgotten ones, don't miss that.
[time=2912] They go and get Joseph and by now he's in the dungeon and when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, I just keep thinking of Tom Hanks and Castaway.
[time=2924] When he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came to Pharaoh.
[time=2928] Okay, he's just out of the dungeon.
[time=2931] He's just been through all of this.
[time=2933] The door opens, the light breaks through, they drag him out, shave him, put some clothes on him.
[time=2938] How are you doing if you're Joseph?
[time=2939] Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I've had a dream, "but no one can interpret it." And I've heard it said about you that when you hear a dream, you can interpret it.
[time=2946] Joseph, then, right out of the slammer answered Pharaoh saying, "It is about time." I'm telling you, dude, I used to be devoted to this Jehovah guy.
[time=2959] He's nothing but a loser.
[time=2960] I'm with you, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.
[time=2963] But no, right out of the gate, Joseph answered Pharaoh saying, "It is not in me.
[time=2973] "God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer." Pharaoh killed people for saying less.
[time=2983] And he just gets out of the dungeon and he rolls out with the confidence and the character and the integrity of one who in the midst of unbelievable adversity is faithful.
[time=2994] So Pharaoh spoke to Joseph.
[time=2997] "In my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank "of the Nile and behold seven cows, fat and sleek, "ever have quite understood that combo, "but fat and sleek came up out of the Nile.
[time=3008] "And they grazed in the marsh grass.
[time=3009] "Whoa, seven other cows came up after them.
[time=3012] "Pore and very ugly and gaunt, "such as I had never seen for ugliness "in all the land of Egypt.
[time=3019] "And the lean and ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows, "yet when they had devoured them, "it could not be detected that they had devoured them "for they were just as ugly as before.
[time=3031] "Then I awoke.
[time=3033] "I saw also in my dream and behold seven ears corn.
[time=3037] "Fool and good came up on a single stock "and lo, seven ears of corn withered thin "and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.
[time=3047] "And the thin ears swallowed the seven good ears.
[time=3051] "Then I told it to the magicians, "but there was no one who could explain it to me.
[time=3057] "Now, Joseph said to Pharaoh, "Pharaoh's dreams are one and the same.
[time=3061] "God has told to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
[time=3066] "The seven good cows are seven years.
[time=3072] "The dreams are one and the same.
[time=3075] "The seven lean and ugly cows "that came up after them are seven years.
[time=3081] "And the seven thin ears of corn scorched by the east wind "will be seven years of famine.
[time=3088] "It is as I have spoken to Pharaoh.
[time=3091] "God has to listen to him.
[time=3093] "He's just throwing God in there.
[time=3094] "He's just proclaiming from a place of faith and reliance.
[time=3098] "God has shown to Pharaoh what he's about to do.
[time=3102] "Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming "in all the land of Egypt.
[time=3106] "And after them, seven years of famine will come "and all the abundance will be forgotten "in the land of Egypt and the famine will ravage the land.
[time=3116] "So the abundance will be unknown in the land "because of the subsequent famine, "for it will be very severe.
[time=3124] "Now as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, "it means that the matter is determined by God "and God will quickly bring it about.
[time=3134] "Now let Pharaoh look for a man discerning and wise," Joseph says, "and set him over the land of Egypt.
[time=3141] "Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers "in charge of the land and let him exact a fifth "of the produce of the land of Egypt "in the seven years of abundance." The stuff's just flowing out of him because the Lord was with him.
[time=3161] Let them then gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain for food in the city's under Pharaoh's authority and let them guard it.
[time=3173] Let the food become as they reserve for the land, for the seven years of famine which will occur in the land of Egypt so that the land will not perish during the famine.
[time=3183] Now the proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and to all of his servants.
[time=3188] Now watch this.
[time=3190] Then Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find a man like this "in whom is a divine spirit?" So Pharaoh said to Joseph, I know I'm reading a lot here, it's amazing.
[time=3205] When you study the New Testament, sometimes you just always grabbing little verses, they're packed with stuff, old Testament study, a little different, these are stories, these are narratives.
[time=3216] I hope you're not bored, I could read all day, this is fantastic stuff.
[time=3220] Watch what happens, blow your mind.
[time=3223] So Pharaoh, Pharaoh, the ruler of the then known world, basically.
[time=3231] King of kings over everyone, the supreme sovereign in the land, said to Joseph, since God has informed you of all this, there is no one so discerning and wise as you are.
[time=3248] You, Joseph, you shall be over my house.
[time=3252] And according to your command, all my people shall do homage.
[time=3258] Only in the throne I will be greater than you.
[time=3261] Pharaoh said to Joseph, "See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt." Then Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and he put it on Joseph's hand.
[time=3273] It's the ouch, you would only do that to your son.
[time=3277] You would only do that to a succeeding king.
[time=3280] And he clothed him in royal garments of fine linen and put the gold necklace around his neck.
[time=3287] It was a necklace that signified authority and supreme rule.
[time=3292] He had him ride in his second chariot.
[time=3296] And they proclaimed before him balcony.
[time=3301] And he set him over all the land of Egypt.
[time=3303] Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Though I am Pharaoh, "yet without your permission, "no one shall raise his hand or foot "in all the land of Egypt." Then Pharaoh named Joseph Zaphaneth Penea and he gave him Asyneth, the daughter of Potiphar, priest of on as his wife.
[time=3325] And Joseph went forth over the land of Egypt.
[time=3328] Now Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
[time=3335] And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and he bought a new chariot, got a tattoo,
[time=3346] kicked it by the Nile with his hot new wife and called it a day.
[time=3351] Is that what he did?
[time=3355] I mean, he just said, "Look at me." He said, "Can you have..." I mean, this is lottery stuff.
[time=3361] I mean, did he just, did he get all that and just go, "Hey, I think I'm just gonna get fat.
[time=3368] "I think I'm just gonna go lay by the pool, "have the dudes blow the palm branches at me, "order whatever I want." No, not at all.
[time=3379] No, he was humble and hardworking in the midst of the blessing and success that God had provided.
[time=3387] He was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
[time=3390] And when Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, went through all the land of Egypt.
[time=3395] During the seven years of plenty, the land brought forth abundantly.
[time=3399] So he, he oversees this whole thing.
[time=3402] He gathered all the food of these seven years which occurred in the land of Egypt and placed the food in the cities.
[time=3410] He placed in every city, the food from its own surrounding fields.
[time=3415] He uses all of his leadership.
[time=3417] He uses all of his administrative capacities.
[time=3420] He uses all of his energy and time to work hard and humbly for seven years to do and provide what he told his boss he would do.
[time=3428] And he did it well.
[time=3432] How well?
[time=3433] Then Joseph, thus 49, thus Joseph stored up grain in great abundance.
[time=3439] Wow, it's late, sorry.
[time=3440] Like the sand of the sea until he stopped measuring it for it was beyond, listen, it was beyond measure.
[time=3447] He did a really, really good job.
[time=3451] He stayed really, really humble.
[time=3454] He worked really, really hard and the Lord was with him.
[time=3458] I don't know where you're at this morning but you better stay a long way away from jealousy.
[time=3464] You better be willing in the midst of whatever your adversity looks like to stay faithful and grow even deeper in your love and trust in him.
[time=3474] And when he blesses you, be humble and work hard.
[time=3478] God, thanks for the morning.
[time=3479] Thanks for the great truth of your word.
[time=3481] Thank you for what it reminds us of.
[time=3484] We pray, God, you'll give us strength to have character and integrity in your son's name.
[time=3488] We pray, amen.
[time=3490] (upbeat music)
