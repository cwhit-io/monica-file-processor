[time=308] Well, good morning, everyone.
[time=309] My name is Steve Webster, and I've had the great honor and privilege of serving at Black Hawk Christian School for the last seven years teaching social studies in Bible and serving as the Bible department chair.
[time=320] Over the last couple of years, Kelly and I have had conversations about the need for a teaching pastor, and I've been happy to fill that role in a part-time capacity.
[time=328] We're thrilled that in recent days, that role will be more official, and I'll be part of the staff here at the church, and I could not be more excited about that.
[time=337] My wife, Jody and I, my wife of 11 years yesterday, Jody and I are so thrilled to be a part of the staff here to be a part of the ministry that's serving God's kingdom and Fort Wayne with great diligence, with great passion, with great conviction, could not be more excited.
[time=353] I've loved this place.
[time=354] The people of this place have been a constant encouragement to us, a constant encouragement to my family, to be making friends with these people has been just a marvelous thing.
[time=364] Kelly has been a personal encouragement to me, his friendship, his leadership, his patience, his diligence has been hugely appreciated.
[time=373] Black Hawk Christian School is in a season of change and a season of transition into a really wonderful and encouraging future.
[time=379] I'm not leaving that side of it.
[time=381] I'm so excited to be part of the school as well and the church.
[time=384] You'll be seeing me more regularly here in the Bible Hour.
[time=387] That's a huge excitement to us as well to be teaching on Sunday morning and throughout the week at the Christian School.
[time=392] I'm terribly, terribly excited about the future, about the present of this place.
[time=397] This morning, you'll be hearing me talk a little bit about Gideon.
[time=401] Gideon is one of the most profound examples of the grace of God that I've seen anywhere in Scripture.
[time=406] Gideon is a man who is flawed, who is fearful, who is doubtful, who is a little bit resentful at times.
[time=414] In that way, I find huge levels of resonance with Gideon.
[time=417] He's just like me. He's a mixed bag. He gets it and he doesn't get it.
[time=421] I'm so thrilled to talk to you about it.
[time=423] Thank you for tuning in this morning. We hope to see you very, very soon.
[time=440] Thank you for tuning in this morning.
[time=2901] I'll say that.
[time=2902] It's worth repeating.
[time=2903] Those that trust in him will never have any reason to be ashamed.
[time=2906] He will never forsake you.
[time=2908] He will never leave you.
[time=2910] Jesus says in John 16, I have overcome the world.
[time=2914] Remember, Gideon is on this crash course.
[time=2928] I just, the takeaways, as Corbin's already said, is that his grace is amazing.
[time=2933] His grace is amazing.
[time=2936] People of Israel did not remember, friends, in verse 34.
[time=2939] They did not remember the Lord their God.
[time=2944] Hebrews 11 is the final word on Gideon.
[time=2947] My grandmother and my grandfather work with the Gideon's for many years.
[time=2952] And she gives these out every chance she's here today.
[time=2956] She gives these out every chance she can.
[time=2958] Do you remember what we'll see them from her?
[time=2961] And the Gideon's took their name as an organization.
[time=2964] There's a little picture of a pot with a torch in there.
[time=2967] Can you see?
[time=2968] You probably can't see that.
[time=2969] They took their name from Gideon because of his strength and because of his perseverance and his might.
[time=2976] And I just, that by itself is the grace of God.
[time=2980] They would have that evaluation of Gideon.
[time=2982] Look at Hebrews 11, verse 32.
[time=2984] And I'm with the author of Hebrews.
[time=2986] What more so I say?
[time=2988] Time would fail me and me too to tell of Gideon.
[time=2993] There's whole chapters about faith and the heroes of the faith.
[time=2996] Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephthah.
[time=3004] Samson is a guy who's compromised at all kinds of levels.
[time=3007] And there he is in the faith hall of fame.
[time=3010] Jephthah makes a rash vow and condemns his daughter to probably death but maybe just exile.
[time=3016] Either way it's terrible.
[time=3018] And this is God's evaluation of these people as they are committed for their faith.
[time=3022] You and I are not defined by the worst moments of our lives.
[time=3028] We are not.
[time=3029] Same as the de terrible things.
[time=3031] Gideon de terrible things.
[time=3033] Jephthah de terrible things.
[time=3034] And there they are in Hebrews 11.
[time=3036] And if you are called by his name, there you are too.
[time=3039] You're there friends.
[time=3042] We are not existentialists.
[time=3045] We aren't defined by what we do.
[time=3049] My experience doesn't create a new person in me.
[time=3052] Who I am informs what I do.
[time=3057] Augustine said, "It's not that we keep God's commands and then we love him.
[time=3062] It's that he loves and then he loves us.
[time=3064] It's that he loves us and we keep his commands." That's grace.
[time=3069] God doesn't say, "Hey, that guy keeps my commands.
[time=3071] I sure like him a lot.
[time=3073] Let's hang out." It's not how it works.
[time=3076] His grace is amazing.
[time=3078] That's the last word on Gideon.
[time=3080] Listen to the lyrics of the song that we're about to hear friends.
[time=3085] Listen to the thing in which we are to stand in response to what you've just heard from judges,
[time=3093] chapter 6, 7, and 8, in the story of Gideon.
[time=3096] The last word for Gideon, I hope is the last word for me.
[time=3102] Remember who you are.
[time=3104] Remember who he is.
[time=3106] Remember that his grace is amazing.
[time=3124] No mountain, no valley, no gain or loss we know.
[time=3134] You keep us from your love, no sickness, no secrets.
[time=3146] No chain is strong enough to keep us from your love, to keep us from your love.
[time=3161] No matter where I am, healing is in your dreams.
[time=3183] How deep will I stand?
[time=3195] Remember your grace, I stand, healing is in your hands.
[time=3212] The present of a future, our past is in your hands.
[time=3221] We're covered by your love, covered by your love.
[time=3231] How wide, how wide, no matter where I am, healing is in your hands.
[time=3253] How deep, how strong, now by your grace, I stand, healing is in your hands.
[time=3281] In all things, we know that we are more than conquerors.
[time=3290] You keep us by your love.
[time=3296] In all things, we know that we are more than conquerors.
[time=3307] You keep us by your love.
[time=3313] You keep us by your love, no height, no height.
[time=3328] No matter where I am, healing is in your hands.
[time=3340] How deep, how strong, now by your grace, I stand, healing is in your hands.
[time=3357] How deep will I stand, healing is in your hands.
[time=3372] We will remember, we will remember, we will remember the works of your hands.
[time=3386] We will stop and give you praise, for praise is thy faithfulness.
[time=3397] Just remember, together, we will remember, we will remember, we will remember the works of your hands.
[time=3411] We will stop and give you praise, for praise is thy faithfulness.
[time=3423] So one more time, we will remember, we will remember, we will remember the works of your hands.
[time=3437] We will stop and give you praise, for praise is thy faithfulness.
[time=3452] Kelly and I and the elders will be up here after this service if you need to come pray and receive God's grace.
[time=3472] I want to leave you with this benediction before Kelly gives some announcements.
[time=3476] In Romans 16 verse 20, the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly.
[time=3486] The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you. Amen.
