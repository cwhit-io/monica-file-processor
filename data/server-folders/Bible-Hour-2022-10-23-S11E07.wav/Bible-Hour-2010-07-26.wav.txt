[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] [MUSIC - 85 seconds]
[time=121] Hey man, thanks for singing that out with us.
[time=141] You may be seated.
[time=146] And if you didn't notice already this morning, those songs that we sang are kind of tied together with the theme.
[time=153] You know, we sang whatever my lot.
[time=155] God's taught me to say it's well.
[time=157] We sang even when you don't move God in a way that I would have planned, still I will worship you.
[time=164] Or we sang at the beginning when you walked in.
[time=166] When the sun shining down on me or when I walked through a desert place, either way, I'm gonna say blessed be your name.
[time=175] You know, if you read the book of Psalms and I hope that you do, you'll probably see in there a huge variety of songs that address so many different situations of life.
[time=186] John Calvin, I learned a few months ago actually called the Psalms an anatomy of the soul.
[time=193] And he basically was saying when you read the book of Psalms, you get to learn all the different phases and components of your soul.
[time=200] The Psalms celebrate and rejoice and they sing hallelujah.
[time=205] But the Psalms also speak of great grief and trial and pain.
[time=210] The Psalms actually even express worship through anger and frustration at the injustices of life.
[time=218] The Psalms look at hard circumstances and declare hopeful trust and confidence in who God is.
[time=227] And so occasionally we like to do songs like that that express worship through a variety of situations, through a variety of life circumstances.
[time=239] There's another one that we sing a lot called the desert song, where we sing, "I will bring praise, no weapon formed against me shall remain." And we're gonna talk a little bit about that song this morning before we sing it.
[time=252] Hopefully you got one of these little bags with you when you walked in today.
[time=256] And these bags have a little tag in them that says, "All my life, I have a reason to worship." And I hope that you'll take these with you today and that you'll understand that God's worth and the praise of God's worth is not contingent upon your life circumstances.
[time=273] We talk about it a lot, we sing about it a lot, but today we're just gonna think about it a little bit more.
[time=277] There's four objects in your bag today and each object represents a prayer from this song that we sing, the desert song.
[time=285] We sing about this is my prayer in the desert and this is my prayer in the battle and my prayer in the fire and my prayer in the harvest.
[time=293] So we're just gonna talk and think about each of those prayers this morning kind of as we sing the song.
[time=299] The first verse of the song says, this is my prayer in the desert and that piece of sandpaper in your bag is supposed to remind us of the desert seasons that God allows us to go through.
[time=312] And the desert is dry and the desert is a place that doesn't have natural resources and it's a place that makes us dependent.
[time=319] But like sandpaper, the desert can also refine us and shape us and smooth out the rough edges in our lives.
[time=328] The deserts actually mention a lot in the Bible.
[time=331] The whole nation of Israel wanted in the desert for 40 years and they watched God feed them every day with bread and with meat with an incredible experience for them.
[time=340] Moses was kind of trained up for leadership in the desert, Joshua spent time training for his leadership in the desert.
[time=348] John the Baptist spent a season of life in the desert in Jesus, actually fasted for 40 days and nights in the desert.
[time=356] And those are literal deserts, but I think the principle that we can take away from those is this, all of those guys, Jesus, John the Baptist, Moses, the nation of Israel, they learned some really valuable lessons in the midst of their desert experience.
[time=372] And if you feel like your soul's going through a desert today, I just want to give you an encouragement to desperately hang on to God in the midst of your desert and find out God, what do you want me to learn about who you are in my desert and how do you want to refine to me and mold me and shape me in the middle of my desert?
[time=390] Let me leave you with a verse.
[time=393] If you find yourself in the desert today, deserts a place where you're thirsty, right?
[time=398] And Matthew five tells us what to thirst for.
[time=402] Matthew five, verse six is blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
[time=409] Let's sing together this prayer in the desert this morning.
[time=414] [MUSIC - 17 seconds]
[time=435] We're also singing that same song
[time=441] about the season of fire.
[time=442] The match stick in your bag represents that season or situation, the fire is, it's the testing of life.
[time=451] And the verse of the song says in weakness or trial and pain.
[time=456] I thought we should just think about those a little bit together.
[time=458] Maybe this morning you feel weak, maybe it's your physical health that makes you weak or some an emotionally drained situation that just makes you feel weak.
[time=469] Or maybe you have spiritual insecurity that you're battling this morning that makes you feel weak, weakness and trial.
[time=477] Maybe there's a trial in your life, maybe a really difficult situation at work, maybe a really difficult relationship with someone that you love a lot, but it's just not going well.
[time=487] Maybe you're experiencing literal opposition to your faith in God, maybe you're being persecuted this morning.
[time=495] Sometimes we experience pain, deep pain when someone we love a whole lot dies.
[time=502] Deep pain when a close friend has to move away or deep pain when there's a relationship that's turning sour.
[time=509] Let me remind you this morning in the midst of your fire that there's a reason for this testing and there's a reason for the fire.
[time=519] The Bible tells us that God subjugates all of those circumstances for our good and that He doesn't allow anything come to us, to come to us unless He's got a good reason behind it.
[time=531] He wants to refine you, wants to strengthen your faith.
[time=534] 1 Peter 1, 7 says this, these trials,
[time=541] these have come so that your faith may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus is revealed.
[time=549] And Psalm 66 reminds us that for you, oh God tested us, you refined us like silver.
[time=558] And you don't just refine silver to make it hot, you refine it with purpose and with great intention.
[time=564] So let's sing a prayer this morning for those of you who are facing a fire.
[time=572] [MUSIC - 15 seconds]
[time=592] Also in your bag this morning is a sword
[time=598] that represents the battles in life that we face.
[time=601] Maybe you have a particular sin that you feel like you're battling this morning or a particular external circumstance that feels like a real battle to you.
[time=610] Maybe you feel like the enemy and the dominions of darkness are just attacking you and what you feel like God wants you to do and that's a real battle.
[time=622] 1 John also says that all of us battle against the world and the flesh around us, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life, that's a real battle that we're all engaged in together.
[time=633] But we should remember some things when we fight.
[time=635] This song says, "This is my prayer in the battle when triumph is still on its way." The triumph is coming.
[time=644] Kelly preached a few weeks ago about how the war is over but the enemy's firing off as many bullets as he can on his way down.
[time=652] We need to remember that ultimately triumph is on its way and we need to remember until then that we are conquerors and co-heirs with Christ.
[time=660] Romans 8, 17 says that we are heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.
[time=667] In the midst of a battle, it's really hard to remember that that's how God defines you.
[time=671] Romans 8, 37 says, "No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through Him hulaapness." So if you feel beaten down in your battle today, remember the truth of these scriptures and let's pray this prayer together.
[time=688] This is my prayer in the battle when triumph is still on its way.
[time=693] I am a conqueror who co-heirs with Christ.
[time=697] So we'll stand firm in His promises.
[time=699] [MUSIC] The triumph is still on its way
[time=713] [MUSIC] So firm on His promise I'll stand
[time=721] The song also talks about the harvests of life
[time=728] for those seasons where you feel blessed and encouraged.
[time=732] There's a responsibility with the harvests.
[time=734] Let's look at a couple of scriptures together.
[time=737] Ecclesiastes 11.
[time=739] Verse six says that we're just so our seed in the morning and that evening and never let our hands be idle.
[time=745] If you're in a season of harvest, you can't sit still and just enjoy it.
[time=748] You need to be producing and yielding more fruit for the kingdom.
[time=752] Galatians six says, "Let's not be overcome with weary or weary with doing good, but at the proper time reap a harvest if we do not give up.
[time=762] If you're in a harvest today, don't grow weary.
[time=765] Don't give up." Luke 815 when Jesus was talking about that parable of the seeds and the different soil that it falls on.
[time=773] He says the seed that fell on the good soil stands for those with a noble and a good heart.
[time=779] You hear the word retain it and persevere by producing a crop.
[time=782] If you're in a harvest today, hear the word retain it and produce more crop.
[time=787] John 12, Jesus also says this about seeds.
[time=793] I tell you the truth unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dyes, it remains only a single seed, but if it does die, it produces many seeds.
[time=804] And the song says, "I know I'm filled to be empty again.
[time=811] This seed I perceive that I will sow.
[time=813] Let's sing this together, prayer for the harvest." [MUSIC - 145 seconds]
[time=969] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 85 seconds]
[time=1063] - It's all staying and singing together.
[time=1067] [MUSIC - 147 seconds]
[time=1222] (gentle guitar music) God, this morning, we just want to pause to pray, God, that you would help us to understand how wide and how high and how deep your love is for us.
[time=1238] God, your love never changes.
[time=1243] It's always perfect and it's always filled with compassion and eagerness to forgive us.
[time=1252] God, we are grateful for your unchanging love, for your unchanging character this morning.
[time=1258] And when we come together to worship God, may we as a people not have our circumstances determining our worship of you, but may we have your character and your never-changing qualities determine our worship of you.
[time=1279] May it be so in the name of your son Jesus, we pray.
[time=1282] [AMEN] - It's my pleasure to introduce to you, Quentin Foppel, who is the remedy man, he's the brains, he's the visionary, he's the marketeer behind remedy.
[time=1295] And we're thankful being here as a friend of Blackhawk, and he's going to be sharing with us today.
[time=1298] Nehemiah.
[time=1300] - That's right. - There you go.
[time=1300] All right, welcome him.
[time=1301] - Thanks, Jesse.
[time=1302] (audience applauding) Thank you, everyone.
[time=1307] We are blessed to be with you guys this morning, Blackhawk, as a dear friend to remedy FM, and we're so pleased to be able to bring God's word to you today.
[time=1315] I want to introduce you to the most important folks in my life when we have a chance.
[time=1321] My wife, my little boy, Duke, are here in the front row, my little gangster, just three months old.
[time=1326] And then my twin two-year-olds are the tornadoes in the children's ministry right now, along with my four-year-old Ella.
[time=1333] And these, these little gangsters have really shown me what life's all about.
[time=1339] You know, I find that there's nowhere in the word of God where we're called adults of God.
[time=1345] You notice that?
[time=1348] We're always called children of God.
[time=1350] And I think that's because, you know, our daddy sees us as children and not as grown up, mature.
[time=1358] You know, we've got it all figured out kind of people.
[time=1362] And so I'm really excited to be able to introduce you to my family.
[time=1365] You know, this morning we're going to talk about Nehemiah.
[time=1367] And if you have a chance to open your Bible and get there, that would be a good start.
[time=1371] We're not going to get into text just yet.
[time=1373] But I want to tell you about where we're going to go this morning.
[time=1377] I'm going to talk about mourning.
[time=1378] And I know this is kind of a morbid subject.
[time=1381] It's not something that usually a guest speaker will come with, especially someone that leads a web-based ministry like we do.
[time=1387] And we're just so excited to be able to come with reports.
[time=1390] We've always been good, you know, giving reports to our churches.
[time=1394] But Kelly has been so wonderful to give us time, you know, just under three years.
[time=1398] Last year we had 131,000 viewers check out our content.
[time=1403] 21,000 chat conversations.
[time=1406] Last month we surpassed 2009's numbers.
[time=1409] So we will hit a quarter of a million viewers this year alone.
[time=1414] And it's been through the prayers of the saints of people like you that have supported us with this organization and if there's any passion in your heart to help us financially or otherwise, we do need 12 families to come alongside us in these days so that we can continue to reach out.
[time=1428] Because as our numbers expand, of course, and our audience expands through broadcast media, we have to continue to grow.
[time=1435] So thank you so much for this opportunity.
[time=1437] But I'm going to talk about mourning today.
[time=1440] And I don't know when the first time you experienced mourning, but I remember, you know, I was just a little guy.
[time=1445] I was probably about nine years old.
[time=1446] And I was staying at my step-sister's house.
[time=1449] You know, I was really young and my step-sister was quite a bit older than she had kids.
[time=1453] And I enjoyed going to their home because they had toys.
[time=1457] They had lots of fun things to play with.
[time=1459] And they weren't my toys, so I could break them.
[time=1462] And I remember we were over there for a weekend and I woke up one morning and there was a somber mood over the house.
[time=1470] I could tell that even at that age that something was wrong.
[time=1475] And one of the other little kids who obviously wasn't very good at reporting bad news, ran after me and said, your dad is dead.
[time=1484] Ha ha, your dad's dead.
[time=1488] And I fell, pardon?
[time=1490] You know, it wasn't my birth father, but he was my step-father.
[time=1494] And what had happened the night before is my step-dad, who, of course, was staying at the home that we lived in.
[time=1500] But I was away at my step-sisters.
[time=1503] He had died of affixiation.
[time=1506] And the chimney had become blocked.
[time=1507] And they'd found him in the hallway on this way to the bathroom collapsed on the floor.
[time=1512] And I was introduced to mourning, to death.
[time=1518] I remember my mom really having a hard time with this.
[time=1520] She had been through a really difficult marriage with my father, who was abusive and alcoholic.
[time=1525] And so she'd found this man that she really loved.
[time=1529] He really seemed to be the kind of guy that was considerate of her.
[time=1532] He had a ranch.
[time=1533] He had 13 horses, which she loved.
[time=1535] And now that was all gone.
[time=1539] And I remember my mother just weeping and weeping and weeping.
[time=1543] And she was so broken from this time where she was realizing that her best friend and her husband was no longer on Earth.
[time=1554] You know, I think that mourning brings clarity.
[time=1558] Mourning brings clarity.
[time=1560] There's a rule sobering that comes over the human psyche, over the human mind.
[time=1565] When we go through hard times-- and I don't know where you're at this morning in this world of mourning.
[time=1570] I think we could easily go to death when we think mourning.
[time=1573] But you may be mourning a lot of things today.
[time=1575] You may be mourning the loss of a relationship.
[time=1580] Maybe the loss of a mortgage of your house.
[time=1583] Maybe the loss of your physical that now you're dealing with a disease, and you don't know what that's going to look like.
[time=1590] Maybe you're in the midst of some other kind of mourning.
[time=1594] But I think that mourning does something for us as humans where it kind of wakes us up and we start to think differently about the days that we've been given.
[time=1604] A few years ago when I was on staff at Fellowship Missionary Church, there was a fairly public situation that was in the media.
[time=1611] But a few months before that, I found myself at Stillwater Camp doing what I love to do, baptisms.
[time=1617] And I was baptizing some young men and women.
[time=1620] And this young man came up to me.
[time=1621] He was in his 20s and I baptized him.
[time=1624] And I remember him saying to me, his name is Mike, that he wanted to put his flag in the sand and live the rest of his days with purpose, with strategy, living by God's way, not his way.
[time=1640] And I remember us going into that little pond together and me putting Mike below the water and him coming out, truly sharing in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, kind of a brand new creature.
[time=1650] Now, he wasn't saved by his baptism, but indeed, that baptism was a landing symbol of him saying goodbye to the old.
[time=1659] Well, I was at home one night and I got a phone call from one of my fellow church members saying, did you hear about Mike?
[time=1667] I said, no, I don't know what you're talking about.
[time=1669] And she said, well, last night, there was a auto accident.
[time=1676] And see, Mike had been driving down a very slippery road and he had come upon a car where a couple of teenagers, who'd maybe be going a little bit too fast on that kind of road condition, had lost control and ended up in the side of a pole and the electrical lines had come down on the car.
[time=1693] One of the teens died instantly.
[time=1695] And you see, Mike had pulled up to this accident with a new strategy in life, live boldly.
[time=1702] Live your life as if there is no end, it's only eternal, that there is a plan for your life to boldly charge ahead.
[time=1714] And so Mike pulled his vehicle over, ran over to the car, and pulled the living teenager out of the vehicle.
[time=1721] But while doing so and throwing the teenager to safety, Mike brushed up against an electrical cable and died instantly.
[time=1730] I was asked to come and do the funeral and I was pleased to do so because, again, I'm kind of weird this way.
[time=1735] I like doing funerals because this is a very sober time.
[time=1739] People are real.
[time=1740] They don't want to beat around the bush about what they did yesterday or how things are going with that bush and their garden.
[time=1748] They want to talk about real things.
[time=1750] And so I said I'd do the funeral absolutely.
[time=1753] And I remember being at that funeral and sharing Mike's story and I stood up there and I said, Mike is my hero.
[time=1762] Because here's a young man who decided to put his flag in the sand and say, I'm going to live with purpose.
[time=1767] I've got one life to live.
[time=1769] I'm going to live it with a strategic focus on God's word and there's no turning back.
[time=1776] And I believe when he saw that car on the side of the road, mangled and torn and with lives inside that car.
[time=1784] I don't think he thought twice.
[time=1787] He said, I'm going to do this.
[time=1790] And so I shared the story of how much I admired this young man and how he was no longer in that casket behind me but that he was with his father, God, his daddy.
[time=1800] And that Mike would want me to say to everyone in that funeral home, which by the way was packed with people out on the street.
[time=1807] You see, the news had spread everywhere.
[time=1809] In fact, if you didn't hear about it, it was on all the national networks as well of a hero that Mike was.
[time=1817] And they came to my home and they interviewed me.
[time=1820] And I said, Mike was a hero because of his faith.
[time=1825] And I stood up at that funeral and I said, Mike would want me to tell you that you two can live your life on purpose, that you two can put your flag in the sand and say, I am not going to live a mediocre life.
[time=1835] I am not going to live a life where I just kind of go through the motions, get up, go to work, come home, go to bed.
[time=1840] I am going to have a purpose.
[time=1842] I am going to live my life so when I end up on death's door, I can say I did it all to the glory of God.
[time=1851] And I said, who in this room do want to stand right now and receive the free gift that Jesus Christ offers us?
[time=1858] Like Mike did, live in boldly.
[time=1861] Well, I can tell you with integrity that over 25 people stood that day and made their steps and towards the kingdom of God to become, as we say within our church circles, born again, brand new creatures.
[time=1874] Now, why do I tell you that story?
[time=1875] Well, because in that morning, in that morning time, there was incredible clarity, incredible clarity for those people.
[time=1885] They saw their friend who was with them one day and was gone the next.
[time=1888] They saw the reality that time is not promised to you and I,
[time=1894] that we have to live with purpose.
[time=1896] And you know, I was thinking about this, and Kelly and I were talking about this morning.
[time=1901] And I said, you know what, I want to talk about something that I think is relevant.
[time=1905] And so I came up with this thought out of this time with Mike and I call it the morning slide.
[time=1911] Now, like any slide, I'm sure all of us have been at playgrounds.
[time=1915] I know with my children, I go regularly to a place called the Wooden Park.
[time=1919] I don't think it's named that, but my kids call it the Wooden Park because it's made out of wood.
[time=1922] Pretty amazing.
[time=1924] So we go to the Wooden Park and there's a slide there.
[time=1926] And like any slide, you go on the slide and where does the slide take you?
[time=1931] Down, right?
[time=1932] And so I thought about this morning slide that sometimes, and you may not be like me, maybe you're, you know, never going through tough times.
[time=1941] Maybe life is really good for you here at Black Hawk all the time, but sometimes I go through struggles and I go on these morning slides where I wake up a little bit down, a little bit discouraged.
[time=1952] Call it depressed, call it oppressed, call it deep contemplation, whatever you might want to call it.
[time=1959] It's a deep dark time where you find yourself kind of going down.
[time=1965] Whatever you call it, it's taking you on a journey.
[time=1970] And I'll call it for this morning's purposes, the morning slide.
[time=1977] I have to ask you what slide maybe has God taken you on lately.
[time=1982] Again, it could be financial, it could be physical, it could be relational.
[time=1986] It could still be that same personal journey you've been on since a child when maybe you were abused.
[time=1991] And you keep that baggage and you've walked with it for many, many years, what journey are you on?
[time=1996] What slide are you on even today as we come into this room?
[time=2000] You know, I want to say kudos.
[time=2002] If you've never attended the first service in the asylum across the road, you've got to try it.
[time=2008] We had some amazing acts of God.
[time=2009] Anyone here from the asylum that was first service this morning, anybody come over?
[time=2013] Okay, we had an incredible experience this morning of people standing up and just opening up about their morning slides.
[time=2021] Transparency, I love it.
[time=2022] I love transparency.
[time=2023] I love being real.
[time=2025] Again, one life to live, let's live it now.
[time=2026] Let's live it on purpose.
[time=2028] And so I was just so taken back by the honesty of that group over there.
[time=2032] But the reality is we are all on a journey and some of you are on some deep dark slides right now.
[time=2038] This economy's been hard.
[time=2040] This marriage of yours has been difficult.
[time=2045] Your teenage son or daughter has decided no more churchy for me.
[time=2049] No more faith for me.
[time=2052] They've given up.
[time=2053] Maybe you have that illness.
[time=2055] Maybe you're dealing with that cancer.
[time=2058] Maybe you've been to a funeral lately and had to say goodbye.
[time=2060] One person across the way had someone murdered recently in their life.
[time=2065] Devastating.
[time=2066] Whatever it is, I believe that a lot of us are on that journey.
[time=2070] And if we're not on the journey today, I will tell you with some confidence that you'll be on some kind of a morning slide at some point in your future, maybe even as early as tomorrow.
[time=2078] It's not something I wish upon you, but that is the reality of the life that we live.
[time=2083] What challenge have you found yourself in where God wants you to lean into Him rather than lean into self?
[time=2093] The morning slide is simply this, that you and I are on a journey.
[time=2098] And we can ride that slide to the very bottom
[time=2107] and find our Creator, God, waiting for us.
[time=2111] Or we can try and do what we do often in our daily lives, don't we, where we take kind of off ramps, escape routes.
[time=2120] Like me, when I was a young man, raised in an unchurched home, where I saw my father using alcohol, I tried early to do the same.
[time=2128] I started getting into drugs, I started getting into relationships, I tried at all, addictions of all sorts, all different off ramps of escapism, 'cause I didn't want to hurt, no one wants to hurt, no one likes that, no one says, bring on the pain, although we do live in a tattooed, purest generation, don't we, there might be something to that.
[time=2147] But no one really wants to be in pain, no one wants to mourn.
[time=2152] I want to introduce you to one of the most, I think greatest leaders of our Bible, and that is Nehemiah.
[time=2162] In the face of great struggle, he was a great leader.
[time=2166] And although we could spend the next 52 weeks in this book, we've got 16 more minutes.
[time=2173] He was a committed servant of God, but he was also a servant of God's enemy.
[time=2180] You see, he was a cup bearer to the king, and a cup bearer has a pretty ridiculous responsibility.
[time=2186] You see, whenever someone brings some drink or some food to the king, guess who gets to taste it for poison?
[time=2192] The cup bearer, it sounds like a pretty groovy job, but I wonder if you can find that a LinkedIn, you know?
[time=2198] Cup bearer.
[time=2199] And so Nehemiah had a pretty fantastic relationship with the king because the king really trusted Nehemiah for his very life.
[time=2207] It was a risky job that Nehemiah had.
[time=2210] And if we could spend the entire time this morning talking about Nehemiah, we'd get so many great lessons out of this book.
[time=2217] Here's a guy who really did an incredible, incredible thing because of obedient ear to God.
[time=2224] But he rode a morning slide.
[time=2227] I'm gonna jump into the text here in a little bit, but what happens at the beginning of Nehemiah is his brother comes to him.
[time=2233] He says, bro, you would not believe the city of Jerusalem.
[time=2238] It lies in ruin.
[time=2240] The walls have been torn down.
[time=2242] The houses are burned to the ground.
[time=2245] People are depressed or discouraged.
[time=2248] The beautiful city of Zion, Jerusalem is no more.
[time=2253] It's totally, totally devastated.
[time=2256] And we see in Nehemiah one, four, if you're following me in your Bible, I'm reading out of the cure Bible, of our remedy of Him, cure Bible, but it says in Nehemiah one, four.
[time=2267] When I heard this Nehemiah, I said, I sat down and cried.
[time=2271] Then for several days, I mourned.
[time=2276] I went without eating to show my sorrow and I prayed.
[time=2281] Now, if you have your Bible open to Nehemiah, join me as I read this prayer of Nehemiah.
[time=2286] Lord, God of heaven, you are great and fearsome.
[time=2292] And you faithfully keep your promises to everyone who loves you and obeys your commands.
[time=2298] I am your servant.
[time=2299] So please have mercy on me and answer the prayer that I might, that I make day and night for these people of Israel who serve you.
[time=2309] I, my family and the rest of your people have sinned.
[time=2313] By choosing to disobey you and the laws and teachings you gave to your servant Moses, please remember the promise you made to Moses.
[time=2322] You told them that if we were unfaithful, you would scatter us among four nations.
[time=2328] But you also said that no matter how far we were, we could turn to you and start obeying your laws.
[time=2337] And then you would bring us back to the place where you have chosen to be worshiped.
[time=2344] Our Lord, I am praying for your servants.
[time=2348] Those you rescued by your great strength and mighty power, please answer my prayer and the prayer of your other servants who gladly honor your name.
[time=2358] When I serve the king, his wine today, make him pleased with me and have him do what I ask.
[time=2372] Now, I know this is foolishness and I don't think, you know, I'd probably get arrested for it, but if I decided to catch a Greyhound today to Washington, D.C., and march up the steps of the White House and knock on that door and say, "President Obama, I got some plants." I'd like to see him stilled around here.
[time=2391] Probably shouldn't use my George Bush impression at that point, but it probably wouldn't go well for me.
[time=2399] But again, follow me in Nehemiah, too, because we see this crazy thing happen.
[time=2404] During the month of Masson in the 12th year that our Xerces was king, I served him his wine as I had done before.
[time=2412] But this was the first time I ever looked depressed.
[time=2417] And so the king said, "Why do you look so sad?
[time=2422] You're not sick.
[time=2424] Something must be bothering you.
[time=2429] Even though I was frightened, I answered, "Your Majesty, I hope you live forever.
[time=2435] I feel sad because the city where my ancestors are buried is in ruins, and its gates have been burned down." The king asked, "What do you want me to do?"
[time=2449] I prayed to the God who rules from heaven.
[time=2454] Now, this is an incredible story, incredible story.
[time=2458] A really historical event that occurred.
[time=2461] First of all, Nehemiah says to the king, "Well, first of all, King, I want some time off.
[time=2468] I need some time off.
[time=2470] Two or three, maybe six years." King says, "Cool, okay, all right.
[time=2476] I'll do that." And you know what, King?
[time=2481] There's been this law that you laid down that no one's allowed to mess with Jerusalem.
[time=2485] You kind of want that whole city to lie and ruin, but I want to go and I want to rebuild it.
[time=2490] I want to rebuild the wall.
[time=2492] So can you change the law of the land and allow me to go back to Jerusalem and do my work that my God has called me to do?
[time=2501] Sure, you can do that.
[time=2504] And then he says, "You know what, King?
[time=2507] There's a lot of people out there that want to harm me.
[time=2509] I got a lot of critics, a lot of enemies, people that don't like Jewish folks, people that don't believe in my God, people that want to see Jerusalem lay as kind of a rocky ruin, would just send a few Marines with me.
[time=2521] In fact, could you just kind of send a ton of Marines with me?
[time=2526] Okay, King says.
[time=2530] So he's got the time off.
[time=2532] He's gotten the law changed.
[time=2533] He's got a pretty strong military going with him, and you know what he's going to ask next?
[time=2537] King, I'm kind of tight right now.
[time=2543] We don't have a whole lot of moolah, could you?
[time=2545] Could you bankroll this sucker for me?
[time=2547] And he asked the King to pay for the whole project.
[time=2552] Let me see the King say yes.
[time=2554] Now again, we could spend 52 weeks in this book.
[time=2557] It's a fantastic book.
[time=2559] If you want to be encouraging your walk with God, I totally recommend Diving to Nehemiah for 10 or 12 years.
[time=2565] It'll change your life.
[time=2566] It's a great, great book.
[time=2567] But what we see in Nehemiah is a man who's choosing to ride the morning slide.
[time=2576] Now, if you're like me, maybe you've got some off ramps in your life.
[time=2582] You don't like riding that slide to the bottom because at the bottom, that hurts.
[time=2586] Slides, you know, when you're going down in your morning, you're struggling, that's a difficult, difficult season.
[time=2592] And I think you can think of a time right now in your life where you hate it going through it.
[time=2595] But if you agreed with me, if you were willing to be transparent, you'd say that's where you grew the most.
[time=2600] Hardest times of your life, that's where you grew the most.
[time=2603] Unless, of course, you took an escape off ramp, then you ended up with more baggage.
[time=2608] I don't know what your off ramp would be.
[time=2612] I think, you know, if you're going to be like me, it's probably a visit to Best Buy to get a 95-inch high-def television because you're bummed that you're hockey team lost or something.
[time=2624] Or maybe you're going through difficult time in your marriage and your off ramp is flirting with the girl at work.
[time=2630] Or maybe you're off ramp is that you're a smoker.
[time=2634] Talk to a young man in between services or hurt me, speak over there, get smoke on his breath.
[time=2639] I made him feel pretty uncomfortable, I guess.
[time=2643] He just, he needed smoke after the service.
[time=2646] He's his off ramp.
[time=2648] He doesn't want to ride this to the bottom.
[time=2650] And I know his personal story, it's a tough story.
[time=2654] You're off ramp could be going and buying new shoes.
[time=2658] It could be, like me, I like to have chips and dip at 11 o'clock at night.
[time=2663] Seriously, a lot of people overeat as they're off ramp.
[time=2667] Maybe you're off ramp is going out and getting some more ink.
[time=2671] Maybe you're off ramp is something I couldn't even begin to dream about, but you know what it is because you don't want to deal with the fact that your life is going through a challenge or a crisis right now.
[time=2682] And it could be a small little thing, it could be a big little thing.
[time=2685] I know some moms that dip into the sauce mid-afternoon because they just have such a hard time being apparent to their kids.
[time=2694] What is your off ramp today?
[time=2699] I'll tell you, challenges will bring you all kinds of different attacks.
[time=2708] But our attacks that we receive, as we know here at Blackhawk, because you guys are such a biblically minded church, I know Kelly really gets you in the word, that our attacks that we receive are not flesh and blood attacks, are they?
[time=2721] What does Ephesians 6 say?
[time=2723] Do you guys know this text?
[time=2724] Ephesians 6 says, of course, that our battle is not against human beings.
[time=2730] We're fighting against forces and authorities and against rulers of darkness and powers in the spiritual world every day.
[time=2738] Now you might say, okay, you kind of lost me there.
[time=2740] You had me with the whole morning thing, but now this whole hocus pocus stuff?
[time=2744] Not there with you.
[time=2746] Let me back up.
[time=2748] I mentioned the wooden park.
[time=2749] I take my girls there all the time, and they love going there.
[time=2752] They crawl on everything and fall off things.
[time=2754] It's really fun for them.
[time=2756] But there's this one slide that they love going up on, and because I'm in, you know, broadcasting, I like to commentate.
[time=2762] I guess I always wanted to be a hockey commentator.
[time=2764] I don't know.
[time=2765] And I'll commentate for them and get them all excited about being here and going up the slide, and they get really excited about it.
[time=2770] They go up the slide, and they just love it when pop a commentate.
[time=2773] And so they ride the slide down, and they'll do all kinds of crazy tricks.
[time=2776] They'll put their hands up, they'll close their eyes, you know, they'll go on their belly.
[time=2779] They love it even more when pop is at the bottom of the slide.
[time=2785] With my arms out.
[time=2789] Because then they can close their eyes.
[time=2790] Then they can trust.
[time=2792] It's going to be okay because daddy's down there.
[time=2796] And so they ride that slide, and they are just -- they are content.
[time=2800] Because their pop is going to catch them at the bottom.
[time=2806] We are under attack every day, folks.
[time=2808] And yes, it might be your employer.
[time=2809] Yes, it might be your ex-wife.
[time=2810] Yes, it might be your child.
[time=2812] Yes, it might be your neighbor.
[time=2813] Yes, it might even be yourself.
[time=2815] It might be an addiction.
[time=2816] It might be something.
[time=2817] But I'll tell you what, that is not where our real battle is.
[time=2821] Our battle is a spiritual battle.
[time=2824] You know, I think about this like a fire.
[time=2826] Have you ever had a fire in your backyard?
[time=2828] You know, you get this wood together.
[time=2829] You burn the fire.
[time=2830] And there's these byproducts of the fire.
[time=2832] Smoke and heat, and there's probably others.
[time=2834] You know, I often talk to people at Remedy FM.
[time=2837] We talk to so many kids.
[time=2838] I'm talking thousands, tens of thousands of kids a year.
[time=2841] And they're really vulnerable with us right away.
[time=2843] How are you doing turns into -- I had an abortion yesterday.
[time=2846] How are you doing turns into gramodata cancer last night?
[time=2850] How are you doing turns into -- I'm plagued by addiction.
[time=2855] And so these kids are so honest with us immediately at Remedy FM that we hear all kinds of things.
[time=2861] But they always want to cut out the byproduct.
[time=2864] Well, if I could just stop looking at porn.
[time=2866] If I could just stop using drugs.
[time=2867] If I could just stop, you know, being this or doing that.
[time=2871] That's not the problem.
[time=2874] What's going on in the fire?
[time=2879] What's going on in the real deal, the source?
[time=2881] What's going on there?
[time=2882] What's going on that's taking you on this morning slide and causing you to deeply go into yourself?
[time=2887] Were you so desperately want to escape?
[time=2890] You want to jump off that slide halfway through?
[time=2892] You know how that works, right?
[time=2893] You jump off the slide and you're hurting yourself.
[time=2896] And so many people every day in our culture, especially here in North America, there's no shortage of distractions of things that we can do to escape.
[time=2904] We can escape our off ramps in every way, shape, and form.
[time=2907] Again, I can't listen to them all.
[time=2909] What is yours?
[time=2911] Got a new boat?
[time=2913] My marriage stinks, I'll buy a new boat.
[time=2918] Work 90 hours a week because you can't stand to go home to your spouse.
[time=2924] Stop talking to your child because they're not listening anyway.
[time=2930] Start addressing a little bit more provocatively.
[time=2933] Is that your off ramp?
[time=2934] What is your off ramp?
[time=2936] Because I want to tell you that your daddy wants you to ride the slide to the very bottom.
[time=2946] Christianity is such an oxymoron.
[time=2949] I tell you if the dude who helped me pray the prayer when I was 18, if I could get my hands on him.
[time=2956] It's such a paradox, isn't it?
[time=2958] If you want to live, you must die.
[time=2962] If you want to be first, you got to be last.
[time=2966] It's so crazy.
[time=2969] And yet our daddy says the only way you can get through this hardship is to be broken.
[time=2976] We don't like that.
[time=2978] We want to touch the screen for healing.
[time=2981] We want our wallets to fill up with money.
[time=2985] We want our key to turn into a Ferrari.
[time=2988] We don't like hardship.
[time=2989] We don't like struggle.
[time=2990] We don't like it tough.
[time=2991] Read your book.
[time=2992] It's called The Book of Acts.
[time=2994] I didn't see anybody doing a pyramid scheme there that made the millions.
[time=2999] Hardship.
[time=3000] Our daddy says ride that slide.
[time=3002] And Nehemiah had an ear to that daddy.
[time=3005] And that daddy took him and helped him rebuild a city.
[time=3009] Two mile long wall.
[time=3011] Twenty feet high in some places.
[time=3014] Four feet thick in some places.
[time=3016] And it was done.
[time=3018] Nearly 100% participation because Nehemiah heard the voice of God.
[time=3023] What is he saying to you today?
[time=3026] What's your morning slide right now?
[time=3028] What is your challenge?
[time=3031] What is it that you're going through?
[time=3034] Because Nehemiah provides a great example of believing big, hairy, audacious things.
[time=3042] Go to the king.
[time=3044] Ask him for everything.
[time=3047] And watch your daddy provide what you need to get through this.
[time=3052] I appreciated Corbin's exercise earlier.
[time=3054] I'm assuming you've been doing a lot of that lately this summer.
[time=3056] But that was so good.
[time=3058] Because the reality is we are finding ourselves in more and more deserts in our society.
[time=3063] Financially, marriages are failing almost two to one now.
[time=3067] It's very sad.
[time=3069] Addictions are rampant.
[time=3070] The internet has caused so much pain to so many people.
[time=3074] That's why we feel we have to be missionaries to this place and get kids and get people talking about life issues so we can give them the cure, God's Word as a solution, the remedy
[time=3084] Jesus Christ.
[time=3087] But what is your situation here today?
[time=3092] You know Matthew 5 says it best, blessed are those who what, who mourn, who lean into
[time=3099] their morning and say, Daddy, I'm getting clarity here.
[time=3105] I don't like it.
[time=3108] I don't like it that I don't like myself.
[time=3111] I don't like it that I can't remember why I married this person.
[time=3115] I don't like it that I want to do my Xbox 360 more than I want to read my devotional booklet.
[time=3121] I don't like it that I'd rather be escaping from this moment.
[time=3125] I want to be numb.
[time=3126] I don't want to feel this anymore.
[time=3127] I don't like all that stuff.
[time=3129] I don't like that I've carried this baggage for so many years.
[time=3131] I don't like all the voices I hear in my head.
[time=3134] I don't like that, Daddy.
[time=3135] I don't want to hear that stuff anymore.
[time=3137] And Daddy says, just keep riding the slide.
[time=3139] I got some plans for it at the bottom.
[time=3141] I got my arms wide open.
[time=3143] I want to be there to grab you and to hold you and show you what it means to rebuild the walls in your life, to rebuild the beautiful city of your life, to show you what it really
[time=3155] means to live on purpose, to put your flag in the sand and I am going to charge ahead.
[time=3161] I'm going to believe things that are more difficult to believe than anything I believe before, but I'm going to stand on this supernatural God and believe supernatural things and be part of supernatural activity because I believe in a God who is not by any means second to
[time=3177] anything on this earth.
[time=3180] He is the creator of all things.
[time=3182] Praise God.
[time=3183] I will walk ahead and I will ride this slide to the bottom.
[time=3188] And I will not try to escape off to a place that is secondary to what God wants from me.
[time=3205] Will you ride the slide today?
[time=3208] The first service I was able to get down the crowd and ask some questions and get to know
[time=3215] some of the peeps.
[time=3216] I don't want to make anyone nervous.
[time=3218] I'm not going to do that.
[time=3221] But will you ride the slide?
[time=3223] It's your slide.
[time=3227] God is not going to make you stay on that slide, but if you get off the slide and do your own thing, Romans chapter 1 says, "He gives us over to our sinful desires to do what
[time=3236] ought not to be done," Daddy doesn't want that for you.
[time=3244] Or will you ride an off-ramp of escape?
[time=3248] Let's stand together in closing.
[time=3251] I'm a Canadian that makes me a little weird, be honest.
[time=3261] I pray a little differently than a lot of folks.
[time=3264] I anticipate God to move, and He's moved here today.
[time=3267] I can tell.
[time=3268] I want you to put your hands out like this as if to cup up what God wants to pour out on your life right now.
[time=3275] If you feel comfortable, I'd like you to raise your hands so that He can shower Himself down upon you.
[time=3279] I'm going to pray Scripture over you right now trusting that God can do a way better job of speaking to you than I can.
[time=3287] He has this to say.
[time=3291] What can we say about all this?
[time=3295] If God is on our side, can anyone be against us?
[time=3300] God did not keep back His own Son, but He gave Him for us.
[time=3302] If God did this, won't He freely give us everything else?
[time=3308] If God says His chosen ones are acceptable to Him, can anyone bring charges against them?
[time=3313] Or can anyone condemn them?
[time=3315] No indeed.
[time=3318] Christ died and was raised to life, and now He is at God's right side, speaking to Him for us.
[time=3326] Can anything separate us from the love of Christ?
[time=3330] Can trouble suffering in hard times or hunger and nakedness or danger and death?
[time=3338] It is exactly as the Scriptures say, "For you we face death all day long, Lord.
[time=3343] We are like sheep on their way to be butchered, to save kids in cars that have driven off
[time=3351] the road.
[time=3353] In everything we have won more than a victory because of Christ who loves us, I am sure
[time=3360] that nothing can separate us from God's love, not life, or death, nor angels, or spirits,
[time=3369] not the present or the future, and that powers above or powers below, nothing in all creation
[time=3377] can separate us from God's love for us in Christ Jesus, our Lord, amen?
[time=3385] And Father, as we leave here, I pray in the name of the risen one who defeats those off
[time=3394] ramps.
[time=3397] God, I pray in the name of the risen one who allows us to see that brokenness is the key
[time=3408] to wholeness.
[time=3410] I pray in the name of the risen one that as we go down this slide, Lord Jesus, as the man in this room who is on the verge of bankrupts, he goes down this slide that he will find
[time=3421] himself rich at the bottom.
[time=3424] I pray for the young lady in this room who suffers with an eating disorder and struggles every day to feed herself that as she rides this slide to the bottom, she will learn with each inch down that slide that she is a princess of the most high king.
[time=3440] I pray for the marriage in this room, that even in this very place this morning, it's a miracle that they're here, but you have set up the appointment that they would hear today that it's time to ride the slide together to rebuild their marriage.
[time=3456] And Lord, I pray for the unspoken things that I don't know, but you do.
[time=3461] I pray for the young man who wants to go to college has no money and thinks he's going to be just like the other five generations of his family where they've gone nowhere fast.
[time=3470] I pray he'll stay on that slide.
[time=3472] I pray for everyone, Lord God, in our situations, trusting that you are the God that calls us
[time=3479] to be part of rebuilding the wall.
[time=3482] I pray this in Jesus' name because it has power, amen.
[time=3502] [AMEN]
[time=3532] of the Lord.
