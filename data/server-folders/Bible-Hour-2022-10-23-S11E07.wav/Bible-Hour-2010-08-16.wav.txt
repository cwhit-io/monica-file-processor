[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=33] It's great to have you with us and the Bible Hour is, as most of you know, not only an opportunity for us to share with you the gathering that takes place on a Sunday morning here at Black Hawk, but it's really a part of Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=51] As thankful as we are for the Bible Hour and the broadcast and the chance, it gives us to connect with people just like you.
[time=58] There are also other components to Black Hawk and one of those other arenas of ministry is Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=65] BCS has been a part of the Fort Wayne landscape for over 35, close to 40 years and the opportunity we get through Black Hawk Christian School, preschool all the way up through 12th grade, close to 800 kids and all their families.
[time=81] One of the great opportunities we have is to continue to equip and encourage the Word of God into the lives of not just Bible Hour audience viewers, but kids and young kids and teenage kids and young people who you know today need that kind of investment and their families.
[time=102] And so I wanna just remind you about Black Hawk Christian with August moving quickly and school just around the corner.
[time=110] Others of you maybe have even started.
[time=112] I wanna at least remind you of Black Hawk Christian, and the opportunity that you would have to better understand the education opportunity, the Christ-centered education opportunity that we offer to you and your friends and your family.
[time=126] I'm so thankful for the investment Black Hawk Christian has made in my family.
[time=130] And on the screen here, you can see some information about our school, a phone number, a website that you could go to.
[time=136] This year may not be the year for you, but as you think about your kids or as you have friends who are thinking about their kids in the future, I would want to just give my personal stamp of endorsement to our school.
[time=148] It is a phenomenal organization that's doing incredible things in the lives of young people.
[time=154] And I'd love for you to call, check it out, come get a tour.
[time=157] God's doing great things through BCS.
[time=160] Hey, thank you for tuning in this morning.
[time=162] We're so privileged to have this relationship with you.
[time=166] I hope you'll come and visit us soon.
[time=168] Thank you for all that you do for the Bible Hour.
[time=171] God bless you and have a great week.
[time=173] - Good morning, church.
[time=178] You would stand with me.
[time=180] We're gonna begin our time today with a song that helps us focus on what's true.
[time=186] And a song that helps us think about how desperately each and every one of us need God in our lives.
[time=192] Let's sing this together.
[time=193] [MUSIC - 229 seconds]
[time=427] God, this morning, we do want to lift our eyes to you.
[time=433] Think of the song that says, "I lift my eyes to the mountains.
[time=437] Where does my help come from?
[time=439] It comes from you, the maker of heaven, the maker of earth."
[time=445] So, God, we do that this morning.
[time=447] We also lift our eyes to Jesus, like Hebrew says.
[time=451] We fix our eyes on him, because Jesus, you are the author of our faith and the perfecter of our faith.
[time=459] We thank you for being both the designer of our lives and our faith and the one who carries that faith onto completion for us, Jesus.
[time=468] Ask your blessing on this time today, Lord, that you would empower us to feel your presence and to know you more and to get the strength and the hope and the courage that we need to face whatever the rest of this day holds, whatever tomorrow holds, whatever this week holds.
[time=485] Would you meet us here today, God?
[time=488] We ask it in Jesus' name.
[time=491] [AMEN] O, for a thousand tongues to see, my great redeemer's praise, the glories of my God and King, the triumphs of his grace.
[time=514] My gracious master and my God,
[time=521] assist me to proclaim, to spread through all the earth abroad, the honors of my name.
[time=537] O, to praise the great God, would you sing of who you are, to proclaim your name above all other God.
[time=555] Breaks the power of sin.
[time=562] He sex the prisoner.
[time=566] Sing it out.
[time=567] O, to praise the great God, would you sing of who you are, to proclaim your name above all other God.
[time=596] O, to praise the great God,
[time=603] would you sing of who you are, to proclaim your name above all other God.
[time=618] O, for a thousand tongues to sing, the great redeemer's grace, the glories of my God and King, the triumphs of his grace.
[time=639] O, to praise the great God, would you sing of who you are, to proclaim your name above all other God.
[time=657] O, to praise the great God,
[time=664] would you sing of who you are, to proclaim your name above all other God.
[time=677] O, to praise the great God, would you sing of who you are, to proclaim your name above all other God.
[time=722] O, to praise the great God, would you sing of who you are,
[time=734] to proclaim your name above all other God.
[time=741] Would you praise me as we begin this morning?
[time=746] O, for a thousand tongues to sing, my great redeemer's grace, the glories of my God and King, the triumphs of his grace, my gracious master, and my God assist me this morning to proclaim.
[time=771] Desprised through all the earth abroad and in this place, the honors of your name.
[time=776] I pray this, we all pray this together in Jesus' name.
[time=779] [AMEN] Good morning, everyone.
[time=784] I'm here for the prayer service first hour.
[time=787] I hope that when we do that again, that it is a when, not an if, that you can make your way out, you will not regret it, I promise.
[time=797] My friend Jesus is upstairs.
[time=799] I can't see him.
[time=800] There he is.
[time=801] Jesus, what is the Spanish word for hope?
[time=804] Espédansa.
[time=806] Isn't that a wonderful word?
[time=807] I love saying it.
[time=808] I love what it means.
[time=809] I love what it sounds like.
[time=811] That was the takeaway for me this morning from the prayer service
[time=817] that you can have hope.
[time=820] Whatever you're facing today, I pray that this message today, we're going to talk about Mary today, but Mary is really just an excuse to talk about what God has done through her in his word.
[time=833] If you have your Bibles this morning, I want to just read something real quickly to you that God encouraged me with from the prayer service.
[time=840] This is one verse.
[time=841] It's Psalm 71 verse 5.
[time=843] This is bonus coverage.
[time=846] Psalm 71 verse 5.
[time=853] Hope.
[time=854] Espédansa.
[time=857] That's what prayer is.
[time=858] Prayer is a declaration.
[time=859] I have hope.
[time=860] I believe, God, that you are, who you say you are and that you're concerned about me and that you care about my life.
[time=869] [AMEN] My wife, Jody, and I prayed together.
[time=872] We had some time by ourselves in that first hour, and it was a sweet to declare his hope.
[time=880] Psalm 71 verse 5 says, "For you, O Lord, are my hope, my trust, O Lord, from my youth." That's a declaration.
[time=890] You, O Lord, are my hope.
[time=893] You are my trust from my youth.
[time=897] What a wonderful thing to just declare this morning, and if you would declare that verse together, would you please say amen with me?
[time=904] Okay.
[time=905] It's been a great summer.
[time=907] Summer is over for me, essentially.
[time=909] We're back to school on Thursday, and it's okay.
[time=912] I think it's okay.
[time=914] It's been a good summer.
[time=915] My sister was in Scotland, and she bought me this tie, and I'm wearing it this morning for her from Scotland.
[time=921] So joy when you're listening out there.
[time=924] This is for you.
[time=925] This tie.
[time=926] This wonderful tie from Scotland.
[time=928] We're going to be in Luke chapter 1 this morning talking about Mary.
[time=934] There's a lot to say about Mary, and we're going to be doing things.
[time=938] I'm a little early in the service today.
[time=940] We're going to break things up a little bit.
[time=941] I like doing that.
[time=942] Corbin, and I like to keep each other on our toes.
[time=945] We like doing such things.
[time=947] I ask you to stand with me as we read this, these 12 or 13 verses from Luke chapter 1, starting in Luke 1 verse 26 reading few verse 38.
[time=956] I'm reading from the English standard version, as I always do.
[time=960] Luke 1, 26.
[time=964] This is a familiar story to you, and I want to ask something difficult, but possible.
[time=971] Nothing will be impossible with God.
[time=974] Jesus says that, he's right.
[time=978] Could you put new ears on today and hear this story for the first time as if you're hearing
[time=984] it for the first time?
[time=985] Can you try?
[time=986] It's a great exercise.
[time=988] So pretend, we can be childlike this morning, pretend as though you've never heard this
[time=994] story before, and see what jumps out at you.
[time=997] In the sixth month, Angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,
[time=1003] to a virgin, betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David, and the
[time=1009] virgin's name was Mary, and he came to her and said, "Greetings.
[time=1013] Oh, favored one.
[time=1014] The Lord is with you." But she was greatly troubled at the saying and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be.
[time=1021] The angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God, and behold
[time=1027] you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.
[time=1033] He will be great, and will be called the son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end." Mary said to the angel, "How will this be since I am a virgin?"
[time=1052] And Angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High
[time=1058] will overshadow you, therefore the child to be born will be called Holy, the son of God,
[time=1064] and behold your relative Elizabeth, and her old age has also conceived a son, and this
[time=1070] is the six month with her who was called barren, for nothing will be impossible with God."
[time=1077] And Mary said, "Behold, I am the servant of the Lord.
[time=1081] Let it be to me according to your word, and the angel departed from her.
[time=1085] You may be seated." We're going to traffic through about 30 verses in Luke 1 this morning in three different parts.
[time=1093] The first part in your outline in your bulletin this morning is about Mary's son.
[time=1099] There is no one like him.
[time=1101] Mary's son.
[time=1102] It says in verse 26, "If you have your Bible still open, we'll be in verse 26." We're going to kind of work through this, finding out the answer to the question.
[time=1111] There's a bunch of questions in the notes for this morning that were impressed upon me having
[time=1117] done what we did just a few minutes ago.
[time=1119] Imagine having heard it for the first time.
[time=1121] These are questions that came out to me having read the passage with new eyes like I'd never read it before.
[time=1127] The first question I'd like to kind of be hovering over you for a little while, let her aid there in your outlines, is who is Jesus?
[time=1137] Who is Jesus?
[time=1138] I don't know if there's a more important question that you will ever be asked ever.
[time=1144] Your answer to that question is eternally significant.
[time=1148] So let's walk through and see.
[time=1151] It says in verse 26 that the angel Gabriel came to Mary in the sixth month, in sixth
[time=1157] month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, second trimester of her pregnancy.
[time=1162] She's already been to go visit Zacharias and this birth has been foretold and angels
[time=1168] are all over the place in Luke's gospel.
[time=1171] If you look at verse 26, you can see, but it's just a matter of fact, isn't it?
[time=1176] In the sixth month, there is an angel sent from God, doesn't try to explain it because you'll see there are angels, see, and there's a God and angels come from God.
[time=1185] There's none of that.
[time=1186] Angel came from God.
[time=1188] Luke, the Bible, friends, is profoundly supernatural, that there are things beyond this world at
[time=1196] work all the time, all the time.
[time=1199] If we are bound into the merely natural, if science becomes our God, then we are in big
[time=1207] trouble because much of what Luke says in this passage will be nonsense.
[time=1212] Because virgins, this is this little education, virgins don't have babies.
[time=1217] That's why Mary asks the question, I've never known a man, angel, thanks, it's not how it
[time=1227] works.
[time=1228] The supernatural is everywhere in Luke chapter 1, and that's the first observation I would make.
[time=1234] Turn your Bibles to Isaiah 9 verse 1, turn left in your Bibles if you would back there.
[time=1239] The angel comes to visit a city, and the city is a strong word, it's really a village,
[time=1246] in Galilee, named Nazareth.
[time=1251] This verse from Isaiah has always jumped out.
[time=1253] There are more familiar verses to you in this passage, it will come to you in just a minute.
[time=1256] Look at Isaiah 9 verse 1, Isaiah is prophesying to the people of Israel in a very troubled
[time=1263] time.
[time=1264] They're far from God, they're distracted, and here's what he says.
[time=1269] But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish.
[time=1273] In the former time, he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and naphthaly, the two tribes where Galilee was located in the northern part of Israel.
[time=1282] In the latter time, he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan,
[time=1289] Galilee of the nations, Galilee of the Gentiles is how that's translated.
[time=1294] Galilee is a nowhere place, it is a nowhere place, and the fact that he would come there is remarkable.
[time=1301] He would come to a nowhere place, to a nowhere person.
[time=1305] But look in verse 27, I also observed this with you, did you see that?
[time=1310] Mary and Joseph have names, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph.
[time=1318] Betrothed will work this way, you would go to the man would go to the wife's house anywhere
[time=1326] from 12 to 15 years old, the girl would usually be in that culture, we don't know how old Mary was, but she was in that middle school range.
[time=1334] And Joseph went to her parents' house and said, "I would like to marry your daughter." And they said, "Okay." And about a year's time would pass in between the betrothal and the actual marriage time.
[time=1343] So she was spoken for by Joseph, but not yet married, they weren't living together yet.
[time=1348] She would stay in her parents' house and he would stay at his house.
[time=1351] And after a year's time, there would be a ceremony and they would come and live together.
[time=1354] But not yet.
[time=1355] And so she's betrothed, she's engaged, but it's kind of engagement with an asterisk by it's more than engagement.
[time=1361] It's hard to explain.
[time=1365] He comes to a virgin, betrothed to a man, his name was Joseph, of the house of David.
[time=1369] If you're inclined to mark in your Bible, mark that phrase in verse 27 of the house of David, not insignificant.
[time=1375] And the virgin's name was Mary.
[time=1379] They have names.
[time=1380] God gave them names and we know them as people.
[time=1385] The Bible friends is filled up with dignity of people.
[time=1389] They have names.
[time=1390] They're people.
[time=1392] God loves, the guy uses to accomplish his purposes.
[time=1396] Kind of observe this with you.
[time=1397] God knows your name.
[time=1399] And you might think you're nobody from nowhere.
[time=1405] This passage speaks to all kinds of people.
[time=1406] If you think you're nobody from nowhere, God doesn't know my name, that doesn't even know I exist.
[time=1410] He does know you exist.
[time=1413] If you are a prideful person and you think God would be privileged to know you, this passage speaks to you too later on.
[time=1420] So everybody is in this passage, but I want to encourage you with those words.
[time=1424] If you think that God doesn't know your name, you're wrong.
[time=1427] He knows you.
[time=1428] He loves you.
[time=1430] He has provided for your salvation.
[time=1432] Mary says so later in the passage.
[time=1436] If you are a prideful person and you think that God, you're doing God a favor by showing up today, then he has something to say to you too.
[time=1445] All kinds of people on that continuum, verse 28.
[time=1453] By the way, the word virgin in verse 27 means virgin.
[time=1456] I just thought you should know.
[time=1458] Verse 28.
[time=1459] "And he came to her and said, 'Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you.'" Something like, "Dear Mary, it's a word you'd use in letters."
[time=1469] Dear Chris, God's been gracious to you.
[time=1473] That's why Mary freaks out the greeting, like, "I don't know what you're talking about.
[time=1476] I'm not nobody.
[time=1477] Why was she so troubled?" This says in verse 29 that she's greatly troubled.
[time=1483] It's the only place that words ever use in the whole New Testament.
[time=1486] It's literally guys like she's shaken.
[time=1489] "What's going on?
[time=1491] Why is she so bothered by it?" Because angels tend to freak people out in the Bible.
[time=1495] They tend to get people some pause, like what is going on.
[time=1500] Verse 28, I want to go back just for a minute, "O favored one, the Lord is with you."
[time=1506] I was thinking about this summer, we're not yet done with this series about reliable stories, but I'm looking back, and I think a great heading for this series would be from our hymn that we sang this morning.
[time=1516] Really over all this is the triumphs of his grace.
[time=1520] What has this series been about?
[time=1521] Zacchaeus is a little guy up in the tree, and Jesus comes to find him, the triumphs of his grace.
[time=1528] He's always living in a crooked and corrupt generation, and he finds favor with God, the grace of God.
[time=1533] Gideon's hiding out in a wine press, a very strange place to take care of wheat, but he's there, and God has grace.
[time=1541] He shows grace to him, and God shows grace to Mary.
[time=1545] That's what the Latin Vulgate translation says, "Mary is full of grace," so it translates that word, and it literally means something like that, "full of grace," something familiar.
[time=1556] God's full of grace.
[time=1557] The triumphs of his grace in Zacchaeus' life and Noah's life and Gideon's life and Mary's life all throughout it, maybe there's a story you could tell of the triumphs of his grace.
[time=1567] Is there?
[time=1569] Think about it.
[time=1571] Verse 30, "The angel said to Mary, 'Don't be afraid,' that's the most frequently given command in the Bible.
[time=1577] I've told you that before.
[time=1578] There it is again.
[time=1579] I'm making it up.
[time=1580] There it is.
[time=1581] Everywhere you go.
[time=1582] Don't be afraid.
[time=1584] For you have found favor with God, just like Gideon, just like Noah, just like Zacchaeus,
[time=1591] grace.
[time=1592] Verse 31, "And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear son, and you will call his name Jesus." When I was in college, I went to a Messianic Jewish church, and that was almost 20 years
[time=1603] ago, and I have never been to anything like it in my life.
[time=1606] You don't messianic Jewish churches.
[time=1608] It's a Jewish congregation that proclaims Yeshua as Messiah, Jesus.
[time=1613] I have never seen people worship like that before.
[time=1616] I've never seen anything like it before.
[time=1618] It was overwhelming.
[time=1620] The pastor came out in his Yomukkah, and he preached to someone from 2 Timothy.
[time=1626] It was overwhelming.
[time=1628] And they sang praises.
[time=1629] You know how we sing Jewish songs, and we sound like non-Jewish people doing Jewish songs?
[time=1635] They were putting on that, that, that, that.
[time=1636] They were doing it for real.
[time=1639] And it was beautiful.
[time=1640] It was absolutely beautiful.
[time=1643] His name is Yeshua.
[time=1646] And it means, it's the same name as Joshua, really, from the Old Testament.
[time=1651] It means Yahweh salvation.
[time=1655] You alone can rescue.
[time=1658] You alone can save.
[time=1662] That's why we sing.
[time=1664] That's why Mary has this reaction.
[time=1667] He will save, Matthew says, "You will call his name Jesus for he will save his people from their sins." That's why the name Jesus.
[time=1674] That's why this name matters.
[time=1676] Names matter.
[time=1677] Tried to give our kids names that mattered.
[time=1681] Hannah's name means God is gracious.
[time=1684] Christian's name means Christian.
[time=1688] Means what it says.
[time=1689] Christ's follower.
[time=1690] We're praying that over him.
[time=1691] In the prayer service this morning, somebody said they were thankful that for the salvation of their children.
[time=1698] And we're praying that earnestly for Hannah and for Christian.
[time=1702] Verse 32 and 33, "The question who is Jesus' friends is answered by the angel in five powerful
[time=1709] ways.
[time=1710] And it won't be on the screen, but you can follow through with me.
[time=1712] It says in verse 32, "He will be great." John the Baptist was going to be great in the Lord's sight.
[time=1717] Go back to Luke chapter 1 and verse 15, so he'll be great before the Lord.
[time=1724] Well, he'll deduce to this be great, he has unqualified greatness, he'll be great.
[time=1731] That's one.
[time=1732] Son of the Most High, he's the one who's going to get David's throne.
[time=1736] He will reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end.
[time=1741] Everybody has term limits.
[time=1744] Every king has a term, they'll die and they will be king anymore.
[time=1747] His kingdom has no end, and he shall reign forever and ever.
[time=1754] Isn't that beautiful?
[time=1756] It's true.
[time=1758] God gives thrones.
[time=1762] God gives thrones to whoever he sees fit to give them to.
[time=1765] May we trust him in that today.
[time=1767] I want to read you two scriptures that answer this question about who is Jesus in a profound way.
[time=1772] John Dunne was a middle ages pastor and he described Mary's pregnancy with Jesus as
[time=1781] immensity coistered in her womb.
[time=1784] Isn't that amazing?
[time=1788] Immensity coistered in thy womb, he said.
[time=1793] That's what Colossians 1 says.
[time=1796] Colossians 1 15, he is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, for by him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, thrones or
[time=1806] dominions or rulers or authorities.
[time=1809] All things were created by him and for him.
[time=1814] He is before all things and him all things hold together and he is the head of the by the church.
[time=1819] He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent.
[time=1823] He might have first place.
[time=1826] Hebrews 1 says long ago at many times and in many ways God spoke to our fathers, but by the prophets.
[time=1831] But in these last days, we've been in the last days for 2000 years, according to the author of Hebrews.
[time=1837] So we are in the last days.
[time=1838] We have been for quite some time.
[time=1841] He has spoken to us by his son who he appointed air of all things through whom also he created the world.
[time=1846] He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint, it's a word that you would
[time=1852] use for a ring, just as a sign, the exact imprint of his nature and he upholds the universe
[time=1858] by the word of his power.
[time=1859] Jesus upholds the universe by the word of his power.
[time=1863] What does your answer to that question look like?
[time=1865] Who is Jesus?
[time=1866] What's it look like?
[time=1867] Does it look like the Bible's answer?
[time=1869] It's a fair question for each one of us.
[time=1876] Verse 34, Mary is troubled because she is a virgin and virgins don't have babies.
[time=1880] The angel's answer is the Holy Spirit.
[time=1883] That's the first part of the angel's answer to Mary is the Holy Spirit.
[time=1888] Francis Chan just came out with a book recently called Forgotten God and he might have an image of the cover on the screens, I don't know, but his name is Francis Chan, C-H-A-N, the name of the book is Forgotten God.
[time=1900] The book is about reversing our tragic neglect of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1906] Luke does not have this problem.
[time=1909] Luke doesn't have a neglect of the Holy Spirit going on in his gospel, he's everywhere.
[time=1912] The book of Acts, the second part of Luke's gospel, the Holy Spirit is everywhere in the book of Acts.
[time=1918] It's really the acts of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1921] He's driving everything.
[time=1923] By the way, if you've ever wondered about the Trinity and how that works, how that looks,
[time=1929] how is it we believe in one God but three persons, this is a great place to go.
[time=1933] Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all at work in this passage and whether or not it works anywhere else.
[time=1938] The word Trinity isn't in the Bible anywhere but it's taught very clearly in a place like this.
[time=1944] I just encourage you with that.
[time=1949] The Holy Spirit will overshadow Mary and he'll be God's son, God's own son.
[time=1956] Elizabeth in verse 36, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son and
[time=1963] this is the sixth month with her who, I love this, was called Baron.
[time=1967] I don't need more.
[time=1970] Would you read verse 37 with me out loud, I'm going to read it a couple of times out loud,
[time=1976] it's a declaration from this angel over us, it's also in your outline.
[time=1983] For nothing will be impossible with God, say it with me.
[time=1985] For nothing will be impossible with God.
[time=1989] One more time.
[time=1990] For nothing will be impossible with God.
[time=1994] What do you consider to be impossible?
[time=1998] I'll never find a job.
[time=2002] My children will never get their act together, they will never come to know Christ.
[time=2008] If you're wondering about that you can come talk to me after the service about your children coming to know Christ.
[time=2012] Wonderful news this past week about that.
[time=2016] Your marriage is just never going to work God, it's never going to work, we've been at it for so long, it's never going to be better.
[time=2025] Nothing will be impossible with God.
[time=2028] You want the Greek word for nothing here, there is, nothing.
[time=2033] Nothing will be impossible with God, that's pretty thorough.
[time=2037] Please be encouraged by those words, if virgins can have babies, nothing is impossible with
[time=2043] God and they do.
[time=2046] And she did, metal in the angle, said this, it's a little four line stanza.
[time=2054] This is the irrational season where love brooms bright and wild had Mary been filled with reason, there had been no room for the child.
[time=2065] After all this, Mary goes to visit Elizabeth.
[time=2068] So the second part of the outline is Mary's stay.
[time=2070] The second question in her outline letter B there was what is impossible with God.
[time=2075] I want you to consider that question this week as you think about it.
[time=2079] There goes in haste, it says in verse 39 to visit Elizabeth, Mary's stay in your outline,
[time=2086] her visit with Elizabeth.
[time=2089] What gives you joy is the first question on the outline, what gives you joy.
[time=2098] There's so much to say here.
[time=2101] It says in Luke chapter 1 in verse 41 that Elizabeth is filled with the Holy Spirit.
[time=2110] Her son, it says earlier, this has blown my mind for years and I'll revisit with you this morning for a minute.
[time=2118] The angel said to Zacharias to Elizabeth's husband in Luke chapter 1 verse 15, he will
[time=2126] be great but for the Lord, he must not drink wine or strong drink and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb.
[time=2135] That could mean two different things.
[time=2136] It could mean either that he was filled with the Holy Spirit while he was in there or that at the moment of his birth, it happens, either way it's amazing because John didn't do anything to make it happen.
[time=2145] God just was with him in that way.
[time=2149] Now Mary has been told the Holy Spirit will overshadow you and the power of the Most High will come over you and it's almost like the Holy Spirit within John recognizes the Holy
[time=2159] Spirit in Mary and responds with joy.
[time=2163] Now watch this, she's two months along in her, she's two trimesters along in her pregnancy and she says that there's a baby within her.
[time=2172] I observe that with you and the baby is capable of joy.
[time=2181] God gives personhood even to unborn children.
[time=2187] What gives you joy?
[time=2189] What gave John joy was Jesus and Elizabeth calls Mary the mother of her Lord.
[time=2203] Why is it giving to me?
[time=2205] How could this happen?
[time=2206] How could the mother of my Lord come to see me?
[time=2211] The last thing she says in that exchange is that blessed is she who believed that there
[time=2223] would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.
[time=2228] Do you believe what God has said, let her be in your outline, do you believe him?
[time=2235] Do you believe that what he said is going to come to pass?
[time=2243] God took Abraham outside in Genesis 15 and said look at the stars, Abraham, he was going
[time=2249] to be like your kid and he was an old man that had no kids.
[time=2253] He was worried about his promise being kept, God's promise being kept to him.
[time=2261] Look toward heaven and number the stars, Genesis 15, verse 5, if you're able to number them, he said to him, so shall your offspring be, and he believed the Lord.
[time=2272] He believed and he counted it to him as righteousness.
[time=2278] Isaiah 28, 16 says the one who believes God and he'd never be shaken, he'll never have to hurry, won't be in haste, won't be nervous is the point.
[time=2292] I wanted to allow someone to sing Mary's song for you, so the third part of our, the second
[time=2298] part of our talk to you was about Mary's stay with Elizabeth, the third part will be about
[time=2304] Mary's song and I can't wait for you to hear this song, Mary's song of praise, it's called the Magnificat because in the Latin, that's the first word, my soul magnifies the Lord.
[time=2315] So allow us to teach that song to you and then we'll come back and talk about it just
[time=2321] for a minute, the Magnificat.
[time=2339] [MUSIC]
[time=2366] My soul magnifies the Lord, my spirit rejoices in my Savior, he's seen the humble state of
[time=2382] my heart, and now all will call me blessed, he's the almighty God, he's done great things
[time=2402] holy is his name, his mercy is free, for those who fear his justice, and made
[time=2417] his turn to generation lucky proclaim his fame, he has shown the strength of his hands
[time=2443] brought down the mighty from their pretense, he's scattered the pride in their hearts,
[time=2459] lifted the lonely to meet him, praise the almighty God, he's done great things for us,
[time=2475] he is his name, his mercy is free, for those who fear his justice, and made
[time=2490] his turn to generation lucky proclaim his fame, proclaim his fame,
[time=2508] he has been the hungry of your needs, and the rich he sent him to your way,
[time=2537] he has remembered his reign, and he will ring now with him always, always, always,
[time=2558] he's the almighty God, he's done great things for us, holy is his name, his mercy is
[time=2575] free, for those who fear his justice, and made his turn to generation proclaim his
[time=2586] fame, he's the almighty God, he's done great things for us, holy is his name, his mercy
[time=2601] is free, for those who fear his justice, and made his turn to generation lucky proclaim
[time=2616] his fame, he's the almighty God, he's done great things for us, holy is his fame,
[time=2646] I thought about the fact that we would sing that song together this morning, and that
[time=2656] Jamie would teach it to us by singing it, but I think we are already saying it earlier today when we are saying you alone can rescue, it's the same song, I was talking to Abby
[time=2667] Starr earlier this week, Abby was in the video about Blackout Christian School, and I think Abby, as one who is employed by the school, I will tell you, if you want to pay double, I think nothing is stopping you from doing that, Abby, are you here today?
[time=2680] If you'd like to pay double, Abby, you're welcome to do so, but I was talking to Abby about this children's Bible that we found called the Jesus storybook Bible, would you
[time=2690] write that down if you have kids, if you don't have kids, if you like the Bible?
[time=2695] Jesus storybook Bible, it is a treasure, every story winds its way back to Jesus, remember
[time=2704] a couple of weeks ago when the kids went through all the books of the Bible, wasn't that profound, to what this storybook Bible does, it's a theologically informed children's Bible called the Jesus storybook Bible, I think Abby is going to buy 20 of them, we
[time=2719] talked about it, I encourage you with it, it talks about Jesus as the rescuer, the one
[time=2725] who would come and bring rescue all over the place and isn't that what Mary's song describes,
[time=2733] the one who's come to rescue, it's almost like Mary goes to visit Elizabeth's friends and her being with Elizabeth creates in her a realization of what the angels already said,
[time=2746] it's as though everything is going to be different, earlier in Luke's Gospel, excuse me, later
[time=2752] on Zacharias will also break into singing in Luke 179 and he calls Jesus the sunrise from
[time=2760] on high, the dawn of the morning, so it's as if everything before him was as if it was
[time=2767] darkness and everything after him will be the light, and Mary understands that's what her son will be, the light, the rescuer, sometimes the company of a friend brings what God has
[time=2780] said and done into clear light, doesn't it?
[time=2784] We need each other, it's fashionable today, friends, it's fashionable today to love Jesus
[time=2792] but to disrespect his bride, and as a husband I don't wouldn't like that very much, if you
[time=2798] like me but you disrespected my wife, I wouldn't like that very much, we need to be together,
[time=2806] we need to be together as the church, and I know that the church is not a perfect institution
[time=2813] but it was Jesus's idea, he founded it and we need each other in this place, so please
[time=2820] come, please encourage those in your life, whoever they are in your life, to be a member
[time=2827] of a local congregation, to gather and to assemble, we need each other desperately, I had a friend
[time=2836] years ago that talked about his experience with people who come at this story differently
[time=2842] and he said that they understand it as though Jesus is mad at me because of my sin, which
[time=2849] is appropriate, he paid a heavy price for my sin, he's upset, God is upset by my sin,
[time=2855] who better to talk to about my sin than his mom, because his mom has his ear, and a lot
[time=2863] about that friends make sense to me, how somebody could think that, if they weren't grounded in what God has said other places, that Mary has the mother of Jesus, Mary has the ear
[time=2875] of Jesus because she's his mom, Mary understands who she is in this song, doesn't she, look
[time=2884] at what she says, my soul magnifies the Lord, my spirit rejoices in God, my, Mary needs
[time=2894] a Savior, just like me, just like you, he has looked on the humble estate of his servant,
[time=2904] a servant is one who gives up all rights of themselves, I am your servant, so Paul describes himself all over the detachment, the bond-servant of Jesus, serving him, how would you describe
[time=2916] yourself as letter A in the outline, how would you describe yourself, some Mary describes herself, a humble servant, one in need of a Savior, one whose soul makes much of God,
[time=2933] are you too proud, C.S. Lewis writes Marvellously on pride, and he says really, it's a very
[time=2941] prideful person that would admit they weren't proud, we all struggle with that in some ways,
[time=2947] Psalm 138 verse 6 says, let this just wash over you, for though the Lord is high, he
[time=2956] regards the lowly, but the haughty, the arrogant, the prideful he knows from afar, the new
[time=2964] living translation says that he keeps his distance from them, the focus of Mary's song,
[time=2973] just read this with me, just let this resonate with you, look at all these pronouns, from now on verse 48, all generations will call me blessed, and what's the first word friends
[time=2984] of verse 49? What's the first word of verse 49? 4, you know what the word 4 is? Because,
[time=2993] why will all generations call me blessed? Because of this, watch. He who is mighty has
[time=3000] done great things for me, holy is his name, his mercy is for those who fear him from generation
[time=3007] to generation, he has shown strength with his arm, he's scattered the proud within the thoughts of their hearts, he has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate, he's filled the hungry, the rich he sent away empty, he's helped Israel,
[time=3023] who is the focus of Mary's song? The Lord is the focus of Mary's song, who is the focus
[time=3030] of your song, what do you talk about with your friends, with your coworkers on the internet,
[time=3037] on the phone, or wherever else you find, wherever else you network, what do you talk about? Talk about yourself, about other people, Mary's focus, Mary's concentration is on her son,
[time=3053] and on the one whom her son comes to make known. I invite you to think about that this
[time=3060] week, the focus of your conversation, your song, your plans that you're making. Did you
[time=3066] come before that? Is he informing all of that? The last question I asked you this morning,
[time=3075] let her be there, is how do you see the world? Mary understands the implications of her son's birth, she understands, his appearing will change everything. I want to read you a couple
[time=3088] of verses and then we're going to consider God as our savior in the elements, a very appropriate thing to do, to remember, Psalm 107 verse 40. This is how God sees the world.
[time=3104] We see the world as working our way up the chain, you know, I'll get what I can, sometimes
[time=3110] we see it that way and are less pleasant, not everyone sees it that way. He pours contempt
[time=3116] on princes and he makes them wander in trackless wastes, but he raises up the needy out of
[time=3123] affliction and makes their families like flocks. James 4, 10 says, humble yourselves before
[time=3131] the Lord and he will exalt you. Lots of observations to make from Mary's song before I step down.
[time=3138] I'll observe this. God is with the poor and the rich alike. Our efforts on behalf of the
[time=3148] poor friends in this place, building wells, mosquito nets, barrels of things to keep surgical
[time=3162] equipment from being infected is a good thing because God is with the poor. This song is
[time=3171] not about God is like wealthy people and God likes, it's not what this song is about at all. It's been used that way before by people and it's just not right. But it is a turning upside down the way that we see the world. The way that God sees the world is not the way that we see the world. I invite you to see the world the way God does. I invite you this morning to consider Mary's son, to consider what happened in Mary's stay and
[time=3195] all that excited in her. I invite you also today to consider Mary's song. What she sang
[time=3201] about, what she thought about, what she wanted us to know, Corbin's coming now to walk us
[time=3207] through the remainder of our service. I would pray that all of these things that we've talked
[time=3213] about today would be on your minds, those questions. Keep them before you, maybe as you're praying and look at those scriptures on the outline that we didn't get to this morning. As you have time to be prayerfully considering what God has done, may those verses be in encouragement to you today. Steve said a little bit ago that nothing's impossible
[time=3231] with God. And we get to observe God today as Savior in the taking of the elements. And
[time=3239] I want you to think through this next song about the impossibility of someone like me
[time=3245] and someone like you, totally immersed in sin and acquainted with iniquity, being justified
[time=3254] and made right, and made righteous in the person and work of Jesus. When that baby Steve's been
[time=3262] preaching about this morning grew up, he took our infirmities on his shoulders and he bore him and he was beaten on a cross. So we're going to remember that together. First we're
[time=3274] going to sing a song about how nothing is impossible with him, even the impossibility
[time=3280] of calling sinners saints.
[time=3288] Oh no Ted, no valley, no gate, or else we know, could keep us from your love.
[time=3310] No sickness, no secret, no chain is strong enough to keep us from your love.
[time=3330] No man, no man, no man, no man, no man, no man, no man.
[time=3349] No man, no man, no man, no man, no man.
[time=3377] No man, no man, no man, no man, no man, no man, no man, no man.
[time=3402] No man, no man, no man.
[time=3418] The feeling is in your hands, God is, how strong, never breaks, I stand.
[time=3441] The feeling is in your hands.
[time=3452] In all things, we know that we are more than conquerors, you keep us by your love.
[time=3483] You keep us by your love, how hard, how hard, no man, no man, no man, no man.
[time=3505] The feeling is in your hands, how deep, how deep, how strong, never breaks, all you stand.
[time=3527] The feeling is in your hands.
