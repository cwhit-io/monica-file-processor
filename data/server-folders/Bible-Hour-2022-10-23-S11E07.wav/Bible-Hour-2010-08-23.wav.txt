[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=33] It's great to have you with us.
[time=35] My name's Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege of serving on staff here at Black Hawk as the senior pastor, and we at Black Hawk have the privilege week after week of connecting with you.
[time=46] It means a great deal to us, and it means a great deal to me.
[time=49] I look forward to these couple of minutes each week where I get to share with you kind of face-to-face things that God is doing here at Black Hawk and the things I have the privilege of being a part of.
[time=61] I can't wait for you to hear today's message.
[time=64] It's a message that I've been waiting to hear for weeks.
[time=67] I'm not teaching today, you'll hear.
[time=69] Instead, the guy who gives leadership and oversight to all of our student ministries here at Black Hawk, and that is Jesse Hanna.
[time=77] Jesse and his team, I tell you, God has been using them in these last several years to do really a revolutionary work in student ministries here in this area.
[time=87] The campuses that we're reaching now, the kids, the lives that we're impacting, the families that are being touched.
[time=95] It is an amazing thing that God is doing through Jesse and his leadership and his team, and from middle school all the way up to high school, it is a phenomenal thing to see.
[time=104] I'd love to invite you and your kids to come and check it out.
[time=108] We've got middle school and high school ministry available on Sunday mornings, and then Wednesday night at 7.30 across the street over in the asylum right here at Black Hawk.
[time=119] I would love for your high school kids to come and check out what God's doing through high school kids in this community.
[time=125] It's called 212, and they meet on Wednesday nights at 7.30, and it's a place where your student, freshmen all the way through seniors would be welcomed.
[time=136] They would be invited in, they'd be befriended, and they'd hear an amazing message in an atmosphere that I think they would really connect with.
[time=145] So, I'm grateful for Jesse and his team.
[time=147] Thankful for the message you're gonna hear today about Pharaoh.
[time=150] That's right, a message about Pharaoh, and if you remember Pharaoh and Moses and all the interactions they had, as Moses was trying to obey God and go to Pharaoh and see the people of Israel free from the slavery and the bondage of Egypt.
[time=166] Pharaoh was, he was pretty hard to deal with.
[time=169] He was pretty stubborn.
[time=171] He was pretty self-willed.
[time=173] And I think there's probably some things there for you and me to hear as we listen to Jesse unpack this story of Pharaoh.
[time=181] Hey, we're thankful, very thankful for you.
[time=184] If we can be of help to you at any time, let us know.
[time=186] If you have questions, please email them to us.
[time=189] We'd love to hear from you.
[time=190] Thank you for being a part of our family.
[time=192] God bless you, have a great week, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=197] [MUSIC - 170 seconds]
[time=372] (audience applauding)
[time=384] (gentle guitar music)
[time=400] [MUSIC - 212 seconds]
[time=624] - Now one more time worthy is the lamb who is slain.
[time=628] [MUSIC - 74 seconds]
[time=711] (gentle guitar music) Will you pray with us?
[time=718] God, we thank you this morning.
[time=722] You are holy and we are not.
[time=728] You are perfect and we are not.
[time=730] You are creator and we're not.
[time=732] You authored the universe and we didn't.
[time=735] The sun, the moon and the stars and all creation praises your name by not ours.
[time=741] It's humbling though you just thank you God.
[time=746] You're not a God who's bigger than most or stronger than some.
[time=752] Or a God who only answers to a few.
[time=757] God you answered and no one.
[time=759] Your power, your majesty is unrivaled, unmatched in all of the universe and all of human history.
[time=769] God we thank you and praise you for who you are this morning.
[time=772] We pray that the things that we've spoken you out loud and even more importantly in our hearts are truth.
[time=781] 'Cause we know that we can't impress you, we can't fool you.
[time=786] We pray that you are pleased with this offering
[time=793] that we brought you this morning.
[time=795] It's your name and we pray.
[time=796] [AMEN] (gentle music)
[time=829] (gentle music)
[time=889] (gentle music) - Okay, that was good.
[time=906] Oh, the lights went down and something happened here.
[time=911] Did you do that?
[time=913] All right, don't turn them off again.
[time=915] (audience laughing) Goodness.
[time=919] School's back in session.
[time=920] How many are going to school?
[time=922] Students, parents, it's a little new time and everybody's getting back to school.
[time=926] I think what, Fort Wayne's Monday, is that correct?
[time=929] Yeah, anybody?
[time=930] Yeah.
[time=931] College students, anybody going off?
[time=934] Where's Newy?
[time=934] Dang it.
[time=938] Don't quit it.
[time=940] He's leaving me, that stinks.
[time=942] What a good, what a great season for us in the ministry.
[time=945] Schools are starting two 12s getting back going.
[time=947] Liquid's getting back going.
[time=948] We're getting back to a normal schedule and it's exciting, it's fun.
[time=952] And in the midst of all of that, I'm prepping this message on Pharaoh.
[time=956] What, Pharaoh, why Pharaoh?
[time=959] Would you lose a bet?
[time=960] (audience laughing) No, but by the time I got to choose the people, all the good ones were taken.
[time=967] (audience laughing) I think I was last.
[time=971] No, it came out of the discussion.
[time=975] Sunday morning, I would get together with some high school students nine o'clock.
[time=978] And we were talking one morning about Moses and then it led to Pharaoh, 'cause you can't really talk about Pharaoh, we'll talk about Moses.
[time=985] And they're asking me about God hardening his heart.
[time=989] How could God do that?
[time=991] Oh, he, man, then we got into determinism and predestination and Calvinism and a little bit.
[time=996] I'm like, whoa, whoa, I don't know where it's going, but we're just throwing all this stuff out here and we don't have an answer.
[time=1002] We didn't come to any conclusions.
[time=1004] So I thought, I think I'm gonna choose Pharaoh.
[time=1006] And we'll just see where it goes.
[time=1007] And what I discovered was that issue is really secondary to the texts of what's happening with Pharaoh.
[time=1016] And so I'm gonna pray and then I'm gonna jump right in.
[time=1019] We're gonna, what I've kind of done is I've taken, it kind of goes from chapter three and we go all the way to chapter 15.
[time=1028] And so I've tried to pull out chunks and smoosh them together and kind of look at how that works with Pharaoh.
[time=1034] So it'll seem like I'm never gonna get to Pharaoh 'cause the beginning isn't really about him, but I'm getting there.
[time=1040] So just hang in there, it's okay.
[time=1042] So let me pray.
[time=1044] Father, thank you that we can be together in this place, that we are people who desperately just wanna know who you are.
[time=1053] Some of us may be skeptical, some of us may not be convinced.
[time=1057] And that's okay.
[time=1057] We pray that you would continue to work on all of our hearts, that you would send your spirit here today.
[time=1064] You would work in our hearts, mold us and shape us.
[time=1067] God, we pray you would energize the texts that we're gonna read today.
[time=1071] We give you all the thankful.
[time=1074] We give you all the praise in the world in Christ me.
[time=1077] [AMEN] All right, chapter three, y'all should know, hopefully know, if you don't know, that's okay.
[time=1082] Moses and the burning bush.
[time=1084] So he's a bush, it's burning.
[time=1086] It's a butane bush because it doesn't stop, right?
[time=1090] And so he goes over and he's like, what's going on with the bush?
[time=1093] And the bush talks to him.
[time=1095] It's the Lord.
[time=1097] Moses doesn't run away, which is kind of interesting.
[time=1100] I think of a burning bush.
[time=1101] If a bush just talked to me, I probably wouldn't stick around.
[time=1104] But it was burning on top of that and he stayed.
[time=1106] And this is what the Lord said.
[time=1108] Chapter three, verse seven, the Lord said, I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt.
[time=1114] I've heard them crying out because of their slave drivers and I am concerned about their suffering.
[time=1120] So I've come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land into a good and spacious land.
[time=1127] They land flowing with milk and honey.
[time=1130] And then he says to Moses, so now go.
[time=1136] I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people,
[time=1142] the Israelites, out of Egypt.
[time=1145] So now you go, go talk to Pharaoh.
[time=1148] And I think Moses probably at the sound of that was like, no, you go, they're your people.
[time=1154] I don't want anything to do with this king of Egypt, this Pharaoh guy, 'cause he's a nasty dude.
[time=1160] So the question doesn't make a lot of sense until we understand the background.
[time=1165] And Moses isn't really convinced.
[time=1167] He's like, I'm not sure I wanna do that.
[time=1171] And he says this, suppose I go, this is Moses.
[time=1175] So I'm not saying I'm gonna do this.
[time=1179] So let's pretend I say yes.
[time=1181] Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them,
[time=1187] the God of our fathers has sent me to you and they ask me, what is his name?
[time=1191] What is his name?
[time=1196] Like I said, this question makes little sense until we understand the backdrop, the culture of what Moses was dealing with.
[time=1203] In that time, Egypt was a world power, complete dominance.
[time=1208] There was a pantheon of gods that they worshiped, idolatry.
[time=1212] And they exerted this lordship over Egypt and even into this and then because of these gods, Egypt had this power in international other lands.
[time=1223] So they were powerful.
[time=1225] And not only that, but the king of Egypt, the Pharaoh was thought to be a descendant of the gods.
[time=1232] So he himself was almost a god.
[time=1236] So that helps as Moses asks, he's asked a great question.
[time=1239] What is his name?
[time=1240] This God, there's tons of gods out there that people are worshiping and people are paying homage to and all this stuff.
[time=1247] And he's like, what's his name?
[time=1249] Which one, what are we talking about here?
[time=1251] And God gives him a great answer.
[time=1254] Verse 14, he says, I am who I am.
[time=1259] This is what you are to say to the Israelites.
[time=1262] I am has sent you.
[time=1266] I am.
[time=1268] God says, I am who I am, or I will be what I will be.
[time=1272] The name Yahweh can be inferred here, commonly translated Lord, capital L-O-R-D, Yahweh.
[time=1278] And it's closely connected to this verb, the intensification of the verb to be, to be.
[time=1286] This suggests that there is no eternal cause for God's existence outside of himself.
[time=1296] It seems to unite the notion of one who purely is with the notion of one who is in a continual process of revealing himself historically.
[time=1305] This Yahweh, he enters time and space.
[time=1310] He's not just a God who is distant.
[time=1312] He comes down.
[time=1313] He does thing in history on the planet.
[time=1317] He is doing things.
[time=1319] He is I am.
[time=1321] And later in John's Gospel we see Jesus say, I tell you the truth before Abraham, I am.
[time=1328] It's powerful.
[time=1331] God is self-existent, eternal, completely independent and utterly sovereign.
[time=1336] God is what is, and he depends on nothing and no one.
[time=1341] He is completely and solely self-deficient.
[time=1347] I was talking to my friend Dave Walters last week at the prayer service.
[time=1350] And they came up and he said, my relationship with God has nothing to do with me.
[time=1355] It has everything to do with Yahweh.
[time=1358] And so often we think it has way too much to do with us and way not enough to do about him.
[time=1365] It's powerful.
[time=1366] He is self-sufficient.
[time=1367] Not only is Moses asking what is his name, but he wants to know what God by what authority is this God have, this Yahweh, I am.
[time=1377] Great, we got his name.
[time=1379] But this isn't just an answer.
[time=1380] This isn't just a name.
[time=1382] We've all done that.
[time=1384] We hear from somebody that says, the homework's not due till next Thursday.
[time=1388] Who said, the teacher said that?
[time=1391] Or you say that.
[time=1393] We don't have to, if I were to tell you, you don't have to pay taxes.
[time=1395] Amen?
[time=1398] (audience laughs) That's awesome.
[time=1401] Nobody said it.
[time=1402] Okay, you'd say, who said that?
[time=1404] Who said that?
[time=1405] Did the, did Obama say that?
[time=1408] Then it might have some weight to it.
[time=1410] In other words, Moses is asking whether this God can accomplish what he's promised.
[time=1416] In other words, on whose authority do I have to say these things?
[time=1421] Whose authority?
[time=1423] What is there in his rep mutation that lends credibility
[time=1430] to what I'm going to say to the Israelites?
[time=1432] How suddenly can God be expected to deal with a host of powerful Egyptian deities?
[time=1438] Again, soon over the years he has apparently won no victories for his people.
[time=1442] The Israelites in Egypt, they want to know.
[time=1447] They've been oppressed savagery across so many years and they're crying out to their God with no let up.
[time=1454] They have ever reason to want to know what can he do?
[time=1458] On whose authority?
[time=1461] The answer is not simply a name or a label, but an assertion of authority, a confession of a central reality.
[time=1468] I am that I am.
[time=1471] It's a continual unfinished action.
[time=1475] Yahweh, authority.
[time=1478] He can get it done.
[time=1480] I am that I am.
[time=1484] I am the ising one, the one that is.
[time=1491] The one who always is, render it completely inappropriate to fruit of God as was or will be, because only the present is, makes any sense.
[time=1501] He always is, captures the authority of God.
[time=1504] The ising one, God is, I is, always.
[time=1509] Isaiah 52, 6 says this, therefore my people shall know what my name is and what it means.
[time=1518] Therefore they shall know that in that day I am he who speaks, behold I am, or behold I am, or behold I am, Yahweh.
[time=1529] Not only does it carry authority, but it also carries presence.
[time=1536] God is going to come down and his holy, awesome, majestic presence is going to be with them through Moses.
[time=1543] This God who is present, this God who is Yahweh is the one in the same God as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
[time=1550] He said this in 317, and I have promised to bring you out of your misery in Egypt into the land of all the itites, a land flowing with milk and honey.
[time=1558] He's promised that, and in a verse early we read it, 3/8, so I have come down to rescue you.
[time=1566] Yahweh has come down to rescue us, to rescue you.
[time=1572] In a great book by Brother Lawrence, he said you need not cry very loud.
[time=1579] He is nearer to us than we are aware of.
[time=1583] He is present, and not only is there authority and there's presence, but there's power.
[time=1589] So God lays out this plan, he's Yahweh, he is, he I am.
[time=1593] He says here's how it's going to go down, and I am powerful enough, and I have the authority to say these things, here's how it's going to go down.
[time=1600] Here we go, this is what's going to happen.
[time=1602] He says I know the King of Egypt will not let you go.
[time=1606] I know this, unless a mighty hand compels him, and he's going to compel him, we're going to find out how.
[time=1613] Verse 20, 20 says, so I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with wonders.
[time=1620] Another good way to say that is with extraordinary deeds.
[time=1624] And the third thing he says, not only that, but I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed towards you.
[time=1633] When you leave, they will be favorable to you.
[time=1637] So God has given us, given Moses, his name, his authority, his presence, his power.
[time=1642] This sets the stage for a showdown.
[time=1645] In this corner, Yahweh, in this corner, Pharaoh.
[time=1650] So we kind of skip chapter four,
[time=1656] if you're trying to fall along, I'm all over.
[time=1658] We're going to skip chapter four, because that's just God getting Moses to Egypt.
[time=1665] And Moses is like, I don't want to, I don't think I can, but I can't speak, you know, it does all that thing.
[time=1670] Kind of excuses.
[time=1671] My man, before he gets there, he says, but one more thing, one more thing.
[time=1676] And he tells us in 4.21.
[time=1679] But I will harden his heart, speaking of Pharaoh, so that he will not let my people go.
[time=1689] Here's Moses, burning bush, it's talking.
[time=1693] What did I eat last night?
[time=1694] He tells me to go to this guy, and so I'm getting ready.
[time=1699] Okay, you're going to harden his heart.
[time=1700] Cool, okay, what?
[time=1702] You want me to go there and talk to him, but you're going to harden his heart, and he won't let him go, but you want me to go ask him.
[time=1709] Am I getting that right?
[time=1710] Did I draw all the picture?
[time=1712] God, what are you talking about?
[time=1714] We're going to get to that.
[time=1715] But before I move on, I just wanted to briefly touch on this idea because this is kind of a controversial within Christianity, circles, and things, and just three things I wanted to mention about God-hardening Pharaoh's heart.
[time=1728] The first thing is this.
[time=1730] In the story line so far, the assumption is that Pharaoh is already a wicked person.
[time=1737] Clue number one, he enslaved God's people, and he treats them really poorly, okay?
[time=1741] If we're not sure they're bad people, or Moses is a bad dude, he's messing with God's people, and that's no good.
[time=1748] And so, and this is not a morally neutral man.
[time=1752] God's kind of pronounced judgment on a wicked man, okay?
[time=1757] Hell itself is a place where repentance is no longer possible.
[time=1760] And God's hardening effort here is just imposing that sentence a little earlier than usual.
[time=1768] These aren't easy things to say, but this is some things that I glean from D.A. Carson.
[time=1773] This is just a few things that he mentioned about that passage.
[time=1777] In all humanity, sorry, in all human activity, God is never completely passive.
[time=1785] This is sovereign God.
[time=1789] No surprises for God.
[time=1791] Can't surprise God.
[time=1794] Oh, I didn't know you had to do that.
[time=1797] Hmm, okay, he's never completely passive.
[time=1800] We live in a theistic universe.
[time=1802] It's the basic tenet of our worldview.
[time=1805] This God is present and active, and so much so that God's hardens Pharaoh's heart, and Pharaoh hardens his own heart.
[time=1812] And these are far from being disconnected actions.
[time=1814] They are mutually complimentary.
[time=1816] The third thing is, this is not the only passage where this kind of action is found God doing these things.
[time=1824] First Kings 22, you can write these down.
[time=1826] First Kings 22, Ezekiel 14, nine, and 2 Thessalonians 2, 11 to 12.
[time=1832] So that doesn't answer the question.
[time=1834] Okay, that doesn't solve the problem like a math problem, but God is so incomprehensible that we just must simply say, he is God and we are not.
[time=1844] He is God and we are not.
[time=1846] And it's always a great question before I move on.
[time=1848] It's always a great question to ask, what does the rest of scripture do with this?
[time=1853] And in Romans 9, it says this, in 16.
[time=1856] It does not therefore depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy.
[time=1861] For the scripture says to Pharaoh, I raised you up for this very purpose that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.
[time=1872] Therefore, God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.
[time=1878] So I want to move on quickly.
[time=1881] I don't want to stop there.
[time=1882] Here's how the rest of the story is going to go.
[time=1885] If I was writing a book, these would kind of be the chapter headings as I kind of smooshed it all together.
[time=1890] The first is the request, the second is the confrontation, the third is the extraordinary deeds, the fourth is the Egyptian change, and the fifth is the Exodus, the final act of God, okay?
[time=1902] So the request, Moses finally gets the Pharaoh.
[time=1905] Here we go, chapter five, Moses gets the Pharaoh.
[time=1908] This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says, let my people go, we've heard this.
[time=1912] Sunday school stories felt boards, got it.
[time=1915] So they may hold a festival to me in the desert, let my people go.
[time=1919] Here's Pharaoh's response.
[time=1922] Who is the Lord?
[time=1926] Who is the Lord that I should obey him
[time=1932] and let Israel go?
[time=1935] I do not know the Lord and I will not let Israel go.
[time=1941] I will not let Israel go.
[time=1944] I don't know about you growing up ahead of super grandpa and I hung out with him a lot as a kid.
[time=1949] He had tractors and bulldozers and we hung out and I'd help him on occasion with fixing things and it was so fun.
[time=1956] But there was always just this sense of that's grandpa.
[time=1960] And I always wanted to be careful not to do something wrong around grandpa because he had a pretty good bark, right?
[time=1967] There was like this awesome fear of grandpa.
[time=1970] But at the same time, I was like, I love that dude, right?
[time=1973] But there's a super fear.
[time=1975] So you're kind of gonna tell you that reverence thing which you're always just a little scared.
[time=1979] And this would be like grandpa saying, Jess, would you grab me that screwdriver?
[time=1983] And this is kind of what's happened.
[time=1984] I just smack him in the face.
[time=1987] That's what Pharaoh does.
[time=1988] He just smacks God right in the face.
[time=1990] Says, who are you?
[time=1991] I don't know you.
[time=1993] He's gonna find out.
[time=1995] So the confrontation, Pharaoh, they give him a little more detail.
[time=2000] He says, hey, we wanna do this and this and he completely ignores them.
[time=2004] Doesn't even answer them this time.
[time=2006] He just says, get back to work, you're slow, you're lazy.
[time=2010] Make the same number of bricks, find your own straw.
[time=2013] I'm the worst boss ever in the history of the world.
[time=2017] Go, you're lazy.
[time=2018] I don't even like you people.
[time=2020] And so that's what Pharaoh, this is how, not only do they go to him and they ask this thing, all they wanted to do is worship their God.
[time=2028] Get out of here, make the same bricks.
[time=2030] I'm gonna make you work harder because I am a royal jerk.
[time=2033] And so on the way back, Moses, Aaron, they run into the Israelite form and they say, "Thanks a lot.
[time=2039] "Look at what she did.
[time=2042] "Why did you go talk to him?
[time=2045] "Oh, you messed it up.
[time=2046] "It's worse now.
[time=2048] "Now we're a stench to Pharaoh." And here's what Moses says.
[time=2052] Moses was adjourned to the Lord and says, "Oh Lord, he's, you know, whiny." Kind of whiny, I just picked him as whiny.
[time=2059] You have brought trouble upon these people.
[time=2061] Is this why you sent me here?
[time=2064] Is this the reason?
[time=2066] Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble upon this people and this real superwoman.
[time=2071] And you have not rescued your people at all.
[time=2075] I never get a cookie.
[time=2077] (congregation laughing) Why don't I get cookies?
[time=2079] You have not rescued your people at all.
[time=2084] Let's turn the page, chapter six, the music changes.
[time=2089] Something's gonna happen and it's gonna be good.
[time=2094] Here we go.
[time=2097] The hero, Jack Bauer is gonna blow something up.
[time=2099] (congregation laughing) Little Hulkamaniacs are screaming.
[time=2105] Oh, again, oh, again.
[time=2107] Any Hulkamaniacs out there?
[time=2108] Come on with it, come on.
[time=2110] You remember he's on the canvas.
[time=2111] You think, oh no, he's gonna lose.
[time=2113] And then all the people's like, oh, again, he starts getting up, you know, and they hit him.
[time=2116] He's like, you know, hogan, you guys hear me?
[time=2118] Anybody? Come on, come on, come on.
[time=2120] Hulkamaniacs, you know it's coming.
[time=2122] Here it comes.
[time=2123] He knows something good's gonna happen.
[time=2125] And this is what the Lord says to Moses.
[time=2127] Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh.
[time=2132] Who's the Lord?
[time=2133] Here he comes, Pharaoh.
[time=2134] Here's your answer.
[time=2135] And in the Hebrew, there's a technical construction of the vowels and the verbs and things.
[time=2139] Our study Hebrew, awesome.
[time=2140] And so it reads like this, let's get it on, Pharaoh.
[time=2145] Ding, ding.
[time=2147] Here's what he says, because of my mighty hand,
[time=2154] he will let them go.
[time=2156] Because of my mighty hand, he will dry them out of his country.
[time=2160] He's not just gonna let them go.
[time=2161] He's gonna hurry, get out of here.
[time=2163] We can't handle what the Lord is bringing.
[time=2166] Get out of here now.
[time=2168] That's gonna happen.
[time=2170] God said to Moses, I am the Lord.
[time=2173] I appear to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob is God Almighty, but by my name, the Lord, I did not make myself known to them.
[time=2179] I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan.
[time=2184] Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites whom the Egyptians are enslaving.
[time=2188] And I've remembered my covenant.
[time=2190] And he keeps going, verse six.
[time=2192] Therefore, say to the Israelites, I am the Lord and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians, my favorite part, verse seven.
[time=2199] I will take you as my people and I will be your God.
[time=2204] Yahweh, authority, power, presence.
[time=2210] I will take you as my people and I will be your God.
[time=2215] Then you will know that I am the Lord, your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.
[time=2222] And I'll bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to Abraham, to Isaac and Jacob.
[time=2228] I will give it to you as a possession.
[time=2230] I am the Lord, I is, I am Yahweh.
[time=2235] And so, the music continues and all of a sudden,
[time=2242] it's like here comes the extraordinary digs in your Bible's a pride called plagues.
[time=2247] We get the blood and the Egyptians can do the same thing and Pharaoh heartens his heart.
[time=2251] And then we get all these frogs and he throws frogs everywhere.
[time=2255] They're under their beds, they're in their beds.
[time=2257] And Pharaoh said, can you guys take away the frogs?
[time=2261] And this is kind of funny, Moses says, okay, I'll pray to God and we'll take away the frogs, but when would you like that?
[time=2268] And instead of saying like, right now would be great, there's frogs everywhere.
[time=2272] He says, hmm, how about tomorrow?
[time=2275] He does Yahweh or does he have time tomorrow?
[time=2277] Wait, maybe next Tuesday.
[time=2278] That doesn't make sense to me, right now.
[time=2281] He says no, tomorrow.
[time=2282] He doesn't get it.
[time=2283] Pharaoh still has no clue who this God is.
[time=2286] Tomorrow and Pharaoh heartened his heart would not listen again.
[time=2291] Then we get gnats, gnats everywhere.
[time=2292] There's everywhere.
[time=2295] And this is a little different.
[time=2296] The Pharaoh's magician said to Pharaoh, this is the finger of God, they couldn't do it.
[time=2302] But Pharaoh's heart was hard and he would not listen.
[time=2307] Then they give him the flies and his heart was hardened.
[time=2311] Then the livestock, all the livestock's are dying and the boils are all over people.
[time=2316] And hail and locusts and darkness for three days.
[time=2319] And then the first born are gonna be killed.
[time=2325] And this kind of leads to the Passover, where he kind of gives us this really cool ceremony Passover deal where they take a lamb without defect and then they slaughter it.
[time=2335] And they take the blood and they put it on the door post and the top and on the sides, which is across, top and side, boom.
[time=2341] And as God passes through Egypt, he'll strike down every first born men and animal and he'll bring judgment on the gods of Egypt.
[time=2350] But you guys, you Israelites will be spared.
[time=2352] I am Yahweh all throughout the plagues
[time=2358] so that you will know that I am.
[time=2360] So you will know that I'm God.
[time=2362] So you will know that in this ring that you step in when you say Yahweh who or God, who is this God?
[time=2368] Now you know who I am.
[time=2371] Powerful picture.
[time=2373] And finally, Pharaoh's response is, get all of your people and your animals and leave.
[time=2379] Please leave, take them, go.
[time=2382] We can't take it anymore.
[time=2384] And all the Egyptian people said, hurry, get out of here or we will die.
[time=2390] And the cool part is God made them favorable to them.
[time=2393] They did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold for clothing.
[time=2399] Lord had made the Egyptians favorably disclosed exactly what God said happened.
[time=2405] Yahweh, he said it, it happened.
[time=2409] It's awesome.
[time=2410] And then finally the Exodus, his final act of redemption, of getting them away.
[time=2418] Not only is it the Israelites get away through the water that God parts, but he hardens Pharaoh's heart again and they come and they chase after him.
[time=2427] But it was too late.
[time=2429] As they go through the waters there, as they go through where God had part of the waters, final, decisive judgment on Pharaoh.
[time=2441] It's over, Pharaoh dies, end of the story.
[time=2444] And the Israelites are saved.
[time=2446] God divided the waters.
[time=2451] Yahweh, his power, his presence.
[time=2459] And his authority to do what he said, to do the things he is, is awesome.
[time=2465] And so as you're just right here, we did this over there, we're just gonna do it here because I think it's cool, I think we can handle this.
[time=2471] The first thing, just turn to your neighbor.
[time=2473] I'm gonna have just a couple of questions to kind of take this story and what do we do with that?
[time=2477] I mean, this Yahweh is powerful, it's presence, it's God.
[time=2482] But what do we do with that?
[time=2483] The first thing in your relationship with God, are you close enough to call him Yahweh, or have you become a little distant that it would be a little uncomfortable?
[time=2493] All right, let's do number two.
[time=2498] Or the next one.
[time=2499] I think it should come up here soon.
[time=2501] Do you allow God to be the single authority in your life?
[time=2505] Or do you allow family, friends, or culture to determine how you live?
[time=2509] Do you allow God to be the single authority in your life?
[time=2517] Okay, let's do the next one.
[time=2522] Let me explain this one.
[time=2525] The cool part about this message, I think the overwhelming theme is Yahweh is present, and his authority, his power, and his name, and just he is present, he has come down to rescue.
[time=2538] And so the God who did all the things we just saw, all the flies and all the things like he rescued his people, that is the God we serve today, it's the same God.
[time=2548] But so often we take God and we put him in this drawer, and then the only time we really think about that, or we really understand that his presence is with us, is when we have that drawer open, we kind of limit God to our quiet time, or we're Baptist, we're good at quiet times, right?
[time=2568] Okay, that's not the only time that God is with us.
[time=2570] He's with you when you go to the bathroom, when you're in the shower, when you're at work, when your boss is being a jerk to you, right?
[time=2578] He's with you when the marriage is not clicking right, he's like, ah, bro, God is right there.
[time=2584] Maybe your kids are driving you crazy, God's right there with you, he's right there.
[time=2591] And it's just a simple, we just need to train ourselves, remember that his presence is with us.
[time=2597] That is tremendous privilege, that the Israelites would eventually lose the pillar of fire, and the cloud of the pillar of smoke, and the pillar of fire.
[time=2608] That was God's presence, tremendous privilege that they had.
[time=2613] That was restored by Christ when the Holy Spirit comes.
[time=2616] We have that, we don't have to ask for it, we don't have to come into a room to find it.
[time=2622] It's right there.
[time=2624] And so the third question is this, do you practice a continual remembrance of God's active and continual presence in your life?
[time=2632] And if not, how do we do that?
[time=2634] Go ahead and just discuss that, just that whole concept is, I think we miss it sometimes.
[time=2639] Let's do the next one.
[time=2647] Well, one last one.
[time=2648] I shall hope you're okay with talking to each other.
[time=2652] I mean, so often I think we come, we sit, we listen, we go, and it just seems I'm a super relational guy, and it just almost kills me not to do, I like talk to everybody.
[time=2662] I just, so many of you, I can't talk to everybody, but at least, man, it needs, we just still value conversation.
[time=2669] It's not just where stories are heard, and ideas are shared, and even if it's just weird questions by a weird guy up on the stage.
[time=2678] What are some areas of struggle that you need God's touch to come and rescue you from?
[time=2683] What are some things in your life that you need an exodus from?
[time=2687] You need God to come and rescue you, 'cause he can.
[time=2691] Go ahead, talk 'em with yourselves.
[time=2692] I sure hope you had good conversations
[time=2704] with the people next to you.
[time=2706] Thanks for letting me be here as the man plays.
[time=2708] Just respond by singing, or with your eyes closed,
[time=2716] or with your head bowed.
[time=2718] However you need to respond to this, because Yahweh is the same God then as today.
[time=2724] He is alive, and he's active, and he's powerful, and he's good, he has the authority, the only authority in all of the universe to do whatever his purposes need to be.
[time=2741] God has a bigger picture that is involved than just a little pharaoh.
[time=2746] It's bigger than that, but he has chosen a people for himself so that he could be their God.
[time=2754] He's our God today.
[time=2757] He's our God.
[time=2758] He is.
[time=2760] It's authority, his power, and his presence.
[time=2765] Remember his presence, he's with you.
[time=2768] So as the band plays, think about God.
[time=2771] Just dwell on him.
[time=2779] (gentle guitar music) - All right, I'm gonna sing, "I Lived You High"
[time=2799] and "About On Low." [MUSIC - 130 seconds]
[time=2944] - All right, we're gonna sing this a few more times.
[time=2955] We're gonna give you an opportunity to do something we'll probably don't do a lot, maybe kind of weird.
[time=2960] But if there's room there where you're sitting and you feel like that you kind of just want to have a physical expression of what we're saying, if you were convicted all I like I was during this, I don't often, don't often think of God as Galway as ever present.
[time=2978] I just kind of want to embody the lyrics and songs so that we lift you high and down on low.
[time=2984] I just want to invite you just to take a knee right where you are, if there's your room.
[time=2989] I know for some it's not gonna be physically comfortable or possible and that's totally okay and you don't have to and obviously I'm not going to because I'm gonna be up here but just to take a posture.
[time=3002] So we're just gonna sing this a few more times and if you want to, I'd love to invite you just about.
[time=3014] (gentle music) All right, we're gonna sing "I Lived You High"
[time=3023] and down on low.
[time=3024] [MUSIC - 410 seconds]
[time=3440] Hey, pray with me, would you? Father in Heaven, we're grateful for the reminder that we've had today of your presence and your authority
[time=3458] and your power and God, your presence in our lives, in the every day, in the every place, in the every moment of our lives.
[time=3468] May the awareness of that change the way we not only view you, but God may it alter how we live.
[time=3476] May we live and choose with the reality of your presence, and may our choices and our living make much of you.
[time=3485] And in your son's name we pray. Amen.
