[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=33] It's great to have you with us.
[time=34] And as always, I mean that.
[time=36] It is good for us to get to spend this time with you and we hope it continues to be an encouragement to you.
[time=42] I think today is gonna be an enormous encouragement to you.
[time=46] And a lot of that has to do with my good friend, Dr. Mitchell Cruz, who is with us again today.
[time=52] And you're gonna get a chance to hear a message that Mitch and I are gonna do this morning here in our worship service and Mitch, welcome back.
[time=60] - Thank you.
[time=61] - Good honor to be back.
[time=62] - Good to have you with us.
[time=63] Most of you know, others of you might not know that Mitch was a part of our team here for about five, six years as the teaching pastor at Black Hawk.
[time=72] And in the midst of the years leading up to that, those five, six years and every week since, God has given us the privilege of a great friendship.
[time=82] And Mitch, why don't you tell everybody what a great guy I am.
[time=86] Kelly's a great guy.
[time=87] (laughing) Actually, I do think that you are really unique as a senior pastor to allow me to come in and volunteer as a teaching pastor for that time period to share the pulpit, so to speak with me.
[time=102] The you and I, you know, we've had lots of conversations with lots of people, that's virtually unheard of.
[time=107] And I will be forever thankful for your investment in my life.
[time=110] And you've helped me be a recovering perfectionist.
[time=113] There we go, there we go, it's an honor.
[time=116] It's an honor to get to help you in that way.
[time=118] And we'll be forever really indebted to the service that you gave, not only the Lord, but to this family hundreds and hundreds of lives impacted by Mitchell's ministry.
[time=128] And since Mitch left us here, God has given him the great opportunity to write a book called Restoration Road.
[time=134] And Restoration Road really is more than a book.
[time=137] It's a movement.
[time=138] There are materials that you can get with the book.
[time=141] There's DVDs, there's a website.
[time=143] And I know because of our friendship that Restoration Road is going all over the world.
[time=148] Give the folks, since you were here last, give the folks an update on kind of how that whole journey has been and what God's doing through the Restoration Road project.
[time=157] - Well, when you're writing a book, a study guide and producing a DVD, you're thinking about the end product.
[time=163] What's it gonna look like?
[time=165] Is it gonna be easy to read?
[time=166] What will people think when they read it?
[time=168] But I realized that this is just a tool to introduce people to the restore and the spiritual invisible heart change that's happened.
[time=179] It's just incredible to me.
[time=181] It's totally a God thing.
[time=183] And that's what keeps me going to fund it.
[time=186] (laughing) 'Cause it is non-profit.
[time=189] But I'm amazed and it's through that feedback that we've started the television ministry, the Restoration Road, and it's just been amazing.
[time=200] - Sunday morning, right?
[time=200] - Sunday mornings on NBC 33 and the sister station to this.
[time=205] - 730?
[time=206] - Uh-huh.
[time=207] - 730 AM and then a few Christian national networks are gonna carry it.
[time=212] We're really excited about that this fall and anybody can go to the website and see any episode.
[time=216] I'd encourage you to watch the one with my dad.
[time=218] - And you.
[time=219] - There you go.
[time=220] - Those were just so much fun to do.
[time=222] We've got another one coming up with you.
[time=223] - Yeah.
[time=224] - So, the Restoration Road.com, Mitchcrus.com.
[time=227] - Yeah, it's great to see what God's doing through Mitchell's giftedness and his time and his investment.
[time=233] It's a great book.
[time=234] I would encourage you if you haven't read it to go get it and to take a look at it.
[time=238] And thank you for being here today.
[time=239] We are gonna do our best to just in, you know, 40 minutes or so, tell the story of Solomon.
[time=245] And what God did through Solomon and Solomon's life and the things he did well and the bunch of things he didn't do well, there's some things probably for you to learn along with us.
[time=256] So, thank you for tuning in.
[time=257] God bless you.
[time=258] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=260] - So, we're gonna proclaim this next song.
[time=264] Just pray God save us.
[time=266] And now in this next song, we get to sing out that it is our God who saves.
[time=271] We've gathered together this morning, all different personalities, all different colors, all different shapes, all different sizes.
[time=278] But when we meet together in this room, we come under the umbrella of children of God.
[time=283] And we, in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, in the name of the Spirit, just like we're gonna sing, come together, just sing about our God who saves us.
[time=292] Sing us out together.
[time=294] [MUSIC - 268 seconds]
[time=567] (audience applauds) - Amen.
[time=579] Thanks for singing that out with us.
[time=580] It's true, isn't it?
[time=581] You may be seated.
[time=583] Thanks for worshiping with us in those songs.
[time=588] (audience applauds) You like having the choir back?
[time=594] Maybe it's a chance for you to see what I see
[time=600] when you're sitting here worshiping as you see all those faces just proclaiming truth and song.
[time=606] They're gonna sing a song for you today that's along the same lines that we've been singing, this need of a savior, this amazing God who not only promises to say, but then he actually doesn't.
[time=618] Ephesians chapter one, Paul's writing a prayer and I wanna read it for you this morning before the choir sings about our saving God.
[time=624] Ephesians chapter one, it says, "Paul, I pray also that the eyes of your heart might be enlightened in order that you may know three things, the hope to which he's called you, that you may know the riches of his glorious inheritance and the third thing, that you may know his incomparably great power for us who believe.
[time=647] And then he describes the third thing, he describes the power, he says this about the power, that power is like the working of his mighty strength which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at the right hand in the heavenly realms.
[time=661] He seated Christ far above all rule, all authority, all power, all dominion in every title that can be given, he's above it.
[time=669] Not only in the present age, but also in the age to come.
[time=673] So think about those words as the choir sings this song.
[time=677] (guitar strumming) (upbeat music)
[time=688] [MUSIC - 97 seconds]
[time=793] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 46 seconds]
[time=851] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 126 seconds]
[time=990] (audience applauds) - I am grateful to have Dr. Mitchell Cruz
[time=1003] with us this morning, and would you all welcome him?
[time=1006] Some of you know, some of you know Mitchell and I story.
[time=1013] It was 2000 in the fall of 2000, 10 years ago, almost.
[time=1017] And we were at a conference at Willow Creek, 4,500 people just slammed into this huge auditorium.
[time=1025] I believe there was one seat open in the entire place.
[time=1029] I was late, shocker, I know.
[time=1032] And I'm looking for a place to sit and the one seat in the entire place is next to Mitch.
[time=1037] And I sit down and he gives me that, I know you from the Bible hour look, and we didn't know each other from Adam, but we just started talking and had a great, great night, ended up sitting together the next day, and a friendship was birthed and it has gone for 10 years.
[time=1051] He served here as a teaching pastor for about five, six years, and then recently has gone off to do some things that God had put on his heart.
[time=1061] He's written a book entitled Restoration Road.
[time=1064] Restoration Road is really more than a book.
[time=1066] It's a movement.
[time=1067] It is going all over the world.
[time=1070] There's a workbook that goes with it that God is using to grow people and encourage the body.
[time=1076] There's a DVD series, now a television show on Sunday mornings at 7.30 on 33.
[time=1082] And we're really thankful to have him with us this morning.
[time=1084] And I'm really grateful.
[time=1086] You just need to know what encouragement, and I mean this, what a huge encouragement he has been to your pastor for all these years.
[time=1094] He has invested in my family.
[time=1096] He has cared for me as a friend.
[time=1099] He has spoken into my life on numerous occasions.
[time=1102] He has been a source of encouragement and hope.
[time=1104] And he continues to be such we meet every Thursday for lunch.
[time=1108] And it's something I look forward to, and I'm really glad he's here.
[time=1111] So, Mitch, you can tell them all kinds of good things about me.
[time=1114] [LAUGHTER] Well, when I met this guy, I was a recovering perfectionist.
[time=1122] And he has taught me that absolutely nothing matters.
[time=1125] [LAUGHTER] I even told I could see this coming up in a couple of my girls.
[time=1131] The perfectionism thing.
[time=1132] And I said, you need to find your Kelly Bird.
[time=1135] I go, he's changed my life, man.
[time=1137] Look, I'll eat after somebody else.
[time=1139] It just doesn't matter, you know?
[time=1142] So, actually, everything he said about me, I could say about him.
[time=1146] He's the investment he's made in my life, and my family has changed me forever.
[time=1151] Well, and also you.
[time=1152] I mean, as I look throughout this room, and I see so many people I love so much, so many people have invested in me, and people that I've been able to pray with this round of your life to Christ.
[time=1162] And I follow you, I watch you, I'm paying attention to you, and I'm just so thankful for my time with you.
[time=1172] We asked you all to vote on what we should teach on today.
[time=1175] Send an email out, and a lot of you texted in your votes, and some of you replied on the email, Solomon, won the day over Elijah.
[time=1182] Ray Abom was a distant third, and so we come this morning to Solomon, and I want to invite you to open your Bibles if we're going to go back and forth to a few places, but open your Bibles to Ecclesiastes.
[time=1194] Ecclesiastes, and we're going to head back to first Kings a little bit.
[time=1198] We're going to spend some time, maybe, in a few different places, but we'll start there in Ecclesiastes, and as you're opening to Ecclesiastes, let me ask you a question.
[time=1207] For those of you in the room this morning who have encountered, embraced, fully surrendered your heart and life to the Lord.
[time=1220] For those of you who would say, those of you in the room today, and those of you listening online, and those of you watching on the broadcast, if you'd say that you've embraced and bowed the knee of your heart to the Lord, and I know many of you would, how many of you who have done that would also say that while you've embraced and surrendered your heart and life to the Lord, you've also pursued knowledge, possessions, might and power, money,
[time=1252] or pleasure apart from Him.
[time=1258] You don't have to raise your hand.
[time=1259] I know it would be most of the room.
[time=1262] I know that there are many of us in the room who, while we would say, most certainly, we have encountered and embraced Him.
[time=1270] You and I have continued to, at times, we've tried to find these things, power and possessions
[time=1278] and pleasure and knowledge and meaning and purpose apart from the very one we've embraced who promised us those very things.
[time=1287] Well, if you can identify with that, we introduce you to a man this morning who engaged in that probably more so than all of us combined.
[time=1298] His name is Solomon, and Mitch is going to start us off this morning and tell us a little bit about his background, who he was.
[time=1306] And before Mitch does that, let me pray, if I can.
[time=1309] Father, for everyone in the room this morning and those watching, we would just pause at this moment and pray, God, that you would give each of us a sense of honesty, a sense of transparency.
[time=1320] God, that we would have enough integrity and character in our hearts and souls this morning to allow the Word of God and the Spirit of God to say whatever might need to be said.
[time=1331] God communicates us, bring conviction, bring encouragement, bring a reminder, bring hope, but God, we open our hearts and our lives to you this morning.
[time=1342] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1344] Mitch, who was he?
[time=1346] - Solomon was the son of David and Beth Sheba.
[time=1349] It's kind of interesting, it shows the restorative power of God that he brought the line of the king.
[time=1355] - How many of you in the room didn't know that?
[time=1357] That he was the son of David and Beth Sheba.
[time=1360] Raise your hand if you didn't know that, yeah, a bunch of folks didn't know that.
[time=1364] - And he was named Jedidiah, which meant loved by the Lord, loved by the Lord, that's really important to grasp as we see his life.
[time=1372] He was Israel's third king who led its most prosperous 40 years, just incredible on what happened to the country of Israel during his leadership.
[time=1381] And the wisest man who ever lived before Christ, the wisest man who ever lived before Christ, now, both parts of Kelly's question are important here.
[time=1394] His encounter with God, his encounters with God were so powerful, yet still something inside him
[time=1405] would pursue life apart from God.
[time=1409] And so we're gonna look at what he did.
[time=1411] - What he did and more specifically what he pursued, you can follow along on the screen, what did King Solomon pursue?
[time=1420] He pursued number one, earthly knowledge.
[time=1424] Solomon had it in his mind to pursue earthly knowledge for the sake of contentment.
[time=1430] I wanna read to you from Ecclesiastes 1.
[time=1432] Here is Solomon's kind of look back at that pursuit.
[time=1436] Would you say that's a right way to say that?
[time=1439] This is Solomon's kind of his commentary on his pursuit of earthly knowledge.
[time=1446] I wanna read this to you, Ecclesiastes 1.12.
[time=1449] I, the preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem and I set my mind to seek and explore.
[time=1457] I love that word explore in the Hebrew.
[time=1459] It has to do with an all-out pursuit of that which is deemed to be valuable, that which is deemed to be significant and of great gain.
[time=1467] He sets his mind to seek and explore by wisdom, concerning all that has been done under heaven.
[time=1473] It is a grievous task which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.
[time=1478] I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun and behold all is vanity and striving after wind.
[time=1486] What is crooked cannot be straightened, what is lacking cannot be counted.
[time=1493] I said to myself, "Behold, I have magnified and increased wisdom more than all who were over Jerusalem before me.
[time=1501] And my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.
[time=1506] Set my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly.
[time=1509] I realize that this also is striving after wind because here it is verse 18.
[time=1516] Because in much wisdom there is much grief and increasing knowledge results in increasing pain." Mitch, what do you hear him saying there?
[time=1527] Well, contentment means literally to be held together.
[time=1532] And we have a tendency to think that if we can just know enough we can hold it all together.
[time=1539] But the risk is that we separate God out of that and we take control, we take the lead of our life and we make it about what we know.
[time=1552] But that's the thing for us to start wrestling with here is to see this whole idea of wisdom that Kelly's gonna talk about here in his encounter with God is God's heart intersecting with street smarts.
[time=1562] It's the vertical intersecting with the horizontal, how to make sense of my relationship with God with my horizontal relationships and tasks.
[time=1570] But even though we embrace that even though we fully surrender our lives to Christ as Savior and Lord, there's a tendency in each one of us to wanna seek that knowledge or that smartness apart from God so we can go on autopilot from Him.
[time=1588] And it's subtle.
[time=1589] Some of you know the story about Solomon on this wisdom front.
[time=1596] Many of you in the room have heard the story of how he got so much of it.
[time=1602] And I wanna just take you back there.
[time=1603] There's some things on this wisdom front.
[time=1606] There are some things about his life and some things that we can talk to you about this morning that weren't even necessarily bad or evil.
[time=1613] It just gives you an insight into the ability and the opportunity God gave him through this wisdom.
[time=1618] Go back to first Kings, if you would.
[time=1620] First Kings chapter three.
[time=1621] Most of you know the story that God came to Solomon.
[time=1626] Think about this.
[time=1626] Think about if it was you.
[time=1629] Think about what your response would be if God came to you and said, "Hey, I will give you whatever you want.
[time=1637] "Name it, it's yours." Comes to Solomon and he says, "I'm gonna give you whatever you desire." Most of you in the room know that what Solomon said was, "I want what?" Say it, wisdom.
[time=1649] He chooses wisdom.
[time=1650] And so look at God's response.
[time=1652] First Kings chapter three, it was pleasing verse 10.
[time=1655] It was pleasing in the sight of the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing.
[time=1659] So God said to him, "Because you have asked this thing "and have not asked for yourself long life, "nor have asked riches for yourself, "nor have you asked for the life of your enemies, "but instead you've asked for discernment "to understand justice.
[time=1678] "Behold, I have done according to your words.
[time=1681] "Behold, I have given you a wise and discerning heart "so that there has been no one like you "before you, nor shall one like you arise after you." Watch this.
[time=1693] I have also given you what you have not asked.
[time=1697] Both riches and honor so that there will not be any among the kings like you all of your days.
[time=1703] If you walk, listen, if you walk in my ways,
[time=1710] keeping my statutes and commandments, as your father David walked, then I will prolong your days.
[time=1720] And Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream, and he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord and offered, were an offerings and made peace offerings and made a feast for all of his servants.
[time=1731] - A very good thing, a very good thing.
[time=1736] And then it's interesting, he builds a temple, he dedicates a temple and he prays.
[time=1742] And then you know that second chronicle 714, that famous, that popular verse that we refer to a lot of my people who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven.
[time=1756] And we'll forgive their sin and we'll hear their land.
[time=1760] What's so interesting to me is that the chapter before, in chapter six, I think it's verses 24 and 25, Solomon actually prays that request to God.
[time=1771] It's incredible the intimacy that he had with God.
[time=1776] It's just incredible.
[time=1779] And what he's saying here and ecclesiastes on the difference on what happened to him is the same thing that Jesus' half brother says in James 3 13 through 16.
[time=1787] He says, you know what, there's two kinds of wisdom.
[time=1790] He said, there's one that comes from a selfish ambition just basically to know as much as you can and take control of your own life.
[time=1798] It's the street smarts, the horizontal apart from the vertical.
[time=1803] But the other kind of wisdom that comes from a humble heart, one that's fully surrendered to the Father.
[time=1812] That's the wisdom God desires for us.
[time=1815] And that's the risk that each one of us has.
[time=1819] And when we break apart the vertical from the horizontal, we have a tendency to break that up into four pieces and it creates a prison and we're the ones who are incarcerated.
[time=1831] Now, Solomon did a lot of great things.
[time=1835] He offered wise advice to many world leaders who traveled to meet him.
[time=1839] He authored Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs and two Psalms, you know and dwelled by the Holy Spirit, moved by the Spirit of God to do that.
[time=1848] He spoke 3,000 Proverbs and wrote 1,005 songs.
[time=1854] He described plant life.
[time=1856] He taught about animals, birds, reptiles and fish.
[time=1859] All this tremendous intimate experience with the creator of the universe.
[time=1867] But still he said, I still pursued knowledge apart from him and it's meaningless.
[time=1877] We do that oftentimes in our own lives and it's so subtle.
[time=1883] It can even happen to us with the Bible.
[time=1885] We'll read the Bible and we'll take a verse out of there and we'll use it just to prove to others how much we know and then in an argument with a spouse or a child, we might take that verse and lord it over that person and say, you don't do this.
[time=1902] And it was just like that for me.
[time=1906] It's quite a long time ago and I was still in business with my dad and I was with my uncle David, a very wise attorney and I was looking at a Bible verse.
[time=1916] We were talking about the Bible together and I said, look at that right there.
[time=1921] That's exactly what my dad is doing to me.
[time=1924] I gotta show that to him.
[time=1926] And David and only the way that uncle David could do kind of clear his throat and he said, yeah.
[time=1934] We really have a tendency to wanna read the Bible and show how somebody else is doing that wrong.
[time=1941] He said, but really it's for us to ask the Spirit of God
[time=1948] to examine our own hearts and say, oh, this is what I'm doing wrong.
[time=1955] And that moment, those words changed my life.
[time=1959] And so that's the way I try to read this thing is you know, God, how am I doing that?
[time=1966] Otherwise, we risk pursuing knowledge apart from God for the sake of just contentment of holding it all together ourselves.
[time=1975] And Solomon said, it's meaningless.
[time=1977] - King Solomon pursued earthly knowledge for the sake of contentment.
[time=1982] Write this down, secondly, he pursued earthly possessions.
[time=1986] Earthly possessions for the sake of significance.
[time=1990] Look at Ecclesiastes two.
[time=1992] Earthly possessions for the sake of significance, Ecclesiastes two, four.
[time=1999] I enlarged my works, it says here.
[time=2001] I want you to listen for the operative word.
[time=2006] There's a word I want you to pick up, it won't be hard, but just pay attention here.
[time=2010] I enlarged my works, I built houses for myself.
[time=2015] I planted vineyards for myself.
[time=2018] I made gardens and parks for myself, and I planted in them in those gardens and parks, all kinds of fruit trees.
[time=2025] I made ponds of water for myself, from which to irrigate a forest of growing trees.
[time=2032] I bought male and female slaves, and I had home-born slaves.
[time=2036] Also, I possessed flocks and herds together, flocks and herds larger than all who preceded me in Jerusalem.
[time=2044] Also, I collected for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces.
[time=2052] Operative word through those verses was the word what?
[time=2055] It becomes slowly and slowly more and more so with Solomon, all about who?
[time=2062] Him, me.
[time=2067] Myself.
[time=2068] What I can gain and what that will look like and what it'll bring and how it'll make me feel.
[time=2074] Earthly possessions for the sake of significance.
[time=2078] He constructed the temple, not a bad thing, but I want you to watch how this works.
[time=2083] He constructed the temple for God.
[time=2085] You read about it in 1 Kings 6.
[time=2088] He constructed the temple of God in seven years.
[time=2091] It was an amazing accomplishment.
[time=2093] The temple, as some of you know, was built on Mount Moriah.
[time=2096] This temple completion came 480 years after the exodus.
[time=2101] The temple itself was two times as big as the first tabernacle that we see there, a place of meeting where the folks could come, the people of Israel could come and worship their God.
[time=2112] Twice as big as the tabernacle and exodus, it was an amazing accomplishment.
[time=2117] This incredibly ornate and majestic construct and they did everything they could to make it worthy of their great God.
[time=2126] Interesting though, that upon completion of the temple, he builds his own palace that took almost 14 years to build.
[time=2134] He spends twice as much time and twice as much effort
[time=2143] building his own house as he does the house of the Lord.
[time=2148] Question for you, Mitch and I would just wanna give you just a moment of just pause there to think about that.
[time=2156] How much effort, how much time, how much energy?
[time=2161] We know everybody's not building temples and palaces.
[time=2165] We understand that.
[time=2166] How much time and energy though are you giving to his house versus yours?
[time=2174] How much time and energy are you willing to give an offer to his kingdom and its efforts versus the time and energy
[time=2184] and resources you're willing to give to your kingdom and your efforts, your plans?
[time=2191] It's a great question.
[time=2193] Solomon seems to have gotten a little bit of that wrong.
[time=2196] He seems to have been a little off track.
[time=2199] More on that later, he constructed the wall around Jerusalem.
[time=2203] What else, Mitchell, do you see there?
[time=2205] - He built a fleet of ships.
[time=2207] He constructed many cities.
[time=2209] He was famous.
[time=2211] The fact that kings and queens sought out his advice was proof of his renown.
[time=2215] They came from all over the world to talk to him and get his advice.
[time=2219] He was a leader.
[time=2220] The community of Israel was climbing the ladder of socioeconomic power, proving that Solomon's influence was big, even to the harshest of skeptics.
[time=2232] You know, significance has the word in it, sign.
[time=2237] And it says, hey, look at me.
[time=2239] This year's nothing wrong with owning possessions and the Bible's filled with godly people who own possessions.
[time=2248] The problem is when the possessions own me.
[time=2251] And I want them for people to say, hey, look at me.
[time=2256] Hey, look at me.
[time=2259] And it's as subtle as the teenage girl wanting that guy or that guy wanting that teenage girl.
[time=2268] So people will say, hey, look at me.
[time=2272] It's as subtle as starting on a team.
[time=2275] Not to surrender your gifts and your talents, your abilities to Christ and to help the team, to sacrifice your personal stats for the team, but it's to be on the team and to start so people say, hey, look at me.
[time=2288] They'd at work to move up the corporate ladder.
[time=2294] And we do it to say, hey, look at me, but not to deploy these gifts that God's given me.
[time=2302] It's so subtle and it hits us everywhere.
[time=2306] And Solomon is saying, the risk was that I pursued possessions for the sake of significance.
[time=2313] So people would say, hey, look at me, but you can't find significance anywhere but in a loving relationship with the God of the universe.
[time=2321] Otherwise, it's meaningless.
[time=2323] - Solomon pursued, let's keep going.
[time=2327] And I hope you're following along here, military might.
[time=2329] He pursued military might for the sake of control and I'm going to move through this quickly.
[time=2334] But I want to just tell you a couple of things.
[time=2336] He ruled over God's people, 1 Kings 1, 35.
[time=2340] He overtaxed his subjects, placed foreigners in forced labor, drafted his people into the military, 1 Kings 9.
[time=2349] He constructed, listen to this.
[time=2351] And before I tell you this, you mentioned this last hour.
[time=2356] Remember this about the people of God.
[time=2358] Remember this about the nation of Israel.
[time=2360] God always wanted it to be a theocracy.
[time=2364] God's desire was always to be their king.
[time=2369] He wanted to be their only king.
[time=2371] He wanted to be their God.
[time=2372] His desire was that he would be it with them yet.
[time=2375] He knew that when they would possess the land, that the time would come when they would whine and cry and say, give us our own, what, king.
[time=2384] And so he knew there'd be a king.
[time=2385] It was interesting way back in Deuteronomy 17.
[time=2388] He says, I know surely you will set a king over you whom the Lord your God chooses.
[time=2395] He's going to relent and give them one.
[time=2397] One from among your country men, you shall set as king over yourselves.
[time=2402] Listen to what it says in 16, Deuteronomy 17, 16.
[time=2405] Moreover, he shall, this is a decree from God, he shall not multiply horses for himself, nor shall he cause the people to return to Egypt to multiply horses since the Lord has said, do you, you shall never again return that way.
[time=2421] A lot of horses in Egypt is the point there.
[time=2424] And that's where they would go to get horses.
[time=2426] Guess what Solomon does?
[time=2428] He constructs, and Solomon would have known what I just read to you.
[time=2433] He constructs 4,000 stalls for chariot horses.
[time=2438] He has 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen.
[time=2445] Blows right past it.
[time=2447] God says, whoa, don't do this, Solomon, just boom.
[time=2452] Gonna go build it up, gonna go make it big.
[time=2455] Gonna go have it say something about him and all that he could acquire.
[time=2459] He built strategic fortresses, cities all over the place, as Mitch mentioned, Hazor, Megito, Gazir.
[time=2466] Here's the question for you.
[time=2468] He gradually became more and more about him, his own power, his own might, his own fame, his ability to conquer.
[time=2476] Do you believe, listen, do you believe this morning in your ability to conquer?
[time=2483] Whatever war you might be fighting, whatever battle you might be in, whatever skirmish is going on in your life today, whatever it is you're up against, whose might, whose strength, whose power, are you truly, really relying on?
[time=2500] Solomon gets to a point where he relies completely on his own, and it's impressive, but as he says at the end, empty.
[time=2510] There's more though, not just military might, but-- - Well, I think about that.
[time=2516] You know, I dealt with a couple guys who had armies, little armies, and it went well with them, thankfully.
[time=2524] But we probably don't have armies, military armies,
[time=2530] but we do create armies in relationships to power up on the other person.
[time=2536] And we take God out of that so we can take control, and win that argument, win that deal, whatever it is.
[time=2546] And I just, I think about that as what you were, everything you were saying on how subtle that ends up being in our lives that we try to do that apart from God, and it's meaningless.
[time=2557] But we also do, Solomon also pursued money for the sake of security, money for the sake of security.
[time=2569] Turn to Ecclesiastes 5, we're just gonna look at verses 10 through 20 quickly.
[time=2573] He said, "Whoever loves money will not be satisfied
[time=2579] "with money, nor he who loves abundance with its income.
[time=2583] "This too is vanity or meaningless.
[time=2587] "When good things increase, those who consume them increase.
[time=2590] "So what is the advantage to their owners except to look on?
[time=2594] "The sleep of the working man is pleasant, "whether he eats little or much, "but the full stomach of the rich man "does not allow him to sleep.
[time=2602] "He's dissatisfied.
[time=2603] "There is a grievous evil which I have seen "under the sun, riches being hoarded by their owner "to his hurt.
[time=2611] "When those riches were lost through a bad investment "and he had fathered his son, "then there was nothing to support him.
[time=2620] "As he had come naked from his mother's womb, "so he will return as he came.
[time=2623] "He will take nothing from the fruit of his labor "that he can carry in his hand.
[time=2627] "This also is a grievous evil, "exactly as a man is born, thus he will die.
[time=2631] "So what is the advantage to him who toils for the wind?
[time=2635] "Throughout his life, he also eats in darkness "with great vexations, sickness and anger.
[time=2640] "Here is what I have seen to be good and fitting, "to eat, to drink and enjoy oneself "and all one's labor in which he toils under the sun "during the few years of his life which God has given him.
[time=2651] "For this is his reward.
[time=2653] "Furthermore, for every man to whom God has given riches "and wealth, he has also empowered him to eat from them "and to receive his reward and rejoice in his labor.
[time=2662] "This is the gift of God.
[time=2664] "For he will not often consider the years of his life "because God keeps him occupied "with gladness of his heart.
[time=2671] "Our work is a gift from God, what we earn from it "is a gift from God, and we're meant to enjoy it as we go.
[time=2679] "I was in Germany looking at a one-of-a-kind automobile, "a classic car, it was a 12-cylinder special "roached or a horse, and I'm looking under the hood "with the owner, and he lived in a flat "in an apartment across the street, "and we're just in a garage.
[time=2697] "And this is at a time in my life where I'm really wrestling "with God, 'cause I was working really, really hard "to earn as much as I can so that someday I could enjoy it.
[time=2705] "And I was at that moment in my life wrestling "with what God was doing with that.
[time=2709] "And this guy looked like Steven Spielberg, "I used to sometimes say that at auctions when he was bidding.
[time=2714] "And he looks at me as we're looking under the hood "and he says, 'You know what, there's two ways to do life.' "I look at him.
[time=2721] "He said, 'One is to work really, really hard
[time=2727] "and hope that someday you can enjoy it.' "He says the other way to do it is enjoy it as you go.
[time=2735] "It's still work hard, but enjoy it as you go.' "He said, 'I've chosen the latter.'" And I read this, and I think it was basically quoting scripture.
[time=2748] You know, Solomon was wealthier than any other king on the planet.
[time=2754] The weight of gold that Solomon took in was about 50,000 pounds, 25 tons a year.
[time=2763] In today's value, he's taking in $800 million a year in income in gold alone, almost a billion dollars a year in gold alone.
[time=2772] We might not be taking in a billion dollars, but you know what, it doesn't matter, whether it's a billion or whether it's 10.
[time=2779] The risk is that we might pursue
[time=2785] money for the sake of security.
[time=2788] We might trust in the gifts and not the giver.
[time=2793] And at the end of the day, God's telling us, be free from worry, one foot out and trusting in yourself and one foot and trusting with me.
[time=2802] Why don't you get both feet in and trust in the giver and not the gifts?
[time=2808] He continues to pursue life apart from God.
[time=2814] He pursues pleasure for the sake of gratification.
[time=2818] Look at Ecclesiastes 2.1, I said to myself, pleasure.
[time=2822] He's pursuing pleasure for the sake of gratification.
[time=2825] Says there in two, one to three, I said to myself, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure himself." It's gonna test himself with the idea of pleasure and what brings it and what does it and to what degrees?
[time=2838] That's the testing that he refers to.
[time=2841] So enjoy yourself and behold, it too was futility.
[time=2845] I said of laughter, it is madness and of pleasure, what does it accomplish?
[time=2850] I explored with my mind how to stimulate my body with wine while my mind was guiding me wisely and how to take hold of folly until I could see what good there is for the sons of men to do under heaven the few years of their lives.
[time=2867] Says in Ecclesiastes 7, 12, for wisdom is protection just as money is protection.
[time=2874] For wisdom is protection just as money is protection but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the lives of its possessors.
[time=2886] He pursues pleasure for the sake of gratification.
[time=2891] He marries Pharaoh's daughter.
[time=2893] Some of you knew this, others of you may not have.
[time=2895] You may be married Pharaoh's daughter in 1 Kings 3, 1.
[time=2900] Why don't you turn there if you would just for a moment.
[time=2902] Go to 1 Kings, 1 Kings 3, let me read this to you.
[time=2907] 1 Kings 3, says now, then Solomon formed a marriage alliance
[time=2915] with Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
[time=2921] He's marrying women because of political alliances now and took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her to the city of David until he had finished building his own house and the house of the Lord and the wall around Jerusalem.
[time=2935] It's amazing.
[time=2937] Along with Pharaoh's daughter, the scriptures teaches in 1 Kings 11 that he took on a total of 700 wives.
[time=2944] Just kind of let you get your arms around that
[time=2950] for a minute, guys.
[time=2952] Orgals, either way, just 700 wives.
[time=2957] And on top of the 700 wives, it says there were 300 concubines.
[time=2962] 700 wives, 300 concubines.
[time=2968] And what did they do?
[time=2970] 1 Kings 11, 3.
[time=2975] He had 700 wives, princesses and 300 concubines and his wives turned his heart, what, away?
[time=2985] His wives turned his heart away.
[time=2989] Interesting, I read to you from Deuteronomy 17 about God's decrees, long, long, long before this.
[time=2996] Remember what he said about the horses?
[time=2998] Look at 17.
[time=3000] Deuteronomy 17, 17, prophetic, isn't it?
[time=3003] He shall not, this king that God was referring to, he was warning him.
[time=3007] He said, "He shall not multiply wives for himself "or else his heart will turn away, "nor shall he greatly increase silver." And what do you think he said next?
[time=3022] Gold.
[time=3024] How much gold was he getting here?
[time=3026] - A little under a billion dollars, 800 million dollars a year.
[time=3029] - Yeah, I think Solomon blew past the warnings.
[time=3033] And if it wasn't the horses, it was the wives.
[time=3035] And it wasn't the wives, it was the gold.
[time=3038] God said don't, and he did.
[time=3040] And here's the deal about the wives.
[time=3043] Here's the deal about the 1,000 women.
[time=3046] They turned his heart away from God.
[time=3050] And I want to just remind you this morning.
[time=3054] You know, young men, young women, you know, older men, older women, all kinds of stages of life going on in here.
[time=3063] Some of you contemplating relationships with others.
[time=3068] And some of you contemplating business relationships.
[time=3071] I mean, relationships in general.
[time=3073] What you got to see from this is it doesn't take 1,000.
[time=3077] It could just take one to turn your heart away from what's true and right and good.
[time=3084] If you're thinking about a relationship this morning, great question for you to ask.
[time=3088] Does involvement with that individual heighten?
[time=3093] Sharpen increase your heart for God.
[time=3097] Or does it diminish it in some way?
[time=3100] Does it leave you distant or does it prompt you to grow?
[time=3104] Does a relationship, whatever relationship you might be considering, does it further that heart or does it like Solomon's wives turn your heart away because of the influences, because of the mindset?
[time=3119] You said something first hour I thought was really powerful.
[time=3122] Well, a parent here in Blackhawk that I really respect and I love his children and how they were maturing, he said to me one time, he said, "Hey, I asked my girls this question." I said, "I'm gonna judge the success of a relationship "with a boy, with you, on this.
[time=3146] "Does it improve your relationship with God?
[time=3159] "Does it improve your grades?
[time=3162] "Does it improve your athletics "or your extracurricular activities?" And I never forgot that.
[time=3170] And so I tell my girls, "Hey, I'm gonna judge "the context of any relationship with a guy on these things." And I also tell them, "Look, I really want you to think about "who, when, why, where, and how.
[time=3188] "You wanna be pursued by a guy "before there's ever an emotional connection." And I'm telling you that one little thing has saved us a couple times.
[time=3198] And I would just encourage you to take this and pass it along wherever you are because in many ways, this is what Solomon's saying.
[time=3209] He's saying, "I tried the alcohol thing.
[time=3211] "I tried the girl thing.
[time=3212] "You know, I tried gratifying via pleasure "in every way, shape, and form." And I did it apart from God.
[time=3220] And that's the risk of someone who's fully surrounded as life to Christ.
[time=3226] It's so subtly.
[time=3228] We can say, "I'll take that one step here." Just this one little click, just this one little glance, just this one little sip, and it's a step in the wrong direction.
[time=3243] - Let's talk about what we can learn.
[time=3247] Just big picture as we wrap this up.
[time=3249] - Well, life apart from God is meaningless.
[time=3251] I want you to write that down, it's on the screen.
[time=3253] Life apart from God is meaningless.
[time=3257] It's the first sin, it's the wide gate.
[time=3262] It's the love of this world, that which is opposed to God.
[time=3266] King Solomon pursued earthly knowledge for the sake of contentment, possessions for the sake of significance, military might for the sake of control, money for the sake of security, and pleasure for the sake of gratification, all apart from God.
[time=3282] Even though he had these tremendous encounters, this tremendous intimacy with the God of the universe, even though David's first words to Solomon, it's in Proverbs four, three through nine, he said, "Solomon, get wisdom, though it costs all you have, "I want you to get wisdom." Here it is, when I was a son of my father, tender, and the only son on the side of my mother, then he taught me, "David said this," and he said to me, "Let your heart hold fast, my words, "keep my commandments and live.
[time=3313] "Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding.
[time=3315] "Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth.
[time=3319] "Do not forsake her, and she will guard you, "love her, and she will watch over you.
[time=3323] "The beginning of wisdom is acquire wisdom, "and with all you're acquiring, get understanding.
[time=3329] "Pryse her, and she will exalt you.
[time=3330] "She will honor you if you embrace her.
[time=3333] "She will place on your head a garland of grace.
[time=3336] "She will present you with the crown of beauty, "and that's God's heart intersecting with my relationships." And you know what David's last words were to Solomon?
[time=3345] On his deathbed, it's in 1 Kings two verses one through four.
[time=3348] As David's time to die drew near, he charged Solomon, his son, saying, "I'm going the way of all the earth.
[time=3355] "Be strong, therefore, and show yourself a man.
[time=3358] "Keep charge of the Lord, your God, to walk in his ways, "to keep his statutes, his commandments, "his ordinances, and his testimonies.
[time=3365] "According to what is written in the law of Moses, "that you may succeed in all that you do, "and wherever you turn.
[time=3372] "So that the Lord may carry out his promise, "which he spoke concerning me, Solomon.
[time=3378] "Saying, if your sons are careful of their way, "to walk before me in truth, and all their heart, "and with all their soul, you shall not lack a man "on the throne of Israel." And God reinforced this to Solomon.
[time=3393] It's 1 Kings 9, 3 through 9, if you want to look at it when you go home.
[time=3397] God said these exact same thing, words to Solomon.
[time=3400] In Solomon, looking back on how he desired life apart from God and his last will in Testament, he said this in Ecclesiastes 12, verses 13 and 14, he said, "Now, the conclusion, "when all has been heard is fear God." That's not like be afraid of God.
[time=3421] There's two kinds of fear, it's not that.
[time=3424] It's a reverence for God.
[time=3425] It's like a son to his father, not like a slave to the master.
[time=3429] Revere God, love God, humble your heart to God, and keep his commandments, because this applies to every person.
[time=3439] For God will bring every act, Solomon's being pretty transparent here in Ecclesiastes.
[time=3445] He'll bring every act into judgment, everything which is hidden, whether it's good or evil.
[time=3451] Life apart from God is meaningless, but here's what I get from this.
[time=3456] God is always faithful, but we are not.
[time=3461] That's why we need Christ.
[time=3465] He allows us to pursue life with God.
[time=3468] He Christ brings us in communion with God.
[time=3472] Solomon wrote this in Ecclesiastes 3.11.
[time=3474] He Christ brings us in community with others, Ecclesiastes 4.12.
[time=3479] Christ never fails, and when we surrender to him, he will be with us always.
[time=3489] (upbeat music)
