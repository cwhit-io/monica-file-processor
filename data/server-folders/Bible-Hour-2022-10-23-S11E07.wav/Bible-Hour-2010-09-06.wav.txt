[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] [MUSIC - 42 seconds]
[time=78] For His returning.
[time=80] [MUSIC - 11 seconds]
[time=94] - Join in.
[time=95] [MUSIC - 73 seconds]
[time=173] [AMEN] (audience applauding) [AMEN] Hey, let me ask the greeters
[time=182] if they kind of make their way down and as they make their way down, I'm gonna ask Jonathan to kind of step up here and with your heads bowed and with your eyes closed, I wanna just take you 20 minutes back, okay?
[time=196] So where we first began this morning, and I wanna just ask Jonathan and our team here to just remind us of what a privilege it is to come into his presence.
[time=208] It's something you and I should be unspeakable thankful for.
[time=212] These words that we sang apply to every person in this room, doesn't matter who you are or where you've been, what a privilege for us to be able to come into his presence as is Jonathan.
[time=227] [MUSIC - 58 seconds]
[time=290] - This morning, I can't wait for you to hear the message
[time=298] that God has put on Corbin's heart.
[time=302] Tried to get him to use a pulpit, but he's gonna use a music stand.
[time=308] I sing a solo, and you're gonna use a music stand.
[time=312] - Hey.
[time=313] - No, this is really something I've been looking forward to.
[time=315] We meet every week, and it's one of the things I look forward to each week, and a couple of weeks ago, I got to hear kind of what God has put on Corbin's heart this morning.
[time=324] I just can't tell you enough how thankful I am for his willingness to do this.
[time=328] I hope you listen.
[time=329] I hope you just open your hearts and minds this morning.
[time=332] I think it's gonna really be encouraging for you.
[time=334] So, Black Hawk, welcome for Pastor Corbin Miller.
[time=337] (audience applauding) - I must say, I was pleasantly surprised
[time=346] with how that last half an hour went.
[time=348] Makes me so nervous.
[time=349] I didn't know if I was gonna sit up there and be at peace and ready to share from the word of God, or if I was gonna be jittery and anxious because the band was gonna fall apart, or Kelly was gonna say something that he'd regret, or who knows.
[time=361] You did good, I'd have to say wow.
[time=364] Really.
[time=365] (audience applauding) Really good.
[time=368] It was meaningful for me to just sit and be led.
[time=374] I hope it was for you too.
[time=375] All summer long, we've been in this series about real people that experienced some amazing things in the word of God, and you'll see right in the middle above the letter E sits my pick, Asaph.
[time=390] Some of you might be wondering who in the world Asaph is.
[time=392] My apologies to all the kids in the room who last week tried to figure out who I was gonna preach on, and the clues didn't make sense.
[time=400] I don't know if anybody, kids did anybody win the prize last week for picking, I'm so glad, because Janice called me up and she's like, how am I supposed to get kids to figure out who Asaph is?
[time=409] I don't even know who Asaph is.
[time=411] (audience laughing) I picked Asaph because he's a little bit obscure, and so am I.
[time=416] I also picked Asaph because he's a worship leader and a songwriter, and so am I.
[time=422] I also picked Asaph because he had 128 descendants, and I'm well on my way to doing the exact same thing.
[time=430] I don't know if it'll get to 128, but we've got a lot of similarities.
[time=434] For those of you that don't know, in the book of songs, there's actually several writers.
[time=439] Most of the songs were all written by King David, or Shepherd Boy David, same guy, just different face of life.
[time=447] But there's another guy that kind of rises to the surface as a songwriter that's pretty well known in his name's Asaph, well known in the sense that a lot of songs were attributed to him, 12, to be exact.
[time=460] Most of the songs in that book are just anonymous.
[time=463] We just simply don't know who wrote them, but Asaph wrote Psalm 73 to 83, and then he also wrote Psalm 50 for a grand total of 12 songs.
[time=472] Now he probably wrote more than that, but those are at least the ones that have been canonized or kept in our Bible.
[time=479] So this morning, I thought about taking you through all 12 of them, but it's gonna take forever.
[time=485] So we'll just do one, but we won't even do that quite yet, 'cause I want you to know better about who Asaph is.
[time=493] So I'm gonna move through a couple of places in the Old Testament that refer to Asaph, and I'm gonna do it fast.
[time=500] And if you wanna chase after me in your Bibles, you're more than welcome to.
[time=504] If you wanna just see it pop up on the screen, it's certainly fine with me also.
[time=508] We're gonna look at Asaph's role in two particular worship services, and then we're gonna find out what King Hezekiah had to say about Asaph before we look at the songs that he wrote.
[time=519] Everybody with me so far?
[time=520] Okay.
[time=521] I talk fast, and the choir warned me not to talk too fast for this particular engagement.
[time=527] Okay, so the first thing I wanna do PowerPoint is get up first Chronicles 15.
[time=533] And in first Chronicles 15, it's the first time we learned about Asaph in his role as a worship leader.
[time=539] Before we read it, first Chronicles 15 is a big worship service where Israel was all invited into the city Jerusalem, where King David was, because they were excited that the Ark of the Covenant was no longer gonna be in some obscure town, but now it was coming to the capital city.
[time=558] And if you read chapters 13, 14, and 15 of first Chronicles on your own time, you'll see why they're so excited about this particular event.
[time=567] Now in first Chronicles 15, this is also where David started dancing really wild and crazy, and he actually like disrobed part of his clothing in front of the whole kingdom and he passionately danced for the Lord and his wife got embarrassed.
[time=581] This is all happening in first Chronicles 15.
[time=585] But toward the beginning or the middle rather, first Chronicles chapter 15, 16, and 17 says this.
[time=591] David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers to sing joyful songs accompanied by musical instruments, liars, harps, and cymbals.
[time=603] So the Levites appointed actually a whole bunch of people, among them would be Asaph, son of Barakiah.
[time=610] This is the Asaph that wrote the Psalm that we're gonna talk about in just a minute.
[time=615] So you wanna learn a little bit about Asaph, you wanna see what he experienced.
[time=619] He was there when that amazing day happened in Jerusalem, that ark was brought in.
[time=623] He was there when David danced passionately before the Lord.
[time=627] He was there in the midst of all of it.
[time=630] He was there for first Chronicles 15, 29 where David's wife Michael, my kids think that's hysterical, that David married a girl named Michael.
[time=640] First Chronicles 15, 29.
[time=642] As the ark of the covenant of the Lord was entering the city of David, Michael, daughter of Saul, actually she was a gift to David, watched from the window.
[time=653] And when she saw King David dancing and celebrating, she despised him in her heart.
[time=659] So Asaph's perspective was different than Michael's.
[time=664] Michael was there watching David dance.
[time=665] Asaph was there watching David dance too.
[time=670] Okay, there's another worship service that Asaph got to be a part of.
[time=674] And Asaph actually wasn't just there under King David's reign, but he was also there under his sons, King Solomon's reign as well.
[time=682] So if you fast forward to second Chronicles chapter five, you'll see Asaph there again when the ark of the covenant now was brought from just being an attempt into the temple.
[time=694] If you were here last week, you heard Mitch and Kelly talk about King Solomon's temple and how it was glorious and how it took them seven years to build it.
[time=704] And this was the day where they were finally gonna bring the ark of the covenant into that temple.
[time=709] So Asaph was there.
[time=710] Let's read together second Chronicles chapter five verses 12 through 14.
[time=716] All the Levites who were musicians Asaph, the guy we're talking about, He-Man.
[time=723] I don't know if that's the correct pronunciation or not, but that's the one I prefer.
[time=727] Jettathon and their sons and relatives, they all stood on the east side of the altar.
[time=735] They were dressed in fine linen and were playing symbols, harps and liars.
[time=738] So imagine Asaph on the east side of the altar.
[time=742] They were accompanied by 120 priest sounding trumpets.
[time=747] We oftentimes have three trumpets on our stage and they're pretty loud.
[time=752] I can't imagine 120 of them.
[time=755] What a loud celebration.
[time=756] The trumpeters and singers joined in unison as with one voice to give praise and thanks to the Lord.
[time=763] If you worship with us regularly, we sing a song often that starts, [MUSIC - 3 seconds] This is the ancient day that we sing about.
[time=774] Second Chronicles chapter five.
[time=775] Let's see what happened.
[time=777] They raised their voices in praise to the Lord and they sang [MUSIC]
[time=784] [MUSIC]
[time=786] The song we sing just paraphrases the scripture that says He is good, is love and doers forever.
[time=792] Then the temple of the Lord was filled with the cloud and the priests couldn't even perform their service because of the cloud.
[time=799] Imagine Asaph off to the east side and he had a job to do and he couldn't even do it because the glory of the Lord was coming down.
[time=806] For the glory of the Lord filled the temple of God.
[time=810] Asaph experienced God in a pretty unique and powerful way in second Chronicles chapter five.
[time=816] I wanna show you something else we learned about Asaph later on in second Chronicles.
[time=823] This is a while later, King Hezekiah is now in charge, not King Solomon anymore.
[time=829] Asaph is dead and Hezekiah is reorienting the people to how to worship in the temple and he says this in second Chronicles 29 verse 30.
[time=839] King Hezekiah and his officials, they ordered the Levites to praise the Lord with the words of David and of Asaph the seer.
[time=849] So King Hezekiah said, guys, let's model our worship service after what David and Asaph used to do.
[time=857] So this does two things in my mind.
[time=859] One, it elevates Asaph's songs to a higher level 'cause we know that David was a man after God's own heart.
[time=865] We know that David had a lot of songs in the book of Psalms and now Asaph is on that same category according to King Hezekiah.
[time=873] And then as Hezekiah says this other thing about Asaph that I think is intriguing that we need to understand.
[time=879] He says Asaph is a seer.
[time=882] And it's not a word that we use very often.
[time=885] So I think we should understand a little bit of what the word seer means.
[time=891] I'll need a little bit of help from everybody in the room.
[time=893] We're gonna learn the Hebrew word for seer.
[time=897] I looked it up on the internet and it says that it's Hosea.
[time=901] Can you say Hosea?
[time=905] And if you need to wipe the spit on the back of your neck from the person behind you that you said, Hosea, I'll certainly understand.
[time=912] You probably won't ever say that word again so let's just do it again together.
[time=915] Ready, Hosea?
[time=917] Thank you.
[time=918] It means seer and it's a specific type of seer that's used right here in Second Chronicles, chapter 29.
[time=926] The definition is this.
[time=928] One who sees a vision, not with the eye of sense but with the spiritual and intellectual faculties.
[time=938] In other words, it's not that Hosea looked and he saw somebody as plain as I see you.
[time=945] He saw it in his heart, he saw it in his mind.
[time=947] It was a vision that he had from God.
[time=950] And honestly, everybody that wrote anything in this Bible was some sort of a seer because we know that ultimately these are God's words and we know that God inspired people to write them, they're written by humans but these words are inspired by the Holy Spirit.
[time=968] So everybody that wrote anything in this book is some sort of Hosea.
[time=973] It's some sort of seer that God gave them a picture, not with their eyes but with their hearts and their minds and it caused them to write like crazy and we haven't preserved.
[time=982] It's what makes this book so special.
[time=984] It wouldn't be a special book if people just wrote it.
[time=988] It's special because it's divinely inspired.
[time=991] So Asaph is a seer according to Hezekiah.
[time=995] And actually if you looked at all 12 rather of Isaiah's Psalms, remember it's Psalm 50 as well as Psalm 73 through 83, if you read those and I challenge you to, they're very compelling.
[time=1008] Did I do that?
[time=1009] Sorry.
[time=1010] You'll find that Asaph quotes God a lot
[time=1016] and he actually is writing songs that God sang to him.
[time=1020] It's very fascinating.
[time=1021] Hi Bella.
[time=1023] How are you sweetie?
[time=1024] Do you need to help find your mom?
[time=1027] I think she might.
[time=1029] Hey, Shannon's right back there.
[time=1032] Can you go get her?
[time=1033] Say hi to everybody.
[time=1034] It's fine.
[time=1036] It could have happened to any of us.
[time=1038] You need to go see your mommy.
[time=1042] Anybody else want to join us?
[time=1050] (audience clapping) Too funny.
[time=1057] I'm glad I knew who Isabella was.
[time=1059] What was I saying?
[time=1063] I can't remember.
[time=1064] Oh Asaph was writing songs that God sang to him
[time=1072] because Asaph is writing songs in direct quotes.
[time=1076] Actually Psalm 50 and 82 are nearly entirely direct quotes from God.
[time=1081] Isn't that fascinating?
[time=1082] Can you imagine sitting there and hearing God sing a song to you and so you start to write it down and not only the words, but the tune and the rhythm and the melody?
[time=1092] I just can't imagine what that was like for Asaph.
[time=1095] I wish we could know the tune of God's songs.
[time=1097] Asaph at least shows us the words.
[time=1100] Okay, today we're gonna look at Psalm 50.
[time=1106] I narrowed it down to Psalm 50 because Psalm 50 is about worship and I think there's some really compelling things for us to learn in there.
[time=1114] If you wanna turn in your Bibles, we're gonna camp in Psalm 50 for a little while, but we're not gonna get there quite yet because I wanna talk a little bit about worship.
[time=1123] Worship is kind of a difficult word to understand
[time=1129] in the Hebrew and in the Greek when they translate it into English as the word worship.
[time=1136] The Hebrew and Greek words are really bizarre.
[time=1138] They actually mean to genuflect or lean toward or to kiss the hand of or to be in awe or reverence.
[time=1147] And so they're kind of obscure definitions.
[time=1151] And so I wondered today if we could just take some time instead of defining worship, I'd rather describe it to you.
[time=1158] I think that that'll prove better in the long run 'cause worship is a really big word.
[time=1163] Actually, before we describe it together, I wondered if you could kind of group up with some people close beside you today.
[time=1169] And if you could, in your own words, just describe to your friends and the people around you, what is worship?
[time=1177] Talk a little bit about that question.
[time=1178] What is worship?
[time=1180] Okay.
[time=1193] Did anybody have any good descriptions of worship that surfaced and could you shout them out toward me?
[time=1200] Say it again.
[time=1202] Faith?
[time=1204] Thanks.
[time=1209] Thanks for that.
[time=1212] Yeah, thanks, good.
[time=1213] What else is worship?
[time=1214] Praise, singing.
[time=1217] What else?
[time=1220] Celebration?
[time=1223] I won't hear all of these, but this will help me.
[time=1226] What else?
[time=1227] Adoration?
[time=1229] Bending the knee of your heart.
[time=1235] I like that.
[time=1237] I might need to save that one for over here.
[time=1239] You'll see why.
[time=1240] Good.
[time=1244] Thanks for hollering those out.
[time=1246] I hope your discussions were interesting.
[time=1248] I wanted to tell you before we talk more.
[time=1250] I read a book by Kathleen Campbell this summer called Teaching Kids, Authentic Worship, which I thought was good.
[time=1257] Since my titles are worship leader, and since I have kids, I thought it would be a good book to read.
[time=1262] In her introductory pages, I underlined and circled and starred the places where she said this.
[time=1268] I'm more convinced than ever that worship is the most misunderstood word in the religious world.
[time=1276] It's overused, misused, and sometimes abused.
[time=1280] And I agree with her because I've always struggled to help people understand all that worship is.
[time=1288] In particular, musicians, especially since I'm a music pastor, singing often comes up when we talk about worship.
[time=1295] I mean, we're kind of products of our culture in that regard right now.
[time=1298] Our culture has a genre of music that's called worship music.
[time=1302] And so, I mean, how could we not think about that?
[time=1305] And in some ways, that's a benefit, which I'll explain later.
[time=1308] But yeah, worship is really this broad umbrella.
[time=1312] It's this broad category.
[time=1314] There's my umbrella.
[time=1317] It's this broad category that includes all the things you mentioned, thanks and praise and celebration, adoration.
[time=1324] When David danced before the Lord, that was an act of worship.
[time=1328] Anything that makes God smile is kind of a simple way that I like to define worship.
[time=1335] Praying can be a form of worship.
[time=1341] Collecting ties and offerings can be a form of worship.
[time=1343] Having a preacher stand up here and open up the Bible and talk about it can be a form of worship.
[time=1349] It's a really broad category.
[time=1351] And something that's sad to me is that we've often equated the category with the type.
[time=1358] We've talked about worship and singing synonymously.
[time=1362] And I'm afraid that that's gonna be an unhealthy thing in our future as a church.
[time=1366] Think of a completely different illustration.
[time=1370] If we were talking about another category like sports, there would be all sorts of types that would fall under that category.
[time=1378] You know many of them, football, baseball, basketball, water polo, voluge, cheerleading.
[time=1386] The list goes on and on and on and on and on.
[time=1389] But nobody would ever say, let's go play sports and automatically think water polo.
[time=1397] It's just when it happened.
[time=1399] But somehow we say the category of worship in people automatically think singing.
[time=1405] Not all of you said that, and so I'm glad.
[time=1407] We're moving into a healthy understanding of this word.
[time=1412] Doing this, calling the type, a category, calling singing worship can be beneficial.
[time=1418] Cheerleading, for instance, I don't think was always considered a sport, nothing against cheerleaders, but I think in an attempt to esteem what they do and value what they do and say that it's good and better, they called it a sport instead of associating it with like anything else.
[time=1439] They said, let's identify this type and let's emphasize it by calling it the category.
[time=1445] And that's what happened with music in the church, I think, in the last several decades.
[time=1450] For a long time, churches in America, we were just singing.
[time=1453] And it wasn't all that it could be.
[time=1456] And so I think the church would say, no, let's not sing, let's worship.
[time=1461] And they would emphasize and elevate the type to this category.
[time=1465] And so some of it's really good, and I don't want anybody to walk away thinking that I don't like to be called a worship pastor or that I don't like to say we lead worship.
[time=1474] 'Cause I'm really okay with that.
[time=1476] There's just a problem when everybody says, let's go play sports and they just think of pom poms and cheerleading.
[time=1482] You know what I'm saying?
[time=1483] There's a problem when we say, let's go worship and everybody just thinks sing a song.
[time=1487] And actually, this definition is really more about acts
[time=1493] of worship than it is worship in and of itself.
[time=1497] And this is all brand new to me as in the last couple of weeks.
[time=1500] When I've been reading books and studying for this message, I feel like God really helped me understand this.
[time=1505] I defined worship like this or described worship like this for a really long time.
[time=1510] And just as of a couple of weeks ago, I've kind of changed the way I describe it.
[time=1515] Now, think of worship as a solar system.
[time=1520] And this description isn't negating the umbrella,
[time=1526] it's in addition to the umbrella, just so you know.
[time=1529] What do we know about the solar system?
[time=1533] There are a gazillion of solar systems in the universe today.
[time=1539] Every solar system has a sun, right?
[time=1543] And then every sun or star gives off heat and it has a gravitational pull.
[time=1549] So anything that might be orbiting around the sun, if that sun would go away, then all of a sudden, whatever's swarming around it, like a planet or an asteroid or whatever swarms around the sun, I don't even know.
[time=1563] That thing would freeze because the star is its source of heat and it would lose its gravitational pull.
[time=1570] If the sun goes away, that planet just spins off into oblivion.
[time=1575] If we didn't have a sun, everything on the earth would be ice and actually we would just fly off into oblivion until we bumped into a new star that had a new gravitational pull that would help us swarm around.
[time=1588] And everybody tracking with what we know kind of about a solar system?
[time=1591] Well, I like to say now that inside everybody's heart
[time=1598] is some sort of solar system and this is a type of worship.
[time=1602] It's not an act of worship, but it's an attitude of worship.
[time=1605] And so inside all of our hearts is some sort of attitude
[time=1611] in regard to worship and I call it a solar system because something is going to rise to the top as being most important in each of us.
[time=1621] My question for you today is what's the sun of your heart's solar system today?
[time=1627] Whatever that is, is what you worship.
[time=1631] So I believe because the Bible tells me that God is to be the solar system of my heart and your heart, that that's the best possible solution for success in this life and the next.
[time=1644] And I'm not just talking about God in general, I'm talking about God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, the three in one blessed Trinity.
[time=1651] If you wanna talk about some other God that doesn't involve Jesus or the Holy Spirit, then I'm not interested in agreeing with you because this is a special God, the God of the Bible that's gotten three persons.
[time=1664] Anyway, so if God's in his proper place in our hearts, then we're ready and teed up for this attitude of worship and whatever else is good and right in our lives should stay in our hearts if it's sin, it needs to go away.
[time=1679] But if there's something good and right in our lives, it needs to be a planet and not the Son.
[time=1686] It's kind of like idolatry.
[time=1690] You know, we talked about that a lot together as a church last year.
[time=1693] There are good things in life.
[time=1694] I can't draw them all up here, but family is a really good thing.
[time=1699] Your spouse and your kids, it's a great planet that should stay in your heart.
[time=1704] Money and wealth and things that we have.
[time=1712] Aren't necessarily sin, but they should stay in our hearts and they should orbit around God.
[time=1716] Or our jobs should be there, that's really good.
[time=1720] Or our hobbies, for me, music, you know, should be in there, but just in its proper place.
[time=1726] The hard part church is trying to figure out what has the position of son.
[time=1731] For me, when I was growing up, it was about five years of age that I became really, really passionate about music.
[time=1743] And I would wake up every morning and I would think about music and I had a piano and I wanted to learn how to play every other instrument and I saved up money and I bought a keyboard and I saved up more money and I bought CDs and I bought song books and I would sing all the time.
[time=1759] I was the definition of a music dork, for sure.
[time=1762] But music dorks can often land better jobs than non-music dorks, so just point taking there.
[time=1770] But other things were really important to me but they all centered around music.
[time=1774] Like I would wake up thinking about music and I'd go to school and I'd do my homework but in the back of my mind I was thinking about music and I couldn't wait for choir class in band class.
[time=1783] I don't know how I didn't get beat up before I graduated from high school.
[time=1787] And I was just excited about music all the time.
[time=1790] I couldn't stop thinking about it.
[time=1792] I was obsessed with music.
[time=1794] I worshiped music.
[time=1796] It was really important to me and I feel like at one point in my growing up years if I would have lost a hand or if I would have been mute, my world would have frozen and spun out into oblivion because my world was music.
[time=1815] And without my hands and without my voice I couldn't have my world.
[time=1819] The hard part with worship is you think that God is the sun
[time=1825] but often he's mercury and he's really revolving around what's most important to you instead of being what's most important to you.
[time=1835] And the really hard part is you don't know until whatever you put in the middle goes away.
[time=1841] And if music goes away then you get to learn what my priorities are.
[time=1847] I can't help but look at the three of you right here.
[time=1850] Steve and Joe and Diana.
[time=1852] And maybe your spouses were the sun and he didn't know it until God took him away.
[time=1860] But I'm so glad that all three of you were right there because I don't know if your spouses were your son or not.
[time=1867] If they were then God quick took another stab at being the sun and if they weren't he was your son from the start but you're here and you love him and you're testifying that he is good even now with different spouses.
[time=1881] I just think that's incredible.
[time=1884] So my question for you today is what's your son?
[time=1887] I hope God is your son and I hope that your test on what your son is is never too painful.
[time=1893] Okay.
[time=1897] We're looking together at Psalm 50.
[time=1902] This was all just precursory to get us to Psalm 50 because Asaph talks about Psalm 50 and when he talks about worship I don't want you to think singing.
[time=1910] And when he talks about worship I don't want you to think fasting.
[time=1914] I want you to think of all of this combined.
[time=1916] Did you know that the Bible says singing can be bad?
[time=1919] God says that our songs can be obnoxious.
[time=1923] Did you know that there are things in the Bible that say that praying and fasting can be bad?
[time=1929] Jesus preached about it in the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=1931] He said if you fast this way or if you pray this way it's an offense to me.
[time=1936] So they have to be combined together.
[time=1938] You have to do these things with the right attitude and put them together.
[time=1943] That's what Asaph talks about too.
[time=1944] Okay.
[time=1946] Psalm 50.
[time=1947] At the beginning Asaph establishes a scenario.
[time=1953] He sees a vision, not with his eyes but with his heart and with his mind.
[time=1956] And the vision is this.
[time=1957] God has come to judge the world.
[time=1961] Not everybody in the world just his special chosen people.
[time=1964] So let's look at this together.
[time=1966] The mighty one, God the Lord speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to the place where it sets.
[time=1975] From Zion, perfect and beauty.
[time=1977] God shines for our God comes and he will not be silent.
[time=1982] A fire devours before him and around him a tempest rages.
[time=1987] He summons the heavens above and the earth below that he may judge his people.
[time=1994] Here's God singing.
[time=1996] Gather to me my consecrated ones who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
[time=2001] In the heavens proclaim his righteousness for God himself is judge.
[time=2006] Say la.
[time=2006] So Asaph is setting up a picture of a courtroom for lack of a better term.
[time=2014] God's the judge.
[time=2016] His consecrated people.
[time=2017] The ones that he chose.
[time=2018] The ones that he brought from the womb of Sarah.
[time=2021] The ones that he raised up in Egypt.
[time=2024] The ones that he brought out of Egypt.
[time=2025] And then he wandered them in the desert and brought them into the Promised Land.
[time=2029] Those are the people that he's about to judge.
[time=2032] Not the nations.
[time=2033] 'Cause he says in verse five.
[time=2034] Gather to me my consecrated ones.
[time=2037] Now there are also witnesses involved.
[time=2040] I just think this is interesting.
[time=2042] Asaph talks about witnesses.
[time=2044] But if you think about a courtroom, it's not a jury box and it's not God calling somebody to the stand.
[time=2049] That's not the type of witness he's talking about.
[time=2052] 'Cause you'll see later that God doesn't need any evidence on what the people do 'cause he knows the bad choices the people have made.
[time=2060] And what happens here, the witnesses just kind of watch from the sideline and they just watch God be judge and they stand in awe and wonder of him.
[time=2069] So Asaph sets it up.
[time=2072] He got a courtroom and God's gonna sing in verse seven.
[time=2076] Some judgment.
[time=2077] Verse seven.
[time=2080] Oh, let me back up.
[time=2081] I wanted to tell you this too.
[time=2083] In verse seven in this next chunk, he's gonna talk about one type of bad worship.
[time=2087] And then starting in verse 16, he's gonna transition to another type of bad worship.
[time=2091] It's a song about bad worship.
[time=2093] We don't sing enough songs about bad worship.
[time=2096] So the two types are this.
[time=2097] One is heartless and you'll see Asaph describe a detached in different mechanical style of worship.
[time=2103] And then later he transitions into hypocritical worship.
[time=2108] And for you kids in the room, you might not know that word hypocritical and the best way I can think to describe hypocritical is a pretender.
[time=2117] So we're gonna talk about detached worshipers and pretending worshipers.
[time=2122] The first one is a heartless worshiper.
[time=2126] In verse seven, God sings.
[time=2128] Here are my people and I will speak.
[time=2132] Oh, Israel and I will testify against you.
[time=2135] I am God.
[time=2136] You're God.
[time=2138] Again, just notice who he's talking to.
[time=2140] It's not the world.
[time=2142] It's the Israelites.
[time=2143] It's the church, if you will, not exactly, but we can kind of place ourselves back in time for when this song was sung.
[time=2153] Look at verse nine, eight, excuse me.
[time=2156] I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings, which are ever before me.
[time=2164] He's saying this, your acts of worship are there.
[time=2167] Your umbrella is in place.
[time=2169] You've got your offerings.
[time=2170] You've got all of the things that you're giving me, your sacrifices, it's there.
[time=2174] That's not why I'm rebuking you.
[time=2175] Here's why I'm rebuking you, verse nine.
[time=2177] I have no need of a bull from your stall or of goats from your pens.
[time=2183] For every animal in the forest is mine.
[time=2186] My commentaries that I read said, God gets a little bit sarcastic in these verses.
[time=2189] So I'm gonna try to read it a little bit sarcastically.
[time=2193] God says every animal in the forest is mine in the cattle on a thousand hills.
[time=2197] I know every bird in the mountains and the creatures of the field are mine.
[time=2201] If I were hungry, I would not tell you for the world is mine and all that is in it.
[time=2207] I do not, do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?
[time=2213] And so God's kind of looking at him and saying, "Yeah, thanks for the acts of worship, "but you think you're sustaining me by them.
[time=2220] "I can't be sustained.
[time=2221] "I'm the self-sustaining one.
[time=2224] "I'm not hungry for the meat.
[time=2225] "I'm not thirsty for the blood.
[time=2227] "I want something more." So let's find out what God wants more.
[time=2231] Look at verse 14.
[time=2233] He says, "Do this instead.
[time=2235] "Sacrifice thank offerings to God.
[time=2238] "Fulfill your vows to the most high "and call upon me in the day of trouble.
[time=2243] "I would deliver you and you will honor me." There's four things in those verses that make me think of our solar system.
[time=2253] God wants the hearts of his people in those four verses.
[time=2257] He says, "One, sacrifice thanks offerings to God." My question for you this morning, how's your gratitude level?
[time=2266] How thankful to God are you for the things that you have, for the blessings in your life?
[time=2271] How thankful are you?
[time=2274] The other thing that's a heart indicator, God says fulfill your vows to the most high.
[time=2279] He wants his people to have integrity.
[time=2281] Integrity is a huge form of worship.
[time=2284] Are you gonna do what you promised to do to others?
[time=2287] But even specifically, in Psalm 50, God says fulfill your vows to me to the most high.
[time=2293] Have you promised God that you were gonna do something that you never actually did?
[time=2297] True heart worship would have the integrity to follow through on the promise made to God.
[time=2304] Verse 15, "And call upon me in the day of trouble." God's singing this to his people.
[time=2311] God's singing this to you this morning.
[time=2313] I think this is so precious.
[time=2315] God says, "I don't want your goats.
[time=2316] "I don't want your bulls.
[time=2318] "Just when things go bad, think of me.
[time=2321] "When you have a really hard day, "would you call on me for help?
[time=2325] "Would you stop looking to your own resources "to solve your problems?
[time=2329] "Instead, would you just pray to me "and ask me to deliver you?" I love that about God.
[time=2334] And then at the end of 15, the fourth thing, "I will deliver you," says God.
[time=2340] "And you will honor me." Honor is a huge part of a good attitude of worship.
[time=2346] So in those passages, we see that bad worship is heartless.
[time=2352] And I know that for me, and for all of you, when we have bad hearts, we tend toward heartless worship.
[time=2361] And the problem here with the Israelites, and the problem here with us, and the problem here with me is that we've got a bad heart, and we need a new one.
[time=2369] The other form of worship that's bad is hypocritical or pretender worship.
[time=2377] So let's look at that together.
[time=2379] Before we get into it, I just wanna tell you a story about hypocrisy that was kind of interesting.
[time=2388] To me, I sat down with coffee with a guy from my church and a friend of his and the friend, and I were meeting for the first time.
[time=2395] She knew I was from the church, and so she just said right away, "I'm not a Christian, just so you know." I thought, "Great, I am, just so you know." And so we started talking.
[time=2406] And she was talking to me about how she tries to bring up her sons with some moral understanding.
[time=2413] And I don't know where she based her moral compass, but she tried to instill in them some good behaviors.
[time=2419] And she said, "I've got a problem.
[time=2421] "My older son is dating this Christian girl, "but her moral standards are in the tank.
[time=2426] "Compared to my sons who grew up without Jesus, "they've got way better morals than this Christian girl.
[time=2434] "And so what I told her and what I'm gonna describe to you "is that we've got a problem in our country.
[time=2440] "We've got a lot of people that wear a name tag "that says Christian, and so they go around "associating themselves with Jesus and with Christ "and with the church, and they say I'm a Christian, "but they really truly deep down in their hearts, aren't.
[time=2458] "They don't follow Jesus.
[time=2459] "Their life isn't any different than it used to be.
[time=2462] "They just kind of grabbed the name tag, and that was it." Now, I could do all sorts of name tags, and it wouldn't make the name tag true about who I am.
[time=2474] Earlier in the week, I walked out of my offices in Michelle, Michelle's my assistant.
[time=2478] What's a list of things that I'm really bad at?
[time=2481] And she was really kind of taken aback and kind of laughed a little bit.
[time=2485] She said, "I've never quite had a job description like that." But she came up with a really good list, and it was kind of too long for us to go into today.
[time=2495] One thing she said is, "Corbin, you're bad "at being computer savvy." So that's my hypocritical name tag there, just 'cause I carry a Mac doesn't mean that I know how to use it.
[time=2508] The other thing she mentioned was athletics.
[time=2512] Just because I wear a name tag that says I'm athletic, if I get on the basketball court and I try to prove that to you, you'll know in about 30 seconds how not athletic.
[time=2524] I am, another one she mentioned was a car mechanic.
[time=2527] Again, I said the list goes on and on.
[time=2529] I can wear the name tag, but if you bring me your Jeep or your BMW, I will just hand it off to somebody else because I don't know what to do with those.
[time=2538] I can put gasoline in them.
[time=2540] I can take it to Jiffy Lube, and that's about it.
[time=2543] So this is how I think of hypocrisy or how I think of pretenders.
[time=2549] People that wear the name tag, but at their true core, they're not really that thing.
[time=2555] Just because I say I'm a mechanic or a computer savvy or a Christian doesn't make me those things until I can prove it with my actions.
[time=2566] So let's go back to Psalm 50 with that definition in mind and God through ASAP is gonna share what he thinks about hypocritical pretend worshipers.
[time=2576] Verse 16, but to the wicked God says,
[time=2583] what right have you to recite my laws or take my covenant on your lips?
[time=2586] You hate my instruction and cast my words behind you.
[time=2590] And just so we're all on the same page.
[time=2594] Right at the beginning, it says, but to the wicked.
[time=2596] When I first read it, I thought, oh, it's a brand new audience.
[time=2599] He's not talking to the Christians anymore.
[time=2603] Now he's talking to the world, but he's really not because of two things.
[time=2607] In that very verse, he says, you recite my laws.
[time=2610] You take my covenant on your lips.
[time=2612] These are people that know the Bible.
[time=2614] And when you look back at verse five, when God initially got this courtroom drama going on, he said, bring to me my consecrated ones.
[time=2623] He didn't say, bring to me those who don't know anything about my covenant.
[time=2628] He said, bring the covenant people.
[time=2630] And so that makes the wicked verse a little scarier because God says, you say you're with me, but you're not.
[time=2638] You are wicked.
[time=2640] Look at verse 18, we'll see what these people did, even though they took the law on their lips, even though they wore the name tag that said, I'm with God.
[time=2650] This is what they did, verse 18.
[time=2653] When you see a thief, you join him.
[time=2657] And then you throw your lot in with adulterers.
[time=2659] You use your mouth for evil and you harness your tongue to deceit.
[time=2665] I like that word picture.
[time=2667] You speak continually against your brother and you slander your own mother's son.
[time=2673] They were liars, they were slanderers, they were adulterers, they were thieves, but they still had the name tag that said, I'm gods.
[time=2687] Something that you should notice, those four things are all reflective of the 10 commandments.
[time=2694] And what happens in poetic literature is, a lot of times they'll reference four little things to represent the whole law.
[time=2703] And so if you thought today, oh, I haven't committed adultery, I haven't stolen and I don't even have a brother, so I can't slander him.
[time=2710] You're not exempt because those four little things represent the entire law or everything that you could ever possibly do to sin against God.
[time=2718] If you continue in a pattern of doing sinful things, after you wear the name tag, you're now a pretender, you're a hypocrite.
[time=2726] This is what God says in verse 21.
[time=2731] These things you have done and I kept silent.
[time=2734] You thought I was altogether like you, but I will rebuke you and accuse you to your face.
[time=2744] You know, God is silent a lot.
[time=2747] And sometimes we misunderstand his silence for approval.
[time=2752] You did these things and I kept silent.
[time=2756] You thought I was altogether like you.
[time=2758] These people were really misled.
[time=2761] Just because God's silent toward your sin today doesn't mean that you get away with it.
[time=2766] Don't ever misunderstand God's patience for repentance.
[time=2772] Sometimes he's quiet 'cause he's just patiently waiting for us to change.
[time=2777] Don't ever confuse that silence with approval of your sin.
[time=2781] He's not approving.
[time=2783] He wrote us a whole Bible that says that when we sin, it's a problem and he is not down with sin.
[time=2789] He is firmly against it.
[time=2792] So let me just share this with you.
[time=2795] God wants our genuine authenticity.
[time=2798] He doesn't want pretenders.
[time=2800] He doesn't want hypocrites.
[time=2802] He doesn't want a phony.
[time=2803] He doesn't want a plaster saint or a fraud.
[time=2807] Jesus said it this way.
[time=2808] He doesn't want a clean cup on the outside, but with greedy selfishness on the inside.
[time=2814] He doesn't want a dish that's clean on the outside and then self-indulgent inside, or a whitewashed tomb that's clean on the outside, but on the inside is full of dead man's bones.
[time=2825] So there's a problem.
[time=2828] Just like before, the problem with heartless worship is a bad heart.
[time=2832] The problem with pretender worship is a bad heart.
[time=2835] So we need a solution.
[time=2838] We need a heart solution.
[time=2839] And I'm thankful that Asaph, I wonder if he knew it at the time, points us to Jesus.
[time=2846] At the end of Psalm 50, the last couple verses, you might not notice it at first, but Asaph's talking about Jesus.
[time=2855] I don't think he knew it, to be honest.
[time=2857] Verse 22 says, consider this you who forget God, or I will tear you to pieces with none to rescue.
[time=2863] I love the Psalms.
[time=2865] Only in the Psalms do they tear people to pieces.
[time=2868] It's such a unique book of the Bible.
[time=2871] I'm tear you to pieces, but then verse 23 says, "He who sacrifices thank offerings honors me, and he prepares the way so that I may show in the salvation of God the salvation of God, the rescue of God." The previous verse said, "There's none that will rescue you." In the next verse it says, "I'm gonna rescue you." What do we do with that?
[time=2894] These verses seem really opposite.
[time=2895] Verse 22 is the justice of God.
[time=2899] I will tear you to pieces, none will rescue you.
[time=2902] Sometimes we think that God overlooks sin, and he kinda sweeps it under the rug, and he says, "Let's just pretend like that never happened, and you can come be my friend, and you can come be in my family, because I'm gracious, or I'm forgiving." That's not true.
[time=2918] God says every sin has to be paid for.
[time=2921] He doesn't pretend that it doesn't exist, and verse 22 reminds us he will tear sin to pieces.
[time=2926] There will be none to rescue sinners." Well, he doesn't say it, none to rescue.
[time=2932] Verse 23 then he shows his compassion inside, and he says, "He who sacrifices thank offerings, I'm gonna show him my salvation, I'm gonna show him my rescue." And it's in the person of Jesus that we see the wrath of God satisfied, and we see the salvation and compassion of God come together.
[time=2955] With God in the person of Jesus, he put the weight of verse 22, the weight of, I will tear you to pieces, on Christ's shoulders, not on mine.
[time=2966] And he extended to me via Jesus, verse 23, that says, "I will show you my salvation."
[time=2976] Let me read to you from Romans 3.
[time=2978] Romans 3 is a beautiful verse that shows us both the justice and the compassion of God.
[time=2983] God presented him Jesus as a sacrifice of atonement
[time=2989] through faith in his blood.
[time=2992] He did this to demonstrate his justice, verse 22 of Psalm 50, because in his forbearance or in his patience or his silence, he left the sins committed beforehand unpunished.
[time=3005] He did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just, verse 22, and the one who justifies verse 23, those who have faith in Jesus.
[time=3019] God's just and the justifier in the person of Jesus.
[time=3024] P.T., if you'll come back up.
[time=3027] Before he starts to play, I just wanna sing a familiar song that kind of illustrates that connection to, we sing it a lot,
[time=3036] [MUSIC - 15 seconds]
[time=3056] That's it, it's Jesus.
[time=3059] That's verse 22 and verse 23 coming together for a beautiful picture of justice and justification.
[time=3065] This morning, I want you to think and self-evaluate a little bit.
[time=3072] Go ahead.
[time=3073] Do you have a tendency to be a heartless worshipper today?
[time=3078] Do you have a tendency to be detached and mechanical in the way that you approach worship?
[time=3085] Not singing, but worship, all of it.
[time=3088] And if that's the case this morning, I wanna just invite you to sing a little bit with us here at the end.
[time=3097] Perhaps this morning, you identify with what A.S.F. said regarding hypocritical worship, and you kind of pretend you do the worship thing when you're around other worshipers, and then when you're around the world, you look a little bit more like them.
[time=3112] And maybe God's convicting you to come to Jesus and let him through Jesus.
[time=3120] You beat the tar out of your sin and then offer you brand new life in Christ.
[time=3126] And so I'll invite you to sing this too.
[time=3130] If you feel like God's convicting you in regard to hypocritical worship.
[time=3134] If you would, we're just gonna sing.
[time=3138] I come broken to be men, did I come wounded, to be healed, to remind us that we all have tendencies toward heartlessness and hypocrisy, but in Christ we can be wounded rather, and we can be healed, and we can be rescued from our worship tendencies that are bad.
[time=3160] So if you've identified with one of those categories, this morning you don't have to sing it loud, but I invite you to sing it.
[time=3166] And sing with PT as we sing about coming to God in our broken state, letting him in Jesus heal us and mend us and rescue us.
[time=3177] [MUSIC - 39 seconds]
[time=3221] Let's sing that again.
[time=3225] [MUSIC - 40 seconds]
[time=3274] - God, this morning we want you to heal us
[time=3282] and save us from our hearts that have a bent toward being mechanical in our worship and our hearts that have a bent toward being pretenders in our worship.
[time=3293] We want to be real and authentic before you.
[time=3297] We want to bring you thanks and honor and glory.
[time=3300] We don't want to just give you routine or the leftovers or the stuff that didn't quite, you know, make it onto our priority list.
[time=3310] We want to give you the best every time.
[time=3313] God, I pray that you would heal us and change us and make us new today.
[time=3320] In Jesus' name.
[time=3321] Would you all stand together and we're going to sing one more song together that just reminds us of God's position in our lives as the son of our solar system.
[time=3334] You're saying you are my supply, you're the breath of life, you're more awesome than I know.
[time=3340] Let's just lift that verse and a couple of courses together as we close this morning.
[time=3346] [MUSIC - 180 seconds]
