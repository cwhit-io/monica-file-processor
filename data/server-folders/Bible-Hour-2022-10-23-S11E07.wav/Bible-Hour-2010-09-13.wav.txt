[time=60] (upbeat music)
[time=90] [MUSIC - 107 seconds]
[time=199] - Let's sing it out.
[time=201] [MUSIC - 349 seconds]
[time=564] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=566] It's great to be with you again.
[time=568] And I want to say a special welcome to those of you who watch week after week.
[time=573] And I've talked with many of you.
[time=575] You email me.
[time=577] I run into you out and about in this community of ours.
[time=581] And I know that there are hundreds of you that watch each week.
[time=585] And you still haven't quite figured out this faith thing.
[time=590] You're still trying.
[time=591] You're still searching.
[time=593] You're still asking questions and compiling answers.
[time=596] And on your spiritual journey, you're still trying to kind of make your way down the road.
[time=601] Today, the message you're gonna hear really is a message that I think God put on our heart for you.
[time=608] There are times when people struggle with what we do here in the church.
[time=614] There are misconceptions and there are opinions that people have established over the years for a number of different reasons.
[time=621] And in today's message, we just tried our very best to address just a few of those things, too in particular.
[time=628] And I wanna just say the two and I want you to just do your best today to listen and see what God might have for you as we talk about this.
[time=636] There are some of you out there watching and there are many who I've bumped into over the years who think the church is judgmental.
[time=644] That's right.
[time=644] They think the church is judgmental.
[time=647] They think that people in the church go around judging those who are outside the church and it really bothers them.
[time=653] And I wanna talk to you today about that.
[time=656] And then also there are those of you out there who may really view the church as irrelevant.
[time=661] That's right.
[time=662] You know you need help and you know your life on many fronts is in crisis or in jeopardy and you want to be helped and you want to be encouraged but your view of the church is that it really doesn't in an impactful way make your life different.
[time=680] It's irrelevant.
[time=681] It's not pertinent to the everyday of your life and there's some things about that that I wanna make sure you hear us talk about today.
[time=688] So there's a lot of other issues I know but those are two things that I know many of you wrestle with.
[time=693] I'm thankful for your willingness to wrestle with those things with us.
[time=697] We love you, we're thankful that we have this relationship with you and I hope today will be an encouragement to you.
[time=704] Listen, see what God will have for you.
[time=706] As always, we'd love to see you soon come by anytime.
[time=710] God bless you and have a great week.
[time=712] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 164 seconds]
[time=883] (audience applauds) - Well, I wanna talk to you this morning about,
[time=898] and I think it's appropriate again with guests here and people who are kind of checking things out.
[time=903] And as we kind of jump into a new season of ministry here, I wanna just talk to you this morning at a very practical, honest level about some things, having to do with the church, with us.
[time=914] We know the church isn't a building, we know the church isn't an address, we know the church is by virtue of God's word and its definition, a body of believers, it is a people.
[time=925] And there are some things I believe about the church today that are really, really encouraging.
[time=930] There are some things, if you got me going on the church and what I was encouraged by, what I was thankful for, the list would be long, we could be here for a long, long time.
[time=939] But one thing I believe both statistically, I mean there's data that would support this.
[time=948] And subjectively, there is a growing sense that I and others are feeling.
[time=956] One thing I believe both statistically and objectively, though, is that a growing number of people have issues with the church, it's really true.
[time=968] There are growing number of people today in our country and around the world that are struggling with their view and their understanding of the church.
[time=977] I talk to a lot of people who are confused by the church.
[time=982] I talk to a lot of people who have had bad, really bad experiences with the church.
[time=990] There are those who find the church at its message and even its people to be detached and distant from the world they live in.
[time=999] They see the church as cold, they've experienced the church as being greedy, they see it as unimportant.
[time=1007] What do they mean by unimportant?
[time=1011] Not pertinent to the everyday issues of their everyday lives.
[time=1018] Somebody said to me not too long ago, if I wanted to get lectured and condemned on a Sunday morning, I could just stay home with my wife.
[time=1026] I don't think he was trying to be funny, but it was a little humorous.
[time=1032] I've tried it for years.
[time=1035] Somebody else told me not too long ago.
[time=1036] I've tried it for years, but honestly, it never once really helped me face my life and all that comes with it in a different or more meaningful way.
[time=1049] Somebody else wrote not too long ago, I just got tired of the hypocrisy.
[time=1053] I knew too many people.
[time=1056] At the few churches I attended who professed and proclaimed their love for the Lord yet lived in a way that disgraced his principles.
[time=1066] Now there may be those of you in the room this morning who are here and I may have just articulated
[time=1075] by virtue of a quote from someone you didn't even know, I may have touched on the very things you feel today.
[time=1082] Or maybe there are those of you in the room who have felt those things.
[time=1086] You've wrestled with those challenges and those issues.
[time=1090] And there are those of you in the room today who love passionately like I do, the church and all.
[time=1096] I believe all we believe God designed it to be and it breaks your heart like it breaks mine.
[time=1101] When this one doesn't function the way it should and when the church at large doesn't function the way God designed it to and people are left feeling and experiencing these kinds of things.
[time=1112] So I want us just to talk about this for a little bit this morning.
[time=1116] Here's what I want to try and do today.
[time=1118] First of all, I want to try and simplify what I believe many people today are saying and feeling about the church.
[time=1124] And I'll over simplify, I know, I always do.
[time=1128] And I want to just kind of whittle it down to two things, maybe three this morning.
[time=1132] But I believe people are saying and feeling about the church.
[time=1134] And then secondly, I want to be very clear about our response to that.
[time=1138] I want to be very clear about how we at Blackhawk at least are trying to approach this opportunity that God has given us here in this community, here in this place.
[time=1152] What kind of church are we trying to be?
[time=1155] What kind of people do we want to be in the midst of this opportunity that God has given us?
[time=1162] So here we go.
[time=1163] Just a couple, maybe two or three things.
[time=1166] Simplify that I think I bump into, I know you bump into as we deal with the view that people have of the bride of Christ, the church.
[time=1176] The problem with the church is that it's according to some people, the problem with the church is that it's number one, you could write this down, judgmental, judgmental.
[time=1186] People really struggle with this.
[time=1191] People all over the world and people all over my world and folks all over your world struggle with the fact that they see the church and those, especially who are in it as being judgmental.
[time=1203] Had a lady tell me not too long ago, I'm never coming back.
[time=1206] She said, every time I come, I just leave feeling guilty.
[time=1209] I don't know who you think you are.
[time=1212] We talked a little bit more about it and didn't make a whole lot of progress.
[time=1216] I can't tell you how many times I've been talking with people in crisis as they try to work through things that may be in my office, it may be in a restaurant booth or even down front here on a Sunday morning after a service and having shared with them what I believe God would want them to do and having shared with them how it is God might want them to change and having tried to do that in a way that was loving and kind.
[time=1245] I can't tell you how many times you can say this with me because I know you've heard this as well, they've looked at me and said, yeah, who are you to what?
[time=1255] Say it out loud.
[time=1258] Judge.
[time=1259] See, it's just, it's just Ennis.
[time=1263] We're going down this road and someone comes along
[time=1269] and offers the inside or offers the suggestion or offers the truth and so many times what immediately boils up is who are you to judge?
[time=1284] To which I want to sometimes say, wait a minute, I just bought you lunch.
[time=1289] I've prayed for you for like four weeks straight.
[time=1294] We've met three times in a schedule that didn't have room for it and I'm the jerk who's judging.
[time=1299] I don't say that though.
[time=1302] I don't say that, but as I've thought about it, I think I've really come to understand over the years what's going on right there in that tension.
[time=1313] And here it is.
[time=1315] You see, and I can just speak for me and I can speak for our family here, this place and its leadership.
[time=1322] There is a foundation that exists here at Black Hawk and it colors this foundation.
[time=1329] It colors and shapes and directs everything we do.
[time=1334] It colors and shapes and directs all the advice we give.
[time=1341] And that foundation is the very words of who, God.
[time=1347] That foundation that shapes and directs our message
[time=1355] and our efforts and our heart hopefully.
[time=1359] Isn't the words of Kelly?
[time=1361] It's not the words of our board.
[time=1363] It is the very words of God.
[time=1368] The truth, we believe that this book is the absolute truth and it gives us God's design for man and all of his life.
[time=1384] I love what the word of God says about the word of God.
[time=1389] I love what it says in Psalm 19.
[time=1394] Would you turn there?
[time=1395] It says in Psalm 19, not Psalm 119.
[time=1401] If you wanna read what the Psalmist thought and sensed and experienced with the word of God, you should read Psalm 119.
[time=1411] It's only 178 verses, you get through it in a week or so.
[time=1416] But I love what he says in Psalm 19 as well.
[time=1420] The law of the Lord, the law of the Lord, another phrase for the word of God.
[time=1426] The law of the Lord is what?
[time=1427] Say it out loud.
[time=1429] Perfect, restoring the soul.
[time=1431] The testimony of the Lord, the word of God is sure, making wise the simple, the precepts of the Lord.
[time=1440] The word of God are what?
[time=1441] Say it, right, rejoicing the heart.
[time=1445] The commandment of the Lord, the word of God is pure enlightening the eyes.
[time=1451] The law of the Lord is perfect.
[time=1454] The word of God is sure.
[time=1460] Go back to your new testament.
[time=1465] Go to second Timothy, if you would.
[time=1466] Go ahead, let me hear the pages turning.
[time=1469] Everybody kind of make your way.
[time=1471] Second Timothy, chapter three.
[time=1473] I love what it says there, Paul, writing to encourage Timothy.
[time=1477] He says in three, 16, all scripture.
[time=1480] All scripture is inspired by God and profitable
[time=1487] for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness.
[time=1493] I love that verse.
[time=1494] I love the simplicity of it and I love the power of it.
[time=1497] All scripture is what?
[time=1499] Inspired.
[time=1501] Some of you in the room understand that phrase.
[time=1502] Others of you just kind of sort of get it.
[time=1504] Let me just tell you real briefly.
[time=1506] It means God breathed.
[time=1508] The word of God, did you know this?
[time=1514] Is God's breath God breathed it literally into those who recorded it and wrote it and God and his providence and sovereignty has kept it for us, for you and for me?
[time=1529] All scripture, the word of God is inspired.
[time=1533] Guys didn't make it up.
[time=1535] God breathed it into them.
[time=1538] And when we use it and when we embrace it and when we believe in it, what does it say?
[time=1544] It says, all scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for explaining things to you and to me, people who need things to be explained.
[time=1555] It is profitable for teaching, for reproof.
[time=1558] When we wander, when mistakes get made, it shows us that mistake.
[time=1563] It shows us the distance between our choices and his truth.
[time=1567] It's profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction.
[time=1572] Once the word of God has nailed us, once the word of God has shed light on our choice, it then helps us, it corrects us.
[time=1581] It doesn't leave us flapping in the wind.
[time=1584] No, it's truth can move us down this road of growth, correction and for training.
[time=1590] Second Peter one.
[time=1593] Second Peter one, but know this first of all, you see it there on the screen, but know this first of all, that no prophecy of scripture, the word of God itself.
[time=1604] None of it is a matter of one's own interpretation.
[time=1607] For no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will.
[time=1612] You can be confident that none of this came from the will of man.
[time=1617] None of this came from the will of man, but men instead moved by the Holy Spirit.
[time=1623] There is that inspiration word.
[time=1626] Men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.
[time=1629] And I love what it does say in Psalm 119.
[time=1636] Psalm 119.105 says your word, scriptures themselves, it says your word is a what?
[time=1645] Say it, is a lamp, it's a light unto my feet.
[time=1650] And a light, it is a lamp unto my feet and a light to my path.
[time=1657] And here's what can happen.
[time=1659] All right, back to judgmental.
[time=1662] Back to the perception that some people have.
[time=1664] Here's what can happen when God's design, God's truth, meets up with our human choices that go against that truth.
[time=1672] When that happens, there's a clear sense of something not being right.
[time=1677] It's just the way it is.
[time=1680] Man's human, sinful choices that contradict God's established truth.
[time=1687] When that happens, there is a sense that something isn't right.
[time=1692] There is a sense of judgment.
[time=1694] There is a sense of guilt.
[time=1697] Illustrate it for you this way.
[time=1698] When you blow through a red light, not that any of you ever would, but when you blow through a red light going 60 and a 35 and you get pulled over by an officer who writes you up a very costly, very painful ticket.
[time=1714] Let me ask you the question, who or what judged you, the officer or the law, who or what judged you,
[time=1726] the patrolman or the truth, the truth?
[time=1733] Then see, the same thing happens at church.
[time=1737] Same thing happens with you and me and a booth in the back of Applebee's.
[time=1743] You and a believing friend of yours who may be trying to speak some hope and direction into your life.
[time=1750] Same thing happens sometimes when you sit here and hear me or others declare what God's word says and you want to get up and leave and say, "I'm never coming again.
[time=1759] "Every time I'm here, I just feel guilty." It's not me, it's not your friend.
[time=1766] It's the truth.
[time=1771] When you're blowing through, listen, when you're blowing through life, going 60 and a 35, pick your scenario there.
[time=1780] When you're blowing through life, going 60 and a 35, ignoring God's principles and you hear the truth and someone shares
[time=1796] with you God's design the uneasiness you feel, the conviction you feel, the judgment you sense, where's that really coming from, God's truth or the church?
[time=1807] No, it's God's truth.
[time=1809] God or me, God, which watch this, which allows me to be, allows us to be church, allows us to be not judgmental.
[time=1822] It allows us to be gracious.
[time=1825] It allows us to be kind.
[time=1830] Does this make sense?
[time=1832] Because most of you know, like I know and have learned over the years, that God's word never ever instructs us to be judge and jury.
[time=1839] God never intended for us to bring conviction.
[time=1843] Judgment and conviction comes from whom?
[time=1848] God and his word and his spirit.
[time=1852] And you? No.
[time=1854] You and I get the privilege of walking alongside.
[time=1859] You and I get the privilege of opening our arms.
[time=1862] You and I get the privilege of being a place where we can embrace and welcome those who are on this journey.
[time=1868] And I'll tell you what, at Blackhawk, I've said this before and we'll just keep saying it.
[time=1873] We will do our very best to be a safe place to hear a very dangerous message.
[time=1880] And the dangerous part is the conviction and the life change and the transformation that can come.
[time=1887] But that's all up to him and it's between him and you and we wanna just simply help that process, not hinder it.
[time=1894] I wanna remind you too, if you're here this morning, this is important, if you're here this morning and you're trying to think these things through and you're wondering why it is, you feel what you feel inside when you do and choose
[time=1910] what just doesn't seem right.
[time=1913] And I wanna just read you what it says in Romans 1.
[time=1917] It's very telling, it's very insightful.
[time=1919] It says in Romans 1.18, this won't be on the screen, just listen, for the wrath of God, listen, for the wrath of God, judgment, for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth, suppress people trying to keep it down.
[time=1947] They suppress the truth and unrighteousness because that which is known about God is evident within them.
[time=1956] I don't want you to miss this.
[time=1962] If you don't know him this morning, if you haven't bowed the knee of your heart and entered into a fully surrendered relationship with him and you kind of view yourself on the outside looking in but why when you go and do this, why when you go there, why when you think this stuff, what is it in you that brings that sense of conviction?
[time=1982] I wanna just tell you, it doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter where you've been.
[time=1987] God's word tells us that down deep inside, you know what's right because you were made in the image of who, God.
[time=1998] And yeah, that image has gotten all screwed up, tainted and twisted and sins done in incredibly horrible stuff but it's still there.
[time=2007] And our hope is to be a place and a people who would help you understand that better.
[time=2015] Not because we're judgmental but because we're willing to tell you the truth and teach you the truth and then allow God to do with you and the truth what he will.
[time=2028] Amen?
[time=2030] Second thing, I just hear a lot and I see a lot and I watch this going on and I wanna just kind of get it out there for us.
[time=2036] Some people would say the problem with the church is that it's irrelevant, that it's irrelevant.
[time=2043] Some was sad as it is to think about, it's really true.
[time=2046] Some would say that they could look at the church and all that is said and done and at the end of the day say,
[time=2057] so what, so what?
[time=2061] So you said all that and you did whatever you did and so what in the world difference is it making?
[time=2069] And the sad truth about this one my friends is that in some settings, this is true.
[time=2077] Kills me, but it's true.
[time=2084] There are places where the church and what is said and what is done has become utterly irrelevant.
[time=2094] And it's irrelevant on those two fronts, it's message.
[time=2099] Listen, it's message.
[time=2102] You know, it's teaching, it doesn't lead to real practical life help, life change and life transformation, which is what they need and they know it, it's become irrelevant on the message front and it's become irrelevant on the effort, on the programs, it's efforts, it's collective ministry efforts, more and more so, don't really make a difference in the church today.
[time=2132] When you look at what the church is doing and you ask the question, does it really matter in too many places, it's become irrelevant?
[time=2143] Because I believe in too many places it's gotten away from what?
[time=2147] From the truth, from the gospel, from the good news
[time=2154] and the things that scripture has to say, now listen, I wanna just talk to you about this.
[time=2158] As far as our message, and I'm not being defensive here, I'm gonna just try and share this with you as it kind of would come out of my heart and our heart here at Blackhawk.
[time=2167] As far as our message, here's something that I know I can say, I know you need whoever you are.
[time=2174] Whoever you are, I know you need help.
[time=2180] I know you need help with the very real, very challenging everyday issues of your very real life.
[time=2188] How do I know this?
[time=2189] Because I do, I need help.
[time=2195] I need it desperately and the good news for you and me is that God's word speaks to all of those areas within which you and I need help and it blows me away how when I talk to people and I talk to them all the time it still blows me away when people say you're kidding me.
[time=2213] God's word speaks to that and I wanna just remind you, it does, marriage tension, marriage failure,
[time=2223] emotional health, parenting guidelines and principles, sexual purity, finances, work relationships, relational strife, addictions, self-control, and the list goes on and on and on.
[time=2242] You name it and the scriptures can provide relevant and a helpful direction that we desperately need.
[time=2252] Now, I emphasize that word desperately and you can ask well, why do I say desperately?
[time=2258] Because I believe you desperately need help.
[time=2264] And again, doesn't matter how long you've been coming into this room, it doesn't matter how long you've known, the Lord, it doesn't matter if you know him or you don't know him.
[time=2272] When I look at you, when I look at me, when I look at the challenges we face and the tendencies that we have, I'm telling you, you desperately need the relevant practical help of the Word of God.
[time=2289] Simple illustration, if you have been around here at all and those of you who have been, you know me, anybody here that knows me, if you ever were to see me with one of these, you would have reason to be scared.
[time=2302] Because I don't really know much about this stuff.
[time=2306] And if ever you would see me around anything like electrical or anything having to do with just this whole genre, you'd just be good to run.
[time=2318] And so if you stumbled upon me and I was trying to get this thing to work, I suppose if it was plugged in, it might help, but forget this is just kind of hanging here like this.
[time=2329] If I'm trying to get this thing to work and I'm not quite sure what's going on and it doesn't seem to be working and I'm frustrated and I don't quite know what to do and I'm tinkering and I just say, well, forget it here, I'll just maybe this'll help, you know, just go like that.
[time=2346] You know, my buddy liked that back there, didn't you?
[time=2350] (audience laughing) - I didn't get it there.
[time=2354] (audience laughing) - You would say, yeah, you would say, dude.
[time=2361] You don't put a light bulb in with a what?
[time=2370] And I would say, now I would say, oh, I guess you're right, you know, it didn't work so well.
[time=2375] And you say, what's the point?
[time=2378] Well, the point is this, how obvious, yeah?
[time=2383] But see, I tell you what, I watch you live.
[time=2390] And I know you watch me, so we're in this together, but for the sake of the illustration, let me just say it.
[time=2398] I watch you live.
[time=2399] And there's so many times I wanna just come up to you and say, dude, you can't, you can't treat your family like that.
[time=2413] You know, this says differently than what you're doing.
[time=2419] Dude, dude, you can't, you can't treat your family like that.
[time=2425] I wanna say, hey, you can't treat your husband that way.
[time=2430] You just can't.
[time=2431] You treating your husband that way.
[time=2437] You treating your boss the way you're treating your boss.
[time=2443] You making the choices I see you making that are so contrary to the practical, helpful insights that God wants you to have.
[time=2452] It's like, it's like, dude, you can't put a light bulb in with a what, with a hammer.
[time=2461] And I just, I wanna say stop.
[time=2465] It's a mess.
[time=2469] It doesn't work.
[time=2471] I did all that first hour over here, but I didn't wanna hit you with all the shards of glass, so I moved it away from my wife.
[time=2482] But then I realized Corbin and Tanya were sitting right there.
[time=2485] I didn't know what to do, so I just hit it as hard.
[time=2488] But anyway, I think the most tragic, the most tragic thing maybe that could ever happen here is if somehow you came for help and we didn't give it to you.
[time=2506] And all the help you need is right here.
[time=2512] Everything pertaining to life and godliness.
[time=2515] God has given us in his word, and we want to be, listen, we have this huge commitment to give you the words of God so they can be a lamp, a better one than this one is now.
[time=2532] We wanna give you the words of God so it can be a lamp, Psalm 119.105, to your feet.
[time=2542] And it is so far from being irrelevant.
[time=2547] I love that verse, I don't know if you've ever thought about it.
[time=2550] I just thought about it this week and did a little lookin' into it.
[time=2553] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet.
[time=2555] Think about that, feet.
[time=2560] It doesn't say that your word is a lamp unto my mind or a lamp unto my soul.
[time=2567] No, the psalmist there speaks practically and helpfully the word of God is a lamp unto your feet because it needs to light your path for your next, what?
[time=2579] Wow, you're very next.
[time=2585] He cares about your very next steps and every one of your steps and mind should be lit by the word of God and the truth of God.
[time=2600] So as far as our message, I, boy, I don't want it to be, we don't want it to be irrelevant and we believe our message because our message is the word of God.
[time=2609] We believe it's extremely helpful for the everyday of life.
[time=2613] What about our efforts?
[time=2615] Well, you know what?
[time=2616] We're learning on this front.
[time=2618] We believe it's important to gather as a family.
[time=2623] We believe it's important to connect in smaller settings.
[time=2626] We believe it's hugely imperative that we go.
[time=2630] We talk a lot about gather, connect and go.
[time=2633] We're trying to be a place that's about those things because they're biblically driven and we're learning, I think, to take the gospel and the good news of what Christ has done and this call on us to be a priesthood of all believers.
[time=2650] We're trying, we have a long way to go, but we're learning.
[time=2653] I'm not saying this again to give you our resume.
[time=2658] I'm not saying this to be boastful or proud.
[time=2660] I'm just saying this because I'm thankful that we're learning that what we do with all this matters.
[time=2667] We're sending, I think, our fourth team in the last three or four years to Kenya, to Nairobi in just a few weeks to go and hold babies in an orphanage that we've now partnered with in Nairobi that rescues HIV/AIDS infected infants and toddlers.
[time=2682] It's an amazing experience.
[time=2684] I've gone twice to change your life forever.
[time=2689] We believe we're passing along.
[time=2691] It's what priests do.
[time=2692] They pass along the attributes of God.
[time=2694] We believe we're passing along God's compassion and God's love.
[time=2698] That's why we've sent, I think, for the last four years teams to Serbia to teach English and Serbian summer camps and using the gospel and the word of God as a means by which of teaching English relationships have been established and kids have come to faith in Christ.
[time=2713] That's why we support 33 missionary families in 21 different countries.
[time=2719] And believe me, when I say this, around here, missionaries, 33 of them in 21 different countries around here that goes way beyond postcards on a refrigerator.
[time=2729] It's really serious and significant to us.
[time=2734] They're friends of ours.
[time=2735] We know all of them and they're out there giving their lives in places far, far away with incredible tasks and opportunities to make disciples.
[time=2747] As blown away last year, when so many of you and this family in response to the crisis in Haiti, because we got exposed to an opportunity with surgical cleaning enzymes and the medical need in Haiti, you gave in cash above and beyond $27,000 that got sent to make a difference in the lives of people.
[time=2774] Thrilled my heart, still does to this day, and as much as that thrills me, it thrills me every week when there's cards out there on the vine.
[time=2781] The vine is an opportunity we have to try and meet the real needs of real people right here in our family.
[time=2787] When I think about relevancy in terms of our programs, I'm thankful again to God for about 750 kids and their families who are part of our school on a weekly basis, a daily basis.
[time=2801] We get to make an investment into the lives of kids and their families, so we don't wanna be judgmental, we don't have to be, we can be gracious and kind, amen?
[time=2815] We don't wanna be irrelevant, but see, we don't have to work it coming up with something that is relevant because there isn't anything more relevant than what?
[time=2823] The word of God.
[time=2824] We just need to be, listen, listen, we need to be willing
[time=2831] to communicate it in ways that are honest and forthright, loving and kind, gracious.
[time=2837] We could come off as judgmental, we could do that.
[time=2840] We can have the truth, and we can come off harsh, and we can come off rigid, but that's not how God's made us.
[time=2849] I'm so thankful for our team and the spirit of this place.
[time=2853] That's, if I were gonna get into a third and I won't, Corbin, why don't you guys come on up at this time, we're gonna just close with some worship this morning and a chance to respond to God.
[time=2861] If there was a third problem, maybe that I would address, a lot of people think the church is in trouble because it's fake, maybe you've heard that.
[time=2872] It's fake, it's hypocritical.
[time=2875] I just wanna tell you, I can't begin to express to you
[time=2881] how thankful I am that our team and our elders and somewhere it got built into me, and I'm thankful for it, we're just not.
[time=2893] What we just, what you see is what you get.
[time=2897] We've learned to be authentic.
[time=2899] We think there's great value in transparency.
[time=2902] We make mistakes, I'll oftentimes share those with you.
[time=2907] We try not to, you know, do ministry in a way
[time=2914] that leaves you feeling like somehow those of us up up here are different than those of you down there.
[time=2921] Jesus was authentic, he was real.
[time=2924] Paul, the apostles, those who birthed the church, there was a transparency there, and we're trying our very best to follow suit.
[time=2931] So I'm grateful, grateful that you're here today, thankful that we can be a part of a place like this.
[time=2937] We're not perfect, we have a lot of progress to make, but that's what's in our heart.
[time=2941] I wanna just invite you to stand if you would.
[time=2944] We're gonna go have some lunch here in just a little bit, but would you just fill this room up with praise and a response to our God as Corbin leads us, and I'll come back up here in a moment and close us.
[time=2956] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 296 seconds]
[time=3260] - Say that one more time.
[time=3264] [MUSIC - 16 seconds]
[time=3284] - He's a good God, amen?
[time=3293] And he, listen, he desires, and he designed you to live well.
[time=3300] Good.
[time=3304] And I just want to make this available to you this morning.
[time=3308] If there's anybody in the room, it's been so sweet to be able to do this in recent weeks and we're gonna just keep offering you opportunities.
[time=3315] If there's anybody in the room this morning, and you're just, you're just smashing these left and right.
[time=3326] You're just trying to do it the wrong way.
[time=3332] The wrong as defined by him.
[time=3335] We want to help you.
[time=3337] We want to encourage you.
[time=3339] We want to pray for you.
[time=3341] We want to walk with you.
[time=3342] It's not brain surgery, you know?
[time=3347] But sometimes it just takes a little bit of help and encouragement in people alongside you.
[time=3352] So as Corbin plays and as we dismiss here in a moment, we'll just give the opportunity to come down front.
[time=3357] I'll ask our elders and staff to come on down and we'll just take a few minutes and pray with you if there's anybody who needs some prayer on any issue where you're just using the hammer and we've got to try and do it differently.
[time=3370] I also want to just encourage all of you, again, everybody that calls this place home, everybody here in the room.
[time=3376] If you want to make a quick cell phone call and invite some friends real quick, that's fine.
[time=3380] Stay for lunch, we'd love to feed you.
[time=3382] We don't get a chance as a family to sit at the table, so to speak, very often.
[time=3387] So let's be together today for a little while longer.
[time=3391] And thank you for being a family that I know is doing your best to be all that God has called us to be.
[time=3399] Father in heaven, we leave this morning grateful, thankful that your spirit and your word and you
[time=3412] do things in people that we don't have to do.
[time=3416] God's so very thankful that we are relevant not because we're clever and not because we're creative necessarily, but God because we have the gift of your life-changing word of God.
[time=3431] And God, I pray that we would be a gracious people who handle that word and not only teach it, but live it out, God, in a way that's inviting, in a way that's encouraging to others.
[time=3445] For those in the room this morning, God who need help and encouragement and the everyday issues of life, folks that we could pray for and encourage as they put their hammers away and with help from your word and your spirit and your people, begin to kind of put the light bulb in the way you designed it.
[time=3465] God allow them to come forward and know, even for those who don't let them know and sense our love for them and our desire to encourage them.
[time=3474] God, what a privilege to be together today.
[time=3478] What an honor it's been to bless your name with all that is within us.
[time=3483] And everybody in the room agreed with the prayer and setting.
[time=3488] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=3508] (upbeat music)
