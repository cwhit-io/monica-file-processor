[time=371] - In November of 1871, Horatio Spafford decided
[time=381] to take a European vacation with his wife and their four daughters.
[time=386] At the last minute, he was detained because of a business issue.
[time=390] And so he sent them on ahead and planned to meet with them later.
[time=395] That night, the ship on which they were traveling was struck by another vessel, and it sunk within 12 minutes' time.
[time=406] By the time any news reached Horatio of survivors, the message from his wife simply said, "Saved alone."
[time=417] In a few days later, Horatio was aboard a different ship.
[time=422] He was on his way to meet with his grieving wife.
[time=426] When the captain of the ship called him aside and told him that at that moment they were sailing above the spot where his daughters' lives were lost.
[time=439] It is believed that at that very spot, Horatio penned the words
[time=446] when sorrows, like sea billows, roll.
[time=452] Those words later became lyrics to a song in which I and countless others have found comfort and inspiration, the song it is well.
[time=464] As I was looking through the lyrics, a different phrase stuck out to me.
[time=470] That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate.
[time=476] There are so many times when we feel helpless.
[time=481] When our financial resources have met their end and the bills keep rolling in, when we work and work at a relationship that the other person doesn't try, when the doctor shakes her head and says, "We've done all we can do." In those moments, we feel helpless.
[time=505] And I imagined that Horatio and his wife felt so helpless.
[time=510] There was nothing they could do to go back and change what had happened.
[time=515] All of these trials come into our lives as a result of the fact that we live in a world affected by sin.
[time=524] But Christ doesn't leave us there in the middle of our helpless estate.
[time=532] Christ regards us.
[time=535] He looks on us.
[time=537] He sees.
[time=540] And he shed his own blood for our souls.
[time=548] And so along with Horatio, no matter what trials we face, we truly can celebrate that because of Christ, it is well.
[time=564] The Apostle Paul has said that he had learned the secret of being content in any circumstance, in sickness, or being well, and being hungry, or being well fed.
[time=577] And he had learned that secret, and it's a secret that's answered in Christ.
[time=583] And this morning, we are going to take this song.
[time=587] It is well with my soul and let it be kind of the platform for the rest of our service today.
[time=592] I believe the Holy Spirit inspired Horatio Spafford to write the poem that he did several hundred years ago.
[time=599] And he captured in poetic form the truth of Scripture in each and every verse.
[time=604] So we're going to kind of pick that apart together today and think about what it means to be content in any circumstance.
[time=611] For it to be well with our souls in any circumstance.
[time=614] For it to be in our hearts a place of peace and a place of rest, no matter what.
[time=620] So we're going to start with the first verse, and it talks about peace, like a river or sorrows, like sea billows, and Kelly's going to come in just a minute and kind of let us think about what those verses might mean for us today.
[time=634] [MUSIC]
[time=642] When peace like a river, a ten death my way,
[time=653] when sorrows like sea billows rose,
[time=663] would ever my lot thou hast taught me to sing.
[time=674] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=686] [MUSIC]
[time=702] I'm really thankful for a time like this.
[time=706] We don't do this often, but every once in a while, we feel as if it's healthy for us individually as people,
[time=716] but also collectively as a family to be able to have a time to sit back and with really no hurry and nothing but the hopefully spirit of God
[time=726] prompting us and ministering to us to take a moment and say, in essence, how are you?
[time=734] Really down at that deepest part of you, the soul.
[time=742] Down at that part of you where there's either a real vibrant connection with him or maybe today a distant and loose connection,
[time=753] whichever way in these moments we want to give you the opportunity to think about and to consider the health and the well-being of your soul.
[time=763] I wish that, and I wish this often when I look around this room, you know me, you know I'd love it if we could just, I'd love to just come and sit next to you and just look you right in the eye, just put my arm around you and say, how are you?
[time=778] What's been going on and how have you been and how can I pray for you?
[time=783] But I can't do that, so we try our best to just make this as personal and honest and intimate as possible and pray God's blessing on this time and hope that you'll feel encouraged and helped in the process.
[time=796] So, back to the first verse, when two things going on here, when peace like a river, a tendeth your soul,
[time=807] and everybody in the room kind of knows how peaceful a rolling river can be.
[time=812] Everybody gets the imagery there of waters that are just trickling along, smooth sailing. And there are those of you in the room this morning and you can identify with what the Psalmist said in Psalm 145, you can see it on the screen, you open Psalm 145, 16, and 17, you open your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
[time=836] The Lord is righteous in all his ways and kind in all his deeds.
[time=841] The Lord is near to all who call upon him, to all who call upon him in truth, he will fulfill the desire of those who fear him.
[time=850] He will also hear the cry, hear their cry and will save them.
[time=856] I just wrote this down as I read that this week.
[time=859] There the psalmist says in essence, "Oh God, you've satisfied me.
[time=863] You've granted me my desires.
[time=866] You've been faithful to me, near to me.
[time=869] You've heard me, helped me, and rescued me." And there are those of you in the room this morning and circumstantially.
[time=879] This is where you live today.
[time=881] Circumstantially, you find yourself in a season of God's blessing, and you find yourself more importantly than being in a season of his blessing.
[time=888] You find yourself richly and meaningfully connected to him, and that connection allows you today to be in this place and say, "Praise God for days and seasons where it feels as if the river is
[time=902] peaceful and flowing." And I don't want to move too quickly away from you all, but I wanted to say to you this morning, be grateful.
[time=912] Because there are others in the room this morning, and it doesn't feel like a peaceful river.
[time=920] In fact, truth be told, for some of you in the room this morning, it feels anything but peaceful.
[time=926] Circumstantially in your life.
[time=929] For days or recent weeks or maybe it's even been recent years.
[time=934] It has seemed dark.
[time=936] It has seemed heavy.
[time=938] The winds have blown hard.
[time=941] The rain has come down, and your soul today feels distant and not well.
[time=949] Let me read to you what it says.
[time=952] The Psalmist penned these words in Psalm 88.
[time=956] I don't think they'll be on the screen, but let me just read them to you.
[time=960] It says in Psalm 88.
[time=962] O Lord, the God of my salvation.
[time=966] He understands that to be true, and yet here what he writes, I have cried out by day and in the night before you.
[time=975] Let my prayer come before you and climb your ear to my cry.
[time=980] Here the Psalmist articulates what I know many of you in the room have sensed and felt before.
[time=986] I see that he says, let my prayer come before you as if maybe his prayer,
[time=992] what?
[time=994] Wasn't being allowed to come before him as if his prayer wasn't being what?
[time=1001] Heard?
[time=1003] There are times when the Psalmist and his cry echoes the cry of your heart and mind.
[time=1008] Oh God, where are you?
[time=1010] Would you please hear my cry?
[time=1013] Cline your ear to my cry.
[time=1015] For my soul, verse 3, Psalm 88, for my soul has had enough troubles, and my life has drawn near to Sheol.
[time=1025] I am reckoned among those who go down to the pit.
[time=1029] I have become like a man without strength, weak, and weary, and tired, and discouraged.
[time=1041] For second, verse 5, the Psalmist feels forsaken among the dead, he says, like the slain who lie in a grave.
[time=1051] This is where his trouble, and this is where the heartache has taken him, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom you remember no more, and they are cut off from your hand.
[time=1063] Here it is a hand of blessing, here it is a hand of comfort, and there are times when the Psalmist felt as if, and there are times, today, is one of those where you feel distant from his hand, that hand of blessing and peace and comfort.
[time=1080] Verse 6, you have put me in the lowest pit.
[time=1091] Oh God of my salvation, you have allowed me to be in what feels like
[time=1098] the lowest pit.
[time=1101] And then he says these words in dark places, in the depths.
[time=1114] And that may be where others of you are this morning.
[time=1117] Again, verse 1 speaks to circumstances.
[time=1120] And your circumstances may lead you to admit and to say to him, he's been saying it, but maybe this morning, maybe you're saying it for the first time, and just real openness and honesty before him.
[time=1133] My soul is not well.
[time=1137] It's interesting to read in recent weeks about what a soul that's not well looks like.
[time=1147] You know, you can assess this stuff, you can see these things.
[time=1154] A soul that is well will look a certain way.
[time=1157] It will create certain things in your life and mind.
[time=1160] A soul that is sick, a soul that isn't in a place where God designed it to be.
[time=1168] There are some things that you'll notice, and I'll just have him come up on the screen there.
[time=1171] A soul that is not well will find itself anxious.
[time=1174] Your life, your thoughts, your living will be characterized by anxiousness.
[time=1181] There will be more fear than there will be peace.
[time=1187] There will be an anxiousness to your life that marks and characterizes your days.
[time=1193] And many of you in the room understand this.
[time=1195] I do.
[time=1198] I've lived through seasons of time where my soul wasn't well.
[time=1204] I understand this.
[time=1205] Many of you in the room this morning may understand this.
[time=1208] A soul that is not well will find itself self-absorbed.
[time=1212] So many times a soul that is at its deepest part distant from God and characterized by fear and anxiety
[time=1222] then almost by virtue of that becomes a soul and a life that is obsessed with self.
[time=1229] How am I going to get better?
[time=1231] How am I going to get fixed?
[time=1233] How am I going to get all of a sudden everything becomes about you?
[time=1237] We're anxious, we're self-absorbed, we're apathetic.
[time=1243] A soul that's not well sometimes is so weary and tired and distant from him that the things
[time=1252] that you used to care about deeply, the things that used to stir you, used to stir your what?
[time=1259] Soul, all of a sudden we got souls that don't get stirred anymore.
[time=1267] Fearful and anxious, we're consumed with ourselves, we're absorbed with our own desires and needs
[time=1274] we're apathetic and that last one's really important.
[time=1277] Sometimes when a soul isn't well all of a sudden you wake up one day and you realize I haven't talked to anybody in months.
[time=1286] I mean I've talked with people but you understand that a soul that's not well sometimes doesn't want to be around souls that are
[time=1292] and you know sometimes a soul that's not well doesn't want to be around those friends who will ask the right questions
[time=1299] who will push in the right areas who will remind us of the things that we need to be reminded of.
[time=1307] And so this morning you may be sitting here thinking to yourself sometimes it's like this.
[time=1313] You maybe your soul hasn't been well for weeks or months but this morning you take all this in and you just go wow.
[time=1321] My soul is not well.
[time=1324] And I want to do for you this morning what I love having the chance and the privilege of doing that is to pray for you.
[time=1330] And so if you would just as a room would all of you just bow your heads and close your eyes.
[time=1335] And this morning if you find yourself in this place of isolation and apathy, self absorption and fear.
[time=1344] If this morning the truth is your soul isn't well.
[time=1348] That you're weary and you're tired and you're confused and you sense in your heart this longing to be reminded of the
[time=1357] fullness and the strength and the hope that you're good and gracious God can provide.
[time=1364] I want to just come alongside we want to come alongside and pray.
[time=1368] Would you stand just quietly where you are.
[time=1371] It's not an admission of guilt it's an admission of humanness.
[time=1376] And if you would just stand right where you are and just give me what really is a privilege to pray for you.
[time=1384] I want to do that and I want to ask for God's hand.
[time=1387] That hand that the psalmist couldn't see or feel.
[time=1391] I want to pray for that hand to come near.
[time=1394] And sorrows like sea billows roll.
[time=1396] Here is my prayer for you this morning.
[time=1399] Dear good and gracious God, I stand before you this morning with an ache in my heart.
[time=1405] You can just kind of repeat these words quietly in your heart as I pray them.
[time=1410] I stand before you this morning with an ache in my heart and the clear realization that my soul is not well.
[time=1417] I know you will not abandon me or forsake me, but I have to admit in the darkness of these days you have seen distant and silent.
[time=1427] I long for the trials and painful circumstances to end.
[time=1431] I wish that my despair would be replaced by joy that my regret could be erased by the bright promise of a new day.
[time=1440] Oh God, I believe that tribulation and testing can strengthen my faith, but it seems at times as if it is too much.
[time=1449] Father in heaven, I realize that I've stepped away from you.
[time=1453] There isn't the intimacy between us that there once was.
[time=1458] I have wandered away from the word of God, from the spirit of God and from the people of God.
[time=1464] And because of my wandering, I'm lonely.
[time=1468] I'm weak.
[time=1470] I'm sad and discouraged.
[time=1473] And I stand this morning in this place in this moment to beg you for more of your presence.
[time=1480] For strengthen my soul to endure and for hope to hold on to and rest in.
[time=1488] Lord, circumstances are difficult.
[time=1492] But either way, God, circumstantially, I need more of you.
[time=1499] These things I pray, in the name of your Son, and everybody who agreed said, "Amen, you may be seated."
[time=1509] My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought.
[time=1533] My sin not in part but the whole.
[time=1543] Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more.
[time=1553] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[time=1558] O my soul.
[time=1576] I love that line.
[time=1579] My sin, you know, all the bliss of this thought that my sin, not a little bit of it but the what, the whole.
[time=1587] And one of the great truths of redemption.
[time=1589] Some of you know this, others of you may not, but one of the great truths of redemption is what he does with our sin.
[time=1599] He pays for it to be forgiven by the death of his Son, right?
[time=1606] He pays for it to all be forgiven so that we bear it no more.
[time=1612] And not only is it forgiven but all through the Scripture it talks about how he tosses it into the deepest part of the sea.
[time=1621] How it's now as far as the east is from the west.
[time=1626] It's gone.
[time=1628] It's like gone.
[time=1631] Forgotten.
[time=1632] Out of you.
[time=1633] Out of sight.
[time=1634] The forgiveness of God for sin is so thorough.
[time=1639] And you know what it's beyond us.
[time=1641] I've sat here for two hours now this morning looking at this cross that about eight years ago we made.
[time=1648] And I can almost tell you almost with these little chips of tile we passed them out.
[time=1659] And we wrote, we wrote sin, our sins on the back of them.
[time=1667] And then they got unbelievably put on this cross.
[time=1671] And I'm sitting there all morning remembering the shape of my tile.
[time=1675] I can remember dropping it up there.
[time=1678] And today all these years later I'm pretty sure I could tell you what the back of it said.
[time=1683] And it just strikes me that it's on his cross and he has no memory of it.
[time=1688] Amen?
[time=1689] None.
[time=1691] And this second verse is about that.
[time=1696] The second verse isn't so much about is it well with you circumstantially.
[time=1700] The second verse is about is it well with you spiritually.
[time=1706] Can you today sing my sin all the bliss of this glorious thought?
[time=1713] All of it has been covered.
[time=1715] All of it has been forgiven.
[time=1717] All of it has been paid for.
[time=1720] And it really gives us a great opportunity with a room full of people.
[time=1724] Every week there are people in this room who haven't quite got this one wrestled with
[time=1732] and figured out and acted upon.
[time=1735] And so this morning I want to give you the chance to do that.
[time=1738] For those of you in the room who have fully surrendered your heart and life to him, you have bowed the knee of your heart before him.
[time=1746] You have entered into because of the forgiveness that his son provides you as he faces death
[time=1753] and deals with the darkness so that you and I would never have to as we look upon the sacrifice of our Savior.
[time=1760] We've come to a point in time where we've surrendered ourselves to him.
[time=1764] And for you this morning I want you again to be grateful, thankful.
[time=1770] For those of you in the room this morning who haven't, I want to give you the chance to do so.
[time=1777] And I want to just ask everybody in the room if you would just bow your heads and close your eyes and I want to just very simply and succinctly say it to you, those of you in the room this morning who haven't come to that place yet.
[time=1790] I believe God wants it to be well with your soul on this issue of salvation.
[time=1799] On this issue of your sin and the distance that it has created between you and God
[time=1806] and between you and the life he designed you to live.
[time=1813] And I would hope for you this morning we've written down a prayer that maybe would just
[time=1819] represent the things that you're feeling, some of the truth that you're learning.
[time=1827] Maybe this prayer would just be a way of articulating the spirit of God's work as he brings you toward God the Father in this amazing, miraculous act of God
[time=1839] redeeming and making you new.
[time=1844] If you would be willing it would be great for you to stand.
[time=1848] Again it's not an embarrassing thing, it's an amazing thing.
[time=1854] If you don't want to stand you don't have to but let me just read this prayer.
[time=1858] It's a prayer you can pray, these are words that you can say.
[time=1863] And today it can be well with your soul spiritually.
[time=1868] So stand if you would.
[time=1871] Stand if you would, thank you.
[time=1874] And let me say this, let me pray this on your behalf.
[time=1877] These are the words that you could say this morning as you wrestle with and maybe even yield today
[time=1886] to salvation.
[time=1887] I stand this morning God because I see today the great truth that Jesus was willing to
[time=1893] bear and shoulder my sin.
[time=1896] Not a little bit of my iniquity and failure but the whole, all of it.
[time=1902] Dear God in heaven I see now that it will never be well with my soul without the transforming
[time=1910] work of Christ in it.
[time=1913] A transformation made possible only when one fully surrenders their heart and life to you.
[time=1919] Father in heaven I stand before you and this family at this moment in time to do that very thing.
[time=1927] To completely declare my love for you.
[time=1930] My full surrender to you, your loving leadership and your perfect plan for my life.
[time=1938] Oh thank you Lord, for loving someone as sinful and unlovable as me.
[time=1944] Thank you for healing my broken soul and giving me the hope of a life lived with you today
[time=1952] and for all of eternity, these things I pray in the name of your son.
[time=1959] [AMEN - 1 seconds] You can be seated.
[time=1982] The count be rolled back as a scroll.
[time=1992] The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend even so.
[time=2004] It is well with my soul.
[time=2015] You know I'm actually going to have Marianne and Abby, would you come on up now?
[time=2033] I think it will help to have you guys up here for this one.
[time=2037] Verse 3, not so much about circumstantial wellness of the soul.
[time=2044] Not so much directly about are you saved?
[time=2048] Have you been redeemed?
[time=2049] Do you have peace in your soul with regard to salvation?
[time=2053] Although that's sort of implied here, the real thrust of verse 3 is this amazing concept
[time=2060] and truth that all of us who know the Lord and all of us who have either kind of from a young age
[time=2068] grown up with you know faith around us or even in recent days maybe you've come to faith.
[time=2073] It's either way, it's this thing we think about sometimes and that is, is there peace with regard to the end?
[time=2080] The end, the end of this world, the end of our lives, is there peace?
[time=2089] I mean the clouds being rolled back like a scroll, trumpets sounding and the Lord descending,
[time=2097] we all know this isn't make believe, right?
[time=2101] It's really going to happen and you and I may or may not be there in that moment, but you and I are both going to come to an end of this, right?
[time=2110] And then eternity will begin and as you think about eternity, is it well with your soul?
[time=2118] When I was young, hi young one, when I was young and anybody who says they didn't think this
[time=2126] when they were young is an absolute liar and how dare you lie in church, when we were young we used to think, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that sounds good, but please let me get married, please let me have kids, please let me have a life
[time=2144] and when I get like her, I'll be really good with this whole going thing.
[time=2152] You ever think that? Yeah, all right.
[time=2155] So here's the point today and I just think, I think Marianne and Abby are going to just kind of
[time=2161] read, recite to you from Scripture, I think just the great balance that goes on here
[time=2167] as we look at age and life, whether you're older or whether you're younger,
[time=2175] today is a reminder to you that it should be well with your soul as we think about the end.
[time=2182] I know we've got our lists, but it can be well with your soul no matter where you are
[time=2190] when you understand the great truth of what God has provided.
[time=2194] If there's a willingness to go, that's great, there are also some things that the Scripture teaches us that we need to be willing to give ourselves to while we stay.
[time=2204] Listen and be encouraged as Marianne and Abby talk us through that.
[time=2210] I eagerly expect and hope that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body,
[time=2219] whether by life or by death.
[time=2223] I trust that my life will bring honor to Christ, whether I live or die.
[time=2229] For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[time=2240] If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me.
[time=2247] And for me, yet what shall I choose? I do not know.
[time=2252] Yet what shall I choose? I am torn between the two.
[time=2258] So am I. I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far.
[time=2263] But it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.
[time=2268] I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far.
[time=2274] But it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.
[time=2279] Convinced of this, I know that I will remain.
[time=2283] And I will continue with you for your progress.
[time=2287] And I will continue with you for your joy in the faith.
[time=2293] So that through my being with you.
[time=2297] So that through my being with you, your joy in Christ Jesus will overflow.
[time=2303] Overflow on account of me.
[time=2307] [AMEN - 1 seconds] What a great picture of the whole spectrum.
[time=2317] You know, from younger to older, being ready to go.
[time=2320] But yet also being willing to stay and be there for each other.
[time=2324] Would you stand and let's read this together.
[time=2326] Just a great passage from Philippians 1.
[time=2329] And when I say read it together, I mean out loud.
[time=2332] And I'll lead us through this.
[time=2333] But read out loud along with me.
[time=2336] It says, here we go.
[time=2338] I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed.
[time=2343] But will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body.
[time=2351] Whether by life or by death.
[time=2354] I hope you mean that.
[time=2355] For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[time=2361] I am to go on living in the body.
[time=2363] This will mean fruitful labor for me.
[time=2366] Yet what shall I choose?
[time=2368] I do not know.
[time=2370] I am torn between the two.
[time=2372] I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far.
[time=2378] But it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.
[time=2383] Convinced of this, I know that I will remain.
[time=2386] And I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, so that through
[time=2393] my, again, your joy in Christ Jesus will overflow on account of me.
[time=2402] What a great passage.
[time=2404] Thank you, ladies, for being with me up here.
[time=2408] Wow.
[time=2409] What a great, great truth.
[time=2411] We want to give you the chance this morning, having heard all of this and having been given
[time=2418] the privilege of thinking through this song, maybe in a way that you never have.
[time=2422] I don't know if you saw the, I know you saw the picture of Horatio Spafford.
[time=2427] Did you see the telegram there that's been preserved?
[time=2430] I was so struck this morning as I read that first line, "Saved alone.
[time=2435] Did you see what was next?
[time=2437] What shall I do?" And that is such a significant place where we get to meet our good and gracious God.
[time=2447] And I want to just invite those of you that have met him at that place in your lives to sing with Jamie this morning as we just take all that we've talked about and lift it up
[time=2459] as we sing it as well, song together.
[time=2463] When peace like a river tendeth my way, when sorrows as sea billows roar, whatever my
[time=2488] mind thou hast taught me to say, it is well, it is well, with my soul, it is well, with
[time=2513] my soul, it is well, it is well, it is well, with my soul, my sin, oh, the bliss of
[time=2542] this glorious thought, my sin not in part, but the hope is near to the cross.
[time=2565] And I bear it no more, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh my soul, it is well, with my soul,
[time=2593] it is well, it is well, it is well, with my soul.
[time=2623] And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight, the clouds be rolled back as a
[time=2645] stone, the touch of shall resound, and the Lord shall descend, even so, it is well, with
[time=2664] my soul, it is well, it is well, with my soul, it is well, it is well, with my soul.
[time=2693] I love that line when my faith shall be sight, Hebrews 11 says the faith is the assurance
[time=2708] of things, hope for the evidence of things not seen, there will be a day when everything,
[time=2714] and everything you have believed, the one you have placed your faith in, and everything
[time=2721] you believe, you will see, your faith will be sight, and what a privilege it is for us
[time=2727] this morning, what a great 40 minute segue into communion, amen, my goodness, what a privilege
[time=2735] for us this morning is a family, for those of you in the room that know Him, who have surrendered your heart and life to Him, it is well with your soul, either way, I mean
[time=2746] circumstantially, either way, you know Him, and so today as followers of Jesus Christ,
[time=2753] we come to remember His sacrifice, and so use these few moments here to make sure that things are right with Him, it says in 1 Corinthians 11 that you and I are to examine ourselves.
[time=2764] It doesn't mean that you have to be perfect to come and do this, it means that whatever isn't perfect you've sought forgiveness for, you've confessed it to Him, you've done all
[time=2776] you can as far as it depends on you to lay before Him the failures and the flaws, and
[time=2783] having done that you come with a clean heart and you remember the sacrifice, so let's do that together, come and let's enjoy communion.
[time=2799] I can wash away my sin, I can cover everything still, Father darkness deep within my healing
[time=2818] brain, what can make the blood and soul, what can set the ground in free, what can satisfy
[time=2837] my soul, my being asleep, blood of Jesus be by all, all my hope and righteousness, in
[time=2858] your mercy let be found, on your grace and nothing less, hear the sinner call, blood
[time=2875] of Jesus be by all, all the riches that were spilled, to restore me to my King, no more
[time=2896] fear and no more guilt, I am redeemed when I'm finished with His God, I'm finished with
[time=2909] this life, I'm extending free, I'm extending free, I'm finished with His God, I'm finished, I'm
[time=2925] finished with His God, my being asleep, blood of Jesus be by all, all my hope and righteousness,
[time=2943] in your mercy let be found, on your grace and nothing less, hear the sinner call, blood
[time=2961] of Jesus be, blood of Jesus be by all, all your blood, wash away, make me life, be my
[time=2983] soul, blood of Jesus be, blood of Jesus be by all, all my hope and righteousness, in
[time=2999] your mercy let me found, nothing less, hear the sinner call, blood of Jesus be by all,
[time=3022] all my hope and righteousness, in your mercy let be found, on your grace and nothing less,
[time=3040] hear the sinner call, blood of Jesus be by all, hear the sinner call, blood of Jesus be by
[time=3050] all, hear the sinner call, hear the sinner call, blood of Jesus be by all, all my hope and
[time=3075] hear the sinner call, blood of Jesus be by all, hear the sinner call, blood of Jesus
[time=3100] it's all stand together before we take the bread and cup, we're going to sing one more
[time=3106] song that just reminds us of our need for Jesus, a need for his cross and his grace and his
[time=3115] blood, O Lord you've searched me, you know I'll wait, even when I fail you, I know you
[time=3141] love me, your holy presence surrounding me, in every season, I know you love me,
[time=3171] I know you love me, at the cross, at the cross I bound my knee, where your blood was shed
[time=3187] for me, there's no greater love than this, you have overcome the grave, your glory fills
[time=3200] the highest place, what can separate me now
[time=3230] you shield my way, your hand holds me, I know you love me, at the cross I bound my knee,
[time=3255] where your blood was shed for me, there's no greater love than this, and you have overcome
[time=3268] the grave, your glory fills the highest place, what can separate me now, at the cross I bound
[time=3282] my knee, where your blood was shed for me, there's no greater love than this, you have
[time=3297] overcome the grave, your glory fills the highest place, what can separate me now, you
[time=3308] made a way, when you said that it is done, you saw a veil, you made a way, when you said
[time=3329] that it is done, and when the earth fades, falls from my eyes, and you stand before me,
[time=3359] I know you love me, I know you love me, have the cross I bound my knee, where your blood
[time=3380] was shed for me, there's no greater love than this, you have overcome the grave, your glory
[time=3393] fills the highest place, what can separate me now, have the cross I bound my knee, where
[time=3408] your blood was shed for me, there's no greater love than this, you have overcome the grave,
[time=3422] your glory fills the highest place, what can separate me now, you tore the grave, you
[time=3434] made a way, when you said that it is done, you tore the veil, you made a way, when you
[time=3451] said that it is done, you saw a veil, you made a way, when you said that it is done, you
[time=3472] made a way, when you said that it is done, you made a way, when you said that it is done,
[time=3517] it is done, you made a way, when you said that it is done, you made a way, when you said
[time=3525] that it is done, you made a way, when you said that it is done, you made a way, when you said that it was done, you made a way, when you said that it was done, you made a way, when you said that it was done, you made a way, when you said that it was done, you made a way, when you said that it was done, you made a way, when you said that it was done, you made a way, when you said that it was done, you made a way, when you said that it was done, you made a way, when you said that it was done, you made a way, when you said that it was done, you made a way, when you said that it was done, you made a way, when you said that it was done, you made a way, when you said that it was done, you
