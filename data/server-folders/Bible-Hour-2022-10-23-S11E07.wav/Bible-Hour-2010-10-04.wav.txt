[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again everybody, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] We're so thankful that you've tuned in to the broadcast today.
[time=38] And I want you to know that what you're about to see today and what you will see for the next four weeks, I hope, is a series that, in my heart and mine, I think may be the most important teaching series that we've given ourselves to here in quite some time.
[time=55] I want you to know, and this is the truth, I'll lay in bed at night often.
[time=59] I'll sit in my office during the week, many a day.
[time=63] There will be times in my life where I will be struck by the absolute and utter responsibility that God has given me, that God has given us here at Black Hawk to do something, to do something with you and those who call Black Hawk home.
[time=78] And that something, I cannot emphasize how important it is.
[time=83] You see, God has asked, God has commanded that those of us who lead in ministry would provide a ministry to its people that would allow them to grow.
[time=95] That's right, there are nights, I lay there in bed at night and wonder, gosh, are the people growing like they should be?
[time=102] There are days when I wonder, are we providing the kind of food necessary?
[time=107] Are we teaching and equipping in ways where the people who call this place home, be it in that room on a Sunday morning are on this broadcast, are they growing?
[time=118] As you read through the scriptures, especially in the New Testament, as God describes the way churches should function and those who are a part of the church should live, it's clear that the biblical mandate is for you as a believer to grow, to mature, to become more and more like the Lord.
[time=136] And that responsibility, while you own some of that, we own a lot of it, and I just can't tell you how important it is that you be in your life and relationship with him growing.
[time=147] Are you growing?
[time=150] Is there maturity going on in your spiritual walk over these next four weeks?
[time=155] We've put together a teaching series that we've entitled grow or die, because the fact, the sad and scary fact is that as an organism, as a living being, whether it's you, whether it's a baby, whether it's a plant, either we're growing or something's terribly wrong.
[time=174] And I hope today as you watch, and I hope as you listen, that your heart and mind would be open to the growth opportunities that God would have for you.
[time=183] We care about you immensely.
[time=184] We want nothing more than for you to be all that God designed you to be, and for you to be all that God designed you to be, you have to grow.
[time=193] So come and grow with us over these next four weeks.
[time=195] Thank you so much for tuning in today, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=200] [MUSIC - 69 seconds]
[time=273] - This morning, we begin a series.
[time=275] It's been on our hearts for months, and it's something that's very near and dear to my heart.
[time=282] It's something that I think about often, and the series title that we've given it is "Grow or Die." Because the fact of the matter is, God's Word is so very clear on this, for any of us in the room this morning who have professed our love for the Lord and fully surrendered our hearts and lives to Him.
[time=305] The Bible's really clear that we are to be in our relationship with Him and we are to be growing.
[time=314] And I want to just pause here this morning, and I want to take time over these next four weeks to just ask you, are you growing?
[time=324] It's so important.
[time=326] And I hope over these next several weeks you'll understand not only the importance of it, but I hope that you'll open your hearts and your minds today to what God would want to do in you your growth or the lack thereof.
[time=343] I look around the room and I know many of you, and I know many of you are growing, and I'm so thankful, and I hope these next four weeks will only further God's growing activity in your heart and soul.
[time=355] There are others of you though I just want to say to you, if as you honestly assess and honestly answer that question, are you growing?
[time=363] If the answer's no, then there is, because you and I are organisms, spiritually, you know, we're to be alive, and spiritually we're to be growing when there's not growth, there's room for great, great alarm.
[time=379] It's a really big deal, and so I'm thankful for Tony Opligger, pastor Tony Opligger, come on up Tony, if you would, Tony's a part of our family, and also pastoring at Northeast Christian Church, Tony grew up here at Black Hawk, literally grew up here, and what a privilege it was for us 16 months ago to send Tony to pastor that fellowship and to be a part of that family.
[time=401] I'm so grateful for what Tony's doing, I'm even more thankful for the friendship God has given Tony and I over these last few years.
[time=408] We meet on a regular basis to encourage each other.
[time=411] He and I have talked about this series for quite some time, and I felt like really in my heart that it would be best for Tony to start us off this morning, so I hope you'll give him all your attention, hope you'll open your heart and mind what the Word of God and the Spirit of God would have for you today and give Tony a warm Black Hawk welcome, would you?
[time=430] (applause)
[time=439] Good morning.
[time=441] I first just want to say right up front here how very thankful I am to get to stand up here this morning.
[time=450] As Kelly mentioned, my wife Hannah and I, we both grew up here among you, and so I look out and see so many familiar faces.
[time=460] It's truly a blessing to get to serve in this way, and some of you might remember that the last time that I stood here and served in this way, that we announced that Hannah was pregnant.
[time=471] And then on December 14 of last year, Shalom Helene Opliger was born into our family.
[time=480] Five pounds, six ounces of beautiful baby girl.
[time=486] Of course, I'm a little bit biased.
[time=488] This is, yeah, that's her about a month ago, and then there's one more picture here from just this week.
[time=495] She was hanging out with some pumpkins, apparently this week.
[time=499] Shalom is nine and a half months old right now, and she is growing and developing like crazy.
[time=508] It seems like there's a new milestone almost every single day.
[time=511] First it was rolling over, and then it was the all-important peekaboo, and then it was crawling, and now she's saying mama and dada, which is wonderful, and she also says dog, like 30 times a day.
[time=526] We don't even have a dog, so I don't know where that's coming from.
[time=531] And then this week, we got to this point, we ask her the question how big is Shalom, to which she replies with her hands up, and a big smile.
[time=543] Now, I'm going to turn this, all of this, into a sermon illustration, but I have to admit to you that the main reason I'm showing these pictures and saying these things is because I just want to talk about my daughter.
[time=559] It's true.
[time=562] As Kelly mentioned today, we are starting a new series, a four-week series called "Grow or Die."
[time=573] Grow or die.
[time=576] And as he mentioned, it is a series about our spiritual growth.
[time=581] It's about growing in our relationship with the Lord Jesus.
[time=586] And here is the very bottom line of this series.
[time=591] I just want to give it to you right up front.
[time=593] Here's the bottom line.
[time=595] Here it is.
[time=597] When it comes to our spiritual life and spiritual growth, there are only two options.
[time=608] There are only two options.
[time=611] Grow or die.
[time=615] It's kind of like Shalom.
[time=618] I told you I was going to turn this into an illustration.
[time=621] Shalom is growing and developing.
[time=626] But if she was not growing these days, it would be cause for enormous alarm, concern, and immediate action.
[time=638] And this concept is true.
[time=640] We believe for all living things, whether it's animals or plants or babies or those who have been born again through Jesus, all living things are either growing or they're dying.
[time=657] And so that means that this is true for every single person in this room.
[time=666] And certainly in a room this size with this many people, there are those here who are all over the spectrum of spiritual growth.
[time=676] There are those here who right now you are seeking to know whether this Jesus is real.
[time=683] And I want to say if that's you, I am so glad.
[time=685] We are so glad that you're here this morning.
[time=688] There are those who are newer to the faith and those who are older to the faith.
[time=694] There are those who, if you're being honest, you have been recently going this way, going backwards in your walk.
[time=703] And there are those at the same time in here right now, who recently you've been growing a ton and everywhere in between.
[time=712] But I want to say again, the bottom line, it does not matter where you're at on that spectrum, whether you are nine and a half months old in your spiritual growth or 90 years old.
[time=727] This concept is true.
[time=731] Grow or die.
[time=735] And as Pastor Kelly and I have talked and prayed about this series, it has seemed good and right for us to not, in this series, focus on the how to of growing.
[time=749] There certainly is a time and a place to get into the how to of spiritual growth.
[time=755] So with this series, we desire to go a layer deeper, if you will, into the soil to examine just a few of the foundational pieces,
[time=767] the foundational pieces that must be in place for our growth in our walk with our king.
[time=775] And so today, here is the foundational piece.
[time=780] This is the thesis or the main point of the teaching this morning.
[time=785] And here it is. It's going to come up on the screen.
[time=791] Growth comes as we see a greater glimpse of God.
[time=800] Our spiritual growth comes as we see a greater glimpse of him.
[time=810] Let's pray together again this morning and ask him for just that.
[time=815] Let's pray.
[time=822] Father, you are a great and mighty king.
[time=826] And you are seated on a throne high and lifted up right this moment.
[time=831] And we want to have our hearts set upon you.
[time=834] We want to be submitted to you.
[time=836] And we pray. I pray again, as I have so often this week, that you would give us a greater glimpse of yourself during these moments.
[time=847] I pray that you would open the eyes of our hearts to see more of you and to see you more accurately.
[time=856] Pray that you would be king and that you would have your way here this morning.
[time=860] We pray in the name of Jesus and everybody agreed and said, "Amen."
[time=866] A.W. Tozer, a name that perhaps some of you are familiar with.
[time=870] A.W. Tozer wrote in the knowledge of the Holy Page 7, this wonderful quote,
[time=876] "What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us." It's a very insightful quote, I believe.
[time=889] What comes into our minds when we think about him is the most important thing about us.
[time=897] Think about this with me when I ask a question.
[time=902] What comes into your mind, I mean this seriously, think about it.
[time=906] What comes into your mind when you think about God?
[time=912] When you shut your eyes to pray, what comes into your mind?
[time=919] When you stand in here and sing together as you just did a few moments ago,
[time=926] what do you think he is like?
[time=930] When you open your Bibles to read them, what are your thoughts about him?
[time=938] Brothers and sisters of Black Hawk, I believe that when it comes to what we think about God,
[time=946] that we often, myself certainly included on this one, that we often tend to put him in a box, kind of like this.
[time=958] We think sometimes that he is like this.
[time=964] We think that he is this powerful and this holy and this compassionate.
[time=971] We think he is able to do this much in the world and in my life.
[time=978] We think that he loves me this much.
[time=982] Sometimes we think God is like this.
[time=989] Then something incredible happens.
[time=992] Then we study his word and we serve him and others.
[time=999] We walk through the trials of life and we share life together as the church.
[time=1006] The next thing you know, our box gets a little bit bigger.
[time=1014] We no longer think God is like this.
[time=1016] No, we think he is like this.
[time=1019] We no longer think that he is this powerful and this holy and this compassionate.
[time=1024] No, we think he is this powerful, holy and compassionate.
[time=1029] We no longer think that he is able to do this much in the world and in my life.
[time=1035] We think he is able to do this much.
[time=1038] He doesn't love me this much.
[time=1039] No, he loves me this much.
[time=1044] Then you guessed it.
[time=1047] We study God's word more and we serve more and we walk through the land in between more
[time=1056] and we hang out with the church more and the box gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
[time=1068] But here is the reality brothers and sisters.
[time=1073] Here's the reality.
[time=1075] Our God is so big and so powerful and so amazing.
[time=1083] His ways and his thoughts are so infinitely higher than ours that our view of him, what
[time=1093] comes into our minds when we think about God is way too small.
[time=1102] No matter how hard we try, I would argue, no matter where we are at on that spectrum of
[time=1109] spiritual growth, we all put him in a box, so to speak.
[time=1119] And this is primarily true because to try to sum this all up in one word this morning,
[time=1128] this is primarily true because God is ineffable.
[time=1136] He is ineffable.
[time=1139] Ineffable might be a new word to you this morning.
[time=1143] We actually sang it in one of the songs a little bit ago.
[time=1147] In fact, Kelly turned to me during, at the beginning here and he, I think, mockingly
[time=1153] asked if I would sing that line at this point because he heard that I'm not a very good
[time=1159] singer as he was standing there next to me.
[time=1161] I'm not going to sing it.
[time=1162] It's a new word perhaps, but I want to say that it is a great word.
[time=1168] Ineffable means beyond description.
[time=1174] And if you're filling out those notes, that's one of those blanks beyond description.
[time=1180] Ineffable means incapable of being expressed in words.
[time=1186] It is a word that describes that which is indescribable.
[time=1193] Our God, the God revealed in the Bible, is indescribable.
[time=1199] He is infinite.
[time=1201] He is bigger than our boxes.
[time=1204] He is literally beyond description.
[time=1209] He is ineffable.
[time=1213] Exodus chapter 19.
[time=1217] I want to invite you, if you have your Bibles with you, to turn to Exodus chapter 19.
[time=1224] We're going to start there this morning and we're going to start there because the biblical context and setting for our entire study this morning is one location.
[time=1236] And that location is Mount Sinai.
[time=1241] Mount Sinai.
[time=1244] And the text tells us in Exodus chapter 19 that after God rescued his people out of
[time=1251] the land of Egypt, that he brought them to Mount Sinai.
[time=1257] And it was there at Mount Sinai where God's people saw a greater glimpse of him.
[time=1268] Or we could say it was there where their boxes got a whole lot bigger.
[time=1275] And what's interesting is that from Exodus chapter 19, all the way to the end of the
[time=1282] book of Exodus chapter 40, the people are there at Mount Sinai.
[time=1287] And in fact, the entire book of Leviticus is given while the people are there at Mount Sinai.
[time=1294] And Numbers chapter 1 through chapter 10 take place while the people are at Mount Sinai.
[time=1303] So from Exodus 19 to Numbers 10, the people are camped out there at the foot of Mount Sinai.
[time=1313] And it says that they're there for almost an entire calendar year.
[time=1317] And while they are there, God, our God is revealing himself to them.
[time=1324] In other words, he is giving them a greater glimpse of himself.
[time=1332] And with this greater glimpse, they saw, these people saw that God has number one, ineffable power.
[time=1343] He has ineffable beyond description power.
[time=1350] Exodus chapter 19 will pick up in verse 16.
[time=1359] It says, "On the morning of the third day, the third day that they're there at Mount Sinai,
[time=1366] there were thunders and lightnings." If you can imagine this stuff, just think about being there at the foot of the mountain.
[time=1374] And a thick cloud on the mountain.
[time=1378] And a very loud trumpet blast so that all the people in the camp trembled.
[time=1386] Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God.
[time=1391] Think about that.
[time=1392] And they took their stand at the foot of the mountain, verse 18.
[time=1398] Now Mount Sinai was, it says, "wrapped in smoke because the Lord Yahweh had descended on it in fire."
[time=1407] The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln and the whole mountain it says, trembled the whole mountain trembled greatly.
[time=1419] And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke.
[time=1426] And God answered him in thunder.
[time=1431] Again, if you are able, imagine being there at the foot of the mountain with all of your people,
[time=1438] with the deafening sounds and the brilliant lights and the blazing fire and the trembling mountain.
[time=1446] And it says that when these people saw a greater glimpse of him and his power,
[time=1454] it says all the people in the camp trembled.
[time=1459] No kidding.
[time=1462] And remember, these are the very same people who had already seen a glimpse of his ineffable power.
[time=1470] Many of you this morning are familiar with the story.
[time=1473] Remember, God's people, the Israelites, had been in slavery in Egypt for generations.
[time=1482] They had been there for up to 400 years in slavery in Egypt.
[time=1488] And then, as the story goes at just the right time, God instructed Moses to go to the king of Egypt
[time=1497] and to say something like this, "Farrow, Pharaoh, oh baby, let my people go."
[time=1508] I mean, something like that. And then after that exchange over a course of weeks, God did it.
[time=1515] He rescued his people from Egypt.
[time=1519] And it says in Deuteronomy 5, 15 and other places that he did so with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.
[time=1528] Remember, he poured out those plagues upon them while they were there.
[time=1533] And in essence, he dismantled the social and economic and religious systems of Egypt, one of the world's leading superpowers at the time.
[time=1544] And then even after that, and the Pharaoh had let them go, and still he sent his army after the Israelites.
[time=1552] And so in Exodus 14, you can read about that, we see a helpless and defenseless nation of slaves against the oncoming Egyptian army.
[time=1568] And then, again, as the story goes, God defeats one of the most powerful and technologically advanced militaries in the world, and he does so with water.
[time=1586] That is power. And in the next chapter, when the people get to the other side of the Red Sea, they all sing together.
[time=1598] And one of the things that they sing about Exodus 15, 6 is his glorious power.
[time=1605] And so in Egypt, at the Red Sea and now at Mount Sinai, the people, the Israelites saw a greater glimpse of God's ineffable power.
[time=1619] Think about this this morning.
[time=1622] This, he is the God who spoke and the universe leapt into existence.
[time=1632] He is the God who right this moment holds all things together, Revelation 4.11.
[time=1641] He is the God who is able to shape world affairs at the highest level, and who at the very same time is able to provide every single meal for every single lowly creature.
[time=1657] No doubt, he is the God who is able to do immeasurably, exceedingly abundantly more than all that you or I could ever ask or imagine, because he has ineffable beyond description power.
[time=1677] And not only that, he is greater still. Amen? Let's try that again. Amen?
[time=1688] When the people there at Mount Sinai saw a greater glimpse of him, not only did they see a little bit of his ineffable power, but they also saw his ineffable holiness.
[time=1702] His ineffable holiness, his beyond description, holiness.
[time=1709] The word holy in the Hebrew is caddosh. Caddosh. And many of you know that holy or caddosh means to be set apart. It means to be completely other than.
[time=1724] God's holiness means that he is completely and utterly and thoroughly pure.
[time=1733] In other words, he does not mix with or come in contact with evil or sin in any way, shape or form, not even a hint, not even a whisper, because he has ineffable holiness.
[time=1751] And one of the things that happened there at the foot of Mount Sinai is that God instructed his people to build a tabernacle, a dwelling place for him. You see a picture here?
[time=1766] An artist's rendering of the tabernacle. The source here for the picture is the ESV study Bible, which I highly recommend to anyone. That's a side note.
[time=1776] The tabernacle, which we see here, was to be a central part of their life as God's people.
[time=1784] In fact, it's interesting. Thirteen chapters in the book of Exodus. Thirteen chapters are dedicated to describing its construction.
[time=1796] And then the entire book of Leviticus centers around the prescription. He prescribes what they are to do in and around this structure.
[time=1806] And this tabernacle was designed in part to teach them about his holiness.
[time=1817] In fact, at the heart of the structure there, you can kind of make it out in the picture.
[time=1823] There was a room called the Most Holy Place. Many of you know about this, and it was separated not just from the rest of the tabernacle, but from the rest of creation.
[time=1835] By a very thick veil or curtain. And God prescribed that on one day of the year, one person, the high priest, could go behind that curtain into the Most Holy Place.
[time=1854] Because he is that other. He is that holy. And so it makes sense then that throughout the biblical narrative that almost any time that someone gets a greater glimpse of him, they see a glimpse of his holiness.
[time=1873] When a young prophet by the name of Isaiah saw a glimpse of God seated high and lifted up on his throne. Part of what Isaiah saw was this vision of great angelic beings crying out to one another.
[time=1889] They cried out holy, holy, holy, ineffable holiness. Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The whole earth is full of his glory.
[time=1907] And the foundations of the threshold shook at the voice of him, who called Isaiah reports, and the house, the temple was filled with smoke. Verse 5 of Isaiah 6, and Isaiah said, "Woe is me."
[time=1925] Isaiah gets this greater glimpse and he says, "Woe is me. I am lost. I am undone." For I, he says, "I am a man of unclean or unholy lips." And I dwell among the people of unholy lips. For my eyes have seen the king.
[time=1951] My eyes have received a greater glimpse and Isaiah's response, "Woe is me, for I am unholy compared to his ineffable holiness."
[time=1966] And from Revelation chapter 4, clear toward the very end of the Bible, we know, and this is amazing, we know that God is seated on that throne right this moment.
[time=1984] And there are powerful angelic creatures who are right this moment proclaiming, "Holy, holy, holy." It says day and night they proclaim it. And that means that when we were standing here singing a bit ago, and when we do that again in a few moments, they will be saying, "Holy, holy, holy."
[time=2008] And when we get in our cars and go home and sit on our couch and watch football today, they will be saying, "Holy, holy, holy." And when we lie down on our beds tonight, and then through the night, and when we wake up, first thing, they will be saying, "Holy, holy, holy."
[time=2031] Our God has ineffable beyond description holiness, and He is greater still. Amen?
[time=2044] [AMEN] And finally, while the people were gathered there at the foot of Mount Sinai, they also saw a glimpse of His ineffable love.
[time=2057] His ineffable beyond description love.
[time=2063] While the people were gathered there at Sinai, another of the things that happened is that Moses went up on that mountain.
[time=2072] And in Exodus chapter 33, you can read about it there, Moses has this incredible exchange with our great God.
[time=2082] And part of what happens there is Moses boldly and humbly asks God this question. He says, "Please show me your glory."
[time=2097] "Please show me your glory." Exodus 33, 18, in other words, Moses asks for a greater glimpse of God.
[time=2109] And what is so amazing is that God responds and He says, "I will do that."
[time=2117] And in Exodus chapter 34, He does. Exodus 34, verse 5, "The Lord descended in the cloud and stood with Moses there,
[time=2131] and proclaimed the name of the Lord, the name of Yahweh.
[time=2135] The Lord passed before Moses and proclaimed the Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious."
[time=2145] So think about this. This powerful and holy God also is merciful and gracious.
[time=2157] It says He is slow to anger. You can say hallelujah to that.
[time=2164] And He is abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. He is abounding in steadfast love.
[time=2178] Some of your translations might say abounding in loving kindness or in love or in goodness or grace.
[time=2185] And the Hebrew word used there is chesed. Chesed. And chesed, although it doesn't sound beautiful, is actually a beautiful concept.
[time=2197] It's actually a covenant word. And so this could be defined as covenant love or loyal love or even closer, I think, extreme loyal love.
[time=2215] Chesed is extreme loyal love. And here it says, God is abounding in extreme loyal love for His people.
[time=2228] And if you read through the rest of the Hebrew Scriptures, which we often call the Old Testament, the Psalmist proclaimed this same thing.
[time=2235] The prophets declared it. And when King Solomon finished building the temple, which was a more permanent structure to replace that tabernacle.
[time=2245] When he did that, it says that fire came down and the glory of the Lord filled the temple.
[time=2251] And when that happened, the people fell face down before Him. And they proclaimed with one voice, two chronicles, seven.
[time=2260] Picking up at the end of verse three, they proclaimed, for He is good for His steadfast love. His chesed endures forever.
[time=2274] His extreme loyal love endures forever.
[time=2282] On the next slide, you'll see a picture of a bird. Specifically, that is a stork. A stork.
[time=2291] And the ancient Hebrew people, it's very interesting, they noted that these birds, the storks, were different, especially as it related to their young.
