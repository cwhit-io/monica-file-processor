[time=530] It's every word with my soul
[time=545] It is well with my soul
[time=591] Hey, if you've been around at all you know that these last couple of weeks we've started
[time=610] a new teaching series that we've entitled Grow or Die talking about the absolute importance
[time=617] the vital necessity of your spiritual growth and mine grow or die so thankful for Pastor
[time=624] Tony Opeliger who came two weeks ago Tony taught us about the fact that growth occurs when you and I get a greater glimpse of God.
[time=633] When our view of God is what it should be when we understand more deeply and more personally his character and his divine nature when we get a picture of God that's really clear and really accurate and really overwhelming it prompts us, it spurs us on in our growth
[time=650] it was a phenomenal message.
[time=652] Last week I came and tried to teach and talk about and we had a great discussion about
[time=658] the environment of growth.
[time=660] There is an environment within which plants and flowers and crops grow and there is an
[time=669] environment in which they don't.
[time=672] We talked about the environment for spiritual growth and we found a lot of similarities in spiritual growth that's why it's used so many times in the scriptures as an analogy
[time=683] spiritual growth and physical plant growth we talked last week about the importance of the soil of salvation how no one grows remember Ephesians 2 dead doesn't grow spiritually nobody
[time=699] grows unless their heart has been redeemed unless they have been spiritually made new
[time=706] we talked about the soil of salvation we talked about the water of the word we talked
[time=712] about how the word of God acts like water and it refreshes us and it nourishes us and it feeds us and it allows us to have all the nutrients if you will needed to grow strong
[time=724] and mature we talked about the soil of growth being salvation the water being the word of
[time=730] God we talked about the light that was needed the light of confession bringing sin into the
[time=737] light because things don't grow in the what in the dark and we talked about the care the
[time=744] tender loving care that we give our plants and our flowers we talked about the care of community the great joy of the one and others the opportunity you and I have to live in
[time=756] relationship with each other up close and personal spurring each other on to love and
[time=762] good deeds caring for each other meeting each others needs saying the truth in love when
[time=768] the truth needs to be spoken if you missed it last week I hope you'll go to the website
[time=774] you can watch that message there online the environment of growth and it brings us today to what we've entitled the journey of growth the journey of growth all through the scriptures
[time=786] we see people at different places along the path of spiritual formation I hope you understand
[time=793] that there is a there is a journey that we take there is a road that gets traveled spiritually
[time=802] as we grow in our relationship with the Lord and all through the scriptures we find examples and we see things that allow us to understand better this this path of spiritual formation
[time=814] and I believe it's really really important that you and I understand where you are on
[time=821] this journey of growth I think it's really important that you and I understand where
[time=828] where you are on this journey of faith and I hope today and next week we can do a good
[time=836] job and a faithful job of teaching and engaging you in this discussion so you can better understand
[time=843] exactly where you are on this path of spiritual formation that God has you on it you can see
[time=849] on the stage the four the four stops if you will along the way there are those who find
[time=856] themselves at the stage of exploring Christianity and we're going to talk about that this morning
[time=862] some will find themselves some of you in the room this morning some of you watching the broadcast today others of you listing online you find yourself at a place where you're really just starting out you've got some questions that you feel like need to get asked you haven't
[time=877] made a commitment to Christ but for some reason God's got your attention and maybe some Christ
[time=884] following friends have engaged you in a healthy discussion and you're you're starting to move in that direction that direction is the cross there are some who come to faith in Christ
[time=895] they bow the knee of their heart they fully surrender their hearts and lives to him and having done that the scriptures teach us that the angels rejoice the church certainly certainly
[time=906] celebrates but that is really in some ways just the beginning some explore and then come to faith and then there comes the opportunity having come to faith to to start what Paul
[time=917] describes in 1 Corinthians 9 as this amazing race of spiritual development and spiritual
[time=924] maturity the beginning of it all brings with it a unique season in the life of a young believer
[time=933] and then oftentimes folks move from being a young believer to a stage of real growth they
[time=939] move to a place in their life where they've come to faith in Christ by God's grace they've learned and experienced some of the foundational fundamental truths that were needed to give
[time=951] them kind of a grounding in their relationship with him and now they begin to grow now they begin to practice these truths in ways they never have before it's an exciting time of growth but even this time of growing isn't really the end because there is a there is
[time=967] a fourth stage in the path of spiritual formation where people who have been growing for a while
[time=973] then have a choice to make and that choice is am I going to be consumed with Christ am
[time=984] I really do I really truly want to taste what it's like and to experience what it means
[time=995] to really fully surrender to live on the edge to throw all the chips in the middle to absolutely
[time=1007] and thoroughly be consumed by Christ and what it means and what it looks like to follow
[time=1016] him wholeheartedly radically turn the world upside down kind of stuff these are steps
[time=1028] along the way and I think it's really really important that you understand where you are
[time=1034] on this God designed path this God designed road of growth why number one let me just say
[time=1042] this to you why is it so important that you know where you are Colossians 128 I want you to read this this is kind of the bedrock this is almost kind of a foundational verse for us in ministry here at Blackhawk this is something I think about daily this is something we talk about all the time around here Paul said it we echo it and most of you know this
[time=1064] is true but this is just how we view it we proclaim him who's him say it Christ we make
[time=1071] it our we make it our commitment to be a place in the people that proclaim and make much of Jesus we proclaim him and as we proclaim him Paul says admonishing every man and teaching
[time=1086] every man with all wisdom will beg you will confront you will exhort you will admonish
[time=1094] you will teach you will do anything we have to do with all wisdom not ours but his we proclaim
[time=1102] him admonishing and teaching every man why so that we may present every man everybody say
[time=1108] that word complete do you understand that we sense I sense an enormous responsibility
[time=1118] and opportunity it's a privilege to stand before God someday and be held accountable
[time=1127] for my part of it I think there's a part that's God's obviously and we're talking about your
[time=1135] your completion and I think there's a part that's yours the Scriptures seem to indicate
[time=1142] though that we're responsible as well to teach you and admonish you to stop at absolutely
[time=1150] nothing to be engaged in this process of completing you started here and you ended where here
[time=1161] and in the middle there is a lot going on and I want you to understand and I want to
[time=1168] know where you are in this process because we pray all the time and we ask God and beg
[time=1176] him for help to complete you and for me to complete you I got to know where you are I
[time=1182] don't treat Russell and Evie the same way doesn't make it bad it's just how it is we
[time=1188] got different things going on there's different things that are needed there's different approaches that are healthy make sense nod your heads alright Colossians 128 really important in
[time=1200] the why is it so vital to know where you all are secondly I want you to know where you are
[time=1206] so you can be thankful so you can be thankful for where he's brought you amen I know a lot
[time=1216] of you and I know a lot of you have a ways to go but I know a lot of you aren't where
[time=1222] you were amen I know that he has been faithful to grow you I know I've watched him be faithful
[time=1229] to carry you through I have watched him teach you things I have watched him bring disciples
[time=1235] into your life I have seen you mature in your faith and I want you to see today and next
[time=1241] week I want you to identify where you are on this spiritual growth continuum because I want you to be thankful for all that he has done and thirdly I think it's important that
[time=1255] you know where you are whether you're here or whether you're here or whether you're here I think it's important that you know where you are because I think it's really important that you know what's next does that make sense where there is no vision the people what perish
[time=1272] I want you to be where you are and there are things that God is doing in you where you are but wherever you are I want you to have a really clear view of what's coming next
[time=1283] and where God wants to take you and what that entails and what that involves it's very important that you know where you're going this was powerfully illustrated to me just a couple
[time=1294] of weeks ago when I had the gosh it was a privilege it was a horrifying scary privilege
[time=1302] but it was a privilege Jesse Hannah our student ministry lead pastor and a bunch of the student
[time=1308] ministry staff guys invited me a couple months ago they said hey pastor would you ever think
[time=1315] about going whitewater rafting with us and never having been whitewater rafting ever
[time=1325] in my life only hearing stories and seeing pictures but sensing the energy in them and
[time=1331] the excitement in them and they described it to me a little bit that sounded a little rugged and oh yeah they were going to camp out which I don't do I said to them with all
[time=1343] the energy I could muster absolutely I'll go whitewater rafting with you and they're
[time=1349] just like yes this is going to be so much fun so I have no idea what I'm in for I have no idea where we're going I find out as the weeks and months go by that again just two weeks ago on a Sunday afternoon I got in the activity bus with Jesse and JE and JMO and
[time=1364] Adam Jones and Tim Geary and Scott Mills and Gary Bishop and we drove to West Virginia
[time=1372] to the Gully River and we were had a reservation for Monday morning to spend about six six
[time=1379] and a half hours on what is called the upper Gully and I learned I'm learning all this as
[time=1386] I go there's a key theme here I want you to pick up on I didn't really know what I was getting into fully as we're moving into this process though I'm realizing that what I've signed up for is the upper Gully River of the Gully River there in West Virginia which
[time=1400] the upper Gully is comprised only of class 5 and class 4 rapids a class 5 rapid those
[time=1409] of you who don't understand rapids I didn't either it was just a class 5 rapid is is a
[time=1415] death trap a class 5 rapid is you better make it through because if you don't it was just
[time=1424] amazing we camped out that first night we're in the bus on the way up to the to the drop off point in the upper Gully and the guys passing out sheets of paper having a sign it so that our families won't sue them if we die he's just saying these kinds of things to us and it's getting more and more intense as we go come to find out they've just released
[time=1444] the water from the reservoir above we're in the height of class 5 class 4 season the
[time=1451] rivers running at some astronomical number I never could figure out what the number meant you know 28 3800 cubic feet per second I don't know it was just crazy as you got
[time=1461] closer to it you could hear it and I'm thinking oh God take me home I mean not like kill me
[time=1469] but somehow turn this bus around and let me go home with my pride and my life intact
[time=1475] anyway here's the point we get on the river and it's really intense and before we would
[time=1483] get to a rapid it would be incredible you would go through a rapid and you could hardly hear yourself think it was so loud and the waves are so big and the waters running so fast
[time=1495] and we get through a rapid and then our guide his name was Devo and he was this guy that
[time=1501] just lived on the river he lived in the mountains he was a mountain dude and he was really cool and he loved us and he wanted us to live and not die and so he took it really serious
[time=1512] and every time we'd be about to go through a rapid he'd pull us over he'd paddle us over the side calm waters and he'd say now look at me he's serious and look at me listen to me here's what's going to happen we're going to drop into this baby and we're going to go left and then all of a sudden there's going to be a rock and then we're going to go to the right and then we're going to drop about 10 feet and it's going to feel like you're dying but you're not just listen to me and do what I say because at the bottom of that you're going to go underwater but we're going to come up and then we're going to have to go to the left again and I'm just sitting there in this boat going you've got
[time=1544] to be kidding me and everything Devo would say about the next rapid because Devo knew
[time=1552] all the rapids you with me everything he said about every rapid was true and everything
[time=1560] he said about every maneuver we were going to have to pull off was absolutely right and knowing about it before we ever got there was helpful now I want to show you some pictures
[time=1571] because I know you got this middle picture in your head right now so here's a few pictures of us on the upper gully these are these are calm waters actually so I don't know why JE's
[time=1581] about to lose his lunch but there's JE in the front I'm in the back there with Jesse that's
[time=1587] Devo behind me with the with the war helmet on that's Devo and Scott Mills and Adam Jones
[time=1593] and JAMO and Gary Bishop another picture there's a great great time this is us this
[time=1601] is more more about this in a second this is us on a rock called pillow rock and pillow
[time=1607] rock didn't really go so well but I'll keep going well there there you go see pillow rock
[time=1613] didn't go so well there's JAMO and Jesse and Scott in the water and I know right now you're all thinking gosh I wish you had a video Kelly go ahead somebody said I got one
[time=1627] okay roll it here we go you're going to just be blown away by this when you just see the intensity of the look look look at this it's like the the water is so fast and it's so
[time=1639] big it just puts up this steam the splat like a Devo he's pointing you see him he's pointing
[time=1645] he's telling us where to go paddle back paddle forward it's absolutely unbelievably intense
[time=1655] and everything he told us was right and everything he said worked except we got into a little
[time=1662] trouble okay watch this we got into a little trouble at a place called pillow rock and I've
[time=1671] been waiting all week to say this down that thing come around here comes the rock and
[time=1681] he said to us now when we get to the rock keep going and I'm gonna have you pause it
[time=1687] right there stop it right there all right he said this has nothing to do with the message I just been waiting all week to tell you this he said when you get to the rock don't worry about it because we're just going to brush the bottom of the rock he said we're just going to brush the bottom well he tells us later that we didn't brush the bottom of the rock because the raft was so heavy and you guys are so big and he looks at me when he says that and so we're supposed to brush the bottom of pillow rock but we actually
[time=1717] climb pillow rock and I had him pause it right here because also on the bus on the way up with the paper saying don't sue us if you die the guy told us if you ever fall out of him raft in a level five you better say your prayers he said the water will just take you
[time=1734] to the bottom of the river and it'll hold you down and if you fight it you'll drown he uses these words he says so don't fight it if you fall out of the boat let it just take you where it's going to take you and come up whenever you can come up oh thank you very much for your encouraging word so we got all these young yay who's in this boat talking
[time=1752] about how all they've been whitewater rafting six seven eight times you know the the guide finds out when we get there I've never gone he's like you're not supposed to be on this trip I said thank you again for the encouraging word so now that's just a backdrop now watch what happens on the top of pillow rock with all these expert rafters boom but keep going
[time=1774] keep going yeah yeah look at him look at him look at him I'm back there in the backward divo we get up on top of this rock and as soon as we start to go down I start thinking
[time=1784] about that stop right there everybody's out but who huh everybody's out but me they're
[time=1797] just floating they're just floating they're down the bottom of the river begging for life I have no idea where to go now okay here we go in the spiritual growth discussion it
[time=1810] helps to know where you're going it really does it prepares you for that journey and that is a preparation that I want desperately for all of you so let's look at the scriptures this morning and learn more about the journey of growth and the steps the stops along the
[time=1827] way and it begins as I said earlier with the question mark exploring Christianity would
[time=1833] you open your Bibles to the book of Acts the book of Acts chapter 8 the book of Acts chapter
[time=1840] 8 verse 26 let me just say this to you if you're here in the room this morning if you're
[time=1846] watching the broadcast you may be in this stage of exploring Christianity and I just want
[time=1853] to know how thankful we are for that what's going on you may not realize it I'll teach you a little doctrinal theological truth here in just a minute what's going on is a thing that we call efficacious grace efficacious grace what's going on in you very likely is
[time=1870] that the Spirit of God is stirring in you the Word of God maybe has gotten into you you've
[time=1878] been exposed to the truth that changes lives maybe a Christ following friend has started
[time=1886] to engage you in discussion and I'm just telling you what's going on there is the Spirit of God is beginning to stir in you and God who is the author of what he is the author of salvation
[time=1897] God begins to draw you to himself it is an amazing amazing ride we see examples of seekers
[time=1907] we see examples of those who were searching we see examples in the Bible of those where the Spirit of God is moving and they're responding and I want you to see one here in Acts chapter
[time=1917] eight verses 26 to 35 it says but an angel the Lord spoke to Philip saying get up and
[time=1926] go south to the road that descends from Jerusalem to Gaza this is a desert road so we got up
[time=1933] and went and there was an Ethiopian eunuch a court official of Candice queen of the Ethiopians
[time=1940] who was in charge of all of her treasure and he had come to Jerusalem to worship and he
[time=1946] was returning now on the road on the side of the road sitting in his chariot and was reading
[time=1952] the prophet Isaiah so here's this Ethiopian eunuch this official who's in charge of the
[time=1960] queen of Ethiopia's treasure he has seen much do you understand he has seen wealth he has
[time=1969] seen all that life has to offer he has seen enormous success he has seen the royalty of the queen he has served her faithfully and he's reading the Bible so to speak trying
[time=1982] to figure things out and it says there that he's reading the prophet Isaiah then the Spirit
[time=1989] said to Philip the Spirit said to Philip go up and join this chariot and Philip ran up
[time=1997] it's what you and I should do when the Spirit moves us when the Spirit prompts we should respond he ran up it says and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and said do you understand
[time=2009] what you are reading and the Ethiopian eunuch the one exploring said well how could I unless
[time=2018] someone guides me and he invited Philip to come up and sit with him in the chariot now
[time=2024] the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this he was led as a sheep to slaughter and as a lamb before its shear is silent so he does not open his mouth in humiliation
[time=2035] his judgment was taken away who will relate his generation for his life is removed from
[time=2044] the earth the eunuch answered Philip and said please tell me of whom does the prophet say
[time=2053] this of himself or of someone else and then Philip did what you and I so oftentimes don't
[time=2059] do Philip did what you and I too many times fail to do in the moments and in the circumstances
[time=2071] that God provides you and I with the guy asked a question the guy needed some help and Philip
[time=2083] what opened his mouth he spoke sometimes you and I need to speak up we need to say something
[time=2092] I love how it says it here he opened his mouth and beginning from this scripture he preached
[time=2100] Jesus to him and we proclaim who him he preached Jesus to him as they went along the road it
[time=2108] came to some water in the eunuch said look water what prevents me from being baptized
[time=2114] the eunuch was curious the eunuch had something stirring inside of him exploring Christianity
[time=2122] my friends it's an amazing season of life this is when your thoughts and questions about God the Bible your life and its purpose lead you to start reading blogs and books you never
[time=2134] used to read you all of a sudden have this amazing growing curiosity with the Bible and
[time=2141] truth you're asking significant spiritual questions about things that a month or a year ago you could have cared less about you watch Christ followers in your life live out their
[time=2155] faith and again in contrast to a week ago or six months ago it's not weird to you all
[time=2164] of a sudden now it's compelling to you all of a sudden now it's inviting you're showing
[time=2171] up here at a Sunday morning gathering faithfully week after week you haven't done anything faithfully your whole life now all of a sudden you're faithfully here week after week you're
[time=2184] watching the broadcast or you're listening online week after week with the hope that maybe maybe this week it'll all get a bit clearer let me say to you those of you in
[time=2195] the room those of you watching who find yourself in this season of exploring Christ and Christianity
[time=2201] what a great place to be amen what a phenomenal experience I had the joy Sunday night at the
[time=2209] welcome to Black Hawk at a room full of people it was great and we were going around just saying hello and I was so encouraged to meet this gentleman and his wife and they said
[time=2221] right in the front row and the first thing she said to me and the whole room was hi my
[time=2227] name is and she gave us her name and she says and I'm a seeker it just burst out of her
[time=2235] mouth she said it with a glow in her eyes she said it with a smile across her face she
[time=2242] is so thrilled these days to be moving closer and closer to a relationship that she knows
[time=2249] and now senses is going to transform her life and it's how she introduces herself to us
[time=2256] I'm a seeker John three we see another seeker in the scripture Matthew Mark Luke John Axe
[time=2264] go back from Axe to the third chapter of John we meet a guy named Nicodemus who was on a mission he had some questions that needed to get asked he had some issues that needed
[time=2275] to get addressed now there was a man of the Pharisees that says in John three one named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews this tells you how important he was this tells you how much he knew about religion at least it tells you that in the religious world of the Jews he
[time=2292] was esteemed and greatly respected this is why he comes to Jesus by night because he knows he can't come to him by day there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews this man came to Jesus by night and said to him Rabbi we know that you have come from God as a teacher for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him I've
[time=2317] always thought this was interesting Jesus answered did he ask a question no Jesus just
[time=2326] knew what he was thinking and he's all nervous and he's coming by night doesn't really roll
[time=2333] out with the question that's really in him and Jesus in his divine nature just cuts right through and answers the question that never got asked and said to him truly truly I say
[time=2345] to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said to him how okay Nicodemus is now you got me so here we go how can a man be born when he is old
[time=2357] he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born can he Jesus answered truly
[time=2363] truly I say to you unless one is born of water and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[time=2369] of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit
[time=2376] do not be amazed that I said to you you must be born again the wind blows where it wishes
