[time=31] [MUSIC - 72 seconds]
[time=105] (audience applauding) - Well, hello again.
[time=112] Welcome all of you who are tuning in today to the Bible Hour.
[time=115] My name's Kelly Bird.
[time=116] And I have the privilege and it is that to serve on the team here at Black Hawk Ministries and to be a part of a team that brings you every week this broadcast of our worship service here at Black Hawk.
[time=128] If you've been watching over the last several weeks, you know that we're in a series that we've entitled Grow or Die.
[time=135] And it is of the utmost importance.
[time=138] We see as we read the scriptures, God's word places an enormous priority on growing, on spiritually becoming more and more of the husband, the wife, the man, the woman, the young person, the senior adult, living in relationship with Christ that God's called you to be.
[time=157] The scriptures are really clear that when you're growing, when your spiritual life is progressing toward the things that God has called you to, that's healthy, that's good, that's what God designed.
[time=170] As he designed it with every living thing, growth is necessary.
[time=175] When you're not growing, and I hope that as you've watched, or I hope as you watched today for the first time, if you are not growing in your spiritual life, I hope you'll realize as with any other living thing, this is cause for alarm.
[time=190] This isn't good, it isn't healthy, and it's not what God designed, and so we wanna do our best to come alongside and help you grow.
[time=198] I hope as you take the time to maybe go back and watch on our website, the messages in the Grow or Die series, I hope as you download the Digging Deeper material from the Grow or Die series, which you can do on our website.
[time=213] The Digging Deeper material helps you during the week interact with the message from that week on a deeper level.
[time=220] It allows you to bring application to your life from the truth that we taught that week.
[time=226] I hope as you watch, I hope as you continue in your study that God and His Word and His Spirit will spark a growth movement in you that will bring great glory and honor to Him and encouragement to your life.
[time=239] I wanna tell you about one opportunity that we wanna make available to you.
[time=245] You'll hear me talk about it today, but it's our Grow Groups that we're starting on Thursday night the 28th.
[time=251] As you watch this, we'll already be one week into those, but I wanna make a special invitation to those of you in our viewing audience, Grow Groups.
[time=260] These are chances for you along the spiritual growth continuum as an explorer, as a beginner, as one who is growing or one who's wanting to be consumed with Christ.
[time=273] Either one of those four, we have electives that we're offering on Thursday night.
[time=277] You can come and be a part of a group that's learning more about that stage of your spiritual journey and also learning what important next steps there are for you to keep moving in that process of growth.
[time=291] There's information about our Grow Groups on our website.
[time=294] We'd love for you to come and be a part of it, even if you're part of another church, even if you don't go to church on a Sunday morning.
[time=299] Come be a part of this family on Thursday nights as we do our best with God's help to keep growing together.
[time=306] Grow Groups, Thursday nights come and be with us and be a part of that.
[time=311] We'd love to have you go to the website if you have any questions at all.
[time=314] Don't hesitate to contact us.
[time=316] Thank you.
[time=317] Thank you very much for tuning in today.
[time=319] I hope you're encouraged.
[time=320] I hope you'll keep growing and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=325] - For the month of October, Kelly's been taking us through a compelling series called Grow or Die and the gist of it, if you haven't been with us until today is this.
[time=336] When it comes to our spiritual life, we're doing one of two things.
[time=339] We're either growing or we're dying.
[time=341] There's really no in between.
[time=344] Last week, Kelly introduced to us some stages of spiritual growth.
[time=349] After you know Jesus, he highlighted three of them.
[time=351] We're beginning our journey with Jesus, growing in Jesus and then consumed by Jesus.
[time=357] We're gonna hear more about that today.
[time=360] But before we do from Kelly, we wanted to show you an interesting and I think memorable drama.
[time=366] The drama team brought this to our attention and we thought it would be a good thing to show you.
[time=371] I would be surprised if any of you forget this drama for quite a long time.
[time=375] And I'm gonna challenge you as you watch this scene in a kitchen unfold to look for the spiritual truth that lies underneath the surface.
[time=383] So let's enjoy this together.
[time=385] - Thanks again for inviting us over you guys.
[time=388] We've been really eager to meet some new people since joining your church.
[time=391] - We know exactly what you mean.
[time=393] When we first started visiting Black Hawk, the people were great, but it took us a while to start making those connections.
[time=399] - Luckily, bit by bit, we began to spend time with people outside of church.
[time=402] And it just helped us to get to know them better.
[time=404] And then by extension, other people through their introductions.
[time=408] - Wow, you know, and they've made it so easy.
[time=411] Just because everybody there was so friendly, at least that's what we found when we started going.
[time=415] Have we blessed the food?
[time=416] - Oh, we did while you were in the kitchen.
[time=417] Everybody dig in.
[time=418] - Oh, Sally, this looks absolutely delicious.
[time=421] - Sally really is a great cook.
[time=423] Now she doesn't like to admit it, but she actually plays 13th in this past Christmas's fruitcake cook-off.
[time=428] She's kind of a big deal.
[time=431] - I know it's something I would really love to learn how to cook, but for some reason, I just can't seem to get the hang of it.
[time=436] - It's true, even the microwavable stuff gives her fits.
[time=439] I'm sure it's something you'll pick up quickly if you practice a bit.
[time=443] Sally, do you mind?
[time=444] I'm really hungry.
[time=445] - Not at all, sweetie.
[time=447] Now I hate to change the subject, but Rick, I have got to ask you a question.
[time=452] - Yeah, go ahead.
[time=453] - Did you go to Northern Heights High School?
[time=455] - I did.
[time=458] Because I seem to remember a tuba player who looked a lot like you.
[time=465] - Sally, this food is delicious.
[time=471] You have outdone yourself tonight.
[time=472] - I know, I'm in the zone.
[time=475] - What just happened?
[time=476] - Sally here, she has the best long-term memory.
[time=481] She never forgets a face.
[time=483] Tuba, huh?
[time=484] I mean, you struck me as more of a percussion kind of guy.
[time=486] I do a little tickling in the ivories myself.
[time=488] We should totally jam sometime.
[time=490] - Yeah, photographic memory is my sixth sense.
[time=493] Oh, wait, snap.
[time=495] Got you both forever now.
[time=496] - No, no, it wasn't the memory thing.
[time=499] It was the-- - Excuse me.
[time=501] Excuse me.
[time=502] Here comes some bread, sweetie.
[time=503] - Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.
[time=506] - Oh, would you like me to give you some pep dough?
[time=507] - No.
[time=508] - No, jeez, tell me how you really feel.
[time=511] - Okay, everybody just stop.
[time=513] You're chewing food and spinning it out on his plate, which he then eats.
[time=517] Why?
[time=519] - Well, I'm feeding him duh.
[time=521] You know, we're actually training the dogs to do the same thing.
[time=524] You can never be too prepared.
[time=526] - Why in the world would you do that?
[time=533] - Rick, I'm sorry.
[time=534] I thought we told you.
[time=535] I have soft teeth.
[time=538] - It's so bad.
[time=539] I have to rely on Sally to chew my food for me.
[time=542] - Oh, wow, sorry.
[time=543] - That makes so much more sense now.
[time=546] (audience laughing) - Don't worry about it.
[time=551] (audience laughing) Who'd like some more corn?
[time=556] Isn't there anything you can do about it?
[time=561] - The doctor has prescribed a calcium treatment, which could build the strength in my teeth back up, but I don't really like taking the pills.
[time=568] It's much easier for me to have Sally just chew my food for me.
[time=571] And I am a pretty gifted chewer.
[time=574] (audience laughing) - I can see that.
[time=578] But wouldn't you ever just like to chew your own food?
[time=583] I mean, you gotta lose some of the experience and the flavor with all that chewing.
[time=589] - Okay, maybe a little bit, but I haven't chewed my own food in so long.
[time=592] I probably wouldn't even do it right.
[time=594] I thought I read somewhere you're supposed to chew 15 times for every 45 seconds.
[time=599] Wait, no.
[time=600] - 45 times for every 15 seconds.
[time=604] No, hold on.
[time=604] Okay, this is exactly what I'm talking about.
[time=607] - But aren't you afraid that you might lose some nutritional value in the transfer of your meals?
[time=613] (audience laughing) - Yeah, it's like dressing yourself.
[time=618] - Yeah.
[time=619] - You know, you try on different outfits, you find out what doesn't, doesn't look good on you, and eventually you develop your own style.
[time=624] - Right, I mean, it's how Sally dresses you every day too, right?
[time=628] - Oh, no.
[time=629] - That's right.
[time=629] - No, what gave you that idea?
[time=630] - No.
[time=631] - How many of you does?
[time=632] - I'm gonna go get the dessert.
[time=634] - Listen, all I'm trying to say is you can't rely on someone else to provide you with what you need.
[time=640] That's something you've gotta do for yourself no matter how hard it is.
[time=643] - Who would like some warm cherry pie?
[time=646] - Oh boy, look at the time.
[time=647] Come on, honey, I think we need to go.
[time=649] (audience laughing) - Not every actor agreed to be a part of that.
[time=655] Seeing there were just those brave four that were willing to do it.
[time=659] Hey, did you notice a couple of things?
[time=661] One, that couple just acted so nonchalant about something that was really repulsive.
[time=667] And I find myself too often acting nonchalant about immature believers staying immature.
[time=675] You know, Paul talks a lot about stages of maturing in Christ.
[time=678] And at the beginning, we do need to have milk for infants as it were, but there needs to be a point where the infant grows into a child, grows into a teenager, grows into an adult in their hearts.
[time=691] And I don't wanna be nonchalant about something that's spiritually repulsive as much as that was maybe visually repulsive to some of you.
[time=700] Can I read a verse for you this morning to just remind you of the Bible's insistency that we grow up in Christ.
[time=707] Hebrews five, I believe Kelly read this too as last week, but I thought it'd be good to look at again.
[time=713] In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again.
[time=721] You need milk, not solid food.
[time=724] Anyone who lives on milk being still an infant is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness, but solid food is for the mature who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.
[time=740] So my encouragement to you this morning, don't stay a spiritual infant, grow up in Christ.
[time=746] At some point you need to pass along that baton from your discipler to yourself and grow up in Christ and then begin to pass that on to other people as we help others grow up in Christ like we've gotten the chance to do.
[time=759] So Kelly's gonna talk to us more about that today.
[time=762] Thanks for enjoying that memory with me.
[time=766] So.
[time=767] - There you go, Pastor.
[time=768] - You're welcome.
[time=769] Thank you very much.
[time=770] How you feeling about lunch right now?
[time=774] (audience laughs) I'm just curious.
[time=776] Hey, I am thankful to be back in this discussion with all of you in the room this morning.
[time=781] Those of you watching on the broadcast, a great discussion we started last week about the stages of spiritual growth.
[time=788] It was good to see in the scriptures how we see all through the word of God people, groups of people and individuals in different stages of growth.
[time=797] And I'm so hoping last week had several conversations with people, it was very encouraging.
[time=804] Hoping that you'll be today, even as many of you were last week, identifying where you find yourself, where God has you on this continuum of spiritual growth.
[time=815] I want you as we begin to please pull out the white insert that's in your bullets and everybody, please.
[time=820] Pull out the white insert, the grow groups opportunity.
[time=823] We're gonna come back to this at the end of the morning, but I want you to have that out and you can even be looking at that as we make our way through the discussion this morning last week.
[time=833] We looked at those who are exploring Christianity.
[time=837] That is symbolized by the sign there in the back.
[time=840] The question mark, we looked at those who are having explored balcony of their heart, come to faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and begin.
[time=849] Start out on their spiritual journey.
[time=852] We looked at those who are exploring and those who are beginning.
[time=856] We looked at those two last Sunday.
[time=859] I do wanna mention this.
[time=860] I think it's good to note that there are those who are exploring, but I wanna just make sure we're all remembering that designation leaves out a group of people who I think are worth mentioning because there are those outside the family of God who aren't exploring, who are far from God and want nothing to do with God.
[time=890] And because of whatever circumstances or whatever upbringing or whatever mindset they find themselves pretty hostile toward the things of God.
[time=899] Not reading books or blogs they didn't used to read, not interested in books or tapes or anything.
[time=905] It was just out there.
[time=907] And I hope that your posture toward them, I hope our treatment of them would be respectful.
[time=914] I hope there would be an ache in your heart like there is in mind for anybody who hasn't yet experienced the grace of God.
[time=923] And it's just a good reminder for us to always be ready to interact, to always be ready to extend a hand, to always be ready to extend kindness toward those, even those who aren't necessarily right on the verge.
[time=939] You with me?
[time=940] So we've talked about explorers and beginners.
[time=943] Now we come this morning to this third category of growth.
[time=946] You see it symbolized here by the sprawling oak.
[time=949] We call it the growing phase.
[time=950] Ephesians four gives us some insight into this phase.
[time=954] Would you, in honor of God's word, would you stand?
[time=958] And would you allow me the privilege of reading this to you this morning?
[time=961] Ephesians chapter four versus 11 through 15.
[time=965] We've read it before.
[time=966] I want you to see this again.
[time=968] Paul writing to the church at Ephesus says and he God gave some as apostles.
[time=974] And some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers.
[time=981] He's talking about what God has given to the church.
[time=987] And he gave them all those different offices, if you will.
[time=991] For what?
[time=992] For verse 12.
[time=993] For the equipping of the saints for the work of service to the building up of the body of Christ.
[time=999] He gave the church pastors and teachers so that they could equip the body so that the body could do the work of the ministry.
[time=1009] A great truth to be reminded of.
[time=1011] How is this supposed to progress?
[time=1013] Well, until we all attain this is to go on in the church.
[time=1017] Until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a mature man.
[time=1024] To the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[time=1029] This is how we're to come at this as a result.
[time=1032] We are no longer to be children.
[time=1035] We are no longer to be beginners.
[time=1038] We're no longer to have food chewed for us.
[time=1043] Tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men by craftiness and deceitful scheming.
[time=1051] No, but instead, verse 15.
[time=1053] But speaking the truth, which is what we do here, speaking the truth and love, we the body are to grow up.
[time=1062] We are to grow, not die.
[time=1066] We are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head even Christ, amen?
[time=1073] Pray with me, would you Father in heaven?
[time=1075] We stand before you this morning, hoping and expecting God desiring for your word and your spirit to move in us today.
[time=1084] Father, God, I pray that for this family who comes before you today, God, for this body here at Blackhawk, for those in the room and for those watching.
[time=1093] God, I pray that you would speak clearly.
[time=1096] I pray that you would convict.
[time=1097] I pray that you would remind.
[time=1099] I pray that you would unveil and reveal new truth.
[time=1102] God, I pray that you would do what only you can do and that is meet us where we are in a thousand different ways, on a thousand different fronts and give us exactly what we need to grow, to be nurtured in the stature, as it said there in Ephesians 4, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[time=1126] This is our desire and this is our hope, God, that you would grow us in this way and all the people in the room agreed and said, amen, you can be seated.
[time=1134] So where are you this morning?
[time=1137] Do you find yourself in this third phase that we're calling the growing phase?
[time=1141] You've explored faith in Christ.
[time=1143] You've fully surrendered your heart and life to the Lord.
[time=1147] You've been through a very important beginning phase.
[time=1151] Strong foundations have been and continue to be laid.
[time=1156] And now you begin to sense growth on multiple fronts.
[time=1162] The Word of God and the Spirit of God that now dwells in you are changing and transforming you.
[time=1169] You begin to sense this.
[time=1171] You begin to see it in your life.
[time=1174] Maybe it's been happening for you in the last few months.
[time=1178] Maybe for some of you in the room, it's just been in the last few weeks.
[time=1181] Maybe others of you in the room can remember years ago when this was first happening in your life.
[time=1192] Growth in this growing stage.
[time=1198] You begin to see and realize how your faith should permeate all arenas of your life.
[time=1204] When you first started out, it wasn't quite that way.
[time=1206] When you first started out, when I first started out, there was a tendency to compartmentalize our faith.
[time=1212] We had our faith and we were thankful for our faith, but sometimes our faith was here and then there was this part of my life and then there was this part of my life and then there was this part of my life.
[time=1223] Raise your hand if that makes sense.
[time=1225] See what you learn as you grow in your relationship with Christ and what you learn as you grow in your understanding of the word is that the spiritual life as my grandpa used to tell me isn't a TV dinner.
[time=1237] Some of you young kids don't know what TV dinners are.
[time=1240] I remember being a little kid.
[time=1242] You remember TV dinners?
[time=1243] All the little compartments, right?
[time=1247] And he used to tell me it's not a TV dinner, it's a pot pie.
[time=1250] You with me?
[time=1253] No compartmentalization.
[time=1254] Your faith just mixes up with every arena of your life and as you're growing, you begin to see this.
[time=1264] You begin to sense.
[time=1266] You begin to spend more time alone with the Lord and the Word of God.
[time=1271] Your prayer life is deepening and expanding beyond your list of wants to the things that you pray for and beg God for as it relates to confession and other people and their needs.
[time=1285] You're starting to serve others.
[time=1288] You're sensing this desire on you to actually go beyond you and serve others and their needs inside these four walls and outside these four walls.
[time=1299] You're beginning to see the blessing that comes with sacrificial financial giving.
[time=1305] You begin to understand that we're not all about money and I don't want your cash that money and gifts and giving and resources when given sacrificially for the kingdom, not for a man.
[time=1317] God uses to do amazing things.
[time=1320] It blesses you and it furthers the kingdom and it's a good thing.
[time=1324] You're starting to see and realize this.
[time=1326] You're realizing the great benefit, the great fruitfulness and joy of community, of life together.
[time=1333] You're realizing how important it is that you not try and walk this road alone, that you not try and face all that this life brings without the support and encouragement and truth speaking of a small community of people who love you and care for you and are committed to walking alongside.
[time=1350] Here's a really cool one.
[time=1351] The more you grow, the more you grow and the more you experience the love of God and the grace of God and a deeper knowledge of God and his character, the more, the more you want those in your life that don't know him to know him.
[time=1366] It didn't used to stir you the way it does now.
[time=1370] You used to live life alongside people who were lost and searching and it didn't really phase you and now all of a sudden as you grow, you begin to realize, oh my goodness, I would just love it if he or she or they could come to faith in Christ.
[time=1386] You start to beg God to redeem those in your life who you love and long to see saved.
[time=1391] You're growing.
[time=1393] You're in a growing stage, what a great place to be.
[time=1396] I thought about it this past week and I want to just do this, just take a few minutes.
[time=1400] I thought about it this past week and then I thought about some of the, just a few of the life-changing truths that God taught me.
[time=1410] I just thought for a moment this week about some of the life-altering principles in God's word that when I was growing, I kind of knew about them but as I was growing, they began to sink in and they began to mark my life and they began to reshape how I lived and how I thought.
[time=1427] Many of you I'm sure will identify with this.
[time=1429] I just wrote down three.
[time=1431] Three truths, three biblical principles.
[time=1436] As we're growing, we get a better understanding of these things.
[time=1440] I hope this is going on in you.
[time=1441] The first one I wrote down was forgiveness.
[time=1443] I remember being a growing believer and all of a sudden the light goes on and I begin to see the depth and the breadth and all that was involved in the forgiveness of God.
[time=1456] It blew me away.
[time=1459] It encouraged me and it did some things to me in my own, not only view of him but my relationship with others.
[time=1465] Just write down forgiveness and look at Ephesians 1-7 if you will.
[time=1469] If you go back to Ephesians 1-7, it's there that you see Paul again writing to the church at Ephesus and he says in 1-7, in him we have redemption through his blood.
[time=1478] The forgiveness of our what?
[time=1480] Say it, trespasses according to what?
[time=1484] According to the riches of his grace, which verse 8 says he lavished on us.
[time=1492] Blew me away, the more I grew, the more I understood forgiveness.
[time=1496] The forgiveness of our trespasses, don't forget that.
[time=1504] Every fence you've jumped, every line you've ever crossed over,
[time=1511] every sign you've blown by, he forgives you.
[time=1521] Because of his grace and because of his mercy, he forgives us.
[time=1529] The forgiveness of God when you're growing in this sink sin, wow, it's a life changer, it really is.
[time=1536] I wrote down the power.
[time=1538] I wrote down the power over sin.
[time=1541] I wrote down this great truth, this great biblical principle, the power that God provides us in our willingness to face and fight sin.
[time=1551] I wrote down Romans 6, would you turn there?
[time=1554] Go back to Romans 6.
[time=1556] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, go to Romans 6.
[time=1560] Let me hear those pages turning, come on.
[time=1562] Romans 6.3, this doesn't come out and say it, Romans 8.11 comes out and says it, but I wanna read Romans 6 'cause it is thoroughly and completely kind of referenced or implied.
[time=1577] Listen, or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus, those of you in the room who have fully surrendered your hearts and lives to him?
[time=1587] Don't you know that those of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into his, what?
[time=1593] His death.
[time=1594] Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death so that as Christ was raised from the dead, through the glory of the Father, so we too might be raised from the dead.
[time=1611] So we too might walk in newness of life.
[time=1616] For if we have become and we have, united with him in the likeness of his death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection.
[time=1627] Knowing this, that our old self was what crucified with him in order that our body of sin might be done away with so that we would no longer be slaves to sin.
[time=1642] Romans 8.11 says it so well.
[time=1647] And when you look at Romans 8.11, when you look at Romans 6, here's the deal.
[time=1650] Our body of sin, listen, what a great truth.
[time=1654] Our body of sin and the power of sin has been trumped
[time=1660] by the power of God.
[time=1663] The power of God that raised Jesus from the dead, the same power resides in you.
[time=1672] Same power.
[time=1677] Not sort of the same power, the same power that God used to raise Jesus from the dead is accessible
[time=1690] and present the scriptures teach in you when you're in him.
[time=1695] Wow.
[time=1699] I think about forgiveness.
[time=1701] I think about power over sin.
[time=1703] Here's one that I learned early on in my beginning phase, learned more about it in my growing phase.
[time=1708] Many of you have come to appreciate this.
[time=1711] God is for me.
[time=1715] God is for you.
[time=1717] You heard that taught early on.
[time=1719] It thrilled your soul, Romans 8.
[time=1721] Go over to Romans 8.31 and 32.
[time=1725] How many in the room have come to that point where you and your growing phase read this, had this taught to you and it just left you, wow, wow.
[time=1734] It just left you amazed that the God of the universe would be for you.
[time=1739] What then shall we say 31 of chapter eight to these things?
[time=1744] If God is for us, who is against us?
[time=1749] He, here's where, listen, he who did not spare his own son but delivered him over for us all.
[time=1757] How will he not also with him freely give us all things?
[time=1764] God is for you.
[time=1768] So many of you grew up thinking he was against you and then you learned in faith that he's for you.
[time=1773] What great truth.
[time=1775] And all of that, the forgiveness component, the power over sin component, the God being for you component, all of that on the growing front is good.
[time=1783] Really, really good.
[time=1789] But, but sometimes something happens here.
[time=1794] All of that's getting taught and all that's getting taken in
[time=1805] and all of that's getting learned and you and I are becoming, first of all blown away by it, then we're not careful we can become familiar with it.
[time=1818] Sometimes something happens.
[time=1820] Sometimes the spiritual growing slows down.
[time=1825] Sometimes it begins to fade.
[time=1832] And sometimes, sometimes it just flat out what?
[time=1836] Stops.
[time=1838] Why?
[time=1842] You know why?
[time=1848] You encounter various trials of many kinds, it says in James one, that thoroughly just discourage and defeat you.
[time=1858] You get to this phase where all of a sudden enough things have happened and you're just not sure about God anymore and how good and loving he is.
[time=1867] Sometimes it is the busyness that let's be honest you create in your life.
[time=1873] And sometimes after months and let's be honest years of busy living what was stirring you and transforming you at one point now becomes familiar.
[time=1887] Sometimes it slows down.
[time=1891] Sometimes it fades.
[time=1893] Sometimes it stops.
[time=1894] Sometimes it stops or is slowed by a besetting sin.
[time=1901] A struggle that just seems to stay with you and never go away.
