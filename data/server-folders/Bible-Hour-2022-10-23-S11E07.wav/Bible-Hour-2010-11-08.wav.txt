[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Today is National Orphans Sunday.
[time=35] It's something that's rather new, but a Sunday set aside for churches across our country to just take some time to acknowledge the fact that there are 15 million orphans in our world today and to acknowledge the fact that God calls us as a church body to respond to the needs of the orphan and the fatherless.
[time=56] And so we wanna join with churches across the country today in setting aside some time to acknowledge both those things.
[time=64] I'm curious in a room this size, how many of you have been involved in the three things that splashed up on the screen at the end and said foster care, adoption and orphan care.
[time=76] If any of you in the room have been a part of one of those three things, would you please just stand to your feet for a minute?
[time=84] Adoption, orphan care, foster care in bigger small ways.
[time=87] Yeah, we can clap for these people.
[time=89] (audience applauds) I'm thankful for all of you who stood
[time=100] and I just wanna say that I know that what you've done isn't easy and I know that it requires sacrifice and courage.
[time=107] And so we thank you for doing that.
[time=109] And speaking of sacrifice and courage, here's my friend Andrea.
[time=115] She is a member of the choir and a good friend of Tanya and I had asked her to join me up here today to talk a little bit about orphans because only a month ago she was holding some in Nairobi.
[time=127] Many of you know that we sent a team from Black Hawk of about a dozen people over to Kenya and they got a chance to love on some babies.
[time=135] And my friend Andrea has just told us a bunch of stories and I asked her if she'd share them with you.
[time=140] She said that serving in Africa for two weeks was a lot easier than being on this stage for two minutes with me and all of you.
[time=149] So please give her grace and just, I'm sure you'll love what she has to share.
[time=153] You did an awesome job last hour sharing with everybody what you experienced and learned.
[time=158] So initially Andrea just say hello to all of them.
[time=161] Hello family.
[time=163] Okay.
[time=164] She is gonna fill you in on some of what the orphans were like in Kenya specifically, you spend time at New Life Home Trust, right?
[time=174] Yes, most of our time was spent at New Life Home.
[time=177] New Life, consisting of seven homes throughout the Kenyan area.
[time=182] We were primarily at the main home that is located right in Nairobi, which houses children from birth through about three years of age.
[time=190] Good, and New Life Home Trust is actually several other orphanages as well.
[time=197] I think this picture is another picture that you spend a little bit of time at, also a part of New Life Home Trust.
[time=202] And we did, this home is also in Nairobi.
[time=205] It is a few blocks over from the main home.
[time=208] And this is the home that probably taught me the most about our adoption by Christ.
[time=217] This is the home where the children that are labeled unadoptable go.
[time=222] Unadoptable be due to their age or to a diagnosis.
[time=228] And as I look at that picture, in man's eyes, half of those people are unadoptable.
[time=236] And I am just thanking God that in his eyes, none of them are unadoptable.
[time=242] How easily he could have said to me, Andrea, she has issues.
[time=248] She's gonna take some coddling through some hard times in life.
[time=253] She's gonna be a little bit more than I wanna put into it and to label me unadoptable, but he doesn't do that.
[time=260] No, he certainly doesn't, and I'm thankful, I'm thankful.
[time=264] Some other pictures that I asked her to show you today are of orphanages that weren't a part of New Life Home Trust.
[time=271] That's the orphanage that we have the privilege of sponsoring and sending volunteers to, but these pictures are of a different orphanage.
[time=278] Tell them about this one.
[time=280] - We spent part of a day at this orphanage in Cabera, which is one of the largest slums in the world.
[time=288] It's a direct contrast to New Life Homes.
[time=291] New Life Homes does everything right.
[time=294] They love on their children.
[time=296] This one was just cold and it was dark
[time=302] and you did not feel the love in this home.
[time=306] And by the time I walked out, I was just literally weak and sick at thinking of the lives that these children live day in and day out.
[time=316] - A little bit different home.
[time=318] Tell them about those shoes that this little girl's home.
[time=321] - Those shoes came from a friend of mine, her little daughter.
[time=327] I was picking up clothes to take and she had two pairs of sandals there and she said, "Which one of those sandals would you like to give?" And she wasn't really sure she wanted to give either one of them.
[time=340] And I loved it how she got down and she explained to her that halfway around the world is a little girl that doesn't have any shoes.
[time=347] And you have two.
[time=348] And then I was able to hand-carry those over there and give them to this gal that had no shoes.
[time=356] And she was just so thankful.
[time=358] - No shoes at all and now a pair of sandals.
[time=362] It's really cool.
[time=364] Andrea also spent a lot of her time with one orphan in particular and she wants to just kind of brag on him a little bit today.
[time=371] He stole your heart, huh?
[time=373] - He more than stole my heart.
[time=375] His name is Moses and this is pretty much every time I held him what happened.
[time=381] Very first day he was the first baby that I held and his little hand came out and squeezed my finger.
[time=387] And for about a solid 20 to 30 minutes he sat there at those big brown eyes and just stared intently into me as I prayed over him as I sang over him.
[time=398] And Moses had only been in new life home about three weeks when we arrived.
[time=403] Prior to that he had spent two months in the hospital recovering from where he was found in a dirty, cold, dark, chicken coop where he was left abandoned to die.
[time=415] - And you got to spend some time with him?
[time=420] - I got to spend a lot of time with him.
[time=422] The routine pretty much knew Moses was mine.
[time=424] - Nobody else could hold him except for you.
[time=428] That's really cool.
[time=429] So here's my question for you now Andrea.
[time=431] You've been home about a month and now we splash a video on the screen with statistics about orphans and we talk about opportunities to give and invest in the lives of orphans.
[time=444] How do those statistics and those service opportunities impact you differently today?
[time=449] Now that you've been over in Nairobi and you've held them and you know their names and what's different today?
[time=456] - Just that, they're not a statistic to me.
[time=459] I have sat where all of you have sat and seen the statistics and I've always had a heart for orphans and so I have always studied the statistics.
[time=467] I got a feel through that for your adoption through Tenash and I just, they're not statistics.
[time=475] It's Moses, it's Brianna, it's Faith, it's Carl.
[time=480] I can go on and on.
[time=483] They are of real lives with real names.
[time=488] Without adoption we'll spend their lives unadoptable and in orphanage.
[time=493] I'd encourage anybody to go.
[time=496] There's a lot of opportunities, maybe you're saying you can't up and go.
[time=502] A lot of you helped us get there financially.
[time=505] A lot of you helped us by supporting us through prayer and encouragement.
[time=509] You know God is bigger than anything.
[time=513] I didn't think that four weeks from today instead of singing in C.W.B. that I'm gonna be worshiping in Cabera but that's where God is voting me and I'm excited to go back.
[time=525] - Yeah, she's going back again in four weeks to spend some time doing a vacation Bible school in the slums so we're excited about that for you and excited to pray for you and support you again.
[time=537] It's been fun to watch God take her on a journey and can you thank her for what she shared of that journey with you today?
[time=543] (audience applauds) - The Brandenburgers are headed up this way now too.
[time=557] I thought it would be good for us to pray for the orphans in the world and good for us to pray for what God might be stirring in your heart right now and how to respond to the needs of the 15 million orphans that we face now in our lifetime.
[time=572] This is Matt and Abby and they, as you can see, have a couple beautiful girls that they've adopted here locally and so they're gonna pray for us today and I'm thankful that you guys are doing that for us.
[time=584] - Let's pray.
[time=585] Father in heaven, we just come before you this morning and we're just so thankful for this morning that we celebrate and think about the 15 million orphans all over the world.
[time=602] It's just an incredible number that we can't really even fathom, Lord, but I thank you that in your word, you say that you are a father to the fatherless and I just pray that this morning and each day that you would just make yourself known to those who do not have a father or do not have a fatherly presence in their life, Lord, I thank you that you are a God that loves each and every one of us and that we can call you Abba Father and we can know you in a personal way even though you are the God of the universe, the creator of all things.
[time=642] We thank you for adoption and what a picture
[time=649] of your sovereignty it is and how you've blessed our family and the many other families in our church body that we've had the privilege of getting to know and just the way that we've seen you work in each of our lives.
[time=666] Lord, I pray for our church body as a whole that we would be a place that is adoption friendly, that we would be a place that would look for opportunities to share with others and the joy that it brings and for caring for the widows and orphans all over our community and around the world as well.
[time=689] Lord, we just commit this morning to you and pray that we would listen to the spirit leading and working in each of our hearts so that we can carry out your work here in our community and all over the United States and around the world.
[time=709] Thank you again for this time and these things we pray.
[time=712] [AMEN]
[time=714] [MUSIC]
[time=717] A local body of believers at church who comes to the aid and defends the powerless, I wanna be a part of a place like that.
[time=730] I wanna be a part of a place that that tries to mirror the heart of God.
[time=737] And so that's what we're after and we love it.
[time=740] We love it that you're here.
[time=742] If you're watching on television and we love that you're watching, if you're listening on the internet, we love that you're doing that too.
[time=748] We wanna help you pursue a God.
[time=750] There is no one like our God.
[time=754] And whatever you're going to, whatever fountains that you're drinking from that aren't his well springs of pleasure, they will never satisfy you.
[time=762] And we wanna introduce you to you and further grow you down the line of your relationship with this God who loves, who is eager to be in relationship with you.
[time=774] Would you find the prophet Micah in your Old Testament?
[time=776] Here's how you find it.
[time=778] The last 12 books of the Old Testament are called minor prophets.
[time=781] They're called minor 'cause they're short, not 'cause they're unimportant.
[time=785] They begin with Hosea and they end with Malachi.
[time=788] So if you go to Hosea, turn right and you'll find Micah, about midway, if you go to Malachi, the last book of the Old Testament and turn left, you'll find Micah again after a few pages.
[time=799] So find Micah, if you would please, in your Bibles.
[time=804] We're gonna be in the sixth chapter of Micah just for a moment as we begin this morning.
[time=808] Micah chapter six verses six through eight, I could not but read these verses with you as we begin this morning in light of Orphan Sunday, in light of all that you've just heard.
[time=820] Micah six verse six says with what shall I come before the Lord and bow myself before God on high?
[time=826] Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves are year old?
[time=830] Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, with 10 thousands of rivers of oil?
[time=836] Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
[time=841] He has told you, oh man, what is good,
[time=847] and what does the Lord require of us?
[time=850] To do justice, to love kindness,
[time=856] and to walk humbly with your God.
[time=860] May we this morning do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly before God as we serve him today.
[time=871] Let's pray as we begin.
[time=872] I do pray, I am so grateful that Matt called you this,
[time=878] and that we are again calling you Father today.
[time=883] We can call you Father because of your great love.
[time=886] We love you God because you first loved us.
[time=888] And so thank you.
[time=891] Thank you for what you've done.
[time=894] Thank you for what you will do.
[time=896] May we be eager to serve you Father, both here and around the world.
[time=899] We pray all these things in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=903] The first time I spoke with you on this stage was about three or so years ago.
[time=908] I talked about a question, is God an ego test?
[time=913] Do any of you remember that?
[time=914] Are you around for that?
[time=916] We were in the prophet Isaiah, and Isaiah frames that it's very appropriate for God to insist that we worship him only.
[time=925] And as Micah opens, I am impressed that we're kind of circling back to the same message again.
[time=932] A man named Adolf Safir said this, how human is the God of the Old Testament, the God who appears, who speaks, who guides, who loves and is loved, even as the man of the New Testament, Christ Jesus is divine.
[time=951] Would you go left in the book of Micah to the first verse of the book, Micah 1 verse 1?
[time=956] We want to talk to you just for a minute about why this theme was chosen for our study.
[time=962] We'll be in Micah for five weeks, laying out his message of judgment and forgiveness.
[time=970] They inform each other, they must, they need to.
[time=974] Micah 1 verse 1 says, the word of the Lord that came to Micah.
[time=978] Micah lived in a place called Morrisheth, or Morrisheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria in Jerusalem.
[time=989] Now go to the very end of Micah, Micah chapter seven.
[time=992] I will tell you as you're turning, that Micah's name means who is like Yahweh.
[time=999] Names in the scriptures are extraordinarily meaningful.
[time=1002] You see that around lots of births of very improminent people that names mean something.
[time=1008] Micah's name means something.
[time=1010] Look at verse 18 of Micah seven.
[time=1012] Who is a God like you?
[time=1015] Pardoning iniquity, passing over transgression
[time=1021] for the remnant of his inheritance.
[time=1023] He does not retain his anger forever because he delights instead fast love.
[time=1030] This is the message of Micah.
[time=1032] We just bookended it, didn't we?
[time=1034] Beginning an end of Micah, and everything in between is an explanation of that message that there is nobody like our God.
[time=1040] Who is like him?
[time=1041] It's a rhetorical question.
[time=1042] It needs no answer.
[time=1043] There is no one like our God.
[time=1046] Martin Luther in his own inimitable style said this.
[time=1051] The prophets have a strange way of talking.
[time=1054] Like people who instead of proceeding in an orderly manner ramble off from one thing to the next so that you can't make head or tail of them or see what they're getting at.
[time=1063] So we're gonna pay attention as we go through Micah.
[time=1066] What are you after here Micah?
[time=1068] Quickly, Lewis Castles said this about the nature of what it means to be a prophet quickly.
[time=1075] These quotes will all be offered up to you guys in the digging deeper document that we'll be posting in the middle of the week.
[time=1080] So be looking for that on the church website.
[time=1082] The Hebrew word Navi or Navi translated profit in English Bibles has the connotation, the meaning, the flavor of message bearer.
[time=1091] The prophets were men called by God to serve as his messengers, to a stubborn and distracted people.
[time=1097] They were always careful to point out that they were not voicing their own wisdom.
[time=1103] Their warnings, petitions, and promises were always prefaced by the awesome proclamation.
[time=1109] Thus says the Lord.
[time=1112] There's more to that quote that we'll be posting during the week, but the takeaway is this.
[time=1116] If you were witnessing a conversation between two people and someone said to the other person, what are you, some kind of a prophet?
[time=1123] What would you say that person was meaning with the other person?
[time=1126] What are you a prophet?
[time=1128] What do they mean by that?
[time=1130] That person could do what?
[time=1132] Could tell the future.
[time=1134] Well, less than 1% of what we read in the prophets has yet to be fulfilled in our day.
[time=1141] So what are the prophets?
[time=1144] What's Micah talking about?
[time=1145] Micah is talking about for him the immediate future.
[time=1149] Prophets function, this will be on the screen behind me in front of you.
[time=1153] Prophets are better described as somebody who speaks for God.
[time=1157] God's mouthpiece.
[time=1159] God's spokesman.
[time=1160] They're called to say what God says.
[time=1164] The word of the Lord, Micah 1-1 says, the word of the Lord that came to Micah.
[time=1169] Micah's words are traced back with divine authority to the Father himself.
[time=1175] Prophets, it's better to say this.
[time=1177] Prophets are people in our life who say difficult, truthful things.
[time=1181] That's more like what a prophet is and you have someone like that in your life.
[time=1186] Think of them right now.
[time=1188] Someone who says hard, truthful things.
[time=1190] We are prone to kind of shoe those voices out of our life but we think we do that to our own peril.
[time=1198] Prophets are people who speak truth to power.
[time=1201] They always have been, they always will be.
[time=1204] So when someone speaks prophetically, they're not talking about what will come in the future, it might mean that.
[time=1208] But more nearer, ladies and gentlemen, is somebody who says hard, truthful things.
[time=1214] Prophets got special, heightened perception, vision.
[time=1219] Isaiah was a contemporary of Micah.
[time=1221] He maybe was even known to Micah.
[time=1223] And Micah, Isaiah said he got a vision so he could see things that others could not see, vision that God gave him.
[time=1230] That's a better way of describing prophets.
[time=1233] Very quickly, some questions.
[time=1235] When, where, why?
[time=1237] Let's work this quickly.
[time=1238] If you have your Bibles, again, turn from Micah left to second chronicles.
[time=1243] Second chronicles is after first chronicles.
[time=1247] Second chronicles, 27.
[time=1251] You may have noticed there were three kings listed in the first verse of Micah.
[time=1256] Their names were Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.
[time=1258] We happen to have information about these guys.
[time=1263] Elsewhere in the Old Testament.
[time=1265] Reading from second chronicles, 27.
[time=1267] Second chronicles, 27.
[time=1269] Verse one.
[time=1270] Jotham was 25 years old when he began to reign and he reigns 16 years in Jerusalem.
[time=1276] His mother's name was Jerushah, the daughter of Zaidok.
[time=1279] And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh.
[time=1283] According to all his father, Uzziah had done.
[time=1285] Except, very important word.
[time=1290] Except, he did not enter the temple of the Lord, but the people still followed corrupt practices.
[time=1296] He built the upper gate of the house of the Lord and did much building on the wall of Ophel.
[time=1300] Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah and forts and towers in the wooded hills.
[time=1305] He followed the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them.
[time=1308] And the Ammonites gave him that year 100 talents.
[time=1313] That's almost 8,000 pounds of silver.
[time=1318] Four tons of silver, just from the Ammonites.
[time=1321] 10,000 cores, a core is about six bushels.
[time=1325] So, 60,000 bushels of wheat and 10,000 of barley.
[time=1330] The Ammonites paid him the same amount in the second and third years.
[time=1333] So Jotham became mighty because he ordered his ways before the Lord.
[time=1338] Down to verse two, chapter 28, if you would please.
[time=1342] Jotham's son is named Ahaz.
[time=1344] Ahaz was 20 years old when he began to reign.
[time=1347] He reigns 16 years in Jerusalem.
[time=1350] And he did not do what was right inside of the Lord as his father David had done.
[time=1355] He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel.
[time=1357] He even made metal images for the bales.
[time=1360] He made offerings in the valley of the son of Hanom and burned his sons as an offering.
[time=1367] He made his sons pass through the fire.
[time=1370] My son will be four next world in just about two weeks.
[time=1374] And he sacrificed the made offerings, verse four, on the high places, on the hills and every green tree.
[time=1383] The days of Jotham and Ahaz were times of financial prosperity but spiritual poverty.
[time=1390] And this is the condition into which Micah's word drops.
[time=1397] Micah is an emphatic, no, as to what's going on, especially during the time of Ahaz.
[time=1403] God would not turn to blind eye to this kind of despicable corruption.
[time=1408] Verse one of Micah, if you go back to Micah with me, please.
[time=1413] Verse one of Micah says that he's seen these things concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
[time=1418] Samaria is in the north.
[time=1419] Israel at that time was broken up into two different nations.
[time=1422] Israel in the north, Judah in the south.
[time=1425] Samaria was the capital city of Israel in the north, Jerusalem, the southern kingdom of Judah.
[time=1431] So you can keep that in mind.
[time=1433] Why does Micah write?
[time=1436] Because of what you just read with me from Ahaz.
[time=1439] And from Jotham, from second chronicles, injustice, idolatry and corruption.
[time=1446] Micah announces that these things shall not be left
[time=1454] without an answer from God.
[time=1455] But he also announces, as you've seen with me friends, that God is quick to forgive, to show compassion.
[time=1462] And that God is faithful.
[time=1464] He will keep his promises.
[time=1465] I thought this week, imagining this very moment, I thought about the way that I pray for my kids.
[time=1475] I thought about the fact that I pray that our kids, that my children, Hannah and Christian, will not experience difficulty in hardship.
[time=1484] I am thankful, and you are too, this Thursday is Veterans Day.
[time=1489] And we're thankful for those that serve our country and preserve our freedom and give us the freedom to do this very thing right now.
[time=1496] We are appropriately grateful to those men and women who are serving very bravely, even this very morning.
[time=1501] But I wonder sometimes if we lose our way and we think that we pray for comfort, we pray for safety, we pray for protection only.
[time=1510] And not that if we suffer, that we'll suffer well.
[time=1512] Would you bow your heads and close your eyes?
[time=1516] We'll just pray for a moment together.
[time=1518] Some things to consider.
[time=1519] In light of that, as Kelly comes.
[time=1523] I was thinking friends, Romans eight says that the spirit intercepts our prayers because we don't pray like we should.
[time=1530] He knows our weakness.
[time=1533] He knows that we don't pray as we should.
[time=1537] I would encourage you even now to be mindful, moving forward, that sometimes praying for comfort, sometimes praying for ease leads to a spiritual laziness, which can be very corrupting in our lives.
[time=1554] Father, may we today pray that you will be glorified in our lives, whether that's as Job prayed, whether there's harvest or whether we're in lean times we pray that your name will be praised.
[time=1569] We know that you live and that you will stay on the earth in the last day.
[time=1573] And so Lord, take our prayers, intercept them, make them what they ought to be.
[time=1578] Lead us in the everlasting way.
[time=1580] We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1583] - Amen.
[time=1584] - Micah announces God's judgment on injustice, idolatry and corruption.
[time=1589] This is how the book begins and I wanna just draw your attention if I can to verse two.
[time=1596] See it there with me, here O people, these are the words that God gives Micah to speak and Micah speaks them.
[time=1602] Here O people's, all of you, listen O earth and all it contains.
[time=1609] And let the Lord God be a witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
[time=1615] I want you to look at that phrase there at the beginning.
[time=1617] Here O people's, all of you, listen O earth.
[time=1621] I want you to get a sense for what God's doing here as he begins to speak to the iniquity and the sin of the people.
[time=1628] When I was a freshman in college at San Francisco State University, I played basketball for a guy named Kevin Williams.
[time=1634] Kevin Wilson, sorry.
[time=1635] And Kevin was probably the most intense, most driven, most articulate and motivating and vulgar.
[time=1643] But nonetheless, powerful influence in my life as a young man and as a basketball player.
[time=1650] I couldn't imagine being around somebody that was more into and more driven to teach and correct and inspire.
[time=1659] And a practice with Kevin was something that would just blow your mind.
[time=1663] He never stopped.
[time=1664] He was always talking.
[time=1667] He was always pointing things out.
[time=1669] He wore a baseball cap in practice, basketball, baseball cap in practice.
[time=1674] And when you did something that wasn't right or he wanted to make a point and make it up close to you, he just whipped that thing around backwards so he could get in your face without the bill of the cap hitting you in the head.
[time=1684] It was an amazing experience.
[time=1685] And as we would do drills in practice, some would be doing ball handling, some would be doing shooting, some would be doing defensive slides, some would be doing other things.
[time=1693] Kevin would just walk around practice watching and looking.
[time=1696] And if you heard him say, which you would hear him say this often, as you walked around and saw you doing what you were doing, if you heard him say, not even close, you knew it wasn't good.
[time=1709] Because following not even close, which meant he just watched you do what you did and you weren't even close to doing it right.
[time=1716] Something wrong had happened and correction was needed.
[time=1724] Following not even close, he'd say, everybody here.
[time=1727] And I'm telling you, it was amazing.
[time=1728] Ballboys, waterboys, managers, assistant coaches, the entire team, office staff, if they were anywhere near his voice.
[time=1736] When he said everybody here, it was just like, whoa, everybody ran as fast as they could to that place in the gym where he was, where he was with you.
[time=1745] And he would then write there in front of everybody, correct you.
[time=1749] And in the process, he would let everybody know that something wrong had happened, that correction was needed.
[time=1759] And sometimes it was really painful.
[time=1765] Here old peoples, God says, everybody here, he gathers them up, he rounds up the troops
[time=1777] and God is in essence saying, gather round, correction is needed.
[time=1780] And let the Lord God be a witness against you,
[time=1786] terrifying words.
[time=1789] Sorry, I'll speak for myself.
[time=1792] That would be terrifying.
[time=1795] Let the Lord God be a witness against you.
[time=1799] This is not going to be pretty, he and essence says,
[time=1805] but all of you need to see and understand that as the one true God I have the authority to and must judge and discipline.
[time=1814] His holiness cannot be, will not be compromised.
[time=1818] And so he takes Israel to court.
[time=1822] At the end of verse two, we see the legal terminology inserted into the text, you see it there?
[time=1831] And let the Lord God be a what?
[time=1834] A witness against you, the Lord.
[time=1837] A witness against you from his holy temple.
[time=1840] He is going to in the coming verses, lay out his case, if you will, against his people.
[time=1845] And the verdict, Micah describes the verdict is not good.
[time=1851] The verdict is very, very bad.
[time=1853] Sin is a big deal and God's character cannot
[time=1859] and will not be compromised.
[time=1862] So what will God's judgment look like?
[time=1866] What will God's rightful, righteous judgment against iniquity look like?
[time=1873] What's going to happen?
[time=1874] Look at verse three, four in the beginning of five, for behold, it says, the Lord is coming forth from that holy temple described in verse two.
[time=1885] For behold, the Lord is coming forth from his place.
[time=1889] And as he comes forth from his place, he will come down and tread on the high places of the earth.
[time=1896] The mountains will melt under him.
[time=1898] Imagine this, Micah, great with words.
[time=1901] Steve will talk more in a little while about the word smithing that Micah does.
[time=1906] Here he paints a picture for you and I to just imagine what the judgment of God and the terror of God in his judgment, the power of God in his judgment can look like.
[time=1918] The mountains will melt under him and the valleys will be split like wax before the fire like water poured down a steep place.
[time=1930] Why?
[time=1934] All this for the what, for the rebellion of Jacob and for the sins of the house of Israel.
[time=1944] I wanna take you back to verse three where it says, for behold, the Lord is coming forth.
[time=1950] You can underline that, circle that.
[time=1953] In the Hebrew there, the phrase coming forth or in your translation, it may say coming out, signifies in the Hebrew one, marching out fully prepared for battle.
[time=1964] The picture that gets painted here, as God speaks through Micah to the people, is of a God coming out not to shake hands this time.
[time=1973] No, we have a picture here of a God who comes out armor ready.
[time=1977] He comes out ready to engage in the fight, ready for battle and when you realize what he's coming to battle against, when you realize what's on the heart of God in this case, as he rightfully and righteously deals with sin, it begins to make sense.
[time=1995] I wanna point out a phrase here for you, for behold, the Lord is coming forth from his place.
[time=2002] He will come down and tread on the, what, say it, high places of the earth, the high places.
[time=2013] If you've ever read, I'm curious, if you've ever read in the Old Testament, and as you've been reading through the Old Testament, if in your reading as you hear about and kind of take in some of the wandering and some of the sinfulness and some of the unfaithfulness of the people of Israel, have you ever read about these high places that seem to be associated with their rebellion and iniquity?
[time=2040] Raise your hand if you've ever heard that or read that.
[time=2043] All right, some of you, not all of you.
[time=2045] Very important, I think, today.
[time=2048] As graphic as it is, I think, important for you to at least have an understanding of what it is God's dealing with as he here in Micah deals with the high places.
[time=2062] You can write this down.
[time=2063] We see high places being described and defined for us in Leviticus 26.
[time=2072] You find it in Numbers 33.
[time=2076] You see high places in 1 Samuel 9.
[time=2079] We come across instances of high places being built in 1 Chronicles 16.
[time=2086] Here's the deal.
[time=2089] High places were literal, many temples that the people would build.
[time=2096] And they would build these little mini temples that you would actually kind of go into.
[time=2101] They would build them high.
[time=2104] They would build them up on structures.
[time=2107] They would build them on hills.
[time=2110] They would find any high place in the city or they would just create one by building the scaffolding, if you will, to support it.
[time=2122] And in these high places that were open, usually a covering, but nonetheless open, visually you could see it.
[time=2132] And in these high places is where Ashera poles were put up and prostitutes would dance
[time=2141] and babies would get sacrificed and acts of immorality would take place.
[time=2149] All in the name of worship and all having to do with foreign gods.
[time=2160] And they would build these places on high intentionally so that what took place in them could be seen and heard.
[time=2171] Ezekiel paints a graphic picture.
[time=2177] Ezekiel, Steve and I were talking earlier.
[time=2181] In Ezekiel, Ezekiel speaking to those who were in captivity, reminding them of their sin when it came about after all your wickedness, woe, Ezekiel says, woe to you, declares the Lord God that you built yourself a shrine and made yourself a high place in every square.
[time=2202] You built yourself a high place at the top of every street and made your beauty abominable and you spread your legs to every passerby to multiply your harlotry.
[time=2218] I think the reminder church for you and I this morning on this front is that sin left unchecked
[time=2231] becomes bold and arrogant.
[time=2236] I hope you'll write that down.
[time=2241] Sin left unchecked, a heart that's hardened and just continues in its hardened state just gets more and more brazen, more and more uncaring and unfeeling and arrogant in its iniquity.
[time=2259] And you may not be and I may not be building high places but I know most of you in the room if we were just to speak honestly about this, you know it's true, I know it's true.
[time=2273] As the heart stays hard, the sin becomes, can become more and more bold, more and more out there.
[time=2282] And God comes from his high place to tread on and run over and destroy the high places
[time=2293] in their lives and ours.
[time=2295] Why, why is all this intense, thorough, extensive, painful judgment going to occur?
[time=2302] Why are mountains going to melt and valleys going to split?
[time=2305] Well, because of sin, you see it right there in 5a.
[time=2308] All this for the rebellion of Jacob and for the sins of the house of Israel.
[time=2312] Sin must be judged.
[time=2313] In verse six, follow with me for I will make Samaria, what does he say?
[time=2317] A heap of ruins in the open country, planting places for a vineyard.
[time=2322] I will pour her stones down into the valley, watch this and will lay bare her foundations, fascinating.
[time=2331] He says, I will lay bare her foundations.
[time=2334] What's this about?
[time=2335] What do you think that's referring to?
[time=2339] I'll tell you quickly what it's referring to.
[time=2340] It speaks to the public shame that comes when people see at a foundational level the cracks and flaws which led to destruction.
[time=2350] I will lay bare her foundations which were not good.
[time=2355] Israel implodes like a poorly built building.
[time=2361] A heap, what did the text say?
[time=2362] A heap of ruins.
[time=2364] And when it's all said and done, God reveals the weakness.
[time=2368] He lays bare the foundation for all to see.
[time=2371] Question for you this morning before Steve comes back.
[time=2374] Important question for you.
[time=2376] How is your foundation that part of you?
[time=2381] We've been talking about beginning in recent weeks on our spiritual continuum, the beginning stages of your faith journey and how important it is that we help you lay strong foundations that will stand.
[time=2396] How are your foundational disciplines these days?
[time=2399] Your times with him, your readiness to serve, your love and devotion to the scriptures, your willingness and readiness to confess sin, the relational harmony that you're helping to promote with each other and with him.
[time=2415] Are you being built to implode or are you pursuing foundational strength?
[time=2423] Real quick, let me just say this.
[time=2427] Guess what the most critical foundational principle is
[time=2433] in the life of a child of God?
[time=2435] This is a long discussion.
[time=2436] I'm gonna summarize it real quickly.
[time=2437] Guess what the most foundational principle is in the life of a child of God, a principle that must be in place for your foundation to remain strong.
[time=2450] Here it is, do you really love and desire God more than anything or anyone else?
[time=2459] I'm gonna ask you that again.
[time=2460] Think about it, my friends, this morning.
[time=2462] Do you really, I mean really, love and desire God more than anything or anyone else.
[time=2476] That which you spend time towards, that which you have affection for, that which keeps you up late and gets you up early.
[time=2486] Do you really love God more than anything or anyone else?
[time=2491] This had gone terribly wrong for Israel.
[time=2493] How do we know, look at verse seven and eight.
[time=2496] All of her idols, there it is.
[time=2498] All of her idols will be smashed.
[time=2500] All of her earnings will be burned with fire and all of her images, I will make desolate.
[time=2506] Israel had fallen into idolatry.
[time=2509] For she collected them from a harlot's earnings and to the earnings of a harlot, they will return.
[time=2517] As Steve comes, I wanna ask you to bow your heads if you would and close your eyes.
[time=2521] Father in heaven, I love these friends of mine.
[time=2526] God, I love this family that we have.
[time=2529] I love the things that you're doing in our lives.
[time=2531] And God, I know that there are temptations every day that my friends face.
[time=2537] I know there are whisperings and there are yells from the enemy to pursue that which doesn't satisfy, to, as Steve mentioned, drink from fountains that are empty, to run toward things that promise life but only ruin.
[time=2554] And oh, God, I pray as we look at these truths today and as we continue to look at God's dealing with these people, that we would be reminded of the great life and hope and peace found when our affections and our love and our attention is based and grounded solely in you.
[time=2572] Father, keep our hearts sensitive to what will happen
[time=2578] if we don't.
[time=2579] In your son's name, we pray.
[time=2581] Amen. - Amen.
[time=2582] Did you see how those verses described sin?
[time=2588] I think we sometimes look at sin as a whoopsy or a mistake, mean mistake and the Bible doesn't describe sin that way.
[time=2597] The Bible describes sin as a transgression.
[time=2600] A transgression is there's the line and we go right across it.
[time=2606] It describes sin as iniquity.
[time=2608] Iniquity is a blot, iniquity is a stain.
[time=2612] And so the scripture is defined sin as God defines it in Micah as a blatant disregard for what God says.
[time=2621] And let's be honest, when we sin friends, we're not just whoopsie, mistake or my bad.
[time=2628] That kind of attitude towards sin is not God's attitude.
[time=2631] He never minimizes its effects.
[time=2632] Micah certainly doesn't either.
[time=2635] A couple of summers ago, we were working through the beatitudes with great delight.
[time=2641] One of those beatitudes says, "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted." The only appropriate response to what we've only read in one through seven is verse eight.
[time=2654] Take a look at Micah one and verse eight with me.
[time=2656] "For this I will lament and wail," says Micah.
[time=2662] "I will go stripped and naked.
[time=2666] "I will make lamentation like the jackals "and mourning like the ostriches."
[time=2675] When we in the West, when we mourn, we go behind closed doors, we're private, we withdraw ourselves from community appropriately to tell our friends and those around us that this is time for us to be alone, to be with those that we love, to rally around each other.
[time=2693] In the East, mourning was a very private, was a very public, excuse me, affair.
[time=2698] In Mark chapter five, when Jairus' little daughter dies, they hire mourners to come to the house and make loud noises, loud crying, a commotion, it's called there.
[time=2710] You see that also in the prophet Micah here.
[time=2714] Micah is making a public statement about the sin of his people.
[time=2718] Stripping to his naked, to his bare feet, perhaps more than that.
[time=2725] In these verses, moving on from verses nine through 16, Micah is describing a route, a route that a person named Sennacherib will take.
[time=2737] There's good news and there's bad news in Micah.
[time=2740] The bad news is that the message didn't take, remember, for Israel in the North.
[time=2745] They did not listen to Micah's words and they were judged by God when they fell to the Assyrians in 722 BC.
[time=2753] The Assyrians were very arrogant people.
[time=2755] They love to tell you about these things.
[time=2756] They love to say things like in this year of this king, we destroyed these people and so we have record of it.
[time=2763] In 722, the kingdom of Israel in the North fell to the Assyrians.
[time=2766] In 701, this guy Sennacherib is marching south and they fall like dominoes, all these villages.
[time=2773] Take a look at verses 10 through 16 of Micah 1.
[time=2776] Lots of places are listed there.
[time=2780] Would you stand with me?
[time=2781] We're gonna read these verses together, verses 10 through 16.
[time=2784] If we could guys have that map on the screen behind me, as I read these verses with you, check out on the map behind me in front of you.
[time=2794] You'll see these places show up.
[time=2796] There are maps in your Bible for a reason.
[time=2798] This isn't Narnia, this is a real place.
[time=2803] And so the force of its message ought to sing out to us because you can set your feet in the dirt where these places are mentioned.
[time=2811] We can find them on a map.
[time=2813] Let's read verses 10 through 16.
[time=2814] Kelly mentioned the wordsmithing of Micah.
[time=2816] It's on full display here, I'll explain.
[time=2819] Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all.
[time=2822] In Beit le Afra, roll yourselves in the dust.
[time=2826] Pass on your way inhabitants of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame.
[time=2831] The inhabitants of Z'an'an do not come out.
[time=2835] The lamentation of Beit at Z'el shall take away from you at standing place.
[time=2839] For the inhabitants of Morote wait anxiously for good because disaster has come down from the Lord to the gate of Jerusalem.
[time=2848] Harness the steeds, the chariots, inhabitants of Lakeish.
[time=2852] It was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Z'an.
[time=2855] For in you were found the transgressions.
[time=2859] You see that, of Israel.
[time=2861] Therefore you shall give parting gifts to Morashate Gath.
[time=2865] The houses of Aqzib shall be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel.
[time=2869] I will again bring a conqueror to you, inhabitants of Morashah.
[time=2873] The glory of Israel shall come to Adalim.
[time=2876] Make yourselves bald and cut off your hair.
[time=2880] For the children of your delight, make yourselves as bald as the eagle, for they shall go from you into exile.
[time=2887] You may be seated.
[time=2888] Those 12 places listed in those verses are on the route Sonakarib actually took.
[time=2896] And Micah says it's coming.
[time=2898] Praise be to God that we have record of in the prophet Isaiah and elsewhere in chronicles that has Aqiah heeds Micah's words, we think.
[time=2907] Repents, and the nation goes through a revival and Assyria is stopped cold on the Alsace of Jerusalem.
[time=2916] We were told that God sends a wasting sickness and destroys huge portions of their army overnight.
[time=2924] And it goes back the way he came to Assyria.
[time=2928] God fending for his people as they turn from their wicked ways.
[time=2933] Look at verse 10 with me, if you would.
[time=2935] Beit le effra literally translated means house of dust.
[time=2940] So you see Micah says, hey, dusty town, rolling dust.
[time=2944] Verse 11, pass on your way inhabitants of Shafir.
[time=2949] Shafir sounds like the Hebrew word for beautiful.
[time=2951] So those that are beautiful will be naked and ashamed.
[time=2955] So again, the word play.
[time=2956] Z'an'an sounds like the Hebrew word for come out.
[time=2960] So coming out town, come on out.
[time=2962] Nobody will come to help you.
[time=2965] Verse 12, morote, the inhabitants of morote.
[time=2968] Morote sounds like the word for bitter.
[time=2970] They're waiting for good things, but instead bitter town gets bitter things.
[time=2975] Verse 13, steeds harness the steeds, the horses to the chariots, inhabitants of Laquiche.
[time=2982] The Hebrew word for steeds, for horses is lara-cage.
[time=2986] So horsey town, no horses for you.
[time=2988] Laquiche was a fortified city known for its chariots.
[time=2992] The breeder's cup was on television yesterday.
[time=2995] So we got these beautiful, fast, award-winning horses on display.
[time=3000] And God says, look for your horses.
[time=3001] You won't find them, horsey town.
[time=3003] Laquiche, lara-cage, no horses to come to your aid.
[time=3009] Verse 13 continues, the daughter of Zion, and you were found the transgressions of Israel.
[time=3014] Verse 14, morachate, gath.
[time=3017] Morachate, gath is a phrase that means parting gifts or a dowry.
[time=3023] It's time to say goodbye.
[time=3025] Send farewell gifts, the new living translation says.
[time=3028] Aqzib, verse 14, aqzib, the Hebrew word for deceitful is aqzab.
[time=3035] Deceitful town gets deceived.
[time=3036] The liar is lied to.
[time=3038] Lying town is deceived.
[time=3040] That's the picture.
[time=3041] Verse 15, morachate, sounds like conqueror.
[time=3044] The conqueror shall be conquered.
[time=3045] You see a pattern here?
[time=3047] The Bible is literature, friends, but not just literature.
[time=3051] There's poetry in the Bible, but it's not only poetry.
[time=3055] Don't be afraid of that.
[time=3056] It's a story, but not just a story.
[time=3059] It's a true story.
[time=3061] So don't be afraid of those things.
[time=3062] It's true that God uses literary devices through a guy named Micah, who I think was a good writer, his Holy Spirit super-intends that entire process.
[time=3072] And thankfully, it's actually fun to read when you get your mind around it, and we'll help you with that.
[time=3076] Adolom and verse 15 is the place that David fled from Saul in 2nd Samuel 23, so they're gonna go the same way.
[time=3083] And verse 16, make yourselves bald and cut off your hair.
[time=3088] It's clear to us from the Old Testament that all that was required for mourning was to mess up your hair.
[time=3093] If somebody walks into your office tomorrow and they have bags into their eyes and they have kind of swollen cheeks and their hair is all disheveled.
[time=3101] Did you have a bad weekend?
[time=3103] You'd ask that question, 'cause it would be obvious that they are, something is terribly wrong.
[time=3107] And so it would be appropriate in the Old Testament for someone to have disheveled hair if they were mourning.
[time=3113] Well, Micah goes further, and it's gone.
[time=3116] So it's that bad.
[time=3119] The sin that Kelly has described going on in Israel requires Micah to go the next step.
[time=3126] And it's really sad here, friends, because in verse 16, make yourselves bald for the children of your delight.
[time=3132] The Hebrew there is something like the sons of your pamperings.
[time=3137] Your pampered kids are gonna get carted away tied up with ropes if you don't repent.
[time=3146] So this is a very strong message for very serious times.
[time=3150] Serious times require a serious message and a serious response.
[time=3155] And so there are all manner, all manner of appropriate responses for you and I, friends.
[time=3162] The following, let's read this paraphrase.
[time=3164] A guy named Moffat, I couldn't find this man's first name.
[time=3166] Everybody quotes this because he's, what he's done is he paraphrased these verses from Micah 1, I think in a very helpful way.
[time=3174] So this is what Micah is saying.
[time=3176] If we could read Hebrew together, like we could read English, it would look something like this.
[time=3182] Tell it not in Tellington, whale not in whaling.
[time=3187] Dust Manor will eat dirt, dressy town, flea naked.
[time=3192] Safe fold will not save.
[time=3194] Wall Chester's walls are down.
[time=3197] A bitter dose drinks bitterton towards Jerusalem.
[time=3202] City of peace, the Lord sends war.
[time=3205] Harness the war steeds, oh men of Barsted.
[time=3209] Zion's beginning of sinning equal to Israel's crimes.
[time=3213] To welfare, a last farewell.
[time=3216] For trapping trapped Israel's kings.
[time=3221] As Kelly comes up and we wrap this up together, friends, I would simply say this to you, as I mentioned a few moments ago, serious times demand a serious response.
[time=3233] And I suspect that for each one of us, there are serious things underway in your life that demand a serious response.
[time=3241] And Micah lays out for us how God feels about our trespasses and our sins.
[time=3248] And he's not describing them as a whopsy or as an I just made a mistake.
[time=3254] Don't minimize the effects of sin.
[time=3256] Don't disrespect yourself or those around you in your life who are deeply struggling with their sin by making it like it's not a big deal.
[time=3263] Christ died for our sins.
[time=3267] And in that respect, we cannot make light of it.
[time=3272] And there's a real sense in which that Micah is pointing toward all these sufferings, these trials and travails have all been heaped upon the Son of God.
[time=3283] And if God's fully, His wrath is fully satisfied.
[time=3286] Now praise be to God, His work is finished.
[time=3289] But Micah is a pre-figurement of that in some ways, almost 700 years before Christ is born.
[time=3296] Hey, would you stand quietly?
[time=3297] I don't want you to leave, but would you just stand as we prepare to go?
[time=3300] Stephen, I want to just give you one thing this morning to take home three on the list.
[time=3305] You may see them, but I want to just have us speak to this first one briefly.
[time=3309] I know people who read this.
[time=3310] I know folks who sit in a room like this and think, wow, God got after it in the Old Testament and this talk of judgment and the way He responds rightfully to iniquity.
[time=3319] And there are folks who think, man, I'm glad I'm alive now in the New Testament age.
[time=3323] 'Cause whenever you talk about judgment, Kelly, I'm just glad all that fell on who?
[time=3328] Christ, which it did, amen?
[time=3332] - Amen.
[time=3333] - But we want to just remind you as you go to today, redemption does not preclude what?
[time=3338] God's discipline.
[time=3340] Be grateful for your redemption, amen?
[time=3343] Redemption does not preclude.
[time=3345] It does not allow some, we're still held accountable.
[time=3349] Steve, just share with him briefly about Hebrews 12.
[time=3352] I thought that was great what you said this morning and then we'll go.
[time=3354] I know this verse, friends, the Lord disciplines Hebrews 12s, Hebrews 12, those He loves.
[time=3362] If we love our kids, we'll discipline them.
[time=3364] We think it's the opposite.
[time=3365] If they do this, if they do this, they won't love me.
[time=3368] They want you to discipline them.
[time=3370] And it's hard, no one likes to be disciplined, but for a season, it's for a harvest of righteousness down the road.
[time=3376] Down the road, it will lead to good things in our kids, good things for us.
[time=3380] If we don't forsake our God-given roles and God as a father, praise be that He's our father, knows how to give good gifts to His kids and that sometimes involves correction, discipline, endure it as sons knowing that He loves you.
[time=3395] - Amen. - Amen.
[time=3396] - I wanna just invite you as we close.
[time=3398] If there's anybody in the room this morning, and I mean this, you know we do, you're engaged in something you know you shouldn't be in.
[time=3405] Maybe it's not brazen and bold in public yet, but it's just something that you know saddens and breaks the heart of God, and you want to move in a different direction.
[time=3416] As Steve closes us this morning, if you wanna make your way down, we would love to pray with you.
[time=3420] We'd love to encourage you.
[time=3421] We'd love to help you along the way.
[time=3424] We're thankful that you're here, and I wanna do everything we can to support you.
[time=3428] So Steve, close us if you would, and we'll go.
[time=3431] - Please pray with me, friends.
[time=3432] Dear father, mountains melt before you like wax.
[time=3442] You are awesome in power, and we can trust you with our problems.
[time=3451] Lord, that means that nothing is too difficult for you.
[time=3454] That means that there is no thing that we will face that is too much for you to overcome.
[time=3462] And so may we trust you, father, in our prayers.
[time=3466] May we trust you in our decisions that we make day by day as parents, as workers, as friends.
[time=3471] As sons, as daughters, as spouses.
[time=3474] May we trust you with the day to day struggles in our lives, knowing that you are that kind of a God, that there is no one like you.
[time=3483] Forgiving sin, but just.
[time=3488] May we trust you, almighty.
[time=3490] (upbeat music)
