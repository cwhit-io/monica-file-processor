[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] [MUSIC - 222 seconds]
[time=255] you, but now my eyes have seen, oh, you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy. You're worthy to be
[time=272] praised forever and a day, you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy. You're worthy to be
[time=298] praised forever and a day, you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy to be praised forever and a day,
[time=315] you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy. You're worthy to be praised forever and a day,
[time=334] you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy. You're worthy to be
[time=344] praised forever and a day. Amen. Well, hello again everybody. Welcome back to the Bible Hour. If you're a
[time=357] part of our family and part of our viewing audience that tunes in on a regular basis, it's great to
[time=363] have you back with us. If you're watching today for the first time, I want to say a special welcome to you. My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege and have had the privilege for the last 11 years
[time=374] to serve as the senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and we love the chance God gives us week after week to bring the truth of his word. It's a truth that can change your life. We get the
[time=386] privilege of bringing it to thousands and thousands of people in this region and we're thankful you've
[time=392] tuned in today. Two things I want to say to you this morning that I hope you'll think about. Number one, you've heard me say before and that is that on our website at blackhawkministries.org,
[time=403] you can go on our homepage and find the icon down the page a bit called Digging Deeper. The Digging
[time=410] Deeper icon is something you don't want to miss. This gives you a chance to do the one thing that way too many people don't do enough of during the week and that is continue to think about,
[time=422] continue to pray about, continue to study and be mindful of the message that you heard on Sunday.
[time=428] You and I both know that by Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday, sometimes the truth that you hear on
[time=435] Sunday begins to kind of fade. It begins to lose its luster if you will and that's not the truth
[time=441] losing its luster. It's you and I growing distant from that truth and so Digging Deeper gives you a
[time=447] chance to download a document that allows you to continue on right where we leave off on Sunday.
[time=454] It is a great great opportunity for you to find application and encouragement and inspiration
[time=461] from the message on Sunday all the way through the week. So go to our website and check out Digging Deeper. The other thing I want to say is this and I've said this before as well. I hope that if you
[time=472] watch the broadcast on a somewhat regular basis and I hope if you don't have a church home,
[time=479] I can't tell you how many people I meet. I mean month after month after month all these years I keep meeting people here on a Sunday morning who say we finally just decided to come and I hope if
[time=491] that's you this morning that the Spirit of God is prompting you and moving you in that direction, we hope I hope you'll come. We would love nothing more than to meet you, put our arms around you,
[time=502] walk through life together. We love the fact that we can connect on the broadcast but would love nothing more than to have the chance to connect with you in person. So come Sunday mornings at 9
[time=512] and 1045 we would love to have you here. I hope this morning's message will encourage you. I hope
[time=518] it will remind you of our God and His character and the kind of life that He requires from us.
[time=524] We love you and we're thankful for this time together. God bless you. Have a great week and as
[time=530] always we hope to see you soon.
[time=548] [MUSIC - 274 seconds]
[time=826] Hey, I was thinking this week. Aren't you glad and you can respond out loud if you feel led. Aren't you glad that God does the things that God does for you on a daily basis in your life in relationship with Him? Amen?
[time=842] [APPLAUSE]
[time=844] I was thinking about it and I want you to think about it with me. I want you to think about that just for a moment here as we start. What are you thankful for? What does God do for you on a in you?
[time=858] How does God minister to you on a daily regular basis? Just think with me for a moment about the ways in which He accomplishes that in your life.
[time=871] I was struck this week by His provision, how He provides for me, how resources get stretched, how comfort comes in a time of need, how encouraging words come along, just the right moment.
[time=895] Anybody identify with that? I'm just amazed at how God provides for me.
[time=903] I continued to think about it and I thought about it. I just wrote a few things down. I'm just so amazed and so grateful how He continues to teach me. Does He teach you? He keeps teaching me things.
[time=915] He keeps growing me. We've been talking about growing or dying. I'm thankful that currently I'm not dying. I'm growing. He keeps growing me. He grows me through the Word of God. He grows me through the Spirit of God. He grows me through involvement with the people of God. You?
[time=933] I'm so thankful that He teaches me still. I've told you this for years. It's one of the things I love about being in ministry. It's one of the things I love about my job.
[time=945] I know it's one of the things you love about being part of the body of Christ. He allows us to see transformed and changed lives, doesn't He?
[time=955] He does that all the time. He lets us see people who come into this place. They come into your life. They come into my life. We get the privilege of coming alongside in the midst of their trial, their crisis, their difficulty, their young, their old families crumbling, circumstantially challenged, whatever it might be.
[time=975] He believers struggling with their faith. People far from God wondering if there is such thing as faith and we get to see God do that miraculous thing that only God can do as He transforms and changes people's lives right before our eyes. Amen?
[time=994] It's amazing what God does. Here's one though that I wrote down today. I know I don't stand alone in saying this. I know it's something that we probably have all experienced.
[time=1008] And it brings us back to Micah, the prophet, and our study of this book this morning. Aren't you glad that God at times, while He provides and teaches and transforms, aren't you glad at times that God warns you?
[time=1031] Aren't you thankful that at times God loves you enough to wave a really bright yellow or red flag in your life? Aren't you thankful that the Spirit of God at times and the Word of God at times and the people of God at times come alongside you and me
[time=1050] and deliver to you and me at times a very straightforward, very unambiguous? You better slow down.
[time=1062] Aren't you thankful for God's warning? Last week we jumped into our study of the book of Micah. The prophet, we were reminded that prophets like Micah and His contemporary Isaiah spoke the Word of the Lord.
[time=1075] They spoke the very words of God to both God's leaders and God's people. This is what prophets did. And they were oftentimes words of, look at the screen, they were oftentimes words of correction.
[time=1089] These words from the Lord that prophets spoke and wrote were oftentimes words of confrontation. They were words of warning. They were oftentimes words of coming judgment.
[time=1102] And what was it that had been on God's heart? What was it that He wanted so desperately for His people? We read about it.
[time=1110] Stephen, I gave it to you as kind of a foundational verse for our study last week. I think I'll probably just read this every week we're in Micah.
[time=1119] As we begin our time, what is it that God had wanted for His people? What is it that from the beginning He had declared would be good for them to abide by?
[time=1130] Look with me at Micah 6, 6 to 8. This is what God had wanted for the Israelites. This is what He had wanted for the family of God.
[time=1139] This is what shall I come to the Lord and bow myself before the God on high? Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings, with yearling calves?
[time=1146] Does the Lord take delight in thousands of rams, in ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I present my firstborn for my rebellious acts, the fruit of my body, for the sin of my soul?
[time=1159] In other words, how does God want me to come before Him? How is it that God wants me to function? What is it that will be pleasing to God as I live out my faith and worship Him?
[time=1173] God gives Micah the exact words right here in verse 8, "He has told you." This isn't new news. "He has told you, oh man, what is good, and what does the Lord require of you but to do what?"
[time=1193] When I say it, everybody's supposed to say it back. But to do what? To love what? And to walk how? To do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.
[time=1208] This is what God had wanted. This is what He had called His people to.
[time=1216] And the warning, the reminder for you and me this morning as we come back to our study of Micah, I had them put it on the screen. I just want you to write this word down.
[time=1224] And I want you, I've been praying all week that you would do this this morning, my friends, that you would listen today.
[time=1232] That you would listen to the Spirit of God. That you would listen to the very words of God as He speaks them, as He imparts them into your life and into your heart and soul.
[time=1245] And mine. Take to heart, my friends, these words of warning. Some will say to me, "Yeah, but it's a different day. Kelly, you're in Micah. It's the Old Testament. It's different people.
[time=1256] It's a different day." And I know they were somewhat different people, and I know it was a different day, but listen.
[time=1264] Listen, same sin. The exact same iniquity befels them that corrupts you and die.
[time=1279] Different people, different day, maybe. Same sin. We really haven't changed a bit.
[time=1286] Last week in Micah 1, we saw God through Micah addressing the sin of the Jews, specifically their sin against who? God.
[time=1296] They're sin against God, specifically their idolatry. We saw them in verse 3 of Micah 1 building their high places.
[time=1304] We saw them building these constructs of immorality and illicit worship.
[time=1309] We saw them building these places up on high, where all of their sin and immoral, audacious iniquity could be seen and heard through all the land.
[time=1319] These high places that God says He will judge. We saw their idolatry through their high places, through their idols, through their immoral earnings and false images.
[time=1330] As we looked at their idolatry, we were challenged again to think real honestly and personally about that, which we might struggle with on this front.
[time=1345] It got you and me thinking about what or who we have more affection for than God.
[time=1354] It got you and me thinking about what we give more time to, who we give more time to, what we give more time to.
[time=1364] You see, this is idolatry when our affections go towards someone or something other than him, when our time is given more to someone or something other than him, when we have a greater desire for place greater priority on someone or something other than him.
[time=1383] We saw this address in Michael 1, their sin against God, their idolatry and now as we come to chapter 2, Mike it delivers God's word as he addresses and confronts there.
[time=1394] I hope you'll write this down, their sin against their fellow man.
[time=1399] There were sins against God and there were sins against man.
[time=1410] Reminds me of the disciples asking Jesus, remember they said Jesus, what's the greatest command of all?
[time=1417] They asked what was the greatest command he gave him to?
[time=1421] He said the greatest command of all is that you would love who?
[time=1425] God, and the second greatest command is that you would love who?
[time=1429] Each other.
[time=1431] Jesus in the New Testament and yet we see here in the Old Testament prophet Micah, we see where Jesus got it.
[time=1439] We see where this emanates from, it emanates from the very heart of God.
[time=1444] God's always been about loving him and God has always placed an enormous priority on loving and caring for others.
[time=1455] Their sin against their fellow man.
[time=1458] Would you stand in honor of God's word and allow me to read this to you this morning, Mike it chapter 2 verses 1 to 3.
[time=1466] Micah begins in verse 1 of chapter 2, he says, "Woe, woe to those who scheme iniquity, who work out evil on their beds.
[time=1477] When morning comes they do it, for it is in the power of their hands to do so.
[time=1483] They covet verse 2, they covet fields and then seize them and houses and take them away.
[time=1490] They rob a man and his house, a man and his inheritance.
[time=1495] Therefore thus says the Lord, "Behold, I am planning against this family, his family, the nation of Israel."
[time=1504] God says, "Tell them I am planning against this family a calamity, a calamity from which you cannot remove your necks.
[time=1516] And you will not walk hodily, for it will be an evil time."
[time=1525] Our Father in heaven we would pray simply this morning as we stand here expectantly in your presence that we would listen this morning.
[time=1535] Oh God that these people, this family who I love would listen not to me but to the very words that you would have for them today.
[time=1545] God words that you have prepared, God words that are right, words that are true, words that speak to the very realities of their lives.
[time=1555] God as we listen to you today, I pray God that we would be changed, I pray God that we would listen with hearts that are open and soft and moldable.
[time=1565] God I pray that we would resist pride and arrogance.
[time=1570] God I pray that we wouldn't be fearful, that we would sense the privilege of standing in the presence of a God who loves us deeply.
[time=1580] Thankful for this time, God we give it to you in your son's name we pray. Amen. You can be seated.
[time=1587] Micah chapter two verses one to five, let me just give you a quick overview of where we'll be today and Micah chapter two verses one to five.
[time=1595] We'll see Micah speaking out against the corrupt practices of the affluent.
[time=1600] We'll go on in verses six through eleven and see where he speaks out against those voices who had tried to silence the voice of the Prophet.
[time=1609] God through Micah speaks against the corrupt practices of the affluent and God through Micah speaks against those who tried to silence him.
[time=1618] We'll get to six and eleven, let's start with verses one to five and one to five Micah speaks against the affluent.
[time=1625] Now before you check out because I just use the word affluent and you're thinking I don't make a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year so I get a pass on this part of the message.
[time=1637] Hold on, let me read this to you, the affluent, the affluent, those who have more than others.
[time=1650] Raise your hand if that's true of you, you have more than someone else.
[time=1658] Okay, thank you, you affluent group you, nobody gets out of this one, right?
[time=1667] We're rich today if you got change in the ashtray of your car, if your car still has an ashtray, I don't know if cars still have ashtrays, but it's just how someone said it to me recently.
[time=1677] You're rich today, if you got change on your dresser, got a little cup up there with a bunch of quarters and dimes and nickels, you're rich.
[time=1685] You're affluent, my friends, if you have more than someone else, the affluent, those who have more than others, those who by virtue of position, possession or power, watch this have the capacity to help or hurt others.
[time=1702] If you find yourself in that position today, where you, by virtue of what you have, who you are, where you work, where you live, just who you are in your life, if you have the opportunity to help or hurt others, if you get to make that choice, you've got more than someone else.
[time=1721] God speaks to you this morning as He spoke to those in the family of God, and at first, as He speaks, it's not so good.
[time=1734] God is justifiably, because He does justice, right? He loves kindness, but He does justice, and He is justifiably, as it relates to sins against our fellow man, He is ticked off.
[time=1751] Big time. Look, verse 1, chapter 2, whoa, whoa to those who scheme iniquity, who work out evil on their beds.
[time=1766] When morning comes, they do it for it is in the power of their hands, they covet fields and then seize them and houses and take them away, they rob a man in his house, a man and his inheritance.
[time=1780] Micah starts out his word from the Lord to his people with the phrase whoa, it is an angry pronouncement in the Hebrew, an angry pronouncement of judgment, guilt, shame, even death, it can most clearly be translated, be damned.
[time=1799] This is how God feels. This is God's heart. This is God's passion. This is how He responds to those who sin against their fellow man.
[time=1810] He, in essence, says shame on you, literally, whoa. Those of you, as you read through those first couple of verses, those of you who, in essence, lie awake at night and plan to take away from others.
[time=1829] Don't let these next few minutes here. Don't let me just stand here and talk at you.
[time=1838] Don't let this be Old Testament thousands of years ago, stuff, my friends.
[time=1845] What did I ask you to do this morning? Listen, those of you who lay awake at night and plan in any way, shape or form, to take away from others.
[time=1861] You have the knowledge and position to do so, and you do it. You take more than you should on any front.
[time=1872] You take more than you should. You take what really isn't yours, and to you, God's word this morning is, you're judged.
[time=1882] You plan and execute schemes that hurt and take away from others.
[time=1888] Micah speaks out against those who, with their unchecked greed and desire for more, violate others and in violating others in this fashion, violate the tenth commandment,
[time=1900] which is, for those of you who remember the ten commandments, that last one is, do not what?
[time=1908] Say again? Good. Go back to Exodus, everybody. Let me hear the pages turn. Exodus 20, let's just go back to the ten commandments.
[time=1917] Maybe it's been a while since you've been there. Let's just talk about this. Let's teach about this just for a few minutes here.
[time=1923] Genesis, Exodus, chapter 20, verse 17. Here we see the heart of God. Here we see the character of God.
[time=1931] As he lays out for his people, these endeavors, he wanted them desperately to stay away from.
[time=1938] These things that represented his law. There were ten of them initially in 17. We see the tenth. You shall not what?
[time=1948] Say it. Covid. You shall not want. You shall not covet. You shall not think about it in a way whereby you begin to devise a plan to have it.
[time=1962] This is coveting. You shall not covet. What's it say? You shall not covet your neighbor's house.
[time=1970] You shall not covet your neighbor's wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your who?
[time=1982] Neighbor. Anything that's theirs isn't yours. And if it's theirs, it's not for you to have.
[time=1994] This was so much on the heart of God. You see it all the way through his writings and what he delivers to his people.
[time=2002] Go over just a chapter or two. Go to 22, 26. Exodus 22, 26. You're just supposed to be gracious and kind.
[time=2017] 21, it won't be on the screen. You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.
[time=2026] You shall not afflict any widow or orphan. My anger will come if that's the case. Look at 22, 26. If you ever take your neighbor's cloak.
[time=2039] Now we're not talking about house right now. We're not talking about wife. We're just talking about his jacket.
[time=2045] You shall not, it says in 26. If you ever take your neighbor's cloak as a pledge, you are to return it to him before the sun sets.
[time=2053] For that is his only covering. Listen, it is his cloak for his body. What else shall he sleep in? And it shall come about that when he cries out to me, I'll hear him for I, your God, Israel, is what? Say it.
[time=2070] Gracious. Our God is a gracious God. He's a good God. He's not about taking. He's about giving.
[time=2085] Property, as you read through Exodus, as you study that, property in God's economy with the people of Israel was ultimately permanent.
[time=2093] Possession was everything. And if someone lost theirs or if you took it from them, they were done. And you could easily sit here this morning and say, okay, thank you for that little bit of history and teaching.
[time=2105] Let's move on, Kelly. I'm not taking anyone's property. I think we're good to go. And you probably are.
[time=2116] But let me just ask you a couple of questions. Can I?
[time=2122] Have you manipulated in any way, shape, or form dishonest gain from someone on a large or small scale at all in recent days?
[time=2149] If you have, you've taken what wasn't yours. And God's not about that. God will hear their cry and he'll meet their need because he's a gracious God.
[time=2162] Be gracious, the word says. Have you planned out, maybe in your bed at night, to be consistent with the text or maybe somewhere else?
[time=2175] Have you planned out sin for profit? Have you? In any way, shape, or form? Have you planned out sin for profit?
[time=2188] Have you planned out sin to get? If you have, you're guilty of taking from someone else that which isn't yours.
[time=2203] It was stealing kind of heavy. So I just wrote this one down. If you borrowed something and not returned it.
[time=2212] You shouldn't laugh. It's serious. Have you borrowed something and I'll say it's serious? Have you borrowed something and not returned it?
[time=2220] You should. It's not yours.
[time=2226] Could you have met a need and you didn't?
[time=2232] Because you simply chose selfishness over graciousness.
[time=2239] It's important on that front, my friends, to remember that sometimes are taking from others. Sometimes our sin against others is passive.
[time=2248] It's not always overt. It's not always aggressive. It's not always here. Give me that. I want that.
[time=2254] Sometimes you sin against them. Sometimes we take from them passively. Here in Micah 2, we see God addressing the sin of gain at the expense of others.
[time=2263] Remember in your affluence, how many of you were affluent? Raise your hand. Let me see again. Thank you. Remember in your affluence, there will always be people in your life that you can help or hurt.
[time=2272] Always will be. People you can take from or give to. Remember God's own character and God's design for us has always been graciousness, generousness, kindness, giving, not taking, honoring, not defrauding.
[time=2292] God had been saying this all along. Beloving. And Israel hadn't. Israel chose otherwise.
[time=2303] And so look at what God says. Micah 2 verses 3 to 5. Back to the book of Micah.
[time=2312] Chapter 2, verse 3, "Therefore, as us says the Lord, Behold, I am planning against this family a calamity from which you cannot remove your necks, and you will not walk hodily, arrogantly, proudly.
[time=2326] For it will be a time. It will be an evil time. On that day, they will take up against you a taunt and utter a bitter lamentation and say, "We are completely destroyed."
[time=2341] He exchanges the portion of my people. How He removes it from me. To the apostate, He apportions our fields.
[time=2351] Therefore, you will have no one stretching a measuring line for you by lot in the assembly of the Lord."
[time=2362] Micah 2 verses 3 to 5. Like chickens. Like chickens with their necks on the block. They're about to meet their doom.
[time=2373] The word calamity, Church, I want to have you focus on this for a few minutes this morning.
[time=2379] The word calamity here in the text, I'll take you back there. You see it in verse 3. "Therefore, I am planning against this family a calamity."
[time=2389] In the original language here, this word means swift, unrelenting disaster.
[time=2395] He is planning against His family these stiff-necked, unrelenting, unrepentant, proud, arrogant, unfaithful people who will not turn from their ways, who we love deeply.
[time=2415] He's planning against His family. He says here in the scriptures a calamity, swift, unrelenting disaster.
[time=2422] Let's study this concept just for a moment, shall we? Go back in your text to Proverbs.
[time=2427] You get the Psalms and you just kind of keep going. Go to Proverbs chapter 1, if you will.
[time=2433] Let's look at this idea of calamity. It is sometimes an aspect of God's dealing with His people.
[time=2441] And look, I want you to see this as we read in Proverbs chapter 1, 23. Look what it is that so many times prompts our God toward this kind of action.
[time=2453] Proverbs 1, 23. He says, "Turn to my reproof." You see it there? "Turn to my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.
[time=2464] I will make my words known to you." Stop right there. Simply in the text there, simply that it began with "turn to my reproof."
[time=2473] What it communicates is clearly that the people He's dealing with here were in sin.
[time=2478] What was going on shouldn't have been going on. What was being said shouldn't have been being said.
[time=2483] The attitude in the heart of those who He deals with in this case was such that He's begging them to turn and move in a different direction.
[time=2495] Proverbs 1, 23. I will make my words known to you. Keep going. Look at 24 because I called you and you refused.
[time=2503] I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention and you neglected all my counsel and did not want my reproof.
[time=2512] So, verse 26, I will also laugh at your what? Say it, church. I will also laugh at your calamity.
[time=2521] I will mock when your dread comes. When your dread comes like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind
[time=2529] when distress and anguish come upon you, which is synonymous with calamity, distress and anguish,
[time=2537] then they will call on me, but I will not what? Answer. Then they will seek me diligently, but they will not find me
[time=2546] because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord. They would not accept my counsel.
[time=2555] They spurned all my reproof, so they shall eat of the fruit of their own way and be satiated, inundated, surrounded by, devoured in, to create word, be satiated with their own devices.
[time=2574] Look at 32, for the waywardness of the naive will kill them and the complacency of fools will destroy them.
[time=2587] But he who listens to me, 33, shall live securely. You want to know the opposite of calamity? Security. Peace.
[time=2603] The text says back in Micah. The text says in verse 4, I don't know if you were following along.
[time=2611] Actually, go to Proverbs 6. Before we move away from calamity, I do want you to see that. 6-12.
[time=2619] Proverbs 6-12, it says there along the same lines of calamity and the hardheartedness of the people. Proverbs 6, verse 12, I think it's going to be on the screen here for you.
[time=2636] We're getting there. A worthless person, a wicked man, is the one who walks with a perverse mouth. He goes on in verse 13 and says, who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, who points with his fingers.
[time=2658] In 14, he goes on to say, who with perversity in his heart continually, there's our word scheming, schemes in bed, Micah 2, devises evil, Proverbs 6, who continually devises evil, who spreads strife and then look at 6-15.
[time=2677] Therefore, his what? Say it, Church, his calamity will come suddenly. Instantly, he will be broken and there will be no healing. It's a powerful verse, isn't it?
[time=2691] And I know I'm struck by, as I know many of you are struck by, the idea of instantly. God's patience with you and me is astounding, isn't it?
[time=2705] Then there is at times in the midst of your weightwardness, in the midst of my unfaithfulness, in the midst of our relenting iniquity, there are times when, boom, it comes.
[time=2720] Calamity, from God, toward those who are proud and perverse in heart.
[time=2729] Back to Micah, it said there in chapter 2, verse 4, on that day they will take up against you a taunt and utter a bitter lamentation and say, now this is the people of God, this is Israel kind of calling out in the midst of God coming against them.
[time=2746] We are completely destroyed. He exchanges the portion of my people, how he removes it from me to the apostate, he apportions our fields.
[time=2756] Do you see that? To the apostate, he apportions, or he gives away our fields. Who's the apostate? What's God? What's Micah speaking to here?
[time=2766] What he's speaking to my friends is, a Syria was coming. 722, the whole thing was going to fold up, judgment was going to be delivered, a Syria was going to take them captive, and all the, listen, all the fields, and all the cloaks, and all the stuff that they had ripped people off of, all the things they had taken for greedy gain.
[time=2791] All their land that they had acquired through sinful means was going to be given away to a Syria.
[time=2801] All they gained, by their scheming, they will now lose, and it's a great reminder for you and I. I hope you'll write this down. I hope you'll remember this. Nothing gained at the expense of another will ever be blessed or kept.
[time=2817] Nothing gained at the expense of another will ever be blessed or kept. You can guarantee yourself of that. You may keep it for a year, it may be ten, but there will be a day, and you will lose it.
[time=2829] Justice will occur. So what? So don't do it.
[time=2839] Don't covet your neighbor's house. Don't plan at night to take that little extra you want.
[time=2847] Stay away from those attitudes and those actions that draw you and I to engage in planning and scheming and thinking so we can get at the expense of others. He says, don't do it.
[time=2864] Look at verse six. I find this shocking. I, on the other hand, find it so typical. I find it sad and tragic here in chapter two, verse six. We in essence see the response of the people of Israel as they've listened at least for five verses here in chapter two to the
[time=2882] prophet as he delivers what God had called him to deliver and as Michael lays all this out and pleads with the people and God interjects and delivers his judgment of what's coming, the people in essence say in verse six. You can read it there. Do not speak out.
[time=2899] You see that on the screen? Verse six, do not speak out. You want to know what that translates to in the vernacular of our day? Micah, shut up.
[time=2918] This is their response and we wonder why they're in the predicament that they're in as God's word is delivered and as that word speaks to the arrogance and the pridefulness of their lives and their hearts, their response is a micah shut up.
[time=2938] And this says a lot. I had a very, I had a very difficult conversation with someone that I love deeply in recent days. One of those conversations many of you in the room have had to have them and you know how difficult it is.
[time=2960] You're thinking about it all the way into work in the morning. You're praying, asking God to give you the grace to say it well. You know it's time to have the conversation. You know things need to be said.
[time=2971] You want to be able to communicate the severity of the situation while at the same time communicating your love for that person.
[time=2981] It's a very hard conversation to have anybody who knows me, knows I don't like having those conversations. But I've been growing and I know clearly today there are times when it's just an absolute necessity.
[time=2995] And in this case it was and I just kind of jumped in and kind of delivered my spiel and I again just prayed that God would use my words and that somehow we could move to a place of health and restoration.
[time=3009] As soon as I got done it took about 15 minutes. The individual looked up at me and said thank you.
[time=3022] Thank you so much for taking the time to say that to me. People haven't said that to me in a long, long time. And I know you and I know how hard that was for you to say that to me.
[time=3037] Will you help me? They said, will you help me work on these things? Could you help bring others alongside me where I could work on these things?
[time=3047] And you see when you hear that you know what you're dealing with is someone who is walking. What does God require that we do justice, love mercy and walk? What? Humbly.
[time=3061] See when the truth gets laid out and it's really, really clear. And when that truth comes from God, not that I was God in this person's life, but I was just trying to represent what was true.
[time=3073] Our response should be. Your response should be. My response should be to this kind of message. Oh, God, I'm sorry. Please help me get better at these things.
[time=3088] And they say, shut up, Micah. They say, shut up. I love the new living translation, the NLT in verse seven in response to their shut up Micah.
[time=3102] Should you talk that way? Oh, family of Israel. Should you talk that way? Oh, family of Israel, this will be on the screen.
[time=3112] Micah two seven in the NLT. Will the Lord's Spirit have patience with such behavior? If you would do what is right, you would find my words comforting.
[time=3127] Should you talk that way? Oh, family of Israel. Should you talk that way? Child of God.
[time=3135] Should you talk that way? Follow or if Jesus Christ, should we talk that way or should we be humble? Israel chose to talk that way.
[time=3146] You who with a loud voice seek to silence my prophet, look what you've done. Look at verse eight. Chapter two verses eight and nine.
[time=3155] Recently my people have arisen as an enemy. They were the children of God. Now they're an enemy. You stripped the robe off the garment from unsuspecting passerby from those returned from war.
[time=3168] It got so bad. They're stripping off robes from the guys who were coming back from battle. The guys who would sacrifice their lives for the family are getting hosed on their way into the gate.
[time=3181] People stealing from them. Taking what wasn't theirs. The women of my people, you evict here. It refers to widows and women in need.
[time=3191] The women of my people, you evict each one from her pleasant house, from her children. You take my splendor forever.
[time=3201] So Micah in essence says you will. God says through Micah you will suffer a devastating judgment. Look at verse ten. Arise and go. Arise and go for this is no place of rest.
[time=3214] Because of the uncleanness that brings on destruction and a painful destruction it will be.
[time=3224] Let me ask if you would this morning to just bow your heads and close your eyes right where you are right there in your seat and right there at this place in your life.
[time=3237] I want to just give you a moment in the quietness of the room to before God. Admit whatever may need to be admitted to confess whatever may need to be confessed.
[time=3249] Because you know and I know that God's goodness and God's graciousness, his faithfulness with you has been thorough.
[time=3258] There may be some things stirring in your heart this morning as you hear these words and it may be minuscule, it may be moderate, it might be huge.
[time=3268] But you've been scheming, you've been planning, you've been coveting, you've been wanting and that coveting and that wanting has led you to actually begin to take actions whereby you bring to yourself that which isn't yours.
[time=3285] And God says don't do it. And so I want to just give you a chance this morning in the quietness of the room to make that right, to confess that to him.
[time=3308] And as a messenger, which I feel like I am at times, just trying my best to faithfully stand here and articulate what God has said to us, I want to just remind you that his patience isn't forever and that there may be times where calamity will come.
[time=3326] Where his discipline, Stephen I talked about it last week, his discipline may be exercised.
[time=3334] And my prayer and my hope for you is that you wouldn't have to endure that, that you could today turn from your sin and move in a direction of obedience.
[time=3346] And here's the deal on the coveting, here's the deal on the scheming to get what you don't have, you scheme to get what you don't have, you take what isn't yours because you're not content.
[time=3358] Amen?
[time=3361] You lack contentment, somehow you think that that thing over there is somehow going to bring a sense of rest and peace to your soul that Christ doesn't.
[time=3375] And as you confess, and as you admit your sin this morning, I pray with you and I pray for you, that you would sense in greater levels to greater degrees.
[time=3389] The contentment that comes in knowing Christ, the understanding that your needs are met and that his provision for you, whatever that looks like today, is perfect.
[time=3402] Father in heaven, his confession is made this morning as people pray in their hearts for the forgiveness that they need.
[time=3410] God, as many people in this room strike a posture, not of shut up Micah, but oh God, please forgive me.
[time=3418] Know how thankful we are Father for the opportunity you provide for repentance.
[time=3424] How these words from Micah to a stiff-necked people who had been unfaithful time after time, God, they are a timely reminder for many of us in this room today.
[time=3436] As we've been reminded, God, and as we've been taught, may we leave this place different.
[time=3442] We've seen today that in your character, God, in your design, you've always been about graciousness.
[time=3448] You've always been about giving. God, you've always been generous.
[time=3454] Father, I pray that we could leave with that spirit in us, with that mindset, with that picture.
[time=3461] God, thank you for this time together, thank you for hearing our cries, thank you for hearing our prayers this morning for the persecuted church.
[time=3471] God, thank you for the family that you've given us here. May we continue to walk this road of growth together in the days to come.
[time=3480] May you be honored, and may we make much of you in the process for its in your son's name. We pray. Amen.
