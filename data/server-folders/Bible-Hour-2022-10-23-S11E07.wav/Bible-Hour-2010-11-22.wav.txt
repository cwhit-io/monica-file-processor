[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hey everybody, welcome back to the Bible album.
[time=35] We're thankful that you've tuned into the broadcast and it's good to be here with you.
[time=39] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of, as most of you know, of serving on the team here at Blackhawk, and at Blackhawk, we are immensely passionate about a number of things, one of which is this.
[time=50] We believe deeply that the church has got to be a people who are willing to penetrate and go out from this place that we enjoy, we love being together, we love it when folks come through the doors, we love the teaching and the worship that takes place when the body of Christ gathers, but the body of Christ has to go.
[time=70] It's gotta go out and meet people in this culture and in this world in ways that are relevant and meaningful.
[time=77] And this morning, I'm so thankful to have a good friend of my Mr. Clinton Foppel, most of you who are familiar at all with the Bible hour know that Clinton has been a part of what we've done here in the past.
[time=89] We have a partnership and a friendship that God's been growing, and Clinton is the executive director of Remedy FM, and Remedy is, I'll let him describe it to you, but it is a tool that God is using to reach into this culture, especially the students and the youth of this culture in a powerful way online.
[time=109] It's incredible what God has been doing.
[time=111] It's good to see you, my friend.
[time=112] - It's always good to see you, bro.
[time=113] - Thank you for being here.
[time=114] - You know, the reality is every time I come to Blackhawk, I'm reminded because of the school here of why I do what I do.
[time=121] Teens are so important to me, been in youth ministry almost 20 years, ordained 15 years, saw the church, you know, go through all kinds of transitions and try to deal with the issues that kids are going through.
[time=133] And it's just no secret if you've got a teenager that they're texting, they're online all the time.
[time=140] The average right now is 15 to 20 hours a week.
[time=143] And Remedy FM was birthed to be ahead of the tech curve a little bit when it comes to the way we've done church, the way we do missions.
[time=152] And we're spending all of our time, 24 hours a day online, talking to them about biblical ways to live their life.
[time=158] We call it living on purpose and not by accident.
[time=161] And God has just blessed us in the last three years.
[time=164] We turned three in October.
[time=166] And we're just grateful for every day we've had to serve.
[time=169] - That's fantastic.
[time=171] Tell the people who are watching.
[time=173] Give them just, again, there are some people watching right now who completely track with what you're saying.
[time=179] Some people right now are thinking it's a radio station.
[time=181] - No, tell us some of us who might be a little technically challenged, but kingdom minded, the real premise for Remedy FM.
[time=190] - Well, the dot FM, Remedy dot FM, it means that we're on the internet as a music broadcast.
[time=196] And we say it this way.
[time=198] We use music as a vehicle to engage in conversations.
[time=202] If you're not familiar with the internet, then you don't know that one of the best ways to interact with people is to chat conversation.
[time=209] And email is kind of becoming not so cool anymore.
[time=213] So Facebook is big, Facebook messaging.
[time=217] So we use chat interaction, computer to computer from our studios downtown Fort Wayne to all the states of the US of A, 186 countries in total where we interact with kids.
[time=230] And basically what I've kind of described this as, we're like an online confessional.
[time=234] Kelly, in the last week, we launched a brand new component to our website, encourage you to check it out.
[time=239] It's just a confession box right in the middle of our website.
[time=242] And in less than a week, we've already got like 200 confessions.
[time=246] That as a pastor, as a father, would break your heart.
[time=250] Really broken, honest, transparent confessions.
[time=254] But the reason why we're doing that is we're trying to move a generation to understand that it's biblical to confess our sins one to another.
[time=260] And if it takes that website to start that ball rolling and then move into a dialogue with one of our VJs and then get to a place where we can start interacting and get them into God's word and get them seen that they were created by a God.
[time=273] They're not an accident of evolution.
[time=275] They're created with a purpose.
[time=277] We can see life change.
[time=278] And I could talk all afternoon about the stories, the way that God has used this ministry to call kids to live a life of purpose.
[time=287] - Awesome, I know that's true.
[time=289] I know you could talk and I'd love to listen.
[time=293] Let's do this.
[time=294] I know you have statistics and demographics and a lot of data just so the folks can be encouraged.
[time=301] When you talk about connecting with kids, give them an idea of how many young people, the MDFM has actually connected with over the years.
[time=309] - Well, we try to do benchmarks regularly.
[time=313] Every computer has an IP address.
[time=316] And in radio, you do a lot of guesswork.
[time=319] It's based on an arbitron book.
[time=321] But in our world, I can tell you how many listen, what city they're from, how long they listen.
[time=326] And so in June, we had a regular listenership of a quarter of a million teenagers around this country.
[time=332] And we were very proud of that because the Lord has been the one that's been our marketing agent.
[time=339] We haven't been able to advertise because of the recession.
[time=342] We haven't been able to do much strategy on Google and all these different places.
[time=347] So God has been spreading the word.
[time=349] Parents, teenagers have been spreading the word.
[time=352] And so that's our audience.
[time=354] Now, chat wise, we talked last year alone to well over 30,000 of them, very intimately.
[time=361] So you take the quarter million list name regularly.
[time=363] Now you take it down to about 30,000 where they're dumping the deep, dark stuff.
[time=368] But it's with an ability to be able to create relationship and Kelly, when you take a young woman and you help her understand how to deal with whatever she's gone through, with a biblical response that Christ wants us to live a life to the full, and you watch across the line of faith on a computer screen, you get baffled as to how the Holy Spirit works.
[time=390] We put them in the church and we put them in, in that congregational like meeting, but God is at work all around the world.
[time=399] And I liken it to the fact that the Romans built these roads to carry the armies into the villages they conquered.
[time=405] Well, shortly after the missionaries used those same roads to bring the gospel.
[time=410] And we're using the same thing with the internet.
[time=411] - Yeah, fantastic.
[time=413] As we wrap this up, I know there are people watching who would be really encouraged to just hear you maybe just pick a story.
[time=424] I know there are many.
[time=426] But in recent days, as the remedy team has done its best to represent the truth and the hope found in Jesus Christ to a generation that you and I both know, are struggling, a story of a young person that you've had the privilege of coming alongside and encouraging.
[time=444] - Well, I could really take us down a sad road of recent kids that have tried to take their life and we've been able to be there.
[time=452] We've had over 54 Kelli since we started three years ago, kids that we have taken their confessions of at eight o'clock tonight, I'm gonna do it.
[time=461] This weekend I planned to end my life.
[time=463] Incredible vulnerable confessions because we're not in their life so they think they can just say those things to us and kind of dump it on us.
[time=470] But we've been able to help them get into behavioral health and get them into hospitalization so they can get the care that they need.
[time=477] But I'll tell you the most exciting story and something I'm gonna get to enjoy this next week.
[time=481] Young Lady finds one of our shows on Wicca.
[time=484] Fast growing religion among teenagers thanks to Harry Potter and all these Twilight movies.
[time=489] And she found it, didn't like it, wasn't a Christian, hated the show I did, you know, Bible-based, taking these issues like sexualization of culture and comparing it to the Bible.
[time=500] Walked her through it in the show and she began to argue with our VJs about this concept and we always love kids where they're at.
[time=508] We have a chat, listen, love, philosophy.
[time=510] And shortly after that, her cousin committed suicide, successfully.
[time=517] And because God had brought her to remedy to argue, now she came back to remedy to find healing.
[time=524] And we were able to lead her to the Lord.
[time=526] She lives up in Canada of all places where I'm from.
[time=529] And after that, she went back to Lebanon where she actually her family's from and we started seeing all these new viewers in Lebanon that started popping up on our metrics.
[time=539] She was telling her cousins all about remedy and this is a Muslim family for the most part, phenomenal, but still Muslim.
[time=545] And I came back to Canada and said, you know what, we need to find a church.
[time=550] And we were able to get her into a community, much like Black Hawk, that loves her and is helping her grow in her faith and life-on, life-small group community.
[time=557] And so that's one of our T-ball moment success stories and we wanna have many more of those in the years ahead.
[time=563] - That's good.
[time=564] And so do we, we want for Clinton and his team to have thousands more moments just like that.
[time=573] It's why we do all that we can to come alongside and encourage their effort.
[time=577] It's why I say to you without hesitation today if there would be any opportunity that you'd ever have to support remedy in any way, shape, or form, your resources, your prayers, your volunteer involvement.
[time=592] - Can I give you out?
[time=593] Can I give one opportunity once you're wise?
[time=595] If you're a stay-at-home mom or if you're a grandparent, we have a great opportunity for you to log in one hour a week and just chat with these students.
[time=603] We'll do the security check and all that to make sure that you're on the same page as we are biblically and we're just so excited to be able to offer this opportunity but most of us spend that much time online a week.
[time=612] So if you're interested in that visit apply.remity.fm because it's a great way to be an internet missionary and watch God use you through the web.
[time=620] - Thanks for being here.
[time=621] - Love it.
[time=622] - And thanks to all of you for tuning in.
[time=623] Great to have you with us as always and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=629] I was talking with Sandy Wright and Bill Bodecker in the lobby this morning.
[time=635] Sandy's been here since 1976 and she talked to me, I'll tell you where we all were in 1976.
[time=643] Sandy, the guy's in the water right now but she was talking about how every time somebody is baptized it's an occasion for her to remember when she was baptized and the great work that God has done in her own life.
[time=657] We're gonna have baptism and communion back to back here this morning.
[time=662] What a wonderful occasion for us to remember what it is that God has done in our lives and to rejoice this morning with Anna as she is baptized by her brother.
[time=674] Jason, we've got Joe and Andrew, Jason and Anna Maley as was here this morning.
[time=680] Anna to be baptized Jason, her brother one of our hours will be baptized in here today but Anna tell us your story if you would and then we'll have Jason baptize you.
[time=689] - Hello.
[time=693] My name is Anna Hasford
[time=699] and I am married to Michael Hasford and we have two children together, Trinity and Kirsten.
[time=705] They are 10 and nine years old.
[time=707] I was born and raised here in Fort Wayne and I came born and raised here in Fort Wayne and I came from a large family of six, four brothers and a sister.
[time=717] I grew up in a Christ-centered home with my mom and dad.
[time=719] We went to Black Hawk Church in school and we were taught to do our best to build a relationship with Christ.
[time=726] At age five and six I asked Jesus into my heart with my mom.
[time=730] I remember being very excited to tell everybody but unfortunately growing up this way I think I almost took it for granted what a relationship with Christ really was.
[time=740] After that point I think I went on living my life like normal and choosing my own path from there which led me to making pretty hard decisions for the remainder of my life.
[time=750] It wasn't until I was about 25 years old when I remember Kelly Bird preaching about giving everything up to God in a service and I felt that need to do that right then.
[time=761] And for the moment I did.
[time=765] It helped me with things in my life and decisions I was making but I was still feeling very alone and very lost.
[time=772] Most of that was wanting to still do it on my own.
[time=775] Some time had passed and as of two years ago my husband and I were probably at a breaking point of our marriage and also personally.
[time=783] We decided to start a Bible study with some of our friends and family.
[time=789] I would have to say that was probably the best decision we had made yet.
[time=793] We were discussing salvation in our small group and even though I had heard it a million times in my life and I thought I knew it all I was surprised to know that I was very wrong.
[time=803] I was telling another person in our group about living with both being in or teeter-tattering in your face and how it was hard place to be.
[time=812] And then I realized that myself, I myself had not decided what I was going to do with my own life.
[time=817] I think that was kind of the light bulb moment for me.
[time=821] We then moved on to talk more about how God asks us to be baptized immediately following our salvation.
[time=827] And then I realized I had not finished what I was supposed to do for him.
[time=832] I decided that night to be baptized and at that time I knew that I had decided to make Jesus the Lord of my life.
[time=838] I was ready to follow him and not me.
[time=841] (audience applauds) - Great job, Anna, great job.
[time=852] This is awesome, how exciting is this to get to baptize your own sister?
[time=857] I think the choice you made to be part of a small group, I think both of them are out here with you right now was an awesome one, what a great group.
[time=865] And this is great.
[time=868] As your brothers, brothers in blood
[time=874] and brothers in the Lord watching you grow,
[time=880] it is our privilege to baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=886] (audience applauds)
[time=892] [MUSIC - 47 seconds]
[time=944] - All right, will you stay with me for one more song?
[time=953] (gentle music)
[time=969] [MUSIC - 82 seconds]
[time=1056] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 152 seconds]
[time=1217] - Very thankful for the chance that we have to serve you
[time=1229] in all the different ways that we do.
[time=1230] God's reign has a lot to say to us this morning friends
[time=1236] and I don't wanna waste any time.
[time=1238] There's a lot to say, I don't wanna get right into it.
[time=1239] So let's just jump in to the prophet Micah in the Old Testament.
[time=1244] If you're just joining us, we've been in Micah for three weeks now.
[time=1247] Micah chapters one and two, the last few weeks.
[time=1251] Now Micah three and four today.
[time=1253] Just some quick words by way of review.
[time=1255] If you're joining us on the internet or on the Bible hour or if you're here for the first time today, some words about the prophet Micah himself and about the nature of what it means to be a prophet just as a way of introducing all of these things.
[time=1268] Micah is prophesying during the eighth century BC about the years 750 to 700.
[time=1275] And these are troubled times for the nation of Israel and the north and Judah and the south.
[time=1282] How that came about is a longer story.
[time=1286] Economically prosperous, spiritually bankrupt.
[time=1290] Bad combination.
[time=1291] Micah one is filled up with an indictment against the people of Israel and Judah for their idolatry and their gross, their extreme wickedness.
[time=1302] Micah one makes it very, very clear that God has issues with the way things are going among his people.
[time=1311] We talked a couple weeks ago about the nature of what a prophet does.
[time=1315] A prophet is not necessarily only one who just tells us the future.
[time=1321] That's a nature, that's part of what prophets do, but less than 1% what we read in the prophets has yet to be fulfilled in our own day.
[time=1330] So what prophets really do is say this phrase.
[time=1332] You see it everywhere in the prophets.
[time=1335] This is what the Lord says.
[time=1337] Thus says the Lord.
[time=1338] They speak on his behalf.
[time=1341] They're his spokesman.
[time=1342] They're his mouthpiece.
[time=1344] They're his messengers.
[time=1345] That's what prophets do.
[time=1347] Micah, the prophet, is in the Old Testament.
[time=1349] The Old Testament ends in the English Bible with 12 minor prophets.
[time=1353] Hosea is the first.
[time=1355] Malachi is the last.
[time=1356] Micah's right somewhere in the middle.
[time=1358] So if you're, again in Hosea, you can turn right to find Micah if you're in Malachi, you can turn left to find Micah.
[time=1365] Micah one ends with this beautiful word play of the approaching Assyrian armies.
[time=1373] Assyria destroys the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 BC.
[time=1378] And Micah is prophesying and working among the people in these days and the armies are marching southward.
[time=1384] All those places, Morish, F. Gath and the places listed those villages at the end of Micah one are real places that were really destroyed by the Assyrian armies.
[time=1394] And people are streaming into Jerusalem's walls to find safety.
[time=1398] It's a very, very bad scene.
[time=1401] Micah two continues.
[time=1402] Friends, what's the first word of Micah chapter two?
[time=1405] Whoa, and the word in Hebrew for whoa is oi.
[time=1410] Like oi vai, you may have heard that before.
[time=1412] Whoa is me is an actual translation of that.
[time=1415] I would encourage you in the time that we're in Micah, it will be in Micah for two more weeks.
[time=1421] I would encourage you during the week, if you wanna just go through and read Micah, to read it in the new living translation as one of the ways that you interact with Micah.
[time=1430] The living Bible as was a few years ago was a paraphrase.
[time=1433] The new living translation isn't a paraphrase.
[time=1436] It's a translation that I found to be very, very helpful, especially in the Old Testament.
[time=1440] So if you would jot that down in your bulletin, there are some notes for the sermon today in your bulletin.
[time=1445] Jot down the NLT, you can find it online.
[time=1448] I would encourage you to take note of it.
[time=1450] One way in which that's helpful is this.
[time=1452] It translates the word whoa is as what sorrow awaits.
[time=1458] What sorrow awaits those who devise wickedness who verse one, Micah two, who work evil on their beds.
[time=1466] What sorrow awaits for those people.
[time=1470] That's the nature of what the word whoa means.
[time=1472] And I found that to be very helpful.
[time=1474] If you move on down to verse four of Micah two, again by way of review and just to be clear, there's a word in Micah two verse four that we need to explain more carefully.
[time=1483] And the word there is taunt.
[time=1485] It says in that day, they shall take up a taunt song against you and moan bitterly.
[time=1492] You get penalties in football for taunting your opponent.
[time=1497] If someone gets tackled with some great violence, someone goes, ah, taunting, you can get a 15-hour penalty for that, that that's against the rules.
[time=1505] That's not what taunting means in Micah two, verse four.
[time=1508] In Micah two, verse four, it's like this.
[time=1511] This person has met a bad end.
[time=1513] And the prophet holds up the person who is gonna meet a bad end and says, don't be like this person.
[time=1519] That's what a taunt in the Old Testament is.
[time=1521] It's all over the place in the prophets.
[time=1523] And so a taunt means they're gonna come to a bad end.
[time=1527] Reader, don't be like them.
[time=1530] This person who has loved the evil and hated the good, don't be like them.
[time=1535] That's the nature of what it means to taunt, just by way to comfort you in that way, in the Old Testament.
[time=1541] The last two verses of Micah two are little glimmer of hope.
[time=1546] So if you'd go there with me, Micah two, verses 12 and 13.
[time=1551] The wheel is turning in Micah.
[time=1554] It's judgment and then hope.
[time=1556] Judgment and then hope around and around it goes.
[time=1559] Micah gets these visions kind of like his parade floats, traveling past his village.
[time=1565] He sees them in that way.
[time=1567] That's the best way I could explain it to you.
[time=1568] Look at Micah two, verses 12 and 13.
[time=1570] I will surely assemble all of you, O Jacob.
[time=1575] I will gather the remnant of Israel.
[time=1577] I will set them together like sheep in a fold, like a flock in its pasture, a noisy multitude of men.
[time=1584] He who opens the breach, he who makes a way of escape, busted the wall down, let people can go out through the breach, goes up before them.
[time=1593] They break through and pass the gate going out by it.
[time=1597] Their king passes on before them, the Lord at their head.
[time=1603] File that away, the king leading the nation of Israel out of exile into freedom.
[time=1609] So much more to say about that.
[time=1613] Again, in your bulletin state, there are some notes.
[time=1615] If you follow along, we're in Micah chapter three now, reading the first few verses.
[time=1621] Here the wheel turns back from hope.
[time=1624] Now it's back to judgment.
[time=1626] And I said, Micah speaking on the Lord's behalf, here you heads of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel.
[time=1634] Is it not for you to know justice?
[time=1636] Aren't you supposed to know what's right?
[time=1640] In other words, you who hate the good and love the evil
[time=1646] who tear the skin from off my people.
[time=1649] They're flushed from off their bones, eat the flesh of my people, flay their skin from off them, break their bones into pieces and chop them up like meat in a pot, like flesh in a cauldron.
[time=1662] The first bullet point on your outlines friends is there's no justice.
[time=1667] The very people who these local leaders are supposed to protect are being ground up like meat in a pot, like stew.
[time=1676] It's very gruesome imagery.
[time=1679] I think it does a good job again of putting on display for us that sin is very, very serious.
[time=1687] There is no way to escape it on a day that we take communion together.
[time=1692] There's no way to escape the seriousness of what we just did.
[time=1697] That my sin cost the life of the Son of God.
[time=1702] It's a very serious thing.
[time=1704] The rulers, these heads and rulers of Israel, they probably were, if you look at verse one, these heads of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel, probably these local civil magistrates who would sit in the city squares and sell disputes, probably these people.
[time=1718] And these people hated what was good and loved what was evil.
[time=1724] If you are going to a person in a courtroom, how do we refer to judges in courtrooms these days?
[time=1731] By what title?
[time=1732] Your honor, we do that because we value justice.
[time=1737] This person with the gavel in the long robe deserves my respect.
[time=1741] And so I will give him an honorable and honorific title.
[time=1745] Your honor, he deserves honor, why?
[time=1749] Because he loves justice, or he's supposed to, or she's supposed to.
[time=1754] Can you imagine if they didn't?
[time=1756] If you had no hope in a courtroom of reaching a fair verdict, it was like Al Capone in Chicago in the gangster age, and the judges are all paid off and the juries filled up with people that would do what he wants to do, that would be the sense of it.
[time=1771] And that is where we are in Israel.
[time=1774] And Micah, the Lord, through Micah, says this should not be.
[time=1778] Shouldn't you know justice?
[time=1780] Shouldn't you know what's right?
[time=1782] The answer is yes, it's a rhetorical question.
[time=1785] Verse four, you see the consequence of their sin.
[time=1791] There's gonna be the word therefore, friends, or then showing up a few times this morning.
[time=1796] Sin has consequences.
[time=1802] The most loving thing, please hear me, the most loving thing that we can do for those in our lives, our friends, our family, our neighbors, our coworkers, is to tell them the truth.
[time=1814] That is the most loving thing that we can do for them, and what is the truth?
[time=1819] In this case, it is that the only remedy for my sin condition is salvation through Jesus Christ.
[time=1827] That is the only remedy for sin.
[time=1831] It is not loving to pretend as though there are 14 different ways to be freed from your sin and act like that's okay, that's not loving.
[time=1840] There is a way to say that unlovingly.
[time=1842] There's a way to say that that's not gentle and not respectful, we've all seen that before.
[time=1847] But fundamentally, friends, it's not loving.
[time=1849] It's not helpful, it's not compassionate to not tell the truth.
[time=1853] This is a quote from Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
[time=1857] Dietrich Bonhoeffer, we've quoted him many times before, together, this quote is in the Digging Deeper document from last week's sermon.
[time=1864] I thought it was important to show it to you again.
[time=1866] That document's posted middle of the week on our church website, it's a new website, it looks great.
[time=1871] We relaunched it last couple of days, I would encourage you.
[time=1874] This is another quote from his book called Life Together.
[time=1878] The more we learn to allow others to speak the word to us, to accept humbly and gratefully even severe reproaches and admonitions, don't do this.
[time=1889] The more free and objective will we be in speaking ourselves?
[time=1893] The humble person will stick to truth and love.
[time=1897] He will stick to the word of God and let it lead him to his brother, correction is unavoidable.
[time=1904] God's word demands it when a brother falls into open sin, the quote concludes this way.
[time=1911] Nothing can be more cruel than the tenderness that consigns another to his sin.
[time=1918] Nothing can be more cruel than the tenderness
[time=1924] that consigns another person to his sin, meaning it's okay, your sins no big deal, don't worry about it.
[time=1931] Nothing could be more cruel than that.
[time=1932] We are not helping our children by enabling them in their sin.
[time=1938] We are not.
[time=1939] And the prophet Micah in Israel says this should not be.
[time=1944] Those that love justice, they hate it.
[time=1948] Those that should love what's good, hate what's good, no.
[time=1952] No.
[time=1954] Friends, the bad news has to precede the good news.
[time=1958] If you don't know what you've been saved from, then why would you even talk saved?
[time=1964] Saved from what?
[time=1965] My unsaved friends on the telephone, we talk.
[time=1968] And the issue we have often is how are you doing spiritually?
[time=1974] Let's say, oh, I'm doing fine, I'm doing great.
[time=1976] Never been better, living a righteous life.
[time=1978] Well, what does that mean?
[time=1979] It's not God's definition of righteous.
[time=1982] The most cruel thing I could do is to pretend like that's no big deal.
[time=1987] You can define it any way you want to.
[time=1989] People in my life, guys, more and more, maybe not your life, but in the lives that I'm, I suspect in your life too, don't really sense the need for salvation.
[time=2000] We have to proclaim the gospel, which is good news.
[time=2005] And part of that is that God is not going to take our sin and sweep under the rug.
[time=2011] It was dealt with at the cross and only at the cross.
[time=2014] We need to proclaim that message.
[time=2016] And in verse one, two, three, and four, the prophet Micah is holding up an international distress signal.
[time=2023] In 1976, Congress passed this resolutions.
[time=2028] U.S. Code 36, chapter 10, it says this, about the U.S. flag.
[time=2033] The U.S. flag should never be displayed with a union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life and property.
[time=2049] Friends, in Israel, the union, the flag is upside down.
[time=2054] There is excessive danger to life and property going on in Micah three and acting like it's not is irresponsible.
[time=2061] It is irresponsible.
[time=2062] What they've had done essentially is hire wolves
[time=2068] to be shepherds, which is a bad hire.
[time=2072] I'm just saying.
[time=2077] Then they will cry to the Lord, but he will not answer them.
[time=2081] That is not pleasant for me to read, but there it is.
[time=2086] Let her be in your outline is just that, it's no answer, no justice, and then let her be, no answer.
[time=2092] Verse five begins with this very famous four word phrase.
[time=2097] Thus says the Lord.
[time=2098] Micah is not speaking on his own behalf.
[time=2101] Micah speaking on God's behalf.
[time=2102] This is what God says.
[time=2103] If your beef is with me, fine.
[time=2106] This is what God says.
[time=2108] People that don't like the gospel and its proclamation in our lives, friends, their argument is not with you.
[time=2115] Move it away from you.
[time=2118] It's not your opinion.
[time=2121] Then you're gonna lose every single time.
[time=2123] If you make it your opinion.
[time=2124] This is what God says.
[time=2126] Make it as clear as you can, lovingly, gently, respectfully speaking the truth and love.
[time=2133] The prophet's main role.
[time=2134] That's what prophets do.
[time=2135] They speak on God's behalf or God's mouthpiece.
[time=2138] No answer from God because of what they've done.
[time=2143] There are consequences.
[time=2145] Look at verse four.
[time=2145] Again, I moved away from verse four too soon.
[time=2148] Very important word in verse four is the word because.
[time=2152] He will hide his face from them at that time because they've made their deeds evil.
[time=2157] God will hide his face for a reason.
[time=2160] God isn't just having a fit.
[time=2164] He isn't having a fit of rage.
[time=2166] God doesn't have fits.
[time=2168] God isn't prone to what the ancient near Eastern gods, those ancient gods, all those other gods of the world.
[time=2172] They had fits of rage and jealousy and anger and lust and all of it but God's not like that.
[time=2177] He doesn't have fits.
[time=2178] He always behaves the way he behaves for a reason.
[time=2183] And he wants us to know what it is.
[time=2185] He wants to be known.
[time=2186] He wants to be found.
[time=2187] He wants to be loved for himself.
[time=2190] But there is a consequence to sin.
[time=2193] Look at verse five.
[time=2194] This is the Lord concerning the prophets.
[time=2196] It's now it's off on these heads.
[time=2197] Now it's the false prophets who lead my people astray who say peace when they have something to eat but declare war against them who puts nothing into their mouths.
[time=2208] The new living translation reads this way in verse five.
[time=2210] You false prophets are leading my people astray.
[time=2212] It's personal for God.
[time=2214] Leading my people astray.
[time=2216] You promise peace for those who give you food but you declare war on those who refuse to feed you.
[time=2221] That's the sense of it.
[time=2223] Give me what I want, I'll give you a good return.
[time=2225] Don't you what I want?
[time=2226] You'll see, you'll pay for that.
[time=2228] Very disturbing.
[time=2229] These are prophets, so-called prophets.
[time=2231] It will be night to you without vision, verse six, darkness, without divination, no answer from God.
[time=2238] The sun will go down on the prophets.
[time=2240] The day will be black over them.
[time=2243] The seers be disgraced.
[time=2244] The diviners put the shame.
[time=2246] It shall cover their lips.
[time=2247] There's no answer from God.
[time=2251] And the first phrase of verse eight puts Micah in a very different category.
[time=2255] Take a look at it.
[time=2256] But as for me, to strong, it's called a strong adversative.
[time=2261] It means it's not this, it's this.
[time=2263] I not like them, I'm like this.
[time=2265] What's he do?
[time=2266] I'm filled with power, verse eight, with the spirit of the Lord, with justice, with mish pot.
[time=2273] Remember Tony's message about mish pot but justice?
[time=2278] The way things ought to be and might to declare to Jacob his transgression into Israel, his sin.
[time=2285] Prophets say hard, truthful things.
[time=2289] And they often killed them for them.
[time=2291] They often said, Micah two says, in verse six, don't preach, nothing bad will happen to us.
[time=2300] Don't say those bad things.
[time=2301] That won't ever happen to us.
[time=2305] Micah declares to Israel and to Jacob, their sin and transgression, the bad news needs to proceed the good, saved.
[time=2313] I've been saved, save from what?
[time=2316] Save from the rightful consequences of my sin only by the blood of Jesus.
[time=2322] This is all my hope.
[time=2323] Did you hear the lyrics of the song?
[time=2326] This is all my hope and peace.
[time=2328] This is all my righteousness.
[time=2330] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[time=2331] Nothing but the blood.
[time=2333] This is not of works.
[time=2335] It's all of grace.
[time=2336] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[time=2338] I didn't earn God's favor.
[time=2340] I could not.
[time=2344] We need to tell people the whole truth.
[time=2351] Saved from what?
[time=2355] The whole truth, friends.
[time=2357] And we can.
[time=2358] It's our privilege.
[time=2359] We're ministers of reconciliation in the world.
[time=2362] May we go forth from this place and do that today.
[time=2366] May God give us the strength to do it by His Holy Spirit.
[time=2368] Let her see, it goes from no justice to no answer from God now to no presence.
[time=2375] They think that God is with them.
[time=2376] Look at verse 11.
[time=2379] Its heads give judgment for a bribe.
[time=2382] Its priests teach for a price.
[time=2383] Its prophets practice divination for money.
[time=2386] Yet they lean on the Lord and say, "Isn't the Lord in the midst of us?" No disaster will come upon us.
[time=2392] The thing bad will happen.
[time=2393] God's on my side.
[time=2394] It reminds me of Abraham Lincoln in Civil War.
[time=2397] Lincoln said, you know the quote.
[time=2400] The point isn't to ask whether God is on our side in the union or the Confederacy, but to ask whether we are on His side.
[time=2407] And the prophets in Israel had lost.
[time=2410] They felt entitled.
[time=2411] They got lazy.
[time=2412] They loved evil.
[time=2414] They hated good.
[time=2415] It says in verse nine that they detest justice.
[time=2420] And the idea of that, even going back to verse two, hating the good, loving the evil as they kept on hating it.
[time=2426] It was a continuous action.
[time=2428] I always hate justice.
[time=2430] I always love the evil.
[time=2431] I always hate the good.
[time=2432] That's the bad news friends.
[time=2435] I am so delighted to tell you that Micah 4 follows after Micah 3.
[time=2440] Before we go to Micah 4, would you go to Luke 13 with me real quick?
[time=2445] Luke 13 in verses 34 and 35.
[time=2447] It should be in the screen behind me.
[time=2450] There are some extra verses there in your bulletins for extra reading for you during the course of the week.
[time=2455] Things that we won't get to this morning, but that really do add flavor and color to this passage.
[time=2460] Luke 13 verses 34 and 35.
[time=2462] In Jesus' day, it was much the same situation.
[time=2469] Those that were charged to take care of the sheep were devouring them.
[time=2472] There's lots of evidence of that in the gospels.
[time=2474] Look at verse 34 of Luke 13.
[time=2476] Oh, Jerusalem.
[time=2478] Jerusalem.
[time=2480] Oh, whoa, in Jesus' voice.
[time=2482] The city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it.
[time=2489] How often, he says, would I have gathered you?
[time=2492] Gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings and you would not.
[time=2501] The Old Testament friends is filled up with information about prophet after prophet coming to Israel and prophet after prophet being imprisoned, tortured, murdered.
[time=2514] Don't say those things to us.
[time=2516] Nothing bad is gonna happen to us.
[time=2517] Surely not.
[time=2518] Behold, I, your house, verse 35 is forsaken.
[time=2525] And I tell you, you will not see me until you say blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=2532] Very serious to reject what it is that God has done.
[time=2538] Back to Micah chapter three with me.
[time=2540] Micah three, verse 10, says this.
[time=2543] "You who build Zion with blood and Jerusalem with iniquity, God will unbuild Jerusalem in 586 with the Babylonians and their invasion.
[time=2552] It will happen.
[time=2553] It will happen." But again, Micah four, we have the bad news.
[time=2557] Sin has consequences.
[time=2559] No justice, no answer, no presence.
[time=2563] God has removed his presence from these people's lives.
[time=2566] Very, very scary stuff.
[time=2567] But Micah four begins to lay out this oracle, this vision of hope and restoration.
[time=2574] There is hope.
[time=2576] Our God saves.
[time=2579] There is hope in his name.
[time=2581] I could not have chosen those songs better today.
[time=2585] There is regard, Micah 400 Bulletins letter A there.
[time=2589] I was gonna say number A, that would make much sense.
[time=2592] Letter A, regard for the Lord, regard for the Lord.
[time=2596] Look at verse one of Micah four.
[time=2598] Would you stand with me as we read Micah four, these first three verses here?
[time=2601] Micah four verses one through five.
[time=2605] Wonderful, wonderful verses.
[time=2609] It shall come to pass in the latter days at the mountain of the house of the Lord will be established as the highest of the mountains.
[time=2616] It shall be lifted up above the hills.
[time=2619] People's shall flow to it.
[time=2621] Many nations shall come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, "to the house of the God of Jacob, "that he may teach us his ways, "that we may walk in his paths, "for out of Zion will go forth the law, "the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
[time=2635] "He will judge between many peoples "and will decide for strong nations of far off, "and they shall beat their swords into plowshares." And their spears into pruning hooks.
[time=2647] Nation will not lift up sword against nation.
[time=2650] They will not learn war anymore, but they shall sit and every man under his vine, under his fig tree, no one shall make them afraid.
[time=2658] The mouth of Yahweh of armies has spoken for all the peoples walk in the name of their God, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.
[time=2668] He may be seated.
[time=2669] Listen to Hebrews one verses one through four.
[time=2677] If you wanna go there, you're welcome to go.
[time=2679] Hebrews one, one through four.
[time=2681] On this phrase, latter days, last days, what's that about?
[time=2685] The author of Hebrews says this in Hebrews one, long ago at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, like Micah.
[time=2694] But in these last days, same phrase, he has spoken to us by his son, whom he appointed the heir of all things.
[time=2704] So the last days for the author of Hebrews began 2,000 years ago.
[time=2710] The latter days for Micah, looking to a day in the future, but that day has begun.
[time=2714] Those days have begun when Jesus put his feet down on the earth.
[time=2717] Acts two says the same thing in Peter's prophecy on Pentecost, very exciting.
[time=2723] It's like in June, 1944, when those brave men from over the world put their feet on the beaches of Western France and Normandy.
[time=2733] The Germans resisted ferociously because they knew as soon as the Allies got a foothold in Europe, it was gonna be done and they were right.
[time=2742] Once the Allied forces got a foothold on the beaches of Normandy and began to sweep eastward across the continent, it was over.
[time=2749] It was the beginning of the end.
[time=2751] And so when Jesus puts his feet on the earth, friends, 2,000 years ago, it's the beginning of the end.
[time=2757] The latter days began with a victory that Christ won over death and sin and hell when he was crucified and when he rose again.
[time=2765] The latter days, we've been in the latter days for 2,000 years.
[time=2768] So we're in my daughter would call this the various end.
[time=2771] We're at the various end of days now.
[time=2775] So much closer to his return.
[time=2779] When he comes our glorious king, all his ransomed home to bring, then anew this song will sing, and you can say it with me, hallelujah, what a savior.
[time=2790] Wow.
[time=2795] The house of the Lord in verse one will be established as the highest of the mountains.
[time=2799] Jesus comes and he says in Mark 14, that he's gonna build a temple not made with hands.
[time=2805] And that makes me very interested.
[time=2807] Verse two, that he may teach us his ways.
[time=2810] He insists in the gospel's friends again and again.
[time=2814] In Mark 138, for example, that his primary reason for coming is to teach.
[time=2819] All of his miracles only served to augment, to make clearer his teaching ministry.
[time=2827] That's why he performed the miracles.
[time=2829] So people would come to hear what he had to say.
[time=2833] The kingdom of God, he says in Mark one, is at hand.
[time=2837] It's very, very close.
[time=2838] Repent and believe in the gospel.
[time=2840] Verse three, beautiful phrase familiar to you.
[time=2844] Swords into plowshares, spears into pruning hooks.
[time=2848] Weapons of war made into garden tools.
[time=2853] There's a marvelous piece of sculpture called The Tree of Life that a friend of mine from Europe a couple of years ago showed me a picture of.
[time=2862] It's a picture of former child soldiers, weapons in an African conflict built into a giant tree.
[time=2869] And the sculpture was called The Tree of Life.
[time=2873] Broken weapons of war made into a sculpture
[time=2879] proclaiming the breakout of peace and the lives of these young boys who had been so, so damaged by warfare.
[time=2886] What a beautiful message.
[time=2887] Hannah Wile was in the first service and Hannah Wile is at the Air Force Academy.
[time=2893] Hannah Wile is learning to make war at the Air Force Academy.
[time=2897] Liz Posey is at West Point right now, learning to make war.
[time=2901] There are many others of our graduates from Blackout Christian School who are in basic training, who are learning to make war, your sons, your daughters.
[time=2909] And I'm glad that they are for our freedom.
[time=2911] We are right to be grateful to them.
[time=2915] And aren't you glad they will come a day when they won't have to learn to make war anymore?
[time=2921] That day will come and they'll beat their swords into plashers, Eden will return.
[time=2927] We begin the garden, we'll go back to the garden at the end.
[time=2932] The new Jerusalem and Revelation 21 guys is a garden-like city.
[time=2937] It's very beautiful.
[time=2938] Revelation 21 is where you see the description of the new Jerusalem and in that chapter, it describes a city made of precious stones.
[time=2945] Who would make a city of precious stones?
[time=2947] Why would you do that?
[time=2948] There's a message being sent and Isaiah picks up on it.
[time=2951] Hear me.
[time=2952] The message being sent is that that city will never be under threat.
[time=2956] Nobody will ever build siege towers against the new Jerusalem.
[time=2962] No more mourning, no crying, no death, no pain.
[time=2966] God will wipe every tear from their eyes.
[time=2969] Revelation 21.
[time=2972] There is a sense in which guys we're looking forward to that day in Micah chapter four and that Jesus gives us a glimpse of it ahead of time.
[time=2982] It's already, but not yet.
[time=2984] Moving on, so we have regard for the Lord here in the first five verses of Micah four, regard from the Lord.
[time=2992] Jump in with me to verse four of Micah four.
[time=2995] They'll sit every man in verse, vine and fig tree.
[time=2997] No one will make them afraid.
[time=3000] The mouth of Yahweh of armies.
[time=3002] The NLT says the Lord of heavens armies for Lord of hosts.
[time=3007] The NIB says Lord almighty.
[time=3009] It means Yahweh of armies.
[time=3012] He's spoken and when he speaks, we should listen.
[time=3017] All the peoples walk in the name of their God, but we'll walk in the name of our God, the Lord our God forever and ever.
[time=3023] Romans 10, 11, write that reference down if you would please in your bulletin.
[time=3026] Romans 10, 11 says this.
[time=3028] The scripture says everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.
[time=3034] That's a promise.
[time=3037] Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.
[time=3041] Isaiah 28 says whoever believes in him will never be in haste.
[time=3046] Will never be ashamed.
[time=3048] I was in Ann Arbor, Michigan yesterday at a football game.
[time=3052] If I place my hope and faith in 19 to 21 year old boys, I will be in haste.
[time=3059] I will be ashamed, hypothetically speaking of course.
[time=3063] Those who place their hope and their faith and their trust in him will never have any reason to be ashamed.
[time=3072] Never, that's a promise.
[time=3074] So friends, when Micah says in verse five of chapter four that will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever, he's encouraging us to do the same.
[time=3085] And when we do, no reason to be ashamed.
[time=3088] Verse six begins the second section here.
[time=3092] It's the reign of the Lord, the reign of the Lord.
[time=3095] Let her be in your outlines.
[time=3097] Look at verses six and seven.
[time=3098] In that day, declares the Lord, I will assemble the lame and gather those who have been driven away, those who might have afflicted.
[time=3106] The lame I will make the remnant and those who are cast off a strong nation and the Lord will reign over them in Mount Zion from this time forth and forever more.
[time=3118] Isaiah 35 says this in verse four.
[time=3122] Isaiah 35 verse four says, say to those who have an anxious heart, be strong, fear not, behold your God will come with vengeance.
[time=3132] With a recompense of God, he will come and save you.
[time=3135] Verse five, then the eyes of the blind shall be open.
[time=3139] The ears of the deaf, unstopped like a cork out of a bottle.
[time=3144] The lame man will leap like a deer, the tongue of the mute, sing for joy.
[time=3149] It just so happens in Jesus ministry, he begins by giving the lame strength to walk.
[time=3154] He begins by opening the eyes of the blind.
[time=3156] He begins by opening the ears of the deaf by giving the mute a song of joy.
[time=3162] It just so happens, that's the case.
[time=3164] God chooses the weak, the lame, and the foolish
[time=3170] to shame the strong.
[time=3171] First Corinthians one makes that case.
[time=3173] Consider you're calling not many of you were wise according to the worldly standards.
[time=3178] First Corinthians one 26.
[time=3180] Not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth, but God chose what is foolish in this world to shame the wise.
[time=3187] God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.
[time=3190] God chose what is low and despised in the world.
[time=3193] Even things that aren't to bring to nothing things that are.
[time=3197] So no one can boast in the presence of God.
[time=3200] The lame will be restored and given a place, given a refuge, given a name.
[time=3207] Look at the end of Micah 4, if you look at verse eight,
[time=3215] and you tower of the flock, "Hill the daughter of Zion, to you shall it come." The former dominions shall come kingship for the daughter of Jerusalem.
[time=3225] Jesus comes proclaiming the kingdom of God in the gospels.
[time=3228] The time is fulfilled.
[time=3230] God's kingdom is near, it's at hand, repent and believe in the gospel.
[time=3234] Kingship, verse nine.
[time=3236] Why do you cry aloud?
[time=3238] There's an oak king in you?
[time=3239] Has your counselor perished?
[time=3241] That pain has seized you like a woman in labor?
[time=3243] Rive and groan, oh daughter of Zion, like a woman labor.
[time=3246] From now you'll go out from the city and dwell in the open country to Babylon.
[time=3250] There you shall, let her save your outline, be rescued.
[time=3254] The rescue of the Lord.
[time=3257] Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.
[time=3260] Jerusalem will fall to the Babylonians in 586 BC.
[time=3265] A man named Cyrus, who Isaiah names by name, many years ahead of time.
[time=3272] Cyrus will let the Israelites go home in 536.
[time=3276] And the temple is rebuilt and the city is rebuilt with a man named Nehemiah.
[time=3280] The wall is rebuilt, the temple is eventually rebuilt and God keeps his promise.
[time=3285] You will be restored from the hand of your enemies.
[time=3288] I will do it.
[time=3289] I will give you a place.
[time=3292] Verse 12, these judging nations like Babylon and Assyria
[time=3299] don't know they're only carrying out the Lord's plans.
[time=3302] They think they're the kings, but they're actually the pawns.
[time=3306] And you can look at Isaiah 10 on that, that Assyria says, I'm gonna smash, smash, smash.
[time=3314] And God says, no, you're not, you're not gonna do that.
[time=3317] His heart doesn't sow in 10.
[time=3320] His heart thinks he's gonna build kingdoms for himself.
[time=3323] And God says, no, you won't do that king of Assyria.
[time=3325] In verse 13, in light of my brother, Steve Longbrake's comments earlier, arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion.
[time=3332] This is kind of like a threshing floor here in the stages, black surface here.
[time=3335] A threshing floor would be a place where the big oxen would be over on one side and drag behind the big piece of stone or something hard and heavy across a floor and the wheat would be separated out from the chaff on the threshing floor.
[time=3352] And so the picture here is of Israel doing that to its enemies.
[time=3356] Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, because I'll make your horn iron and the hubs of those oxen will be like bronze.
[time=3365] And you'll beat in pieces, many peoples, and will devote their gain to the Lord, their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.
[time=3373] The takeaway from that friends is this.
[time=3375] That God owns it all anyway.
[time=3378] And when I give back to him, I am only just recognizing his authority, his dominion, his sovereign power over all the things that I have.
[time=3389] So when I'm generous with my things, with my time, with my talent, with my treasure, I'm acknowledging that God, you are who you say you are, and everything you've given to me, you deserve it back.
[time=3399] And whatever measure you tell me to give it back.
[time=3401] Some things to put in your pocket and take away this morning.
[time=3406] God takes sin very seriously.
[time=3408] And thanks be to God, he's made provision for our sin in the person of his son.
[time=3415] We can enjoy us to know that we have a future and a hope in his name.
[time=3420] And we can know that when his reign comes and his rescue comes, as we have regard for him, they'll be faithful to his promises.
[time=3429] Pray with me.
[time=3430] There is no one like you, God.
[time=3436] All our hope is in you.
[time=3439] Thank you for your word today.
[time=3444] It's living and active and sharp and powerful.
[time=3446] There's nothing like it.
[time=3448] May we be obedient to it today, Father.
[time=3452] May we love what's good and hate what's evil.
[time=3456] May we do justice, love, mercy, and walk humbly before you today.
[time=3463] Recognizing that in you and in your name there is hope.
[time=3466] Thank you for the promise of a future.
[time=3470] Help us to be faithful to you in difficult times this week.
[time=3473] We ask all these things in Jesus' name.
