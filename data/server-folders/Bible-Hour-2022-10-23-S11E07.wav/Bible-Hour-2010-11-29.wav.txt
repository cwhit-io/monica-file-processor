[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It's great to be with you and good to get to spend this kind of time together.
[time=38] You know a Black Hawk, if you've watched this, if you know us at all, you know, we've got an enormous gratitude for the church, not just ours, but the big sea church, the kingdom of God moving forward in all kinds of settings with all kinds of different people and what a privilege for us here at Black Hawk to be a part of the church of Fort Wayne and this region and most of you know, some of you may not, but most of you know, my good friend, Pastor Jeff Carroll.
[time=68] Hey buddy.
[time=69] - Hey.
[time=69] - Good to be with you.
[time=70] Good to see you man.
[time=71] Jeff and I have been in ministry together going on about six, seven years and God has grown our friendship and he's been a part of the church in this region and in recent years has had the privilege of birthing and starting a brand new ministry called The Awakening and we always at Black Hawk want to do everything we can to support and encourage the church of Fort Wayne and Jeff.
[time=98] I'm so thankful for what God's doing at The Awakening, so grateful for our friendship and we just want everybody in our viewing audience to know about, first of all, tell them about how the awakening kind of began as far as the vision that God gave you for that kind of church and that part of Huntington.
[time=117] I've been in ministry for about 18 years and God just asked me to step out on faith, total faith, something that I probably have never done in ministry where you just start from scratch, nothing.
[time=129] I had walked in a building, it was a four-dealer ship and-- - A four-dealer ship.
[time=134] - A four-dealer ship.
[time=134] - A four-dealer ship and it was empty in Huntington and I went in and just shared the vision with the owner of that building and he bought into the vision.
[time=144] He's a Christian man, he bought into the vision and we worked out a deal where we could start the awakening at that location and we were so excited, it was 20,000 square feet and we were so excited and we started with just a handful of people that called me and said, you know, I want to be a part of something new and my vision was strictly for the Huntington community at that time, it was strictly for trying to make a difference, giving people hope, breaking cycles that have been so long in Huntington and we started that a little over a year ago and God has blessed us tremendously.
[time=182] Last year, we just finished our one year in October and we've seen 250 people come to know Christ in one year and 250 and God has blessed, come to faith.
[time=193] - Wow.
[time=194] - And God has blessed us so much so we're really excited to see what God's doing.
[time=197] - That's exciting.
[time=198] I've had the privilege of getting to speak at the awakening.
[time=202] I've had the privilege of getting to know those people.
[time=205] I can tell you from firsthand experience that there is a spirit in that place and a desire in those people to not only grow but to reach that community.
[time=215] And I know in some real special and unique ways God has given you and your team and that family some really special opportunities to reach out to that community, talk a little bit about some of what God's been doing on that front with you and the awakening family.
[time=232] - We have joined up with a lot of different churches in the area.
[time=236] One of the things that has just launched is our multi-house which is a homeless shelter for men.
[time=242] We started looking at different areas that have not been funded or not been tapped into and one of them was the multi-house.
[time=250] Men had nowhere to go.
[time=252] And so what we did was we a lady in our church had a vision for this and she come and talked to me about it from that vision.
[time=259] It was birthed.
[time=260] We opened it about a month ago and how did you get the funds through churches?
[time=268] There's a couple other churches that have come on board and we just started with the dream and money has been coming in now from different churches and different organizations.
[time=279] Right now we have about seven men there and we have plans for, we provide everything for them.
[time=285] They work during the day doing different projects within the community.
[time=289] The idea really came from Matthew Barnett at the Dream Center when I went out there last year and 20 of our people went out there and just seeing what you can do when you just go out and lend a hand to people and how God is just blessed and all that.
[time=304] - So a home called the multi-house.
[time=306] Homeless men in your community, finding a place where they can be loved and cared for, educated, it's amazing.
[time=314] We're getting ready to celebrate recovery in our home.
[time=318] The people are gonna come and help us with that.
[time=320] So every aspect, trying to get them to the next level and trying to get them to where God would have them be in the future.
[time=327] - That's cool.
[time=328] Well, I know as many of you watch and listen to this, our hope is that you would be not only encouraged by what God is doing in the church of Fort Wayne and this region, but you may be in the Huntington area.
[time=340] You may be Southwest Fort Wayne.
[time=343] You may be anywhere and God may just be kind of encouraging you as you hear Jeff and you hear him talk about and articulate the vision and the dreams that they have at the awakening.
[time=354] We've got information about the awakening here on the bottom of the screen.
[time=358] You can go to their website, you can call their office.
[time=362] If you have any questions at all, I know Jeff would be more than happy to talk with you about it.
[time=367] Jeff, just real quick as we close.
[time=369] If someone, and there may be many today watching who as they hear you, they think, okay, bottom line it for me, Jeff, what is at the heartbeat of the awakening?
[time=381] A lot of people want to know before they'll go and check a place out.
[time=385] I mean, what are they really about?
[time=387] What are they really trying to pursue?
[time=390] Talk to the people and just let them know.
[time=392] - All right.
[time=393] You know, there is two greats in the Bible that God gave us, the great commandment and the great commission.
[time=400] And we're all about loving people from every walk of life that is walking in our door right now, not seeing their traditional church building.
[time=408] They're just walking in an old Ford dealership and they're coming in and we're trying to love on them, but also give them hope, give them truth that will transform their life.
[time=418] We have every walk of life, every denomination represented in our congregation right now.
[time=424] So if you're out there and you're sitting there this morning and you're just looking and you've been searching for hope, I just invite you, if you're in the Huntington area or the surrounding area, I just invite you to come in at 10 o'clock on Sunday morning and you're gonna receive love, you're gonna receive a message of hope, but then also you're gonna get a chance to transform your life, what only Jesus Christ can do.
[time=449] So I invite you to come.
[time=450] Thank you so much for just Black Hawk for giving us this opportunity.
[time=456] Absolutely, and that's why I love him so much.
[time=459] I love him because I know he's passionate about the truth and he wants desperately to be a blessing to those that God brings across his path and the awakening a great opportunity.
[time=470] So Jeff, thank you for coming.
[time=473] We love you and thank you as well.
[time=475] As always, thanks for tuning in and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=479] God bless you.
[time=483] How long, O Lord, will you forget me forever?
[time=487] How long will you hide your face from me?
[time=489] How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and every day have sorrow in my heart?
[time=496] How long will my enemies triumph over me?
[time=499] I call to you, O God, for you will hear me.
[time=502] Give ear to me, Lord, and hear my prayer.
[time=506] Lord, your people are waiting.
[time=508] For centuries we have been waiting.
[time=511] We remember the law you gave your servant Moses.
[time=513] We have heeded the words of the prophets.
[time=516] Lord, we have treasured the Psalms.
[time=518] Oh, God, my God, I know that you're anointed when the Christ, he is coming.
[time=524] He will come and establish a kingdom and he will rule forever.
[time=529] Kings will come to pay tribute to him.
[time=531] My Lord, the Messiah, your Son, Emmanuel, still we wait.
[time=537] We are your humble servants, O God, what then shall we do?
[time=541] [MUSIC - 39 seconds]
[time=594] Lord, some say the Messiah will be born in fanfare, born of nobility.
[time=599] He will have riches, wealth, and influence beyond imagination.
[time=603] Others say your anointed one will be a warrior, born ready to fight for your chosen people.
[time=608] And still others say we should expect a savior to rescue us from poverty and oppression and lead us in rebellion against this government.
[time=616] I say you'll give us freedom, O God.
[time=618] What Lord do you say?
[time=622] [MUSIC - 34 seconds]
[time=664] - I trust in you, God, with all my heart.
[time=672] I cannot lean on my own understanding.
[time=674] - You have said I will send my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way.
[time=680] A voice of one, calling in the desert.
[time=682] Prepare a way for the Lord.
[time=684] Make straight paths for him.
[time=685] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=740] (gentle music) - Well, good morning, everybody.
[time=758] It's sure good to see all of you.
[time=761] Hey, open your Bibles, if you would, to Micah.
[time=766] We're gonna jump back into our study of the book of Micah, who is a God like you?
[time=770] We come this morning to Micah, chapter five, verses one through the first part of five.
[time=777] If you would please in honor of God's word, would you stand?
[time=781] And let me read this to you this morning.
[time=785] Micah, chapter five, verse one.
[time=787] Now, muster your troops, so daughter of troops, siege is laid against us.
[time=794] The rod, they will smite the judge of Israel on the cheek, but as for you Bethlehem, Ephrithah, too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you, one will go forth for me to be ruler in Israel.
[time=809] His goings forth are from long ago, from the days of eternity.
[time=814] Verse three, therefore, he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has given birth, then the rest of his brothers shall return to the people of Israel.
[time=827] And he will arise and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God, and they will remain because at that time he will be great to the ends of the earth.
[time=842] This one, this one who comes will be our, what say it, our peace.
[time=849] Our Father in heaven, we stand before you this morning, again, as a people expectantly awaiting what is such a gift and privilege, God, to be able to receive your word, instruction from the scriptures.
[time=866] God, this life-changing truth that we get to take in and wrestle with and chew on and apply, and Father, we're grateful this morning.
[time=874] We want you to know that.
[time=876] God, I pray that for those in the room this morning who stand here, for those who watch, via the broadcast, for those who are listening online, God, I pray that you would grant the courage and the obedience and the faithfulness, God, that we'll need to respond to what you've given us here today.
[time=897] We pray, God, that we would be doers of the word.
[time=901] We're thankful for it, God.
[time=902] We're thankful for the privilege of gathering.
[time=905] It is here in the gathering that we encounter you.
[time=908] We have already, and we long to even more so, God, as we open up the Word of God, may it change us and may it envision us, may it embolden us for all that you've called to each of us to do and be a part of, we pray, in your son's name.
[time=925] Amen, you can be seated.
[time=928] You know, one of the clear and dominant themes, most of you in the room, I think, would understand this.
[time=935] One of the clear and dominant themes of the Old Testament that is really very clear to anyone who takes the time to read it and study it and experience it is, God's unique, tumultuous, and intimate relationship with the people of Israel.
[time=953] Raise your hand if that sounds somewhat familiar.
[time=955] All right, God's unique, tumultuous, and intimate relationship with the people of Israel.
[time=962] You see, here's how it goes.
[time=963] God chose to establish a covenant relationship with Israel through Abraham.
[time=969] They will be his people, and he will be their God.
[time=975] He says they will, Israel will be redeemed.
[time=978] Israel will be redeemed, God said, through their relationship with him, and that he wanted to, he desired to work through Israel.
[time=988] God, in his scriptures, lays out, but his desire and design is to work through Israel to reach and impact a lost and broken world.
[time=998] He wants to use Israel to bring redemption to the other nations.
[time=1004] You see, long before Paul wrote to the New Testament church, be in the world, but not what?
[time=1013] But not of it.
[time=1014] Long before Paul ever wrote that, we see that as God's design and God's plan and God's heart with the people of Israel.
[time=1023] His desire has always been that his people would be in, but not of, radically impacting the nations as they faithfully live out their faith and their love for him.
[time=1037] He rescues them, God does, from Egypt through Moses.
[time=1042] He leads them to the promised land eventually through Joshua.
[time=1047] He reminds them, he pleads with them and continues to envision them through the prophets, pleading with them to be a faithful, to be a faithful people so that he can use them to do what God has always been about.
[time=1063] That is to heal, restore and reach out to a lost and hurting world.
[time=1070] God's always been about that.
[time=1072] God's still about that.
[time=1075] It's always been his heart that his redemptive people would be used by him to reach out to heal and restore a lost and hurting world.
[time=1084] But long story short, long story short, how does real do?
[time=1090] Not so good.
[time=1093] They didn't.
[time=1096] They didn't reach.
[time=1100] They didn't impact a lost and hurting world for the kingdom of their God.
[time=1105] No, they were not faithful.
[time=1107] They were unfaithful.
[time=1110] They were distracted.
[time=1112] They were stiff-necked.
[time=1115] A grandpa used to always say, rebellious.
[time=1118] They were ungrateful and they were adulterous.
[time=1123] And finally, God says enough.
[time=1127] You'd just never want to hear God say that to you, would you?
[time=1132] Enough.
[time=1133] Enough of you.
[time=1135] God moves on to a new redemptive plan.
[time=1143] God moves on to a new redemptive people called, not the nation of Israel, but the church.
[time=1150] We see in the New Testament church age, Israel gets set aside, if you will.
[time=1158] And in Israel's getting set aside and God moving his redemptive efforts to the church, which now included the Gentiles.
[time=1167] And as he gives vision to the church, to impact the lost and hurting world, it has left many, many people over the years.
[time=1174] And I myself, as I've understood these things a little more clearly over the years, have wondered.
[time=1181] So, okay, we understand that about the church and your new redemptive plan and your new redemptive people.
[time=1186] But what about Israel?
[time=1189] What about the Jews?
[time=1193] God, what about the promise you made to them?
[time=1200] Remember, he entered into a covenant relationship with them and he said, "You'll be my people and I will be your God." Is God finished with Israel?
[time=1209] Is there any hope for his people in Christ?
[time=1214] Now, what we have to understand about Micah, here we come back to Micah.
[time=1217] What you gotta understand about Micah is that he, Micah, like most prophets, was deeply concerned by this very question about Israel's future.
[time=1226] Especially in view of Israel's sin and the judgment Micah as a prophet knew was coming.
[time=1235] Remember Micah, as Steven and I have told you in recent weeks, Micah speaks and writes with the knowledge, with the full knowledge, a word from God to the people.
[time=1244] He writes and speaks with the full knowledge of oncoming Assyrian invasion and the subsequent captivity of God's people.
[time=1255] Micah knows this is coming.
[time=1258] God's people are going to be judged.
[time=1259] God is going to allow the invasion of the Assyrian nation and the subsequent captivity of God's people.
[time=1268] A lot more to say there, but I just, let me stop just for a second.
[time=1277] Just a little sidebar, okay?
[time=1280] Related, but just a little side note on that.
[time=1286] I want you to think about those words.
[time=1288] I wonder what comes to your mind.
[time=1291] Invasion and captivity.
[time=1295] God was going to discipline.
[time=1300] God was going to judge his people.
[time=1302] A people who were designed by God to be different.
[time=1306] A people who were designed by God to make a difference in their world because of their uncompromising obedience and their faithfulness to God.
[time=1315] God in this day would allow judgment and discipline to come and he would allow it to come as the enemy.
[time=1324] You're listening.
[time=1327] As the enemy would invade and through the invasion take captive God's people.
[time=1334] I was talking to a friend early in the week
[time=1341] and it just got me thinking about this.
[time=1344] They said to me, aren't you glad?
[time=1346] He doesn't do that anymore.
[time=1348] And I almost said, yeah.
[time=1354] And then I thought, wait a minute.
[time=1357] I think he's still doing it.
[time=1362] You ever thought this?
[time=1365] I hadn't really until I started thinking about it this week.
[time=1368] Invasion and captivity.
[time=1371] And I know what my friend meant.
[time=1374] My friend meant, he's so glad that foreign armies don't come and take over our town and destroy our buildings and knock down our worship centers and take believers who were supposed to be making a difference and put them in dungeon prisons and foreign dignitaries lands, right?
[time=1391] But I just thought about it and chewed on it and just felt like it was worth saying to you.
[time=1401] I think it's still going on.
[time=1403] I think the enemy is still invading.
[time=1405] I think the enemy is bent on distracting
[time=1412] and nullifying the mission of God's people as he's ever been.
[time=1418] And I don't think any army's gonna come marching into Fort Wayne this week.
[time=1424] But oh, don't be mistaken.
[time=1425] The enemy is on the move.
[time=1428] The invasion is ever-present.
[time=1431] And there are today children of God who find themselves behind what?
[time=1440] Bars, captive, chains out of the game.
[time=1445] Now I'm making a difference in the world.
[time=1451] And I'll go a little further.
[time=1454] Sorry, a little rabbit trail here, but again, somewhat connected.
[time=1457] Let me just remind you how Babylon and how Assyria went about invading.
[time=1466] Yes, they came in full force.
[time=1467] Yes, there was massive destruction, but here's the strategic thing that they did when the enemy invaded God's people and captives were taken.
[time=1479] And all I gotta do is take it at Daniel to show you this.
[time=1484] They took the young men.
[time=1490] They took the sharpest, brightest, most hopeful young minds who had been fed and taught the great truths of God.
[time=1500] And when invasion took place in this day, one thing they did all the time was they took the young ones away.
[time=1507] And they isolated young ones in palaces, in prisons, thousands of miles away and they wiped their minds and their hearts, they tried to wipe their minds and their hearts clean with a new message.
[time=1521] And I just wanna plead with you and I wanna remind each and every one of us, 'cause I'm in this with you, to be careful with your young ones, to understand that the tactic of the enemy has not changed a bit.
[time=1539] And while he's after you and me guaranteed, he wants desperately to take them away, to isolate them from you and from what is true and right and good and feed them an absolute lie, to begin to wipe from their minds and hearts that, which is true, and it happens in entertainment, it happens in music, it happens on the web, it happens everywhere they go.
[time=1563] And so I wanna just remind you, and I know this might sound weary some, I know this might sound tiresome, I know this might mean extra effort, but everywhere they go, you should be there to the degree that you can, to the point that it's possible you and I should be by their side, investing in them, loving them, guiding them in the context of relationship, not yelling from the recliner, but walking with them through life, amen?
[time=1599] Just a reminder.
[time=1600] So back to Micah 5.
[time=1603] Back to Micah 5, so what will happen to Israel and how is this related to us?
[time=1610] Hang on, here we go.
[time=1611] Verse three, look at verse three, therefore what's gonna happen to Israel?
[time=1615] It's on Micah's heart, it was on every prophet's heart.
[time=1618] They were Israelites, they knew the promises of God.
[time=1621] Therefore, verse three, therefore he, God, shall give them Israel under God's judgment, shall give them up, therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has given birth, referring to the time of the coming of Messiah.
[time=1640] Then the rest of his brothers, there's Israel, shall return to the people of Israel.
[time=1645] Typically prophets, one commentator noted our vague about timing, here it is true.
[time=1651] Then the rest of his brothers will return.
[time=1654] He doesn't tell us when.
[time=1657] The text indicates that it's after the Messiah comes and it's connected with his coming, but when he doesn't specifically say, he just knows this, the Messiah is coming and his coming will mean at some point in time, some great in gathering, some great reconnecting, if you will, of Israel.
[time=1676] That's what Paul sees in the prophets as he teaches in Romans 11.
[time=1684] Turn there if you would.
[time=1684] Go to Romans, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts.
[time=1688] Go to Romans 11, 25.
[time=1692] This is a whole series we could do on these few verses, but we'll just give it a few minutes.
[time=1697] Let me just remind you of what Paul teaches the church at Rome about Israel.
[time=1702] Romans 11, 25, "For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery, so that you will not be wise in your own estimation, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, partial hardening of Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles, until all the Gentiles that are going to be saved are saved, and we don't know how many that is, and we don't know when that is, but when that occurs, and so the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, and so all Israel then will be saved, just as it is written, the deliverer will come from Zion.
[time=1752] He will remove ungodliness from Jacob, from Israel.
[time=1757] This is my, there it is, this is my covenant with them.
[time=1761] God keeps his, what, say it, his promises.
[time=1765] This is my covenant with them, when I take away their sins.
[time=1771] From the standpoint of the gospel, Paul writes to the Gentiles at Rome, they, Israel, are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of God's choice, they are beloved for the sake of the fathers, for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable, unchangeable.
[time=1792] For just as you, Gentile Rome, for just as you were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience, because of Israel's hardheartedness, the gospel came to the Gentiles just because you, he says, were given mercy.
[time=1811] So these also, 31, so these also now, Israel,
[time=1817] have been disobedient that because of the mercy shown to you, they also may be now shown mercy.
[time=1823] For God has shut up all in disobedience so that he may show mercy to all.
[time=1832] For a season there is hardness on Israel and they are unresponsive, but the day is coming when the hardness will be taken away and all Israel will be grafted into the tree of true redeemed believers, true redeemed Israel.
[time=1848] That is into Christ.
[time=1850] So it's good news.
[time=1851] At the end of the day, God will again grant Israel
[time=1857] a chance to confess Messiah as King.
[time=1861] Make no mistake, nobody gets in 'cause they were born somewhere, but he gives them again the opportunity.
[time=1868] As truth has been revealed to come to faith in Jesus Christ and what a day that will be.
[time=1875] Good news for Israel, no doubt, but great news as well for the Gentile, for many of you and myself in the room this morning.
[time=1883] And I want us to be able to celebrate and at Thanksgiving, how was your Thanksgiving?
[time=1888] Good, mine too.
[time=1891] And at Thanksgiving be thankful for the person and work of Christ, which Micah speaks to, the person and work of Christ that ultimately has the power to keep, listen, to keep invasion at bay and to set captives, what, free?
[time=1908] Micah, Micah's prophecy, write this down, number one.
[time=1912] First thing I want us to look out here, Micah's prophetic word is fulfilled in the person of Christ.
[time=1918] Will you write that down?
[time=1919] Micah's prophetic word is fulfilled in the person of Christ.
[time=1924] Let's make sure right out of the gate here.
[time=1927] First of all, we see the coming together.
[time=1929] I want you to see the inner weaving of what Micah prophesies and Micah five and what takes place at the nativity, what takes place in the coming of Christ.
[time=1941] Micah's prophecy, the person of Christ, how they come together.
[time=1944] Go to Matthew two, if you will.
[time=1946] Matthew chapter two, verses one to six, you'll see it on the screen.
[time=1950] Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he who has been born king of the Jews, "for we saw his star when it rose "and have come to worship him?" It goes on in verse three to say, "When Herod the king heard this, "he was troubled and all of Jerusalem "troubled with him," it says, "and assembling all the chief priests "and scribes of the people." He gets the leadership to all gather around.
[time=1987] He inquires of them where the Christ was to be born and all the leaders of Israel said with one voice, they told him in where, say it, Bethlehem, they knew it.
[time=2002] They had known it from the beginning.
[time=2007] In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet whose name was Micah.
[time=2015] And you, O Bethlehem in the land of Judah,
[time=2023] are by no means the least.
[time=2026] He says there in Matthew two, six, no means least among the rulers of Judah, for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people.
[time=2033] The leadership among the Jews, Sadducee, scribes and Pharisees, the smartest and brightest of men, all knew exactly where and when the Messiah was to be born.
[time=2044] They all knew Micah had declared and announced it, but not only did the leaders know it, watch this, the people knew it as well.
[time=2051] Look at John 742, has not, here is a passage in John 7 where the people are responding, has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from the offspring of David and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was, the people knew this, the leadership knew this, everyone in Israel knew this.
[time=2074] And it boggles my mind sometimes when I think about it because they all knew it and they all missed it.
[time=2084] Here's redemption, here's hope, here's freedom and blessing right in front of you.
[time=2092] Sometimes I'm sure God's saying that to you and me, I'm sure He was saying it to them.
[time=2099] And I want to just remind you this morning, can I just say this to you?
[time=2102] I know many of you.
[time=2105] I know some of what you walk through daily.
[time=2107] I don't know others of you, but look forward to getting to know you hopefully in the days to come.
[time=2113] But let me just say this to everyone of you in the room, especially at this time of year, pay attention.
[time=2120] I don't say this lovingly, I'm not saying it sarcastically, open your eyes to what has come.
[time=2129] Don't miss what is before you.
[time=2135] I wonder what's right in front of you.
[time=2141] I know, I know what's right in front of you that could offer you salvation.
[time=2146] I know what's right in front of you that could offer you freedom.
[time=2150] I know what's right in front of you that could rescue you from what you live with and face on a daily basis.
[time=2158] My friends, you could hit a foreiron to Bethlehem from Jerusalem.
[time=2164] They'd be for you a driver, me a foreiron.
[time=2170] But either way, you with me?
[time=2172] It was really, it was just down the trail.
[time=2176] And they missed him.
[time=2178] I don't want you to miss him.
[time=2183] I don't want you to keep living hopelessly.
[time=2188] I don't want you to keep living in the midst of the turmoil and strife and guilt and shame and questions that you continue to live in day after day.
[time=2199] I don't want you to miss him.
[time=2202] Your marriage is in trouble.
[time=2203] Your addictions are just killing you.
[time=2207] Spiritually, you feel empty.
[time=2211] And I want to just proclaim to you this morning what Micah proclaims and speaks to and what the nativity story relates.
[time=2220] He has come and he is here for you.
[time=2225] Amen?
[time=2227] Don't want you to miss it.
[time=2229] What does Micah tell us about the Messiah?
[time=2235] Write this down, would you?
[time=2236] This is so important.
[time=2237] The importance of insignificant Bethlehem's significant offspring.
[time=2244] Write that down.
[time=2246] The importance of insignificant Bethlehem's significant offspring.
[time=2251] I just read it to you a moment ago, but it's for you Bethlehem Micah 5'2.
[time=2256] But it's for you Bethlehem Ephrathah who are too little to be among the clans of Judah.
[time=2262] From you shall come forth for me, one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from old, from ancient days.
[time=2272] You see that Micah 5'2.
[time=2275] From the days of eternity.
[time=2279] Was reading this week and one commentator said it like this.
[time=2283] He said Bethlehem was hardly worth counting among the clans of Judah, yet God chooses to bring his magnificent Messiah out of this little tiny unknown town.
[time=2295] Why?
[time=2296] One answer is that Messiah was to be according to the scriptures of the lineage of David, right?
[time=2303] Messiah was to come from the line of David and David was from Bethlehem.
[time=2308] And while that's true and worth noting, this commentator says it really misses the point of verse two.
[time=2316] The point of verse two is this.
[time=2318] Here's the point of verse two.
[time=2320] Here's maybe the point of the message.
[time=2322] Here's maybe the point that you ought to make sure you walk away with today.
[time=2325] Here's the deal.
[time=2326] Bethlehem was small.
[time=2330] Bethlehem was nothing.
[time=2336] Bethlehem was in the shadow of.
[time=2343] Bethlehem was insignificant.
[time=2345] Bethlehem was gas city.
[time=2351] Sorry.
[time=2355] I used to always pick on gas city.
[time=2358] There, I forget the first time, 15 years ago, I came driving up to Fort Wayne from India in the airport and there's a water tower with gas city.
[time=2365] I thought, wow, I'm not in Kansas anymore.
[time=2370] It's just, it's just nothing.
[time=2373] It's just nothing.
[time=2375] It's just little, small.
[time=2377] It's not that it's great because David was born there.
[time=2382] No, God chooses something small, quiet out of the way, on the fringe.
[time=2389] He does something there in small, insignificant Bethlehem that changes the course of human history and all of eternity, this commentator goes on and says, why is so significant?
[time=2402] Why is this such a big deal?
[time=2404] Because when God acts this way, we can't boast in the merits or achievements of men, but only in the glorious mercy of God.
[time=2412] We can't say, well, of course he said his favor on Bethlehem.
[time=2415] Look at the human glory Bethlehem has achieved.
[time=2419] All we can say is, wow, God is, God is other.
[time=2428] I guess he's not impressed by bigness.
[time=2431] He does nothing in order to attract attention to our accomplishments.
[time=2437] He does everything to magnify his, his glorious grace and mercy that brought something, in this case, everything, Messiah, out of nothing.
[time=2446] The Apostle Paul speaks to it in 1 Corinthians 1.
[time=2453] You can turn there in your New Testament's 1 Corinthians 1 verses 27 is where we'll begin.
[time=2460] God chose what is, listen church.
[time=2463] God chose what is foolish.
[time=2465] Here he isn't talking about Bethlehem.
[time=2467] I mean, there's implications, but now he's talking about you and me.
[time=2471] God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise.
[time=2476] God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.
[time=2480] God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not.
[time=2486] To bring things that are so that no human being
[time=2494] might boast in the presence of God.
[time=2496] And if you're gonna boast, Paul says, let him who boasts, boast in the who, in the Lord.
[time=2503] There's a quote that'll be on the screen.
[time=2507] I love the heart and the spirit of it.
[time=2509] God chose a stable, so no innkeeper could boast.
[time=2513] He chose the comfort of my inn.
[time=2515] God chose a manger so that no woodworker could boast.
[time=2519] He chose the craftsmanship of my bed.
[time=2522] He chose Bethlehem, my friends, so no one could boast.
[time=2525] The greatness of our city constrained the divine choice and he chose you and me freely and unconditionally to stop the mouth of all human boasting because you and I, we're nothing.
[time=2541] Because we're weak.
[time=2543] Anybody in the room agree with that?
[time=2545] Anybody in the room feel like bottom line when it all gets said and done, you're just despised, you're low, you're weak, you fall down, it's hard to stand.
[time=2554] Anybody in the room feel fearful?
[time=2556] Of course you do.
[time=2558] And I love what it says there in 1 Corinthians 1.
[time=2562] It says he chose the foolish, the weak, the low, the despised, even things that are not.
[time=2571] Even those in the room who would say I'm even below, I'm below weak and despised, he'd say you too.
[time=2577] You're exactly, and this is where you should find encouragement today, you are exactly what I'm looking for.
[time=2584] From little insignificant Bethlehem comes greatness.
[time=2588] My friend, let me just tell you this, stay low.
[time=2592] Stay humble, stay insignificant, stay lowly,
[time=2600] stay behind the scenes, be faithful, bring attention to him, not you, from your lowliness and from your faithfulness, from your humility comes greatness, not yours, but his, a great truth for you and I to remember today.
[time=2622] Number three, write this down, the promise of Messiah confirms the promises of God.
[time=2628] Wish I had a lot of time here, I don't, I'm gonna give you a quick, as I read this week, I just wanna give you a quick little lesson in Jewish culture.
[time=2637] Second thing Micah shows us about Jesus the Messiah, he makes clear Micah does, that Messiah secures for us the promises of God, Christ is the yes
[time=2651] of all God's promises.
[time=2653] So if you trust Christ, you will inherit the promises of God, now how does Micah show us?
[time=2662] How does Micah show that Messiah confirms the promises of God?
[time=2668] I'm gonna just say it to you this way quickly, any Jew in those days that would read or hear Micah's message, any of them who would hear the words here of Micah five, when he would hear Micah talking about, listen, a coming ruler out of Bethlehem who would feed his flock in the strength of the Lord would immediately think of two people, King David and Jesus.
[time=2694] King David and the Messiah, a few links here between the two.
[time=2699] David was from Bethlehem, you see that in the text, it's called the city of David.
[time=2704] David was a ruler in Israel, you see ruler in the text, he was probably the greatest ruler Israel ever knew.
[time=2710] And thirdly, David was a shepherd, as a boy, and later called the shepherd of Israel, the point that Micah makes with the link to David is this, my friends, don't miss this.
[time=2720] Micah is reasserting, and any Jew reading it would know it, the certainty of God's promise to David, of a Messiah.
[time=2728] Second Samuel seven, second Samuel seven, 12.
[time=2734] God promised David, I will raise up your offspring after you who shall come forth from your body, your line, and I will establish his kingdom.
[time=2745] He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever, and your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me, your throne shall be established forever.
[time=2759] God promised David, the people knew it,
[time=2765] and here comes Micah, as he talks about the Messiah, it confirms the promises of God.
[time=2770] You know the amazing thing to keep in mind here about Micah, is that he reasserts the certainty of this promise, of a kingdom that will reign forever, not at a time when Israel is rising to power, but at a time when Israel, as we've been telling you for the last few weeks, they're on the brink of destruction.
[time=2792] This thing is caving in all around him, and here's the prophet's voice, basically saying at the bleakest, darkest hour, God is delivering a message of hope.
[time=2807] And I'm just convinced that to somebody
[time=2813] in the room this morning who needed to hear that, that there are those among the people of God here in this room today who needed to be reminded of the fact that oftentimes at the bleakest, darkest hour when the walls are caving in, here's a message from the prophet saying, "You know what, there will be a better day." And there may be a season of difficulty, but there will be a day of victory where the Lord will reign and he will reign with his people forever and ever.
[time=2844] Here's the point, the coming of Christ was the confirmation of the promises of God.
[time=2852] Paul says in Romans 15, eight, Christ, this is so clear, Christ became a servant to the circumcised, who's that, the Jews, to show God's truthfulness in order to confirm the promise given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs.
[time=2873] All the promises of God, 2 Corinthians 1, find their yes in him.
[time=2881] So if you are in Christ, listen, so if you are in Christ by faith, you are the recipient of all every one of God's promises.
[time=2890] His promise for blessing, his promise for peace, his promise for salvation, his promise for comfort, his promise for eternity.
[time=2898] The promise of Messiah confirms the promises of God.
[time=2905] Lastly, we'll close with this.
[time=2908] You see it there on your screen, the promise of Messiah brings both protection and peace to his people.
[time=2914] I hope that encourages you today.
[time=2916] Here's the message of Micah 5-4, and he shall stand, it says, and he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord is God, and they shall his people.
[time=2935] They shall dwell secure.
[time=2937] For now he shall be great to the ends of the earth, and he shall be their peace.
[time=2945] I want you to see just quickly what we find in Christ, what we find in the promised Messiah.
[time=2953] Yeah, you can just kind of make a note as we go.
[time=2955] First he stands, you see it there in the text?
[time=2959] First he stands and he shall stand and shepherd his flock.
[time=2963] I make note of the word stand because there would be some shepherds that might kick back.
[time=2968] There might be some shepherds who would lean up against a rock with some grass in their mouth, wondering how it's going out in the pasture, around the bend where they've lost sight of the sheep.
[time=2979] You with me?
[time=2980] The word stand in the Hebrew is a word that brings with it alertness.
[time=2985] Do you understand that you have a shepherd who as it relates to you, and your safety, and your direction, he is alert, he stands, he doesn't sit, he's on his toes, he's not laying down, he's aware.
[time=3001] And he prods and he pushes and he leads and he guides and he's able to do so because he is upright as they say.
[time=3011] Second he shepherds, it says there in the text that he stands and shepherds his flock, it's worth noting he doesn't leave us to find our own food.
[time=3019] Your Lord and mine doesn't leave us to find our own water, we're not left to find our own shelter, we're not left to find our own direction.
[time=3028] He leads us, the scriptures teach in green pastures and besides still waters.
[time=3034] There will be no, never has been, there never will be any unmet need in him, amen?
[time=3042] I love this one.
[time=3046] I love this third point, as you see it right there in the text he shall stand and shepherd his flock.
[time=3052] Listen, in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord, his God, he will serve you.
[time=3063] He serves this in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord is God.
[time=3069] His efforts, listen, his efforts for us will not be hindered by lack of strength.
[time=3077] The strength of the Lord, you learn as you look at that word, the strength of the Lord is omnipotent, you understand that right?
[time=3085] The strength of the Lord is omnipotent, it never ends.
[time=3090] It's always there, it's unbending, it's unshakable, it's supremely and eternally strong.
[time=3099] Therefore, if you are trusting in Christ, omnipotent strength, strength that can't be beaten, strength that can't be weakened, strength that can never fail is on your side.
[time=3112] He serves us in the strength of the Lord, the day Deborah, my wife, my wife of 23 years, as of next week, said to me, I would think after 23 years, she'd stop saying this to me, but I think sometimes she just wants to kind of make me feel good or able in this one arena.
[time=3131] Most of you know me, you know this is kind of a joke.
[time=3133] She says to me, hey, the fireplace, our fireplace at our house has got these, it's got this fan unit kind of underneath it, and on the sides there's these two fans and you flip this switch on the wall and when you get a fire going, the fans blow out the hot air.
[time=3150] You're amazed, I know, by my ability to describe these technical functions.
[time=3154] (audience laughing) So she's home by herself the day, she flips that switch and there's this like flash and like no fans.
[time=3162] So I don't know why in the world she'd ever say this, but she said, hey, think you could take a look at the fans.
[time=3168] Which if you know me, it's just a moment about her terror and fear.
[time=3173] 'Cause I don't know anything about the fans and yet I think she's just trying to give me a shot at it.
[time=3178] So you know me, I go to the cupboard and I get my Tupperware toolbox, I still got it.
[time=3182] Been talking about my Tupperware toolbox for years, nobody's bought me a new one yet, don't, I won't use it.
[time=3191] I go get my Tupperware toolbox and I, you know, there's no like handles on it so I'm just kind of carrying it, right?
[time=3198] And I'm walking to the living room with my Tupperware toolbox and zero idea of what I'm even gonna do when I get there.
[time=3206] And my point in saying that is this, I don't think that instilled much confidence in her.
[time=3212] I know a few of my kids snickered and ran to their room and I just wanna tell you it's different with him.
[time=3220] Unnipotent strength, unbelievable capacity.
[time=3230] To do anything needed.
[time=3233] He is other and he is yours.
[time=3238] And he stands and he shepherds and he serves you in strength and look at that last thing there, verse five.
[time=3246] Finally, he will be our, what?
[time=3250] Peace.
[time=3251] He will be our peace.
[time=3253] And yes, in the context here it talks, peace does refer to earthly, political peace.
[time=3261] That's true but I love how one commentator said it.
[time=3264] He said, yes, there shall be a peace for all of mankind.
[time=3273] One day the ruler, the king of kings, the Lord of lords will return and make that a reality.
[time=3278] But before there can be peace on earth, there must be peace between us and God.
[time=3287] Our unbelief and his wrath must be removed.
[time=3291] That is our deepest peace and our deepest need at this time of year.
[time=3298] Would you stand and just quietly bow your heads?
[time=3302] And I wanna just ask you as you stand and as you bow your heads if there's anybody at all in the room, anybody watching on the broadcast, I wanna just give you a chance to write there in your place in this room, this morning, wherever you are watching, you may be sensing today in this moment your need for ultimate final peace, peace not earthly but peace personally between you and him.
[time=3326] You know that your sin has separated you from God.
[time=3331] And now you're beginning to understand this great truth that God and his love for you gives his son, Messiah comes and accomplishes everything he was designed to accomplish.
[time=3341] He dies as a substitute for your sin.
[time=3345] And in that substitution gives you forgiveness and redemption and life and blessing if you'll receive it.
[time=3353] What a time of year to receive a gift.
[time=3358] And I wanna just say it to you this morning, whoever you might be, whatever your road has looked like.
[time=3363] If these words are running through your heart and mind today, if these words can be communicated from you to him he hears you words like this, so Father in heaven forgive me for my sin.
[time=3376] I long to be close to you not separated from you and God in heaven I'm thankful for your son, Messiah, who came and provides for me this way to you and God today I wanna come to you.
[time=3391] I wanna fully surrender my heart and life.
[time=3394] And not only that I wanna live for you.
[time=3397] I wanna live in the light and not in the darkness.
[time=3401] I long for this shepherd who stands and shepherds and serves me with strength.
[time=3406] I come to you Father in humility just like your son came
[time=3412] and I commit my life to you.
[time=3414] And Father in heaven for those of us who have been at that place
[time=3425] and cried out to you in that way, whether we walked an aisle or prayed a prayer or sat with a friend or fell to our knees in our rooms, doesn't matter God there are those of us in the room who have experienced the joy of being redeemed.
[time=3442] And for those who prayed that prayer this morning, for those who are moving in that direction today, we rejoice with them, for them.
[time=3453] We pray God you'd give us as a church the strength to walk alongside and encourage them in the days to come.
[time=3459] Father we look forward to these next weeks of advent as we look forward to the birth of your son and all that that means and brings prepare us as a people, prepare a way for us to celebrate that in new rich and meaningful ways.
[time=3477] Thank you for the great truth of Micah.
[time=3479] Thank you for what we've been reminded of today and all the people in the room agreed and said amen.
[time=3485] (upbeat music)
[time=3545] You
