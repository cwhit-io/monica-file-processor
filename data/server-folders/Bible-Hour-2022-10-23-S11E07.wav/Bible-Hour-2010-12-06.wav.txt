[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] Here's a tale we're here to tell.
[time=33] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 94 seconds]
[time=136] Such a meeting cannot be coincidence.
[time=138] It just so happens that we are tellers of tales.
[time=141] With a story to be told.
[time=143] [APPLAUSE]
[time=146] And it would seem that you all have ears.
[time=149] Oh, wow.
[time=150] Yes. Well, yes, they do.
[time=152] It has been confirmed. You do.
[time=154] Therefore, we present this morning for your entertainment and pleasure,
[time=161] your enlightenment and celebration. A story.
[time=163] A story entitled, Christmas.
[time=168] Ah, yes, but this story neither begins nor ends where you may suspect a baby.
[time=174] A manger, shepherds, and wise men.
[time=178] Yet all of these things, these represent the ending of our story.
[time=183] The grand finale.
[time=184] Finale, the most important part of the story, the part of the story to which all other parts have been leading up to.
[time=190] True, but this part of the story, the part in the manger, the part with the baby, the shepherd, and the wise men, these do not come into our story yet for they represent the ending of our story.
[time=202] And so, we take you to the beginning.
[time=205] To the beginning.
[time=212] In the beginning?
[time=213] That's an opening line.
[time=215] In the beginning.
[time=217] In the beginning was the word.
[time=218] And the word was with God.
[time=222] Word, raw material taken from trees and milled into lumber.
[time=225] Used in the making of furniture.
[time=227] That's wood.
[time=228] Oh, thank you.
[time=231] Word.
[time=232] Any of the various invertebrates with long rounded, flexible bodies, often without appendages.
[time=237] Yeah, that would be worm.
[time=239] Oh, no.
[time=240] Hey, you got this.
[time=244] Go.
[time=245] Word.
[time=246] Used, typically, to mean the Bible.
[time=249] Keep reading.
[time=250] Also, used, typically, by the Apostle John to refer to Jesus, the Savior and Messiah, C. John 1-1.
[time=258] In the beginning was the word.
[time=260] And the word was with God.
[time=264] That's it.
[time=265] [APPLAUSE]
[time=267] In the beginning was the word.
[time=270] Jesus.
[time=271] And the word was with God.
[time=274] He was with God in the beginning.
[time=276] And so, we beg you to entertain the fact.
[time=279] The fact.
[time=279] The truth.
[time=280] That Jesus was with God before the creation of the universe.
[time=285] And even then.
[time=286] Even then.
[time=287] His thoughts were of Christmas.
[time=290] The time before time began.
[time=293] The place, the universe, before it was the universe.
[time=297] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[time=300] But you were on His mind.
[time=302] In the beginning, God laid the foundations of the earth.
[time=305] But you were on His mind.
[time=307] Through Him, all things were made.
[time=309] But you were on His mind.
[time=311] He was thinking of you, of being with you, for Christmas.
[time=315] Of coming for you on Christmas.
[time=318] For this is what was foremost on His mind.
[time=321] Well, the universe was moving into place.
[time=323] Well, the stars ignited and the planets were blasted into their orbits.
[time=327] God.
[time=327] This God of power.
[time=329] God.
[time=329] This God of love.
[time=330] This God of wonders.
[time=332] Was thinking of Christmas with you.

[time=611] The prophet, prophet, someone sent by God to speak to the people for Him, a messenger.
[time=623] I speak for God.
[time=628] Yeah, right.
[time=629] Tough job.
[time=631] You have no idea.
[time=636] God has not left you.
[time=638] In fact, all that's on His mind is being with you.
[time=642] Yeah, right.
[time=643] Does it look like He's with us?
[time=645] But you're not looking for Him.
[time=649] Not really.
[time=650] What do you think we're doing?
[time=652] Yeah.
[time=653] I mean, haven't you been listening?
[time=655] Wining about your problems is not the same as looking for God.
[time=659] Hey, I am not whining.
[time=662] Are you telling me I'm not looking for God?
[time=665] No.
[time=667] But God understands.
[time=675] You need to see Him.
[time=678] You long to see Him.
[time=682] Yeah, that would help if we could just see Him.
[time=685] Yeah, that's going to help.
[time=688] And so He's coming.
[time=690] He's sending forth His own Son.
[time=692] No.
[time=693] Yes.
[time=694] Well, tell Him to come.
[time=695] Well, tell Him unto us a child will be born unto us a son, God's son will be given.
[time=707] He will be called...
[time=708] Wonderful counselor, mighty God, ever-lasting father.
[time=712] Prince of peace.
[time=714] Yes.
[time=715] He will be called.
[time=720] He will be called Emmanuel.
[time=725] God with us.
[time=726] Emmanuel.
[time=729] He will pay the way for you to be with God.
[time=733] Pay your ransom once and for all.
[time=737] Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[time=744] You will reject Him when you see Him, but He will come anyway.
[time=752] Oh, come, oh, come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel.
[time=777] The mourns in lonely exile here until the Son of God appears.
[time=790] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel shall come to thee.
[time=805] Oh, Israel, oh God, my God, earnestly I seek you.
[time=817] My soul thirsts for you and a child, very late.

[time=1005] Oh, we know that one.
[time=1011] The day that all creation has waited for is here, Christmas day is upon us.
[time=1023] There's our falling hearts are failing, how we need to hear from God.
[time=1033] You've been promised, we've been waiting, welcome, holy child, welcome, holy child.
[time=1050] If no room for Mary and Joseph, they find themselves in a stable full of animals.
[time=1057] Now?
[time=1058] Now, a manger, just outside the town, poor men, oblivious to the fact that in moments
[time=1067] the skies will split open with the rejoicing of heaven, far from the east, travelers,
[time=1073] wise men, who have begun the journey following a new star signifying the coming of God to
[time=1082] earth.
[time=1083] Hope that you don't mind our manger, how I wish we would have known, but long awaited,
[time=1096] holy stranger make yourself home, please make yourself at home.
[time=1109] For this, this is the climax of God's story.
[time=1114] This is what was on his mind, from the start, his grand entrance, his debut in the flesh,
[time=1121] his appearance into our lives, to give us all that we've hoped for.
[time=1130] So bring your peace into our violence, bid our hungry souls be filled, we're now breaking
[time=1145] heaven's silence, welcome to our world.
[time=1156] And into the silence, a sound splits the air, a baby, welcome to our world, welcome to
[time=1174] our world.
[time=1204] So bring your peace to our world, welcome to our world, welcome to our world, welcome
[time=1219] to our world.
[time=1221] To our world, welcome to our world, welcome to our world, welcome to our world.

[time=1508] unto us his born unto us his born, for it has escaped even us on this day of celebration
[time=1528] that this story has no ending for his birth leads to his death when they came to the place
[time=1537] of the skull there they crucified him and his death leads to his life don't be alarmed
[time=1544] the man said you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified he has risen and his life leads to your life your life your life and so with this recent turn of events
[time=1561] we will not cannot refuse to leave him lying as a baby in a manger when the story comes
[time=1567] to an end for in fact he stands alive still hand stretched out to you and so you see ladies
[time=1578] and gentlemen we will not end this story this morning with a grand finale as planned for
[time=1584] it seems that this story has become a choose your own ending of sorts and so we leave such
[time=1592] choosing to you where will you have the story end where will the Jesus of Christmas end
[time=1614] up for you safe and sound just a baby in a manger or a personal God who still does wonders
[time=1623] rob our sin and make us holy perfect son of God how will you end the story perfect son
[time=1642] of God the story of Christmas
[time=1668] yeah I like the last question from the drama it was really good I want you to just grab
[time=1674] on to that where will the Jesus of Christmas end up for you safe and sound just a baby
[time=1680] in a manger or a personal God who still does wonders just hold on to that we're going to
[time=1686] come back to that but before we get to that I'd like to just I just like Christmas time
[time=1692] I don't know if you guys do but I love it ever since I was a kid I loved Christmas time especially when I was a little kid you know you mom and dad tell you go to bed at by eight o'clock and they wanted you in bed early so you know they could Santa could come right so Santa so they Santa could come so he could so they he could Santa was gonna be there if
[time=1712] he went to bed early enough the Christmas presents would be there Santa would be there
[time=1718] and now you know right around age I don't know how old I was 16 you know you kind of knew what you were getting for Christmas you know you kind of had the you kind of had Santa figured out you knew how to write him letters you know how you get what you wanted and so
[time=1733] you know so it kind of lost a little bit but now I have little girls have a little I have two daughters and so Christmas is kind of there's this magical and it's kind of fun again it's kind of to see them and I'm like go to bed early or we'll come and we do that and they're smarter they they figured it out a while ago but I'm not gonna say what they figured out because I got a text and say don't say that like you did for a server so Santa will come and it's gonna be good and so to go to bed early boys and girls or he won't
[time=1765] come he just won't happen you'll get nothing and you can you look around if you in my like
[time=1772] my neighborhood there's people and they're up on the roofs and they're scooching around on the roofs and they got the big shiny staple gun and they're putting their lights up right
[time=1782] then if you drive around town you see those big old inflatable Santa's and those big old inflatable you know frosty the snowman which I'm not sure how he got into Christmas another
[time=1793] message but he's in there and Rudolph you know they got those plastic reindeer all stuck
[time=1799] around and we just do we just kind of do some stuff during Christmas we throw stuff out
[time=1805] and then then of course there's the shopping anybody go to the mall on that black whatever day come on raise your hand I know you did it's okay all right and it's like two point
[time=1815] eight trillion dollars are spent on like iPods and that's it that's not to mention anything
[time=1821] else it's crazy and those are the signs we see them all around us but some of my favorites
[time=1827] some of my ultimate favorites are the movies the music and the food and the food we'll get
[time=1835] to that but first the movies as like I don't think I said this in the first of it I don't know if you remember this when I was a kid it seemed like every year we watched this show called the night they saved Christmas and I remember that anybody couple okay I was always
[time=1851] like oh no they're dynamiting on site bees Santa's gonna die okay did anybody know okay
[time=1857] you know I'm talking about okay so that was something we watch it seemed like every year then there's the classics right the Christmas story I think we got a picture right the Christmas story everybody seen that okay yeah when the mom gets the little brother to eat his food
[time=1871] like a little piggy awesome so good so funny I love all and then there's it's a wonderful
[time=1879] life I mean that's pretty classic movie right little it's a wonderful life and there's oh this is a good miracle on 212th Street it's 34th but to turn sounds way better and don't
[time=1894] forget newcomer Will Ferrell and Elf a month elf right okay and of course my all time favorite
[time=1903] all time favorite Christmas movie die hard it's a good show kids go to bed we're gonna
[time=1914] watch die hard it's a Christmas movie then there's the music seems like the radio stations
[time=1921] get hijacked by lunatic elves and like the day after Halloween they start playing all the Christmas music that you can think of how many times can we hear grandma got ran over by a reindeer in one season I think they're going for a record this year then there's the food you guys like the food it seems like in every family there's one aunt or grandma
[time=1943] or somebody who makes something and you're just like oh grandma's or aunt so and so and you're just you're just ready for it because that's about the only time you see them it's Christmas time and they bring you great food my favorite is my grandma makes these amazing
[time=1957] apple pies and what I like to do is I take take the pie and I cut a piece and I put that
[time=1963] here and I take the rest of the pie and then I do and I fill it up like a gallon of ice
[time=1970] cream and I put it in this big bowl and put it in the nuke and nuke it until it almost comes soup and I eat it it's so good try it try it's really good it's really really
[time=1980] good so I love that stuff and me and my brother we do that we just dominate the apple pie
[time=1986] so but it's safe to say that something in our world shifts during this time of year something
[time=1995] happens in the world something is going on you can almost smell it in the air you can look
[time=2002] around that in the towns in the countries across the world across the nation something
[time=2008] shifts something happens and I looked up I liked how the drama I did some definition looking up and I appreciate them omitting the last one that they were going to explain that one because there's kids in here and the annual this is what it says it's a noun I don't know if that matters but it says it's the annual festival of the Christian church commemorating the birth of Jesus celebrated on December 25th and now generally observed as a legal holiday
[time=2035] and an occasion for exchanging gifts it must be something bigger than that going on it can't
[time=2046] just be about a legal holiday and exchanging gifts I mean if it's just about this fat jolly
[time=2053] guy who breaks into your house drops off some presents and steals all your cookies it can't
[time=2059] just be a sentimental time when we get family together and we hang out and we don't like our families that much do you maybe you don't want to put words in your mouth but it's got
[time=2070] to be something bigger than that if it's about oh it's about presents and gifts and it's the
[time=2076] thought that counts well what were you thinking when you gave me socks come on we'll need socks
[time=2084] it has to be cosmic something universal something had to have happened in history
[time=2090] to impact almost every culture on the planet something has happened it has to be bigger
[time=2096] because if it's all the other stuff it's just if it's just lights and trees and Santa and gifts and
[time=2104] apple pie then why are we here what are we doing here what does this building exist
[time=2112] if it's just all that other stuff and going to church makes no sense
[time=2118] I mean let's be honest sometimes church it gets a little boring I get bored sometimes
[time=2124] so there's so many other things we could give our time to then just come into church if it's all
[time=2130] those other things if it's just gifts and cookies and aunt and uncles coming over you see once a year so if the answer to that question we're going to come back to it again later
[time=2149] the answer to that question it has to be bigger it has to be more than just Christmas time so if you hear this morning I'm hoping that you're here because you think it's
[time=2162] something bigger and we're going to talk about we're going to talk about that just a little bit and maybe you haven't got there yet maybe you're not sure it's Christmas I'm cool with that okay cool we're glad you're here we're going to talk about that and hopefully by the end of this time together we'll have a little bigger picture of why Christmas why we do this drama
[time=2182] why this building exists why we're here why we worship why we've submitted our lives to this
[time=2188] guy this savior of the world named Jesus so I think it's bigger and way more majestic than just a
[time=2194] baby and a manger all cute and cuddly so here's where we're headed we're going to look at three verses basically I don't want to call them passages because I'm just using about three verses and they're all out of the gospel of john and so here we go there's the first one we heard it in
[time=2209] the drama and so I want to begin here and right off the bat right of the story this beginning story
[time=2215] right off the bat john wants to make sure we know who he's talking about the very first words off
[time=2222] his pen this is how he begins his gospel in the beginning was the word and the word
[time=2230] was with God and the word was God he wants us to know right off the beginning that before we go
[time=2238] any further we're dealing with the hero in the story the same guy who lays razzlers the same guy at the well the same guy who created all things is the same guy who laid down his life for us
[time=2250] this is Jesus the eternal son of God that's the first thing in the beginning was the word and the
[time=2257] word was with God and the word was God that we might say it this way in the beginning was God's
[time=2263] self-expression this self-expression was with God he was related to God on the same level
[time=2270] maybe equal with God we're talking about the trinity there and this self-expression was God
[time=2276] God's own self now good question to ask is why did he use the word word why did john use the word
[time=2285] word out of all the other words he could have used he used the word word here's three reasons
[time=2291] possibly why for example in Genesis one we get the beginning in the beginning same way it starts
[time=2298] there's this creation thing that happens in the beginning God spoke and all things came into
[time=2305] existence we could say it this way couldn't we by the word of the Lord the heavens and the earth
[time=2314] were made by the word of the Lord the heavens and the earth were made
[time=2321] in the beginning was a word and the word was with God the second another way in the Old Testament
[time=2327] it's used the word of the Lord came to the prophet saying we see that in the Old Testament the word of the Lord came to the prophet to proclaim something to reveal something to reveal a message or some
[time=2339] character about God that he wanted them to know the word Lord came to the prophet saying and a
[time=2345] third way finally the biblical writers often speak of God as sending forth his word to heal
[time=2353] and help and transform his people we see that so this word that john uses in the beginning was the
[time=2363] word this captures all that Jesus is he is God's self-expression God's revelation he is God's own
[time=2371] agent in creation and he comes to transform God's people all of that all that we just said about the
[time=2378] word is right there in that manger all of that is right there john piper answered the question
[time=2385] like this john calls Jesus the word because he had come to see the words of Jesus as the truth of
[time=2391] God and the person of Jesus is the truth of God in such a unified way that Jesus himself in his
[time=2399] coming and working and teaching and dying and rising was the final and decisive message of God
[time=2408] that's all I needed to say in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was
[time=2417] God now that as exciting as that verse is in the truth and the theological pregnant of that verse there's so much more in verse 14 it gets even greater listen to this
[time=2428] in the beginning was the word and the word became flesh let me read it again just in case you missed
[time=2437] it in the beginning was the word and the word became flesh God became man if this was a movie
[time=2444] it would be called the in fleshing starring Bruce Willis the in fleshing God became man if the word
[time=2451] was God and the word became flesh then God became flesh God became human
[time=2457] let me say that again God all powerful sovereign awesome amazing God creator of all things hung
[time=2467] the moon and the stars and he comes to the planet as a man
[time=2473] something bigger has happened than just trees and gifts and presents in apple pie
[time=2486] the verse continues it's not done the word became flesh and dwelt among us
[time=2493] dwelt among us the word for dwelt is the word for set up a tent in the greek this idea of setting
[time=2501] up a tent makes me think and who maybe you too is jumping back to the Old Testament once again
[time=2507] where the tabernacle was set up if you remember your Old Testament history or story remember Moses
[time=2516] God calls Moses right and then chapter 19 God establishes this covenant with Israel as a nation
[time=2524] he says if you obey all the things I have said to you then I will bless your socks off if you don't
[time=2531] there will be curses if you obey then right and then because of God his love he says okay
[time=2539] and then he says okay I'm going to establish some boundaries like the 10 commandments or these loving boundaries say hey here's how you stay in relation with me here's how this works here's how our agreement is going to go and then Exodus 24 the covenant is ratified with blood and
[time=2555] Israel says we will do we will do all that you have said but they don't of course but then
[time=2561] the tabernacle is set up the tabernacle is basically a house for the Lord to dwell in where his presence
[time=2568] would come down it's basically a tent it's like a big portable tent that they would set up and
[time=2576] inside that tent there was this thing called the holy of holies and on the day of atonement a priest would go in and bring sacrifice to atone for the sins of people temporarily
[time=2586] sometimes it was even called a tent of meeting and this is God pursuing man this is God wanting
[time=2592] to come close to his people this is what he establishes we think sometimes we think of the law
[time=2599] and we think oh the law is so it was hard and now we have Jesus and he brings grace but listen
[time=2606] God is the one who established this law God is the one who said set up this tabernacle so my presence
[time=2612] could come down and dwell in this was God's grace this was God's idea
[time=2619] ah he could kind of move closer to his people because the the meta narrative or the theme
[time=2625] throughout all of scriptures I will be your God and you will be my people that is what God wanted
[time=2631] from day one chapter three train wreck sin is in the world that defined plan it needs something
[time=2642] to fix it because the tabernacle the the temporary it wasn't good enough see God had this desire to
[time=2648] forgive right he wanted to forgive and be close to his people but his holiness said you know what
[time=2654] something must take care of sin sin must still be punished so the answer is in the beginning
[time=2662] was word we became flesh and dwelt among us Jesus is the new tent of where God now dwells all his
[time=2670] fullness all of his presence his glory shekinah glory from the Old Testament God comes down
[time=2676] in the flesh as the baby Jesus that is where the tent is that is where we go that is who we go to
[time=2684] now to experience a relationship with God God came close this is God's final word
[time=2691] listen to this I'm not making this up Hebrews 9 chapter 11 but when Christ appeared as a high
[time=2699] priest of the good things that have come then through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands that is not of this creation he entered once for all into the holy places not
[time=2711] by means of blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood thus securing eternal redemption
[time=2721] that's a story that's powerful and then it's not done listen to this we jump to revelation
[time=2729] where the new heavens and the new earth are described as coming and this is where this is kind of how
[time=2735] the story kind of wraps itself up which is a new beginning as kind of the drama said Hebrew
[time=2741] stories were told beginning middle beginning it says this Revelation 21 3 behold the dwelling
[time=2748] the tent of God is with man he will dwell he will set up his tent with them they shall be
[time=2756] his people sin has been taken care of because of what Christ did on the cross so now God can fully dwell he can be with us we can be with him and this tent this idea of a tent
[time=2766] is kind of like if if you come over you're out of town we have you in right okay we have you come in
[time=2773] and if you stay at a hotel our interactions are going to be a little limited because you always got to go back to the hotel and sleep but no no if you command i'm going to set up a tent free in the backyard isn't that nice right but that means you're going to eat at my table you're going to use my toilet you're going to shower you're going to we're going to interact a lot more that's
[time=2793] what Jesus is he's the new tent because God wanted more dealings with us he wanted to be close he
[time=2799] wanted to come to be our God this is awesome this is bonus this is this is free it's Colossians 2
[time=2808] 9 says this foreign Christ all the fullness of the deity lives in bodily form in that little baby right there in that manger all the fullness of the deity God lives in bodily form that means
[time=2823] that when we look around this earth and we see stars and we see mountains and we see oceans
[time=2831] and we see ginormous redwoods that that is just a piece a glimpse
[time=2840] of the fullness of the glory of God because all of it is in Jesus what he did on that cross
[time=2849] is the fullness of God and we look around this planet that's just a glimpse of God's power and
[time=2857] his awesomeness and his amazing creation and design and creativity a couple years ago i got to go
[time=2865] to the Grand Canyon with my buddy Jay we go hiking every year we've been doing it for six years now
[time=2871] and the Grand Canyon was our five-year anniversary together and we decided to go big we said we're
[time=2878] going to do the big ditch and so we got on the plane and we we fly over there and we drive a
[time=2886] couple hours we got to do like an hour off-road to get to our trail because we wanted to do you know we don't want to go to the tourist spot we're going nobody else was all right we want to be a while we're gonna be just gone unplug everything we do it every year this past year i went to
[time=2903] went to Colorado it was awesome and we pull up we're in this big Rubicon Jeep so manly it was just
[time=2910] bad it was good you know we're bouncing around and we pull up and you kind of we kind of see it a
[time=2916] little bit on the window and then we get out and we walk up and we're just standing and our trail kind of goes like this and then just it's the canyon it was so huge it was vast and it just looked
[time=2933] like it just never stopped it just kept just go it just was going and i said i'm not going in there
[time=2941] we need to find another place to hike there's a nice little spot right by the truck it was amazing
[time=2950] people die in there they get lost we got lost it was it was the most grueling trip i had ever
[time=2959] experienced trying to climb out of the canyon i mean you're you're you're ascending like 2,000
[time=2965] vertical feet in like five minutes i mean it's just insane and i just kept thinking and we got down to the Colorado river and i'm just looking around i'm like this is my first question is what
[time=2977] happened here what what could have made such a enormous hole it just it didn't make sense
[time=2988] the rest it's just flat and all sudden this is huge enormous hole god you're just the power there
[time=2997] the just the magnitude of how vast it was and you're just looking up and it just seems to keep going
[time=3003] it's amazing for in Christ all the fullness of the deed he lives in bodily form
[time=3010] now in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god in the beginning was the word and the word became flesh and made his dwelling among us
[time=3022] why before anything was there was father-son holy spirit and they were good perfect relationship
[time=3035] perfect love interaction they're playing cards they're hanging they're good they're
[time=3042] fellow shipping together there's there's no sin there's no problems nothing except complete
[time=3049] and utter unity and for why then why create why why are we here we messed it all up
[time=3058] we always mess it up we do why john tells us later in chapter three for god so loved
[time=3069] the world for god so loved the world that's why we're here that's what it's about
[time=3078] and we see this verse we see it in baseball games we see it on bumper stickers and t-shirts
[time=3084] d Carson wrote this book called the difficult doctrine of the love of god check it out it's interesting so what kind of love are we talking about see today in our world love is so conditional or
[time=3098] performance based if you do this then i'll love you if you if you have something to offer me then
[time=3105] i'll love you if you get the a oh oh i love you if you score all the points or all the goals or
[time=3112] pin the guy or play the right note then i love you we put these expectations on people and we
[time=3119] don't even know it this idea of love is so pervasive that we we actually think that we can perform for god somewhere in in our mess up we all have that no attic effect of sin where we we got some
[time=3133] messy stuff wires all crossed right we think that if we perform go to church enough read my bible
[time=3140] enough i pray enough if i give enough god will love me more or or god will it or then
[time=3148] sometimes we think oh well why shouldn't god love me i'm a pretty nice guy i've killed anybody
[time=3155] i don't lie not much i'm good looking god should love me let me look oh my god
[time=3165] look at this tag all right why shouldn't god love me see that's not that's not what it's about
[time=3172] see god looks down and he sees straight into our hearts and he sees the sin in us he sees the
[time=3179] wickedness he sees the idols that we have built he sees hatred he sees malice he's jealousy the
[time=3185] junk that is in us and he says i love you anyway he sees us for who we are and he says i love you
[time=3193] anyway see a lot of times we don't want anybody to know who we really are we don't want anybody
[time=3199] to know that we have problems just like everybody else what and sometimes at church we play the game
[time=3206] hey how you doing oh fine doing great things you're not let's talk let's figure it out let's go
[time=3212] talk about and figure it out there'd be like going to walmart okay and you get this big
[time=3218] heart card all right it's got some frilies and some fufu and some whatever you know really cool doily stuff make it look pretty whatever my wife loves me i'm not going to gift and so this is not marriage advice this this is not don't
[time=3233] don't do this okay and inside the car says dear love of my life you are the most wicked an unattractive gal i've ever met because i said this is not marriage advice you smell
[time=3246] your lives are too numerous to count you treat me like i'm there just to create your every wish i think you're a rapper baby who dresses like a prostitute love you bill
[time=3259] see god's loves we are we're wicked we have sin we have junk and god says i love you anyway
[time=3267] that's why i'm here that's why i had to come because you're so screwed up i had to come down here
[time=3275] myself and fix it that's why he's here that's why we're here celebrating this baby jeez right there
[time=3281] listen to these just a couple save not see there's nothing in us that is so level what simply because
[time=3289] that's the kind of god he is because god is self-existent his love has no beginning because god is so
[time=3296] eternal his love has no end because god is infinite his love has no limit because god is holy his love
[time=3304] is spotless and because god is immense his love is incomprehensible and the measure of his love
[time=3311] is jesus the measure of his love is jesus that little bundle baby joy over there is jesus
[time=3322] so what do we have in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
[time=3333] in the beginning was the word and the word became flesh and made his dwelling among us why
[time=3339] for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not
[time=3346] perish but have eternal life for god to not send his son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him whoever believes in him is not condemned but
[time=3357] whoever does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the
[time=3364] only son of god a baby in a manger or a personal god who invaded the planet took on sin and made
[time=3377] us holy so we could have life in him for eternity i remember my first christmas when it all made
[time=3386] sense i came to christ at 17 before that christmas was gifts and fun sledding but i remember my first
[time=3396] christmas after i gave my life to christ everything made sense all the songs they were singing made
[time=3404] sense joy to the world made sense coming manual made sense baby jesus made sense i never understood
[time=3416] that so when you give your life to christ when you decide to bend that knee and you step across that line you say i'm going to follow you christ all that stuff starts to kind of fill in because there's this thing called the holy spirit that is a universal gift to all believers
[time=3432] the interprets and he helps and he shows us the truth of who god is and what god has done for us
[time=3442] i just remember my first christmas see jesus isn't just a baby in a manger anymore he is
[time=3449] the god who invaded this planet got up on that cross paid for the sins and allows us to have
[time=3459] that personal relationship with him let's pray father god we are so thankful for this time of
[time=3467] year and we can take a look maybe refocus on what you have done who you are and your love for us
[time=3476] that we see in that baby jesus may christmas never just become gifts and food and music and
[time=3484] movies and lights and tinsel but may it always be about you and your majesty and your awesomeness
[time=3494] and your redemptive action
[time=3524] you
