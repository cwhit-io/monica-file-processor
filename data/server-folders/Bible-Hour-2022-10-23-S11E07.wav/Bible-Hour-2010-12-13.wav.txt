[time=418] (applause) - Good morning, everybody.
[time=423] I'm so glad that you're here with us.
[time=425] We thought we'd be singing by ourselves today.
[time=428] It's bad weather.
[time=430] It was bad at five when I woke up.
[time=432] I don't know if it was any better for you.
[time=434] My name's Corbin Miller on the worship pastor here at Blackhawk, and it's an honor for us to do what we're about to do this morning.
[time=441] Present offering after offering of musical worship to our great and glorious God.
[time=447] I'm also happy that you're here to watch us worship him, and I hope that you worship him in your hearts today as we sing and make melody to him together.
[time=456] We're also excited today to have the Blackhawk Christian, junior and senior high school choirs join us on the rest of our songs today.
[time=463] I think you really enjoy what you're about to hear and see.
[time=466] So thanks for being here.
[time=467] Let's worship together.

[time=752] [MUSIC - 610 seconds]
[time=1382] What a great beginning to a really special morning and we're really thankful. I mean that my name's Kelly and on behalf of the entire Black Hawk Ministries family. I want to welcome all of you to our special special morning. There are a lot of kids in the choir this morning. All of them apart of our Christian school junior high and high school, but not all of them Black Hawk Ministries kids. We're privileged as a school.
[time=1411] To be in partnership with probably over 70, 80 local churches represented in our student body and there may be many of you this morning who are here from those church bodies. You've come to support your young man or your young woman this morning. We're thankful for you. We're thankful for your church and we're really privileged to be able to partner with you as we invest truth and love and wisdom into these young men and women and it's great to have you with us. I want you if I can just get you to think about one thing.
[time=1440] There's probably a lot going through your mind this morning, but I love that song and I love the message of that song and I want to just get you, if I can't just think about one thing as you listen to the lyrics there. I played my best for him.
[time=1460] You can see the picture, the king has come and the wise men have come and the gifts are being poured on and those were great gifts, but they were huge.
[time=1472] I mean, they were significant gifts being given and you can imagine being in the presence of a king and you and I can imagine feeling as if we don't really have enough to give.
[time=1483] We want to honor him and we want to make much of him and all the little guy could do was just play his drum because it's really all he could do.
[time=1496] It was the gift he'd been given. It was what he was able to do and so he did it.
[time=1505] And I would just want to remind you, every one of you this morning, I mean it, every one of you in this room this morning, no matter how old you are, no matter how young you are, no matter how long you've been at this,
[time=1522] whether you're a boy or a girl, a man or a woman, a mom or a dad, a grandma, a grandpa, it doesn't matter. Every one of you, I would encourage you this morning to follow suit, to play your best for him,
[time=1535] to take that opportunity that you uniquely have, you, to take that gift that you've been given, to take your time and your talent and/or your treasure,
[time=1550] and to think about, to literally listen, to ask God right here today and maybe even in the days to come say this, say God please, I want to, in the midst of this season, I want to give a gift.
[time=1563] I want to bring an offering. I want to be an encouragement. I want to make much of you and I don't have a lot, but with my time, talent or treasure God, what would you want me to do?
[time=1577] Who could I serve? What need could I meet? How could I, just me, simple mean with the little bit that I have, how could I in this season make a difference in somebody's life?
[time=1593] I wonder if you think about that. I wonder if you think about those that you work with. Maybe think about those that you live nearby, maybe some people in your family, young people, old people, everybody in the room.
[time=1606] Would you think today and would you be willing to pray, oh God, give me the chance to play my drum, to do it well, to do it as unto you and in the process, make a difference?
[time=1619] Kids, suggestion, it snowed a lot last night. Your driveway's probably need shoveled.
[time=1624] You could be a blessing to your mom and dad. Go home. Mom and dad, can I hear your name in?
[time=1629] No, I hope, I hope every one of you would really give thought to playing it as best you can for him and in the process, loving, serving, encouraging another.
[time=1659] Have you. Have you. Have you. Have you. Have you. Have you heard about the baby, the child of Bethlehem?
[time=1685] Have you heard about the story? Trustees, the will toward men. He came from God the Father to be your diamond. Have you heard about the child of Bethlehem?
[time=1701] Made a sight, and a bed is coming. To be ready, and when it's lost and closed. He was born to Virgin Mary, just to call to your mom and brother. Have you heard about the baby, the child of Bethlehem?
[time=1729] Have you heard about the story? Trustees, the will toward men. He came from God the Father to be your diamond. Have you heard about the child of Bethlehem?
[time=1745] Yes, this bed. Came down from town, from heaven. To redeem a soul, save a soul like me.
[time=1757] In his spirit we have liberty. Cause he sets a captive, reactive scream. Have you heard about the baby, the child of Bethlehem? Have you heard about the story? Trustees, the will toward men. He came from God the Father to be your diamond.
[time=1786] Have you heard about the child of Bethlehem?
[time=1831] When the wrappings have all been undone.
[time=1855] When the carols for a season sun. When that manger scene comes off the shelf. I'm trying to trust that story for myself.
[time=1877] How a father's love would grant his son. To reclaim his lost and helpless ones. That the lame would walk and the blind would see. It all reminds me of the mystery.
[time=1904] Neither life nor death nor power's unseen. Not the fears about tomorrow. Neither height nor depth can ever separate us from Emmanuel.
[time=1928] The miracle without us.
[time=1938] When the sorrows love my desperate heart. And all the hope and love and beauty part. When the ache of loneliness and sin.
[time=1957] Douse the fire my peace within. Get in the light of your redeeming love.
[time=1970] The power of your name Lord Jesus. I can scream it from the mountain tops. I'm a child of the King of God with us.
[time=1990] Neither life nor death nor power's unseen. Not the fears about tomorrow. Neither height nor depth can ever separate us from Emmanuel.
[time=2015] The miracle without us.
[time=2039] In the light of your redeeming love. Through the power of your name Lord Jesus. I can scream it from the mountain tops. I'm a child of God.
[time=2106] Neither life nor death nor power's unseen. Not the fears about tomorrow. Neither height nor depth can ever separate us from Emmanuel.
[time=2159] The miracle with us.
[time=2189] In the light of your name Lord Jesus.
[time=2209] No height has seen, no even through you.
[time=2226] To hold for some light. No day, no time, no time.
[time=2244] And when will you come on watching? It's a moment that peace.
[time=2262] Just say God, try to remember to enter and be the sound of hope.
[time=2292] And so, from home and child, it's raised and so long.
[time=2318] For the land of the sea, the flesh of the sea.
[time=2338] And so, from home and child, it's raised and so long.
[time=2388] In the land of the sea, the flesh of the sea.
[time=2414] We have come once again to the time of the year when we celebrate.
[time=2443] So let our hearts fill with holiday, let's clap and rejoice for the birth of the land is why we dance.
[time=2463] Salvation, glory and honor God has given us his son.
[time=2479] And of his kingdom, there is no end.
[time=2485] He will rescue us from our sin. His name is Jesus.
[time=2499] His name, his name, his name. His name is Jesus.
[time=2507] Shepherds, wise standing kings, laid eyes on the child. They worship the baby.
[time=2515] He will still let us worship.
[time=2520] Lift our hands and adore, we know that he's worthy of him.
[time=2528] So let land is through our hearts, for the victory is won.
[time=2537] Salvation, glory and honor God has sent to us his son. And his name is called.
[time=2549] And of his kingdom, there is no end.
[time=2569] And of his kingdom, there is no end. There is no end.
[time=2580] So let land is through our hearts, for the victory is won.
[time=2600] Salvation, glory and honor God has sent to us his son.
[time=2609] And his name is called. Jesus, oh Jesus, his name is called. His name is called.
[time=2621] His wonderful Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. And he will rescue us from our sin. His name is Jesus.
[time=2635] Jesus, yeah, Jesus. His name is called.
[time=2642] Wonderful Jesus. And he will rescue us from our sin.
[time=2650] He will rescue us from our sin. His name is called.
[time=2662] His name is called. Wonderful Jesus.
[time=2668] And he will rescue us from our sin. His name is his name. His name is Jesus.
[time=2692] And he will rescue us from our sin.
[time=2742] Love came gently, soft as a baby, born to a lonely virgin girl.
[time=2765] Wrapped in, wrapped in, laid in a manger.
[time=2773] Love came gently to our world.
[time=2789] All these shepherds and the wisest, bound in beneath the star so bright.
[time=2805] While the nations lay deep in the sun burn, love came gently in the night.
[time=2827] No, no, no, no, no, there are trumpets, heralding hope, have come to work.
[time=2842] For the promise tenderly answered, chosen instead, a humble burn.
[time=2872] Love came gently, sweetly to save us, knowing the price he'd have to pay.
[time=2892] And to all who trust in the Savior, love comes gently.
[time=2906] Love comes gently, love comes gently to save.
[time=2936] Love comes gently, sweetly to save us, knowing the price he'd have to pay.
[time=2965] I hope for all to come together, to love each other.
[time=2984] This Christmas, that war would cease and God won't dwell.
[time=2994] Inside every heart of a man to wish each other well.
[time=3002] For this reason Christ came to earth, behold the joy in his birth.
[time=3016] He brings freedom, save your Christ the key.
[time=3028] For God so came to us one night, that we might have salvation.
[time=3043] And now to nations we proclaim the blessed name of Jesus.
[time=3057] Praise Him to earth, behold the joy in his birth.
[time=3070] He brings freedom, save your Christ the key.
[time=3081] And in our hearts, let praises be heard, and know now.
[time=3092] The power in his word, let every heart know, save your Christ the key.
[time=3110] [MUSIC]
[time=3134] Praise Him to earth, Christ came to earth, behold the joy in his birth.
[time=3148] He brings freedom, save your Christ the key.
[time=3159] He brings the praises be heard, and know now.
[time=3171] The power in his word, let every heart know, save your Christ the key.

[time=3203] Save your Christ the key.
