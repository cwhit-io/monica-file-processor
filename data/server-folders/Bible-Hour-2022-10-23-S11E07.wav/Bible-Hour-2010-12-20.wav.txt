[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Merry Christmas, everyone, and thank you for joining us at our annual Caroling Outreach.
[time=36] By giving people a tangible taste of God's love, we are really getting back to the true meaning of Christmas.
[time=42] [MUSIC - 59 seconds]
[time=104] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=229] (audience applauding) - Hurry up Jackson, we're gonna be late for the caroling outreach.
[time=239] - Oh grandma, I don't want to go.
[time=241] Do I look like a singer?
[time=242] - Now, dear, you know this church has been gathering gift baskets for the less fortunate for over 60 years.
[time=250] I've been doing this since I was a little girl.
[time=253] Won't you give it a chance?
[time=255] - Can we just stay home?
[time=257] I want to go spend the money even soon on a new weekend.
[time=259] - Holy guacamole, Jackson.
[time=262] I think you're gonna be surprised.
[time=264] - Why do you always say that, grandma?
[time=266] Holy guacamole.
[time=267] - I suppose I've been saying it since I was young.
[time=270] It's kind of a good memory.
[time=272] - But back in the olden days?
[time=274] - Yes, from back in the olden days.
[time=277] I'd rather call it the past.
[time=278] - Things from the past don't count.
[time=280] The future is cool.
[time=282] - Oh no, Jackson.
[time=283] The past is valuable to who we are today.
[time=286] - Huh?
[time=288] Hi, Jasmine.
[time=289] How's your grandmother doing?
[time=291] I haven't seen Carol lately.
[time=293] - Oh, she's great Mrs. Way.
[time=294] They said she's over helping set up the baskets through the fellowship hall.
[time=297] - You know, I think I'm gonna go helper.
[time=300] Jasmine, this is my grandson, Jackson.
[time=302] He's staying with me over the holidays.
[time=304] I'll see both of you in a few.
[time=306] - Hi.
[time=308] - Hey.
[time=309] - This is my cousin, Gloria.
[time=311] - Hi.
[time=312] - Hey.
[time=314] - Do you like music?
[time=316] - Music?
[time=317] - Yeah.
[time=317] - Caroling?
[time=318] - No.
[time=319] - Real music, mostly hip-hop's ramp.
[time=322] - Well, I just love Caroling.
[time=325] - Me too.
[time=326] And whenever I hear a church bells, it just puts me in the Christmas spirit.
[time=331] - They're going to sing.
[time=333] - Great.
[time=334] [MUSIC - 89 seconds]
[time=433] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 58 seconds]
[time=499] (audience applauds) - Mr. Olson, there's a big eggnog spill
[time=514] in the fellowship hall.
[time=516] Could you give us a hand, please?
[time=517] - Oh, yes, yes, I'll be right there.
[time=519] - Hey, guys, come here.
[time=532] I've got to show this to someone.
[time=534] - Hey, Lauren, what is it?
[time=535] - The most amazing invention of my short but illustrious career is an inventor.
[time=540] Wait 'til you guys see this.
[time=545] - I can't believe I forgot my cart.
[time=548] Who are they?
[time=550] - Oh, these are my friends.
[time=552] Guys, you know Mr. Olson, the church custodian?
[time=555] - Hey.
[time=556] - Henry Olson, nice to meet you.
[time=559] Norman, I told you this is top secret.
[time=563] My invention can't be revealed to anyone.
[time=566] - His invention, I thought you said it was yours.
[time=569] - Oh, well, see, it's partly mine.
[time=573] I came up with the lever over there and this is the name.
[time=578] - What's the name?
[time=580] - The HO-2000, temporal displacement modulator.
[time=584] (clears throat) - The HO-2000 temporal displacement modulator?
[time=590] (sighs) It's a time machine.
[time=596] - We've got to get comin'.
[time=597] - It's gonna be a long day.
[time=599] Good luck.
[time=601] Wait a minute.
[time=603] - What's a time machine?
[time=605] - Thank you, Gloria.
[time=607] A time machine, my doubting friends, can transport you anywhere in the past or a future.
[time=613] - I'd rather be caroling.
[time=614] - I think it's exciting.
[time=616] You could use it to visit the future.
[time=619] - The future, cool.
[time=620] That's a lot better than going backwards.
[time=623] - What are you going to do, Mr. Olson?
[time=627] - Oh, I'm gonna be rich.
[time=629] I'm gonna start a new life.
[time=631] I'll buy stock in Microsoft in 1978.
[time=635] I'll become best friends with Walt Disney in 1930.
[time=639] Maybe pick up a few historical artifacts on the cheap.
[time=643] Let me tell you, kids, whoever said money can't buy happiness is only trying to keep us all from knowing the secret to happiness.
[time=651] Yeah, but anyway, I'll just punch in the date.
[time=655] December 24th.
[time=657] - Mr. Olson, the egg knocks bell.
[time=659] Can you please help us?
[time=661] - Oh, yes, yes.
[time=662] I'll be right there.
[time=664] Just get my cart and, oh, kids, now don't touch anything.
[time=670] - Oh, isn't she a beauty?
[time=676] - We're not supposed to touch it.
[time=678] Yeah, what could happen?
[time=680] - Jackson, what did you do?
[time=682] - What's going on?
[time=683] What's happening?
[time=684] - I don't know, but I think it's working.
[time=690] - Phew, we saw the cart sighing, Norman.
[time=694] - That was weird.
[time=700] I don't know what happened.
[time=702] - Hey, what's wrong with that bro's hair?
[time=704] - Something definitely happened.
[time=709] - Seriously, what is up with the hair?
[time=712] - Um, guys, I think something happened.
[time=715] - Merry Christmas, everyone, and welcome to our 34th annual caroling outreach.
[time=720] - Did you hear that?
[time=721] 34 years instead of 66.
[time=724] And if this is the 34th, then that means it must be...
[time=727] - 1978.
[time=732] [MUSIC - 130 seconds]
[time=867] - Before we go on a fellowship, Paul, I recommend you have a theme for us today.
[time=871] First, John 3, 16, and 18.
[time=874] We know what real love is, 'cause Jesus gave it his own life for us.
[time=878] Year show, let's not merely say we love each other, let's show the truth, by our actions.
[time=883] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 33 seconds]
[time=926] (audience applauding) - Guys, I think we have a problem.
[time=931] - You are not okay.
[time=932] I am simply not just for this time period.
[time=935] I can go shopping!
[time=937] - And I have thought I would be called dead listening to disco.
[time=941] - No, no, no, no.
[time=942] See, the time machine, it's operating on its own.
[time=946] Miss Earls, and he didn't finish programming it, and the controls must have been disconnected.
[time=951] - Guys, this is making us sound again.
[time=954] - That's the sound it made before it jumped through time.
[time=956] Quick, everyone, get in.
[time=958] - Gloria, take my hand.
[time=960] How do we know where we're going?
[time=961] - We don't. - We don't.
[time=963] (dramatic music) - You see me from 1978, thank you.
[time=974] Sadly, no one was there to save our parents from 1978.
[time=978] (audience laughing) - Are we home?
[time=982] Is everyone all right?
[time=984] - Well, if you can call a toxic exposure to disco all right.
[time=988] - Oh, we're not home.
[time=989] Looks like it's 1985.
[time=992] - This is like the dark ages.
[time=994] They didn't even have computers in 1985.
[time=997] - Actually, the first freely programmable computer was invented in 1936.
[time=1001] Of course, it was the size of my bedroom, and of course, there was no internet.
[time=1005] - No internet or cell phones.
[time=1008] How did people live?
[time=1011] And why do we keep coming back to this lame outreach?
[time=1015] I would anyone want to waste their Christmas Eve doing something like this.
[time=1020] - I like sharing God's love at Christmas.
[time=1023] My mom says that Christmas is about giving.
[time=1026] - That's what my grandma says too, but I don't get it.
[time=1029] You're giving food and gifts to people who have no way to pay you back.
[time=1032] - You won't get virtual life by doing that.
[time=1035] - I couldn't help overheating you, young man.
[time=1037] Christmas is a time where we remember the greatest gift God gave us.
[time=1041] Jesus, he gave that expecting anything return just because he loved us so much.
[time=1047] Why don't you join us as we practice a few Christmas carols?
[time=1049] - Okay.
[time=1050] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 127 seconds]
[time=1184] (audience applauding)
[time=1191] - Norman, have you figured out how to fix the machine so we can go home?
[time=1196] - And not yet.
[time=1197] We seem to be skipping through Christmas Eve's and the years seem to be jumping randomly.
[time=1202] - At least as a wine center for the machine jumps, I would hate to be stuck in a place with no cell phones.
[time=1208] - Or decent music.
[time=1209] - Yeah, me too.
[time=1211] At least we're not lost.
[time=1213] We're still at church.
[time=1214] Are you kidding me?
[time=1216] - Quick, everyone, get in.
[time=1217] (dramatic music) - Are you guys going to the caroling outreach?
[time=1229] - Ugh, this outreach again, you'd think we could at least travel somewhere more exciting.
[time=1235] - If we don't get home soon, I think I'm gonna have to call my mom.
[time=1239] - I have a dime if you want.
[time=1241] - Oh, thank you.
[time=1242] Why would I need a dime?
[time=1243] - For the phone, Silly.
[time=1245] - Oh, thank you.
[time=1247] - No cell phones in 1959, Gloria.
[time=1250] People use headphones when we're away from home.
[time=1252] - Oh, Jackson, anybody home?
[time=1256] - That's weird, did she look familiar to you?
[time=1259] - Oh, yeah, last time I was in 1959, we went to the mall together.
[time=1263] - That's impossible, there's no malls in 1959.
[time=1266] - Thanks, trivia, Saurus.
[time=1267] - Hey guys, we're just about to get started.
[time=1269] Why don't you join us?
[time=1271] - Okay.
[time=1273] - Merry Christmas, everyone.
[time=1274] Those beautiful bells you are hearing signal to start with our 14th annual curling outreach.
[time=1280] You know, the Bible says that on the greatest commandments is love your neighbors as much as we love ourselves.
[time=1286] By reaching out to our friends and neighbors in our community, we will be fulfilling that great commandment.
[time=1291] (upbeat music)
[time=1316] [MUSIC - 157 seconds]
[time=1474] - This doesn't seem practical if you're always thinking about someone else who takes care of you.
[time=1479] - Well, God has pied on my needs so far.
[time=1482] I have so much, a loving family, a place to live, swell friends.
[time=1487] I can't help but want to share with others.
[time=1489] - You know, you really remind me of someone from school or something.
[time=1494] - I have one of those faces, I guess.
[time=1496] - I see you've met our little bundle of inspiration.
[time=1500] - You know, her family is one of the families this outreach helps.
[time=1504] Her dad has been out of work for nine months and they've had a hard time making ends meet.
[time=1510] But she's always thinking of others before herself.
[time=1513] - Oh, wow, that's really cool.
[time=1516] - How rude of me, let me introduce you to Betty.
[time=1519] - Hey Betty.
[time=1520] - Hey Jackson, isn't your grandma saying Betty?
[time=1523] - I guess, wait, Betty?
[time=1525] - Holy guacamole, there's no need to yell.
[time=1528] - Holy guacamole, ah!
[time=1530] - Are you okay?
[time=1531] - Yeah.
[time=1532] - Hey, I gotta go.
[time=1535] Oh my goodness, I think finished my grandma.
[time=1537] - Well, that could be a possibility.
[time=1539] In the 1950s, our grandparents were probably about our age.
[time=1543] - Jackson, you're lucky.
[time=1545] Your grandma's so cool.
[time=1547] - Quick, everyone, get in.
[time=1559] - Jackson, I can't believe that girl was actually your grandma.
[time=1564] - There's no need to yell, Jackson.
[time=1567] I'll admit it wasn't a little weird seeing your grandma as a little girl, but still, there's no need to yell.
[time=1572] - No, she's over there.
[time=1574] - Oh, boy, she had a growth spurt.
[time=1577] - She can't see us here.
[time=1578] I remember us from when she was a little girl.
[time=1582] - Go, go, go.
[time=1585] - Wait a minute.
[time=1595] You look familiar.
[time=1596] Do I know your parents?
[time=1598] - Oh, you know them, especially my mom.
[time=1601] - Oh, point her off to me.
[time=1603] - I'm not sure I would recognize them, I mean, they've changed a lot from how they look today.
[time=1609] - Ma'am?
[time=1610] - Yes.
[time=1611] - Do you have any grandchildren?
[time=1614] - Yes, I do.
[time=1615] Little Jackson's up in the nursery.
[time=1617] - Oh, I was afraid of that.
[time=1619] Well, if he ever like drops his dad's fishing pole in the lake on the 4th of July, when
[time=1625] he's like nine years old, tells dad to go easy on him, it was an accident, I promise.
[time=1633] - He's a strange young man, isn't he?
[time=1635] - Yes, yes he is.
[time=1637] - Merry Christmas, everyone.
[time=1644] - Pastor Joe has asked me to introduce our special guest to you all tonight.
[time=1649] They've traveled a long way for our 54th annual outreach, so will you please help me welcome the manger boys.
[time=1657] - Merry Christmas, everyone.
[time=1664] I understand you're about to go through your father's in need.
[time=1668] - We want to encourage you in what you're doing this Christmas.
[time=1671] This song is a Bible story about some sheeps and some bits.
[time=1674] Why don't you listen and see what happened?
[time=1675] [MUSIC]
[time=1698] - We'll be all turned into heaven's gates.
[time=1703] World, heaven's boys, we're all back.
[time=1707] - Shout out.
[time=1710] [MUSIC]
[time=1713] - Like a shepherd, he will go divine and more.
[time=1717] Go turn on the lucky ball of red.
[time=1722] Turn into the Hebrew, blessed and grand smile, the kingdom of God and in your side.
[time=1732] While I was hungry, you gave me food to eat.
[time=1737] I was thirsty, you gave me a drink.
[time=1742] I was a stranger, you were a friend to me.
[time=1747] I was a person, and you did it for me.
[time=1753] - When I went, did we see you hungry?
[time=1758] When I went, did we see you lying, beating on the street?
[time=1764] When I went, did we go you?
[time=1767] Jesus, when I went, did we ever give me something to eat?
[time=1774] - The master turned towards the ghost and answered it.
[time=1777] - For I was hungry, you gave me food to eat.
[time=1783] I was thirsty, you gave me a drink.
[time=1787] I was a stranger, you gave me a friend to me.
[time=1793] I was a person, and you did it for me.
[time=1798] When I went, did we see you hungry?
[time=1804] When I went, did we see you lying, beating on the street?
[time=1809] When I went, did we go you?
[time=1812] Jesus, when I went, did we ever give me something to eat?
[time=1819] - The master said, "I'm telling the song truth." And we didn't want these things to start with overalls, or ignored, that was me.
[time=1829] - You did it all to me.
[time=1832] - When I went, did we see you?
[time=1835] - You did it all to me.
[time=1837] - When I went, did we see you lying?
[time=1840] - You did it all to me.
[time=1842] - When I went, did we go you?
[time=1845] - You did it all to me.
[time=1847] - When I went, did we ever give me something to eat?
[time=1850] - You did it all to me.
[time=1859] - I have an idea.
[time=1864] - Excuse me, Mr. Olsen?
[time=1866] - Yes.
[time=1867] Can I help you, young man?
[time=1868] - Yes.
[time=1869] My name is Norman, and I was wondering if you could help us fix something.
[time=1872] Our machine is broken.
[time=1875] - What kind of machine?
[time=1877] - Well, you know, how about I just show you?
[time=1882] - All right, I suppose I could try.
[time=1888] Impossible, it's just the way I dreamed it.
[time=1892] - It's the HO2,000 Temporal Displacement Modulator.
[time=1895] You invented it.
[time=1896] - I did?
[time=1897] I must be rich.
[time=1899] I can quit my job to travel the world, become even richer.
[time=1904] - Actually, Mr. Olsen, we kind of sort of accidentally took your machine.
[time=1913] So you haven't got some kids to use it yet, but it's broken, and now we can't get home.
[time=1921] - Oh, that is a problem, but let's see.
[time=1925] There should be a lever that would control the direction you go in time, but I don't see anything like that.
[time=1931] - Hey, I think I saw something like that.
[time=1933] - I think you're leaning on it.
[time=1935] - Yes, and I think you were leaning on it the first time it went off.
[time=1940] - Jackson!
[time=1942] Sorry, guys.
[time=1943] - Yes, there it is, but it's been disconnected from the hydraulic evaporators.
[time=1950] That explains why you've been jumping through time.
[time=1953] Let's see, if we line that up and there and tighten, yes, that should do it, but be careful
[time=1961] not to push the lever too far.
[time=1963] If you push it too far in any direction, there's no telling how far you might travel.
[time=1968] It could be catastrophic.
[time=1970] - Don't push it too far.
[time=1972] Got it.
[time=1973] Mr. Olsen, I wanted to know now, it was wheelchair to reengage his lever to put it in the machine toward home.
[time=1978] It's down the right way, Mr. Olsen!
[time=1991] Could you fellas give a girl a hand?
[time=1998] - Jasmine, look, this is the first animal outreach.
[time=2005] - Oh no, I'm guessing the lever was supposed to be pointing up, not down, now we're even
[time=2011] further back in time.
[time=2013] - Thanks, boys.
[time=2014] It's great to know we can counter to help support the cause.
[time=2017] - No problem.
[time=2018] Wait.
[time=2019] What cause?
[time=2020] It's a war effort, of course.
[time=2021] Merry Christmas.
[time=2022] What's going on?
[time=2023] Jackson, it's 1944, World War II.
[time=2028] - Thank you all for coming to our first annual caroling outreach.
[time=2031] As you know, many in our community could use a helping hand this Christmas.
[time=2035] I hope and pray that this can become an annual tradition for many, many years to come.
[time=2050] - We heard the bells on Christmas day.
[time=2057] They're all fun and young.
[time=2060] Carol's lit.
[time=2061] They're wild and sweet.
[time=2062] The words we give of peace on earth.
[time=2065] Good will too.
[time=2067] - We heard the bells on Christmas day.
[time=2078] Our love was certainly far away.
[time=2082] We'll share his love, the best we can.
[time=2087] - We said God's joy on the stars.
[time=2100] - We heard the bells on Christmas day.
[time=2191] - Hey!
[time=2192] - Oh, that's a good little period of words.
[time=2194] - You think so?
[time=2195] - He's a strange young man, isn't he?
[time=2198] - Yes, yes he is.
[time=2200] [MUSIC - 572 seconds]
[time=2775] (audience applauding) Well, let me say this.
[time=2784] I'm sure most of you in the room would agree that anytime you get kids involved.
[time=2790] I'm just thinking about the morning.
[time=2791] Anytime you get kids involved, in the process of communicating, oftentimes what kids will do, if they have an uncanny way of taking what is complicated or immense, and in their own unique way, kids have a way of making things very, what, very simple.
[time=2813] And they did such a great job today of taking what is a huge story filled with enormous truth and making it very, very simple.
[time=2822] And when I think about the Christmas story, when I think about the truth surrounding Christmas, it really is extremely simple.
[time=2833] And I know many of you in the room have been hearing Christmas truth for years.
[time=2838] Others of you, maybe for you, it's the first time or this is all kind of new to you, but either way, here's what is normally talked about.
[time=2847] And I'm not making apology for it at all, but there's kind of an equation that you usually hear at Christmas.
[time=2854] And the equation goes something like this.
[time=2856] We gather to celebrate the birth of our Lord.
[time=2859] We hear about the manger, we hear about the wise men, we hear about Mary and Joseph.
[time=2864] And oftentimes it's true as all that is, and as miraculous as it was, people will then tell you that not only is there the manger, but that the real total all encompassing truth is that the manger led to the cross that Jesus was born to die and die He did.
[time=2880] And they'll tell you that He was born and that He died on the cross to forgive us of our sins and that when you embrace or understand or accept the truth of the manger and the cross that gives you the chance gives me the opportunity to experience someday a place called what?
[time=2900] Say it, heaven.
[time=2901] In a nutshell, powerful, true,
[time=2907] completely true, everything I just said, completely true and integral to the whole story of Christmas, amen?
[time=2916] But simply, I also back to that simple idea and the way that simple truth brings real practical application.
[time=2925] I want to just remind you of something this morning.
[time=2928] Many of you in the room may know this, others of you may have forgotten this, that while that equation is absolutely true, that someday because of the great truth of Christmas, we will get to experience an eternity with the Father who loved us.
[time=2948] While that's true and someday that will happen, I want to remind you this morning of a passage in the gospel of John.
[time=2956] It says in John chapter 10, Jesus here speaking, he says in verse 7, he said to them again, truly, truly I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
[time=2969] That's us.
[time=2971] All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.
[time=2977] I am the door.
[time=2979] If anyone enters through me, he will be saved.
[time=2988] And we'll go in and out and find pasture.
[time=2992] The thief, verse 10, the evil one, the enemy, comes only to steal and kill and destroy.
[time=3001] I came the embodiment of God in the flesh.
[time=3006] I came Immanuel.
[time=3008] God is near that they may have life,
[time=3014] and have it life living abundantly.
[time=3019] And this is what I want you to consider this morning.
[time=3022] In the text here, if you were to study this in the original language, this abundantly, he came at Christmas and yes, he did die.
[time=3033] And while we're thankful for someday the reality of heaven, the new equation kind of goes like this.
[time=3041] The manger leads to the cross, which leads to abundant life.
[time=3047] And in the text that abundant life isn't futuristic, it's today.
[time=3051] It includes the future, but it includes, listen, it includes now, the celebration of Christmas and the great truth of the season, my friends, is that he came so that you could embrace him and in embracing him have abundant life now.
[time=3070] And this is what so many people miss.
[time=3072] So many people, I think, have heard the gospel.
[time=3074] So many people have heard the story of Christmas and its implications.
[time=3078] And when it comes to surrendering one's heart and life to Jesus, embracing the person of Christ, they've kind of felt as if they have to sign off on some resignation to just endure life until heaven.
[time=3089] And it isn't at all what Jesus came to do.
[time=3094] The great truth of Christmas is that he came to give us abundant life.
[time=3099] And I just want you to read this off the screen.
[time=3102] You can write it down, a personal embracing of Jesus, not a personal embracing of religion, not a personal embracing of tradition.
[time=3112] But when you personally, intimately, deeply in your heart,
[time=3119] come to the realization of your need for a Savior and Lord, this embracing of Jesus gives him Christ the opportunity to provide you with abundant, let's start with marriage.
[time=3133] A lot of married people in the room this morning.
[time=3138] And statistically, let alone just reality-wise, we would know that there's a lot of you,
[time=3147] especially in this season, and it doesn't feel real abundant, exceedingly overflowing, rich in quality and quantity.
[time=3157] You and I know that marriage can be difficult.
[time=3160] You and I know that marriage can bring with it its challenges.
[time=3163] But what a great time of year to be reminded that what God designed in marriage and what God designed you to experience with him allows you to love another freely,
[time=3174] allows you to love another without constraint.
[time=3179] This abundant life that he came to give you, you can experience in one of the most intimate relationships there's ever been.
[time=3185] It is real and meaningful and special, abundant relationships.
[time=3191] Because of Christ, because of Christ in you, it gives you the strength and the courage, and it gives you the ability to love difficult people, to stay faithful, to friendships that at times might be taxing.
[time=3205] It gives us abundant marriage, it gives us abundant relationships, it gives us abundant hope.
[time=3211] There are many in the room.
[time=3214] I know this morning, many listening online, many watching on the broadcast, and the fact is that you know as well as I know that there are times, maybe even now for you, where you are looking for something to hold on to.
[time=3227] You are looking for a rope to grab.
[time=3231] You need a life preserver and you need it quick and you know that all the things that get offered you, all the fixes, all the forms of relief,
[time=3242] don't fix and don't bring relief.
[time=3245] You are beginning to understand the great hope found in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=3251] Abundant joy, I bring up joy, and I bring it up especially at this season,
[time=3257] because I want to remind you of the definition, the biblical definition of joy.
[time=3260] It isn't Mary, it's not giddy.
[time=3264] Now joy is the deep, personal, internal understanding,
[time=3270] that a loving Heavenly Father is thoughtfully and with great purpose, orchestrating the events of your life.
[time=3277] You say, "Wait a minute, some of the events of my life aren't so good." A loving Heavenly Father orchestrates the events of your life and provides you
[time=3288] with the ability to count it.
[time=3290] James chapter 1 counted all joy, because in the midst of whatever you and I might face, he provides abundant opportunity, exceeding and overflowing opportunity for you and I
[time=3303] to be joyful, to rest in the comfort of his love, abundant marriage,
[time=3309] abundant relationships, abundant hope, abundant joy, abundant help.
[time=3315] We've talked to two families already this morning, just since I got here at 8 o'clock,
[time=3321] come across two families in our family who find themselves this morning in need of enormous
[time=3330] help, levels of help, they never imagined they'd ever need.
[time=3335] Physically, yes, emotionally, yes, spiritually.
[time=3339] And what an encouraging opportunity for me and for others in our family to come
[time=3345] alongside others, and then I wrote this down, abundant transcendence.
[time=3350] It's a big word, abundant transcendence.
[time=3355] I wanted to end with this. I think it's so cool.
[time=3358] I think one of the great things about embracing Jesus, the one whose birth we celebrate this season,
[time=3365] a relationship with him that begins to transform us and change us.
[time=3371] It gives him the opportunity to provide you with abundant, exceedingly overflowing, transcendence, which means this. You get to be a part, do you realize this?
[time=3380] You get to be a part of something every single day when you choose to follow him,
[time=3386] when you choose to love others more than yourself, when you choose to engage in ministry that moves his kingdom forward, when you do that with kids, when you do it with students, when you do it with those in your workplace, when you do it with your family, transcendence means something beyond us,
[time=3404] something bigger than our own end and our own goals and our own desires.
[time=3409] No, God allows you and me to be a part of what he's doing. It's other. It's absolutely mind-boggling.
[time=3418] It's life transforming, and you and I get the privilege of being on a day-to-day basis a part of something that is beyond us. The ministry of this church, the ministry of your life, and when he is at the root of that, when he is what's motivating that, what a thrill. It's like
[time=3434] nothing. It beats any paycheck. It beats any bonus. What a joy for you and I to be reminded
[time=3443] today that while heaven is a reality and we long for that day, he came that we might have life
[time=3450] and have it what? Say it abundantly. Abundantly now. Doesn't mean you won't have trouble.
[time=3457] Doesn't mean there won't be heartache, but what it means is that when you embrace him,
[time=3463] there is a quality and a quantity of life that is exceedingly above and beyond all we could have
[time=3471] ever asked or thought. Elmer and Darlene Johnson are underwriting today's Bible hour in memory of
[time=3479] Darlene's mother, Florence Hoffman, who loved and served Jesus Christ from her youth until he
[time=3485] called her home on Christmas Day, 2004.
