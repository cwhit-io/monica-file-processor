[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Well, hello again everybody, welcome to the broadcast today.
[time=35] And I don't think you need me to kind of sit here and tell you what a huge priority.
[time=42] The study of God's word is to Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=45] If you know Black Hawk at all, you know that it is foundational.
[time=49] It is one of the values that we hold on to.
[time=53] And it's what makes what I'm about to share with you even more exciting for me.
[time=58] We love the word of God and we're thankful for the change and the transformation it brings to a life.
[time=64] And I want you to meet this morning, Mr. Rod Overt.
[time=66] Hey, bud.
[time=67] - Hello, Kelly, how you doing?
[time=68] - I'm doing great, man.
[time=69] It's good to see you, Rod.
[time=70] And his wife, Carolyn, have become great friends of Cabernet's.
[time=74] They've been friends to our family and they have become friends and really fellow laborers here at Black Hawk.
[time=81] Rod and Carolyn have been teaching and equipping and encouraging our people in a number of different settings for a number of years.
[time=89] And recently, we have seen God bring to fruition, really a dream, a vision that he kind of instilled in Rod and care along the way.
[time=99] And Rod has been talking about this with me.
[time=102] He's been sharing it with our elders.
[time=104] And it looks as if God has brought traction, if I can say it that way.
[time=108] And now it's really taken off.
[time=111] They're calling it Logos Institute of Biblical Studies.
[time=115] And I want Rod to just share with you all, as we talk about it here, just kind of first of all, Rod, where that vision for an institute like this, kind of where it began and what God put on your heart.
[time=127] - Okay.
[time=128] Over the years, teaching for many years, having taught high school and junior high, but in the last probably 15 years or so have been teaching primarily adults.
[time=140] And it was in the preparing of some of that study that my wife Carolyn and I delve deeply into the study of the Eastern culture that was around Palestine at the time of Christ and Paul.
[time=156] And in the study of those cultures, we learned that study was the only thing that would buffer people from assimilation of the culture.
[time=168] The culture was the enemy.
[time=170] And when we studied, we also looked at the inter-testamental period.
[time=178] And the thing that struck me most, and I won't belabor this, but when you read about the exile, and you read prior to that, that the Northern Kingdom, just hoof, they were assimilated, they came in, the Northern Kingdom just was no more.
[time=195] It was an ethnic cleansing, the Assyrians came in, and boom, they were gone.
[time=199] Well, the Southern Kingdom through God's grace was allowed to continue.
[time=203] But near their end, the word of God had become extinct.
[time=209] And they were very wealthy, they were very successful, they were definitely a world ruler, but they were declining.
[time=218] And we find, and we read in the Old Testament, that there was a time when under this young king Josiah, one of the temple people go out into the treasury, and I don't know if he's looking for gold bars or something, but he finds this scroll, and he says, "What's that?" And he comes in, they find out it's the missing word of God.
[time=240] And the question you can ask most people is how close was that to Nebuchadnezzar coming, and what they don't realize, that was 38 years before Nebuchadnezzar came.
[time=252] - One generation.
[time=254] And so, the saying to me would be, you know what Nebuchadnezzar is coming, and we need to get the word of God.
[time=261] And that single act of God's providence and letting Josiah find and rekindle the word of God into the Jewish nation probably changed the whole world as we know it, because otherwise they would have gone into Babylon, been totally assimilated, there would have been no movement of synagogues, the Jewish faith would have been pretty much extinct, Christianity would have to come in another way, but God's providence works.
[time=286] And my whole point about that is that in this culture in which we live, and you as a pastor, I'm sure can attest, that there is a decline in the knowledge of the Bible.
[time=297] There's a severe decline, and some pastors would call it epidemic.
[time=301] I've had pastors say we've had to dumb down, and that sounds crude, but we've had the water down, our teaching about a grade every three years.
[time=311] And so here we are at Blackhawk, a seeker friendly, we've been out there, we're bringing lots of people in, and they're accepting Christ, and they're signing up for discipleship, now's the time to enculturate and to teach the word of God.
[time=326] And so I've, as you know, we've been teaching some adult classes here, but I've been now blowing you and saying, Kelly, what about a bait midrash?
[time=333] And we've joked about that because just briefly, one of the things, when they came out of exile, God and his providence talked to those great wise men of old, and we know from history that they developed the synagogues, the house of study went with the synagogue, the Babylonian, or what they called the Pharisee, or called academies, where tens of thousands of young men and old men would go after the harvest for two months of study.
[time=360] So study became, and Halal the famous rabbi said, you know what, the greatest form of worship is study.
[time=369] And if you can't afford both the synagogue and the bait midrash, sell the synagogue.
[time=374] And so, kiddingly, yet seriously, for a few years, I said, let's sell the church and build a bait midrash.
[time=381] - Yeah, well, and we haven't sold the church, but we have certainly embraced this idea.
[time=385] Blackhawk has, and not just blackhawk ministries.
[time=388] I want Rod to tell you that this Logos Institute is really off and running, and I'm so grateful that there are a handful of local churches and ministries that have really embraced Rod and Carolyn's vision for this, we're so excited.
[time=403] We get to be a part of this, but there are others in the ballgame, and you really have a 2011 kickoff, you know, out in front of us, classes are being offered, people can come and be a part of this learning discipleship opportunity.
[time=418] Tell them where it's at on the ground today.
[time=421] - Briefly, here's what it is.
[time=423] We're actually giving Bible, baccalaureate Bible college courses.
[time=429] Okay, that they are.
[time=430] They're filmed at various different schools, and these profs have all gone to Dallas, theological, or Trinity, they're mostly PhDs, and we're bringing in the entire curriculum.
[time=440] So, we have the Old Testament Survey, New Testament Survey, Life of Christ, 1 Corinthians, Romans, Survey of Doctrine, Dibiliology and Theology Proper, Apologetics, Introduction to Philosophy, A Christian World View, and a number of these classes that you would actually get in a baccalaureate program of Bible.
[time=460] We are facilitating them at five different area churches.
[time=465] On Mondays, there'll be at Lakewood, Park, Baptist, up in Auburn.
[time=470] Tuesdays, they'll be out at the chapel.
[time=472] These are evenings, Wednesday evening, here at Black Hawk, Thursday evening, out at Pathway, and Saturday morning, and we're thrilled about this, Saturday morning will be a greater progressive at the Y that they have, and that's gonna be great, can bring your kids, let 'em play basketball, and take two classes.
[time=489] We're gonna have two classes the night offered, and again, for instance, here at Black Hawk, on Wednesday at six o'clock, will be New Testament Survey at 730, the study of the Book of Deuteronomy.
[time=502] And so again, these are college, there's an hour and a half each.
[time=506] We'll have it on a very excellent tape, and then I'll be facilitating these classes, breaking it up, asking questions, engaging, and so it's really an opportunity, and the best thing is the price is going to be five bucks a night, so a choice of a burrito, or a PhD in the Bible.
[time=521] - Go to Starbucks, or come get a degree.
[time=524] Actually, it's not accredited, but that's kind of intentional.
[time=528] We kind of all agreed that more than anything besides a plaque on a wall, we want to give people.
[time=533] - Exactly.
[time=534] - Economically, something they could afford, and a chance to learn the scriptures, be assimilated into real strong doctrinal, theological understandings, and I can't wait for all of you.
[time=546] I hope all of you who are listening are understanding what a great opportunity this is, and Rod, just in closing, for those who are watching and interested in this, where can they go?
[time=556] How can they actually get signed up?
[time=558] How can they find out more?
[time=559] How can they ask questions?
[time=560] - Right, okay, we have a website, www.logosbiblical.org, so that's logosbiblical.org.
[time=569] And you can go there, it talks about all the classes, we have a calendar on there, you can go online and register, you can fill out an application, fax it, or email it in, you can pay the $50 for 10 classes with a credit card online if you want, or bring it the first day of class.
[time=586] - That's great.
[time=587] - But it's all online.
[time=588] - Good.
[time=589] - www.logosbiblical.org, that'll be on our bottom of the screen, portion of the screen here today.
[time=595] If you have any questions for Rod or Carolyn, we'd be happy to pass those along.
[time=599] Thank you, Rod, for your faithfulness to the Scriptures.
[time=602] Thanks for the encouragement you've been to me on that front, he really has been.
[time=606] And thank you to you for watching today.
[time=608] I hope you got all this.
[time=609] If you have any questions about it, let us know.
[time=612] It's great to have you with us.
[time=613] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=616] God bless.
[time=616] [MUSIC - 62 seconds]
[time=700] (gentle piano music) - That's a great song.
[time=716] They were all great songs, and it was good to hear all of you sing, but what he was just singing there at the end.
[time=721] That is one of my favorites, and I love how it invites you and me both to consider the story of our life.
[time=731] What is the song of your life singing these days?
[time=736] How are you?
[time=739] And what a great time of year for you and I to just take a few minutes and to consider the reality of where we are in our lives.
[time=750] As we come to an end of a year and a new year is just around the corner, how is your life song today?
[time=758] What are its lyrics and what direction is it going?
[time=763] What does it look like?
[time=764] Every life in this room has a song in essence, and what a privilege it is for us on those days when what we can sing, when the lyrics of our life are hallelujah.
[time=778] It's a good thing, but as many of you know, there are days and there are times and there are seasons when the life song isn't at all what we'd wish it would be.
[time=790] It isn't at all what we'd want it to be, and what a great privilege we have to come before our God in times like that for his help and his guidance and his direction.
[time=800] A few weeks ago, I got a note,
[time=806] and I'm gonna try and find it now if I can.
[time=812] Dear Kelly, it read over the past year since I left Fort Wayne and Blackhawk, what I've experienced, what I've seen and what I've done are all things I never would have imagined.
[time=827] I guess I thought I would have been stronger, but it seems weakness has won out.
[time=834] It's left me feeling personally empty and spiritually distant from God.
[time=842] I'm not who I want to be, that is clear, and I'm not where I should be.
[time=847] And with a new year closing in and there is something inside me that wants desperately to get right, to reconnect.
[time=858] Pastor Kelly, I wanna come home.
[time=861] Not so much to a house or a church, although both sound really, really good right now, but to a place of intimacy with the Lord.
[time=871] And I'll read that part again.
[time=873] Pastor Kelly, this person wrote, I want to come home to a place of intimacy with the Lord.
[time=880] I hope and pray that you can point me in the right way.
[time=885] In the new year, I want to choose a new direction.
[time=889] I wanna make new choices and practice new disciplines.
[time=893] Looking forward to Christmas, looking forward to seeing you, thank you for all you do.
[time=898] And the truth is, I believe that there are many of you in the room this morning, many of you watching on the broadcast, many of you listening online that can identify with the cry of that individual's heart.
[time=911] Junior high, high school students in the room,
[time=917] trying diligently, but failing more often than you'd like
[time=924] to live with integrity and purity in a culture that has zero value for either.
[time=931] College students home on a break after a semester
[time=937] that maybe just didn't go at all like you had thought it would.
[time=941] Husbands and wives in the room, trying to hang on to hope.
[time=948] Moms and dads in the room at times overwhelmed by the forces that seem to work against you and us in our efforts with our kids.
[time=959] A thousand different scenarios here today.
[time=963] A thousand different circumstances in the room, but today with 2010 ending, you can say with clarity and you can say in all honesty that you're just not where you know you should be.
[time=976] Something, something's not right in your soul.
[time=984] There's something not right in your life and it's starting to show.
[time=990] Maybe it's been starting to show for weeks or months.
[time=995] Maybe it's been years.
[time=998] Maybe it happened quick, but more than likely it was a slow fade filled with gradual compromise and increased disobedience.
[time=1010] I'll say those two phrases again.
[time=1014] Gradual compromise and increased disobedience coupled with a million excuses.
[time=1022] And today here you sit.
[time=1025] Today here many of you in the room sit longing for a way back, longing for a way to experience a new day, a new beginning, a divine do-over, if you will.
[time=1044] You long for the clarity because it's gotten so for you, it's gotten so confusing.
[time=1052] You long for the hope that comes with forgiveness.
[time=1059] You long for a fresh start.
[time=1062] No marks against you.
[time=1064] I'm gonna ask Corbin if he'd come back up
[time=1070] just for a minute or two.
[time=1072] Was struck by this first hour as I looked around the room and I'm struck by it all over again here second hour as I look at the faces of so many.
[time=1082] When I talk about hoping for clarity because it's all gotten so confusing when I talk about you hoping for the forgiveness that brings a fresh start.
[time=1092] And I look at your faces and with your faces, you know by now after all we've been through together, you know there comes with a face, a story.
[time=1101] There comes with so many of you as I've watched you live your life, the opportunities to experience this.
[time=1112] While this room I think is filled with those who are longing for this today, this room is also filled with those who have experienced it.
[time=1120] You've known in tremendous ways the grace and the forgiveness and the fresh start on the new day that God brings.
[time=1129] And you inspire me and you encourage others and I'm so thankful for the testimony of your lives.
[time=1136] There are others of you though here today as I sit and look out and I know that you are in need of encouragement.
[time=1145] I know as you think to a new year that there is a deep longing in you for a new direction.
[time=1151] And I wanna do something here in just these few moments as Corbin plays that I don't do very often as I've thought about it.
[time=1158] I've kinda just decided I'll do it more often.
[time=1162] I'll do it in my office at times.
[time=1164] I'll do it in settings where I feel like it's it's kind of private or personal.
[time=1170] But I want this to be as private and personal as it can be.
[time=1174] And what I wanna do is I wanna read the word of God over you.
[time=1178] I always try my best to stand here and teach it to you.
[time=1184] I try my best to explain it to you.
[time=1187] But in these moments here as we begin this morning, I just wondered if you'd give me the privilege.
[time=1192] If I could, I'd just have you sit in a chair and I'd just ask you to come and sit down one by one.
[time=1200] And I'd love nothing more than to just put my hands on your shoulders or put my hand on your head and just tell you how much I love you and care for you and just read to you and just say over you the truth and the hope and the beauty of God's word.
[time=1216] So I got a chair they're gonna bring out.
[time=1221] We're gonna be here till four.
[time=1222] (audience laughs) You're just gonna come up one at a time.
[time=1225] But if you would, just allow me to do that.
[time=1229] Would that be all right?
[time=1230] And I'd love for you just to close your eyes.
[time=1232] I don't know if you'll get a quiet moment again today, but let's just make one here.
[time=1236] Then I would love for you just to sit there with your eyes closed if you need to look at the screen and you feel compelled to follow along.
[time=1245] You're welcome to do so.
[time=1246] But I'd love to start this morning by encouraging you, those of you in the room that need encouragement.
[time=1253] And before you too quickly pass on that, I would invite you to consider your life song today.
[time=1261] It's true lyrics, what's really going on,
[time=1267] what you really need and the depths at which you need it.
[time=1271] And let me just encourage you with the scriptures.
[time=1275] Psalm 10710, it says that there were those
[time=1281] who dwelt in darkness and in the shadow of death prisoners in misery and chains because they had rebelled against the words of God and spurned the council of the most time.
[time=1298] Therefore, he humbled their heart with labor.
[time=1301] They stumbled and there was none to help.
[time=1305] Then they cried out.
[time=1309] And they cried out to the Lord in their trouble.
[time=1314] He saved them out of their distress as he brought them out of darkness in the shadow of death and broke their bands apart.
[time=1323] For those who he did that for,
[time=1329] here in the text and for those in this room, verse 15 says, let them give what?
[time=1334] Let them give thanks.
[time=1336] Let them give thanks to the Lord for his loving kindness and for his wonders to the sons of men.
[time=1344] Says in Psalm 5, give ear to my words, O Lord,
[time=1352] consider my groaning.
[time=1357] Many of you in the room this morning may be at a place of private personal groaning.
[time=1364] It's that sound, it's that feeling.
[time=1368] It's what comes out when you're not sure what to say.
[time=1373] The hurt is deep, the confusion broad, the helplessness and the hopelessness mounting.
[time=1381] Consider David says, my groaning.
[time=1387] Heed the sound of my cry for help, my king and my God, for to you I pray.
[time=1392] I thought it was interesting.
[time=1394] As you study Psalm 5, you realize that the phrase, the sound of my cry for help and for to you I pray, the sound of my cry and my prayer, there are synonymous.
[time=1406] So many times we feel like our prayers need to be
[time=1413] ordered and together.
[time=1417] Amen, and hear the psalmist says, just cry, just cry out and allow your desperation
[time=1428] and your longing to be heard and seen for to you I pray.
[time=1433] In the morning, O Lord, you will hear my voice.
[time=1437] In the morning, I will order my prayer to you and eagerly watch.
[time=1444] Psalm 6, 2, be gracious to me.
[time=1448] O Lord, for I am pining away, wasting away, shriveling away, fading away, heal me.
[time=1459] O Lord, for my bones are dismayed and my soul is greatly dismayed, but you O Lord, how long return O Lord rescue
[time=1475] my soul?
[time=1475] Save me because of your loving kindness.
[time=1480] I believe there are many in the room this morning.
[time=1487] I can identify what the psalmist says here in verse six.
[time=1491] I am weary with my sighing.
[time=1495] Every night I make my bed swim, I dissolve my couch with my tears.
[time=1505] My eye has wasted away with grief that has become old because of my adversaries.
[time=1511] Depart from me, all you who do iniquity, for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.
[time=1518] The Lord has heard my supplication.
[time=1522] The Lord receives my prayer.
[time=1526] All my enemies will be ashamed and greatly dismayed.
[time=1532] They shall turn back, they will suddenly be ashamed.
[time=1537] Says in Psalm nine, verse nine,
[time=1544] "The Lord also will be a stronghold for the oppressed, "a stronghold in times of trouble, "and those God who know your name "will put their trust in you for you O Lord,
[time=1562] "have not forsaken those who seek you." Oh, what a great truth.
[time=1569] He has not.
[time=1570] He is not and he will never forsake those who seek him.
[time=1577] And then there is that great, great truth from Revelation 21.
[time=1589] It speaks to the reality of what will transpire someday, and yet it brings great hope to many of us in the day-to-day of now.
[time=1599] And I heard a loud voice, Revelation 21.3.
[time=1605] A loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, "and he will dwell among them, "and they shall be his people, "and when God himself will be among them, "and he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, "and there will no longer be any death, "there will no longer be any mourning, "or crying or pain.
[time=1635] "For these things, these first things, have passed away.
[time=1640] "And he who sits on the throne said, "Behold, "I am making all things, what?
[time=1649] "Say it, Church, new.
[time=1651] "I am making all things new." And he said, "Right, for these words are faithful and true." Father in Heaven, what a privilege,
[time=1668] what an honor to be able to with these dear friends
[time=1675] who I love and appreciate so much, many of whom I've known for years, others I've met in recent days, but nonetheless it is a joy to be able to remind them and their hearts and their souls and their lives of the reality of your great love and your faithfulness, your desire to make things new, to rescue, to provide strong holds, to give hope and encouragement.
[time=1706] And so, God, I pray that your spirit and your word would do that here in this moment.
[time=1711] In your son's name, we pray.
[time=1716] [AMEN] Thanks, Corbin.
[time=1723] Thank you for letting me do that for you.
[time=1726] So it's very possible that you're here this morning in a tough spot to some degree, again, a thousand different circumstances and a thousand different situations that you're here and you're in a tough place.
[time=1743] And as you sit here this morning, you hear from the word of God, mostly maybe a little bit from me, that God not only is able, but desires to do something new in you, something new in your life.
[time=1758] After all, he is a God who redeems.
[time=1760] I hope you'll write these things down.
[time=1762] After all, he is a God who redeems.
[time=1766] You know that, right?
[time=1769] You could expect and you could look for and you could anticipate him doing a new thing in you because he is a God who redeems.
[time=1778] Galatians 4, I think, will come on the screen.
[time=1781] I love what it says there, especially at this season, but when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth his son, born of a woman, born under the law, and then it says right there in verse five, so that he might redeem those who were under the law that we might receive the adoption as sons.
[time=1800] You say, okay, I think I know what that means, but just remind me, so let me remind you.
[time=1805] He is a God who redeems, right?
[time=1808] Hosea, this won't be on the screen.
[time=1810] I could give you the paraphrase, but I think it might even be better just to read it to you.
[time=1815] Let me read this to you.
[time=1816] Hosea is where you get the greatest, most powerful, unbelievable picture of the redeeming nature of God.
[time=1824] The redeeming nature of God gets to kind of be lived out in the person of Hosea as Hosea kind of makes his way down this path that God lays out for him.
[time=1834] If you remember in Hosea 1, God says, go marry a prostitute.
[time=1837] Go marry a prostitute and then you're marrying the prostitute.
[time=1843] I am going to illustrate through your faithfulness to her my faithfulness to my people who have prostituted themselves with other gods and other nations.
[time=1854] And so Hosea goes and marries Gomer, real lady, real harlot, marries her, faithful to her, they have a son.
[time=1865] She cheats like crazy on him.
[time=1867] She continues to be a prostitute.
[time=1869] She continues to sleep with other men.
[time=1873] She walks down that road, it leads to all the loneliness and hurt and destruction that it leads to.
[time=1880] And then God says, you're going to go save her from that life of prostitution again and you're going to take her for yourself a second time.
[time=1890] Listen, Hosea 3, then the Lord said to me, go again, love a woman who was loved by her husband yet an adulterous, even as the Lord loves the sons of Israel.
[time=1898] Though they turned to other gods and love raising cakes.
[time=1901] So I bought her for myself.
[time=1905] The picture there would be a slave auction.
[time=1909] She has so dwindled, she has so traveled down the road.
[time=1913] She has so spent herself physically and literally but now she's good for nothing.
[time=1922] Now she's just at the end of her rope standing on a slave auction block in chains and probably no clothes being sold to whoever might bid something.
[time=1937] And there she is in all of her disgrace and shame.
[time=1940] And I just want to read that phrase to you again.
[time=1943] So I bought her for myself.
[time=1947] That phrase bought her is the Hebrew word redeemed.
[time=1955] And it's what he does.
[time=1958] Our God is a God who buys us back from the depths of our despair to show his faithfulness to those who are so unfaithful.
[time=1968] You sit here this morning in need of a new day and a fresh start and the clarity that comes from forgiveness.
[time=1975] And I want to remind you, you should be expected and you should be looking for that from him.
[time=1980] He is a God who after all, redeems.
[time=1983] I hope you wrote that down.
[time=1984] He is also a God who restores.
[time=1986] Instead of Psalm 51, sorry upstairs, just you don't have to put anything up right now.
[time=1993] I want to just turn real quick.
[time=1995] I want to read this to you Psalm 80.
[time=1997] It says in Psalm 80 verse three.
[time=2002] Oh God, the Psalmist cries out, oh God restore us and cause your face to shine upon us and we will be saved.
[time=2010] It says in verse seven, oh God of hosts restore us and cause your face to shine upon us and we will be saved.
[time=2018] It says in verse 19 of Psalm 80.
[time=2020] Oh Lord God of hosts restore us.
[time=2024] Cause your face to shine upon us and we will be saved here.
[time=2028] The Psalmist states what is obviously the obvious to him that he's praying and crying out to a God who he knows can restore to bring back to a place of newness, to restore, to bring what is worn out, to bring what is broken back to a place of newness.
[time=2046] He makes all things new.
[time=2047] He redeems, he buys back, he restores, he makes new.
[time=2051] And you're sitting here this morning going, you know what Kelly, I appreciate that, but I think I'm beyond redemption.
[time=2061] I think I'm beyond being restored.
[time=2067] Oh, I thought you might say that so I've got a third R for you that trumps your clearly difficult position.
[time=2076] Psalm 119, 37, even those who think you are beyond hope, turn away my eyes from looking at vanity and what?
[time=2086] Say it and revive, bring back from the dead.
[time=2096] That's what that word means, revive me.
[time=2098] He wants to redeem, he really does.
[time=2104] He wants to make all things new in your life.
[time=2107] He wants to restore, he wants to revive our God as a God who wants to do and can do all of that.
[time=2115] So, in the time that we've got left, let me give you three things you need to do as you enter a new year.
[time=2127] Anybody sense anything weird there?
[time=2130] Raise your hand if you just felt a little something weird there when I said that.
[time=2135] Anybody gonna be okay, good, yeah, I see a few.
[time=2137] First hour, there was a lot.
[time=2140] Okay, let me try it again.
[time=2143] He really wants to do all that.
[time=2145] He really can.
[time=2146] God wants to restore and redeem and revive you.
[time=2150] He wants to make things new.
[time=2155] So here are three things I want you to do.
[time=2157] First hour, they're going, wait a minute.
[time=2162] Like you said, he wanted to do these things.
[time=2165] And now you're gonna give us things to do.
[time=2168] I don't know how much you wrestle with this.
[time=2174] I don't know how much this is on your mind at times.
[time=2177] But I do wanna give you three things to do as we head toward a new year and three things I really think you should consider and three things I think you should really give some thought to.
[time=2187] But everything I just said about him is as true as the day is long.
[time=2192] You see, here's what we bump into at times and here's what we come to this morning, Philippians 2.12.
[time=2198] Come on, let me hear your pages turn there.
[time=2200] Go back in your New Testament to Philippians.
[time=2202] Paul's letter to the church at Philippi.
[time=2205] It says in Philippians 2.12, very clear, very certain terms, so then my beloved.
[time=2213] He says, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[time=2229] There's a lot going on in Philippi.
[time=2231] There's a lot taking place.
[time=2234] These folks are in the heat of it.
[time=2237] Paul's trying to help them understand how this faith thing works out, how the church is to function, and so his word to them is work out your salvation.
[time=2248] Work it out with fear and trembling.
[time=2253] It's a very bold and very clear phrase in the Greek.
[time=2257] It means to constantly, you can write this down, the verb workout means to constantly expend effort, both mentally and physically, to bring something to fulfillment or completion.
[time=2270] This is interesting, think about it.
[time=2272] He's talking about your salvation and the phrase he uses in the Greek is the one that talks about bringing something to completion, bringing something to fulfillment.
[time=2284] Biblically, you and I are to work out our salvation, not work to get our salvation, right?
[time=2293] That's not what it says, no.
[time=2296] The way the text reads, work out the salvation you already possess, but nonetheless it needs to be by you, according to the text, work out you.
[time=2307] It's consistent with Paul's writings.
[time=2313] If you just go a flip over a page or two, go to Philippians 3.13, you see the same wording, you sense the same spirit, you see the same phrase, theology, brethren, I do not regard verse 13, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet, but one thing I, what say, do, forgetting what lies behind, reaching forward to what lies ahead, I verse 14, I press on toward the goal.
[time=2338] One author said it this way, this working out is the responsibility of the Christ follower to be actively and faithfully in pursuit of a humble, there's the fear and trembling, of a humble obedience to God and his word.
[time=2358] A humble obedience, it's characteristic of the context of Philippians 2.12, where before 2.12, we see the kenosis, we see the emptying of Christ, Christ not considering equality with God, a thing to be held onto, but he empties himself in humility and obedience to God.
[time=2376] And with that same humility and obedience, we are to be a people who work it out.
[time=2384] Spiritual health, spiritual blessing, spiritual growth, isn't which three times and click your heels.
[time=2390] Spiritual growth, spiritual blessing isn't, it isn't lazy, undisciplined, indulgent, meets up with divine and boom, he makes everything better just like that.
[time=2409] Work out your salvation, the text says.
[time=2413] My friends, this is sleeves rolled up really high.
[time=2420] This is high cost, high stakes,
[time=2427] intentional thought through obedience.
[time=2432] And it wasn't just to the church at Philippi, go back, if you would go to 1 Corinthians 9, she's turned back there quickly.
[time=2439] You see the same verbiage, you see the same phraseology, there's the same spirit in what he writes.
[time=2445] 1 Corinthians 9, 26, therefore he says, I run in such a way in 24, he said, run in such a way that you may win.
[time=2452] 26, therefore I run, Paul says, in such a way as not without aim, the word run there in the Greek is synonymous for the word used for training.
[time=2463] Here he talks about athletic training, and here he talks about athletic training at the highest most elite level.
[time=2469] So just picture in your mind those who would in that day or those who would in ours, train at the highest most elite physical levels.
[time=2477] And he says, this is how I run, not physically, but spiritually, I run in such a way as not without aim, I box in such a way as not beating the air, but I discipline my body and make it my slave.
[time=2493] Work it out, this one thing I do.
[time=2497] It's the embracing of anything and anyone.
[time=2505] It's your willingness in mind to embrace anything or anyone that leads to spiritual health and obedience.
[time=2511] And it is the casting aside of anything or anyone that doesn't.
[time=2515] Got a new year ahead of you and he says, work it out.
[time=2524] Okay, but it's not all he says.
[time=2528] It's challenging and in some ways as inspiring as verse 12 can be, you and I also know that if it's just left to you and I doing our best to work something out, it's gonna what?
[time=2541] It's gonna fail, look at verse 13.
[time=2543] And I love it that it's just a verse later.
[time=2544] He says, all of that, work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is God who is at what?
[time=2551] I'll say it, work for it is God who is at work in you.
[time=2556] You have gotta work it out.
[time=2560] You have got to be willing to take the discipline steps to what did it say constantly be pursuing humble obedience?
[time=2568] And the next verse says for it is God who is at work in you,
[time=2576] both to will and to work.
[time=2579] What a great phrase.
[time=2581] You understand that for it is God who is at work in the life of a fully surrendered follower of Christ.
[time=2589] The scripture teaches us here that it is God at work.
[time=2592] It's God who's even tweaking your will.
[time=2594] When you get up in the morning or you go to bed at night or in the midst of your day to day, when you have those leanings and those desires to do the right thing, don't think for a moment that's you.
[time=2607] For it is God who is at work even to will and to work.
[time=2612] He provides you and I with that desire.
[time=2616] He provides you and I with that will and the ability to work out our salvation for his good pleasure.
[time=2625] There's a lot of this truth, a lot of this teaching in Philippians on the verse 13, God at work side.
[time=2632] I'll take you back to one six where it says, for I am confident of this very thing that he who began a good what?
[time=2639] For he who began a good work in you will perfect it.
[time=2643] He will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.
[time=2647] So who's working?
[time=2650] You are God, is it you?
[time=2652] Say yes.
[time=2653] Is it God?
[time=2655] Say yes.
[time=2657] Yeah.
[time=2657] Ultimately, most importantly him, energizing and bringing strength and courage to your efforts that you choose to do on a regular basis constantly and faithfully in pursuit.
[time=2670] I love how this sounds.
[time=2675] This one thing you do, listen, this one thing you do from a place of helpless trust in a God who has promised to do it.
[time=2684] Amen?
[time=2686] Okay, so here's the three things.
[time=2689] And this is really an exercise for you to do.
[time=2691] Here's the three things I want you to think this week about doing in 2011.
[time=2696] If you just pull out your insert, kind of that tall, skinny insert there.
[time=2702] 2011 with help from God and others.
[time=2705] I will, here's the three things I want you to consider doing.
[time=2707] I want you to consider stopping some things.
[time=2711] I'd love for you to consider starting some things and I'd love to see you continue.
[time=2717] I think God would love to see you continue in some things that you've begun in recent days.
[time=2722] Now, understand from the beginning, unless you do something with this that's highly personal and highly transparent unless you do something with this that includes others, unless this ends up in your accountability coffee meeting this week, unless this ends up in your small group, I mean, unless this ends up you interacting with these things, with others who love you, unless this ends up somehow in dialogue and discussion and unless this ends up in community, then it's a waste of paper and let's go home.
[time=2759] But if you're willing to do something with this, I think it could be really, really healthy.
[time=2766] I mean, if I just ask you the question, just asking you the question this morning, what is it in the days to come you really need to stop doing?
[time=2775] God wants to help you.
[time=2778] God promises He'll give you strength and direction to move that way, but on the you front, what are some things you need to, you must stop doing?
[time=2789] And I want you to, you know what I did, I talked to about 10, 12 people in the last week and a half, a little focus group.
[time=2797] I just started talking to people about these things.
[time=2802] And I got back some information, added some of my own thoughts, my own realities to this, and so I've got a few things written out here.
[time=2809] I'll share those, but I just want you to write really small because I'd love for you to write some things down.
[time=2816] From your life, from the reality of your day to day, where your life song is today, I'd love for you to fill in the blanks, I think it could be really, really healthy.
[time=2828] Here's a few things I came across as I talked with others about what we should stop.
[time=2833] Number one, small compromises.
[time=2835] I think you should write that down, small letters.
[time=2838] I think you and I should stop with small, tiny, little, seemingly sort of insignificant
[time=2849] things that might feel like they're a little wrong.
[time=2853] Maybe back up, if you're considering a major compromise,
[time=2859] I would encourage you to back away from the cliff.
[time=2862] But for the moment, here this morning, I just want you to think about the small ones, the small ones that lead to the cliff.
[time=2869] And I just ask you to think about some small compromises.
[time=2874] I was reminded of Daniel, as I thought this through this week.
[time=2878] I was thinking about Daniel one, Daniel and the other three young men.
[time=2884] Those kids that ended up being shadwrack me sack and have been to go, you know, them and probably four to 500 others were exported from Israel to Babylon and put under the tyrannical rule of this guy named Nebuchadnezzar, who wanted to destroy these young men, destroy them in terms of their past and their heritage and their faith.
[time=2902] He says to them, I want you to teach these boys a new education, I want you to teach them a new language, I want you to change their names.
[time=2912] Oh, no, yeah, I want you to feed them my food.
[time=2915] Many of you remember the story.
[time=2918] I mean, these kids are probably in fear of their life.
[time=2921] But Daniel steps up and says, you know what?
[time=2923] Change my name, go right ahead, teach me whatever you want to teach me, send me to whatever school you want to send me to, but I'm not going to eat that food.
[time=2932] And you and I could in that situation say it's just food, it's just this little thing, shut up, he's crazy, he'll kill you, he'll have your head.
[time=2941] It wasn't a little thing to him because he knew God had prescribed a diet for him.
[time=2947] And though it might seem a small thing to him, it was a huge thing and he knew where it might lead and I would encourage you this morning, I would remind you this morning, it always leads somewhere, always.
[time=2962] As I talked with people, it was interesting to hear them talk about small compromises.
[time=2969] Stop making excuses for your sin, something to consider.
[time=2975] I heard it several times, husbands.
[time=2983] Wives, kids, employees, stop making excuses.
[time=2988] I know your list is long, mine can be too.
[time=3001] I know it's even legit to a certain degree in terms of clear frustration or a just cause.
[time=3013] Stop making excuses.
[time=3015] Several folks who I talked with talked about, stop making excuses for your sin.
[time=3022] James one says that when you're tempted,
[time=3028] don't say God's tempting me.
[time=3031] In other words, don't try and pawn it off on someone else.
[time=3034] It goes on to say that we're tempted and we sin when we're carried away by our own what?
[time=3038] Lust, ours, nobody else's.
[time=3043] Our own desires, our own demands, our own lust leads to sin.
[time=3049] Sin brings forth death.
[time=3052] Stop small compromises, stop making excuses.
[time=3058] Stop settling for a spiritual 2.0, when so many times in so many areas, I know many of you, in many areas of your life, I watch you, you're 4.0, you're like A students on all fronts.
[time=3073] But then somehow it comes to this and we can settle in for a nice C plus.
[time=3078] Raise your hand if that sounds familiar.
[time=3081] Come on, be honest.
[time=3082] Just some things to think about.
[time=3085] Write those down small.
[time=3086] You may have another whole list.
[time=3088] Just God might be right now.
[time=3089] It might be brewing in your heart.
[time=3090] The Spirit might be leading you to just boldly and courageously write some things down.
[time=3095] What should you stop doing?
[time=3098] With help from God and others.
[time=3103] In the year to come.
[time=3104] What should you start doing?
[time=3109] Here's one to consider.
[time=3110] James 516 says to confess your sin one to another.
[time=3114] James 516 says that healing comes in community is deep and it's strengthened when you and I are willing to, in appropriate ways, in appropriate settings, confess our sin, our failure to each other.
[time=3128] Appropriate ways, in appropriate settings, you might consider deepening your relationship with those in your world and bringing into the light things that need help and encouragement.
[time=3140] Confession, confessional living.
[time=3142] Here's one for you.
[time=3145] I think many of you maybe could use this encouragement and I mean this, I mean this, I mean this.
[time=3150] We are willing to help you with this in any way, shape, or form we can.
[time=3154] Start meeting with other couples.
[time=3156] Start meeting with other groups of friends.
[time=3158] Start meeting with just one other person.
[time=3162] To spend time each week together praying for each other and going through that week's digging deeper from our website, digging deeper.
[time=3170] It's a resource tool that we make available to everybody online.
[time=3174] It allows you to take the message from Sunday and continue to discuss it and study it and further apply it to your life.
[time=3182] I know people who use it weekly personally.
[time=3184] I know small groups that use it on a regular basis.
[time=3187] Maybe for you in the year to come you should immediately come January 1, start thinking about who you can meet with.
[time=3194] To pray together and begin to go through that week's digging deeper.
[time=3199] Talk to several folks who talked about wanting to start a regular time of personal prayer and Bible reading.
[time=3208] What a great, great thing to begin to do.
[time=3211] In the morning, noon, night, whenever that works for you, a personal time of prayer and Bible reading would love to help you with that.
[time=3220] Would love to encourage you.
[time=3221] We've got resources that could help you do that.
[time=3224] And what should you continue?
[time=3231] So, encouraged by those I spoke with who talked about
[time=3241] how in recent months, maybe even in this last year, a couple of them in this last year, they had started to serve.
[time=3248] They began to, as a family, like mom and dad and some kids.
[time=3254] And then another one I spoke with was a single gal who began to do it with some other folks in her small community.
[time=3260] And they just have started to serve.
[time=3262] Outside these four walls, specifically those in need.
[time=3268] And there's all kinds of ways they've learned to find out where those needs are and how they can meet them and how they can do that as a family and how they can do it once a week.
[time=3278] And they've carved time out of their life to make it a priority to be priests who pass along God to others.
[time=3286] His graciousness, his kindness, his service.
[time=3289] Others have started serving inside these four walls.
[time=3293] Some of you have stopped.
[time=3296] I don't know why.
[time=3299] I'm in some cases I do and many cases I don't.
[time=3301] Maybe for you, it's a time for you to re-engage, to roll up your serving sleeves and make an investment in a junior high student or a high school student or a four year old down the hall.
[time=3313] Thankful for those who have started serving and would pray that you would continue to do so.
[time=3320] Others have talked about giving and how this year was a turning point for them and they finally began to give sacrificially.
[time=3326] They finally began to give on a regular basis.
[time=3329] They finally began to give first, Proverbs 3.
[time=3333] They started to give first, not crumbs on the 30th, but right off the top at the beginning of the month, the check got written, first fruits, that whole principle, people talking with me and sharing with me what a difference that's made in their life and their hearts and their understanding and their view of God and his provision.
[time=3354] I hope you'll fill this out.
[time=3357] I really do.
[time=3358] I hope you'll take some time today.
[time=3359] I hope you'll share it with a good friend.
[time=3360] I hope you'll talk about it maybe as a family.
[time=3363] And I hope in the days to come as 2011 rolls around that with God's help and with the help and encouragement of others you could begin to do, the working out of your salvation in relationship with a God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
[time=3382] [AMEN] Father in heaven, we stand hopeful
[time=3390] and wanting the word of God and the truth of what we've seen here in your scriptures this morning to be revealed and applied to our lives.
[time=3399] So many of us in this room in need of stopping and starting and continuing.
[time=3405] And God, I pray that the spirit of God would in a powerful way intervene.
[time=3412] Oh God, I pray that your spirit would speak to us and move in our thinking and in our interaction privately and with others about these things, about this little sheet of paper.
[time=3423] It's just a sheet of paper, but God, there may be things on that sheet of paper that need to be there, that are crucial for our spiritual formation and our development as disciples and followers of your son.
[time=3437] So God, I pray that our hearts and our minds would be open.
[time=3441] I pray that you would be at work, both to will and to work for your good pleasure.
[time=3447] Oh God, I pray that we would be humble, that we would find ourselves readily and often in a posture of humble obedience and receptiveness to what it is you want us to do.
[time=3462] God, may we lead excuses behind and may we step forward to do this one thing that you yourself have promised to do.
[time=3472] What a sweet union, what a great picture.
[time=3476] We love you, we commit ourselves to you again.
[time=3479] We look forward to being together soon if that be your will.
[time=3483] And we say all this and we claim all this in your son's name and all the people agreed and said, "Hey man, God bless you." (upbeat music)
[time=3506] (upbeat music)
