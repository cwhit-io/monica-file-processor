[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It's great to have you with us.
[time=36] And I'm so thankful for this time when we can share with you things that God is doing, not only here at Blackhawk, but things God is doing around Blackhawk and in our community.
[time=47] You know as well as I do that we've got a real heart for not just our church, but the church of Fort Wayne and this region and it's a joy periodically to be able to share with you ministries that we're aware of that are really, really doing their very best with God's help to teach the scriptures and care for people and come alongside folks in the discipling process and minister to families.
[time=72] And whenever I find them, we want to just do our best to tell you about them.
[time=76] And I'm really thankful to have pastor Stuart Cruz with me today.
[time=81] Hey, Stu.
[time=81] - How are you?
[time=82] - I'm good, man.
[time=83] It's good to see you.
[time=84] Thank you for coming.
[time=85] - Thanks for having us.
[time=86] - Stuart Cruz, you may recognize the name of the way I like to say it.
[time=89] Mitchell Cruz is Stuart's brother.
[time=91] - That's right.
[time=92] - And we appreciate so much the ministry that Mitchell has had here at Blackhawk, but most of you may not know Stuart is a senior pastor in there at County Line Church of God on County Line Road out there in Auburn.
[time=105] And I'm really grateful for what God is doing through Stuart and that team and that family out in that area.
[time=113] Stuart, why don't we just start by you kind of talking about how it is you first joined the staff there at County Line, how you first got involved in ministry in that setting.
[time=124] When did that happen?
[time=124] How did it happen?
[time=126] - Well, as you mentioned, I used to be involved in the collector car auction business with my family.
[time=130] And there was a point in the late 90s where I decided, you know, I think now's a good time to break away and pursue what I felt God was placing on my heart for a long time and that was ministry.
[time=142] So I started taking some classes and that kind of thing.
[time=144] And I had a real heart for my home church because our family heritage went all the way back to the beginning of the church.
[time=151] And it's been there now over 113 years.
[time=153] So, you know, I had this desire.
[time=156] I want to be at County Line, but I, you know, I don't know if that's a right thing or a wrong thing to be desiring that.
[time=161] And a professor I had, I talked to him about it and he said, you can't put God in a box.
[time=168] If you want to serve him through the ministry, you have to serve him with an open hand and say, I'll go, wherever you want me to go.
[time=173] And I said, all right.
[time=174] So I examined my heart and I said, God, I feel you calling me into ministry.
[time=178] So if it's at County Line, great, if it's not, that's okay, I'll go wherever you want.
[time=183] Not long after that, our senior pastor at the church had a heart attack and had to resign and retire, I guess.
[time=191] And they knew I was pursuing ministry.
[time=195] And so they came to me and said, would you like to come on as the associate pastor?
[time=199] And I said, yeah.
[time=200] So for it to work out like that, the church I grew up in was a little unique.
[time=206] So I was the associate pastor there for about.
[time=209] - And when did that take place?
[time=210] - That would have been 2001.
[time=212] - Okay.
[time=213] - Yep.
[time=214] And served as the associate pastor there under Bob Herman for nine years or so?
[time=221] - Yeah.
[time=221] - And then Bob unfortunately had a stroke and it was neat to serve with him because he had a big impact on my life.
[time=227] He was my youth pastor there.
[time=229] And I gave my heart to Christ through his ministry there.
[time=232] So it was neat to serve with him.
[time=234] We were good friends.
[time=234] And so it was hard to see him have that stroke and then try to recover.
[time=238] And then it just got to a point where he felt like it was time to resign and let the church move forward, I guess.
[time=245] And so then they voted me in as the senior pastor shortly after that.
[time=249] And that's where I'm at today.
[time=251] - That's great.
[time=252] And when did that happen?
[time=253] You becoming senior pastor?
[time=255] - It was official back in April of this year.
[time=257] - Okay, good.
[time=259] Well, I know Stuart and I have talked about this and I've talked about it with other pastors.
[time=263] It's kind of a fun thing.
[time=265] We're all involved in ministry.
[time=268] God's given us opportunities to be involved in great churches.
[time=272] And we're all doing the same thing.
[time=274] I think most people understand that.
[time=276] Fundamentally at our core, we're all doing the same thing.
[time=279] And yet in different churches, in different demographics, in different parts of a community here or there, it's funny how we all say it differently.
[time=289] We all have kind of unique ways of saying what we believe our unique mission is in that specific setting.
[time=295] And I know that God has put on your heart and on the heart of your team and that family at County Line, kind of a unique calling.
[time=303] There are some things you sense God doing and some opportunities.
[time=308] I know you sense God calling you too in that community there at County Line.
[time=312] Tell our people who are watching what you guys are about these days at County Line, Church of God.
[time=318] - Well, our staff went on to a conference and at this conference, one of the guys that got upset, if your church were to close its doors tomorrow, would anybody in the community protest?
[time=330] Are you such a vital part of your community that people would protest?
[time=333] If you said we can't, we have to cease to exist.
[time=336] - Wow.
[time=337] - And we were sitting there thinking, I'm not sure they would.
[time=339] You know, they might say, "Oh, that's too bad," but I don't think they'd protest.
[time=342] - Might not be a revolt.
[time=343] - Yeah, so we started looking at that.
[time=345] And one of the unique situations we have is we're kind of in a rural setting, as you mentioned, we're on the Allen D. Cobb County Line.
[time=352] So we're not in an urban setting where the needs of the people are just right outside our door.
[time=358] So we really had to start looking for that.
[time=360] And so I started interviewing the different community leaders in the Auburn area just to start there and talk to school superintendent and mayor and principals of schools and the sheriff and anybody I could think of and just ask them, what are the major problems in our community?
[time=381] And so we started setting for some ministries in that regard.
[time=384] We changed our mission statement to restoring our communities with Christ one life at a time.
[time=389] - Oh, that's great.
[time=390] - And our idea there was we wanted our people to understand that restoring our communities seems like a monster.
[time=396] But if we focus on that one life at a time that God brings into our path in any given day, in a given moment that each of us doing our part, doing a ministry outside the walls of the church, we can accomplish great things.
[time=410] And what's really been neat is it was nice talking about that, but for it to become a reality was another thing.
[time=417] And here recently, things have just been coming to us like crazy where we've been through just unique relationships.
[time=424] We've been able to develop a sister church relationship in Bulgaria, in Germany, in Africa.
[time=432] So we have that thing going on with restoring communities, not only where we're at, but around the world.
[time=438] And then locally, we're working on a food pantry idea.
[time=441] We're working on reaching a mobile home park in our area.
[time=446] We have maybe an orphanage thing we're working on.
[time=450] So it's just all of a sudden, these things started to come into place.
[time=453] And what's been really exciting is watching individuals in the church discover their gifts, their passions, and using those outside the walls of the church to help restore people's lives and not just be within our own holy huddle, as they say.
[time=468] We're all inside together and just oblivious to what's happening around us, so.
[time=473] - That's cool, that's really cool.
[time=475] One thing I know you're very aware of, and one thing that Stuart and I believe deeply is that you might be an urban church, you may be in the suburbs, you might be on county line, you could be in Bulgaria or in Nairobi.
[time=490] Wherever we are, we know that there are people who need the hope and the help that the gospel can bring.
[time=496] And I'm so grateful for Stuart, and I'm thankful for his team.
[time=500] I've listened to Stuart teach.
[time=502] He is thorough, he's practical, he's helpful.
[time=506] God is using him and that team to do a great thing in that community, and we're really thankful for it.
[time=512] We want you to know about it.
[time=513] We do this because there are those of you who watch this broadcast, and I know you're thankful for Blackcock, but county line church of God and Auburn may be right in your backyard.
[time=523] You may be close enough to go and check them out and meet Stuart, and we want you to know, here on the bottom third of the screen, you'll see some website information.
[time=532] There'll be a telephone number that you can call, and I know Stuart, I know his team, they would love to meet you, and they'd love to help you and encourage you in whatever way possible.
[time=541] So, Stuart, thanks for what you're doing.
[time=543] Thanks for being faithful at it, and thank you for tuning in.
[time=547] As always, it's great to have you with us, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=550] Somebody wrote recently, America is spinning out of control.
[time=557] I would tend to agree.
[time=560] Just look at the facts, they write.
[time=562] Individuals, companies, and our government continue to amass huge financial debts that cannot be repaid.
[time=572] Our markets collapsed recently, did an unfounded speculation, and the overextension of credit to people who never should have been lent money.
[time=581] We're overweight, we're under disciplined, over entertained, over medicated, while many of our relationships are strained and quickly moving toward being shattered.
[time=592] We are an anxious people.
[time=595] We lose patience quickly on all fronts, and we've multitasked and overextended ourselves to the point that we're losing our ability to think and make clear and healthy decisions.
[time=606] We live, this author said, in an age, my friends, of excess.
[time=612] Excessive consumption, excessive expectations and greed.
[time=618] We suffer from cultural narcissism, and our drive for more, for bigger and for better, is leaving in its wake the broken dreams, hearts, broken homes, and futures of many, end quote.
[time=635] This may be a shock to you, it may not be,
[time=642] but I want you to just consider some of what I found in recent weeks on this idea of excess.
[time=651] The United States now has 2.3 billion square feet of storage space, 2.3 billion square feet of self-storage space here in our country.
[time=665] Less than 4% of the world's children are American, and yet American kids consume more than 40% of the world's toys.
[time=674] 77% of American teenagers have their own cell phone, using it to send or receive an average, an average of 191 calls, and 2,900 text messages every month.
[time=691] It's about 100 text messages every day.
[time=694] Some of you are laughing because you're above average.
[time=700] Then I do want to remind you that basically 3,000 text messages,
[time=706] that's the average, it's the average.
[time=710] America discards 694 plastic bottles every second,
[time=717] or 60 million plastic bottles each day.
[time=721] It made me think a lot of things, not the least of which is somebody's really wealthy.
[time=728] Whoever's making plastic bottles, probably doing okay.
[time=732] 4 million people could be fed, 4 million people could be fed, 4 million people who aren't being fed, 4 million could be fed each day, if just 5% of the food Americans waste each day was used or diverted toward the hungry.
[time=750] Hours per year, the average American youth
[time=757] spends in school, 900, hours per year, the average American youth spends watching television 1500.
[time=767] This was staggering.
[time=771] Young people now devote an average of seven hours and 38 minutes a day to media use.
[time=779] About 53 hours a week, more than a full-time job to TV, movies, Facebook, texting, phones, seven and a half hours a day.
[time=789] According to Conde Nast's American Wedding Survey, the average American wedding cost is $28,000 for a grand total of 161 billion each year spent
[time=803] on tooth whitening personalized M&Ms, monogram bridesmaids, tracksuits, favors for every guest and of course plastic surgery to look great on your most special of days.
[time=814] Somebody else wrote that, I didn't.
[time=819] So let me ask you a question.
[time=822] You know, I'll ask you this question first, you do understand that I could just read and read and read and read, you know I could just go on and on and on with the data and the statistics that bring to light your and mine our excessive behavior, right?
[time=843] I could just read all day long.
[time=847] Question for you, where does this propensity toward excess come from?
[time=852] Where does this leaning in you?
[time=856] Where does this propensity toward extreme living, where does this excessiveness come from?
[time=866] When you look at all that I just read and when you look at your life and when you look at mine, as I asked that question, there would be many I know in the room that would simply say that is Kelly for certain, that is our sinfulness showing itself, that is our bent toward materialism, they would say, all of this excessiveness comes from our fallen nature, our depravity, where does this propensity toward excess and lavishness come from?
[time=904] What if, what if I said to you this morning, what if I told you it came from God?
[time=913] What if I suggested to you this morning
[time=919] that it wasn't so much an indication of your fallen nature but an indication of your godly nature?
[time=927] Hang with me, I know I've confused half of you.
[time=934] Look at what it says in Genesis 1, 26.
[time=936] I hope you'll open your Bibles and turn there with me.
[time=939] Genesis 1, 26 and 27.
[time=944] Where does this propensity toward excess and lavishness come from?
[time=949] Is it from our sinful nature or might it be our godly nature?
[time=955] Let's look at this, it says in Genesis 1, 26, then God said, let us make man, I'll stop you right there, side note, and this is completely for free and separate from our discussion this morning, but I just noticed it again when I read it this week.
[time=969] Anybody in the room ever wanting to understand the validity of the triune godhead they taught us in school, the Trinity, the reality of God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit.
[time=984] What a great few words right here in 1, 26.
[time=987] Then God singular said, let who?
[time=992] Us, plural.
[time=994] Did you ever see that?
[time=996] It's amazing.
[time=997] Then God said, let us make man in whose image?
[time=1003] Our image, which is clear indication that God has image, that the Son has image, that the Spirit has image.
[time=1014] Let us make man in our plural image singular.
[time=1021] According to our likeness.
[time=1025] And let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.
[time=1033] Listen, God created man in his own image.
[time=1040] And in case you missed it, in the image of God, he God created man, him.
[time=1050] And he created the male and female.
[time=1052] He created them.
[time=1057] My friends, you were made, the scriptures teach us.
[time=1061] You were formed.
[time=1063] You were created by God in his image.
[time=1066] God made Adam to be like himself.
[time=1071] There's no vagueness here.
[time=1074] This isn't just an analogy.
[time=1077] This isn't figurative speech.
[time=1079] No, the fact is that when God made man, he wanted man to be just like him.
[time=1087] Man made in the image of God.
[time=1092] When the grandma sees the baby for the first time ever, she looks at her son and she looks at the baby and she says he's your spitting image.
[time=1101] He looks just like you.
[time=1104] What does this mean?
[time=1109] One commentator explained what it means is that man is a living being capable of embodying God's transferable attributes.
[time=1119] Grace, compassion, love, mercy, generosity, et cetera.
[time=1122] In his rational life, man was made like God in that he could reason and possessed intellect, personal will and emotion.
[time=1133] In the moral sense, he was like God because he was good and sinless originally.
[time=1138] So man, listen church, made by God
[time=1145] to be like God created in God's image.
[time=1153] So back to our question.
[time=1155] Where does our propensity toward excess and lavishness come from?
[time=1162] Maybe, I would suggest to you this morning, quite possibly, it comes from the one whose image we bear.
[time=1173] Let me do it this way.
[time=1178] Let me read to you.
[time=1182] Let me read to you a portion of scripture that many of you in the room are familiar with.
[time=1188] I want to invite you this morning to listen.
[time=1191] I want you to listen for this picture of God and the way he thinks and the way he envisions and the way he creates.
[time=1202] I want you to, as you listen to a very familiar story this morning, I want you to think about what it says about him.
[time=1212] And I'm gonna read this through and as I read, I invite you this morning to listen and to watch and to think about what this says about our God and his image, his nature, the way he is.
[time=1227] You ready?
[time=1228] Here we go.
[time=1231] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[time=1234] The earth was formless and void and darkness was over the surface of the deep and the spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters.
[time=1243] Then God said, let there be light and there was light.
[time=1246] God saw that the light was good and God separated the light from the darkness.
[time=1251] God called the light day and the darkness he called night and there was evening and there was morning, one day.
[time=1259] Then God said, let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters and let it separate the waters from the waters.
[time=1265] God made the expanse and separated the waters which were below the expanse from the waters which were, he separated the waters which were below the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse and it was so and God called the expanse heaven and there was evening and there was morning a second day.
[time=1283] Then God said, let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place and let the dry land appear and it was so.
[time=1291] God called the dry land earth and the gathering of the waters he called seas and God saw that it was good.
[time=1297] Then God said, let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit after their kind with seed in them and it was so.
[time=1308] The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind and trees bearing fruit with seed in them after their kind and God saw that it was good, there was evening and there was morning a third day.
[time=1323] Then God said, let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth and it was so.
[time=1343] God made the two great lights, the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night.
[time=1351] He made the stars as well.
[time=1353] God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth and to govern the day and the night and to separate the light from the darkness and God saw that it was good and there was evening, there was morning a fourth day.
[time=1367] Then God said, let the waters team with swarms of living creatures and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens.
[time=1376] God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves with which the waters swarmed after their kind and every winged bird after its kind and God saw that it was good.
[time=1391] God blessed them saying the animals, be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let birds multiply on the earth, there was evening and there was morning a fifth day.
[time=1401] Then God said, let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind and it was so.
[time=1412] God made the beasts of the earth after their kind and the cattle after their kind and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind and God saw that it was good.
[time=1423] And then God said, let us make man in our image.
[time=1426] According to our lightness and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, God created man in his own image.
[time=1440] In the image of God, he created him male and female.
[time=1444] He created them, God blessed them and God said to them, be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth, then God said, behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of the earth and every tree which has fruit yielding seed and it shall be food for you and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the sky and to everything that moves on the earth which has life.
[time=1478] I have given every green plant for food and it was so.
[time=1483] And God saw all that he had made and behold, it was very good and there was evening and there was morning the sixth day.
[time=1494] You see my friends from the beginning,
[time=1502] when you just go back and take it all in, from the beginning God went overboard, didn't he?
[time=1509] I mean, from the very beginning he didn't miss a thing.
[time=1514] From day one he was excessive, he was comprehensive, he was detailed, every base got covered, never held back at all, did he?
[time=1524] I mean, it was huge, it was magnificent, it was mind-boggling, it was small, it was unbelievable.
[time=1530] From the beginning, lavish and over the top.
[time=1534] And with respect to creation, excessive in the intricacy
[time=1541] and the beauty and the majesty.
[time=1543] This is our God and this depicts his nature,
[time=1549] the way he thinks, the way he functions and you and I were created, molded and shaped
[time=1559] to be like him.
[time=1563] Excessive in creation.
[time=1568] You know what, as you read the scriptures, you find that he was also excessive in his redemption, excessive in his offer and his delivering of salvation.
[time=1578] Turn back in your Bibles, if you would, to the New Testament.
[time=1580] Will you go back to the book of Ephesians, please?
[time=1583] Everybody just open up there.
[time=1585] Galatians, after first and second Corinthians, comes Galatians and then you'll find Ephesians.
[time=1591] Go to Ephesians chapter one, if you will.
[time=1596] I wanna read this to you, the excessiveness of God in redemption.
[time=1600] The lavishness of God in salvation.
[time=1603] I'll pick it up in verse five, where it says, "Speaking of God, he predestined us," God did, "to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to himself." How did he do this?
[time=1621] Why did he do this with what spirit did he do this?
[time=1624] According, it says in the text, "According to the kind intention of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us and the beloved.
[time=1636] In him, we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished on us in all wisdom and insight."
[time=1652] I want you to listen as we go back through just those few verses.
[time=1658] I want you to listen church as I take you back through there.
[time=1661] And I want you to listen for excessive language.
[time=1666] I want you to listen for extreme, over the top, lavish language.
[time=1672] Let's go back and just look at a few of those phrases.
[time=1676] It says there in verse five that he predestined us to adoption according to the kind intention of his will.
[time=1685] You might want to just underline that or make a note.
[time=1688] Write this down, according to the kind intention of his will, this phrase in the original language denotes something that brings extreme good pleasure.
[time=1700] It denotes something that brings extreme good pleasure,
[time=1706] kind intention.
[time=1707] This is what's going on as God brings redemption, his kind intention.
[time=1714] It says as the passage continues that he in verse six, it says that he freely bestowed to the praise and glory of his grace.
[time=1722] So with grace in view, which he freely bestowed on us.
[time=1729] The phrase there freely bestowed, again, write this down.
[time=1732] It's an overflowing offering without cost.
[time=1737] This is an overflowing, granting of grace.
[time=1741] This is that the truck of grace getting backed up to your soul and that thing coming up and that payload dropping and it's just never ending.
[time=1751] It just keeps getting poured in.
[time=1754] It just keeps getting deposited into your heart and soul and life.
[time=1759] This grace of God, especially at this point of redemption.
[time=1762] It's an overflowing offering without cost.
[time=1767] Where do we get without cost?
[time=1769] Freely bestowed.
[time=1774] The use of the word watch this, the use of the word free.
[time=1777] Think about this.
[time=1779] The use of the word free in and of itself implies it should have come with a great price.
[time=1785] It was so big, this grace.
[time=1791] It was so huge.
[time=1793] It was so expensive.
[time=1794] It was so extreme.
[time=1797] It should have cost a great deal.
[time=1799] But instead, no, it is out of the kind intention.
[time=1804] Freely bestowed, overflowing offering without cost.
[time=1809] This is interesting.
[time=1810] Again, note the excessive language according to the riches of his grace.
[time=1815] Do you see that?
[time=1816] Right there in verse seven, the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace.
[time=1825] Best way I've learned to illustrate this for you.
[time=1828] According to is different than out of, out of.
[time=1837] If I asked a millionaire to help us out with a project,
[time=1843] and the millionaire gave me $2,000, those $2,000,
[time=1850] when you really look at it in the context, $2,000 comes out of his riches.
[time=1859] But if I ask that same millionaire to help us with the project, and he gave us $750,000, this is this three quarters of a million dollars.
[time=1869] Now this is according to the riches of his grace.
[time=1874] $750,000 according to the riches of his grace.
[time=1878] It's commensurate with, make sense?
[time=1882] And you and I didn't get too grand from him.
[time=1886] No.
[time=1889] This grace that was freely bestowed, overflowing was according to the riches of his grace.
[time=1897] Commensurate with his wealth, an amount for you and me beyond description, rich grace.
[time=1906] It's scandalous.
[time=1908] It really is.
[time=1910] It's so much.
[time=1912] It's so free.
[time=1914] It's so needed.
[time=1915] It's so right.
[time=1916] It's so good.
[time=1919] Which he lavished, if that weren't enough.
[time=1923] Again, keep listening here for the excessive language, which he lavished on us.
[time=1929] Literally means he made excessive and abundant.
[time=1932] I'll say that again for you, those of you who are writing that down, which he lavished on us, that word literally means he made excessive and abundant toward us.
[time=1944] Our prodigal God, this God who gives and gives and gives, this God who was lavished and over the top, excessive in his creation, excessive in his redemptive efforts.
[time=1956] You know what?
[time=1957] One more thing I want you to see about him.
[time=1959] Excessive in his love.
[time=1961] Excessive in his love as well.
[time=1963] First John, chapter three.
[time=1965] Go back to the back of your New Testament.
[time=1969] It says in first John, chapter three, verse one, and you can see it said a little differently in a number of different translations.
[time=1977] You see there on the screen the King James.
[time=1979] Behold, that word behold there means whoa, stop.
[time=1982] Don't go any further.
[time=1983] Make sure you see this.
[time=1984] Don't miss this.
[time=1986] Make sure you understand this is a really, really big deal.
[time=1989] Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed.
[time=1995] There's the word right there.
[time=1997] Bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God.
[time=2001] You and I know we should be called something else.
[time=2004] You and I both know that we deserve to be called something far worse.
[time=2008] But now because of what has been lavished, because of what has been bestowed, because of what has been freely overflowingly given, we're called sons of God.
[time=2019] In the NIV it says it a little differently.
[time=2021] Behold, what manner?
[time=2022] See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God in the NAS.
[time=2032] In the NASB it says there's see how great of love the Father has bestowed.
[time=2036] See how great of love the Father has lavished, that we should be called children of God.
[time=2041] God is, listen, God is by nature, excessive.
[time=2051] Excessive in creation, excessive in redemption, excessive in His love, which is why I believe we are.
[time=2063] Stay with me here.
[time=2064] God is by nature, excessive.
[time=2066] We were created in the image or nature of God, which is why I believe we are to be excessive.
[time=2071] It's why we are, it's why the propensity is there.
[time=2074] In His character He is extreme, so are we.
[time=2080] We should be excessive, here it is my friends, as well as our excess, and our extremeness shows itself
[time=2089] in ways that reflect His image, not our fallenness.
[time=2094] As long as our excessiveness imitates His character and not our selfishness, as long as our excessiveness mirrors His image and not our sinfulness.
[time=2110] God made you and me to be over the top.
[time=2115] He made us to be lavish.
[time=2119] It's just that our lavishness is to reflect His character.
[time=2124] So I picked three.
[time=2126] Go to Panera, you can pick two.
[time=2128] Come here, you get three.
[time=2129] Three excessive traits of God that I want us to look at
[time=2135] and talk about over the next three weeks, the ninth, today, the 16th, and the 23rd.
[time=2140] I hope you'll be here as we look to the Word of God and understand better the excessive extreme nature of God and our opportunity to model and mirror those very things.
[time=2151] Here you go, first one.
[time=2153] For this morning, sort of a combo package deal, if you will.
[time=2158] And we've sort of already looked at one of them, but I want you to write this down, my friends.
[time=2162] God is excessively merciful and gracious.
[time=2167] Our God, the God that you have the privilege of living in relationship with, if you know and have fully surrendered your heart and life to a son, that God is excessively over the top when it comes to mercy
[time=2181] and grace, excessively merciful, excessively gracious.
[time=2186] We tend to be, in our fallenness, excessively judgmental and excessively critical and harsh.
[time=2194] This is our human bent, yet we were made in the image
[time=2200] of God.
[time=2203] All right, here's your chance to talk.
[time=2205] Again, for some of you in the room, this might be just good review.
[time=2208] For others of you, you may be learning something new here, which I'm really thankful for whenever that happens, mercy and grace.
[time=2214] What do they mean?
[time=2216] What's just a decent little definition of mercy?
[time=2219] Think about it.
[time=2220] And what's a little definition of grace?
[time=2222] And maybe just talk for a second among those two things.
[time=2225] And then thirdly, what's the difference?
[time=2227] Just with somebody around you, behind you in front of you, with your family friend or with a stranger, go.
[time=2233] Talk about the difference between mercy and grace.
[time=2236] Maybe a little definition of both.
[time=2238] Go for it.
[time=2238] Remember, speak up.
[time=2239] For those of you that are watching the broadcast,
[time=2249] you can do the same thing at home.
[time=2253] You can talk with somebody that you may be watching this with.
[time=2256] You may just grab a little piece of paper and write it down.
[time=2261] But whether you're here in the room or you're watching at home or you're listening online, just take a minute and talk about the difference between mercy and grace.
[time=2271] Good job.
[time=2272] There you go, nice and loud.
[time=2278] Love to hear you talking.
[time=2279] All right, 30 seconds.
[time=2286] Come on, keep going.
[time=2287] Difference between mercy and grace.
[time=2292] All right, good job.
[time=2300] Well done.
[time=2309] Thank you.
[time=2311] I even had to kind of repeat myself there a few times to get you to be quiet.
[time=2314] I like that.
[time=2316] OK, again, kind of basic, but I think really important for us to understand as we think about the nature and the character of God, he is excessively merciful.
[time=2327] Mercy-- you can see it on the screen here-- mercy and grace.
[time=2332] Mercy is not getting what we deserve.
[time=2337] When we do what's wrong, when we say what's wrong, when we think what's wrong, any time, there's a transgression.
[time=2348] Any time sin is falling short of God's standard.
[time=2353] Any time you and I fall short, any time anybody fall short, in any sense, something wrong has happened.
[time=2360] There is a perpetrator.
[time=2362] There is one who is guilty.
[time=2364] But mercy is when that person doesn't get what they absolutely deserve to get.
[time=2372] It's mercy.
[time=2374] God is excessive in the offering all the time with all of us.
[time=2383] God is excessively mercy.
[time=2386] He backs up the mercy truck, and he dumps that thing on you, and it just keeps coming.
[time=2393] And you and I both know that there are times without question where we don't get what we do deserve, right?
[time=2404] Mercy-- grace.
[time=2405] I heard some of you talking about grace.
[time=2407] Grace is the kind of the flip side.
[time=2409] Getting-- it's when we do get what we don't deserve.
[time=2414] What you and I deserve-- remember this.
[time=2418] And I want you to remember this not just with respect to an incident.
[time=2424] Yes, with respect to sinful incidents, you and I deserve judgment.
[time=2429] But wait a minute.
[time=2430] Back up a bit.
[time=2432] Don't forget-- and we do sometimes-- that just because you're human, forget the incidents, just in our humanness and our fallenness, we deserve judgment.
[time=2448] Because we are not like him.
[time=2451] He is holy.
[time=2452] He is perfect.
[time=2453] He is pure.
[time=2454] And his character just pristine just as white and clear and bright.
[time=2460] And you and I, whether it's a little dot of ink, or whether it's a truckload of transgression and iniquity,
[time=2469] in our humanness, in our fallenness, we deserve judgment.
[time=2473] But what we get-- but what you and I get so many times
[time=2479] is favor and blessing and gifts and kindness, amen?
[time=2487] It's amazing what you and I get.
[time=2489] Getting what we do not deserve grace.
[time=2494] Not getting what we do deserve mercy.
[time=2497] Here's a verse I want to show you from the Scriptures how some of this plays out.
[time=2503] Here's a verse where actually both are implied.
[time=2507] Both are just said directly and powerfully.
[time=2510] Go to Psalm 86, if you would.
[time=2515] Turn your Bibles to Psalm.
[time=2517] We're going to turn back and forth here quite a few places.
[time=2520] Journey with me as we do that.
[time=2522] 86, 14.
[time=2524] It says in Psalm 86, verse 14 and 15 here, David cries out, oh, God, arrogant men have risen up against me.
[time=2533] Are you there?
[time=2534] Psalm 86, 14.
[time=2536] Oh, God, arrogant men have risen up against me and a band of violent men have sought my life.
[time=2542] And they, these arrogant, violent men who are seeking to do something wrong, they have not set you before them, God.
[time=2552] And what's God's response?
[time=2554] What is God's character?
[time=2555] What is God's nature?
[time=2558] As David describes these kinds of men, as David describes this kind of activity, but you, oh, Lord, or a God, merciful.
[time=2567] And what?
[time=2568] Gracious.
[time=2570] Slow to anger, mercy.
[time=2575] An abundant and loving kindness, grace.
[time=2580] Slow to anger and abundant and loving kindness and truth.
[time=2585] Go to Romans.
[time=2588] Go back to your New Testament.
[time=2589] Go to Romans right before you get to first and second Corinthians.
[time=2592] You'll come to Romans.
[time=2593] Go to Romans 5.
[time=2595] I love how Paul describes this as he writes to the church at Rome.
[time=2600] Thank you for turning there.
[time=2602] Look with me in the fifth chapter of Romans in verse 19.
[time=2607] It says, "For as through," we've taught you this, and days gone by, many of you will remember this, "for as through the one man's disobedience," Adam, Genesis 3.
[time=2621] "The many," you and I, "were made sinners.
[time=2625] Even so in that same way," the text says, "the obedience of the one, capital O Christ.
[time=2634] Even so, through the obedience of Christ, the many," you and me, "will be made righteous."
[time=2642] The law, Paul goes on, the law came in so that the transgression would increase.
[time=2650] Stop right there.
[time=2651] This speaks to the purpose of the Mosaic law, the Old Testament law.
[time=2655] Many of you know it was never a law that was established there, so man could somehow do everything that was in it and be righteous.
[time=2663] No, there was so much of it.
[time=2667] The law was always intended to show man's frailty and our sinfulness because there was no way they could keep all the law, which set them up for Messiah in a perfect way, but they missed it.
[time=2682] But you see there in Romans 5, 20, I don't want you to miss this, the law came in so that the transgression would, what, increase, but where sin increased, grace, what?
[time=2698] Say it louder, a bounded, excessive language there, my friends, where sin increased, where transgressions multiplied, the nature of God is such that grace simply got deeper and broader.
[time=2715] There was just more and more of it.
[time=2717] I grew up in California.
[time=2723] Most of you know that.
[time=2724] I grew up as a young little guy.
[time=2726] My mom taken me to the beach almost weekly.
[time=2729] One of the things I first remember about the beach was literally the little shovel and the little bucket my mom would give me.
[time=2738] And I just, like most kids, was drawn to the water.
[time=2740] And I'd go down by the water and I'd plop down.
[time=2742] And like most kids, I just started what?
[time=2746] You just start digging.
[time=2747] There's just something about being a kid.
[time=2748] You want to dig.
[time=2749] And I just remember, as a little guy, realizing what all of us now know to be true, whether you're in California or in Indiana, when you dig deep enough, you hit what?
[time=2760] Water.
[time=2761] And it used to bug me.
[time=2763] 'Cause I just wanted to dig a hole.
[time=2766] I wanted to get in the hole.
[time=2767] I mean, I wanted to dig this hole.
[time=2768] And every time I dig this hole, the further and further I dug.
[time=2771] Listen, the further and further I dug, the bigger hole I dug for myself.
[time=2778] You with me?
[time=2779] The bigger the hole I dug for myself, the more water came.
[time=2786] You should never presume upon his grace.
[time=2794] You should never take advantage of his grace.
[time=2799] But that's the truth.
[time=2801] Scandalous.
[time=2805] That's the truth.
[time=2808] His grace abounds all the more.
[time=2813] It's over the top.
[time=2816] Psalm 119, we read this last couple of weeks
[time=2822] as we talked about the restorative nature of God and his reviving power.
[time=2828] I'll just read it to you again quickly.
[time=2830] It says, in Psalm 119, it says, "Great are your mercy.
[time=2833] Great are your mercies, O Lord.
[time=2836] Revive me according to your ordinances." That word "great" there in the Hebrew means abundant, my friends.
[time=2845] It means many abundant and many are your mercies.
[time=2850] You go back to the gospels in the book of Luke, would you turn there?
[time=2854] Luke 6, it says in Luke 6, 35, just a great practical picture painted by our Lord himself.
[time=2863] As he speaks to the attitude and the mindset that you and I should have toward others.
[time=2867] As he speaks to the attitude and mindset that God has toward us, the attitude and mindset that our Lord exemplified on behalf of the Father.
[time=2877] Luke 6, 35, it says, "But love your enemies, and do good, and lend." Jesus says, "Lend people who have need, lend them, give them your resources, whatever that resource might be, and lend expecting in your lending nothing in return."
[time=2898] And you who do that, your reward will be great, and you will be as you lend, as you love your enemies, do good and lend expecting nothing in return.
[time=2907] You will show yourself to be sons of the most high.
[time=2911] How is this?
[time=2912] For he himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men.
[time=2917] Be merciful just as your father is merciful.
[time=2925] I just want you to see there in that text that when God encounters ungratefulness, he's kind.
[time=2931] That is God's response to ungrateful spirits.
[time=2936] That's God's response to those who do not respond to him in the way that they should, the way that we would expect.
[time=2943] When you don't get paid back, when he or she or they don't respond to you
[time=2954] and give to you what they surely should, no one's making an issue of that.
[time=2959] When you don't get paid back, the Scripture reminds us this morning, be merciful, because that's how God treated you.
[time=2971] Merciful, truckload, backed up, poured out, overflowing.
[time=2978] Isaiah 63, I know we're just kind of going back and forth here.
[time=2985] There's so much in God's word that I want you to see, so many examples of these things that I want you to take in.
[time=2993] Go to Isaiah, Isaiah 63, it says there in verses eight and nine for he said, here God, God being referred to and God's love for his people, Israel, surely they are my people, sons who will not deal falsely, so he became their Savior.
[time=3013] In all their affliction, he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them in his love and in his mercy, he redeemed them and he lifted them and carried them all the days of old because of God's excessive love, because of God's excessive mercy, he redeemed them, he lifted them and carried them all the days of old.
[time=3041] And then it says in Psalm 103, Psalm 103 eight, familiar passage, I know to Psalm, it says the Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, mercy and abounding and loving kindness, grace.
[time=3061] He will not always, though, strive with us, nor will he keep back his anger forever, he has not dealt with us according to our sins.
[time=3071] Has he, church?
[time=3073] No, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
[time=3078] For as high, what has he done instead?
[time=3080] For as high as the heavens are above the earth, it's really high.
[time=3085] So great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him.
[time=3090] As far as the east is from the west and that is so very, very far, so far, has he removed our transgressions from us?
[time=3102] Just as a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.
[time=3110] My friends, the scriptures are abundantly clear that our God's character and our God's nature, his image in its purest, most clear form is one of excess when it comes to mercy and grace.
[time=3127] So I've got a question, two questions for you this morning and these would be two questions that you should write down.
[time=3134] These will be two questions that I hope you will think about today as this day moves forward.
[time=3140] I hope as today turns into tomorrow, that you'll think about these questions.
[time=3145] I hope as tomorrow turns into the rest of the week and no matter how old you are, no matter what stage of life you're in, I think these are two questions that in light of what we've seen of our God today, you and I would need to consider and you and I would need to be willing to answer.
[time=3162] These questions surely will show up in our digging deeper curriculum, this study and devotional resource that's made available to you every Wednesday, it's online, it's a continuation of our study and our message from Sunday.
[time=3181] More and more and more of you are accessing the digging deeper material and benefiting from it.
[time=3186] I hope and pray more and more of you will.
[time=3190] But here you go, here's just two questions I hope you'll write down and if you don't write this down and if you don't take this the next step then all this has been for not because the word of God has got to be something that leads us to do.
[time=3201] It's got to be something that moves us to respond.
[time=3204] These great truths have got to be applied.
[time=3207] So here you go, number one.
[time=3209] In what situation or relationship in your life, real-life stuff here?
[time=3214] In what situation or relationship are you delivering judgment?
[time=3219] When you really could hold back, you could not give them what they deserve.
[time=3228] A situation in your life or relationship where excessive mercy really is doable.
[time=3238] You really could take the offense with God's help and treat it like that as far as the East is from the West thing.
[time=3245] You could just hold back what someone may deserve and in doing that, you get the privilege of passing along like priests do.
[time=3258] We've talked about it for years.
[time=3260] New Testament priesthood of believers, that's us and priests pass along to others the nature and character of God.
[time=3267] So in what situation or relationship where you are currently delivering judgment, could you hold that back and exercise the excessive mercy of God?
[time=3278] Second question, in what situation or relationship
[time=3285] are you withholding the blessing or kindness?
[time=3289] You really do because of him, not because of you, because of him, because of Christ in you, because of the redemptive transformation God has worked in your heart and life because the spirit of God lives within you, you really do have the capacity to offer blessing and kindness and you're not.
[time=3311] With whom are you choosing to be ungracious or graceless?
[time=3317] Your truck's not as big as God's, but you do have a truck and you do get to back it up now and then dump it out over people in your life and there's grace there for you and I to offer and deliver.
[time=3332] In what situation or relationship are you withholding?
[time=3339] The blessing or kindness that because of God's work in you, you really do have the capacity to offer.
[time=3346] Hey, anybody in the room, any of you struggling
[time=3352] with gracelessness, any of you struggling with that second question, I wanna just take it a step further, would you be willing this week?
[time=3360] Would you be willing this morning right now to ask God to forgive you?
[time=3364] You do understand that that would be needed, right?
[time=3370] For those of you in the room, myself included, who might answer that, I got a little list going there of people I'm acting that way with you and I need to confess that.
[time=3383] Would you be willing, first of all, to confess that to him?
[time=3386] Secondly, listen, would you be willing this week to go and ask them to forgive you?
[time=3392] I mean it, whoever it is, whatever it might entail,
[time=3398] whatever note you might have to write, whatever lunch you might have to set up, whatever coffee you may need to go and grab, would you be willing to go to someone and say, hey, I'm to reflect the grace of my God and with you I have failed miserably, would you forgive me?
[time=3416] They may respond poorly, they may respond wonderfully,
[time=3422] they may say, never knew you were doing that, but thanks for telling me, either way, it means a lot to you, we know it means a lot to him.
[time=3437] Would you ask them to forgive you?
[time=3438] Here's another question for you on that withholding grace,
[time=3444] front, would you be willing this week to intentionally find a way to go out of your way?
[time=3451] Remember God did with you.
[time=3453] Would you be willing to go out of your way to bless them this week?
[time=3459] Asking forgiveness is one thing, writing a note is a good thing.
[time=3462] Would you go out of your way this week to bring to their life somehow, some way, a blessing, an act of kindness and generosity?
[time=3470] What a privilege it's been the last couple of weeks to read the scriptures over you as a family, what a joy last week to get to pray for many of you down here in the front.
[time=3481] (upbeat music)
