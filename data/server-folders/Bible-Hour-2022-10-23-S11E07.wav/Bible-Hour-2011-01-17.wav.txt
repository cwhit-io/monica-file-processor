[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] [MUSIC - 184 seconds]
[time=217] [AMEN] Let's clap for God this morning.
[time=225] (audience applauds) - Thanks for singing that with us.
[time=233] It's true that God, in some regard, responds to us when we gather together and He responds to us in a way that's unique and different than when I'm at home alone by the fireplace with my Bible open.
[time=248] And I'm praying and I'm hoping what we prayed and saying hopefully in that song, that God would come and that He would teach us something today that He would move among us, that He would help us to grow collectively as much as we grow together individually.
[time=264] So that's my prayer this morning.
[time=266] You may be seated.
[time=267] And one of the things that we have planned today that I believe God used first hour and I'm hoping that He uses again second hour is a guest group coming in here shortly.
[time=279] Yeah, Mike Cunningham and the choir from Chain of Lakes Correctional Facility are here.
[time=285] Yeah, you can welcome them as they come.
[time=288] (audience applauds) I'm thankful that God kind of crossed our paths together
[time=301] in the last few weeks and Mike's gonna explain a little bit about what the guys have been doing and who they are and then they're gonna sing for us today.
[time=308] And I know that you'll be blessed.
[time=310] So, Mike.
[time=310] - Thank you very much, Corbin.
[time=311] You're welcome.
[time=312] - Good morning.
[time=313] (audience laughs) Wow.
[time=316] My name is Mike Cunningham and I'm honored and blessed to be Superintendent of the Chain of Lakes Correctional Facility.
[time=324] This is a wonderful morning that the Lord has made.
[time=329] Those of you that know me, I can be a little hard-headed.
[time=333] This is nothing that came at me, but it came through me from God.
[time=339] This vision of our facility that's located about 38 miles north of here, to have a men's gospel choir.
[time=348] Now, some people may say a choir in prison.
[time=351] Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know about your God, but our God works in mysterious ways.
[time=357] (audience applauds)
[time=365] We all fall short of the glory of God, myself included, but we have to work at it daily.
[time=371] God gave me this vision several months ago, but being hard-headed as I am, it took me several months to get to it.
[time=382] The men that you're gonna be hearing from shortly have only been together for less than three months.
[time=392] It's not me, it's God that's in them.
[time=395] They're moving in the right direction.
[time=399] Enjoy, God bless you all, and get ready to hear wonderful hymns.
[time=404] (audience applauds) [AMEN] Amen, this song says, "Oh, come let us magnify the Lord,
[time=416] "'cause He is worthy to be praised." How many of you know that the Lord is worthy to be praised this morning?
[time=421] [AMEN] (audience applauds) Oh, come one, two, a one, two.
[time=426] [MUSIC - 173 seconds]
[time=601] [AMEN] (audience applauding)
[time=605] [MUSIC]
[time=609] This next song is, I know everybody knows this.
[time=611] It says, "Our God is an awesome God." How many of you know that the Lord is awesome today?
[time=616] He reigns in heaven above.
[time=618] And I thank God that even though he's all powerful, that he can send his Holy Spirit into my heart just to be personal with me.
[time=625] Amen?
[time=626] I thank God that I need that sometimes.
[time=628] So just need to fill the Lord sometimes.
[time=631] Amen?
[time=632] Thank you, Jesus.
[time=633] [MUSIC - 202 seconds]
[time=840] (audience applauds)
[time=850] Hey man, this next song, it just says bow down and worship him.
[time=865] I know a lot of us, we get so busy in our day-to-day life
[time=871] that we forget about God and he's the one that, he's the reason that we're here, amen?
[time=877] So we just have to make sure that we take some time out and worship him.
[time=880] There's a song that says, when the praises go up, guess what, the blessings come down.
[time=885] So we need to remember that.
[time=886] We need to really know what true worship is and lifting up my Savior, Jesus Christ, amen?
[time=893] So this song says bow down and worship him.
[time=897] And I hope, maybe you can sing it with us when you figure out what's going on.
[time=900] [MUSIC - 278 seconds]
[time=1183] Amen. (audience applauding)
[time=1198] [AMEN]
[time=1215] (audience applauding) [AMEN] (audience applauding) - Well, hello again, welcome everybody to the Bible Hour.
[time=1230] It's great to be with you again.
[time=1231] I'm thankful for this time together and thankful for a new year.
[time=1235] Here we are in the middle of January.
[time=1238] And here we are in the middle of a new series on Sunday mornings here at Black Hawk.
[time=1242] I hope you've been watching.
[time=1243] Last week we began what we've entitled "Excessive." It is a series that describes the nature of our God.
[time=1252] God, as you heard last week, is over the top.
[time=1255] He is by nature excessive.
[time=1257] He is by his very character extreme.
[time=1261] And what we established last week was that we are too.
[time=1264] We tend to be extreme.
[time=1266] We tend to be excessive.
[time=1268] Problem is because of sin and our fallenness, our excessiveness takes us in all the wrong directions.
[time=1275] We need to in our relationship with Jesus Christ be pointed toward excess.
[time=1281] We need to be pointed toward extreme living not sinfully but in ways that would honor God.
[time=1288] In ways that would be like Him.
[time=1290] And He is most certainly excessive.
[time=1293] Excessive and mercy and grace we saw last week.
[time=1296] And what we're gonna talk about today, you'll see, is that God is excessive.
[time=1299] He's over the top and lavish in His pursuit of us.
[time=1304] And maybe you've felt this.
[time=1306] Maybe you've experienced this.
[time=1308] God pursuing you, God coming after you.
[time=1311] God stopping at nothing to get your attention.
[time=1315] And whether you're far from God and thinking about Christianity and trying to make sense of what it means to live in relationship with Him.
[time=1324] Or whether you're in relationship with Him, a fully surrendered follower of Christ, you and I both know what it's like to continue to feel and sense the faithful, ongoing, relentless pursuit of God.
[time=1337] I'm thankful for it and I hope you are too.
[time=1339] I hope as you watch today, that not only will you pay attention to the ways in which He pursues you, but I hope that maybe as you watch this, there may be others in your life.
[time=1349] And I mean this.
[time=1350] There may be others in your life who come to mind.
[time=1353] There may be people who don't know Him, who are far from Him, who you want desperately to see Him bring them to faith.
[time=1360] And I hope as you watch today that you'll pray for them and His involvement with them, I think you'll know people in your life like I do who know the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1370] But today aren't walking with Him.
[time=1373] Their lives are more characterized by disobedience than obedience and we'll see today that His commitment to them is to pursue them, to get their attention and to stop at nothing to do so.
[time=1384] I pray that you'll keep them in your mind and pray for them as well.
[time=1388] It's good for us to be together.
[time=1390] I'm thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=1391] I hope today's message will be an encouragement and an inspiration to you.
[time=1395] God bless you.
[time=1396] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=1400] Well, hey, if you were here last week, you know that we started a new series, a three week series that we've entitled, "Excessive." You can see the picture there and the word on the screen.
[time=1410] It is a word that we have chosen to talk about the nature of God.
[time=1417] Three week series really on the character of our God.
[time=1420] We have seen and we established last week that our God is excessive.
[time=1425] The word means over the top.
[time=1427] The word means lavish.
[time=1429] The word means extreme.
[time=1431] Was looking at a book about a month and a half ago called "Prodigal God." And I always thought the word prodigal, as it related to the prodigal son, I always thought the word prodigal meant wayward or rebellious or sinful.
[time=1445] Turns out the word means excessive.
[time=1448] It's the way the prodigal son lived.
[time=1451] It's the way he spent the inheritance that his father had given him.
[time=1454] He was prodigal.
[time=1455] He was excessive in our God, though not excessive in the way the prodigal son was, is surely over the top and extremely lavish in his character.
[time=1467] We saw last week how he is excessively merciful.
[time=1471] Saw last week how he is excessively over the top above and beyond with his grace.
[time=1478] And this morning we come to a second week in the series and a second characteristic of our God.
[time=1484] And that is the fact that our God is relentless in his pursuit of us, our relentless God, excessive in his pursuit of those he loves.
[time=1497] All right, now, hang on.
[time=1499] When I started thinking this week, about one, when I started thinking about somebody who is relentless in their pursuit of somebody else, I'm sorry, my mind went to the movies.
[time=1514] And so I'm thinking about movies and my mind goes back to the late 80s early.
[time=1518] I know some of you kids think you know about action thrillers.
[time=1523] I know some of you kids think that transformers is like the bomb or however you say that.
[time=1528] I know you get all excited about Iron Man, all right?
[time=1533] I want you to know, you haven't seen an action hero until you've seen this guy right here, okay?
[time=1540] That, my friends, is an action hero.
[time=1543] That is called, oh, his name's Arnold Schwarzenegger, but he played the what, the Terminator, okay.
[time=1548] But in the Terminator, especially Terminator 2, there was this guy.
[time=1552] Do you remember this guy?
[time=1555] Does anybody raise your hand if you remember this guy?
[time=1558] A lot of old people, I like that.
[time=1560] This guy looked like a cop, but he's this droid robot dude who had one mission relentlessly pursue Arnold and destroy him.
[time=1572] And so it didn't matter what they did to this guy.
[time=1574] Do you remember?
[time=1575] They'd shoot him with shotguns and there'd be these big holes in him and they'd just kind of cover up and he'd just keep going.
[time=1581] They'd drop him from helicopters.
[time=1583] They'd run over him with 18 wheelers.
[time=1585] It didn't matter what they did to him.
[time=1587] He would not be deterred.
[time=1590] He was gonna go after this guy and it didn't matter what happened.
[time=1593] He was focused and he was relentless and he was excessive.
[time=1598] All right, we'll lighten it up a little bit.
[time=1601] You know, you know what the number one all-time greatest action-adventure romance, see, I just fooled you.
[time=1611] He thought I was going real bang, bang, shoot away.
[time=1614] You know what the all-time greatest action-adventure romance movie of all-time is, don't you?
[time=1619] Right, here we go.
[time=1623] Boom.
[time=1624] Who in the room has seen the princess bride?
[time=1627] Raise your hand.
[time=1629] Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[time=1631] Wait, I'm sorry.
[time=1632] Raise your hand if you haven't.
[time=1634] Oh my goodness.
[time=1639] Oh, chick flick.
[time=1640] Would you relax?
[time=1641] Is not a chick flick.
[time=1642] Wait, there were over like 200 people.
[time=1645] Do we have the DVD?
[time=1646] Let's just watch it right now.
[time=1648] I can't believe this.
[time=1651] If you haven't seen the princess bride, go buy it at Walgreens for $6.99.
[time=1656] Just buy it and take it home.
[time=1657] Your kids will love it.
[time=1659] For those of you that have seen the princess bride, the number one action thriller romance of all-time, you know about Wesley and his pursuit of princess who?
[time=1667] Buttercup.
[time=1668] Gosh, I love to hear that.
[time=1669] You know that as he finds himself separated from her, the love of his life, his true love, he goes through great ordeal and trial to find her.
[time=1678] Here, if you haven't seen the movie, I'll just tell it to you right now.
[time=1681] He has the sword fight.
[time=1682] Remember the sword fight with Enigo.
[time=1684] Enigo who?
[time=1685] Enigo Montoya.
[time=1687] My name is Enigo Montoya.
[time=1689] You killed my father, prepared to die.
[time=1692] See, I tried out for the part, but they said I was too tall to be a Spaniard.
[time=1698] He has this incredible sword fight with Enigo Montoya, the man who was trying to avenge his father's death by the six-pinkered man, but I say too much.
[time=1706] I'll keep going.
[time=1707] He wrestles, he wrestles Phezic.
[time=1710] Andre, the giant, played Phezic, and Wesley wrestles Phezic in his efforts, his excessive pursuit to try and find Buttercup.
[time=1718] He outwits Vasini, remember that scene with Vasini there?
[time=1722] He outwits Vasini with the poison, and oh, it's amazing, he survives the fire swamp.
[time=1729] He endures the torture of humperdink all to rescue princess Buttercup.
[time=1736] Give him a hand, there's Wesley.
[time=1737] I kept thinking about the movies,
[time=1743] and that's fun to think about those fun things.
[time=1745] It couldn't help but think about Tom Hanks and Matt Damon.
[time=1748] It couldn't help but think about that World War II epic Saving Private Ryan, where one man was given the mission of finding another, and how he faithfully, stopping at nothing, enduring unbelievable sacrifice and hardship made his way to this young man in an effort to fulfill the mission he had been given.
[time=1768] All of those examples very impressive, and yet nothing, absolutely nothing can compare to the excessive and relentless pursuit
[time=1784] of our God toward those he loves.
[time=1788] Our God, my friends, is excessive and relentless in this pursuit, and I want to show you this morning, basically the two ways in which he accomplishes this.
[time=1798] He is excessively pursuant in the way that he brings people to salvation, and he is excessively pursuant in the way that he brings people toward sanctification.
[time=1809] There's an evangelistic, if you will, side of his pursuit.
[time=1812] He will stop at nothing to bring those that he loves and those that he has called.
[time=1818] He will stop at nothing to bring you to salvation, and having brought you to salvation, he will stop at nothing.
[time=1826] He will act relentlessly in his pursuit of you to grow you, to mature you, to have you be all that he intended you to be.
[time=1838] Excessive in his pursuit of us toward salvation, excessive in his pursuit of us towards sanctification.
[time=1844] This is what we'll consider this morning, and I want to start with his excessive pursuit of those who are, I love this phrase, missing.
[time=1854] Those who are missing, those who haven't made it home yet.
[time=1859] And for that look at the heart of God towards those who are missing, turn with me if you would please in your Bibles to the Gospel of Luke.
[time=1867] The New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, would you turn to Luke chapter 15?
[time=1876] And as we look at several verses in the hole of chapter 15, I want you to see for yourself the very heart and nature and character of God as it relates to those who are far from him.
[time=1890] It says in Luke 15, verse one.
[time=1894] I hope you're there and if you don't have a Bible, please read along with someone next to you or you can follow along on the screen.
[time=1900] It says, now all the tax collectors and the sinners, we're coming near him, who's him?
[time=1909] Say it out loud, Jesus.
[time=1912] Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming near Jesus to what?
[time=1917] To listen to him.
[time=1920] Both the Pharisees and the scribes began to grumble saying, this man, look at him.
[time=1926] This man receives sinners and eats with them.
[time=1931] So we told them this parable saying, I want to stop right there.
[time=1937] I want to just give you a little bit of insight.
[time=1939] This is connected to our conversation this morning but a little side note, if you will, to start things off.
[time=1946] All right?
[time=1947] When it says tax collectors and sinners were drawing near, were coming near him.
[time=1957] To listen to him, I want you to understand what this means.
[time=1960] Tax collectors and sinners, this phrase, this phrase would have referred to the most vile of individuals in society at that time.
[time=1971] These were the most vile.
[time=1978] These were those deeply engulfed by their sin and granted it may have been overt sin and it may have given off a clear ugly look.
[time=1987] It may have been more private.
[time=1990] These were the people who were conflicted.
[time=1995] These were the people who were down and out.
[time=1997] These were the people who didn't have it all together.
[time=2003] And it says that they were coming near him to listen to him.
[time=2011] And we've been and we'll keep doing this in the days to come.
[time=2015] We've been trying to teach you and we've been trying to encourage you and we've been trying to set a standard around here that's biblical and true.
[time=2025] We've been trying to help all of you understand that you were never meant to be religious, that you were never meant to be church goers.
[time=2033] We weren't called to be evangelicals.
[time=2037] We've been called by God in His word to be followers of who?
[time=2043] Jesus Christ.
[time=2045] That's what I am.
[time=2048] That's what many of you are.
[time=2050] We are trying our best with His help to follow the ways of Jesus, to be like Him.
[time=2059] So I want to just real quick, I want to just ask you.
[time=2061] I'm not spanking you on the wrist here.
[time=2062] I'm not just saying, I'm not trying to be heavy handed.
[time=2065] This isn't a guilt trip.
[time=2066] I'm just asking you, are the vile, are the addicted, are the sinners, are the tax collectors, are the conflicted in your world drawing near to you?
[time=2079] To listen to you.
[time=2087] Is there something about you?
[time=2090] Like there was something about Him.
[time=2093] It wasn't like they were just okay, we could coexist.
[time=2098] No, they came to Him.
[time=2102] They wanted to be near Him.
[time=2105] And they wanted not only to be near Him, they wanted to hear what He had to say.
[time=2109] Are they coming near to you?
[time=2116] This tells us a lot about Jesus.
[time=2119] This tells us that Jesus was excessively disarming.
[time=2123] Are you?
[time=2124] It tells us that Jesus was excessively gentle in the way that He conducted Himself with those far from His Father.
[time=2132] It shows us that Jesus was excessively compassionate.
[time=2136] You know what He did?
[time=2139] In an excessive and lavish way He put sinners at ease.
[time=2147] Oh my goodness, He told Him the truth, didn't He?
[time=2149] He never held back, but He put Him at ease.
[time=2153] He's disarming and gentle and compassionate.
[time=2156] Just something for Him.
[time=2157] Something for you and I to think about this morning.
[time=2161] Okay, back to His pursuit.
[time=2165] Here in Luke 15, He's in essence saying to the critics, all right, so you're wondering about my love for the lost.
[time=2173] You're bothered by my commitment to those who are missing.
[time=2177] Let me tell you about it.
[time=2179] He says, let me paint a picture for you of how deep that runs in me and how far I'll go.
[time=2185] Look with me at Luke 15, verses three to five.
[time=2188] So He told them this parable, saying what man among you if he has a hundred sheep and has lost how many?
[time=2195] One of them does not leave the 99 in the open pasture and there's the key phrase, go after the one which is lost.
[time=2205] Go after the one which is lost until he what?
[time=2208] Say it, finds it, until he finds it.
[time=2211] When he has found that he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
[time=2217] So if you're spiritually missing this morning,
[time=2224] if you know somebody who's spiritually far from God, what we learn here in the text is that if you're spiritually missing, he goes after you and he pursues you until he finds you.
[time=2237] This whole chapter, Luke 15, shows the heart of God towards those who don't know him yet and the real theme of the chapter is that something of value, something of great value is missing and that's something that is missing warrants and all out search.
[time=2257] What would have been clearly understood in the context of that day where shepherds and sheep were a common everyday occurrence was that this going after a lost sheep would have entailed, and I hope you'll write this down, facing great danger.
[time=2272] For a shepherd to go after a sheep in that day would have more than likely entailed facing great danger.
[time=2281] Church, it would have entailed forging through great adversity.
[time=2287] Here you go, write this down.
[time=2288] For a shepherd to go after a sheep in that day would have potentially required great sacrifice.
[time=2295] Reminds you of anybody?
[time=2298] See this chapter shows us the heart of God towards those who are lost.
[time=2304] This chapter shows us that something of great value is missing and what is missing warrants and all out search.
[time=2314] There were, in those times, in that area, there would be wild animals that would stalk both sheep and shepherd putting the shepherd's life as well at risk.
[time=2327] There was dangerous terrain if a sheep was lost and the shepherd began his journey to find that sheep.
[time=2333] There was dangerous terrain that a shepherd would have to navigate and work his way through in order to reach and rescue that which was lost.
[time=2342] There would be slippery and steep hillsides.
[time=2344] There would be canyons, ravines, holes.
[time=2347] It was quite an undertaking for a shepherd to go after a lost sheep.
[time=2351] A lot could happen.
[time=2352] And I don't want you to miss the significance of verse four.
[time=2356] You see it there?
[time=2357] I just want you to circle it.
[time=2358] I want you to underline it.
[time=2360] I want you to see the heart of God, his excessive nature toward pursuing that which is lost.
[time=2366] If there's 99 okay and just one missing, he goes.
[time=2373] It's not this, it's not on a curve.
[time=2374] It's not a percentage.
[time=2377] His heart is that deep.
[time=2378] His heart is that full for you, for you.
[time=2383] That would have entailed great danger, possibly great sacrifice.
[time=2390] Let's keep going Luke 15, verses eight and nine.
[time=2395] He moves from the lost sheep to the lost coin or what woman, if she has 10 silver coins and loses one does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it.
[time=2410] When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors saying, rejoice with me for I have found the coin which I had lost.
[time=2419] In that day one coin, one drachma or denarius
[time=2428] would have been an enormously significant loss.
[time=2432] You see a drachma or a denarius would have equaled a full day's wage and the use of the word woman indicates that she's probably the single wage earner in this home and thus responsible for the feeding care and well-being of her family.
[time=2448] The key phrase here in these two verses, my friends, is you see it right there in the text.
[time=2454] The key phrase is where it says she lights a lamp, sweeps the house and searches carefully until she finds it.
[time=2462] It reminds me of when I go looking for the remote.
[time=2466] Do I hear an amen on that?
[time=2471] I mean, where does it go?
[time=2472] How many times have you found it and thought to yourself, how in the world did it get there?
[time=2478] Somebody had to put it there and this is all a crazy joke on me.
[time=2482] But no, you understand the picture there.
[time=2485] You understand the desperateness.
[time=2487] There's not a corner she won't look in.
[time=2491] Not a couch, she won't move.
[time=2494] She'll shake rugs, she'll move the refrigerator, she'll look under the bed, she'll reach back into the back of the closet.
[time=2501] She'll crawl and lift and sweep and she'll do it morning, noon and what?
[time=2506] Night and we say night because she lit a what?
[time=2509] A lamp.
[time=2510] It didn't matter when it was.
[time=2513] She was gonna find the coin.
[time=2516] This short but powerful story that Jesus tells indicates that the search for that which was lost would have entailed, and I hope you'll write this down too, would have entailed giving great effort.
[time=2528] Giving great effort.
[time=2532] The pursuit, the excessive and extreme pursuit of that which is lost will entail at times great danger.
[time=2539] It will require giving great effort and again we see the heart of God in this.
[time=2545] And then he moves on in Luke 15, verse 11 is where it begins
[time=2551] and this is in fact the story of the prodigal son.
[time=2554] We won't read the entire story.
[time=2556] Most of you in the room are somewhat familiar with it.
[time=2558] It's the story of a son basically who wanted his money.
[time=2562] He wanted his inheritance from his father.
[time=2564] He had an older brother.
[time=2565] Older brother stayed home and did what he was supposed to do.
[time=2568] Younger brother said, I'm outta here.
[time=2570] Goes to his dad, give me my inheritance.
[time=2572] His dad gives him the inheritance and the boy goes and lives in a prodigal way, excessively squandering all that the father had given him.
[time=2580] He lives loose, he lives loud, he's out on the edge, living it up, he ends up broke, all the money gone.
[time=2589] He ends up feeding pigs for a job in a pig's die,
[time=2595] eating the food that the pigs eat.
[time=2598] And it's at that moment that he drops to his knees realizing what has happened.
[time=2602] He realizes he needs to go home and seek forgiveness from his father.
[time=2607] He hopes that maybe just maybe the father will forgive him enough to just maybe hire him, to be a hired hand, to work for him.
[time=2616] So it's time to go home and I want you to look with me at verse 20.
[time=2621] Just this one verse says so much about the heart of God towards those who are lost, those who are missing.
[time=2630] So he got up, the son did, from the pig's die, if you will.
[time=2634] And he made his way home, he came to his father.
[time=2638] But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt what, say it, compassion for him and what, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.
[time=2655] The parable of the excessive, prodigal son is unique on many fronts when compared to other parables.
[time=2663] One difference is that it has more than one lesson really, more than just one story.
[time=2669] There are several stories within this one parable.
[time=2673] There is the elder brother.
[time=2675] The elder brother illustrates really for us as you read the story on and you get to the part where the elder brother responds to the sinning younger brother coming home.
[time=2688] You see in the text that the elder brother illustrates the wickedness of the Pharisees.
[time=2695] They're self-righteous, prejudice and indifferent attitude toward repenting sinners.
[time=2702] Lots to learn about the older brother.
[time=2705] There is the lesson that we learn about the father as the parable of the prodigal son develops, you begin to realize that the father in the story is really God the father.
[time=2715] It's what's being illustrated.
[time=2718] We see in the father God's eagerness and his readiness to forgive and the father's, here it is, the father's longing for the return of the sinning son.
[time=2728] Another main feature of the parable is, and then we see this in the lost coin and we see this in the lost sheep as well.
[time=2738] It's the joy of God.
[time=2740] The joy of God, my friends, and the celebration of God that fills heaven when sinners repent and come home to faith in his son.
[time=2749] I want you to, just for a moment, stop.
[time=2755] I want every one of you to do your very best on this, to just stop and picture this father in verse 20.
[time=2762] And I want you to put yourself in his cloak, if you will, put yourself in his sandals.
[time=2768] In the text there in verse 20 it says, but while he the son, and don't forget this, but while he the son, remember the disobedient, foolish, promiscuous, disrespectful son.
[time=2781] This is the son that this father has been dealing with.
[time=2785] Many of you in the room understand these things.
[time=2790] You've felt those feelings before.
[time=2792] You've encountered those attitudes.
[time=2796] It says in the text, but while he was still a long way off, his father, what, saw him.
[time=2805] This is fascinating.
[time=2807] The picture here that gets painted and what's clearly implied is that there was, on this father's property, a road, a way, a trail, a path, if you will, one that led to the house.
[time=2823] And what's implied is that the father, the dad had his eye on that road.
[time=2828] Can you picture that?
[time=2831] The father who had been mistreated by an ungrateful, immoral, self-indulgent, foolish son was waiting, watching, hoping, scanning the horizon.
[time=2855] I would have been, I hate to say it.
[time=2859] It's probably true more than likely, except for the grace of God and me, I would be busy.
[time=2866] I would have shaken the dust off my feet, I think I would have said, be done with you.
[time=2872] I would have, in my pride and arrogance, and many of you would as well.
[time=2877] We would have been done with him.
[time=2879] And there he is.
[time=2883] Can you picture him?
[time=2884] Waiting, watching, hopeful, scanning the horizon.
[time=2889] I read this week that considering the amount of time it would have taken to burn through the entire inheritance.
[time=2897] This wasn't a wait that took a few weeks.
[time=2900] No, this would have been many, many, many months.
[time=2905] This father's waiting would have been extremely painful.
[time=2910] And what we see entailed here is that while pursuing, although this was a passive pursuit, you get it, he's not pursuing him, but he's passively pursuing him while he waits for him.
[time=2923] This would have meant enduring great heartache.
[time=2925] I hope you'll write that down as well.
[time=2927] Enduring great heartache.
[time=2931] There would be the need to face great danger as we look into the heart of God.
[time=2935] There would be the giving of great effort, and now we come to the enduring of great heartache.
[time=2941] And this is the way in which God pursues.
[time=2944] These are the things that transpire.
[time=2947] You can think about the woman at the well in John 4.
[time=2950] Jesus and the disciples making their way to Jerusalem didn't even have to go to where this well was.
[time=2956] There were three or four shorter routes, but he goes out of his way to meet this one woman whose life and heart and soul so desperately needed answers and hope and forgiveness.
[time=2970] He is excessive in his pursuit of those who need him.
[time=2975] I think about Paul used to be Saul, used to be the murderer, used to be the torture, or used to be the one who imprisoned believers.
[time=2985] And God pursues him on the road to Damascus, lights out.
[time=2990] I mean, lights on, bright light from heaven.
[time=2994] Guys jumping into the ditches and there's Paul just squarely in the crosshairs of God's redeeming grace,
[time=3003] as God calls him to himself and reveals to him the plans that God had for his life.
[time=3009] He stops at nothing in his pursuit of those who he wants to bring home.
[time=3015] Some of you in the room this morning before we move on, some of you here today, some of you watching on the broadcast, some of you listening online.
[time=3027] He's coming after you and he's not coming after you to get you.
[time=3031] He's coming after you to save you, to redeem you, to give you a life and you've been asking questions and you're here again and you keep coming again and again and again and the spirit of God is drawing you to himself.
[time=3046] And our hope is that you would not resist that, but allow us the privilege of introducing you to him and a life that you never ever imagined, the opportunity to walk in relationship with a living God who made you and who wants to spend eternity with you.
[time=3064] And he's excessive in his pursuit of you, relentless, stopping at nothing.
[time=3071] When he gets you, when you come to faith in his son, many of you in the room have fully surrendered your hearts and lives to him.
[time=3079] When you come to faith in him, the pursuit doesn't end.
[time=3082] No, it increases in some ways.
[time=3084] And here we see his excessive pursuit of those who are found.
[time=3089] He, God, stops at nothing to spiritually finish what he started with you at that moment that you came to faith.
[time=3100] Whenever that was, you may have been five, you may have been 25, it may have been two weeks ago, it could have been two years ago, but whenever it was that you fully surrendered, all chips to the middle, all faith in him, all hope, all trust.
[time=3114] God, I'm yours, do with me what you will.
[time=3117] I want to honor and follow you at that moment.
[time=3121] The scripture says he began to do something in you, to grow you, to be like his son.
[time=3128] It's called sanctification.
[time=3130] And he grows you in that.
[time=3132] And what it says in Philippians 1-6, I want you to turn there, if you will.
[time=3135] It says in Philippians 1-6, Paul is talking about this very dynamic, this spiritual truth that we just referred to, this point of salvation where your heart and your soul is redeemed.
[time=3148] It says in Philippians 1-6, "For I am confident of this very thing "that he who began a good work in you "will everybody look at that word." Everybody look at that word.
[time=3160] He's confident that what God began in him, God will what, say it?
[time=3166] Perfect.
[time=3167] And sometimes we read over that quickly.
[time=3171] Don't read over that quickly today.
[time=3173] And I say that because it's an indicator of the kind of pursuit from God you're likely to encounter.
[time=3181] Because God isn't trying to grow you into a C-plus believer.
[time=3186] God's not trying to just sort of get you there.
[time=3190] Make sense?
[time=3191] He's trying to what?
[time=3193] Perfect you.
[time=3195] So imagine what he's gonna bring.
[time=3198] Imagine what he's gonna walk you through.
[time=3200] Imagine the challenges that he'll allow.
[time=3202] Imagine the things he wants to teach you.
[time=3206] 'Cause he's not going from middle of the road.
[time=3207] He wants to perfect you.
[time=3211] It's a high bar.
[time=3213] And he promises to get you there.
[time=3216] You and I need to be willing and ready and able to follow faithfully.
[time=3222] Look at Colossians 1-28.
[time=3226] Go back to Colossians 1-28.
[time=3228] We've read this verse, it really is in some ways kind of the foundation of our ministry here at Blackhawk.
[time=3234] We've said this to you before.
[time=3236] It's exactly what we want to see happen with every one of you that calls this place home.
[time=3242] Paul says we proclaim him, we proclaim Christ.
[time=3246] And we, in our ministry to our people, Paul says we admonish every man, we teach every man with all wisdom so that we may with God's help present every man what?
[time=3256] Say it, complete, complete.
[time=3261] This is the end game that you and I would be completed in our faith.
[time=3268] You're trying to sell your house.
[time=3271] Let's just say, maybe some of you are.
[time=3273] You're trying to sell your house, or maybe you're not trying to sell it.
[time=3276] Maybe it's just, let's just think about your house or mine.
[time=3279] Imagine though, if you're trying to sell it and it's on the market and people are coming to look at it and there's about two or three pretty big projects around the house that are half done.
[time=3291] Anybody have any half done projects at your house?
[time=3296] So the heads just dropped.
[time=3298] Wives, elbows, just started pumping.
[time=3301] You know what I mean?
[time=3304] It's just not good.
[time=3305] You walk by it and you go, oh, I gotta get that done.
[time=3310] There's nothing good about half done and God has never for a moment wanted anything in you, but fully completed.
[time=3321] And he has promised to do that and he is relentless in his pursuit to see that done.
[time=3329] One thing as I think about this, and I've talked to many of you about this, one thing that is so powerful about this part of his pursuit, this part of his character and the way he comes after us.
[time=3343] One of the things that's so powerful is the memories that so many of us in the room this morning have of those who gave up on us.
[time=3350] They tried for a while, but the frustration mounted, the pain was too great, cost was too high.
[time=3358] And in all honesty, we understand to a degree, don't we?
[time=3361] Their exit from our life in some ways because they all had their what?
[time=3366] They all had their limits.
[time=3368] But see, that's the point.
[time=3370] God has none.
[time=3371] He has no limits.
[time=3374] If you are his, encompassed by his love, he is going to grow you, mature you, and complete what he started, he will not leave you.
[time=3385] He will confront your sin.
[time=3387] Listen, he will confront your sin through the word of God, through the people of God at times, through the spirit of God that dwells in you.
[time=3396] He won't let it rest.
[time=3398] He will bring godly people into your life to mentor and guide you.
[time=3402] He will blanket you with conviction at times through the Holy Spirit.
[time=3406] He will sometimes do the still small voice thing, you know?
[time=3411] And sometimes he will blow up your life loud, if he has to.
[time=3417] He'll whisper to you, his desires for you, or use a megaphone in your ear if he has to.
[time=3424] He'll have a pastor preach messages week after week that seem to be personally prepared just for you.
[time=3432] Can't tell you how many times I've heard you say that.
[time=3436] He pursues you.
[time=3438] He will grow you here, or he'll take you away.
[time=3442] He'll grow you this week, or he'll still be in it next month, even next year, he's relentless.
[time=3449] He pursues you through your failure and your victories.
[time=3452] We learned last week where sin increases grace, what, abounds?
[time=3457] And just when you were convinced, just when you were convinced that you had to be out of chances with God, you read in Psalms that his mercies are everlasting.
[time=3471] He mercifully gives you another chance.
[time=3474] He is excessive.
[time=3476] He's patient while you wander.
[time=3481] He's ready with next steps each and every time you respond.
[time=3485] Listen, he will never forsake you.
[time=3490] (upbeat music)
