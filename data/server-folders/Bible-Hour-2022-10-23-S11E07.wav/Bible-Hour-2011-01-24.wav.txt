[time=896] Well hello again everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=899] It's great to be with you again and what a great opportunity for us to again take some time this morning and look at the excessive nature of God.
[time=910] The excessive lavish over-the-top extreme nature of God.
[time=916] A God who in our relationship with him we are to emulate.
[time=920] And if you've been following us for the last few weeks you know that we've looked at the excessive mercy of God, the excessive graciousness of God.
[time=929] Last week we looked at his excessive pursuit of us.
[time=933] He never gives up, he never stops, he's always coming after us.
[time=938] And yet today we come to a quality or a trait or an attribute of God that I think is extremely significant. Today we talk about the excessive generosity
[time=950] of our God. Do you know that? Do you understand that our God is excessively generous?
[time=956] He is over-the-top and lavish in his kindness.
[time=960] And while I certainly appreciate and I certainly feel like there's room in your life and mine
[time=966] for growth on the merciful gracious and pursuing others front.
[time=971] As I thought about it this week I think of all the things we've looked at in this series, this one attribute, the generosity of God, his kindness, might be the one attribute that if
[time=982] if you and I were to emulate it, if we as a church, if we as believers today were
[time=990] really thoroughly willing to emulate this one quality, if we were generous, if we were kind,
[time=999] if we weren't greedy, if we weren't selfish, if we weren't prideful, if we didn't
[time=1006] hoard and hang on to, and if we weren't consumed with getting, but instead we're free to give,
[time=1013] I believe it would make an enormous difference in our lives. I think it would make a tremendous
[time=1019] difference in the kingdom of God moving forward. I think it would put on display the nature of our God in a way for the world in which we live in that would be utterly and absolutely miraculous.
[time=1030] So I hope you'll listen today. I hope you'll consider the kindness and the generosity of God.
[time=1036] It'll blow you away. And then again, as we've said the last few weeks, then it is for you and I to look at this quality of his and then emulate it. Take steps in the next days and the next weeks
[time=1047] to begin to function and think and act more like him. Boy, I hope we could be a more generous people.
[time=1055] I hope kindness can flow out of you and me and the days to come in a way that would make a difference
[time=1061] for all of eternity. Thank you so much for your partnership and your friendship. Thanks for being
[time=1067] a part of this family. I'm so thankful that we've gotten to look at the excessiveness of God. I hope
[time=1073] you've been encouraged and I hope you'll come and see you soon. We'd love to meet you. We'd love to get to know you. We'd love to provide a home for you and a family that you could be a part of.
[time=1083] God bless you. Thanks again for tuning in. Have a great, great week and we hope to see you soon.
[time=1103] Peace will come confess and know that you are holy and know that you are holy and all will sing
[time=1125] out, hallelujah. We will cry out, hallelujah. Oh, we'll sing out, hallelujah. We will cry out, hallelujah.
[time=1155] All the hearts who I content and all will feel unworthy. All the heaven, nothing left. We'll know that you are holy.
[time=1186] And all will sing out, hallelujah. We will cry out, hallelujah. Oh, we'll sing out, hallelujah. We will cry out, hallelujah.
[time=1215] [MUSIC]
[time=1224] Will you sing us last chords with us? Shout out. Go on and scream it from the mountains. Go on and tell
[time=1238] it to the masses. He's gotten. He is God. Shout out. Go on and scream it from the mountains. Go on and tell
[time=1263] it to the masses. He is God. Again we sing, shout it. Shout out. Go on and scream it from the mountains. Go on and tell
[time=1288] it to the masses. He is God. Shout out. Go on and scream it from the mountains. Go on and tell it to the masses.
[time=1319] Yes, God. All right, we will sing out, hallelujah. And we will sing out, hallelujah. We will cry out, hallelujah. We will sing out, hallelujah.
[time=1348] And oh, we'll sing out, hallelujah. We will cry out, hallelujah. Oh, we'll sing out, hallelujah. We will cry out, hallelujah.
[time=1378] Amen. Amen. Clap for God. Then the truth. Wow. Thank you. Thank you, Bann. Thank you, Adam. Some of you may know, Adam, others, if you may not. Adam's part of our team here at Blackhawk
[time=1407] invests a lot of his time and energies into our student ministries leading worship and discipling other worship leaders. And I'm so thankful that he's here, Melissa. You want to, you want to feel old someday, sit down in the front row at your church and watch a gal lead worship who you, with your son, you remember her as you drop them both off at Kindergarten.
[time=1438] One day, a while ago, and here she is this morning, a gifted young lady who is a freshman at Ball State and getting ready to head off. I think they call it these days, studying abroad on her way to Australia. I'm thinking, where in the heck was studying abroad when I was in school in Australia? She's on her way to Australia for three or four months. She'll be back and we're so thankful for her and thankful that they were willing to do this.
[time=1467] That this morning, Amen. Amen. What a gift. Hey, we've been. Yeah, absolutely. Praise God.
[time=1473] Hey, we have been studying over the last couple of weeks, the character and the nature of our God. We find it beneficial. We find it healthy to study about the nature and character of our God, the better you and I understand him. The more clearly we know him. The better picture we have of him, the better for us to know.
[time=1497] Not only acknowledge his greatness and his uniqueness, but also better for you and I as we seek to imitate and follow after him. The scriptures are clear, my friends, that we are to be like him. You and I know that that's impossible, entirely impossible when it comes to really being like him. But nonetheless, God's word calls you and I in the way that we live and think and that which we value. The choices we make, God's word says with the help of the word of God,
[time=1527] with the help and assistance of the spirit of God and the encouragement of the people of God. We are to be moving in that direction like him. And what we've learned about him in these last two weeks is that our God is excessive.
[time=1543] He is by nature over the top. He is by nature, extreme in his character. He is lavish, excessive. We've looked at his lavish and excessive mercy. We've looked at his lavish and excessive grace.
[time=1560] Last week we spent some time looking at the lavish and extreme, excessive way in which he pursues you and me. How he never gives up on us. How he never forsakes us.
[time=1570] How whether it's bringing us to salvation or moving us towards sanctification, he is relentless in his pursuit of us. And you and I are to be excessively merciful, gracious, pursuant of others as we do our best with his help to be like him.
[time=1592] We've learned along the way that you and I can be a bit excessive ourselves. Now, I taught you a few weeks ago that our propensity toward excess I think is an indicator of the fact we were made in the image of God.
[time=1608] There's nothing wrong with the fact that we are like him, excessive by nature. It's just that in our sinfulness, that excessiveness has kind of gotten derailed, right? Our excessiveness tends to show itself in ways God never intended.
[time=1623] A friend of mine gave me an article here, I'll read it to you just a portion of it. ABC News reported recently, actually it was a couple years ago, diners, feast on the world's most expensive meal. How's that sound?
[time=1640] It took a big appetite and an even bigger bank account to get through tonight's meal at the Domé restaurant in Bangkok, Thailand. It was billed as the most expensive meal ever served. After 10 courses, and I'm telling you, I've got the menu here.
[time=1658] And anytime you're reading through a menu that's got mous-a-line of pâté and ostrich and mussels and things done with sheep, and you just kind of read through this thing, it's absolutely unbelievable stuff I can't even pronounce.
[time=1674] 10 courses prepared by some of the most famous chefs in the world, each course accompanied by its own rare wine. Each diner was then presented with a bill for $30,000 each. Listen, tax and tip not included.
[time=1693] Somebody do 15% or 30,000 real quick. So it just got a lot bigger. Wow. Worth every penny, German chef Heinz Winkler told the Associated Press, I believe the diners tonight will experience a culinary level never before seen. He told the Associated Press.
[time=1711] Deepak Ori, Labua's managing director and one of the events organizers admitted $30,000 is a lot to pay for a meal. Really. Shocking. When we look at dinner only, yes, it is expensive, but listen to this, he told the AP, but when you look at the whole experience, it is an experience of a lifetime.
[time=1738] Us and our excessive nature. I get this from a friend earlier in the week and it maybe was a day later that I get this from a friend here at Blackhawk. Proverbs 1532 in the message translation says, "An undisciplined self-willed life is what? puny."
[time=1761] But I know I love this, but an obedient, God-willed life is what? Say it. Spacious. It's excessive. It's big. It's over the top. It's everything and more you could have ever imagined.
[time=1776] In him. Spaciousness. Excess. Extreme. God's way. Today we look at a third and final part of the excessive nature and character of God. We could go on for weeks and weeks, but I'm so, so looking forward to next week when we will begin a study of the book of 1 Timothy. I hope you'll make note of that and I hope you'll be here.
[time=1802] It's an amazing book. Many of us on the team have been reading it for the last couple of months. Paul writes 1 Timothy to Timothy, a young pastor of a church in Ephesus, and I like to fancy myself as still being a young pastor, but whether I'm young or whether I'm old, I'm telling you this, my friends, there are things in this book that we as a church need to see and understand. There are things we need to wrestle with.
[time=1828] Great, great truth in this book of 1 Timothy and I can't wait to get to it, but today one last look at the excessive nature of God. Today we look at the fact that God is excessively generous.
[time=1842] That God is excessively kind, my friends. Our God is excessively lavishly over the top in his generosity.
[time=1853] And I want you to think about this this morning and I want you to think about it here just for a minute on your own and I may even have you just ask somebody nearby. Finish this sentence for me.
[time=1863] Just you fill in the word, okay? When you think about the generosity of God or when you think about the generosity of others, what is one word that for you kind of comes to mind that would be kind of a synonym, if you will, or it kind of defines generosity like this?
[time=1881] You know someone is being generous when they're willing to, just don't say anything, just keep it to yourself. Think of two or three words. You know that generosity is at work when you see someone doing this.
[time=1896] You get to exercise generosity when you're willing to just think about it. Get that word in your head or those two words or those three. One word that best describes the act of generosity.
[time=1914] I'm going to read two passages for you this morning as we start. The first coming in Romans chapter eight. And I want to just tell you the word, the word that came to my mind and I really think the word that in some ways best defines the act of generosity.
[time=1933] You'll find it in two different forms, but you'll find the word in both of these passages. I bet you'll be able to pick it out. Romans eight, thirty one and thirty two.
[time=1944] Look at this with me. It says there in Romans eight, thirty one, what then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?
[time=1956] He who did not spare his own son, but delivered him over for us all. How will he not also with him freely give us all things?
[time=1982] If you go back to the gospels, maybe it's been a while since you turned to this verse. Many of you know it, but turn. Would you to John 3 16?
[time=1991] What is this one word that so powerfully defines? So powerfully describes the act of generosity. Here you go. It says in John 3 16, for God so loved the world that he watched church.
[time=2008] Here it is, that he gave. God gave his only son. His only begotten son that whoever believes in him in that son shall not perish, but because of that giving, have eternal life.
[time=2026] I want you to think about that this morning with me. I'm going to ask you to think about a lot of things this morning. We're going to ask some questions today about generosity.
[time=2034] I hope you'll write them down. I hope you'll engage with me as we think through some things here together. He gave his only son so we could live.
[time=2044] The generosity, consider in that the generosity of God. He sacrificed, turned his back on, abandoned, let go of, relinquished.
[time=2060] Understand this, that in that moment when he gave his son, he allows every ounce of his divine wrath and judgment to be placed directly on his own son.
[time=2075] All the wrath, past, present and future placed on his own son as he hangs on that cross. You say how in the world, Kelly, is this generous?
[time=2086] Well, think with me. What makes it generous is that it's done for the benefit and gain of another.
[time=2094] Webster takes it a step further. That would be Miriam and not Steve, just in case you were confused there.
[time=2100] Webster defines it this way. Listen, so insightful. Webster says it's the willingness to give away something of value.
[time=2107] Okay, but then listen, value not only to the recipient, but to the giver as well. See, this defines generosity.
[time=2118] It's not generous for me to flip you a penny. You may need the penny and it may be of great value to you, but it's not of great value to me.
[time=2127] No, generosity is when something of great value is given away. Value not only to the recipient, but to the giver as well.
[time=2136] Well, think about this as you think about God and his generosity with his son. Value to the recipient? Oh, I think so.
[time=2146] Eternal life. Forgiveness of all sin. Value to the recipient? Yes.
[time=2156] Value to the giver was there value in this thing that got given. Oh my goodness, it was his son. Listen, it was his son from eternity past.
[time=2171] I said goodbye to a son in June after 18 years. One of the hardest things I've ever done. 18 measly years compared to eternity with his boy.
[time=2185] And it was a perfect eternity. There were no curfew issues. There were no tickets. There was no disrespect.
[time=2193] It was a perfect, blissful eternity past. All there was great value. Church in what he gave. Great value.
[time=2206] Question for you here. Again, write these down as we go. Question why, my friends, why was God so excessively generous toward us?
[time=2219] As it relates to the single greatest act of generosity ever, as it relates to the giving of his son, for God so loved the world that he gave his only son.
[time=2231] I want you to answer this question with me. Think about this. Why was God so excessively generous toward us?
[time=2238] The answer, as always, we want to turn to the Scriptures. Would you turn over to Mark, Matthew, Mark, the gospel of Mark, right before you get to Luke? Go to Mark 15, would you?
[time=2253] Here in Mark 15, we come to the gruesome and horrific scene of Christ's suffering on the cross.
[time=2264] As we come to verse 34, this unspeakable event is slowly winding down. Why was God so excessively generous toward us?
[time=2274] Well, let me show the answer to you right here in this text. It says in verse 34, it says, at the ninth hour, Jesus there on the cross, the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice.
[time=2288] Alloy, alloy, llama, sabachthani, which is translated, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[time=2298] Why have you forsaken me? Why have you done this? Why have you abandoned me? Look at verse 37.
[time=2307] The process continues on, now we come to the end, and here it is, what a verse, and Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his what? His last.
[time=2320] And the temple, look at this, he breathes his last, and at that moment, my friends, at that split second where he breathes his last, it says in 38, and the veil of the temple was torn in two from where? From top to bottom.
[time=2339] Some of you in the room understand the significance of this. Others, if you, maybe this is a chance for you to learn this and wrestle with this for the first time, this is the answer to why God would be so excessively generous with you and give up his only son.
[time=2358] And at the moment, he breathes his last, the veil in the temple, where the people of God would worship, there was this massive veil.
[time=2371] And the veil, watch, the veil separated the holy of holies, the presence of God, from the who? From the people.
[time=2382] In that day, before this moment, you couldn't get to God. You had to go through your priest, the high priest would make sacrifices inside the holy of holies, it was the way that got done.
[time=2397] And it was a huge deal that that high priest would have access to that, but everybody else is on the outside looking in, and now at the moment that this generous gift is given.
[time=2411] Boom, and don't miss that phrase from the top, who could have reached it? Nobody. God, God wanted to be with you so badly.
[time=2427] God longs for relationships so deeply with his people that he acts excessively generous and gives a gift that opens the door for us to live not distant from, but intimately with him. Amen?
[time=2445] This is a great truth. God wants to be with you. God graciously gave up his son to get you. It's his nature. He's excessively kind, lavish and over the top with his generosity.
[time=2462] Now think about this for a minute. Think about all that God has excessively given you. Now let's just kind of keep going forward with this picture of our generous God and now his ongoing relationship with you and I.
[time=2477] Think about all that God has excessively given. Think with me for a moment about all that is his. All that he owns. All that he possesses. I wrote this down for you. You can follow along.
[time=2489] He owns, he possesses all the healing, all comes from him. He owns, he possesses all of the mercy, all of the peace, all of the hope, all of the forgiveness, all of the blessing, all of the comfort that exists, he owns.
[time=2508] Then there's his son, then there's his word, then there's his Holy Spirit and he gives us all of the above in abundance, doesn't he? Doesn't he?
[time=2521] Haven't you experienced all the above and haven't you experienced it freely? You write a check for any of it? No.
[time=2533] We didn't earn it. We could never have warranted any of it and we certainly didn't deserve it. And he has withheld nothing.
[time=2543] All this. All of it. His to keep or share. All of it. His to hoard or to give. All of it is to stockpile or to distribute for God, so love the world that he wants. Say it, Church.
[time=2563] He gave. He was generous. Why so generous? Why so generous? He has from day one wanted to be in relationship with his people. What has he generously given? You name it. He's offered it. He has given it away to you.
[time=2580] And thirdly, let's look at this. Write this down. Would you? What makes his? I want you to see this. Not only for what it says about God, but I want you to see this for what it means for you and I in our pursuit of generous living.
[time=2593] What makes his generosity, my friends, so special? What is it about God's generosity that makes it so unlike anything, so unlike anyone else? What is it about his kindness that is so unique?
[time=2609] Look with me at Romans 5, if you would, here in Paul's letter to the church at Rome in the in the fifth chapter. He goes to great lengths to describe for us the generous love of God.
[time=2624] Romans 5, you'll see it here in verses 6 through 10. Let me read this to you. And as I read through this, I want you to note four words that I want to draw your attention to. You might want to underline these words. You might want to circle them.
[time=2638] You might want to circle them or highlight them. Four very powerful words that describe the generous and kind love of God. Romans 5, 6, 4, while we were still helpless at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
[time=2658] For one will hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die. But God, verse 8, but God demonstrates his own unique love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=2677] Much more than having now been justified by his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through him. For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his son, much more having been reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
[time=2699] I hope you picked up those words. I hope you sensed as you read through that. My goodness, look what God did. God, God generously, God generously demonstrates his love. He's so kind toward us, but his generosity and his love comes toward the helpless.
[time=2717] It comes toward the ungodly, it comes toward the sinner, and it comes toward the enemy. For a righteous man, one of us might dare even to offer this, but God offers with generosity all of his love for those who are helpless ungodly sinners and enemies.
[time=2740] I want to just take a moment here because I don't want you to miss the, I don't want you to miss the importance of these four words chosen by God here in this passage, and I think chosen for a reason.
[time=2752] The word helpless, write this down. The word helpless here describes one who is far from God completely because of the distance between his heart and God's.
[time=2762] This word helpless describes one who is just utterly, absolutely clueless, spiritually not even a trace of activity on the radar screen. This person is just absolutely utterly helpless, gone void zero, nothing going on there, helpless.
[time=2784] Yes, this is amazing when we think about God's movement toward that person, but don't forget we're to be like God, so now we're talking about your movement toward this person and your willingness to be generous and kind toward the helpless.
[time=2802] Let's go on. He brings a second category of individual into this, and that's the ungodly. Write that down. There's the helpless who are just spiritually clueless, far and distant from God. The ungodly are the undesirable.
[time=2815] Who do you know in this category? The unattractive. These are the ugly ones. These are the difficult ones. These are the ungodly who because of their failure, because of their struggle, because of their issues.
[time=2829] They just represent this basic picture of, "No, thank you, just stay over there." And he says, "No, no." No, he was generous toward them as well. He demonstrates his own love and that he pursues them too.
[time=2847] And so are you to do the same. The helpless, the ungodly. He goes on, the sinners.
[time=2857] You know what the word there means? The word there means repeat offenders. I'm looking at a bunch, and you're all looking at one.
[time=2871] These are people who are characterized in some ways by their ongoing sin and struggle.
[time=2878] He says, "Be generous toward the helpless, the ungodly, the sinners." And then look at that last one, the enemies.
[time=2884] Make sure you understand this church. These are those who aggressively are hostile toward God.
[time=2891] These aren't just the folks that say, "Hey, it's okay for you, but not for me." No, these are the ones who come after you because of what you believe.
[time=2898] These are the ones who are angry at you because of what you believe. These are the ones who are against you.
[time=2904] Their posture is one of aggression. And our response to them, according to Romans 5, is to be like our gods who in his generosity gave his love to the helpless, to the ungodly, to the sinners, to the enemies.
[time=2921] So you and I are supposed to be like God.
[time=2928] So here's some questions for you that I hope you'll interact with, honestly. I hope you'll interact with these questions in your own heart in this moment.
[time=2935] I hope you'll interact with these questions as the days go by this week with a trusted friend. I hope you'll talk about maybe these questions.
[time=2942] I'm sure they'll be referenced in this week's digging deeper. I hope you'll access that material, come Wednesday, and use it for your own continued study and times of devotion.
[time=2953] There you go. With all that being said, let me just ask you honestly to interact with this right now. Why then do we withhold generosity?
[time=2965] Why are so many of us in this room so many times in our lives? Why are we so unwilling to be generous?
[time=2980] What goes on inside of you? What happens?
[time=2985] Why, with our time and our talent and our treasure, our resources, why are we so committed at times to holding onto it rather than sharing it with others?
[time=2999] Why are we at times so committed to keeping it instead of giving it away? Why do we withhold generosity? Why do we hold so tightly?
[time=3011] Here's one for you. Why are we on so many fronts more characterized by what we're trying to get than by what we're wanting to give?
[time=3023] A little exercise we did first hour. It was really just an idea that came to my mind. I think it was rich, though, and had some great conversations with some people afterwards, so I'll just give it to you.
[time=3033] Right now in your mind or on a piece of paper, I really would like you to do this. Start making a list, draw a little line down the middle of your paper there, and after you draw that line down the middle of the paper on one side, I want you to make a list of the things that right now in your life, you're planning.
[time=3049] You're making plans to get. Just think about that.
[time=3055] The things in your life right now, think about work, think about the house, think about your car, think about the garage, think about your hobby, think about just think about right now, the things in your life that you are actively planning, thinking about getting.
[time=3070] And I just want you to start writing those things down. And as you write those things down, and I'm not saying all of that's evil, okay? It's not the point of the exercise.
[time=3080] I just want you to look at your list, write down all the things that you're planning on getting.
[time=3087] And then after you've done that for a while today or tomorrow at some point, I want you to come back to the other side of that piece of paper, and I want you to write down the things you're actively planning these days on giving.
[time=3099] And I just want you to look at that list and allow God to show you what that tells you about you and me.
[time=3114] What are you planning on getting? What are you actively these days planning on giving?
[time=3123] And let's see what God will do. Would you bow your head? Would you just close your eyes and just in a moment of quiet right here before we go?
[time=3131] I want to just, I want to pray for you this morning, and I want to pray for you along the lines of just a couple things I jotted down here.
[time=3140] Please listen close and just kind of track with me as I talk you through this.
[time=3146] Three barriers, my friends, I believe that there are a number of listed three here, barriers to generosity in your life.
[time=3155] I believe many of you, because I know you, I believe many of you in this room want to be generous and kind.
[time=3160] You've experienced the kindness of our God, and you would love to be characterized by a generosity back toward him and others, but there are things that get in your way.
[time=3174] And so I want to just pray for you on these fronts. One thing that comes to mind is that many of you struggle with generosity because you're never content.
[time=3183] You just struggle with being content because when you're not content and when you always want more, when what you have is never enough.
[time=3196] When you lay awake at night and get up early thinking about and working towards somehow getting more, when you're never content, you always want.
[time=3206] And when you're always wanting, you're not thinking about giving. And so Father in Heaven I pray for my friends this morning.
[time=3215] I pray for those watching on the broadcast to sense these very things in their hearts as well.
[time=3220] Oh God, would you bring the contentment and the satisfaction that only you can bring?
[time=3226] Would you help us understand when enough's enough? Would you help us understand when to stop the grasping and the pursuing?
[time=3234] Oh God, would you help us to rest in what you have provided?
[time=3240] Would you help us God please to be satisfied in your Son and in the life that He has given and the opportunities that sit before us?
[time=3253] There are others of you in the room and you struggle with generosity because you view life as a competition.
[time=3261] You don't know where this came from and you may have come from years ago, it may have come from, you're upbringing, it may have come from an incident,
[time=3268] but you would rather win and keep acquiring than lose with quotes around it and bless someone.
[time=3278] And when you view life as a competition and when it's always about beating the next guy, when it's always about looking better than her,
[time=3286] when it's always about having more and somehow in your acquisitions and your purchases,
[time=3293] looking or sounding or appearing better you lose on the generosity front because you don't have time for it.
[time=3303] Father in heaven I pray for my friends in the room who would struggle with this and I pray God that you would in your Holy Spirit would help them slow down.
[time=3313] God I pray that you would bring perspective to their lives, that they would see this not as a game and a race but God as an opportunity to walk slowly with you
[time=3325] and see the opportunities that you've put around them not to get more but to give that which you've so generously provided.
[time=3336] Some of you struggle with contentment, some struggle with the spirit of competition.
[time=3342] Others of you in the room, third barrier is sin, patterns of sin, unconfessed sin.
[time=3352] And I say this to you just to really encourage you because I want you to see again this morning and realize that all of that,
[time=3358] all sin and patterns of sin and unconfessed sin, all of it leads to a hard heart and I think you know this but I'll tell it to you, hard hearts aren't very kind.
[time=3369] Hard hearts aren't very generous and so whatever sin there is, whatever patterns of unforgiveness, whatever patterns of bitterness,
[time=3380] whatever's going on in your heart and soul and maybe it's been going on for a long, long time.
[time=3386] I would just want to give you the chance this morning to confess that.
[time=3390] Oh God I pray that you would give my brothers and sisters the courage to confess those things that need to be confessed.
[time=3398] God that they would move away from their sin and iniquity.
[time=3401] God that they would ask for help and stop at nothing to pursue honesty and genuineness before you.
[time=3409] This God has when hard hearts become soft and soft hearts are giving tender hearts and this is what we would desire.
[time=3420] Father I am grateful for the privilege of being able to just share these truths this morning.
[time=3426] I pray that you would in that divine and miraculous way that only you can.
[time=3431] I pray that you would bring these things to life in the lives of my friends here in the days to come.
[time=3438] May there be a willingness and a readiness to live generously.
[time=3443] That maybe in some ways is new and fresh and unique to us.
[time=3450] Maybe move us in directions God and take us places with our generosity we never would have dreamed.
[time=3457] God allow us to let go of those things that we hold on to so tightly.
[time=3461] Allow us to lay hold of you and your son and may that laying hold of him inspire us to be more and more like you.
[time=3471] We pray all this. God we ask for all this help.
[time=3475] We commit to pursue these things and we are grateful this morning for the privilege to pray these prayers
[time=3482] in the name of your son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and all the people in the room agreed and said amen.
