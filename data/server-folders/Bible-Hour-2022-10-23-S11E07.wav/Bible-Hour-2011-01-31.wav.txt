[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] It's great to be with you and I say that every week and I'm just reminded periodically as I read the emails and letters that so many of you in our viewing audience send each and every week, I'm reminded of how much I mean that.
[time=48] I really am thankful to get to spend this time with each and every one of you.
[time=52] And I know from all the years that I've spent here as part of the Bible Hour team, I know that there are literally thousands of you who watch each and every week.
[time=61] And each of you have unique stories.
[time=64] Each of you find yourself at different places and stages of life, each of you.
[time=69] Tune in to find hope and comfort and inspiration and guidance from the one thing that gives us hope and guidance and inspiration.
[time=78] And that is the Word of God.
[time=80] And we're so thankful to be able to bring the Word of God to you, I'm so thankful to be able to be here with you.
[time=86] And I can't wait for you to hear today's message.
[time=90] And really, I can't wait for you to hear what's coming in the weeks and probably months to come.
[time=96] We begin a new study today.
[time=98] And a side note is this, if ever there was a time for you to come and join us live and in person, I always like to invite people to come at the beginning of a study.
[time=107] And we are beginning now to study the book of First Timothy.
[time=112] And I'd love for you to come and be a part of this study live and in person with us.
[time=116] We'd love to meet you.
[time=117] We'd love to come alongside you in your life.
[time=120] But First Timothy is really unique.
[time=122] And here's what I mean.
[time=123] It's a letter from the Apostle Paul to a young pastor in a pretty big church in a huge place called Ephesus.
[time=132] Timothy's got his first job, if you will.
[time=135] And he's encountering all kinds of struggles and all kinds of issues.
[time=138] And Paul writes to help Timothy know what real or true church, if you will, should look like.
[time=147] What should the church be like?
[time=148] How should the church function?
[time=150] What are the priorities that the church should have?
[time=153] And not only does he address it to the church, but he addresses it to Timothy.
[time=157] And so all throughout this book, there are clear truths and there are clear admonitions from Paul to Timothy the pastor.
[time=166] So it's not only about how the church is to function, it's how the pastor is to function.
[time=170] And so I'm finding personally in this study, some great points of application.
[time=174] And I hope some opportunities for real learning on my part.
[time=178] So it's going to be a great study.
[time=180] True church, God's designed for the body of Christ.
[time=184] And I hope you'll come and I hope you'll be encouraged.
[time=187] And we're so thankful for you.
[time=189] Hope you'll come soon.
[time=190] God bless you.
[time=191] Have a great week.
[time=192] [MUSIC]
[time=204] [audience applauds] [audience applauds]
[time=218] [MUSIC - 32 seconds]
[time=255] Let's stand together and sing that again.
[time=258] [MUSIC - 275 seconds]
[time=544] [APPLAUSE]
[time=551] Amen. Amen.
[time=553] Everybody said, amen.
[time=555] Boy, you sounded great, Church.
[time=557] You sounded really good.
[time=559] I want to jump right in this morning.
[time=561] We begin a new journey together this morning.
[time=564] We begin a study of the book of 1 Timothy.
[time=567] And you know, it's what we do around here.
[time=569] We just so enjoy the privilege that God's given us to study God's Word.
[time=575] We believe that it is life-changing.
[time=578] We believe that the Scriptures are life-altering.
[time=581] We believe they give us hope and guidance and direction.
[time=584] We believe the Word of God is perfect.
[time=586] We make no qualms about it, no apologies for it.
[time=589] We love the privilege God gives us to study and look at and glean from his Word.
[time=594] And so today we begin a new study.
[time=596] It'll probably take us a while, but that's okay.
[time=598] It's the Word, so it's always relevant.
[time=601] It's always important.
[time=602] It's always helpful.
[time=604] And we come to the book of 1 Timothy, a letter, a letter written from the Apostle Paul to Timothy who was pastoring a church.
[time=615] And I want to just say a couple of things here before we jump in.
[time=618] Just by way of kind of introduction, just to kind of set the stage a bit, maybe even behind the scenes a little bit.
[time=624] I want you to understand some things as we jump into this letter from the Apostle Paul to his true child in the faith.
[time=634] Look at that.
[time=635] You can see that in verse 1 and 2.
[time=637] Paul, an Apostle of Christ to look at verse 2 to Timothy, my true child in the faith.
[time=647] Timothy's pastoring a church in an amazing place.
[time=651] And we'll get to that in a moment.
[time=653] But I want to say a couple of things here about the church in this letter.
[time=657] And I want to say a couple of things about Timothy and Paul.
[time=660] Really, really important.
[time=661] First of all, the church.
[time=663] Paul, most of you know, others of you might not, but Paul, because of the mission that God had put him on.
[time=670] And because of what God had done in his life, Paul loved.
[time=673] Paul was passionate about, Paul was called by God to really help birth the church as we know it.
[time=681] God worked through Paul in amazing ways.
[time=683] Paul cared deeply about the church.
[time=687] Paul knew, listen, Paul understood that the church then and the church today.
[time=696] Paul knew the church was supposed to make a difference in the world.
[time=701] Paul knew that the way God had designed it.
[time=707] Paul knew that the way God had put it together in who the church was to be a life-giving, life-changing, life-transforming
[time=717] instrument of God in the culture that God put it in wherever he had put that church.
[time=723] And I want to just say that to you this morning because the same thing is still true today.
[time=728] Amen?
[time=729] And as we say, amen, I just want to remind you, or I just want to ask you, are we?
[time=738] The church, you know it's not the building.
[time=740] You know it's not the address.
[time=741] You know it's you on your block in your cubicle.
[time=749] On that ball field or court, wherever you go, we are because
[time=756] of what's been given us to be this difference-making, life-changing, life-altering entity that is inspired and empowered by God to make it.
[time=767] Paul cared deeply about the church.
[time=770] Timothy's pastoring a church, it had some issues.
[time=773] And he wants to make sure that through this letter, really through the pastoral epistles, first and second Timothy and Titus, he wants to make sure that God's designed for the church is being honored.
[time=787] Where they don't understand it, he wants to make sure they get it.
[time=790] Where they're dropping the ball, he wants to make sure they pick it up.
[time=794] But Paul loved the church.
[time=795] He understands the great calling the church had been given.
[time=798] And you and I need to be reminded today that that great calling is the same today.
[time=804] And we need to make sure that as we do church, as you and I live throughout our faith, we need to make sure that as we look at 1 Timothy here, that what we're doing and how we're doing it, the priorities that we have are aligned with God's great design for the body of Christ.
[time=824] Now, Paul and Timothy, my true child in the faith, I just want to make sure you don't miss that.
[time=831] He really, really loved Timothy.
[time=835] He loved him like a son and many of you in the room understand what it means to love a son, to love a daughter.
[time=843] You understand the empathy.
[time=845] You understand the affection.
[time=846] You understand the care and the concern.
[time=850] And I just think it's a really, really special relationship.
[time=853] And it's worth noting that Paul realized there was a lot at stake.
[time=858] You with me?
[time=859] Paul knew that things weren't as they should be.
[time=862] Paul knew that Timothy was in charge.
[time=864] Paul knew that this thing could go one way or the other.
[time=867] Paul knew there was a lot at stake.
[time=873] I was driving back and forth yesterday between Crawford Road and East Lansing.
[time=880] Had my son had the privilege yesterday of spending some time with my son in the car coming back and forth between Fort Wayne and Michigan State.
[time=890] And many of you have had these conversations.
[time=892] So for a lot of you, this isn't anything new.
[time=894] But for me, it was, again, another new reality.
[time=898] You know, we had a lot of conversations between, you know, one and eighteen.
[time=903] Now all of a sudden, the conversations that we're having, it struck me last night, that there's a lot at stake.
[time=912] There's a lot of decisions that now get made.
[time=916] There are a lot of directions that now get chosen.
[time=920] Are you with me?
[time=922] Now, all of a sudden, as you drive and talk, now you begin to get this sense that, boy, everything I say, and every, every email I send, every text I fire off, man, I want it to be the best I can offer because there's a lot going on here.
[time=941] And this isn't thirteen anymore.
[time=944] This is the rest of their life.
[time=948] And I look at what Paul does here with Timothy.
[time=951] We've been as elders and staff.
[time=953] We've been reading 1 Timothy for a few months now.
[time=956] And I just look and I sense and I see the love that he has for him.
[time=960] And he knows there's a lot at stake and he's not there.
[time=963] And so he gives him these things that he wants desperately for Timothy to hang on to.
[time=971] Lay hold of, live by.
[time=974] And I really hope that you'll be encouraged as we look at this together.
[time=978] Imagine with me, if you will, true church, God's designed for the body.
[time=984] Imagine with me, if you will, a young 29-year-old pastor who finds himself in his very first ministry opportunity ever.
[time=993] This is how it was with Timothy.
[time=995] He's been given the responsibility of leading and loving and teaching a large body of young believers in a thriving first-century metropolis called Ephesus.
[time=1008] A city that would have, a metropolis Ephesus that would have rivaled a combination of our modern day Las Vegas, New York City, and Miami's South Beach.
[time=1019] This is what Ephesus would have looked like.
[time=1022] It's what it would have sounded like.
[time=1026] A huge economic, educational, and high society setting mixed with complete
[time=1033] and absolute debauchery, immorality, and promiscuity.
[time=1039] There was false teaching rising up.
[time=1042] There was rebellious women in the church causing problems.
[time=1048] There was all kinds of struggles, widows that weren't being provided for,
[time=1055] people who were struggling with how to deal with their wealth.
[time=1060] It was an amazing setting.
[time=1062] I think you see a picture on the screen here of Timothy scratching his head.
[time=1065] There you go.
[time=1066] That's what it would have looked like.
[time=1067] That's kind of what it was like.
[time=1071] Timothy finding himself in the midst of an unbelievable ministry calling.
[time=1076] Vegas, New York City, Miami's South Beach, young believers.
[time=1081] Wow.
[time=1082] Now I share with you the literal, very real context within which Timothy found
[time=1088] himself to help you sense what he was up against, but at the same time, the truth is that Paul writes the letter to Timothy so that anyone,
[time=1099] anywhere, doesn't matter where you are, doesn't matter who you are.
[time=1104] It doesn't matter where, whoever you are, if you are in the church leadership endeavor,
[time=1112] he writes so that anyone anywhere could see and understand clearly God's design for how the church is to function.
[time=1120] How it's supposed to work.
[time=1122] What it's supposed to look like as it, the church fulfills God's clear calling
[time=1128] to be this redemptive difference-making, life-giving instrument of God.
[time=1134] Look with me, if you would, at 1 Timothy 3.15.
[time=1137] Today we'll do some overview of just a couple of major themes that we'll see as we study.
[time=1143] Then next week we'll come back and jump right into the text.
[time=1146] But look with me.
[time=1147] What a great speaking of overview.
[time=1149] What a great verse.
[time=1150] 1 Timothy 3.15.
[time=1153] It gives you really the purpose behind Paul writing.
[time=1157] It says, I'm writing in verse 14.
[time=1160] It says, I'm writing these things to you.
[time=1162] Timothy, hoping to come to you before long, but verse 15.
[time=1165] In case I am delayed, I write so that you will know how one ought to conduct himself
[time=1173] in the household of God.
[time=1175] There you have it.
[time=1176] How should we conduct ourselves in the household of God, which is the church?
[time=1183] The church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.
[time=1191] We need to understand and see these things, church.
[time=1194] You and I need to understand and see these things that Paul has written so we understand
[time=1200] how we should conduct ourselves in this greatest of all endeavors.
[time=1205] Now there's a unique component to this study that I want to just talk about here real
[time=1211] openly and real honestly right from the beginning.
[time=1214] I don't typically, and if you've been around here at all, you know this.
[time=1218] I don't like to talk about myself.
[time=1221] I'd much rather just take this and explain it to you.
[time=1225] But the fact of the matter is this book is written, this letter is written to a what?
[time=1232] To a pastor.
[time=1235] That's just how this one plays out.
[time=1237] This letter is written to a pastor.
[time=1240] And there are some very personal things.
[time=1243] There are some very important things that Paul communicates to a pastor, to an elder.
[time=1250] We've got a team of elders here at Blackhawk that I'm so thankful for.
[time=1254] I get to be a part of that.
[time=1256] This letter is written to a pastor.
[time=1261] Now this letter is also, I mean while it's written to a pastor, there are clear implications as we make our way through.
[time=1267] I'll show you a couple of them today.
[time=1269] There are some clear implications and some very clear words spoken to you.
[time=1274] To the church, to the family, if you will.
[time=1277] But I find myself even as I've prepared for today, it's a little bit of a balancing act because there's just a lot in here about how I am to how we are as elders, how we are to lead.
[time=1289] And I'm not apologizing for this.
[time=1291] I think it's important that you as a church understand God's design for those who lead.
[time=1298] It's important that you would understand God's heart for those who find themselves in this role serving this purpose.
[time=1306] And I want to share with you some things today from my heart and I'll try to keep sharing things with you and we'll share some learnings that are pointed toward me and those who lead as we study.
[time=1317] But I also want to make sure you know it's really a great chance for both of us.
[time=1320] Those who lead and those who follow, for those who are pastoring and those who are a part of the flock.
[time=1327] You and me.
[time=1329] Alright, personally, here we go.
[time=1330] Let's just kind of bounce off that.
[time=1332] And this morning I want to show you some things that I've been encouraged by.
[time=1336] Very personally, I'll add.
[time=1338] Let me start to share with all of you this morning some of the encouragement and instruction that I've received
[time=1345] from this letter to a pastor as I've been reading and preparing for our times together.
[time=1349] Some powerful reminders from 1 Timothy.
[time=1354] As I live and as our elders live daily with the responsibility and calling to help love and lead and teach the church.
[time=1365] There you go, I hope you get a pin out, I hope you'll write some of these things down.
[time=1368] Reminders from 1 Timothy to those who lead.
[time=1373] And let me start by saying this.
[time=1376] While pastoring, while doing what I do can be and is oftentimes an absolute joy and blessing.
[time=1393] I want to make sure you understand that I'm saying that.
[time=1395] First hour I didn't say that.
[time=1396] I jumped into the flip side of that and felt like it got a little negative.
[time=1400] I want to make sure you understand.
[time=1402] I really love my life.
[time=1404] I love what God allows me to be a part of.
[time=1408] I love this family.
[time=1409] I love the years God has given us here.
[time=1412] I'm so thankful for the joy and blessing that so oftentimes characterizes what I get to do and be a part of here with you.
[time=1423] Having said that, I want you to know that being a pastor can also be extremely lonely,
[time=1430] extremely painful, and at times very discouraging.
[time=1435] Being a pastor, being in leadership in the local church can at times be extremely lonely, painful, and discouraging.
[time=1442] There have been days.
[time=1446] Not a lot, but there have been days when I would rather quit and just go away.
[time=1456] Then face the attacks and/or the rejection from the angry critic, the wounded heart, or the disappointed member.
[time=1468] That's just reality.
[time=1471] It's just hard sometimes to be in this dynamic and there are days when it gets really, really difficult.
[time=1479] When I get to those days, I'm reminded of Paul's words to Timothy right here in this book that we're about to study.
[time=1488] We'll come to this in the weeks to come, but I want to just read it to you right now.
[time=1492] It says in 1st Timothy 1, 18, "This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son,
[time=1498] in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you fight the good..."
[time=1506] What? Say it. Fight.
[time=1509] That by them you fight the good fight, Timothy, keeping faith in a good conscience.
[time=1517] I don't know if you realized it there, but Paul just referred to a life in ministry as a fight.
[time=1524] Then there are times when it feels like a battle.
[time=1528] There are times when it feels bloody. There are times when it feels violent. There are times when it feels very, very scary.
[time=1539] When your best efforts...
[time=1542] Listen, when your best efforts just aren't good enough or when your poor effort brings turmoil and confusion.
[time=1554] It's difficult.
[time=1557] When friends turn away and leave your side, when lies in gossip or spread, it's difficult.
[time=1568] It feels like a fight. It can be discouraging.
[time=1573] When speaking truth, when teaching the truth, and I think most of you would understand this, sometimes teaching the truth isn't really popular.
[time=1583] Sometimes I stand up here and just get looks that could kill.
[time=1590] Sometimes I get emails on Monday that are commensurate with those looks.
[time=1596] Sometimes saying what's true according to God.
[time=1600] Sometimes I want to just say, "Look, I didn't write it. I'm just telling you what he said." Sometimes preaching and teaching the truth is not well received.
[time=1611] It's difficult when the actions of mean-spirited people affect not only you, but your family.
[time=1618] I am bolstered and buoyed up. I'm telling you, I'm encouraged by the words of Paul when he reminds his son in the faith, Timothy.
[time=1626] He says, "Hey, you keep fighting the good fight.
[time=1631] You keep the faith." I love what he says in the second letter to Timothy.
[time=1638] Go to 2 Timothy 2. Go ahead. Turn over there, would you?
[time=1642] Go to 2 Timothy 2. You see the same idea. You see the same mindset.
[time=1646] You see the same reality being painted. It says there in 2 Timothy 2, 3.
[time=1651] Suffer what? Hardship. He's just saying, "Look, this is just reality.
[time=1657] Suffer hardship with me as a good what?" Soldier. Oh, I see it as a fight, isn't it?
[time=1663] It is a battle. Suffer hardship with me as a good soldier of Christ Jesus, Timothy.
[time=1669] No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life.
[time=1675] This is a high calling. Fight the good fight. Keep the faith.
[time=1681] 2 Timothy 4. Go over a few more pages, would you?
[time=1685] Don't know when we'll get to 2 Timothy, but I wanted to show you what it said.
[time=1689] 2 Timothy 4. Look at verse 3.
[time=1692] 2 Timothy 4. "For the time will come." Timothy, listen.
[time=1696] He says, "The time will come when they the people will not endure sound doctrine, but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires, and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths."
[time=1716] But you, Timothy, you young pastor, be sober in all things.
[time=1723] Stay clear. You understand sobriety, right?
[time=1727] Stay clear in all things and endure. Hang in there.
[time=1734] Timothy, endure hardship. Do the work of an evangelist.
[time=1738] Fulfill your ministry.
[time=1743] Being a pastor can be extremely lonely, painful, and discouraging, and yet the words from the spiritual father Paul to his son in the faith,
[time=1753] Timothy bring great hope and great inspiration and great encouragement.
[time=1758] I hope you see that, and I hope you understand that.
[time=1761] It's true and I'm thankful that I get encouraged from words like this.
[time=1767] And I want to tell you again, again, by and large, over 15 years of being here, you all have made ministry easy.
[time=1775] By and large, you all have been a loving and gracious family.
[time=1779] I told you years ago when we came here that our prayer was our kids would never resent the ministry.
[time=1784] Our kids today, years later, love this place.
[time=1789] They love you, and they love what Dad gets to be a part of, so I'm grateful.
[time=1794] Another thing that you see, as you read through this book, and as you listen to Paul encourage and admonish and exhort Timothy,
[time=1804] immaturity can hurt the pastoring effort.
[time=1809] And you're thinking, no kidding.
[time=1811] Immaturity can hurt the pastoring effort, so keep growing.
[time=1817] I love what it says there in 1 Timothy 4, 12.
[time=1821] Many of you have memorized this.
[time=1823] Many of our youth, many of our students have locked on to this as they should, but don't forget this was written to the pastor of the church.
[time=1831] This was written to the one who was leading.
[time=1834] Let no one look down on your youthfulness.
[time=1837] Right there in that first sentence, what you see is that youthfulness is something that if you're not careful can be looked down upon.
[time=1846] You have to handle your youthfulness wisely.
[time=1850] He says, Timothy, pastor, leader, don't let them look down on your youthfulness,
[time=1856] but rather in your speech, conduct, love, faith and purity, show yourself, Timothy, show yourself an example of those who believe.
[time=1867] Immaturity can hurt the pastoring effort.
[time=1870] I know this all too well, and that's just the truth.
[time=1876] If you've been here for five years, if you've been here beyond five years, this will be a repeat.
[time=1881] It's just a story I tell every five years.
[time=1883] It's just worth telling, and it's just a great example of this, and I could tell story after story after story, but there I was in the very first church I ever got to be a pastor in, a buddy of mine.
[time=1894] Right out of the gate decided we're kind of co-passoring this church, and we wanted to do well, and we wanted to serve our people and encourage them, so we called a work day.
[time=1904] Everybody come and we'll work around the property, we'll work in the church, we'll clean it, we'll paint it, it'll be a great day.
[time=1910] So he and I figured we should get there early.
[time=1912] It'd be the first ones there to welcome everyone, and we're there in the worship center.
[time=1916] It's kind of a smaller church, couple of 250 people.
[time=1920] Kind of a nice room, and at the foot of the aisle here, there's this old table, and both he and I had always thought, what was the deal with this old table?
[time=1929] There's like hymnals underneath one of the legs that was too short.
[time=1933] It was shabby, it was dirty.
[time=1935] We're thinking, hey, we'll just start out by beginning to clean up the worship center.
[time=1939] Let's take that whole table and get rid of it.
[time=1941] So I mean, it was literally falling apart almost as we picked it up.
[time=1944] We walk out to the parking lot, to the backside fence, there's the big dumpster.
[time=1948] We take that table and just throw that thing in the dumpster.
[time=1951] It's kind of a full dumpster, so it doesn't go all the way in.
[time=1954] And so he says, hey, get up there and, you know, stomp that thing down.
[time=1958] So I get up on the dumpster, I'm up on the back when I was young and spry.
[time=1962] I'm on the edge of this dumpster.
[time=1964] And he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, right there.
[time=1966] And here's this old table kind of sorta in, sorta out.
[time=1969] And all of a sudden there's a truck coming into the parking lot.
[time=1972] And it's about four of the deacons.
[time=1974] It's four deacons.
[time=1975] They're all in one truck together.
[time=1977] And they come driving back to this dumpster.
[time=1979] And as they're coming, I'm like waving.
[time=1981] And I jump and I boom.
[time=1983] And I shatter this old dirty, rickety table and legs sticking out and it goes down in.
[time=1989] And I'm like, yeah, this is good.
[time=1991] When they drive up, the looks on their faces, it looked like we literally thought something.
[time=1998] Like they were coming to tell us something had happened.
[time=2000] I mean, they were like faces were white.
[time=2002] As they stared at me in the dumpster and my friend having just destroyed the table because
[time=2009] you see the table was made almost a hundred years earlier by the grandpa of one of the
[time=2017] deacons and had been carried in by the deacon board 50 years earlier to that very church
[time=2024] and sat in that spot and never before had it ever left that spot.
[time=2030] How am I?
[time=2031] How is I doing right then?
[time=2036] That didn't go so well.
[time=2037] At work they got off to a bad start.
[time=2041] Bad start.
[time=2042] There have been times when I've had to let people go and have done that immaturly.
[time=2054] I've done it in ways that lacked wisdom and it's hurt people and it's hurt us and it's
[time=2064] hurt me.
[time=2067] There's times when I've spoken in anger instead of wisdom.
[time=2076] There's times where I didn't follow what God's Word said and as a leader I've been
[time=2082] quick to speak and quick to anger instead of being slow to speak and slow to anger.
[time=2090] I'll tell you there's times when I've hit send and I should have hit what, delete.
[time=2103] My immaturity has hurt us at times.
[time=2107] It really has and yet I read in 1 Timothy and I'm reminded that in my speech and in my
[time=2115] conduct and my love, faith and purity God can redeem my youthful weaknesses.
[time=2122] He can grow me and allow me to actually be an example to this family, to those who believe.
[time=2131] And I just hope and pray that he's doing that.
[time=2133] I'm hoping and trying for those weaknesses to become strengths.
[time=2138] I'm hoping for those mistakes to be minimal but I just find great hope and promise as
[time=2145] a leader to know that he can redeem my youthfulness and he can redeem yours.
[time=2149] I know this is aimed at the pastor but it's okay to grab hold here of some application
[time=2155] for you, you and your youthfulness.
[time=2158] How's your speech?
[time=2159] How's your love, faith, purity, conduct?
[time=2162] These are things that should set you apart as an example of someone who believes.
[time=2170] So it gets difficult at times and you want to quit but you find great hope in Paul's words to Timothy to fight the good fight and to endure.
[time=2180] You realize that your immaturity can hurt the effort and then yet at the same time you realize God's working through that immaturity to grow you in your faith.
[time=2189] Number three, I wrote this down, just some more gleanings from Paul's words to Timothy.
[time=2195] I just wrote it down this way, "Who am I trying to please?
[time=2198] Anybody who knows me knows I've been on a journey over the last five years really trying to repent from a sinful addiction in my life called people pleasing."
[time=2209] And God has been helping me and growing me in this way.
[time=2212] I think God helps and grows many leaders who struggle with this and I want to just draw your attention if I could to 1 Timothy 4-6.
[time=2220] I wonder if you'll pick this up as we read.
[time=2223] I'll just tell you what it says, "Who am I trying to please?" We come here to the sixth verse in the fourth chapter.
[time=2229] Paul says to Timothy in pointing out these things to the brethren he had just gotten
[time=2235] done encouraging Timothy to speak the truth.
[time=2239] In pointing out these things to the brethren, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus,
[time=2245] constantly nourished on the words of faith and of the sound doctrine which you have been
[time=2251] following.
[time=2254] Did you see where I'm going there with that verse?
[time=2259] In pointing out these things, you will be exposed as a servant of who?
[time=2266] Say it.
[time=2268] Christ Jesus.
[time=2271] Now here's how this works, now this is real.
[time=2275] Here we'll just jump into real honesty, okay?
[time=2279] Hope this is all right.
[time=2281] I figured we should just shoot straight though and hopefully everybody learns from it, gets encouraged, gets reminded.
[time=2287] I know in my heart that I am to be a servant as a pastor, I know in my heart that I am
[time=2295] to be a servant of the Lord.
[time=2299] And yet there is this desire in me to make people happy, there's this desire in me to
[time=2305] please people.
[time=2307] And while that's kind of a character weakness in me, you also have to understand it comes
[time=2313] with the territory because here's why.
[time=2315] The way we're set up, and it's the way we're set up, and I don't know that it'll ever
[time=2322] change in my lifetime.
[time=2323] I'm not sure it's interesting, here we are talking about a book that gives clarity on the church, and there's not a lot of clarity on how this part was really set up.
[time=2332] We can talk about that later, but here's how it's set up.
[time=2335] This is my livelihood.
[time=2339] This is what God has called me to do, and then this is also how I support my family.
[time=2345] And I love what I get to do, I really do.
[time=2347] And I am so thankful that you allow me the chance to do it, but elders and pastors see
[time=2353] they meet and they pray and they do their best to keep their arms around a family, and as they keep their arms around a family, decisions get made.
[time=2361] And direction gets established, and hopefully that's done prayerfully, and hopefully that's
[time=2367] done with pure hearts and good intentions, and direction gets set, and decisions get made.
[time=2373] And sometimes guys like me stand and preach and teach things that are difficult for people to hear.
[time=2378] All kinds of stuff happens.
[time=2379] I make mistakes, or somebody else makes a mistake in another ministry, but it kind of all comes back to this idea of somebody then gets upset.
[time=2389] And if somebody gets upset enough, they leave, they write a nasty email, they spread divisive
[time=2398] speech, and it just gets ugly.
[time=2402] It gets difficult.
[time=2403] It gets destructive.
[time=2405] And when you're in this position long enough, and you've dealt with and seen enough destruction,
[time=2412] you've gotten enough emails, you've had enough hallway conversations, you've been told this
[time=2418] or that so many times when you see people who once were by your side gone, and then they
[time=2427] also leave with their checkbook, see how this starts to get really weird.
[time=2433] It's like you don't even want to say it, but then all of a sudden you feel threatened.
[time=2439] You think, "Oh my goodness, I want to support my family," and you think, "Oh gosh, you shouldn't say that.
[time=2444] Your face should be bigger than that." And it should, I'm just being honest.
[time=2450] There's destruction, there's division, there's attitudes, there's emails, there's harsh words,
[time=2458] there's stuff coming home to your kids, and then there comes a day when you sometimes just begin to say to yourself, "You know what?
[time=2468] I think I'm going to just keep my mouth shut.
[time=2472] I think I'm going to just try to somehow figure out a way to do this." And when you start doing that, then I start serving you.
[time=2484] And when I start serving you, when elders start serving you, instead of serving Christ
[time=2490] Jesus, wow, we're in trouble.
[time=2496] Do you understand that?
[time=2498] I'm not putting anything on you.
[time=2500] I'm just saying that's how that works sometimes, and it gets very difficult and challenging for a young pastor or an older pastor.
[time=2507] Sometimes in the midst of that, just reminding himself again and again, "Who am I trying
[time=2513] to please?
[time=2514] Who am I serving?
[time=2516] Who do I answer to?" And it doesn't mean I should conduct myself with you flippantly.
[time=2521] It doesn't mean that I should care less about your feelings or your heart, and it also means
[time=2529] you're going to have to help us and work with us in a way that's respectful of the design
[time=2536] that God has established.
[time=2538] Make sense?
[time=2540] Second Timothy 2, 4, I was just there a little bit ago.
[time=2543] I didn't finish reading what it said, then they come back and finish reading that.
[time=2548] Take Timothy 2, 4, it says, "No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs
[time=2555] of everyday life so that he may please the one who what enlisted him as a soldier."
[time=2565] And that is just a great reminder to me.
[time=2567] I can tell you the day, I can take you to the place.
[time=2573] I was just there recently.
[time=2575] I could take you to the pew in the church, in the city.
[time=2579] I could take you right to the place where he enlisted me.
[time=2585] And I know it was him, and I know it wasn't you.
[time=2590] And I need to be reminded of the fact that he is my king and he is whom I serve, and
[time=2596] I want to do that faithfully and I want to do that also in a way that encourages you.
[time=2602] Sometimes it's difficult.
[time=2603] All says, "Hang on, fight the good fight." Sometimes you realize your immaturity hurts the process.
[time=2609] He says, "We've got to work on that.
[time=2611] You've got to grow.
[time=2612] Don't let them look down on your youthfulness.
[time=2614] Remember who you're trying to please the Lord Jesus Christ, and forcefully write this down.
[time=2619] Remember, remember, oh, this is big, remember what's at stake.
[time=2624] Timothy, remember what's at stake.
[time=2627] Take with me, church, to chapter 4, back to 1 Timothy, chapter 4 verse 16.
[time=2635] Chapter 4 verse 16 and 15, he says, "Take pains with these things.
[time=2641] Be absorbed in them so that your progress, Timothy, will be evident to all."
[time=2648] Here you go.
[time=2649] "Pay close attention to yourself," he says, "Timothy, pay close attention to your character.
[time=2656] Pay close attention to your life.
[time=2662] Pay close attention to yourself," first part of 16, "and to your teaching.
[time=2668] Persevere in these things.
[time=2670] For as you do this, as you watch over yourself and your own godliness, and as you watch over
[time=2676] your teaching of the truth, you will ensure salvation, both for yourself and for those
[time=2685] who hear you.
[time=2688] You will ensure salvation, both for yourself and for those who hear you."
[time=2695] Interesting, interesting line there, isn't it?
[time=2699] Almost sounds like Timothy's responsible for ensuring salvation.
[time=2704] No, no, listen, I'll read this to you from the note here in my own Bible, "By careful
[time=2711] attention to his own godly life and the faithful preaching of the word, Timothy would continue
[time=2718] to be the human instrument God used to bring the gospel and to save some who heard him.
[time=2727] Though salvation is God's work," amen, "though salvation is God's work, it is his pleasure
[time=2733] to do it through human instruments." So what Paul saying here to Timothy, what I'm reminded of as I read this, what our leaders
[time=2743] need to see and understand is that salvation, eternity really, is on the line, is in view
[time=2754] here as we do ministry.
[time=2758] And I'm thankful that for the most part, I keep remembering this.
[time=2765] And what an amazing thought to have sitting in a restaurant booth, sitting in my office
[time=2771] with a family standing here with you week after week, that literally as we do this and as we try and do it faithfully, God works through these efforts to redeem and save and
[time=2783] transform people.
[time=2785] Do you understand how cool this is?
[time=2789] That we get to be a part of this.
[time=2790] There is so much at stake.
[time=2794] Paul says, "Take care of yourself and take care of your teaching, work hard, be faithful."
[time=2803] Remember what's at stake.
[time=2804] Well enough about me for the morning, there are some equally powerful reminders for you
[time=2810] as well.
[time=2812] Truths here in 1 Timothy that God may use in the days to come as we study this together to challenge you, to encourage you, to inspire you as part of the body of Christ here at
[time=2823] Blackhawk.
[time=2824] Here's just a couple.
[time=2825] Some reminders from 1 Timothy to you, to the church.
[time=2830] Here's one that's clearly on you, it's also clearly on us as leaders, but you certainly
[time=2836] share in this and I'll give it to you in the form of a question.
[time=2840] What should all of your learning produce in you?
[time=2847] I want you to think about that before I give you the answer.
[time=2851] What should all of your learning, a lot of learning goes on in church, or at least we would hope that you would be learning.
[time=2857] I hope you're learning in your small group.
[time=2858] I hope you're learning in your A.B.F.
[time=2860] I hope as we teach the Word of God here on Sunday mornings that you're learning, what should all of your learning, or we could say, "What should all of our teaching be producing?"
[time=2870] I want you to look with me at Paul's words to Timothy and the church.
[time=2876] In 1 Timothy 1.5, we'll actually get to this next week as we jump into the text.
[time=2881] But the goal of our instruction is what?
[time=2885] Say it, church.
[time=2886] Love.
[time=2887] See, sometimes we think the goal of our instruction is knowledge.
[time=2891] Sometimes you would answer that.
[time=2892] The goal of my learning is to know stuff, is to be smarter.
[time=2897] Sometimes we think the goal of our instruction has to do with our minds when what Paul seems
[time=2903] to indicate here is that it has maybe a lot to do with your heart.
[time=2907] Your heart is what needs to be changing.
[time=2910] Your love, your love for Him, your love for each other, your love for your family, your love for your co-worker, your love for the stranger, your love, you name it.
[time=2922] Somebody said, "If you're not more loving, you're not really learning." I hope you'll write that down.
[time=2926] I think it's true.
[time=2927] If you're not more, according to 1 Timothy 1.5, if you're not more loving, you're not really learning.
[time=2934] If our teaching is only aimed at transfer of Bible knowledge, then we have failed as teachers.
[time=2941] Important for you to understand this church, important for us to consider this, and we will again, even next week, 1 Timothy 1.5.
[time=2949] Here's another one for you.
[time=2950] Guess what the first two issues are that Paul addresses when he gets to what the gathering
[time=2957] is to look like?
[time=2958] Here's this section in chapter 2 where he begins to talk about what this is to look like when
[time=2964] we do this.
[time=2966] And while clearly there's things in his writing here aimed at those who lead, I just think
[time=2972] it's interesting.
[time=2974] First two things that he addresses, of all the things he could address that get talked
[time=2980] about and get wrestled with when it comes to how we do this.
[time=2986] First two things, number one, prayer for those who need Christ.
[time=2991] Very first thing Paul addresses with Timothy is he gets to this section of the book, chapter
[time=2997] 2, is prayer for those who need Christ.
[time=3001] Look with me at chapter 2, verse 1.
[time=3003] First of all, then I urge he begs them that in treaties, heartfelt prayers and prayers
[time=3011] and petitions and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men for kings and all who are
[time=3019] in authority so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life and all godliness and dignity.
[time=3025] This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=3033] Paul wants us, Paul wanted Timothy and those in the church there at Ephesus to be praying for those who were in authority.
[time=3041] He wanted them to be praying when they gathered for all men.
[time=3044] He wanted them to be praying that they would come to faith in the Son of God our Savior.
[time=3050] Therefore, verse 8, I want the men in every place to pray.
[time=3057] I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up, holy what, hands.
[time=3063] Just a reminder there folks, lifting up hands is not a Pentecostal thing.
[time=3069] It didn't start with the assemblies of God, it's not a charismatic deal, lifting up hands
[time=3075] is a Bible deal.
[time=3077] Paul said to have men lifting up holy hands without wrath and dissension were to do this
[time=3083] in unity.
[time=3086] You are to pray for Democrats and Republicans.
[time=3091] You were to pray for mayors and councilmen.
[time=3094] You were to pray for grouchy bosses.
[time=3097] You were to pray for all men that they would come to faith in Christ.
[time=3101] I would say we don't do enough of this.
[time=3104] We may do it privately.
[time=3106] I know many times I'm praying along those lines, but I want to see if we can't work on doing that as a family more often and more consistently.
[time=3116] First thing that gets addressed when Paul deals with the gathering is praying for those who need Christ.
[time=3123] One thing that gets addressed is the importance of modesty for women.
[time=3127] That's right.
[time=3128] There seemed to be a problem.
[time=3131] A problem is getting addressed here and it's right at the top of his list.
[time=3135] The second thing he looks at is the issue of modesty for women.
[time=3140] Look at 1 Timothy chapter 2 verse 9, he just keeps going likewise.
[time=3145] As I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with
[time=3156] braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments, but rather by means of good works.
[time=3162] Go back to nine, first part of nine, likewise, I want women to adorn themselves.
[time=3168] Do you understand this, ladies?
[time=3170] Let me just try and say it clearly.
[time=3172] You have been made by God.
[time=3174] God made you as a woman in his image.
[time=3178] He made you to be beautiful.
[time=3182] There was clearly with Eve at the beginning the sense that she was different than Adam and the response from Adam was, "Whoa." Remember?
[time=3192] I'm quoting.
[time=3193] He said, "Whoa, you're beautiful.
[time=3200] You have been made by God to be beautiful." And here's the deal.
[time=3205] And so as you adorn that, as you give attention to your unique God-given beauty, you are to
[time=3214] adorn that almost in a sense bring attention to it, not by what you wear, not by what you
[time=3223] look like, not by how you do your hair, not by a way in which attention would be drawn
[time=3230] to your uniqueness.
[time=3234] How was that?
[time=3238] You're to adorn yourself, you're to show your beauty by your good works, by your character.
[time=3246] First Peter 3 says, "By your gentle and quiet spirit, by your heart, this shows your beauty."
[time=3258] And have the unique capacity to be a distraction.
[time=3266] They have a unique capacity to be a distraction away from godliness and toward lust.
[time=3278] And so you think, and I think sometimes this is like a modern culture deal, no, no, no,
[time=3284] they were having problems with this and Paul says, "Hey gals, let's just revisit this."
[time=3291] And it's the second thing he gets to as he comes to this issue.
[time=3294] I think it's really important, so thankful, so thankful for so many of you women that
[time=3301] clearly go to great lengths to allow the focus to be him and the focus to be this privilege
[time=3310] we get of being together and not you, and it's just a great encouragement and reminder
[time=3316] for those who lead and for the body as well.
[time=3319] One more thing, I don't think this will be on your screen, but here's one for the body, here's one for the family, I think this is interesting.
[time=3326] Those who literally lead and care for the church in the highest place of spiritual authority,
[time=3335] as we study 1 Timothy, we're going to talk about those who literally lead and care for the church, men and women, elders, deacons, deaconesses.
[time=3346] And on the elder front, especially at the highest place of spiritual authority, do you know that this whole process begins with self-disclosure?
[time=3356] It says in 3-1, "Men, when you aspire to this," I know we're to appoint you, but it starts
[time=3365] with you aspiring, desiring before God to be a part of leading and loving and helping oversee this family.
[time=3372] We'll get to that, we'll teach you about that, but there's a lot here in this book that comes on me and those who lead, there's a lot here though for you as well.
[time=3382] I'll let you go here this morning, lastly I want you to see this real quick, put them all up on the screen Katie, nothing in this book at all about music, interesting, huh?
[time=3391] How many churches have split, how many denominations have been started?
[time=3395] There isn't anything at all in this book about music, what day or night of the week to meet.
[time=3401] Other than modesty for women, nothing about dress code or appearance, how many people have we run away from the church because they didn't look good enough?
[time=3410] Nothing on any age specific ministry, stage of life stuff.
[time=3414] I'm really grateful for children's, really thankful for student, really glad that we do stuff for those age specific settings.
[time=3422] The fact is here in this, you have this first Timothy, second Timothy Titus, this intersection going on all the time, this intersection of age and maturity, older and younger, together,
[time=3433] learning, mentoring, discipling, it's a great picture, we'll learn much more about it in the days to come, stand with me if you would, let me pray before we go.
[time=3443] Father in heaven, what a great encouragement today to just begin to think about what you'll
[time=3449] have for us as a church, as a body, in the days to come.
[time=3452] God, we desire, we truly do, we want to make disciples, we want to do what your son left
[time=3458] us here to do.
[time=3460] We want to see people come to faith in Christ and then we want to see them groan in their faith as followers of your son and God, you've chosen the church to be the instrument through
[time=3470] which this happens and oh God, we want it to happen well, please give us wisdom, encourage
[time=3476] in the days to come to faithfully, as leaders and as part of the flock, God, would we be
[time=3482] all that you've called us to be and could our church, could this family be all that you designed it to be in your son's name we pray Amen.
[time=3506] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
