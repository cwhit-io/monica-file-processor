[time=800] officially acclimated to Indiana you know that you're officially acclimated to Indiana
[time=807] you are a Hoosier now when you can stand like I did last night in my living room at 11 o'clock and I'm watching the TV there at all the church closings that are going along the bottom of
[time=819] the screen in 10 12 13 years ago if I were in that spot I would have looked at all the church closing and going oh my gosh what should I do how am I going to get there how are they going to get there would have been horrible 10 12 13 years ago last night I stood there and looked at it and just said wimps chickens and I'm so glad you made it and I want to
[time=844] say to those of you watching right now give me a camera where's the camera right there's a camera this is great now there are those in the Blackhawk family who are going to be watching this next Sunday morning and they didn't come today you're a chicken I want
[time=861] to say that to you shame on you if you're under 65 you have no excuse anyway it's good
[time=869] to be together and it's great to be able to jump in this morning to what I told you we would do last week we started with kind of an overview of the book of first Timothy and I want you to open there to first Timothy if you would and I promised you we would jump in this morning to the text and we will true church God's design for the body a study of
[time=891] Paul's letter to his good friend Timothy who is pastoring at the church in Ephesus he's
[time=897] facing all kinds of challenges he's up against all kinds of setbacks he is as a pastor in
[time=905] the ministry facing all kinds of persecution and push back and attitudes and people walking
[time=913] away from the faith and people not cooperating with this leadership it's a very difficult
[time=919] setting that Timothy finds himself in and so Paul writes to not only encourage Timothy but to remind the church of how it is God designed it to function and how it is God designed
[time=930] Timothy to function is one who leads so let's just jump in what do you say would you stand
[time=936] in honor of God's word and let me read this to you this morning first Timothy chapter one verses one through seven Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment
[time=947] of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus who is our hope I always stop when I read that
[time=954] first verse interesting we so many times separate the Trinity and we assign to God certain things
[time=964] that he does and we assign to Jesus certain things that he accomplishes it's interesting
[time=970] as you read according to the commandment of God our Savior oftentimes we think of the
[time=978] Lord Jesus as our Savior here God is our Savior because he is amen God our Savior and of Christ
[time=986] Jesus who is our hope to Timothy my true child in the faith grace mercy and peace from God
[time=996] the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord as I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia Timothy remain
[time=1003] on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines nor to pay
[time=1010] attention to myths and endless genealogies which give rise to mere speculation rather than
[time=1018] furthering the administration of God which is by faith but the goal of our instruction isn't
[time=1025] speculation as referenced in verse four the goal of our instruction Paul reminds Timothy is what
[time=1031] love love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith for some men straying from
[time=1040] these things have turned aside to fruitless discussion there's mere speculation again wanting to be
[time=1048] teachers of the law even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions our Father in heaven we stand as we often do
[time=1060] in this place thankful for the scriptures and expecting and hoping in our hearts God that you
[time=1068] would bring these words to be alive in our hearts and minds today God so many of us come to this
[time=1076] place this morning needing to hear a word from you God so many of us in the room this morning come
[time=1082] needing to be reminded and needing to be encouraged and needing to be convicted and some needing to be confronted and I pray now God that your Holy Spirit would not only anoint these words that I'm
[time=1096] about to speak but oh God that your Holy Spirit would rest on those in this room and open their
[time=1102] hearts and eyes and ears and souls to the truth that can set them free to the truth that can show
[time=1111] them a new path to the truth that maybe they've forgotten oh God would your Holy Spirit open the
[time=1117] eyes and hearts of those who've never heard it before may there be some today who will hear the
[time=1123] truth for the very first time and may you do great things and God may we make much of you in the
[time=1129] process and all the people in the room agreed and said amen you can be seated well as I read through
[time=1135] verses one to seven there I really want you to come back in your text this morning to this small
[time=1141] little phrase right there at the beginning of verse two you see it there it says to Timothy
[time=1148] my true child in the faith you see that my true child in the faith and I want to just as we start
[time=1159] this study and our time in first Timothy I want us to begin here this morning and I want to invite
[time=1165] you today to open your hearts and your minds to what God may have for you as we look at this
[time=1172] initial phrase my true child in the faith I want you to better understand what it means I want
[time=1180] you to better understand how it should I think by God's design find expression in your life I
[time=1187] want us to look at this together the phrase my true child in the faith the theme really of this
[time=1193] discussion in our study today spiritual parenthood you might want to write that down spiritual
[time=1199] parenthood my true child in the faith it is an emotional phrase it is a phrase that carries
[time=1209] with it deep emotion it is a phrase that lets you into the very heart and mind of Paul he loves
[time=1216] Timothy he values Timothy Timothy's life and Timothy's ministry mean a great deal to him Timothy you see
[time=1223] was his true child in the faith and the first idea I want you to consider
[time=1230] with me this morning about this phrase is that I believe it is pertinent to every single person
[time=1238] and it applies to every single person in this room those of you watching those of you listening
[time=1245] online if you've fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ if at some point you have pledged
[time=1252] your allegiance to him then this phrase is pertinent to and applies to you now there might be some
[time=1259] who might be thinking as we read this and talk about this but wait a minute Kelly this is the apostle Paul we're talking about here and this is Timothy he was a he was a pastor he was a leader
[time=1270] you may be thinking surely this true child in the faith is unique to those who are in ministry
[time=1277] or leadership but I want you to look at the text I want you to look at what it says does it say
[time=1283] my true child in the ministry does it say does it say that does it say my true child in leadership
[time=1294] no it says my true child in the what say it in the faith in the faith
[time=1300] yeah this phrase isn't about reproducing or spiritually parenting another leader
[time=1307] no true child in the faith is about reproducing or spiritually parenting another believer
[time=1314] it's not Paul speaking to a vocational professional endeavor no it's personal
[time=1321] and you can hear it in the way he says it it's just what he did with his faith he was a spiritual
[time=1330] father to another and in doing so and in writing about it here my friends he models for all of us
[time=1339] the priority of spiritual reproduction we all should have true children in the faith
[time=1350] and that's so important I'm going to say it to you again every one of you that names the name of
[time=1356] Christ I believe what we see here is a normative call to the idea that you and I should as believers
[time=1366] every one of us should have should be engaged in the process of having children in the faith
[time=1376] reproduction spiritual parenthood I wonder as I say these things I wonder if in your minds you can
[time=1383] even just for just a moment here think of those who spiritually mentored you who was it that
[time=1390] parented you in your faith who was it that walked with you who taught you how to walk who taught you
[time=1399] how to understand and better see the great truths of scripture who walked with you through those
[time=1405] formative years think of those who were so faithful to this in your own life maybe yet there are those in the room this morning and as you think about that your
[time=1416] mind draws tragically a blank maybe there haven't been those who have come alongside you in your
[time=1424] relationship with him maybe you sit here today in great need of someone to help you
[time=1432] understand what it means to eat the right stuff spiritually walk the right way
[time=1438] choose and make decisions and better understand the great truths of scripture in this God who loves
[time=1445] you deeply well I want you to look with me Paul had much to say about this topic I want you to flip
[time=1452] over to the second letter that he writes to Timothy would you do that go to second Timothy to two and here he actually lays out for us in somewhat specific terms the way in which he
[time=1464] wanted Timothy and I believe the way in which he wants you and I to approach spiritual reproduction
[time=1471] that's right he gets really clear and it gets really specific second Timothy to one I'm going to
[time=1477] actually start at second Timothy to one I want you to see the backdrop that he really kind of gives
[time=1483] in verse one that allows you to see the real power of verse two look with me at second Timothy to one
[time=1491] he says you therefore my son there's that phrase again second Timothy to one you therefore my son
[time=1500] be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus now I want you to stop there and I want to just
[time=1508] tell you real quickly that the backdrop to second Timothy is much like the backdrop to first Timothy
[time=1514] and here's what you got to understand he just said to him my dear son I want you to be strong
[time=1520] in the grace that is in Christ Jesus see Timothy was struggling you see the ministry wasn't going
[time=1527] well you see people were defecting critics were on the rise Timothy was experiencing great insecurity
[time=1536] and strife it was a very difficult calling it was a very difficult setting and so as you read through
[time=1544] first Timothy and as you read through second Timothy you get the clear sense that Paul is saying wait a minute dude hang on stand strong look at look at the look at one six second Timothy one
[time=1557] six for this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you for God
[time=1565] as verse seven for Timothy don't forget God has not given us a spirit of timidity but of what
[time=1571] say it power and love and discipline Paul's saying hang in there Paul saying I know it's tough he's
[time=1579] saying I realize ministry can be can be can be hard therefore look at verse eight therefore do not be
[time=1586] ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me but join with me in suffering Paul bolstering him
[time=1595] up Paul trying to re-envision him and having done that in two one be strong my son in the grace that
[time=1602] is in Christ Jesus now look what he says it's as if he encourages he admonishes he reminds and
[time=1609] now he gets to two two and he just jumps right in with the most practical thing you've ever seen
[time=1615] in the midst of difficulty Paul wants Timothy to remember God's design for the church the things
[time=1623] which you have heard from me Timothy in the presence of many witnesses I said these things to you
[time=1630] entrust these things Timothy to faithful men who will be able to teach others also it's really
[time=1641] really a powerful verse my friends Paul highlights here a spiritually reproductive mindset that reaches
[time=1649] into and eternally impacts for did you see it four generations of believers maybe you missed it you
[time=1658] can look on the screen we broke it down for you Paul generation one says the things what you have heard from me Timothy he passes those on he deposits the truth and the love of God into Timothy he
[time=1673] says these things entrust to faithful men there's generation number three faithful men who will be
[time=1679] held accountable to faithful men who will be asked to teach others also generation four this is how
[time=1689] Paul lived Paul had invested in Luke Paul had invested in Silas Paul had invested in Barnabas
[time=1698] and church I don't want you to miss this I want you to hear this Paul was very aware of the fact that the spread of the gospel lives being transformed and changed forever
[time=1711] the kingdom of God going forward not backward at a at a time my friends at a time when the
[time=1718] kingdom of God so desperately needed to go forward at a time when so much was at state when so much
[time=1726] is on the line as the new church is birthed and God's call to these men is so real and so pertinent
[time=1733] and Paul understood that in the midst of this crucial time that there was a way in which the
[time=1739] kingdom would go forward there was a way in which the church would be strengthened there was a way in which people would be reached it was absolutely dependent on this model of discipleship and
[time=1754] spiritual reproduction listen a spiritual relational investment being made one life at a time
[time=1766] one person you
[time=1772] you every person remember what I said it's pertinent and applicable to every person in this room
[time=1783] who has fully surrendered your heart and life to Jesus Christ you taking the time
[time=1793] you making the time making the sacrifice to invest truth wisdom love and encouragement
[time=1805] into the life of another with that person then being held accountable to pass the investment
[time=1811] along to others who will faithfully intentionally do the same with those in their world four generations
[time=1821] of discipleship right there the things you heard from me and trust of faithful men who will teach
[time=1829] others also I call it 4g Verizon has nothing on it I promise you
[time=1836] four generations that's exactly how Paul did it it's exactly how God designed it
[time=1843] and I wasn't thinking about it the four generation thing I wasn't thinking about it when I experienced
[time=1853] this that I'm about to tell you just a couple weeks ago but having experienced it blew me away
[time=1862] I had the chance to go back about a week and a half two weeks ago to southern California and there for just a couple of days had the privilege of getting to be with some dear friends good guys that have been a part of my life for years and periodically we'll get together and so during the couple of days back in southern California I had the additional privilege of
[time=1883] just spending a couple hours at the master's college which is where I graduated from there
[time=1889] Dr. John MacArthur's ministry Grace Community Church the master's college the master's seminary
[time=1895] many of you know my story I came to faith in 1983 there under Dr. John's ministry and the
[time=1902] master's college just played a huge role in my life and they made such an enormous investment in me
[time=1910] so I'll go back periodically and it's just a sweet thing to be able to see people many of the folks I knew then are still around and so there I was just a couple weeks ago
[time=1921] and something pretty incredible happened I was well I'll go back to my senior year in college
[time=1932] I'd just been saved maybe a year or two the most I was still still rapidly growing
[time=1939] he had a lot to do with me many he had a lot to do a lot of work to do in me many of you know my story in my senior year as I found myself in a position of leadership there in the dorms
[time=1950] I met a freshman boy young guy little edgy little avant garde little out there
[time=1957] didn't like the establishment didn't like the status quo had his hair a little too long you know
[time=1964] for the master's college liking listened to kind of the wrong music I think he had a genuine love
[time=1970] for god but just personality wise and approach he was just a little different and I could tell as we met that he really had a genuine desire to know god and maybe figure some things out and so
[time=1981] I just befriended him and we were quite the match there couldn't have been two guys more different
[time=1987] and yet god helped us forge a friendship and we began to meet on a regular basis
[time=1993] to disciple him and he encouraged me and we read the scriptures together and we prayed together
[time=1999] we began to walk through more and more of life together and what god did there was not only grow him spiritually encouraged me even more but he developed a huge bond and friendship that for years has been special I got a fast forward the story is pretty long so I'll fast forward to
[time=2016] the fact that that young man his name is mark freshman in the dorms back in 86 a little out there
[time=2025] grew and grew and grew I left southern california he stayed became involved actually on the leadership
[time=2032] side of things that the college working with students in the dorms and then working with students in student life and then actually leading student life there at the college and today is the president of the master's college isn't that crazy he's the president and john
[time=2054] macarthur still that I don't know what they call him maybe it's grandpuba king kahuna chancellor I don't know emeritus whatever but my buddy mark is the president of the college
[time=2066] so I'm back on campus that I'm sorry I have a little detour there now I'm on campus just a
[time=2072] couple weeks ago and there's me and mark we're under the oaks in this big area where all the students gather talking and just having a great time remembering old days and thanking god for all that he has done and up walks a young guy comes up to mark and I'm looking at him and I'm
[time=2088] thinking I know you his name's joe and joe used to be now rewind joe used to be in student life at
[time=2097] the college he was like an assistant to the intramural director I mean joe was like carrying
[time=2104] flag footballs around and setting up cones at games and helping out with chapel setup
[time=2110] and now I'm looking at joe and joe's dressing a lot nicer than he used to he's got a little gray in
[time=2117] the hair and I'm like joe what are you doing you said hey kelly how are it's good to see you
[time=2123] again I said well what are you doing he goes well actually I'm the and he kind of looks at mark and mark kind of looks at me and he says I'm actually the vice president now here at the college
[time=2133] and I'm there's a there's a side discussion here that I would just entitle how to feel really old
[time=2139] that that was also going on here he's the vice president in charge of student life and I'm like wow and mark kind of he's laughing and joe's kind of laughing
[time=2150] and they're laughing because it's amazing and they're also laughing because they know I'm feeling very old and then this I'm telling you then this kid this kid just walks up I mean to me it was
[time=2161] like a kid I'm like who are you were you like a freshman here and he nice young man he says no
[time=2167] pastor bird my name is any I can't remember his name but he kind of stands next to joe and joe kind of looks at mark and mark kind of looks at me and joe says to me kelly this is so
[time=2177] and so he's the dean of students and I we just laughed and had such a sweet time just right there
[time=2185] in that moment and it wasn't until I'm flying home reading first Timothy that it hits me
[time=2193] that there's this four generation picture and the kingdom of god going forward and gosh lives
[time=2201] changed and altered forever and hear how I say this with great humility and just you know me
[time=2209] I'm amazed God ever did anything with me but I just took an hour one day in a dorm with a little
[time=2217] bit of a weird freshman kid and I can't tell you what he's done with it and I wonder how many weird
[time=2225] freshman kids there are in your life wonder how many opportunities God will give you to just
[time=2233] invest your heart and life and what you know and what he's teaching you into the heart and life of somebody else now I've got to ask you another question and this one's really this is powerful my
[time=2243] friends this is one we got to hold on to you got to hold on to this one for a while it just hit me this week and I want you just to see this why why do you think that Paul is so passionate about this why do you think that with such clarity
[time=2263] and with such force Paul lays out for Timothy who's struggling in the ministry in the church
[time=2271] which has to survive why do you think Paul is so devoted to this process of four generational
[time=2281] discipleship watch this Paul who used to be who saw who used to not care about or be passionate
[time=2302] about the church thriving but who used to be passionate about killing it do you remember
[time=2310] Saul the great enemy of the church who tortured Christians who beat people who kidnapped
[time=2321] kids who tore families apart in his absolute utter hatred of what was right and his deep devotion
[time=2329] and commitment to squelch it so as Saul tries to squelch the church by killing and murdering and
[time=2340] torturing these early followers of Christ question for you how successful was he
[time=2347] was he successful yes or no did the church thrive anyway yes or no yeah
[time=2357] you see where I'm going who did Saul bump up against let me tell you who he bumped up against
[time=2364] I'll back up a little bit who did he bump up against don't think for a moment most of you don't but let me just
[time=2374] be clear don't think for a moment that the the things you heard from me in trust of faithful men
[time=2380] who will in turn teach others also don't think that started with Paul
[time=2387] it started with a guy named who who Jesus Jesus
[time=2395] entrusted to faithful men the gospel namely Peter James and John and there were nine others that
[time=2406] were in that game as well but Jesus discipled Jesus second Timothy two two these twelve who in turn
[time=2417] taught others also and that was so effective and it was so right and they were so faithful that
[time=2426] they in turn entrusted it to others who bumped into Saul and he tried to kill him to squelch the
[time=2437] movement and the movement didn't get squelched it was sustained and Saul who's now Paul looks back
[time=2445] and goes you know what that worked and Timothy if we want this thing to work we're going to do
[time=2455] this thing just like Jesus did it and this thing will sustain itself this thing will thrive this
[time=2462] thing will grow this thing will endure because with a foundation like this it can happen amen
[time=2470] it's a great thing to to see and be reminded of so if it's so great and it is isn't it if it's so powerful if it's so effective
[time=2486] if it brings such stability if it's what allows the church and those who are in it to go forward
[time=2495] and growth and maturity with lives being transformed and changed why are so many of you not doing it
[time=2503] then why are so many of you not spiritually reproducing yourselves
[time=2517] this isn't a you know a 10 minutes here where I'm going to take shots I'm not
[time=2524] here to make you feel guilty and I'm not disciplining you I just want to remind you
[time=2531] of how important it is I want you to see as I think you have how effective it is and I want to just get you thinking about maybe some things in your life like there are some things in mind that can get in the way of you and I engaging in this process of spiritual reproduction that Paul
[time=2549] so clearly lays out to a guy who was desperately in in need of the encouragement just like you
[time=2556] and me are here are some things I think to answer that question but I want you to write down and
[time=2564] think about this morning why are so many of us not spiritually reproducing ourselves number one some can claim ignorance there are some in the room this morning some of you watching the broadcast
[time=2575] and you just didn't know that this was normative and so you get a you you got a pass there for
[time=2582] about three minutes and now you know so now you're in with us now you understand that this is how
[time=2589] God designed it to work this is what God expects this isn't high and above and beyond this isn't
[time=2595] for the really really smart or gifted no this is every day normal common normative Christian living
[time=2604] you ought to be in the spiritual reproduction game a second reason why so many of you maybe aren't involved in the spiritual reproducing process
[time=2621] some are simply too consumed some are simply too consumed with personal producing if you will to
[time=2632] engage in spiritual reproducing what do I mean by this well what I mean by that is this sometimes
[time=2639] producing earnings sometimes producing a reputation sometimes producing more opportunities for fun
[time=2647] or leisure sometimes producing a bigger portfolio sometimes producing greater success sometimes this
[time=2655] is what defines us sometimes this is what we are consumed with sometimes this is the extent to which
[time=2662] any production is going on in your life and sometimes mine and so it really begs the question
[time=2671] what will characterize you my friend in the days to come short term temporal production or eternal
[time=2681] kingdom advancing spiritual reproduction some can claim ignorance some too consumed with producing
[time=2689] here's one to just chew on with me this morning truth be told some just don't have much to pass on
[time=2696] some of you in the room this morning some of you watching on the broadcast the truth is you just
[time=2704] don't have much to pass on the spiritual tank if you will you can just let me use the analogy of a
[time=2712] tank like a fuel tank the spiritual tank from which you would draw from to invest in another
[time=2718] is pretty empty and if that's you you you probably know what I mean your faith
[time=2730] for a number of reasons possibly hasn't developed in years somewhere along the way you stopped
[time=2737] growing and now what was once alive lays dormant maybe even on its way to death
[time=2745] how do you know if you're in this third category well ask yourself some questions
[time=2753] would you do that ask yourself some questions you can find out maybe if you're in this category
[time=2759] of those that maybe just don't have much to pass on here's one for you does this conversation
[time=2765] we're having right now bore you are you bored by this or are you intrigued
[time=2774] are you checked out got a little Aaron Rodgers on your mind a little buffet tonight in the big game
[time=2789] another question you might ask is how much time how much time in a given week do you spend on Facebook
[time=2796] how much time do you spend on the construction and developing of your physical body
[time=2803] how much time do you spend shopping I don't mean grocery we'll give you a pass for that how much time are you engaged in a hobby
[time=2819] compared to the time spent developing and growing your spiritual life
[time=2826] how devoted are you truly how many hours a week would you be willing to spend on spiritual formation
[time=2835] for your heart and for your mind and for your life just a great chance for you to do some
[time=2842] comparing there because I know you spend hours like I do doing other things
[time=2849] and sometimes it comes back to an issue of willful choice and priority and the help and
[time=2855] accountability and encouragement needed to maybe alter or adjust those choices
[time=2861] what serving ministry are you actively involved in what books or online articles
[time=2870] what supplemental studies are you feeding on to raise the level of spiritual awareness in your life
[time=2879] I wrote this one down when was that I was reminded of this phrase as I thought about
[time=2886] being five six years old and the pew listening to my dad preach and the churches that we were a part of I don't hear the phrase very often anymore but it's a really good phrase when was the last
[time=2898] time you when was the last time you led someone to the Lord I love that phrase I mean we know that
[time=2909] God brings people to himself amen but he allows you and I to be involved in the process doesn't he
[time=2917] when was the last time I mean in some ways this is all for not if you don't have somebody to invest
[time=2925] in when was the last time that you led someone
[time=2936] through your redemptive prayers and your gift of time and your building of a friendship and your
[time=2946] willingness to ask questions and have meaningful conversation when was the last time you got to
[time=2955] lead someone to faith in Christ which really is a question that begs another question kind of a
[time=2964] sub point to that one when you ask that question sometimes what gets revealed is a little bit
[time=2970] concerning as well because a lot of us in the room maybe would say it's been a while and you'd say
[time=2976] it's been a while since you led someone to Christ because you don't know anybody that needs him
[time=2983] like who do you know that really needs him who are you close with that you know really needs him
[time=2995] what have we done with our relational worlds and how much proximity is there in your life
[time=3002] in mind to those who don't know the Lord Jesus and who desperately need him these are
[time=3008] things to think about you know what else some think that back to our list here of why it doesn't
[time=3016] happen something spiritual parenting is whose job something spiritual parenting is my job
[time=3025] you do some of you think some of you are looking at me going dude just do it you be the spiritual parent you're the guy up there you're the guy with all the leadership you're the guy with all the abilities you you do it you spiritually parent we're just out here
[time=3041] and you're up there which is which is you know classic we talked about this before we got to
[time=3047] be careful with that mindset we really do because while God has called elders while God has called
[time=3053] leaders to teach this I mean we've we've had this discussion before we've we've talked about even how sometimes this room we've talked about how the way we gather
[time=3065] sometimes promotes that very thinking you you know I've told you before that if really
[time=3072] I could I could do it the way I'd want to do it what sometimes I wish I could just
[time=3079] how you doing bud sometimes I wish that we could just kind of do it like this somehow
[time=3085] because the Bible is really clear while it does specify that there are to be elders
[time=3091] who lead right amen the Bible is really clear that the ministry of the church it going forward
[time=3101] things getting done ministry happening is supposed to be you not me this is supposed to be we
[time=3111] not I and all that gets done and all that is accomplished is to be the the the product the fruit
[time=3120] of yes teaching that inspires and instructs and matures you all to go do second Timothy to to so
[time=3130] don't look at me people sitting right near me don't want to look at me either I know they're looking away we've never been this close hi Judy hi Roger but I know sometimes the way we do this
[time=3143] kind of makes that hard and I'm serious I told first hour this I just got going so I might as well tell you I'll try and make it quick I told first hour that in this just me I'm just talking okay
[time=3154] this is not some elder plan we've never talked about this I sometimes when I think about this room
[time=3161] if I were like a construction guy and I had a lot of money and I could just do it which I can't I would sometimes just like see where the slope starts right here I really I thought about this
[time=3172] I would take out all the pews sorry just just let me let me just talk for a second I take it all
[time=3178] the pews and right where it starts to slope I would make it even so that it just came you
[time=3184] architects are just getting all excited now so that it kind of just hit right in here so there's no slope down it's just even you with me so far I think sometimes all this sometimes it kind of
[time=3198] just the way it looks and the way it is kind of promotes this us and them sometimes all this looks
[time=3205] like dada you know I mean and I'm not making fun of it I love our church I love our family I love
[time=3213] the building God's giving us we we're doing okay but here's the deal if I could I'd flatten all this out I'd take rid I get all the pews out I would put chairs from right over there
[time=3226] oh this would no longer be the stage it's just where we sit I just put chairs all across here
[time=3234] and wrap them all the way to there and there'd be chairs over there and there'd be we'll leave the pews in the very very back it'd be chairs over here and it would all be focus it in right here
[time=3243] and I just have like a stool give Corbin a little junior you know lioness and Lucy piano we could put some band members you know around if we needed to the choir could be out in the
[time=3258] way you could be the what you could be the choir the choir could also be anyway sometimes I think
[time=3266] the way we even do the room I don't know how much all that would cost by the way but if anybody was taking notes while I explain that and you've come up with an itemized cost and you want to
[time=3277] write a check just go ahead and let me know about that but does that make sense see sometimes I
[time=3284] hate coming back up here because I just like being with you and sometimes we have to remember
[time=3290] this isn't up to us this isn't up to me it's up to we some avoid the challenge
[time=3298] of spiritual parenting some avoid the challenge lastly of spiritual parenting because
[time=3305] parenting is what say it parents any parents in the room
[time=3311] it never gets it never gets what this is not easy and spiritual parenting is much like physical
[time=3321] literal parenting it's never over it's never easy there's always challenges listen listen
[time=3328] it's so it's so nice for me to be able to stand here and tell you this morning about my friend Mark
[time=3336] I'm so proud of him and I'm so thankful I mean he's just the impact he's having in
[time=3345] Joe and the guy whose name I can't remember it just it brings tears to my eyes it just really
[time=3352] encourages me you know what over all my years there's a whole bunch that didn't turn out so well
[time=3361] I think really sad stories of choices made and decisions made that just shipwrecked them
[time=3375] and it's hard when you get in close it's hard when you really live life together it's hard to
[time=3382] walk that closely so a lot of times we just say no thanks let him do it I'm too busy with Facebook
[time=3390] no thanks let someone else do it I'm too busy with whatever think through that list of questions my friends again not meant to discourage you not meant to
[time=3403] demean you just meant to get you to honestly think about God's design from moving
[time=3409] the church forward with strength and sustainability and maybe give you a chance to think about your
[time=3415] part in that and why sometimes maybe it doesn't happen the way God designed it to and I hope it's been an encouragement to you I'll say this and then we're going to go the only way you'll ever jump into this is to get connected the only way you'll ever be able to do this is to know people and
[time=3431] the only way you'll know people is to join a small group to become a part of a Sunday morning community the only way you'll ever be able to do this is to be in an ABF to come and talk to us
[time=3442] to engage us and say I'd love to be able to be discipled I'd love to be able to share with someone
[time=3449] else the things I've learned you're going to have to speak up you're going to have to come forward you're going to have to connect amen so Father in heaven we leave grateful for what we've learned
[time=3461] this morning from your word oh God allow us to move beyond ourselves and to the lives of others
[time=3467] to humbly and lovingly and patiently reproduce your work in them God I pray as we give this morning
[time=3474] that real needs for real people would be met we will let our words be few in the days to come we
[time=3483] will stand in awe of you we love you in your son's name we pray amen God bless you
[time=3513] you
