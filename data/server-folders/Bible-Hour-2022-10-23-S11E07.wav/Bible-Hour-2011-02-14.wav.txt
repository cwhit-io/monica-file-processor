[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Hey everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=33] It's great to have you with us today.
[time=34] And I welcome you back to our study of first Timothy.
[time=39] Paul writes to Timothy in order to help them understand how the church was to function.
[time=45] He writes to Timothy as a pastor and leader, giving him some real clear direction on how he is to lead and love the church.
[time=52] He also writes to the church itself, to you, the body of Christ, helping the church understand how they are to function in a way that will allow the church to be all that God intended it to be.
[time=64] This morning, it's very important as you watch, and I hope you will, and I hope you'll listen.
[time=70] It's very important today that you ask yourself, as we get into today's message, that you ask yourself, what is it that I believe?
[time=79] You see, I want you to listen today because we're gonna talk about the truth, the absolute truth of the gospel.
[time=88] Paul wants Timothy to make sure that no other gospels are being preached.
[time=94] He wants Timothy to make sure that there isn't any strange doctrine being communicated because you see, God has for his people this huge desire that they would know the truth.
[time=107] And the gospel, my friends, this good news of salvation, it's so important that you understand it, and it's so important that you've put your faith into a true and living gospel.
[time=120] There are a lot of gospels out there today.
[time=123] There really are, there are a lot of trains of thought, a lot of philosophies, there's a lot of teaching out there that invites you to put your faith in it.
[time=133] And I just want you to understand today, it's a very serious matter.
[time=137] Your eternity may be at stake, and I want you, we want you to understand the one true gospel that God has provided for you that allows you the privilege of having sin forgiven, the privilege of having a relationship with God.
[time=154] It's a gospel that gives you the privilege of an eternity that is sure.
[time=159] And so this morning as you watch, open your hearts, open your eyes and ears and ask yourself, what do I believe?
[time=166] What have I put my faith in?
[time=168] And does the answer to that question match up with what you're gonna hear today?
[time=173] It's so good to have you with us.
[time=175] We're so thankful for the truth that we get to proclaim.
[time=178] We wanna do it in a loving and inviting way.
[time=181] And yet this morning, I hope that you'll really, truly understand there is so much at stake when it comes to what you believe.
[time=187] So I hope you'll be encouraged.
[time=189] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=190] Thanks so much for being a part of our family.
[time=193] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=195] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 9 seconds]
[time=212] - Oh, the depths of the riches
[time=221] and the wisdom and knowledge of God.
[time=223] How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways.
[time=229] For who he's known the mind of the Lord or who has been his counselor.
[time=234] Or who was given a gift to him that he might be repaid.
[time=238] And from him and through him and to him or all things,
[time=244] to him, to God, be glory forever.
[time=247] [AMEN] (upbeat music) Do you sing this with me?
[time=255] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 586 seconds]
[time=849] (audience applauding) [AMEN] We praise you this morning, God.
[time=857] We sing these songs to you for your great name and for the great things that you have done and everyone who agreed said amen.
[time=865] Thanks for singing with us, you may be seated.
[time=868] That song stresses the things that God has done.
[time=879] Imagine if you could, this morning, compiling a list of absolutely everything God's done in your life.
[time=887] It's almost inexhaustible if you think about your own life.
[time=892] Now add on every person's list in this room of all the things that God has done.
[time=898] And tack on it to that list, everything that God's done for every person in this world, for every believer in this world, for every person that's ever lived in all of time, and it's just unfathomable, the things that God has done.
[time=915] And even though God manifests Himself and does different things in different ways for different people at different times in different places, the Scripture constantly points us to the good things that God has done that are more universal.
[time=929] And in particular, the thing I want to emphasize today is the thing that God's done for people who put their hope and their trust in Jesus.
[time=937] Jesus promised that His followers, in John chapter 14, to be specific, He promised that they would receive a comforter or a Holy Spirit who would descend on them and dwell in them and empower them to do incredible things for God.
[time=954] And it wasn't just something that was going to happen to those believers a couple thousand years ago, but any person from that point on that comes to know Jesus as the Lord receives this gift of the Holy Spirit.
[time=967] The problem is sometimes the Holy Spirit is a little mysterious, and we can't quite figure out all the ways that He's working and moving, and I think God likes it that way because it requires lots of faith.
[time=981] In this morning, I'm going to read to you from a book called "Forgotten God." Francis Chan wrote this book, it's subtitled "Reversing our Tragic Neglect of the Holy Spirit." And in the book, he just says that a lot of times we forget about this part of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, because it's mysterious and we don't have it all figured out.
[time=1002] In an attempt to not tragically neglect Him today, I thought I'd just read a few points from this book about who the Holy Spirit is.
[time=1012] Each one of them is taken right out of the pages of Scripture, so really I'm pointing you to the Word of God.
[time=1017] But just listen to some of the things that God promises us in the Holy Spirit.
[time=1024] In the Gospels, Jesus said that the Spirit would help His disciples speak when they're in precarious situations and they need to bear witness.
[time=1034] When they were being persecuted, you said, "Don't worry about what to say, the Holy Spirit will tell you what to say." In John 14 that I just mentioned earlier, Jesus calls him the counselor, and the counselor does these things.
[time=1046] He teaches and reminds us of what we need to know and remember.
[time=1051] What a huge gift.
[time=1053] Acts 1 tells us that it's from the Holy Spirit that we receive the power that we need to be God's witnesses to the ends of the earth.
[time=1062] We can't even evangelize or tell people about Jesus without the power of the Holy Spirit in us.
[time=1069] Romans 8 says a lot about the Holy Spirit.
[time=1072] By the power of the Spirit, we put to death the misdeeds of the body.
[time=1076] The Spirit sets us free from the sins we can't get rid of in our own strength.
[time=1083] Thankful for the Holy Spirit.
[time=1086] Through the Spirit, also in Romans 8, we receive a spirit of adoption as children, which leads us into intimacy with the Father.
[time=1096] John 16 says that the Holy Spirit convicts people of sin.
[time=1100] And I love this part.
[time=1101] The Holy Spirit doesn't just do that before we enter into a relationship with God, but the Holy Spirit convicts us of sin as we journey through this life as believers.
[time=1111] The Spirit also brings us life in freedom.
[time=1114] By the power of the Holy Spirit, Romans 15 says we abound with hope because our God is a God of hope, and he fills his children with the Holy Spirit who helps them hope.
[time=1126] 1 Corinthians 12 reminds us of the way that the Holy Spirit uniquely gifts each person in God's kingdom to have a manifestation of the Spirit or spiritual gifts so that we can be a benefit to one another as we journey this life together.
[time=1141] And Galatians 5 says that the fruit of the Spirit of God should lead us.
[time=1147] That the Spirit should lead us, and then we will have manifested in us.
[time=1150] These fruits love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[time=1161] Ultimately, in order for all of these things to happen in us, as believers, we need to humble ourselves into a posture of submission where we're denying our flesh that wages war in our hearts and allowing the Spirit to reign.
[time=1177] Romans 8 talks about that battle.
[time=1179] Romans 7 also.
[time=1182] And so this morning, I've asked Jonathan to sing a song for you that I think is a beautiful song of submission and a beautiful song of surrender.
[time=1189] So the ways of the Holy Spirit in our hearts, and as he sings, I encourage you to make it your prayer this morning.
[time=1197] Long after the tears fall,
[time=1217] I'm still your child.
[time=1221] Put down my defenses, lay down my pride.
[time=1228] Love and forgiveness flow in deep and wide, so I'll run to you.
[time=1237] And surrender all as I lay down my life and pick up my cross.
[time=1249] What a joy it is to give my life away to you.
[time=1255] All that I need, all that I seek is you here with me.
[time=1265] Holy Spirit, have your way in we.
[time=1277] In times of trouble, those trials may come.
[time=1283] The rock of angels is standing strong.
[time=1290] I'm fighting battles, but the war is won, so I'll run to you.
[time=1299] And surrender all as I lay down my life and pick up my cross.
[time=1311] What a joy it is to give my life away to you.
[time=1318] All that I need, all that I seek is you here with me.
[time=1327] Holy Spirit, have your way in me.
[time=1336] More of you
[time=1342] and less of me God, more of you and less of me God, more of you and less of me God, more of you overflow as I lay down my life and pick up my cross.
[time=1377] What a joy it is to give my life away to you.
[time=1384] All that I need, all that I seek is you here with me.
[time=1393] Holy Spirit, have your way in me.
[time=1400] Yeah, yeah.
[time=1403] Holy Spirit, have your way in me.
[time=1414] ♪
[time=1424] I want to welcome you back this morning to our study of 1 Timothy.
[time=1428] We've entitled the series.
[time=1430] As you can see on the screen, True Church, God's design for the body.
[time=1434] God's design for the body of Christ.
[time=1437] We come to this letter that the Apostle Paul writes to his good friend and dear child in the faith.
[time=1444] Timothy is pastoring the church at Ephesus.
[time=1447] It's a challenge.
[time=1449] There are things he is facing that are discouraging for him.
[time=1454] Paul writes with a heavy heart and yet writes to inspire and encourage Timothy to keep in mind the things that God has called him to.
[time=1462] I want you to see just real quickly, a picture on the screen.
[time=1466] A good friend of mine, Bill.
[time=1467] Culp gave this to me last week.
[time=1469] Bill's actually been inside this room.
[time=1471] This is the prison room in Rome where Paul wrote 1 Timothy.
[time=1478] This is the room.
[time=1479] This is the actual place where Paul wrote to Timothy and Titus.
[time=1487] This is where he was jailed and imprisoned.
[time=1490] It's a real place.
[time=1492] Sometimes it's just good to see these things.
[time=1494] It's a real place.
[time=1495] It was a real guy.
[time=1496] It wrote a real letter.
[time=1497] And we get to read it today.
[time=1499] You see the wood burning contraption over on the side.
[time=1502] The hole in the ground is what you would imagine a hole in the ground for.
[time=1508] You see the desk.
[time=1510] I think the lights were added later.
[time=1513] And I'm not sure if that's a picture of a grandma on the top of the table or what, but there's something back in there that probably got added later.
[time=1519] But anyway, there it is.
[time=1520] There is the place where Paul wrote the letter that we read today.
[time=1525] Pretty amazing, huh?
[time=1527] Paul had some things on his heart.
[time=1531] There were some things that were of great concern to Paul as he writes this letter.
[time=1537] As we begin here in chapter one, you'll quickly see what one of them is.
[time=1541] And let me just set it up with you this morning by saying it this way to you.
[time=1546] If I could take the time, we would be here for a long time if I took the time to tell you story after story after story that I could tell you.
[time=1555] Of individuals who I know.
[time=1558] People who were friends of mine, people who I started in ministry with.
[time=1564] I could stand here for a very long time and tell you story after story after story of individuals who at some point along the way began to wander, began to stray from, began to be entertained by other, by other messages, other than the message of this book.
[time=1589] I could tell you story after story of churches that I'm aware of who started at one point in time so very committed to and devoted to proclaiming and representing the truth of God's Word.
[time=1602] And I could tell you story after story of churches that have wandered and strayed from the clear teaching of God's Word.
[time=1610] And whether it was an individual I could tell you about or a church I could tell you about.
[time=1614] The end is always the same.
[time=1616] It's over the cliff.
[time=1618] It's down on the rocks.
[time=1620] It's just strewn out all over the place.
[time=1622] It's sad and horrific and heartbreaking.
[time=1626] Because that's what happens when people.
[time=1629] It's what happens when churches move away from the teaching that God gave us in His Word.
[time=1638] 1 Timothy 1 verses 1 to 7.
[time=1642] First things first.
[time=1643] Pay attention to your teaching.
[time=1646] Paul knew what Timothy was up against.
[time=1649] Paul knew that a different message, a different gospel, had already started to make its way into the Ephesian church.
[time=1658] And so he lovingly and forcefully exhorts Timothy to do two things.
[time=1663] And I want you to see these two things this morning.
[time=1666] I want you to walk away this morning with these two things clearly in mind.
[time=1669] The two things that Paul encourages, the two things that Paul exhorts Timothy to do.
[time=1676] And I want you, if you would, to just in honor of God's Word, would you stand?
[time=1680] And let me read this to you this morning.
[time=1682] Listen for these two things as I read.
[time=1684] 1 Timothy 1 verses 1 to 7.
[time=1689] Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, according to the commandment of God, our Savior and of Christ Jesus, who is our hope.
[time=1696] 2 Timothy, my true child in the faith, grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
[time=1706] As I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia, Timothy, Paul here writing directly to Timothy, remain on at Ephesus, so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines, but to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration of God, which is by faith.
[time=1734] But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
[time=1742] For some men straying from these things have turned aside to fruitless discussion, wanting to be teachers of the law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions.
[time=1757] Our Father in heaven, since even as we read these words, that Paul's heart is heavy for his friend who leads, that Paul's heart is heavy for those whom his friend and child in the faith leads.
[time=1775] God, we understand this book to be a book that whether we lead the church or whether we're part of the church, God, there are things that you have designed, there are commandments that you have set forth, there is a way of doing this God that works, and there is a way that doesn't.
[time=1794] And so Father, we pray this morning that our hearts and minds would be open to the truth that you would have for those of us who lead and for those of us who follow.
[time=1803] May this time be fruitful.
[time=1805] May it be pleasing to you in your Son's name.
[time=1807] We pray. Amen.
[time=1810] Amen. Two things.
[time=1812] Very important that every church leader should keep as a priority two things that every church member should be ready to support that leader in as well.
[time=1823] And you see those two things right there in verse three.
[time=1827] Just bring your attention back to verse three here in our text.
[time=1831] You see it there.
[time=1832] "Remain on," he says to Timothy, "remain on at Ephesus so that you may," what?
[time=1838] Say it, "instruct." "Remain on and instruct." These are the two things I want you to keep in mind.
[time=1846] This morning these are the two truths that will do our best to unpack here in the time that God has allowed.
[time=1852] Let's start with Paul's exhortation and his encouragement to Timothy to remain on.
[time=1858] Will you write that down?
[time=1860] "Remain on." If you translated that in the Greek, it would pretty much just say, "Stay." And I want you to think about what's implied.
[time=1871] If Paul's saying to Timothy, "Stay." "Remain on." What's implied there is what?
[time=1879] It's almost like telling a dog.
[time=1881] Whoa, stay.
[time=1882] Stay.
[time=1883] You know?
[time=1884] Stay.
[time=1885] You got to tell the dog to stay because the dog wants to what?
[time=1888] Go.
[time=1889] Yeah, when you study this in the original language, there's really some great force with this word.
[time=1894] It's like he's begging him.
[time=1895] He's like telling him.
[time=1896] He's exhorting him.
[time=1897] He's admonishing him.
[time=1898] Remain on.
[time=1900] 'Cause I know you want to go.
[time=1903] I know it's tough.
[time=1905] We discussed this at length two weeks ago, so we won't belabor the point much this morning.
[time=1910] Ministry, leading and loving a church full of people who are fallen, broke and sinful, can be a very lonely and difficult task.
[time=1920] I think it goes without say to mention that following a leader, or leaders who are fallen, broken and sinful, can be a very difficult task as well.
[time=1933] We all understand the challenge that goes on in the body of Christ.
[time=1939] Paul knew and was very aware of this challenge.
[time=1943] Paul knew how difficult ministry can be.
[time=1945] Paul knew how painful it could be to do what he was calling and reminding Timothy to do.
[time=1953] Paul knew how hard it was.
[time=1955] Paul knew the price that got paid when one stood for and proclaimed the truth.
[time=1962] Sometimes people read Paul as he speaks to Timothy and they think, "Man, he's kind of hard on that guy.
[time=1968] He's telling him not to be ashamed.
[time=1971] He's telling him to be bold.
[time=1972] He's telling him to preach the word in season and out, in season and out, meaning when it's joyful and blissful and fun, and even when it's painful, dark and discouraging." Here's Paul telling Timothy again and again and again.
[time=1986] Stay at this.
[time=1989] I think it's important for you all to be reminded today that Paul knew what it was like.
[time=1995] He exhorts and he admonishes out of his own experience.
[time=1999] We could go to many of those.
[time=2000] Why don't you hear those pages turning?
[time=2002] Go to the book of Acts.
[time=2005] Go if you would to Acts, chapter 14.
[time=2007] Let me just read this for you quick.
[time=2008] I want you to understand the heart from which and the experience from which Paul admonishes and encourages Timothy to remain on.
[time=2017] It says in Acts 14, it's quite a story.
[time=2020] We won't get into all the backdrop of it, but the people have seen a miracle and they begin to worship Paul.
[time=2025] They begin to worship Barnabas, Barnabas and Paul, like literally worship them.
[time=2029] And it says in 14, 14, but when the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd crying out and saying, "Men, why are you doing these things?
[time=2042] We are also men of the same nature as you and preach the gospel to you.
[time=2048] That you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them." So there's Paul in the midst of the crowd proclaiming the great and glorious gospel.
[time=2062] And how does that go for him?
[time=2064] Look at 19, but Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having won over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
[time=2080] Some of you know this story, others, if you don't, for some, this is the first time you're hearing this.
[time=2084] Yes, it's true.
[time=2085] They killed him.
[time=2088] I mean, they literally stoned him to death.
[time=2091] They threw large rocks on his body and killed him.
[time=2097] And they, in that day, would drag that dead corpse out of the city and throw it on a pile outside the city wall.
[time=2103] And this is what they did to Paul because he stood for what was right.
[time=2107] He proclaimed the truth.
[time=2109] He communicated the gospel.
[time=2111] And they hated it.
[time=2115] And they stoned him to death.
[time=2121] You say, well, what happened?
[time=2123] Well, next verse.
[time=2124] This is amazing.
[time=2125] We've looked at this before and years gone by.
[time=2128] I'm sure we'll look at it again.
[time=2129] Look at this.
[time=2130] But while the disciples stood around him, he what?
[time=2135] He got up and entered the city.
[time=2140] The next day, he went away with Barnabas to Derby.
[time=2144] Okay, now, wait a minute.
[time=2145] I just want to make sure you see this.
[time=2147] He got up.
[time=2149] He's miraculously revived.
[time=2151] He just got stoned to death by an angry mob who threw rocks on him till his life was gone.
[time=2160] God raises him up.
[time=2161] He stands up.
[time=2162] He's got Derby this way.
[time=2164] He's got the city he was just in where the angry mob was this way.
[time=2170] And he goes back inside.
[time=2173] And I just say that to you because I want you to know, Paul knew something about remaining on.
[time=2180] Paul knew something about staying in places where it got difficult and where it got tough and where it got dangerous and where it got discouraging and where it got dark.
[time=2193] And so he says to Timothy, remain on.
[time=2196] That's why Paul says in Second Timothy, flip over to the second letter to Timothy, if you would.
[time=2202] Second Timothy one, encouraging and exhorting him again.
[time=2207] He says in Second Timothy one, three to eight.
[time=2213] With Timothy clearly in view, he says, I thank God whom I serve with a clear conscience.
[time=2219] The way my forefathers did.
[time=2221] As I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day, longing to see you, Timothy, even as I recall your tears.
[time=2231] So that I may be filled with joy for I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice.
[time=2241] And I am sure that it is in you as well.
[time=2245] For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
[time=2252] For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, Timothy, but of power and love and discipline.
[time=2261] Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me, his prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God.
[time=2275] My friends, I invite you just to look through those five verses.
[time=2278] In those five verses we learn this about Timothy the pastor, the leader of the Ephesian church.
[time=2284] You'll see it on the screen.
[time=2286] He cried.
[time=2287] Verse four, longing to see you, even as I recall your tears.
[time=2291] This most certainly refers to the day when Paul left.
[time=2295] Timothy just weeps.
[time=2297] He's so unsure.
[time=2298] He's so uncertain.
[time=2299] He's so scared.
[time=2300] He cries.
[time=2301] He loves this guy so much.
[time=2303] Ministry is hard.
[time=2306] He cries.
[time=2307] He questions his faith.
[time=2309] You saw there as we read through that passage, Paul trying to reaffirm him that I believe your faith is genuine.
[time=2315] He questions his faith.
[time=2316] You know what?
[time=2317] Ministry is confusing.
[time=2320] There are times when you sometimes tell people things that truth be told even confuse you.
[time=2328] He was allowing his spiritual gift to get rusty.
[time=2331] Paul has to tell him, kindle of fresh, the gift that is in you.
[time=2335] Sometimes ministry is busy.
[time=2337] You get going a thousand different directions doing it.
[time=2339] A thousand different things and the one thing God gifted you to do, you let get a little rusty.
[time=2345] He was getting timid.
[time=2347] You see that in the passage.
[time=2349] Ministry can be scary.
[time=2351] He was tempted to be ashamed or embarrassed of the message.
[time=2355] Sometimes ministry is lonely and you're tempted to say things or not say things in order to keep a crowd.
[time=2362] No, Paul knew exactly what Timothy was up against and so he reminds Timothy.
[time=2367] Listen, this is God's call on your life.
[time=2371] This is what he created and crafted you to do.
[time=2374] Do it, Timothy.
[time=2375] Don't fade away.
[time=2376] Don't hide.
[time=2377] Step, step into it.
[time=2379] Not away from it.
[time=2381] Stay at it.
[time=2382] Lead with courage and boldness is his message.
[time=2386] Remain on.
[time=2390] And a reminder to the church as well.
[time=2394] No one can say for certain who wrote Hebrews.
[time=2398] Some will offer a number of different names but some will mention Paul in that discussion and whether Paul wrote it or didn't isn't really the point.
[time=2405] It certainly is a great truth for the church to keep in mind.
[time=2409] Hebrews 1317, while Timothy is to be bold and courageous, step into it and not fade away, Hebrews 1317 says obey your leaders.
[time=2420] And submit to them, church.
[time=2423] For they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account, let them do this with joy and not with what?
[time=2433] With grief.
[time=2434] For this would be for you to do it in a way that would bring grief.
[time=2438] He says this would be unprofitable for you.
[time=2443] Remain on.
[time=2445] Paul says to Timothy.
[time=2447] Stay at it.
[time=2448] And the second thing he says, we saw it earlier, is instruct.
[time=2453] Remain on, Timothy, and instruct your family.
[time=2457] Instruct the church.
[time=2460] Paul reminds Timothy and makes clear for all of us today that one of the most important roles that a pastor plays is the role of teaching, instructing, and equipping the church.
[time=2471] I really hope you'll write this down.
[time=2473] I think it's so very true.
[time=2475] The people of God, in order to do the work of God, need a deep and personal understanding
[time=2482] of the Word of God.
[time=2485] We really believe that's true here.
[time=2488] I really believe that that's accurate.
[time=2491] The people of God, in order to do the work of God, need a deep and personal understanding of the Word of God.
[time=2498] If we're not giving you a deep and personal understanding of the Word of God, not only
[time=2504] what it means, not only what it says, but how it can apply to your life, we've done you
[time=2510] a massive disservice.
[time=2513] The people of God, in order to do the work of God, the work of God in your home, the work of God in your relationships, the work of God abroad, the work of God anywhere.
[time=2522] As you function as the priesthood of believers, there must be at the core of who you are,
[time=2528] an understanding of, an insight into, and the ability to grasp this truth in a way that makes
[time=2536] sense in the everyday of your life.
[time=2539] So it's what I give myself to, it's what we give ourselves to here on so many fronts,
[time=2545] with your kids and with your students, and as we gather here in this setting.
[time=2551] Well, he gets specific here.
[time=2553] He says in verse three, "Don't let anyone teach a strange doctrine."
[time=2559] Verse three.
[time=2560] And then in verse four, he says, "Make sure you stay away from myths and endless genealogies,
[time=2566] which give rise to mere speculation." Now, that might sound complicated to you, but it's not.
[time=2573] Let's just break it down phrase by phrase.
[time=2575] Let me show you what he means and what this can mean to you and me.
[time=2579] Let's start with verse three, he says, "Stay away from strange doctrines."
[time=2585] Stay away from strange doctrines.
[time=2587] Literally, this phrase would be translated a different kind of truth.
[time=2594] Stay away from truth that is in truth.
[time=2597] Stay away from a different kind of truth than the truth you've been given.
[time=2603] Think about this.
[time=2606] There was the teaching of Jesus passed on directly to the apostles.
[time=2615] Then we've talked about it already this morning.
[time=2618] There was this divine inspiration, this divine revelation that came from God to the apostles.
[time=2625] There was what's called apostolic teaching.
[time=2629] This is the foundation of the epistles and much of what we have here in the New Testament, apostolic teaching.
[time=2636] So there was this teaching that came from God to the apostles that the apostles pass on
[time=2642] to us, and then there was teaching that was creeping in.
[time=2646] There was teaching and messages that were starting to surface that weren't from the apostles.
[time=2653] False teaching.
[time=2656] Now, listen, it's very important for us because this very same thing is going on today.
[time=2661] This different kind of doctrine, if you will, that was gaining speed mainly had to do with
[time=2668] the fact that some were already proclaiming a different gospel.
[time=2673] When it came to how you were saved, when it came to how one knew that they were in relationship
[time=2682] with God, when it came to an understanding of personal redemption, when it came to assurance
[time=2690] eternal life, when it came to the gospel, there were already those who were beginning to teach
[time=2697] a different gospel, and in many cases it had to do with works.
[time=2702] Judaism wasn't far removed from the centrality of God and his dealings with his people.
[time=2708] And there were those who were trying to bring back in this idea of you've got to do this and you've got to do that and you've got to perform and you've got to measure up.
[time=2718] Paul comes at it hard.
[time=2720] Paul takes it very seriously.
[time=2722] How seriously?
[time=2723] Look at Galatians.
[time=2724] Same issue.
[time=2725] The gospel is being attacked.
[time=2728] Go to Galatians chapter 1.
[time=2732] Go to Galatians 1-6.
[time=2734] Turn there real quick, would you?
[time=2736] Let me read this to you.
[time=2737] Galatians 1-6.
[time=2738] All I want to say is the gospel is under attack and watch and listen as Paul responds.
[time=2744] "I am amazed," he said, "that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ
[time=2751] for a different gospel." Which is really not another.
[time=2758] Only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
[time=2764] But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we
[time=2771] have preached to you already, he is to be a cursed, damned, as we have said before.
[time=2779] So I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received,
[time=2787] he is to be a cursed.
[time=2792] So it's a really big deal.
[time=2794] It really is.
[time=2796] And when you and I hear today on the airwaves, when you and I hear as we turn on the TV, when you and I read, as we walk through a bookstore, whenever you hear that the gospel is wrapped up in health and wealth and prosperity, whenever you hear those who are saying that
[time=2813] the way to God is a faith in which he wants you to be happy and positive and prosperous
[time=2820] and wealthy.
[time=2825] And we can list four, five, six, seven other approaches that you and I will hear today.
[time=2832] The fact is that's a lie.
[time=2834] Jesus said, "If you're going to follow him, you're going to die." Jesus said, "If you're going to follow him, you're going to pick up your cross, this instrument of persecution." Jesus said, "If you're going to follow him, you're going to give everything you have away." Those who follow Jesus gave everything they had away.
[time=2855] Jesus paints a picture of relationship with him as certainly joyous and filled with blessing.
[time=2863] It's a blessing that comes when one's willing to sacrifice, not gain, give, not get.
[time=2872] Now there's some very foundational tenets to the gospel and whether it's the abuse it
[time=2878] takes today or the abuse it was taking here, Paul takes it very, very seriously, which is why I think it's really important that we just take a minute.
[time=2885] For many of you, it'll be review for others of you.
[time=2887] It could be very, very informative.
[time=2890] For some of you, it may even be today significant in your spiritual journey.
[time=2895] Let's just understand real quickly.
[time=2897] I've drawn this for you before.
[time=2898] I want you to see it again, get out of pen, get out of blank sheet of paper, draw this
[time=2904] with me as we go.
[time=2905] We're going to kind of make our way through it quickly, but I want you to catch the foundation of the gospel message.
[time=2911] Hey, parents, listen, your kids should understand the gospel.
[time=2917] Do they?
[time=2919] Grandmas and grandpas, you get a chance to be one who passes along the gospel and the truth of what God has done for those little ones that maybe you get a chance to influence.
[time=2930] I'm learning that even college kids still need to be reminded of and discussed with
[time=2937] the implications of and the foundations of this truth that God has given us.
[time=2943] Please don't ever grow weary or tired of the gospel, my friends.
[time=2949] It is the foundation of what God has done and it provides a strength and courage for the future.
[time=2954] So here you go.
[time=2955] Just remember, you've got man on one side of this chasm and you've got God on the other side of this chasm.
[time=2961] It is a deep chasm that one cannot jump, one cannot span by him or herself.
[time=2968] On the one side, you have God and you see the light around God, you see the circle.
[time=2972] God is holy.
[time=2973] The Bible teaches this.
[time=2974] The God is perfect.
[time=2975] God in his perfect holy state can have nothing to do with sinfulness, let alone sinful man.
[time=2981] On the other side, not holy, not perfect, definitely sinful.
[time=2986] And you know what?
[time=2987] There's those arrows that you'll see there next to the man.
[time=2989] I always draw those arrows there because every man I've ever met and every person I've ever
[time=2995] had a spiritual conversation with has something deep inside them that makes them want to get
[time=3001] across that baby to the other side.
[time=3006] I believe it's because man was made in the image of God and man knows that he was designed to be with God and yet now there is this chasm due to sin that separates.
[time=3017] So there's man and there's God and there's that desire to get across that and yet we're in trouble from the get-go.
[time=3023] Romans 3, 23 says that every one of us have sinned and with our sin, just one, the Scriptures
[time=3030] teach that we fall short of the glory of God.
[time=3035] Verse 6 goes on to say in verse 23 that the wages of that sin, wages, what you earn, but
[time=3042] the wages of that sin is death.
[time=3046] Physical death, yes, but spiritual death as well.
[time=3049] The wages of sin is death, so man is stuck in his sinfulness, still wanting to get across.
[time=3058] Here's where false teaching comes in, I mean that.
[time=3061] Sometimes we get false teaching from the day we were born, sometimes we bump into it later, but false teaching comes along and tries to teach man that there are some ways you can get across.
[time=3072] Some people get taught that you can just be a good person, there you see the heart.
[time=3077] Some literally think that somehow they can muster up enough goodness, enough kindness,
[time=3084] enough benevolence to somehow merit salvation and eternal life.
[time=3089] The Scriptures would clearly disagree, you aren't good enough, never will be, never
[time=3096] could be.
[time=3098] Some actually think and some have been taught they can give their way to heaven, you can write a check, you can give large sums of money or you can give small sums, the realm,
[time=3107] the whole of your life, either way, some think you can buy your way into happiness and you
[time=3113] can't.
[time=3115] Some think you can walk into a building like this, you know a church with a steeple, so to speak, something church attendance or at least a good average of church attendance
[time=3125] gets you in that doesn't, so we're stuck.
[time=3130] And then the gospel, which means what?
[time=3134] Good news.
[time=3135] Then the gospel kicks in, John 3.16, God just out of his unbelievable, unfathomable, everlasting love for God so loved the world, John 3.16, that He gave His Son that whosoever
[time=3148] would believe in Him, whoever would believe in the truth of this picture would not perish.
[time=3155] Now all of a sudden deaths off the table, now all of a sudden we get life because of what
[time=3161] Jesus did for God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[time=3170] The disciples were curious as we would be about eternal life.
[time=3175] They asked Jesus about eternal life and Jesus was unbelievably clear.
[time=3181] He said, "I am Me, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Jesus of Nazareth.
[time=3186] I am the way, the truth and the life.
[time=3189] No man.
[time=3191] No woman, nobody, anywhere, at any time, no one gets to the Father but by Me.
[time=3205] Some have said to me over the years, "My goodness, how arrogant, through which I have always replied, 'My goodness, how loving.
[time=3214] Are you kidding me?
[time=3216] You're hosed, dude, whoever you are, you're going nowhere.
[time=3220] You're stuck and you're sinfulness and you're going to call it arrogance.
[time=3222] No, it's love.
[time=3223] He loved you and He's giving you a way to experience life."
[time=3230] Unbelievable.
[time=3231] And so we have the privilege because of the cross, of crossing over into relationship with God.
[time=3237] Romans 10, 9 and 10, I love this.
[time=3241] You confess with your mouth, let's just read it, Romans 10, 9 and 10.
[time=3246] So important to kind of just catch every word here of what this verse says.
[time=3251] It says that if you confess with your mouth, Jesus as Lord, if you believe the gospel and
[time=3259] believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, the great truth of the gospel,
[time=3266] you will be saved.
[time=3269] For with the heart, a person believes resulting in righteousness and with the mouth, he confesses
[time=3275] resulting in salvation.
[time=3278] So very important, my friends, that you understand the foundation of the gospel.
[time=3283] Is that the gospel?
[time=3284] In total, no, there's implications of these truths all throughout your lives.
[time=3287] The gospel applies to your marriage.
[time=3292] The gospel applies to how we handle our finances.
[time=3295] The implications are enormous, but understand today this is the truth.
[time=3302] This is the gospel and we are not to teach any other kind of gospel, amen?
[time=3309] Back to 1 Timothy, he goes on in verse 4, I want you to see what he says there.
[time=3315] 1 Timothy 1, 4, he says, in 3, instruct them not to teach strange doctrines, 4, nor to
[time=3323] pay attention to myths and endless genealogies which give rise to mere speculation.
[time=3331] Instead, he says, further the administration of God, which is by faith.
[time=3336] So you see it there on the screen, look at this, my friends, stay away from Paul encourages
[time=3343] Timothy to instruct his people to, and he encourages us, those of us who are teachers
[time=3350] here at Blackhawk to teach you and instruct you to stay away from discussions and debates
[time=3360] that simply promote meaningless, fruitless discussion and spiritual guessing.
[time=3367] It happens way too often.
[time=3371] It takes up way too much of our time.
[time=3375] It sends you and I down trails.
[time=3376] We need not travel.
[time=3378] He says, stay away from it.
[time=3380] There were myths probably tied to Judaism against, still it wasn't that far away, and
[time=3386] there were probably genealogies possibly from Genesis that folks were somehow kind of getting their arms around and trying to debate and talk about and enter into discussions about and Paul says, whoa, stop, it doesn't mean anything.
[time=3398] Deal with, concentrate on what means something.
[time=3403] And even as you do that, don't get stuck, teach, teach, explain, equip, learn, apply,
[time=3410] but let's not do the quarreling thing, let's not do the arguing thing, let's not do the debating thing.
[time=3416] He had this on his heart in 2 Timothy 2.
[time=3419] Look what it says there in 2 Timothy 2, 23 and 24.
[time=3424] You see it there on the screen, but refuse Timothy, refuse foolish and ignorant speculations
[time=3430] knowing that they produce quarrels and he goes on in 24 to say, the Lord's bond servant,
[time=3436] you Timothy, must not be quarrel.
[time=3438] So in 1 Timothy 6, 3 comes back and addresses that very same point.
[time=3444] If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with sound words, those of
[time=3451] our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine conforming to godliness, if someone's against
[time=3459] that stuff, keep going, verse 4 says, he is conceited and understands nothing, but he
[time=3465] has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words out of which arise
[time=3472] envy, strife, abuse of language, evil suspicions and on and on it goes as people argue, constant
[time=3481] friction between men and of depraved mind and deprived of the truth.
[time=3511] .
