[time=280] Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=282] It's great to have you here with us, and I'm thankful to get to spend just these few minutes with you.
[time=287] I want to tell you about an opportunity you have each and every week, actually each and every day,
[time=293] a resource that I think could be very valuable for you in your spiritual journey, a resource that could be very informative for you.
[time=302] As you get to know us better here at Blackhawk, a resource that I think would be very not only informative and encouraging,
[time=309] but I think really, really inspiring for you, and that is our website.
[time=314] I want you to go to BlackhawkMinistries.org sometime real soon, and I want you to just kind of make your way through the website,
[time=321] and as you do, I want you to realize how many things there are that God is doing in and through this place and these people.
[time=328] I want you to see the opportunities that are there for you to grow and for you to continue to understand what God may have for you.
[time=336] I especially want to just remind each and every one of you to take some time and look at the digging deeper resource.
[time=342] I hear from so many of you how much you appreciate the messages week after week.
[time=348] I hear from so many of you who talk about the difference that God's Word is making in your life,
[time=354] and I want you to know that while we enjoy hearing from you and while I'm thankful for the 40 minutes or so
[time=360] that we get to spend in God's Word together each week, 40 minutes isn't going to do it.
[time=366] You need a chance to dig deeper. You need a chance to understand better and more thoroughly what we've talked about,
[time=373] and the digging deeper resource can help you do that.
[time=377] So go to our website and click on the media icon, and there it will take you to a chance where you can watch the messages again,
[time=387] a chance where you can click on the digging deeper material, and it will give you a chance to, as the days go by through the week,
[time=395] read and think and interact more with the message from the previous Sunday.
[time=401] I hope that you can understand how important it is to us.
[time=405] We don't want to just preach messages. We want people to grow spiritually.
[time=410] We want you to better understand God's Word and the implications it has for your life.
[time=415] And so we hope you'll dig. We hope you'll jump in and dig deeper and better understand the great life-changing truth.
[time=422] It's a joy. It really is. It's a joy for us to bring it to you.
[time=426] Our hope is that beyond the broadcast, you can take it in, wrestle with it, chew on it, and really be transformed by the truth of the Scriptures.
[time=436] Hey, I hope you enjoy the website. Look around. If you have any questions at all, please give us a call.
[time=441] We'd love to answer any of those. It's great to have you with us today. Thank you for tuning in, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
