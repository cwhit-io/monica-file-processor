[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] [MUSIC - 99 seconds]
[time=143] - We've enjoyed learning that song together over the last few weeks or so and meditating
[time=158] on the truth captured in those verses in particular.
[time=163] You saw on the screen that the power of Jesus' name, it's all over scriptures and it's captured in the poetry in that song, in Jesus' name, dead or raised to life.
[time=173] In Jesus' name, hungry souls are filled.
[time=178] In Jesus' name, the restless find peace.
[time=181] In Jesus' name, the enemy has to leave.
[time=185] In Jesus' name, sick or healed and dead or raised.
[time=189] There is power in his name and it's been fun to think about that and meditate on that and remember that.
[time=199] I asked Brian to come today.
[time=201] In particular, a phrase up there says the sick are healed in the power of Jesus' name.
[time=207] Brian was sick and now he's healed.
[time=210] And so I want him to share a little bit about that journey with you.
[time=214] Brian and I actually met eight years ago in the Czech Republic, which is a fun story, but not the one we're gonna tell today.
[time=220] Too long, it would take too long.
[time=223] When I met him eight years ago, he was real sick and there was like a three-year period of his life where things weren't looking good for your health at all.
[time=231] Why don't you say hi, make sure that mic's working.
[time=235] - Hi. - Hi.
[time=236] - Good.
[time=237] Can you make him feel a little more comfortable by clapping or saying hello?
[time=240] (audience applauds) Brian and I have been friends for a long time.
[time=247] There's another miracle we could tell you about, which actually like getting him on stage with a guitar.
[time=251] It's so anti who God made Brian to be, but I pulled him out of that and made him play the guitar with us.
[time=258] Now I'm pulling him even farther forward and putting a mic in his hands, so he's really nervous.
[time=262] But Brian, why don't you tell him about those three years when you were really, really sick and just kind of explain to them what happened.
[time=268] Go ahead.
[time=269] - All right, yeah, it was in 2001, September of 2001, I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, which I'll explain this time, so you don't have to ask.
[time=277] Ulcerative colitis is kind of what it sounds like.
[time=280] It's ulcer is in your colon, so it's your body kind of deciding that it doesn't really like itself and it's eating itself, essentially, I guess.
[time=289] Yeah.
[time=290] So it was treated in 2000 and it went away for about a year and came back in September of 2001.
[time=297] In October 1st of 2001, which is kind of the beginning book end of the three year period, I called a good friend of mine who happened to be a nurse practitioner and said, "Hey, I think I need to go to the hospital." - And who now happens to be your wife?
[time=311] - Yes. - Okay.
[time=312] That's later in the story.
[time=313] - That's a good story, too.
[time=315] - She wasn't at that point, we were good friends, we weren't even dating, so.
[time=318] So it went into the hospital, and I think that the quickest way, I think, to run down that three years is just to run down some numbers.
[time=327] I'm not really a numbers guy, but I think that makes the most sense.
[time=330] I was 26 years old, it was a three year period.
[time=334] In that three years, I had three major surgeries, spent 33 days in the hospital, got 11 units of blood, I don't really know how much that is in normal people terms, but. - 11, that's a lot.
[time=347] - Had my colon removed, which is about six feet of your insides, the entire thing was removed, and at one point weighed somewhere between 90 and 100 pounds, I think that was a picture before.
[time=360] When I weighed that, the surgeon wanted to get me
[time=366] in the hospital and kind of bulk me up to do the surgery because he was afraid that I wouldn't live through the surgery at that weight.
[time=372] Then, the second night I was in the hospital, my colon perforated, which just got a hole in it, which meant that I had to do emergency surgery because what was inside my colon was trying to get outside into the rest of my stomach.
[time=384] - 90 pounds or not, you were going to surgery.
[time=387] - Right.
[time=388] So that's kind of the numbers.
[time=391] Some of the themes that went on in that three year period, too, is during that first surgery, I had just left a job.
[time=396] So when that happened, I had no job and no insurance, which amounted to somewhere in an $80,000 range of hospital bills, which is a whole nother story of those were all taken care of, too, that God provided in that way.
[time=409] And then, the rest of that three year period, I got a job, eventually, moved to the Czech Republic, where I'm at Corbin, moved back to the States and lived with my in-laws, which I got married in between that.
[time=423] So got married, then moved back to the States and lived with my in-laws.
[time=427] And then, the other bookend of that three year period is October 24, October 21, of 2004, was the birth of our first son.
[time=435] So that's the three year period.
[time=438] - It was an adventure.
[time=440] - To say the least.
[time=441] So in three years, a disease, hospitalizations, blood transfusions, pain, lots of pain, right?
[time=448] Fear, a new colon, it's kind of interesting.
[time=453] - Oh, right.
[time=454] - You don't have to tell them about the bag.
[time=456] - Okay, good.
[time=457] - You told him the first hour about this bag, you don't want to know about the bag.
[time=461] Just trust me, he got a new colon and we're thankful for it.
[time=464] But yeah, God has healed you.
[time=468] And you know what?
[time=469] I want to throw you for a loop a little bit 'cause we talked about this in my office.
[time=473] Tell them about an idol that you had in your life and what God did to kind of knock it down or take it away.
[time=482] - Yeah, through this three year fearful tragedy medical situation, tell them about that.
[time=488] - Yeah, prior to that, I've always been in sports and been pretty healthy and fit and strong and everything.
[time=494] I think one of the things that I feared most in life was being helpless, not being able to do everything for myself and not being able to even place sports into all that kind of stuff.
[time=503] And through the course of those three years, I mean, there were times when I couldn't even get off a couch by myself, I couldn't walk by myself, I couldn't do anything by myself.
[time=515] So it was a drastic removal, I think, of that idol.
[time=520] But in the midst of all that, he provided, one of the names that was up there was Jehovah Shalom.
[time=524] And I think that's another theme in this story is not just healing, but it's just God's peace in the middle of all of that.
[time=530] That really, I feel like in reading our journals now, 10 years later, just as all over.
[time=537] - So you put your hope in self-sufficiency, a little bit more than Jesus.
[time=542] And he removed your ability to be self-sufficient for a number of years.
[time=548] I love how he does that.
[time=550] I don't love that you had to go through hard things, but I love that he's faithful to teach us good lessons in the midst of hard things.
[time=557] Tell him too, just a description of how God met you.
[time=563] We sing specifically about calling on the name of Jesus and where there are moments in your journey where there was nothing else to do but call on his name.
[time=571] - Yeah, there were a lot of moments like that.
[time=574] Yeah, the pain is, I don't know if there's words to describe what it is, it was intense.
[time=581] And there were times when, I mean, I literally couldn't think to do anything else, but just cry out the name of Jesus.
[time=588] And I had the Holy Spirit intercede with what words should be there.
[time=593] 'Cause I couldn't, yeah, there were no words.
[time=595] It was just crying out to Jesus.
[time=596] And in those times, even reading my journals later, I find that there were times where I felt like the pain and the fear was kind of getting away from me.
[time=605] And it's kind of like, I think of Peter, I guess, looking away from Jesus on the water and sinking.
[time=608] And it felt like that.
[time=610] And then turning back and feeling that peace, even though sometimes the pain was still there, it was just God providing peace.
[time=617] There was an excerpt from my journal where I talked to her.
[time=621] I didn't feel like God was healing my body now, but he was providing healing by giving me the miracle of peace.
[time=627] And I just think that's an amazing thing that only he can do in the middle of something like that, is still give you peace.
[time=633] - Yeah, that's really good.
[time=635] In his ways weren't your ways.
[time=638] Brian wanted immediate relief from the pain.
[time=641] You didn't get it immediately, but you've got it, you know, years removed.
[time=645] And he promises that there will be no pain and no tear in the life here after when we're completely redeemed into the new creation that he's designed us to be.
[time=655] And so thanks for sharing.
[time=657] Can you thank him for being courageous to share a little bit?
[time=660] (audience applauding) I want to Brian to share because I want God to get the glory publicly for what he's been doing in Brian's life.
[time=673] I also want to Brian to share today because some of you might find yourself in the midst of a really difficult season of life.
[time=681] When you feel like there's a storm about you or a drought, maybe spiritually.
[time=687] And I just want to remind you that Jesus is gonna be faithful to teach you what you need to learn in the midst of this.
[time=695] And he's also gonna be faithful to provide you an ultimate healing in his time and in his way, in his design and his plan.
[time=703] And we just need to be yielded to them.
[time=706] Would you stand with us for gonna sing a song together to just remind us that it's in Christ alone that our hope is found.
[time=714] Let's sing this.
[time=715] [MUSIC - 83 seconds]
[time=803] Let's sing this next verse out.
[time=817] It speaks of Christ's triumph over the grave.
[time=821] Let's sing it with all of our hearts again.
[time=826] [MUSIC - 103 seconds]
[time=941] (upbeat music) [AMEN]
[time=961] (audience applauding) God, we are thankful that we can remind each other
[time=971] of the truth that we just sang.
[time=973] God, no power of hell can pluck us from your hand.
[time=980] No scheme of human nature can pluck us from your hand.
[time=985] And we need to be reminded of that today, God.
[time=988] As we face the fiercest droughts and the fiercest storms that we sang about, we can put our hope in our firm foundation in you, Jesus.
[time=1000] And I pray that you would empower us to be faithful to do just that.
[time=1004] Whether in season or out of season in good times or bad times, God, help us to fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith and the one who promises to make it all good in the end.
[time=1019] Forgive us, God, for not being patient to wait to the end.
[time=1024] 'Cause we don't know when the end is, sometimes it's just around the corner, sometimes it's in a few years, sometimes it's a long, long ways away.
[time=1032] But no matter what, God, you will fulfill your promise to make it good in the end.
[time=1038] And so we pray that you would help us to put our hope in that, in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1044] Thanks for singing, you may be seated.
[time=1047] We're gonna transition here to Steve Webster.
[time=1052] Is he gonna come and teach us more about first Timothy?
[time=1055] - Thanks, Carmen. - Okay, thanks.
[time=1058] I wanna make the most of the time.
[time=1059] We're gonna redeem the time 'cause the days are evil.
[time=1062] So I'm just gonna jump right in.
[time=1064] I was talking with Brian between the service about healing.
[time=1068] And Corbin's words were very appropriate.
[time=1073] You know, I know that some of you have prayed to God in the face of a grave illness, of a loved one, and they have not been physically healed.
[time=1082] They've passed away.
[time=1085] My dear friend from high school called me early last week and said that his stepdad was in the hospital and this time last Sunday, he was fine.
[time=1097] And by Friday, he was gone.
[time=1098] And we prayed for him.
[time=1102] And Brian said it very beautifully between services.
[time=1108] My friend's stepdad is healed this morning.
[time=1112] He's healed in the most complete way.
[time=1115] Anybody can be healed, he's in the presence of God, rejoicing in his presence.
[time=1120] So I want to encourage you.
[time=1122] I know that circumstances might seem as though that when you pray for someone who is gravely ill or even yourself, you have a debilitating illness and you're praying and you're praying that God would heal you.
[time=1133] He doesn't heal you in the way that we might expect.
[time=1135] It doesn't mean that healing isn't coming.
[time=1138] God is faithful.
[time=1139] And I wanna encourage you without this morning.
[time=1141] I know that many of you are in that place right now or you have been in that place.
[time=1146] Someone that you know is in that place now.
[time=1147] I wanna encourage you with that.
[time=1149] Please open your Bibles to First Timothy chapter one.
[time=1152] We're gonna be jumping in verse 12.
[time=1154] And in this passage, Paul tells a little bit of his story.
[time=1160] And with that, I'll just tell you a little bit of my story.
[time=1165] As we started this morning, I've been here at Black Hawk Ministries for eight years teaching at the school, which is over there.
[time=1173] For most of it, the last year, I've had the privilege of being an afternoon pastor at the church.
[time=1178] I teach in the morning at the school and do afternoon stuff at the church, including teaching, which we're doing right now.
[time=1185] That's not where my story, that's not all of my story.
[time=1188] I was born in the early months of Richard Nixon's second term in Owasso, Michigan, which is right there.
[time=1199] Michigan, there's no rape, so you got it.
[time=1201] Right there, Owasso, Michigan.
[time=1203] My dad's dad was a farmer and a factory worker.
[time=1208] My mom's dad was a engineer for Ford Motor Company for over 40 years.
[time=1214] Very hardworking salt of the earth people.
[time=1217] My grandparents were married for over 60 years, almost 60 years, I should say.
[time=1223] I was born into that kind of a heritage.
[time=1225] My parents are retired.
[time=1227] They'll be here next week from Florida, where I wish I was today, along with all of you, I'm sure.
[time=1232] They're coming this way, I don't really get that, but I guess it's the grandkids.
[time=1236] They're coming up, they're both retired, they're doing whatever they want now, which is a real blessing.
[time=1243] They both knew the Lord before I was born.
[time=1245] They got married in 1969.
[time=1248] I grew up in their house and I got to my teenage years
[time=1255] and I was a very moral person, a very moral, a good person, because I was afraid of the consequences from my parents if I did bad things.
[time=1266] I didn't do the right things because, no, I shouldn't say that.
[time=1270] I didn't avoid the bad things 'cause I was righteous.
[time=1273] I avoided them because I didn't want to disappoint my parents.
[time=1277] And so I was a moral person.
[time=1278] My life was categorized by a profound insecurity, not like typical teenage insecurity, there was that, there was enough of that.
[time=1287] But there was a real soul insecurity in my life.
[time=1290] Deeply, I would stare at my ceiling fan every night, remember it very vividly.
[time=1295] In fear of my soul, who am I?
[time=1297] I know what you've called me to, God, but I'm not there.
[time=1300] I don't, his voice was very far away.
[time=1302] I was characterized by half-hearted efforts, my whole teenage life.
[time=1308] A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.
[time=1312] James said, that's who I was.
[time=1313] I was a cowardly person.
[time=1315] I was not brave enough to stand to my friends that were doing wrong things.
[time=1320] I wasn't brave enough to forge my own way.
[time=1322] That's who I was.
[time=1324] I was lost, I was double-minded, I was cowardly.
[time=1329] But that isn't the end of my story.
[time=1333] That isn't where my story ends.
[time=1336] I've told you from this pulpit, perhaps in this very spot before, that if you are in Christ, please hear me.
[time=1342] If you are in Christ, you are not defined by the worst moments of your life.
[time=1346] There are some really bad moments that Paul relates to us in this passage in his life, really bad moments.
[time=1352] He uses very strong language to describe himself.
[time=1356] I know that many of you have a story of spectacular sins from which you've been saved, and for which God should get all the glory.
[time=1365] I want you to, I want to invite you today to enter into the story that Paul is telling here, the greatest story that's ever been told, and see yourself there.
[time=1375] Let's pray as we start, and we'll walk through these verses together.
[time=1379] Father, I thank you for giving us strength.
[time=1386] I thank you for judging us faithful, and for appointing us to serve you, though we were lost and wayward and disobedient people.
[time=1399] Your grace overflowed to us, God, overflowed.
[time=1404] You displayed your perfect patience in Jesus, so that others might see and believe.
[time=1413] You've called us to fight the good fight.
[time=1416] You have equipped us by your Holy Spirit to do it.
[time=1418] May we do it today.
[time=1419] Equip us, Father, with your armor
[time=1426] to face a world that is lost.
[time=1429] May we continually and forthrightly by your Holy Spirit speak out the good news by what we do and by what we don't do.
[time=1438] We pray all these things in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1442] First Timothy 1, and verse 12 through 20.
[time=1446] We'll go through chapter one today.
[time=1447] Would you stand, please, in honor of God's word?
[time=1451] First Peter, first Timothy 1, verses 12 through 20, we'll read that together, and we'll just jump in.
[time=1456] I thank him who has given me strength.
[time=1462] Christ Jesus our Lord, because he judged me faithful, appointing me to a service.
[time=1467] But formally, I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent, but I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
[time=1484] The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.
[time=1492] But I received mercy for this reason that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life, to the king of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, beyond our own glory, forever and ever, amen.
[time=1513] Verse 18, "This charge I entrust to you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, holding faith in a good conscience.
[time=1524] By rejecting this, some have made shipwreck of their faith, among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme." You may be seated.
[time=1543] Right before this, in 1 Timothy 1, Paul lays out a massive contradiction between law and grace.
[time=1551] In his letter to the Romans in chapter five, there are references there friends throughout the outline.
[time=1556] The outline is in your bulletins today.
[time=1559] You're welcome to follow along.
[time=1561] I would encourage you to go back to these passages throughout the week and let them encourage you.
[time=1566] Let them kind of give color to the passage.
[time=1570] Romans five says, verse 20, "The law came in to increase the trespass, meaning the law told me what it was to covet, that I shouldn't covet, so I'm a sinner.
[time=1583] The law told me not to steal.
[time=1585] And so I steal whether in acts of commission, things I do or things of omission, things I don't do.
[time=1591] I rob people of time or whatever.
[time=1593] The law reveals how high my stack of sin is.
[time=1596] It's pretty high.
[time=1598] But we're sin-increased, grace abounded all the more, so that as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness, leading to eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.
[time=1613] Charles Virgin said, "The law is for the self-righteous to humble their pride." The gospel is for the lost to remove their despair.
[time=1629] The law, the 10 commandments don't save anyone, friends.
[time=1632] The 10 commandments are God's word, and they are there for a reason.
[time=1636] But teach your kids the gospel.
[time=1638] Don't teach your kids the 10 commandments.
[time=1640] I want my children not to be thieves or coveters or sexually immoral.
[time=1645] I want that for them, and so do you.
[time=1647] But that won't save them.
[time=1648] This is very, very important.
[time=1652] All law can do is increase my sin.
[time=1654] All law can do is tell me how far I have to go.
[time=1657] Grace abounds in the good news that comes through Jesus Christ.
[time=1662] Teach your kids the gospel.
[time=1663] Teach them the good news that Jesus Christ came into the world of safe sinners, and that every one of us is in need of that salvation.
[time=1670] Teach our kids that.
[time=1672] That's what they need to hear.
[time=1674] This quote attributed to two different people.
[time=1676] It's either John Bunyan or a guy named John Barrage.
[time=1679] So let's say John B.
[time=1680] John B. said this.
[time=1683] He said, "Run John and work the law commands.
[time=1688] "Get finds me neither feet or hands.
[time=1691] "But sweeter news the gospel wings.
[time=1693] "It bids me fly and lends me wings." What the law could not do, Grace did.
[time=1704] God did through his son.
[time=1706] That's the gospel.
[time=1707] That's what this story is about in 1 Timothy 1.
[time=1709] Look at verse 12 with me again.
[time=1711] The first Roman numeral in your outline there friends is overflowing Grace.
[time=1717] In verse 12 Paul says, "I thank him who has given me strength.
[time=1722] "Christ Jesus, our Lord, "I would encourage you to never forget "the source of your strength.
[time=1727] "You cannot bear up underneath the burden "that you will bear starting tomorrow morning at work.
[time=1733] "You can't do it on your own.
[time=1734] "There are too many pressures that come your way.
[time=1736] "Too many confusions, frustrations.
[time=1740] "Unfulfilled expectations.
[time=1742] "Paul is a thankful person.
[time=1744] "If you read his prayers throughout the New Testament, "he's just, they're overflowing with thankfulness.
[time=1749] "And so I have to ask you the question.
[time=1751] "Are you a thankful person?
[time=1754] "Or are you a complaining person?
[time=1756] "What do your Facebook posts look like?
[time=1760] "What kind of text messages do you send?
[time=1763] "If you don't text or if you don't use Facebook, "what are your conversations like with your friends?
[time=1770] "Younger old.
[time=1771] "Are you a complaining person about your job, "but your boss about your kids?
[time=1775] "Paul's life, Paul's ministry is categorized friends
[time=1781] "with thankfulness.
[time=1783] "And I would encourage you to follow his example "as he does often in the scriptures, "his follow my example in this way.
[time=1788] "So do it.
[time=1788] "Be a thankful person.
[time=1790] "That will not be easy.
[time=1791] "It's easy to be thankful when it's 75 degrees and sunny, "but it's not right now.
[time=1801] "I would remind you again, as with Paul, "as with me, as with you, "God has the final word about who you are.
[time=1809] "Oh, I know what you're like.
[time=1811] "You're that guy.
[time=1812] "My 20-year high school union's coming up this year.
[time=1814] "20-year high school reunion.
[time=1819] "And they all know what I was like.
[time=1820] "I was that guy.
[time=1821] "Half-hearted, lazy, insecure, "again, paralyzingly insecure.
[time=1828] "They know me as that guy.
[time=1829] "Oh, you're that guy.
[time=1830] "No, I'm not.
[time=1833] "I'm not that guy anymore.
[time=1835] "God has the final word about who you are.
[time=1838] "Some of you are not in that place yet.
[time=1839] "Some of you are still here.
[time=1840] "You're not in Christ.
[time=1841] "I want to encourage you, friends, "that the good news of the gospel is that you're not bound "to always be who you are.
[time=1850] "Litter A in your outline says, "The known is beyond God's reach.
[time=1856] "That's totally true.
[time=1859] "Look how Paul describes himself.
[time=1860] "A persecutor, a blasphemer.
[time=1866] "Those are words that are not used very often in the Bible.
[time=1868] "They're used very few times.
[time=1869] "And Paul used them up himself.
[time=1871] "He was an insolent opponent," the ESV says.
[time=1875] The NIV says he was a violent man.
[time=1877] The NSB says he was a violent aggressor.
[time=1880] And that guy, he was, look at Acts 8 with me.
[time=1885] Acts 8 and 9 give you Paul's story.
[time=1887] Saul, Saul's story.
[time=1889] Acts 8, you'll be on the screens behind me.
[time=1893] Acts 8, 1, says Saul approved of his execution.
[time=1898] His, they're referring to Stephen.
[time=1900] Take a minute this week and read through Acts 7.
[time=1903] Stephen lays out the entire store of the Old Testament about 53 verses.
[time=1906] It's fantastic.
[time=1907] He was the first man to give his life for Christ.
[time=1910] And there rose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem before I go on in verse 1.
[time=1917] Let me just unpack that Saul approved of his execution.
[time=1920] What was the Jewish method of execution?
[time=1923] Stoning.
[time=1924] Stoning was there was a pit.
[time=1927] They threw a person into the pit.
[time=1929] They threw large rocks at their head until they were dead.
[time=1932] That's exceptionally violent, exceptionally personal.
[time=1937] Stephen saw the men who threw rocks at his head until he was dead.
[time=1943] And Saul approved of this.
[time=1945] It's a good thing that Stephen should die.
[time=1947] It's the kind of guy he was.
[time=1950] A kind of guy that rejoiced in what was evil.
[time=1952] So, verse two, "Develop men buried Stephen "and made great lamentation over him, "but Saul was ravaging the church.
[time=1962] "Entering house after house, he dragged off men and women "and committed them to prison." Acts 9 tells us more of his story.
[time=1971] It says in verse one that he was breathing out threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord.
[time=1976] And then he's on his way to Damascus.
[time=1980] I'm summarizing here.
[time=1982] And he meets Jesus.
[time=1984] I'm interested, friends.
[time=1985] It says in Acts 9, verse five.
[time=1989] After Jesus addresses Saul, he says, "Who are you, Lord?" And he says, "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting."
[time=1999] He was persecuting Jesus or his disciples.
[time=2003] And the answer is, "There's no break." When you suffer persecution, for his sake, there is no break between that and God himself, Christ himself, identifies with your suffering on his behalf.
[time=2016] That should be marvelously encouraging to you.
[time=2021] There's no break.
[time=2022] He's not unfamiliar with your difficult circumstances.
[time=2027] He's not unaware of it.
[time=2029] God isn't distant in good luck with all that down there.
[time=2032] It's not his posture.
[time=2034] It's not what he's like.
[time=2035] The cross, by the way, is the ultimate answer to that question.
[time=2039] Does God care about my suffering?
[time=2040] And the answer is he does care about your suffering.
[time=2043] He's entered into it and taken it upon himself and the person of his son.
[time=2047] Friends, let this stuff just crash like waves over you this week.
[time=2052] Read these passages again and again and again.
[time=2054] And be encouraged by what God says about himself, about what he's done.
[time=2058] Paul received mercy because he was acting ignorantly in unbelief.
[time=2061] That's what it says there.
[time=2062] But it doesn't mean like it excuses his behavior.
[time=2064] It says he doesn't deserve it.
[time=2066] Which is letter B in your outline.
[time=2068] Letter A was, "The known is beyond God's reach." It's totally true.
[time=2073] If you're listening on the internet or watching on the internet, if you're here today, if you're in the sound of my voice, wherever that is.
[time=2082] And you think, I don't know what you think, Webster, but I know what I've done and God can't go that far.
[time=2088] And the answer is that you're wrong.
[time=2090] Amen?
[time=2093] Believers in the room.
[time=2094] There is nobody beyond the reach of God's saving power.
[time=2098] Nobody.
[time=2100] If you are breathing and you can hear me, that's the gospel.
[time=2104] That's the gospel.
[time=2108] No one deserves it.
[time=2108] Letter B Kelly was there last week.
[time=2110] I'm reminding you of what he said.
[time=2113] No one deserves to be saved or else it wouldn't be grace.
[time=2116] Grace is something somebody does that they're not obligated to do.
[time=2121] It's often referred to as unmerited favor.
[time=2125] It's undeserved favor.
[time=2127] It wouldn't be grace if I deserved it.
[time=2129] So Paul isn't doing God a favor by getting saved.
[time=2132] I'm glad Paul's on my team now.
[time=2134] All right.
[time=2134] That's not his attitude.
[time=2137] Grace overflows for Saul, who becomes Paul.
[time=2144] Grace is only grace if it is not deserved.
[time=2148] The word that he uses for overflow there is it in verse 14.
[time=2152] His grace overflowed is the Greek prefix is hyper.
[time=2157] It hyper flowed.
[time=2158] His grace hyper flowed.
[time=2161] It's a word that you'd use for a cup that was filled up too much and just kept spilling out.
[time=2165] That's not Ebenezer's screws to the grace.
[time=2168] That's enough.
[time=2170] That's enough for you.
[time=2172] You're not Jacob Marley in the story.
[time=2174] You know, getting, he doesn't know the story of Christmas.
[time=2177] Carol, okay.
[time=2178] I got no response there.
[time=2179] I just wasn't sure.
[time=2179] It's Scrooge.
[time=2180] Marley, you are those people.
[time=2182] He's not a miser.
[time=2184] He's not hoarding his grace.
[time=2185] Like I've got this and you can't have it.
[time=2187] That's not what he's like.
[time=2189] It overflowed.
[time=2190] It abundantly overflows.
[time=2192] It hyper flows.
[time=2196] It overflows with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
[time=2202] The new living translation, it does a very good job there.
[time=2205] It says that he filled me with the faith and love that come from Christ Jesus.
[time=2210] He filled me with the faith and love that come from Christ, even Ephesians 2.
[time=2215] Even the faith to believe is a gift.
[time=2218] The love that I am able to show to people in my life now does not come from me.
[time=2225] It is a work of God.
[time=2227] The fruit of the spirit is, what's the first one?
[time=2230] Love, that's the first one.
[time=2232] It comes from him.
[time=2233] I can't conjure it up.
[time=2234] You can't conjure up those things, friends.
[time=2237] They are gifts that God gives you.
[time=2241] If you could conjure them up, you could take credit for it.
[time=2244] I was very loving today.
[time=2245] Pat yourself in the back, I was very joyful.
[time=2249] Nice job.
[time=2250] Have to have some ice cream.
[time=2252] But I thought, well, grace tells a different story.
[time=2259] Mercy.
[time=2260] Tolion Chavijian is the new pastor
[time=2266] of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Florida.
[time=2270] It's the place where D. James Kennedy was the pastor for many years.
[time=2273] You guys might know his name.
[time=2274] My grandfather was a huge fan.
[time=2276] And he says on his blog, his friend told a silly story about a man standing at the gates of heaven waiting to be admitted.
[time=2283] And I'll just let that illustrate my point.
[time=2285] To the man's utter shock, Peter said, you have to have earned a thousand points to be admitted to heaven.
[time=2291] What have you done to earn your points?
[time=2294] Never heard that before, but I think I'll do all right, he said.
[time=2297] I was raised in a Christian home and I've always been a part of the church.
[time=2300] I have Sunday school attending spins.
[time=2301] They go down to the floor, went to a Christian college, graduate school, probably led a hundred people to Christ.
[time=2308] I'm an elder by church.
[time=2309] I'm supportive of what the people of God do.
[time=2311] I have three kids, two boys and a girl.
[time=2313] My oldest boy is a pastor.
[time=2316] The younger is working with a mission that helps the poor, my daughter and her husband or missionaries, I've always tithed.
[time=2323] And now I'm giving over 30% of my income to the church.
[time=2326] I'm a bank executive and I work with the poor in our city trying to get low income mortgages.
[time=2332] How am I doing so far?
[time=2334] He said to Peter, "That's one point," Peter said.
[time=2336] "What else you got?" He said in frustration, "Good Lord, have mercy."
[time=2344] Peter said, "That's it.
[time=2347] Welcome home." Mercy.
[time=2350] Mercy is when I don't get what I deserve.
[time=2354] Grace is when I get what I don't deserve.
[time=2359] Simple definition.
[time=2360] Perfect patience friends is the next point in your outline, perfect patience.
[time=2367] I don't think that Paul could say it any more strongly than he does in verse 15.
[time=2372] Look at what he says in verse 15 in 1 Timothy 1.
[time=2376] The saying is trustworthy and deserving full acceptance.
[time=2381] You can't make a bigger deal than that.
[time=2384] The message translates it I think very effectively here.
[time=2387] The message says, "Here's a word you can take "to heart and depend on." That's what Paul means.
[time=2394] This needs to go with you out the door into your car, to your house, to your job tomorrow.
[time=2399] What's the trustworthy message?
[time=2402] That Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I, says Paul, and the foremost, I'm first in line.
[time=2410] The chief of sinners he calls himself.
[time=2413] That deserves full acceptance.
[time=2416] There's a man named Jesus who is the Messiah, who came from God into the world, to offer salvation, salvation from what?
[time=2426] We use that, I'm sure I've missed this to you guys before.
[time=2431] Saved only means something if I am saved from a thing.
[time=2436] When did you get saved?
[time=2439] Saved, saved from what?
[time=2441] I don't know, I needed salvation.
[time=2443] The Bible's perspective, the Bible's lenses that it uses, is that you need to be saved.
[time=2448] You are lost, and in need of salvation, and that you are a sinner.
[time=2454] Outside of Christ, that you are in need of salvation, because of the wages of your sin, Romans chapter six, is what?
[time=2461] Is death.
[time=2462] That's a biblical worldview that the world does not share.
[time=2465] Don't turn on the TV, just waiting to hear it.
[time=2470] Yeah, I'm a sinner.
[time=2471] I'm a bad person left to myself.
[time=2473] Yes, thank you.
[time=2475] They're gonna tell you that story.
[time=2478] I don't say that to be accusative at all.
[time=2481] I'm saying it to illustrate, there's still what the Bible says about you, and it doesn't just say that, friends, it says that Christ made a way.
[time=2489] He made a way.
[time=2491] He doesn't just say, "You're a sinner." Good luck with all that, again, and I'll go have my burrito.
[time=2497] The deepest need of humanity says Thomas Oden, this will be on the screen behind me.
[time=2504] The deepest need of humanity is salvation from sin.
[time=2509] It's not more education, it's not more money, it's not more opportunity.
[time=2514] Salvation from sin.
[time=2518] This is the quandary, the problem to which the gospel speaks.
[time=2521] The church that forgets the gospel of salvation is not the church, but it's echo.
[time=2526] It's powerful.
[time=2530] The church that becomes focused on maintaining itself and not the gospel becomes a dead branch of the living vine.
[time=2537] The church is imperiled when it becomes intoxicated with the spirit of its particular age committed more to serve the gods of that age than the God of all ages.
[time=2549] The deepest need that we have, friends, is salvation from sin and to tell that story again and again and again, to preach it to myself.
[time=2557] If I feel like I have, or my resume looks pretty good, I need to preach the gospel of myself.
[time=2563] Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, and I didn't deserve it.
[time=2566] I received grace and mercy.
[time=2568] They abounded, they overflowed.
[time=2570] Letter A here under Roman number two, perfect patience is a question, and the question is why were you saved?
[time=2580] I have a ticket over there on the pew I think it is next to Natasha that gives me permission to go get my daughter from Sunday school in a few minutes.
[time=2589] And so I think they let me anyway, but it's official.
[time=2594] I think this is right.
[time=2596] I'm thankful for that, aren't you?
[time=2597] I was not saved just so I could go to heaven.
[time=2602] Thank God I will.
[time=2604] [AMEN] And so will you.
[time=2607] I have an eternal destiny, the Quran talked about.
[time=2610] We sing that song.
[time=2612] You hold me now.
[time=2613] That will happen, no weeping, no suffering, no sorrow, no pain, no sick or lame, no ulcerative colitis.
[time=2622] No pneumonia, no malaria, no AIDS.
[time=2629] That will happen someday.
[time=2632] I'm gonna be in his presence forever, worshiping at his feet, there'll be no light.
[time=2636] He'll be the light forever.
[time=2638] Read Revelation 21 and 22 when you get home today and just let it give you warmth on a cold day.
[time=2647] That will happen.
[time=2650] I will be with him forever.
[time=2652] That is true, but it's not the only reason why I was saved.
[time=2655] There's a very small little phrase here, friends.
[time=2659] It's in verse 16.
[time=2660] It says I received mercy for this reason.
[time=2665] For what reason?
[time=2667] That in me as the foremost Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him as a prototype.
[time=2681] God saved you so that others would look at what he's done in your life and say, God is awesome.
[time=2689] God is awesome.
[time=2690] Not your awesome.
[time=2691] Your heaven one day will be awesome.
[time=2694] I wanna get away from this awful world.
[time=2696] Let's go there, but the God would put on display his perfect patience in Jesus.
[time=2701] That's why you were saved.
[time=2702] We're Brian's testimony is just that, putting God's infinite patience on display.
[time=2710] And we were joys in that, we ought to rejoice in that.
[time=2713] Friends, that's a one-handed view of salvation that I'm saved to get out of hell.
[time=2719] That hell is a real place.
[time=2721] And if it wasn't a real place, much of the book of Romans makes no sense.
[time=2725] It's a one-handed view for just from something.
[time=2731] I am saved to something as well, to what?
[time=2733] To make his perfect patience on display in my life day by day by day by day.
[time=2739] Let her be who saved you.
[time=2740] Let her be in your outline, who saved you?
[time=2746] This passage is a very awesome response to that question.
[time=2750] Here it is.
[time=2751] Verse 17, the king of ages, immortal, invisible,
[time=2758] the only God, that's who saved you.
[time=2764] And you can't arm wrestle him and win.
[time=2767] I know you saved me, God, but I'd rather not.
[time=2770] The king of ages, the king of the eons,
[time=2777] he saved you.
[time=2778] That's a great salvation.
[time=2782] God didn't, again, God isn't just kind of doling out salvation like, all right.
[time=2785] It's this extravagant salvation from an unbelievably unpowerful God.
[time=2791] Go back this week and read those prayers.
[time=2794] In 1 Timothy 6 and in 1 Chronicles 29, read those prayers this week as you have time.
[time=2800] And who is this God?
[time=2801] He's the only sovereign David praise.
[time=2804] He is the blessed forever.
[time=2807] Roman numeral three, as you wrap up, is the good fight.
[time=2812] The good fight.
[time=2816] Verse 18 of 1 Timothy 1 says, "This charge I entrust to you, "Timothy, my child, in accordance with the prophecies "previously made about you." Timothy is called Paul's child.
[time=2827] Again, there's a very affectionate, and also it reveals the fact that Paul had passed on, Paul had passed on the gospel of somebody else.
[time=2833] He has a spiritual family.
[time=2837] And so I would repeat Kelly's question to you.
[time=2839] Are you passing it along?
[time=2840] Do you have spiritual children?
[time=2842] Are you being miserly with a gift that God's given you?
[time=2847] Are you being like him, generous?
[time=2850] Is it on display and what you do?
[time=2851] And again, what you don't do?
[time=2852] It's a fair question.
[time=2853] The prophecies here, friends, it's the utterance of somebody who says what God says, who interprets divine will or purposes.
[time=2862] So someone saw Timothy's life and said, "Timothy, God's God has called in your life, serve him." They said it authoritatively.
[time=2871] Many people said this about Timothy.
[time=2873] They affirmed God's call in his life.
[time=2875] And so he says, because they were confident in you, Timothy, you can be confident.
[time=2879] Waged the good warfare, fight the good fight.
[time=2883] The new living says, "May they help you fight well "in the Lord's battles.
[time=2888] "God will always equip you to do the tasks "that he has called you to do." He will never say, again, go out there and fight it, go out there and fight and do the best you can.
[time=2902] That's not what he says.
[time=2905] If he calls us to waves the good warfare and to fight the good fight, he's gonna equip us with armor to do it, which he does, by the way, in Ephesians 6 and elsewhere.
[time=2913] There's two things to say here, friends.
[time=2918] Let us A and B in your notes and we'll conclude here.
[time=2922] Later, there are things worth fighting for.
[time=2925] These two men, Hymenaeus and Alexander, had shipwrecked their faith.
[time=2932] That verb for shipwreck means shipwreck.
[time=2935] It means that a great disaster had befallen them.
[time=2941] They weren't literally in a boat and they crashed.
[time=2944] It's used that way in Acts, only the other place it's used.
[time=2948] Their faith was made a disaster.
[time=2951] Their pretended faith, faith they claimed to have.
[time=2954] There are things worth fighting for.
[time=2958] Fighting for the truth is worth it.
[time=2961] First, 2 Corinthians 10 says, "Though we walk in the flesh, "we're not waging war according to the flesh.
[time=2967] "The weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, "but have divine power to destroy strongholds." Verse 5, 2 Corinthians 10, "We destroy arguments "and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God "and take every thought captive to obey Christ." Paul is really after these false teachers in Ephesus in chapter one, guys like Hymenaeus and Alexander who liked lofty opinions and not the gospel.
[time=2992] It's worth fighting for the truth.
[time=2998] That's worth fighting for it.
[time=3000] But your kids are getting false messages day after day from other sources in the Bible is worth fighting against their friends, don't grow weary and doing good.
[time=3010] Don't grow weary and doing good.
[time=3011] Fight the good fight.
[time=3013] Let her be 'cause the stakes are high.
[time=3017] What is at stake is people's eternal soul.
[time=3023] That's at stake.
[time=3026] Not a good life or a not so good life.
[time=3029] Their eternal destiny.
[time=3031] It says that these guys were delivered over to Satan.
[time=3036] They were handed over to Satan.
[time=3038] Two things I would say there by way of observation.
[time=3041] I think it probably means that they were set outside the church 'cause he has no dominion in this place.
[time=3047] [AMEN] Out there, he has dominion.
[time=3049] And here he doesn't.
[time=3051] Not literally in this place with us.
[time=3054] That's one thing I would say.
[time=3056] Second thing I would say is this.
[time=3057] Being in the church, being out of the church is serious business.
[time=3064] Fellowship.
[time=3066] To be cast outside of it was a means of discipline.
[time=3069] So if I'm here or not here matters to God.
[time=3072] Whether you're here or not here matters to him.
[time=3075] So much so, the Paul says the means of discipline to restore these lost people was to put them outside the church.
[time=3082] The congregation.
[time=3085] Being here friends, buying in is important.
[time=3090] Fellowship is important.
[time=3091] The stakes are high.
[time=3093] Help us, help us to equip you with those things by being here.
[time=3097] So we can't equip you to do the work of the ministry.
[time=3099] As Corbin and Natasha and Adam come, I'm so glad they're coming.
[time=3105] They're gonna sing a song for you.
[time=3108] The words will be on the screen.
[time=3110] This is the message over again.
[time=3112] I wanna encourage you today to rejoice in the overflowing grace and the perfect patience of God made manifest to us and the person of Jesus.
[time=3122] I wanna encourage you also to fight the good fight.
[time=3124] There are things worth fighting for and the truth of the gospel is worth fighting for.
[time=3132] The stakes are very, very high.
[time=3135] People's souls are at risk and the only way they can be saved is through Jesus.
[time=3139] There are not many ways to be saved.
[time=3142] Listen to these words friends, let it encourage you yet again.
[time=3146] Let the message be preached to you a second time.
[time=3148] God bless you as you listen.
