[time=175] Oh, you must increase, I must decrease, ooh Yeah, how 'bout down and you will be closer, you must increase, you must increase, I must decrease, ooh
[time=202] How 'bout town and you will be cut down?
[time=711] Let's sing this together. This is my prayer.
[time=715] This is my prayer in the desert.
[time=719] When all that's within me feels dry.
[time=724] This is my prayer in my hunger and need.
[time=728] My God is the God who provides.
[time=732] And this is my prayer in the fire.
[time=737] In weakness or trial or pain.
[time=741] There is a faith proved of more worth than gold.
[time=746] So refine me, Lord, through the flames.
[time=750] I will bring praise.
[time=756] No weapon formed against me shall remain.
[time=760] I will rejoice.
[time=762] I will declare.
[time=764] God is my victory and He is here.
[time=770] This is my prayer.
[time=776] This is my prayer in the battle.
[time=780] When triumph is still on its way.
[time=785] I am a hunger and poor and bright.
[time=789] So firm on its promise I'll stand.
[time=793] I will bring praise.
[time=797] No weapon formed against me shall remain.
[time=801] I will rejoice.
[time=803] I will declare.
[time=806] God is my victory and He is here.
[time=811] All of my life in every season.
[time=817] You are still God.
[time=820] I have a reason to sing.
[time=829] All of my life in every season.
[time=835] You are still God.
[time=837] I have a reason to sing.
[time=846] All of my life in every season.
[time=852] You are still God.
[time=854] I have a reason to sing.
[time=863] All of my life in every season.
[time=869] You are still God.
[time=872] I have a reason to sing.
[time=881] I will bring praise.
[time=886] No weapon formed against me shall remain.
[time=891] I will rejoice.
[time=893] I will declare.
[time=895] God is my victory and He is here.
[time=902] All we will do.
[time=904] You are here.
[time=908] This is my prayer in the harvest.
[time=920] When favor and providence form.
[time=925] I know I'm filled to be empty together.
[time=931] The seed I've received I will sow.
[time=939] Thank you Corbin and team.
[time=943] Thanks for leading us in worship and reminding us of the great truths that we get to celebrate and know as people who follow God. Amen.
[time=954] I'm joined this morning by the gentleman who was with you last week in my absence.
[time=960] I like to call him Dr. Steven Webster.
[time=964] You can welcome him again.
[time=968] He's not a doctor, but I just tell him he looks like one.
[time=973] And oftentimes sounds like one, but he's a good friend.
[time=977] Chairman of our Bible department here at Black Hawk Christian School, teaching pastor here at the church and truly a good friend and part of our team and I've so enjoyed.
[time=987] The friendship that God has given Steve and I so thankful for the team that we get to work with.
[time=992] Steve is, as we experienced yesterday, Steve is a Michigan man, and by that I mean U of M.
[time=1000] And I am these days an MSU guy, and we were together at the MSU U of M game in Ann Arbor, which did not go well.
[time=1010] From a certain perspective.
[time=1013] Yeah, right. But it's all right. We're going to keep at it, and Steve's dad, Larry, was with us.
[time=1019] We had a great day, and Todd Saul Frank. I took three U of M guys with me to the Michigan State U of M game.
[time=1025] So anyway, it was nice of me.
[time=1027] A lot of witnesses, you might say.
[time=1029] Right.
[time=1032] Anyway, we'll move on from meaningless discussion to that which is of great importance.
[time=1042] I grew up, many of you did too, as I'm looking around, I grew up in the 60s and 70s.
[time=1048] And as I grew up in the 60s and 70s, there were three channels.
[time=1053] Remember? ABC, CBS, NBC.
[time=1057] Three channels. There might have been a fourth that came in fuzzy, but there were three channels.
[time=1063] Wrap your arms around that. 20 somethings.
[time=1067] 30 somethings. There were three channels.
[time=1071] The guys that brought the news to us at night, there were three men that spoke news into American culture.
[time=1078] Harry Reasoner, John Chancellor, and Walter Cronkite.
[time=1083] Think about this. Three voices.
[time=1088] Three men that spoke and gave commentary on what was going on and what it was like and where it was happening.
[time=1096] And then as I got a little bit older, cable came.
[time=1101] And with cable, you know, and that day there, without there were 20 channels.
[time=1105] It was a huge deal if you had HBO.
[time=1109] And your parents knew what house you couldn't go to to spend the night anymore.
[time=1115] And then all of a sudden it all broke loose.
[time=1118] You know what I mean? I mean it just broke loose.
[time=1122] I have 300 channels at home on our system, which is just common every day.
[time=1128] You know, basic Verizon or Frontier, sorry, whatever they call it.
[time=1133] And then there's the Internet. Then there's the Internet.
[time=1136] And as three stations gave way to 20, which gave way to 300, which now with the Internet has given way to tens of millions
[time=1146] of voices and reports and blogs and Facebooks, Steve and I were curious today.
[time=1152] I said, "Hey, dude, we're singing." And I leaned over, I said, "Hey, dude, how many people are on Facebook?" And he goes, "I don't know." And he just gets his phone. It's just so today, right?
[time=1161] He gets his phone and I see him just going ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[time=1164] And we're singing and sorry. But we're on the net and...
[time=1167] Multitasking. Multitasking.
[time=1169] Ten seconds. And he looks at his phone and he leans over to me and he says, "300 million." There's 300 million people on Facebook.
[time=1177] And here's my point. We have come from a day where three men had a voice.
[time=1182] To a day where there are hundreds of millions of people who have a voice and the way culture has gone, everybody wants to speak.
[time=1190] Everybody wants to say something. Everybody wants to communicate.
[time=1194] And now even more so in recent days, I've noticed many of you have as well, that communication can get more and more negative.
[time=1202] That communication can get more and more critical.
[time=1205] That communication gets more and more, "I want to say what's wrong. I want to say what I don't like.
[time=1211] I want to say what's an injustice. I want to say to the whole world, everything that's wrong about him or her or them."
[time=1219] And the communication has just, you know, there's just millions and millions and millions of voices talking about what's wrong
[time=1229] and what's not right and what they don't like.
[time=1233] And Paul writes to Timothy in 1 Timothy chapter 2 about our posture and our voice toward government.
[time=1246] And let me just tell you before you read it, it's a little different than where we've come.
[time=1255] Would you, just in honor of God's word, would you stand and allow?
[time=1259] Steve and I here to let me just read this to you. First Timothy chapter 2 verses 1 through 6.
[time=1267] First of all then, Timothy, I urge that in treaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men for kings
[time=1279] and all who are in authority, prayers and treaties, petitions and thanksgivings for kings and all who are in authority
[time=1290] so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
[time=1298] This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth
[time=1308] for there is one God and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus who gave himself as a ransom for all
[time=1317] the testimony given at the proper time.
[time=1323] Pray with me, our Father in heaven, we come this morning into your presence so grateful for the privilege of doing so
[time=1330] and God admittedly today as we look at your design for the body, true church we've called this study,
[time=1337] or we as believers to posture ourselves and conduct ourselves toward those in authority in our life.
[time=1347] God this passage makes a specific reference to those who engage in leadership in civil authority,
[time=1356] those who rule over us in our world, our country, our state, our city.
[time=1363] Father, may you teach us today, may you remind us of the posture of your son.
[time=1369] May we see in him the kind of attitude and mindset that we should reflect toward those who govern.
[time=1376] God, may we from your words and your truth gain a better understanding of how it is you'd want us to conduct ourselves
[time=1383] in these days, in this world, on this front.
[time=1388] We ask all of this, we look forward to what you'll do with these requests in your son's name we pray.
[time=1394] Amen, you can have a seat.
[time=1396] What Stephen and I decided to do was simply kind of take the passage that I just read and we just set there for a while
[time=1403] and came up with four or five questions right from the text itself.
[time=1408] And our hope is that as we ask and then try to answer these questions you'll just get out your pins and you'll take some
[time=1414] notes and you'll make some, some note of some truths and you may have questions that come up.
[time=1420] We want you to ask those later.
[time=1422] We hope you'll engage in this discussion and we think it's extremely important for us today.
[time=1427] And I'm going to have Steve start us out with question number one.
[time=1430] Steve, what are in treaties?
[time=1432] He says there in verse one that we're to do this.
[time=1434] In treaties, prayers, petitions and thanksgivings for all men, for kings and those in authority.
[time=1443] Those four things.
[time=1445] Supplications or in treaties are specific requests being made of God for people.
[time=1454] Which I'm asking God to do this thing in someone's specific life.
[time=1461] Yes, it's an urgent request.
[time=1462] It's not like, you know, God has to get around to it.
[time=1464] It's sure to be nice.
[time=1465] It's an urgent request.
[time=1467] Intercessions come, it's a little bit different word, but this is an urgent request of God on somebody else's behalf.
[time=1474] It's only used in scripture to address God himself to meet needs.
[time=1479] I think it's interesting to use these four words, Kelly, but I think it's important for us to really spell out how do we do that?
[time=1488] In the digital age, they still have actual hard copy newspapers.
[time=1492] I think you can go get the hard copy newspapers.
[time=1494] Is that right?
[time=1496] You can read every newspaper in the world virtually to some extent online.
[time=1502] I just read Google news is my news feed, Google news button top of the page.
[time=1507] This gives me all the news stories from around the world at my fingertips.
[time=1512] Supplications implies that you know what needs to be praying for.
[time=1516] My encouragement to you today would be that you are engaged enough to know how to pray for your local,
[time=1523] your state, your federal leadership.
[time=1526] That's implied very much in the passage.
[time=1528] Supplications.
[time=1529] The next word in the passage is prayers.
[time=1531] That's a generic word for prayer.
[time=1532] The idea here, guys, is the Paul is getting all around it, the cumulative impact of prayer.
[time=1538] Supplications or entreaties, prayers.
[time=1540] The next word is intercessions.
[time=1543] It's only used twice in the whole New Testament, which means it's a forceful word.
[time=1547] When you use a word that rarely, you're getting a point across.
[time=1550] It's interesting, this word is used elsewhere in the ancient world outside the Bible as a word that you would use to address leaders,
[time=1557] how you would petition them for a redress of grievances as a constitution reads it,
[time=1563] but it would be a way to approach them in such a way.
[time=1567] Here it's used for people to make petitions of God the Father.
[time=1571] So it's very interesting how those things are folded together.
[time=1575] First of all, there's supplications or entreaties, prayers, intercessions.
[time=1581] The word to intercede means that I'm fending for somebody else.
[time=1585] I am fending for their needs on somebody else's behalf.
[time=1588] Would you please help these people?
[time=1590] I'm lobbying God.
[time=1592] In other words, I am seeking his favor for somebody else.
[time=1597] The last word is an extraordinary word because we'll talk about it here in a minute.
[time=1600] The word is thanksgivings.
[time=1602] And I am impressed, friends, that out of 1 Timothy 1, where we were yesterday last week,
[time=1608] that the overflowing grace of God, the perfect patience of Christ to fight the good fight, those things that we talked about last week, the first thing he says in the next chapter, first of all then, first thing to do is to pray for all people in this manner.
[time=1625] That's striking to me.
[time=1626] That's his first aim is to pray for all people and particularly a certain kind of people that Kelly will tell you about now.
[time=1633] But the last word he uses is thanksgivings.
[time=1636] That's I think very instructive.
[time=1639] In treaties, prayers, petitions, and thanksgivings, don't miss that last line of verse 1 on behalf
[time=1646] of how many men?
[time=1647] On behalf of all men, church, we are to be characterized by hearts that would have as
[time=1653] our desire to pray for all men.
[time=1657] A lot of ways we can do that.
[time=1659] I know it sounds like a steep task, but that's the heart of God on this, that we would be willing to pray for along those lines, those four things, all men.
[time=1669] Then he gets into kings and those who are in authority.
[time=1673] Question two, hope you'll write this down.
[time=1675] What's the significance for the reader?
[time=1678] The reader meeting those who were at this church in Ephesus.
[time=1682] As they hurt Paul's words through Timothy onto them, what's the significance for the reader
[time=1688] and for us of the command to pray for kings and those in authority?
[time=1695] You see it right there at the beginning of verse 2 for kings and those in authority.
[time=1701] All right, first of all, what's the significance?
[time=1704] First of all, the fact was then, and it's true still today, that because so many powerful
[time=1711] and influential rulers are typically hostile to God and the principles of God, they often
[time=1717] become the targets.
[time=1719] These kings and those in authority, they often become the targets of the people's bitterness,
[time=1725] criticism, and outright animosity.
[time=1728] People who want it a different way.
[time=1731] And in many cases, those who do have an allegiance to God, who don't agree with how they're doing
[time=1738] what they're doing, they don't like what it looks like, they don't like what it entails, and they get bitter, they get critical, and they get outright hateful in the way they respond to it.
[time=1752] Interesting, Steve and I were talking about this and reading the passage and studying together.
[time=1758] You know, it strikes us that he wants us to pray.
[time=1765] There's no bitterness, there's no criticism, there's no animosity.
[time=1770] And as we read and study it, we realize, wait a minute, we're always telling you, always look at the context, who's he writing to, where are they?
[time=1780] And he's writing to people in Ephesus who would have in that day, my friends, been under Roman rule.
[time=1787] And Roman rule in that day was a guy named, anybody know?
[time=1793] Nero.
[time=1797] And Nero would have been, Nero would have been the most ungodly, most brutal, most murderous,
[time=1807] treacherous, tortuous, inhumane, sick, detestable, hateful person that's ever walked the face of the earth.
[time=1820] The stuff that he did, the way that he lived, the absolute abhorrence that lived within him
[time=1828] for the faith and those who followed Christ, it was absolutely unconscionable.
[time=1834] History tells us this.
[time=1838] And this is who's in charge.
[time=1843] This is who's in the White House, if you will.
[time=1847] And he says, pray for him.
[time=1851] Pray humbly for him, ask God to help them, don't tear them down, petition God to build them up.
[time=1860] Pray that they would repent, pray that they would have truth, God's truth revealed to them.
[time=1867] And secondly, Stephen, I want you to see this, it's very related to that.
[time=1871] We want you to see that this passage and Paul's instruction to Timothy, that the church should be as it relates to those in government
[time=1879] and places of authority, that we should be humble and that we should be prayerful.
[time=1884] We want you to see how this really does bring into view a great theological principle that really should govern our lives.
[time=1893] And that is the principle of the sovereignty of God.
[time=1897] It is the sovereignty, big word, which means God's rule and God's reign over everything.
[time=1904] You understand this, right?
[time=1905] There is no mistake in this world.
[time=1907] There is no oversight in your life, what goes on, what transpires, what we see out there.
[time=1913] God is sovereignly, providentially over.
[time=1919] And so when we come to this issue of those who govern and those who lead, it's important that you and I biblically understand
[time=1926] how we should even just, first of all, before we respond, we have to figure out how biblically we take it in.
[time=1932] And I want to help you with that, look in your Bibles if you would to Daniel chapter 2.
[time=1936] Everybody turn there.
[time=1937] Would you go to Daniel chapter 2?
[time=1941] It says, and I want you to see this, here Daniel basically throughout the book of Daniel, if it's not Darius, it's Nebuchadnezzar,
[time=1948] but we see Daniel and the boys dealing with a couple of different rulers, both of which were at some point in time
[time=1956] completely hostile toward God and the things of God.
[time=1959] But we see here in Daniel 2, 19.
[time=1963] You see it there, Daniel 2, 19.
[time=1967] It says, then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a night vision.
[time=1973] And then Daniel blessed the God of Heaven.
[time=1976] Daniel said, "Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever.
[time=1980] For wisdom and power belong to him.
[time=1983] It is he who changes the times and epochs.
[time=1987] He removes kings and establishes kings.
[time=1991] He gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to men of understanding."
[time=1997] Steve, would you read Daniel 4, 17?
[time=2000] Listen, as Steve reads this to you, "The sovereignty of God, his rule and his reign being that which governs all"
[time=2008] coming into view here, 4, 17.
[time=2012] "The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, the decision by the word of the holy ones,
[time=2018] that to the end of the living may know that the most high rules, the kingdom of men,
[time=2024] and gives it to whom he will and sets over it the loneliest of men." And then let me read 4.32 to you, turning your Bibles to 4.32.
[time=2034] It says there, this is him dealing with Nebuchadnezzar, here was a king on the earth who didn't want to go by God's rules
[time=2041] and eventually God deals with him, turns him into a beast.
[time=2044] And it says in 4.32, and you, Nebuchadnezzar, you will be driven away from mankind
[time=2050] and your dwelling place will be with the beasts of the field.
[time=2055] You will be given grass to eat like cattle and seven periods of time will pass over you
[time=2061] until you recognize, listen, until you recognize that the most high is ruler over the realm of mankind
[time=2069] and bestows it authority on whomever he wishes.
[time=2076] Go to Romans 13, go back to your New Testament real quick.
[time=2080] Go to Romans 13 verses 1 and 2, maybe the classic New Testament passage on the sovereignty
[time=2088] and providence of God as it relates to those in authority over us, especially in the governmental discussion.
[time=2094] Romans 13, 1, every person, you see it?
[time=2099] Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities.
[time=2105] For there is no authority except from who?
[time=2108] Say it, church.
[time=2109] God.
[time=2110] And those which exist in authority are established by who?
[time=2115] Say it, church.
[time=2116] Therefore, whoever resists authority.
[time=2121] Think about this, okay?
[time=2123] Think about this.
[time=2125] Think about how you come at this.
[time=2128] Think about how you watch others come at this.
[time=2130] Think about the voices we hear today who come at this thing.
[time=2134] Think about the attitude that we sense and see as people come at this whole response to authority.
[time=2140] Whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God.
[time=2146] And they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.
[time=2153] Here's the point.
[time=2154] We've got to keep going here.
[time=2155] Here's the point.
[time=2156] God says, whoever you are, wherever you live, your dictator, your president, your prime minister,
[time=2167] your governor, your congressman, your mayor, the guy that runs your homeowners association
[time=2178] for goodness sake, your boss, anybody in the world who has a place of authority, guess
[time=2188] what?
[time=2189] It got given to him or her.
[time=2193] He or she, whoever is in charge, God says, remember, they are in charge because I allowed
[time=2199] it for my purposes.
[time=2202] Wow.
[time=2204] And you say, and I say, well, wait a minute, how could Nero have been about the purposes
[time=2212] of God?
[time=2223] I don't know.
[time=2225] I mean, yeah, I'm not sure how that works.
[time=2229] I've seen God do unspeakable things through tragedy.
[time=2234] I have seen that.
[time=2236] I have seen God do unimaginable things through seemingly heartless heartbreak.
[time=2241] Through situations that just made no human sense.
[time=2246] But the fact is it's right here.
[time=2248] He put them in place.
[time=2251] And they're only there because God willed it.
[time=2255] Now it goes on to say that you're to pray for them, this posture of humility.
[time=2262] And then it says there's a kind of life that comes with that.
[time=2265] Steve, I want Steve to talk to you about that, how that's to lead, how that leads to a peaceful and tranquil life.
[time=2272] Watch.
[time=2273] Okay.
[time=2274] Go.
[time=2275] I was struck, Kelly, all those words we just sang a minute ago, all of my life in every season.
[time=2281] You are still God.
[time=2283] I have a reason to sing in the harvest and the fire.
[time=2287] Either we mean it or we don't, you know, I don't know how to do that any other way.
[time=2292] We have to be serious about it, whether the guy we voted for, the guy we didn't vote for, either we mean it or we don't.
[time=2297] I think there's a real credibility issue there.
[time=2300] Verse 2 of 1 Timothy 2 says, "For kings and all who are in authority, these prayers should
[time=2307] be made." And those very important two words in the Miller friends and the words are so that in the NAS.
[time=2313] If you are inclined to mark in your Bibles, I would encourage you on that score.
[time=2317] So that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
[time=2326] We make prayers for those who are in kings and in authority over us for the purpose.
[time=2333] There's a connection between my way of life and whether I do or whether I don't.
[time=2338] In the same way that in the first Timothy 1, I have been saved to put the perfect patience
[time=2344] of Christ on display.
[time=2346] I make prayers for those for whom I disagree that I'm my peaceful and quiet and tranquil
[time=2355] and dignified life is at risk if I don't do that.
[time=2360] That is the place.
[time=2361] The setting.
[time=2362] Paul's not talking here about a Christian life, it's without difficulty.
[time=2367] He's talking about the setting in which God gets the most glory.
[time=2373] If there is a picture of a politician on your desk, friends, everybody knows you disagree with that person's positions on some really key issues, and they knew that you prayed for them, not a snarky, sarcastic kind of prayer, God be with them.
[time=2387] That's what Pharisees did.
[time=2390] Thank you, God.
[time=2391] I'm like that tax collector over there.
[time=2395] It's really hard to be angry with someone that you're praying for.
[time=2398] I wrote that in my Bible years and years ago, it's totally true.
[time=2404] If people knew in your life that you honestly, sincerely, genuinely prayed for people in your life with whom you profoundly disagree, the gospel gets a greater hearing.
[time=2414] A godly and dignified life in every way, it says.
[time=2418] And friends, I think we need to be honest and say that on that score, we have some work to do.
[time=2424] It would be dishonest to say anything otherwise.
[time=2426] We need to consider the example of Jesus here.
[time=2430] In the face of authorities who beat him to a pulp, his posture was quiet, his posture
[time=2438] was humble, he was willing to be misunderstood to frightening levels, it's compelling friends.
[time=2446] It's decidedly unchristian to hate your enemies.
[time=2451] It subverts the gospel, and subverts means it works against it.
[time=2456] In Matthew chapter 5, if you have your Bibles, go to Matthew 5, just quickly, again.
[time=2463] This is the way of, this is what Jesus says.
[time=2466] You have heard that it was said, this is Matthew 5, 43, you've heard that it was said, love your neighbor and hate your enemy, but I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those
[time=2479] who persecute you so that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven.
[time=2485] He makes the sunrise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.
[time=2489] If you love those who love you, what reward do you have?
[time=2493] Don't even the tax collectors do the same.
[time=2495] If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others?
[time=2498] Don't even Gentiles do the same.
[time=2502] There is no wiggle room in those verses, friends.
[time=2505] I say that respectfully to you.
[time=2507] Well, I should love them unless they really start messing with me.
[time=2511] I don't see that.
[time=2514] The first century Christians and their submission posture to horrific authorities paid a heavy
[time=2520] price.
[time=2521] Kelly mentioned Nero earlier in the Roman historian named Tacitus wrote this about the Christian suffering.
[time=2526] I'll say it quickly to you.
[time=2527] A Christian historian or just historian?
[time=2530] Roman historian.
[time=2531] Yeah.
[time=2532] He talks about Christians from a distance, observing their own plight, so his credibility is not in question there.
[time=2537] He's not cooking it up.
[time=2539] Nero, of course, burned Rome to the ground and blamed Christians for it.
[time=2543] It's a famous story.
[time=2545] Tacitus, his mockery of every sort, was add to their deaths, covered with the skins of beasts.
[time=2549] They were torn by dogs in Paris or nailed to crosses or doomed to the flames and burnt to serve as a nightly illumination when daylight had expired.
[time=2559] The picture there is that Nero had garden parties and the Christians were burned alive as torches to illuminate his parties.
[time=2568] Kicked his wife to death.
[time=2569] Kicked his pregnant wife to death at one point.
[time=2570] Kicked his pregnant wife.
[time=2571] There's so many other things to say about him that do not deserve to be repeated.
[time=2574] The man was the worst of men.
[time=2578] And Paul says, "When you pray for someone in that way," and that prayer is like a Nero, a sneering prayer, but authentic, genuine prayers.
[time=2587] I'll just remind you, friends, from last week that no one is beyond the reach of God.
[time=2592] No one in an I.S. in Damascus receives Paul, who is breathing out murderous threats against
[time=2601] the church.
[time=2602] And he kind of says, "God, are you sure if you get the right guy?" This is the guy that was putting my friends in jail.
[time=2610] The desires of God are on display in this passage, friends.
[time=2612] I would respectfully submit it to you.
[time=2615] If you pray as though some people are beyond the reach of God, then we're at risk of a grave misunderstanding.
[time=2621] And I think Stephen and I both think it's very important to remind all people, but we think it's really important to remind the church today.
[time=2629] Because for some reason, the church can, it seems, get easily lumped into this political
[time=2636] discussion and those who are on the right, if you will.
[time=2640] And we do want to just remind you that there may be, as is the case with Stephen and I,
[time=2647] as we look at some things today, there are policies and there may be treaties and there may be platforms that we absolutely disagree with, absolutely, adamantly disagree with.
[time=2662] But we want to remind the church this morning that there is no biblical foundation at all
[time=2670] for the vocal vilification and attitudinal hatred voiced toward those in authority that
[time=2678] we see going on today on so many fronts in the name of what's right and what we believe.
[time=2689] Certainly no biblical foundation at all for the vilification and hatred voiced toward
[time=2696] those in authority.
[time=2699] And it's something that you and I have to be reminded of and Paul does a great job of reminding us of that right here in our passage today.
[time=2707] Question three, it gets really interesting here.
[time=2710] Steve, read question three form and let's talk about it.
[time=2713] What are your desires for your enemies, political opponents and those far from God?
[time=2718] I would just say with, so this, in verse three, Paul says, this is good and pleasing in the
[time=2724] sight of God our Savior to pray in this way for those in authority.
[time=2729] It is good and pleasing in his sight.
[time=2734] And I want to be in that place.
[time=2737] I want my life and we want our lives together, do we not, to be good and pleasing in his
[time=2743] sight.
[time=2745] It's not unclear what's good and pleasing to him.
[time=2748] And so it would be strange at a few levels to not pursue a course of action and attitude
[time=2755] that God says, do this.
[time=2757] The gospel deserves a hearing and it is threatened in some way friends when we don't live godly
[time=2764] dignified quiet, tranquil, tranquil, I can say it, lives.
[time=2770] 1 Thessalonians 4 comes to mind, just that reference down friends, 1 Thessalonians 4 starting in verse 9, reading through verse 12, just quickly, 1 Thessalonians 4, 9 through 12, it
[time=2781] says, now concerning brotherly love, you have no need for anyone to write to you.
[time=2787] That's interesting, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.
[time=2793] For that indeed is what you are doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia.
[time=2796] We urge you brothers to do this more and more into aspire to live quietly and to mind your
[time=2803] own affairs, to work with your hands as we instructed you so that you may walk properly
[time=2809] before outsiders.
[time=2812] We have an audience and they are watching what we do and what we don't do.
[time=2817] I will be very careful friends about your life being defined by what you don't do.
[time=2825] A reactive life is not a life that Christ calls us to.
[time=2829] There are things He calls us from, don't get me wrong, but a proactive life is a life that holds forth.
[time=2836] The main thing is to keep the main thing, the main thing, and that's our encouragement to you on that score.
[time=2842] Verse 4 says, He desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth,
[time=2850] saved and the knowledge of the truth, a desire for all men.
[time=2853] I like what you said first hour.
[time=2855] Say that again.
[time=2856] Thanks for reminding me.
[time=2857] Yeah, you're welcome.
[time=2859] There are probably some students of mine in the room today.
[time=2861] I want all my students to get a's on their tests.
[time=2864] What's my desire?
[time=2866] I thought that would be a source of peace for parents.
[time=2869] I want everyone to get a's on my tests.
[time=2872] They don't always get a's.
[time=2873] That's God's desire.
[time=2875] Do my desires for those far from God line up with God's desires or would I rather have
[time=2882] them be wrong so I can be made to look to be right, but rather win the argument or see
[time=2892] their soul saved.
[time=2893] Friend, that's a really, really important question to ask myself day by day.
[time=2896] Would I rather be right than see my lost friend come to know Christ, the lost person in my life with whom I just don't like.
[time=2903] I'll see the world the way that he does or she does.
[time=2907] God's desire is that that person be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth.
[time=2911] Is that my desire?
[time=2913] Saving and knowledge of the truth are the same thing.
[time=2916] This is God's heart.
[time=2918] Do we have the heart of God for those in our lives who are far from him or don't we?
[time=2922] There's not probably a long list of answers to that question.
[time=2926] Question number four.
[time=2927] Okay.
[time=2928] Do you hear this?
[time=2929] Just a few more here.
[time=2930] What about verses five and six?
[time=2932] Hope you'll write these down.
[time=2933] What about verses five and six actually are so vitally important for Christians today as they live under and respond to those in government.
[time=2943] What about five and six is so vitally important?
[time=2947] Five, for there is one God and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus
[time=2953] who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper time.
[time=2959] Here's what's so vitally important.
[time=2962] If you go back to the beginning of the passage, we started this discussion talking about basically
[time=2968] politics.
[time=2969] We started talking to you about praying for those in authority.
[time=2972] We started talking about presidents and governors and mayors.
[time=2976] And there's a lot of us in the room who's as soon as we started talking about, you're going, yeah, this is going to be cool.
[time=2981] We're going to talk about politics because this is about politics.
[time=2985] Well, in three verses, it quickly becomes clear if you've been reading with us that
[time=2992] verse one and two had a little bit of that in there, but now as the passage develops,
[time=2999] all of a sudden he's not talking about politics anymore.
[time=3003] Now he's talking about what should always be talked about, what is at the foundation of all things that should be important to you and me.
[time=3011] If you haven't noticed as the passage as progressed, he's talking more and more about salvation.
[time=3017] He's talking more and more about the gospel.
[time=3021] Verse five and six is a rendition of the gospel.
[time=3026] And so in this political discussion, in this dialogue about our posture toward those in
[time=3032] authority, especially those we disagree with, when we talk about how you're going to respond
[time=3039] and the prayer that you're going to have, Stephen and I want to ask you as we come to question four, what is your in this discussion, what should be your highest priority?
[time=3051] What should be your greatest commitment?
[time=3054] And there are those of us in the room who want to talk big government and small government.
[time=3059] We get into this and we want to talk about the right candidate and the right party.
[time=3064] We get into this and we want to talk about the ramifications of certain treaties and we get all riled up because we have all these opinions and thoughts and hear us.
[time=3072] We're not saying those are evil, we're saying, wait a minute, don't forget the main thing.
[time=3076] The main thing is the gospel needs a hearing.
[time=3080] And the gospel won't get a hearing unless you do this right.
[time=3084] And to do it with hatred and animosity and bitterness, the gospel never gets heard.
[time=3090] And what is at the foundation of this and what should be your greatest and most important priority is the salvation of souls far from God.
[time=3099] All men and those who rule.
[time=3102] Amen?
[time=3103] Does that make sense?
[time=3106] What's so vitally important for Christians today as they live under and respond to those in government, remember the gospel.
[time=3116] Remember the gospel.
[time=3117] The gospel gets a hearing in the midst of peaceful tranquil attitudes.
[time=3121] The gospel gets absolutely drowned out in the no-spin zone, if you will.
[time=3129] It gets drowned out if that's how we're going to do it.
[time=3132] If we're going to fight and we're going to argue and we're going to debate, we're going to make light of, it gets drowned out.
[time=3139] It gets heard and it gets seen when you and I approached this whole political arena in the way of Jesus who was humble and teachable.
[time=3148] He paid his tax, he got misunderstood, spoke the truth, got killed.
[time=3157] Question five, we've got to go.
[time=3160] Quickly, can I be passionate about politics and remain obedient to the word of God?
[time=3164] The answer is yes.
[time=3167] Future generations said Francis Shafer about 30 years ago need neither enshrined or neglect
[time=3175] politics.
[time=3177] There is a mistake to be made with making politics the end all.
[time=3180] The answer is more this, more education, more money, the ultimate answer in life is not
[time=3186] any of those things.
[time=3188] The ultimate answer in life is Jesus Christ.
[time=3190] Came into the world to save sinners for Timothy chapter one.
[time=3195] I have three questions to ask you on my way out.
[time=3197] Do you desire all men to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth?
[time=3201] Do you believe there is anything more important than that, this goes to answer this question, it is there an imbalance in your priorities?
[time=3210] What is the flag that is flying in your life most predominantly?
[time=3217] There's not a whole host of things that you and I talk about most often.
[time=3223] Is it a mystery to you?
[time=3224] What's most important?
[time=3225] I don't think that it is to people that really know you well.
[time=3227] How are you geared?
[time=3229] What are you talking about?
[time=3230] There is one thing that people would say, I know what they're about.
[time=3234] What is that?
[time=3236] Is it overspending in our government?
[time=3241] Is it the misgivings you have about that or is it the gospel of Jesus Christ?
[time=3245] Friends, we are not saying that those conversations are not important, far from it.
[time=3250] They're crucially important, but they're subordinate.
[time=3254] They are less important than the presentation of the gospel.
[time=3258] In God's desires for all people is their salvation and I would be hard pressed to dance around
[time=3265] the things that he says in this passage.
[time=3267] I don't want to.
[time=3268] I don't think any of us should want to do that, but we encourage you with those things.
[time=3272] It's hard to confess I may have idols in my life that are interfering with my proper
[time=3278] obedience to God's Word.
[time=3279] It's hard to admit that.
[time=3281] It's a bad reaction from me.
[time=3283] We would respectfully encourage you to read this passage carefully and let the Holy Spirit do the job that we can't do.
[time=3290] He does a very good job of it.
[time=3291] But the Holy Spirit prompt you to react in a way that he would have you to react.
[time=3296] [AMEN] Would you all stand and let me just leave you with this.
[time=3301] Steve and I talked about this first hour.
[time=3304] Let me just share it with you and we'll just a reiteration of what we've been saying.
[time=3309] But it is a subtle evil that I think slips into our thinking and our living.
[time=3315] The subtle evil that slips in is that this life of ours is about our right to pursue
[time=3322] life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[time=3329] We like the way that sounds and we've been taught that since we were little and it's what this country was founded on and I understand that.
[time=3336] But as followers of Jesus Christ, we have to understand that when you whittle that down,
[time=3342] life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that oftentimes means that we become a people who are about safety and security and retirement.
[time=3354] And that is patently not what we're about.
[time=3359] As followers of Christ and radicals for a cause that he has called us to bring to this
[time=3367] world of freedom and hope found in the forgiveness and grace of Jesus Christ, we are not about
[time=3373] those things.
[time=3374] We are about the gospel and we can be about it in a way that is powerful, but we can be
[time=3380] about it in a way that is gracious and kind and thoughtful.
[time=3385] And I would just encourage us, all of us, young and old, to be about it and to be about it in that fashion.
[time=3392] Let's pray.
[time=3393] Father, as we leave today, may we be reminded of what you've given us the privilege of speaking
[time=3399] about this morning and God, that is your providence and your sovereignty.
[time=3402] We walk through these doors now today into a world that looks a bit chaotic, but God,
[time=3408] it is not in your eyes.
[time=3410] It isn't out of control.
[time=3411] There aren't mistakes being made.
[time=3414] There aren't things that surprise you, all of it God, ordained by you and meant for us
[time=3421] to be able to, as we follow you, grow from and become stronger because of what you've
[time=3427] allowed.
[time=3428] God, I pray that as we look to those who lead in our city, in our state, in our country, I pray, God, that there would be, as Steve mentioned, genuine heartfelt prayers for
[time=3439] those.
[time=3440] God, it is a difficult task filled with things we are unaware of and we pray, God, that we
[time=3446] could support them in ways that would honor you and make much of you.
[time=3451] As we do that, God, we pray the gospel would have a hearing.
[time=3454] As we do that, God, we pray that we could talk about why it's so important that we do that.
[time=3460] And God, go before us, go before our prayers and go before our conversations.
[time=3464] May we be a people who are ready to communicate the great truth of your Son.
[time=3469] Paul said it was the only thing he cared about in 1 Corinthians 1.
[time=3472] God said it was the only thing he was mindful of.
