[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - And I wanna just tell you what a joy it is today, both first hour and second hour, to be in these waters with those who come to declare and proclaim that very thing.
[time=41] Their readiness and their willingness to follow Jesus.
[time=45] And I wanna introduce to you Stan Griswold.
[time=49] Stan's coming this morning with his dad, whose name is Stan as well, and his grandfather, Pastor Carmichael.
[time=56] And it's a real, come on in, guys.
[time=58] It's a real honor for me, and I mean that, to be able to share in these moments.
[time=65] - Yeah, sir.
[time=66] - And especially to be able to experience this with a family, in essence, scoot in here.
[time=73] Stan, and this is Stan, and this is Stan, and this is Pastor Carmichael.
[time=78] And this is a real privilege for us, church.
[time=82] Every time we get to hear a story of God redeeming and transforming, it is a privilege.
[time=87] And I hope you'll be encouraged, and I hope you'll celebrate with me as well, when we're done.
[time=92] Stan has got a story he wants to read you, so Stan, step on up there to the mic and tell him what you got there.
[time=97] - All right, my name is Stan Griswold.
[time=100] I am 28 years old.
[time=103] I'm married to Lisa Griswold.
[time=105] I'm the son of Stan and Monique Griswold, and the brother of Michelle Griswold.
[time=111] And I'm thankful to be a part of this body of believers and share my testimony with you today.
[time=117] I was blessed to be born into a family of believers in Christ, not only, you know, my immediate family, but also my grandparents, my aunts and uncles and cousins.
[time=129] God wasn't gonna give me any excuses for not knowing about him or how I should live my life.
[time=134] I accepted to believe Jesus Christ as my savior at a young age.
[time=140] I believe that it was at a vacation Bible school in Michigan with my cousins.
[time=145] And, you know, I assure you at a young age in the months to come, I'd double and triple check to make sure that he had come into my heart like I had asked him to.
[time=154] I have a memory of praying with my father at night and asking him, you know, if he came in when I asked him to.
[time=161] Having faith in Jesus and knowing the truth was never the problem for me growing up.
[time=167] I was also blessed to be brought up in this church and in this school, I can remember sitting over there as a little boy with my mom and dad, watching, you know, sitting and watching the baptism.
[time=184] My father's favorite way of keeping me busy is a little boy.
[time=189] He'd always show me how to twiddle my thumbs and I'd always try to raise him and go as fast as he could.
[time=194] And I remember telling my dad after seeing someone
[time=200] being baptized as a young boy that I'd wanted to do that.
[time=202] And my dad had told me, you know, after he said, Stan, when you can sit down and write a full page on why you'd like to be baptized and what it means to you, then I'll let you do it.
[time=211] But by the time that I was old enough to do what my father had asked, I was already preoccupied by all the distractions of growing up, you know, friends and sports and just the flood of all that there is growing up.
[time=225] And as I grew up, probably somewhere around fifth or sixth grade, Satan sold me a simple lie that started leading me away from the man that God wanted me to be.
[time=237] I wanted to be cool.
[time=239] And beginning around fifth grade, throughout high school, I put a lot of energy into being cool.
[time=244] And I looked to all the things that the world puts out there to define myself and set myself apart.
[time=250] You know, music and movies.
[time=251] This pursuit grew into a very selfish view of how I thought the world worked.
[time=257] And somewhere in high school, the things that I looked towards to be cool encouraged me to allow addictions to become part of my life.
[time=265] And at that point, at the point that I graduated high school, life was about all how life could please me and you know, not what I could offer to it.
[time=274] Like kind of like the story of the prodigal son, I took my inheritance, what I'll call everything that God had given me and instilled in me.
[time=282] At that point, my education, my opportunity, God had provided for me.
[time=287] And I put it towards pursuing my selfish desires and the false truths that I had bought into.
[time=293] And at the age of 22, I was blessed with an amazing woman, my wife Lisa.
[time=298] God also blessed us later with three children.
[time=301] And now once out of my parents' house, I had stopped going to church and I started a career in concrete construction and I was in pursuit of the good life with me at the center of it.
[time=312] I thought that my most important duty for my family was to provide the most money that I possibly could.
[time=319] And I thought that I needed to be able to provide the same opportunity that my parents had given me and I let my ambition for that goal forsake my priorities to my wife and my children.
[time=330] I ended up working out of town for weeks at a time and here out of town, there was a loneliness and a hole in my life without my loved ones.
[time=339] And here my addictions and pursuits of pleasure that I was introduced to when I was younger had a place to take hold in my life and Satan was just given a fine opportunity to take me to town.
[time=350] Being ashamed of the things that I took hold of, I hit 'em and I began to lie to loved ones, causing a lot of pain and a lot of mistrust.
[time=360] The man that I had become was far from that soft hearted child who had asked his father many years ago if he could be baptized.
[time=369] I had caused my strong wife a lot of pain and suffering with my lies and my backwards priorities and addictions and they became more important to me than my wife and my children at this point.
[time=382] But God promising to complete the work that he had started in me years ago, he began to shake up my life.
[time=390] He took away my job and that I had drive so much self-worth from and put so many hours a week into.
[time=397] He took it away leaving me with just not much to feel good about myself.
[time=401] And here God really began an earthquake in my life that would force me to confront my addictions, my idols, the things that were standing in the way of being the man that got it intended me to be.
[time=413] And at this point in my life, my marriage was in shambles.
[time=416] I had abused my wife's trust many, many, many times and I had put much before our relationship and she had talked about leaving which just broke my heart.
[time=428] Because inside I was still that soft hearted man that she had met our junior high school and my selfishness had consumed me and didn't allow me to see all the pain that I had been causing her.
[time=441] And I believe that God had took his hand to protection from me, you know, whatever blessing or closeness that he keeps to those who are his, he removed it and he allowed Satan to just kind of torment me.
[time=454] At this point, my failures in life began to pile up and just become a weight that was too heavy for me to carry.
[time=463] But all the lies that Satan had sold me
[time=470] and all the chains that he had wrapped around me slowly over time by the choices that I had made, God was determined to break me free.
[time=478] And one night I was alone woodworking in my garage when my strength had just broken down.
[time=484] I had fell down on my knees, literally fell down and cried out to God to just have mercy and put my life back together.
[time=491] I was finally willing to completely turn away from all the things that I had let take hold of my life for entirely too long.
[time=499] That night was about two years ago.
[time=503] And since then, God has fully restored my life through encouragement and direction from my family, a faithful effort to be at church each Sunday, spending time in God's word, self-reflection, confession and prayer.
[time=518] God came alongside me and showed me how real time his response can be to a man who chooses to fully turn away from the life of sin and selfish pursuits and choose to strive just to be obedient.
[time=533] Now, here I also saw that the man that I needed to be
[time=541] for my, the man in my father that I needed to be was the man who was faithful in bringing his family
[time=552] to church each Sunday and just that and striving to be obedient to the word of God.
[time=557] Now, through all that God had allowed me to go through, he really planted a strong love for those who are lost and those who can also be led astray.
[time=567] The kind of love that gives one the courage to go outside of my comfort zone and be a willing vessel to share the love of Christ.
[time=575] In preparation with this last week with Steve Longbraken and Arlen Friesen, Steve had asked me if I could remember the point that I had started walking with Jesus.
[time=586] And as I said earlier, faith is never the problem for me.
[time=592] I told him, Steve, that I remembered in middle school being frustrated about being on fire for God for a bit and then not, and then I realized last Sunday, last Sunday morning that on those youth group trips, I had confessed sin to leaders.
[time=608] I had cried, broken, and willing to make an effort to turn away from the sins that I had trouble with.
[time=615] But then once back home into the daily grind of life, the sins crept back in and they went unconfessed and unchallenged for long periods of time.
[time=623] I believe here I was walking with Christ, but he was doing a lot of looking back, waiting on me.
[time=629] This is where I realized that when I really began to walk
[time=635] with Christ, you know, at a bit of a pace, as an adult I put into practice, the examining of myself, confessing my sins and again and again making an effort to walk away from the sinful desires of my heart.
[time=651] Daily with consistency and adding to this daily prayer and time in God's words as tools to fight my human nature.
[time=659] So that's my story and I'm in front of you, congregation today out of obedience, publicly declaring my love for Christ.
[time=670] (audience applauding) Amen, I'm done.
[time=683] Before I have Pastor Carmichael pray for his grandson, I wanna just say this, I wanna say that I know because I just understand the dynamics of a room this size with this many people.
[time=695] I know that there are young men or even young women who are in this room right now and you're one of a couple of places you identify with Stan's story because you are wandering.
[time=711] You're gripped by your sin and you're a rebellion and life isn't at all.
[time=717] What you know God designed it to be and you're not at all where you know he wants you.
[time=723] And there are others in the room today who can identify with Stan's story because they too have been set free.
[time=732] There are those of you in the room today who could stand with Stan and say amen.
[time=735] He saved and rescued me and he brought me out of the pit and he's growing me and transforming and changing me.
[time=744] So I wanna just encourage you this morning if you're here and you need help.
[time=748] Maybe God's using Stan's story to encourage you to kind of raise your hand in a sense and come forward and ask us to walk alongside with you.
[time=756] We'd love nothing more than to encourage you in that way.
[time=760] Grandpa, would you come Pastor Carmichael from Kokomo he's gonna come and just pray for his, Stan, come on up here.
[time=767] Pray for his grandson and would you join him as he prays?
[time=771] - Oh, the grace of God, thank you.
[time=775] Heavenly Father, for that grace.
[time=777] That grace has been manifested in Stan Lee's life.
[time=781] But I thank you that the grace of God that has been manifested in Stan Lee's life can be manifested in each one here this morning as we submit ourselves to you.
[time=796] Praise God that Jesus Christ said if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[time=808] And I thank you for the spirit of God that has applied these truths of your word to Stan Lee's heart.
[time=814] And I thank you that the convicting power
[time=820] of the spirit of God does not let his children
[time=826] wander in the pig pens of life.
[time=830] But I thank you that that time came when Stan Lee came home to the Father's house.
[time=837] And we would pray today that his testimony would be a challenge to others as well who are wandering in the world to come back home to the Father's house.
[time=853] Thank you for your grace.
[time=856] And now we would pray specifically for Stan Lee that he would be a man of God.
[time=863] That he would be encouraged day by day to forsake the world and all its alurments.
[time=870] And I pray that Stan Lee we lift his eyes toward heaven and realize that that strength and that power that comes from Almighty God is his because he's one of God's children.
[time=885] So bless them abundantly.
[time=887] Lisa, the children as well.
[time=890] And I pray that his parents and his grandparents that we would be godly examples as well help us never to forget as the parents or grandparents of children that they do look to us.
[time=904] And so therefore I pray that our lives would be such that it would draw them to the Savior and we'll thank you and we'll praise you for Jesus' sake.
[time=917] [AMEN] - Thank you, Pastor.
[time=922] Well, Stan, why don't you come over here and hang on to my hand here.
[time=926] It's a real, it's an honor and joy to as your pastor and friend baptize you this morning here in front of your family and your church family in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=938] (audience applauding)
[time=944] [MUSIC - 223 seconds]
[time=1174] Shine your light on me, shine your light on me, shine your light on me, shine your light on me.
[time=1205] Shine your light on me, shine your light on me.
[time=1212] God shined his light on the whole world when he put his only Son on the cross.
[time=1223] And when we accept and believe the truth that his sacrifice was meant for our redemption and for our good and when we put our faith and our hope in the resurrected Christ.
[time=1233] We can be a bright light to the world.
[time=1237] So like Jesus did at the Last Supper, let's take the bread.
[time=1241] And like he commanded us to do, let's eat it in remembrance of his great sacrifice.
[time=1249] The Bible says that after supper he took the cup.
[time=1253] And he said the blood was also shed for us in light of the new covenant.
[time=1259] And we should drink that and remembrance of him, let's do that together too.
[time=1267] God my prayer is this morning that you would be honored and pleased with our sacrifice of worship today.
[time=1275] That as we remember your sacrifice on the cross and as we eat and drink in remembrance of your broken body
[time=1283] and your spilled blood that we would leave today renewed and ready to shine in a dark world
[time=1289] for your glory and for your praise in Jesus name.
[time=1293] Would you open your Bibles to 1 Timothy chapter 2 verses 8 through 15
[time=1302] and we're going to come back to the passage that we started last week.
[time=1306] We've entitled it men, women and the church, God's design for how each should function.
[time=1313] We spent some time last week talking about the men.
[time=1316] We got into a little bit of what it says here for women and how they are to function in the body of Christ
[time=1323] especially when the body of Christ gathers.
[time=1326] And I want to come back to this passage today and continue to talk and teach and share with you the things that God has for us in this passage.
[time=1335] All one has to do is read first and second Timothy through section by section by section carefully
[time=1343] and thoughtfully and one will see two things.
[time=1346] I mentioned this to you briefly last week.
[time=1348] I want to reiterate this to you this morning.
[time=1350] You'll see two things as you read through the pastoral epistles, even Titus and other letters that Paul writes as he writes to those in the church.
[time=1359] You're going to see two things again and again and again.
[time=1363] Paul's personal concern and love for his audience, in this case for Timothy and the church
[time=1370] as he addresses general issues.
[time=1372] There are things God wanted the church to know that would kind of come under the umbrella of general truth
[time=1378] that it was important for him that everyone see and understand.
[time=1382] You will see that.
[time=1383] We've seen it already.
[time=1384] We'll continue to see it in the letter here to Timothy.
[time=1388] We'll also see in almost every book Paul writes.
[time=1392] You see Paul's correcting instruction.
[time=1396] Paul's corrective instruction as he addresses specific issues and problems that Timothy and the church were facing.
[time=1405] Here are some examples of some specific problems or issues that Paul addresses,
[time=1411] even just right here in 1 Timothy.
[time=1413] We saw false teaching and attack on the gospel in the first chapter.
[time=1418] We see the church had stopped praying or they had stopped to the degree that Paul felt God felt like it was healthy,
[time=1426] so Paul addresses the issue of praying at the beginning of chapter 2.
[time=1430] We see immodest and unruly women were attempting to usurp authority.
[time=1435] We're seeing that in chapter 2.
[time=1437] The need for godly men.
[time=1440] The need for godly men of character to lead and oversee the church.
[time=1444] The church needed to understand God's design and his priority for this.
[time=1449] We'll see that in chapter 3.
[time=1452] You'll see personal and vocational words of encouragement and caution to Timothy, the young man and pastor.
[time=1461] Paul speaks into his pastor and leaders hard in life and encourages him.
[time=1466] You'll see that in chapter 4.
[time=1468] Struggles with how to handle the care for and shepherding of widows.
[time=1473] Specifically in chapter 5, there were some things that weren't happening that God wanted to have happen.
[time=1479] And so, again, Paul writes in a corrective sense to help those in Ephesus at the church there under Timothy's leadership deal with these things.
[time=1487] How to protect, care for, and compensate pastors, elders who teach.
[time=1492] He gets real specific about that in chapter 5.
[time=1495] Warnings and cautions to those in Ephesus and the church there who had an unhealthy view of money.
[time=1501] He writes and speaks to this issue as well.
[time=1504] I bring all of that to your attention to remind you this morning again that God, in his words that we will study again this morning,
[time=1513] delivers to us both his general will for the church and his correction in specific situations where his will was being violated.
[time=1525] So, we come back this morning to chapter 2 verses 8 to 15.
[time=1530] And would you please in honor of God's word stand and allow me to read this to you this morning.
[time=1536] Paul's words to the young pastor in Ephesus, Timothy, as he tries to lead and love the flock there in Ephesus chapter 2 verses 8 to 15.
[time=1546] Therefore, I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without wrath and dissension.
[time=1554] Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly.
[time=1562] Not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments, but rather by means of good works as is proper for women making a claim to godliness.
[time=1574] A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness, but I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.
[time=1588] For it was Adam who was first created and then Eve, and it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being deceived fell into transgression.
[time=1597] But women will be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.
[time=1608] Our Father in Heaven, we stand again before you this morning as we look to your word, expectant and hopeful of what you will show us and teach us again.
[time=1620] Oh God, I pray that we would as a family and that we would as individuals in this room not come to this passage again with hearts that are closed.
[time=1630] God, I pray that we would not come predisposed.
[time=1633] I pray that we would not come to this with hurts or wounds from the past, but oh God, I pray that we would come with great humility and an openness to what the Word of God and the Spirit of God would want to show us and teach us this morning.
[time=1649] God, this is our prayer and this is our hope.
[time=1652] Thank you, God, for the privilege of being together and thank you for the privilege of studying the Scriptures and all the people agreed and said, amen, you can be seated.
[time=1664] Well, we saw last week that there were just some clear obvious realities about the sins of Adam and Eve that we as the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve will repeat again and again and again if we aren't willing to exercise as men and women,
[time=1689] ongoing repentance and caution with respect to how God designed us to function in the church.
[time=1698] We are, so many of you agreed with me last week.
[time=1703] I was so thankful for the response, so many emails and hallway conversations and to get to hear from so many of you about what was in some ways a difficult message to teach.
[time=1714] And yet again and again I heard you say that you understood exactly what we were communicating and that you as a man or you as a woman felt those very things that pulled Adam and Eve away.
[time=1729] You feel those very things that work in you. We are sons and daughters of Adam and Eve as men we will lean towards silent passivity as women you will lean toward control and manipulation and the desire to just be out from under.
[time=1749] And so as we said last week God says to you as men he says it through the pen of the Apostle Paul and in other places in scripture we learn that God says men sons of Adam be careful.
[time=1762] This was the resounding message we walked away with last week, men be careful.
[time=1767] You'll want to step back, you'll want to step away from the confusion at times, you'll want to step away from stuff that doesn't make sense as men will want to step away from speaking hard words or entering into difficult conversations.
[time=1782] God's word says step forward men, step forward and lead, step forward humbly admitting your weakness and your fear and trepidation and engage and be involved.
[time=1798] Step forward and lead I think it's interesting that when he talks about the roles of men and women in the church he brings up Adam and Eve and we have to go back to the garden and in going back to the garden we come back to marriage.
[time=1811] You really can't talk about the role of men and women in the church if you're not willing to talk about the role of men and women in marriage.
[time=1820] And so whether we're talking about at home or whether we're talking about in ministry he says oh men be careful.
[time=1827] Don't step back in silence step forward and lead and engage and be involved he says to women hey women daughters of Eve be careful be so very careful you'll want to draw attention to yourself.
[time=1846] He starts the whole passage out by talking about how you dress how you present yourself publicly.
[time=1852] You want to draw attention to yourself you want to step forward and lead and he says be careful step back and in discreet modesty allow or encourage men to do what God designed them to do.
[time=1868] In the hard part ladies I understand not because I'm a woman but because I'm a man I understand how hard that is because there will be times where we won't lead well.
[time=1881] There will be times when we'll make the wrong decision. There will be times where we will fail miserably.
[time=1893] And God says allow my design to play itself out.
[time=1899] And so we kind of ended there last week we come this morning to the last few verses of this passage and I want to draw your attention to verse 11 and 12.
[time=1909] A woman it says must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness but I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man but to remain quiet we'll stop there.
[time=1925] Three principles this morning I want you to write these down let's look at three principles this morning that Paul lays out for us in verses 11 and 12.
[time=1934] Number one the quiet submissive receiving of instruction by women.
[time=1941] Number one secondly let's look at women not functioning as teachers in the assembly and number three or exercising women not functioning as teachers in the assembly or exercising authority over men in that same setting.
[time=1961] I had somebody ask me this week and I was extremely grateful for the question it was a great question and it got me thinking and it got me to looking and studying and asking I think a very important question and the question someone asked me is why
[time=1978] are you so certain that we should specify this teaching as to what happens in the assembly specifically in the gathering why wouldn't we maybe just think of this in the church in general across the board.
[time=1996] It was a very important question and as I looked at it I want to just bring you back to where I got brought back to again this is my best effort it's not perfect it could be flawed but my best effort at trying to answer that question
[time=2009] for you and for my friend is really back at the beginning of the passage where it says therefore I want the men in every place.
[time=2018] The more I studied and the more I read I came back to this idea that Paul very specifically starts out this discussion of men and women by talking about the activity that goes on in this place and that word simply means the location where that body would gather it looked different
[time=2037] in Paul's day they didn't have this in Paul's day but that word speaks to that place or places where the body would come together for those who led the body to do what God had called them to do.
[time=2056] And so my very best understanding of this for us today is that it really does these verses describe God's design for what happens when the church is gathered when they are in that place.
[time=2070] And I want to just start with that first one this morning let's look at it the quiet submissive receiving of instruction by women referenced there in verse 11 a woman must quietly receive instruction.
[time=2086] Here's how I want to come at this if I could let me just back up just a little bit and can I give you the big picture I think of this issue the issue that's really in play here.
[time=2099] Turn just a few pages over let me just show you 1 Timothy 5 17 as it relates to this issue of instruction biblical teaching in the church and Paul saying that out of the gate here women are to be the recipients of this instruction look at 1 Timothy 5 17.
[time=2119] It says there it says the elders and I'll stop you right there we're going to get to chapter 3 in a few weeks in our study of 1 Timothy there we'll get into this in much more detail but I just want you to understand in general that God's design for leadership in the local church clearly is
[time=2135] as one studies scripture elders God has called elders press butter us is the word there to lead and love the family of God.
[time=2149] This is God's design I think it's very clear I don't think it's debatable I think it's right here again and again and again in the pages of scripture that elders are to oversee
[time=2163] and lovingly lead and guide the local church well it says here in 5 17 the elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor especially those elders who work hard at preaching and teaching.
[time=2180] In the place or location that a local church would gather it was the elders who would preach and teach it was the elders who God designed to bring teaching and equipping to the life of that local body.
[time=2203] You with me go back to 3 to 1 Timothy 3 to just trying to kind of build a foundation on which for us to understand these words Paul gives to women.
[time=2215] It says now with elders in view it says in 3 to it says an overseer or an elder then must be above reproach this is so great we'll get to it in a few weeks he gives a whole list of character qualifications of an elder.
[time=2232] If you're an elder there are to be things evident in your life that would get indication of the fact that your character your integrity who you are and the way you live inside and outside these four walls matches up with this amazing encouraging list of characters
[time=2248] and qualities we'll come to that in the weeks to come but I want you to see this one an overseer then must be above reproach the what say it the husband of one wife the husband of one wife there's a lot to say about that phrase again we won't get into all of that this morning.
[time=2270] But I want you to understand this as it relates to our passage in 1 Timothy in the role of women I believe that's pretty clear to me at least it is that an elder is to be a man.
[time=2289] There are some who would say that this is just a cultural rendering and that really it's okay today to have women elders because they're gifted as leaders and they're spiritually strong and mature and I would not disagree with that for a moment.
[time=2309] I can name you dozens of women in this family whose spiritual strength and integrity and character of life are inspiring to me that's not the issue.
[time=2322] I take husband to be a man and so I believe that to be true.
[time=2333] I think it's God's design for leadership in the church. I believe it's God's design for leadership in the home.
[time=2341] I believe it's to be a loving, humble, gracious leadership that goes to great lengths to sacrifice for lift up honor and cherish a woman.
[time=2354] I believe elders are to give oversight in the church. I believe 3-2 says elders are to be husband of one wife.
[time=2361] Literally that phrase means a one woman man. It's not talking about men who were divorced prior to salvation or widowers who got remade.
[time=2373] It's talking about present tense is this man by character marked as one who is devoted and singular in his mindset and fidelity to the woman he is married to.
[time=2388] In Ephesians 4-11 as it relates to the role of women, I just want you to see what it says there and he gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers.
[time=2402] It goes on in verse 12 to say for the equipping of the saints for the work of service.
[time=2411] It was the elders. It was the pastor and teachers who are to teach and equip and train and build up the body with the scriptures when the body comes together.
[time=2424] Men are to be those who teach the word to the church when it gathers. Why?
[time=2432] People ask it. People are thinking it right now. Well, why?
[time=2436] Is it because we're smarter? Is it because we're better? Is it because we're cooler? Is it because we're stronger? No.
[time=2446] No. It's because the public teaching role is to be filled by elders, pastor, teachers who by virtue of scripture are to be godly men.
[time=2458] It's just how God designed it. It's just how he wanted that to happen.
[time=2464] Now, let me try to give you some insight on the specific situation here in Ephesus.
[time=2469] Real quick, look at two very important words in that verse. Go back, if you would, to verse 11.
[time=2474] It says a woman must quietly receive. You see it? A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness.
[time=2484] Why not? You ever think about this? Why not just say they must receive instruction submissively?
[time=2491] Why say she must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness?
[time=2500] It reminds me, maybe you won't get this. It just strikes a chord with me.
[time=2504] It sounds to me like me in the hallway at 9.30 at night with five kids.
[time=2510] There's a problem, and oftentimes a problem requires correction with emphasis.
[time=2521] Does this make sense?
[time=2524] There were women who were in need of some correction with emphasis.
[time=2530] Clarity was definitely needed in Ephesus at this time on this issue.
[time=2535] Let me explain. Follow along now. I don't ever get into the Greek when I'm teaching most of the New Testament written in Greek.
[time=2543] I don't ever get into it. I've told you this unless I feel like it's really, really helpful.
[time=2546] I really think it's going to be helpful for you as you think this through with me.
[time=2550] The form of the Greek verb translated receive instruction.
[time=2555] You see it there, verse 11? A woman must quietly receive instruction.
[time=2561] The form of the Greek verb for that is an imperative.
[time=2565] It doesn't really read this way, but it's a command.
[time=2570] He, in essence, is his saying, Paul is commanding that women must be taught in the church.
[time=2578] It's an imperative. It's a command. And this was a novel concept. You've got to understand this.
[time=2583] This was culturally unheard of. Women were dirt in that day.
[time=2589] Treated as nothing more than property. They were diminished and denigrated by men and those in authority
[time=2597] and would never have been allowed to participate in any public gathering or assembly.
[time=2602] Historians and biblical scholars agree that there were more than likely a number of women who in reaction to the cultural abuse they had endured were now taking advantage of their new-found acceptance,
[time=2615] their new-found freedom in Christ by reaching out for dominant roles in local church leadership.
[time=2624] Can you see it? Paul is saying in essence to Timothy. I know it's a novel concept, but they've got to be there.
[time=2630] They must receive instruction. It's good for them. I am commanding that they be in the room.
[time=2638] Women cannot be shut out of the learning process. I can see him saying that to Timothy,
[time=2644] but then I can also see him saying to the ladies. Now ladies, I know you've been shut up and beaten down
[time=2651] for years and that your renewed dignity and new-found freedom are exhilarating, but there's a way we need to do this. There's a way God has designed it.
[time=2664] I know there's a part of you that wants to speak up and grab the reins, but God's design in this setting is for elders to teach,
[time=2676] for elders to exercise authority and for you to graciously allow them to do that.
[time=2687] Let's keep going. I know this will sound similar, but let's get to that second point of the three that we laid out, women not functioning as teachers in the assembly.
[time=2699] Verse 12, it says they must quietly receive with entire submissiveness in 11 and verse 12,
[time=2705] but I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.
[time=2714] I want to start with that last phrase. I hope we're on the same page here.
[time=2719] One of the other nuggets of truth I found as I tried to answer my friend's question
[time=2725] about why I believe this is really specifically for the body
[time=2731] when it comes together is that last phrase. What was that last phrase?
[time=2737] He says, "Not allow women to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to what?
[time=2743] To remain quiet." I don't believe for a moment that outside the assembly,
[time=2751] I don't believe it's God's will that women be quiet.
[time=2758] I don't think God is saying that you are to live your life not saying a thing.
[time=2766] I believe God knows that there's great gain and great benefit in you speaking
[time=2772] in all sorts of settings, and I know how you love to do that.
[time=2777] I read this week that women speak 20,000 words a day.
[time=2782] I'm not diminishing or denigrating. It's fantastic how God wires us.
[time=2786] Women speak 20,000 words a day. Guess how many men speak? Seven.
[time=2793] Oh, sorry, 7,000. Seven thousand. I meant 7,000.
[time=2799] I know sometimes ladies, it seems like it's just 7.
[time=2803] No, it's just the way we're wired. It's the way that thing kind of plays out.
[time=2809] But I believe where he says it is my desire that you remain quiet.
[time=2814] He's talking about in the setting as it relates to teaching.
[time=2817] It's the whole concept here. It's the whole context.
[time=2820] I do not allow interesting phrase. Again in the Greek, the Greek word for not allowing.
[time=2828] I do not allow points to a specific problem that must have existed.
[time=2833] In the Greek, the phrase I do not allow speaks to not allowing someone to engage in a practice that they have expressed a strong desire for.
[time=2844] This is can I, can I, can I, can I? This is oh, please, oh, please, oh, please.
[time=2848] This is oh, come on, dad. Let me stay up till 10.
[time=2852] No, I will not allow.
[time=2857] Not allowing someone to engage in a practice that they have expressed a strong desire for.
[time=2863] This is what was transpiring, certainly an ethicist.
[time=2867] The other interesting insight from the Greek in verse 12 is that when it says I don't allow a woman to teach. You see that? Go ahead, look at it.
[time=2874] Just right there, to teach. I do not allow a woman to teach.
[time=2880] He uses a verb form of the Greek verb to teach.
[time=2885] A verb form that indicates an ongoing and regular, consistent process.
[time=2893] And it's best translated to be a teacher on a regular, ongoing basis.
[time=2901] As it relates to the assembly of the church, I do not allow a woman to be a teacher
[time=2908] on a regular and ongoing basis.
[time=2912] Regular teaching in the assembly was an important official leadership function in the church.
[time=2918] We just read about it. I just took you to those passages.
[time=2922] So Paul is forbidding women from filling the office of pastor, elder teacher.
[time=2929] He's not prohibiting women from teaching in other appropriate contexts and settings.
[time=2935] He's reminding women, and in the process, he's reminding men that elders and pastor teachers are the ones who are to teach and equip when the body gathers.
[time=2950] Does that make sense? Seems pretty clear.
[time=2955] Now, there have been times in the past where I've invited women to share things with us as a body,
[time=2962] to pass along teaching insights from a woman's perspective.
[time=2967] Insights and perspective that I've wanted our church family to hear.
[time=2972] But in situations where I've had women do that, these were not unruly women functioning in independence.
[time=2980] These were not women who were demanding their time on the stage.
[time=2985] These were women characterized by humility.
[time=2988] And quietly, these were women characterized by quietly receiving instruction on a regular basis.
[time=2995] An authority wasn't being usurped. I had invited them.
[time=2999] And I want you to look at that idea of authority being usurped. Look at verse 12 again.
[time=3005] I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority in this setting over a man.
[time=3015] Somebody, honestly, with a great attitude asked me last week.
[time=3020] And again, with a really good attitude, they asked me about our children's director, Janice Mariezy, who exercises authority in her leadership over our children's ministries.
[time=3031] There are a number of you men who serve in that ministry.
[time=3035] And by serving in that ministry, serve under Janice's leadership as she gives direction.
[time=3040] And as she does her best to help us as a family shepherd and care for our kids, we're very thankful for Janice's leadership in that setting. Amen?
[time=3051] The fact is Janice serves in that position humbly.
[time=3055] Janice serves in that position with entire submission to the elders and those who care for her as her spiritual leaders.
[time=3064] It is a wonderful relationship. And there are other examples of that.
[time=3068] In this setting, it seems clear that God wants authority, especially that authority
[time=3074] that's connected to teaching to come from those who govern and lead.
[time=3081] With the context being in every place that the church gathers, God says, "I desire men to exercise authority.
[time=3088] I desire that elders would step forward and lovingly lead."
[time=3095] All right, we come to the end of the passage here.
[time=3099] We're going to end real quick. Thank goodness there's only two minutes left.
[time=3103] Because we come to a verse here that several of you have asked me, "What in the world are you going to say about verse 15?" So here, I'm just going to face my fear, okay?
[time=3114] But women here, it says this.
[time=3117] Why it says this in the Bible, I've never understood.
[time=3120] I'll just be very honest with you right up front.
[time=3122] But women will be discharged. Some Bibles say saved.
[time=3126] Mine says preserved. But women will be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint. Okay.
[time=3137] I'll just let you in on a little philosophy of mine.
[time=3140] Whether it's parenting, whether it's marriage, whether it's leadership, I've just developed this philosophy over the years.
[time=3146] Whenever I come up against something, when I was younger, I didn't do this, but now that I'm older, I do.
[time=3152] When I come up against something that I just don't understand, when the answer to the question that so many times people ask me is, "I don't have a clue." Which really, as I get older, seems to be more often.
[time=3166] Whenever I don't know the answer, I always just revert back to what I do know.
[time=3172] And there are some things that I do know about that verse, and they're really summed up here in the notes at the bottom of my page here. So let me just read this to you if I can.
[time=3184] All right. Listen. Here we go.
[time=3186] "Women being preserved through the bearing of children." The Greek word can also mean to rescue, to preserve safe and unharmed, to heal or to deliver from.
[time=3198] This word preserved or saved actually occurs several times in the New Testament without ever giving reference to spiritual salvation.
[time=3212] Paul is not advocating that women are eternally saved from their sin through childbearing, or that they maintain their salvation by having babies, both of which would be clear contradictions to the New Testament teaching of salvation by what?
[time=3231] By grace alone through what? Faith.
[time=3236] Amen? There is one way that people are saved if we're talking about salvation.
[time=3247] But we're not talking about salvation.
[time=3250] Listen. We're not talking about salvation in this passage. We're talking about roles.
[time=3257] Does that make sense? Salvation isn't the thrust of this teaching.
[time=3262] It's the role of the man. It's the role of the woman in the midst of their life and their church.
[time=3270] This is interesting. Paul is teaching, the guy who wrote this clearly is willing to go out and say this is what it means.
[time=3277] Paul is teaching that even though a woman bears the stigma of being the initial instrument, which led her and Adam into sin, it is women through childbearing who may be preserved or freed from that stigma by raising a generation of godly children.
[time=3302] Women aren't the only ones in a home who get the privilege of raising a godly generation. I understand that.
[time=3308] I also know that Paul's being general here because Paul said in 1 Corinthians 7 that not all women get married.
[time=3315] So take this for, you know, just hear this.
[time=3319] One of the roles that a woman, because she bears children, has the privilege of filling in a very unique way, is the investment of truth and love and life into our next generation.
[time=3334] In the process, she gets freed. In the process, she gets encouraged.
[time=3338] In the process, she is preserved as she gets to participate in that.
[time=3343] I read that.
[time=3346] It makes a little bit of sense. I don't know that that's the whole thing.
[time=3350] And someday I'll just ask God, why in the world did you put 1st Timothy 2, 15?
[time=3356] In the Bible, we'll get a real good answer. Amen?
[time=3359] But either way, I hope this morning you leave encouraged.
[time=3362] And I hope this morning you understand our great love for men and the God-given opportunity. He has given us to lovingly, carefully, with wisdom, lead, and love our homes, and the church.
[time=3374] And I hope you sense the great love that we have for women, the enormous strength, and God-given talent they bring to our lives, to our ministry, to our homes. It is a mutual submission.
[time=3386] God calls us to in Ephesians. It is a mutual respect.
[time=3389] And we go to great lengths here to do that very thing.
[time=3393] It seems clear to us that God's design for elders and those who teach and how that teaching is delivered in the gathering.
[time=3400] It's very clear to me that He's laid that out for us and we've done our best this morning to share that with you.
[time=3406] If you have any questions, let us know. Would you stand?
[time=3408] And let me pray for us as we go.
[time=3411] Our Father in Heaven, we're grateful this morning for the privilege we've had to proclaim all that is true and right and good about you.
[time=3419] God, what an encouragement to hear, stand this morning, share His story.
[time=3423] What a privilege to lift up the great truth of your son and our worship and our celebration of communion. God, thank you for your word and the way it speaks into the very real issues of our lives.
[time=3435] I thank God, most of all, I would just ask that you would give us as leaders.
[time=3439] I pray that you would give us as parents.
[time=3444] I pray, God, that you would give anybody in this room who gets to influence a young person.
[time=3450] That you'd give us the wisdom to help young men be men.
[time=3455] That you would help us to exercise the great privilege of helping young women be godly women who model and take after the design God that you have laid out.
[time=3467] We need not look to culture.
[time=3470] We need not look to popular opinion.
[time=3473] We need not even look to our own bent and our own natural leanings. God, we need to look to your truth.
[time=3481] And I pray you'd give us strength to do that as we invest in men and women, both young and old. Thank you for this time together.
