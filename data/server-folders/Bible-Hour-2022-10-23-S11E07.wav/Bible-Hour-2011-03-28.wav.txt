[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] It's great to have you with us and I am so grateful today to have my friend Rod Ovitt.
[time=40] With me, you may recognize Rod, you may not, but Rod and his wife Carolyn are not only a huge part of my life personally in my family's life, but they are a part of the Blackhawk ministry's family life as well.
[time=53] God really put on Rod and Carolyn's heart.
[time=56] Number of years ago, the desire to start and give leadership to an Institute, an opportunity for people here at Blackhawk and across this region to better understand and know the great truths of scripture.
[time=72] And as we talked about it and as Rod came to our elders, out of that has been birthed logos Institute of biblical studies.
[time=80] And we are so grateful for what logos is accomplishing all around this region as people just like you come and are being trained and equipped and taught the great truths and the great doctrines of our faith.
[time=94] And I wanted Rod to just give you an update today.
[time=97] You heard us maybe a while ago talk about this, but Rod, you're kind of halfway through this first semester, if you will, this first shot at this thing.
[time=107] I keep hearing great things about what God is doing here and in the other satellite sites.
[time=113] And I'd love it if you just kind of give me and the viewing audience an update.
[time=117] How's it been going so far?
[time=118] How are you encouraged?
[time=119] What's going on?
[time=120] - Well, it's been great, Kelly.
[time=122] First quarter just finished.
[time=124] And I can actually say here without hype, you can join hundreds of people that have come to the Institute.
[time=132] It's really, we started with almost 300 people.
[time=135] So we're just elated with that.
[time=138] We think a lot of them are going to be bringing friends because it's changed lives.
[time=143] I'm not quite sure what people expected.
[time=146] I mean, they heard the broadcast.
[time=147] They, in fact, we've had quite a few come from the Black Hawk Bible Hour audience, which is great from Ohio and other places.
[time=156] And I think they come expecting, okay, we're going to have a little bit of college, you know, okay, we're going to watch a video or something.
[time=162] And what they find is number one, this is a PhD.
[time=167] He really knows what he's talking about.
[time=168] They see the students in the audience.
[time=171] So after one or two times, it's a big enough screen.
[time=174] They feel like I'm actually there.
[time=176] And then I'm upfront facilitating with my finger on the button because the prof says something I stop.
[time=182] And I say, what do you think about that?
[time=184] How's this going?
[time=185] Oh, I had a little Greek or something and we'll amplify because as you know, the prof knows all that, but we have him a moment in time.
[time=194] So you can always add to it.
[time=195] - So there's a prof on video teaching.
[time=198] You're facilitating.
[time=200] And so those who come and participate not only get the lecture, but they get interaction and community.
[time=207] - Right, interaction and about an extra half hour of information that the prof would have probably given himself if he was there.
[time=214] But, you know, so it's added.
[time=216] So they come out, what we basically say to them, Kelly, is if you make the effort to end the discipline to come, we and the Holy Spirit will do the rest.
[time=227] Really, that's awesome.
[time=228] Just carve out that hour and a half.
[time=230] Get here, we're out on time religiously.
[time=233] Come here, you go home and you're blown away.
[time=237] And we go on five weeks, then you get a week off.
[time=241] So then we had another five weeks.
[time=243] Now we're in our in-between break.
[time=246] - That's awesome.
[time=247] - Five weeks on, a week off, five weeks on, and a chance for every one of you who would be interested to come.
[time=254] And not just get an education, but I think really get an experience where your faith is going to be challenged, your understanding of the truth is going to be heightened, and you're going to meet some great people.
[time=265] Monday nights out at Lakewood, Tuesdays.
[time=268] - Chapel?
[time=269] - At the chapel.
[time=270] Wednesdays, they're here on the Blackhawk campus.
[time=273] - Right, right.
[time=274] - Rest of the week goes out.
[time=275] - Yeah, Thursday's pathway.
[time=277] - That's right.
[time=278] - And so we're covering all the geography.
[time=279] Saturday mornings, we're down at Greater Progressive at the YMCA, the old Fort YMCA, yeah.
[time=285] And we're having a great time, two times a night.
[time=288] We're on at six to seven, 30, seven, 30 to nine.
[time=293] And then, so that's two classes.
[time=296] And then Saturday, we're on at nine to 10, 30, 10, 30 to 12.
[time=299] - Awesome.
[time=300] Hey Rod, give the people a website to go to.
[time=302] Where should they go to learn more about logos and see some of the pricing and the schedule and that kind of thing?
[time=308] - Right, we're at www.logos, biblical.org,
[time=314] and so that's www.logos, biblical.org.
[time=318] And you're gonna find out it's $5 a class.
[time=320] Basically, we asked you to buy a group, a semester 10 for $50.
[time=325] And we covered the whole baccalaureate program, your Old Testament, New Testament surveys.
[time=331] I tell you one that's changing lives is our introduction of the survey of doctrine.
[time=336] When you take regular people out of your parishioners and you sit 'em down and you start talking about the attributes of God, theology, bibliology, it changes you.
[time=347] - It opens up all kinds of things, folks have never considered.
[time=349] Well, we're grateful for Rod and Carolyn.
[time=351] So thankful for the Institute.
[time=353] Most of you know, Blackhawk has been for years and years.
[time=356] So thankful for the teaching of God's word that he's allowed us to do.
[time=361] And here we have the teaching of God's word and his truth and doctrine spreading all over the region, Rod, thank you.
[time=367] Thanks for what you're doing.
[time=369] - Thank you.
[time=369] - Thanks for your friendship.
[time=370] And those of you in the audience, thanks for tuning in today.
[time=373] I hope you'll go to the website and you'll check it out.
[time=376] We can't wait for you to learn more and be equipped in more meaningful ways through logos.
[time=381] Thanks so much for tuning in.
[time=382] Have a great weekend as always.
[time=384] We hope to see you soon.
[time=386] [MUSIC - 38 seconds]
[time=428] - I will follow.
[time=429] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=444] - Hey, if you would, please open your Bibles
[time=452] to the first Timothy chapter three.
[time=454] We make our way to the third chapter today in our study of first Timothy.
[time=458] First Timothy chapter three versus one to seven.
[time=462] We have learned much.
[time=463] We have had the privilege of wrestling with and interacting with passage after passage in chapters one and two.
[time=472] I'm so grateful for the way in which we've done that.
[time=475] Thankful for the encouragement that I've received from many of you over the last couple of weeks as we taught about men and women and leadership in the church.
[time=484] And I'm excited today to come to a new section in our study that we've entitled Leadership Matters.
[time=491] Leadership matters.
[time=493] Certainly it does.
[time=494] When you understand the great priority of the church, when you understand that this is the bride of Christ, when you understand that the church is God's agent, the church, God's tool, in his providential sovereign wisdom, he chooses the church, you and me, those who are fully surrendered followers of Christ, God chooses the church to move his kingdom forward.
[time=520] When you realize how very important the church is to him, then you understand how important leadership is.
[time=527] Those who lead it, what's that to look like?
[time=529] Who's supposed to do that?
[time=531] What is that leadership supposed to play out?
[time=535] How is that supposed to look?
[time=536] Great insights and great truths for us here in chapter three, as we come to this section on leadership in the church.
[time=543] And before we jump into it, would you just show honor and reverence to God and stand with me as we read his word, 1 Timothy chapter three, verses one through seven.
[time=555] It is a trustworthy statement, Paul writes.
[time=560] If any man aspires to the office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires to do.
[time=570] An overseer then must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but gentle, peaceable, free from the love of money.
[time=591] He must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity.
[time=600] But if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God, the household of God?
[time=608] And this man, verse six, must not be a new convert, so that he will not become conceited and fall into the condemnation occurred by the devil.
[time=617] And he must have a good reputation with those outside the church, so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
[time=629] Father, as we often do, we stand here before you this morning,
[time=635] and we ask with great humility and with great expectancy
[time=641] and with great gratitude that you would teach us, that you would enlighten us.
[time=648] God, there are those in the room this morning who have never heard these truths.
[time=658] There are those who have heard these truths taught for years, and yet their life today lacks the clarity and the application of this truth.
[time=666] And oh, God, I pray that you would help those of us who need your help on these things.
[time=673] God, we pray that you would bring it.
[time=675] We pray that you would move us in new directions.
[time=678] God, for those who have heard this, teaching for years and their lives are characterized by the things we've already read.
[time=687] We thank you, Father, for them.
[time=689] We thank you for their testimony.
[time=691] We thank you for their lives.
[time=693] We thank you for the way they've modeled these things and continue to model these principles.
[time=699] God, we need it in the church.
[time=701] We need those who would model godliness in our lives.
[time=706] So, God, we come to this passage again this morning and pray that you would do an amazing work in us.
[time=711] Free us from all predisposition.
[time=713] Free us from any fears.
[time=715] Free us from any confusion and allow us to receive the word of God implanted, which is able to save us and grow us and nurture us.
[time=723] We pray in your son's name.
[time=726] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=731] Hey, let me come at this teaching this morning on leadership in the local church.
[time=734] Let me just come at it initially here from maybe just a different perspective than maybe we've come at it from in the past.
[time=740] I wanna just try and set a foundation for our teaching that I hope gives to each and every one of you a clear sense of the heart of God behind his teaching here on leadership.
[time=754] And I wanna try to establish that foundation of the heart of God as it relates to leadership by just putting a simple phrase on the screen.
[time=763] And that simple phrase is this.
[time=765] God loves his people.
[time=769] Oh, please don't read it too quickly.
[time=771] Don't move on mentally too much.
[time=773] Just stay there for a moment.
[time=774] God, do you know this?
[time=777] Do you understand this?
[time=778] God, the God of heaven, our heavenly Father.
[time=782] God loves his people.
[time=787] God has a great heart for his people.
[time=791] For God so loved you.
[time=798] For God so loved the world that he gave his only son.
[time=801] [AMEN] Roman Zate says that we can never be.
[time=805] Roman Zate said there isn't anything on the face of this earth.
[time=808] Roman Zate teaches us there is absolutely nothing that could ever separate those who are his that could ever separate us from his love.
[time=819] Nothing can come in between the love of God that he has for his people.
[time=825] God loves his people.
[time=828] My friends, God has loved us from the beginning.
[time=831] God loves us today.
[time=832] God will always love his people.
[time=837] [AMEN] Now, as much as you and I would say amen to that, as much as we sort of kind of can put our arms around that.
[time=844] Let me change a word in that phrase on the screen.
[time=848] And I think for most of us, it sort of brings it to a whole new light.
[time=852] God loves his who?
[time=854] His kids.
[time=857] And I know this is a mixed bag.
[time=858] I understand that in some cases.
[time=861] Everybody in the room's a kid, right?
[time=864] We've all got moms and dads.
[time=866] Some of us experienced that in a really, really good and healthy
[time=872] way for others of us, it was a little challenging.
[time=874] But the fact of the matter is you know whatever your past is.
[time=877] You and I know that God designed it this way and that in many cases, it is this way that there is a deep and passionate love that a father has for his kids, for his children.
[time=893] God is passionate, my friends, about caring for, teaching, protecting, disciplining his children.
[time=901] The scriptures speak to this again and again and again.
[time=905] God's passionate, God's faithful, God's ongoing, God's never-ending pursuit.
[time=911] His love and his care for his children.
[time=915] He, God, remember, is a father.
[time=920] Mothers, you can relate to this, I know.
[time=923] But I want to just make sure that we understand that in that very unique way, God views us.
[time=928] God has always viewed us as His children.
[time=933] He is our father.
[time=937] He has always been deeply devoted.
[time=940] You go back to the people of Israel.
[time=942] You go back to creation.
[time=943] You go back to the story of Israel.
[time=944] You go back to the disciples.
[time=946] You go back to His early followers.
[time=947] You look at the history of the church.
[time=948] God has always been deeply devoted to nurturing His children, those who are His.
[time=955] Now here's what I want to ask you this morning.
[time=956] I just want every mom and dad in the room to think about this.
[time=959] And I'm not trying to be overdramatic.
[time=961] I'm not trying to somehow take you to a place that's too uncomfortable.
[time=966] But I just want you to think, what if?
[time=967] I just want you to imagine this morning, what if, for whatever reason, and we won't get into all those, but what if you had to leave your kids?
[time=980] What if you were going to leave your kids?
[time=984] What if something happened?
[time=986] And the fact of the matter was that in due time here in a few days, you were going to have to be separated from your kids forever.
[time=997] You wouldn't be with them again.
[time=1000] You wouldn't see them.
[time=1002] You wouldn't touch them.
[time=1003] You wouldn't be with them.
[time=1006] You would be separated from them for a long, long time.
[time=1012] And yet you were given in this time between a chance to make sure you were given the opportunity to figure out who it was that would provide them with the care and the oversight and the investment that they would need.
[time=1029] If you had to leave them, wouldn't you care more than words
[time=1035] could describe who you left them with?
[time=1039] Amen?
[time=1043] Sure you would.
[time=1045] And I want to submit to you this morning that God has done the very same thing.
[time=1051] In light of his absence, him physically, literally, not being here with us, how does God care for his family?
[time=1062] Yes, there will be a day when God and his family will be reunited.
[time=1066] But what has God done?
[time=1068] What has God put in place to care for, oversee, instruct discipline, come alongside, give heart and effort to his kids?
[time=1079] You know what he's done?
[time=1083] God has appointed leaders.
[time=1087] It's the way he designed it.
[time=1089] God has appointed leaders to lovingly provide oversight for those he loves.
[time=1096] In the Old Testament, it was prophets and priests who God designed in his sovereign plan there.
[time=1104] He designed for prophets and priests to interact with the people and go between he and them and provide for them the loving wisdom and oversight they desperately needed.
[time=1112] It didn't always go so well.
[time=1113] But that was God's plan in that time.
[time=1117] In the New Testament age, in the church age, which we find ourselves right in the midst of today, God has chosen elders, deacons, pastors, bishops, overseers to provide the loving care that he knew his children needed.
[time=1134] And as we come to chapter three in our study of First Timothy, a study we've entitled True Church, God's Design for the Body, for the Body of Christ, we get a very clear picture of what God designed and what God desired for the care and oversight of his family.
[time=1149] The people of God, God's children, were to be loved and led by elders.
[time=1153] God-honoring men of character.
[time=1156] God-honoring men of integrity who would with great passion and diligence put their hearts and arms around the family of God and love them and lead them in his ways, in his absence.
[time=1174] And as you look through the pages of Scripture, oh my goodness, there are so many instances of those who have done that so very well.
[time=1182] And there are so many instances of those who have not, leaders appointed by God to care for his people, who hid it out of the park and those who failed miserably.
[time=1194] Let me show you an example this morning.
[time=1196] Go back in your Old Testament if you would to the book of Ezekiel.
[time=1200] Would you do that?
[time=1201] Right before you get to Daniel, you'll come to Ezekiel and Ezekiel comes right after you get to lamentations.
[time=1211] From lamentations you go right to Ezekiel and I want you to go to Ezekiel 34.
[time=1215] Let me hear those pages turning, come on.
[time=1217] Ezekiel 34, I want to show you an example this morning of ungodly leadership that lost its way.
[time=1226] Those designed by God to care for his people in his absence who just didn't get it done.
[time=1232] And I don't want to just show them to you.
[time=1234] I want you to see, as we start this discussion this morning, I want you to see what went wrong.
[time=1240] I want you to see where they wandered from his plan.
[time=1243] Ezekiel 34, it says there in verses one to six, then the word of the Lord came to me saying, son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel.
[time=1255] Prophecy and say to those shepherds, thus says the Lord God, whoa, not whoa as in stop but whoa as in be damned.
[time=1270] Is that phrase?
[time=1271] Whoa, on the shepherds of Israel
[time=1277] who have been feeding themselves should not the shepherds feed the flock.
[time=1283] You eat the fat and clothe yourself with the wool.
[time=1287] You slaughter the fat sheep without feeding the flock.
[time=1290] Those who are sickly, listen.
[time=1292] Those who are sickly you have not strengthened.
[time=1295] The diseased you have not healed.
[time=1297] The broken you have not bound up.
[time=1300] The scattered you have not brought back nor have you sought for the lost.
[time=1306] Do you see that shepherds and leaders are to care for the sickly, for the diseased, for the broken, for the scattered?
[time=1314] Nor have you sought for the lost, but with force and with severity you have dominated them.
[time=1322] They were scattered for lack of a shepherd and they became food for every beast of the field and were scattered.
[time=1329] My flock wandered through the mountains and on every high hill my flock was scattered over all the surface of the earth and there was no one.
[time=1338] Here's what shepherds do.
[time=1340] To search or seek for them.
[time=1343] And then you skip down to verse 10 and you hear words you'd never ever wanna hear.
[time=1349] I would never ever wanna hear these words.
[time=1353] Thus says the Lord God, behold I, God am against the shepherds.
[time=1358] And I will demand my sheep from them and make them cease from feeding sheep.
[time=1365] So the shepherds will not feed themselves anymore, but I will deliver my flock from their mouth so that they will not be food for them.
[time=1375] A lot to take in there.
[time=1378] Really just want you to read it and see it and kind of get the gist of what happens when this thing goes south.
[time=1385] If I were to summarize it for you, I'd just try and say it very clearly, poor elders, poor shepherds, those who don't lead well.
[time=1397] Whether we're talking about the family of God, whether we're talking about your family.
[time=1404] Poor dads, poor husbands.
[time=1409] You can kind of throw it all there in one mix.
[time=1412] Here's the deal, they get selfish.
[time=1415] When it goes south, you got a guy who got selfish.
[time=1422] And when you get selfish, listen, you get distracted.
[time=1429] Because you're thinking more about you than you are about them.
[time=1435] And when you get distracted, the scattered don't get found.
[time=1440] The sick don't get helped.
[time=1441] The broken don't get bound up.
[time=1443] The hurting don't get comforted, are you with me?
[time=1446] Selfishness leads to a distance.
[time=1450] It leads to a distracted spirit.
[time=1453] And God-honoring leadership never occurs with those who choose selfishness and fall into distraction.
[time=1462] Here's an elder though, go to Acts 20.
[time=1465] Let's paint a picture here real quick as we start this discussion in 1 Timothy 3.
[time=1470] Go to Acts 20, let me show you an elder who did a really good job.
[time=1474] Let me show you one who's eldering and whose leadership was something that others were able to model and follow after in the days to come.
[time=1484] I'm talking about the Apostle Paul himself who in Acts 20, look what it says in Acts 20, 17, would you?
[time=1491] It says in Acts 20, 17, from my lead us, he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church.
[time=1501] I want to stop there.
[time=1501] It's interesting as we come to Acts 20 that Paul is calling, he's getting ready to take off.
[time=1507] He has loved and been with these guys in ministry for a couple of years, they mean so much to him.
[time=1511] He's got to give them some parting comments.
[time=1514] He wants to leave them with some parting teaching.
[time=1517] They are dear to him, these elders of the church of Ephesus.
[time=1523] Interesting, our study of 1 Timothy, we're studying this letter from Paul to Timothy who was the pastor of the church at Ephesus.
[time=1534] It's an interesting connection here.
[time=1536] And I want you to see what Paul says in Paul's words to his dear friends, you see a great model of godly leadership.
[time=1544] He says in verse 18, and when they had come to him, he said to them, you, you know, here's Paul talking to the elders, you yourselves know from the first day that I set foot in Asia, the first day I came to town how I was with you the whole time.
[time=1562] Stop there and I hope you'll just take a few quick notes here.
[time=1566] Paul's leadership, my friends, Paul's eldering was marked by number one.
[time=1570] I want you to write this down, proximity.
[time=1573] Would you write that down?
[time=1574] Paul's leadership, Paul's eldering, was characterized by proximity.
[time=1579] Now listen, again, I know the context here is the church.
[time=1583] This is what we're teaching.
[time=1584] This is what I'm wanting to communicate today, what godly leadership, how elders function and what their lives look like.
[time=1593] And here the context is Paul talking to the elders at Ephesus, but I want you to understand something while that is the direct and primary teaching.
[time=1600] As we talk about leadership, man, I wanna make sure you understand that whether we're talking about the leadership of the church or whether we're talking about the leadership of the home, whether we're talking about your leadership in the office, whether we're talking about your leadership anywhere, these godly biblical principles can apply.
[time=1623] Yes, the primary source of application here in our teaching is God's design for the church, but men, I want you to understand how important these qualities are, how very true these principles are in the whole of your life, in your efforts and mind to lead and love wherever God has us.
[time=1644] Number one, I wanna just make sure you write this down, proximity, please guys understand whether it's the family of God or whether it's your family, you cannot lead them meaningfully from a distance.
[time=1656] You cannot lead them from distant casual observation.
[time=1662] You cannot lead and love your family and the way God designed from a back row, back seat posture that sorta knows what's going on, you kind of see what's transpiring, maybe you'll get caught up by someone else, maybe at some point you'll deal with it, no.
[time=1685] No, Paul says to the Ephesus elders, he says, you know from the day I was there how I was with you, with you that phrase means in the midst of you,
[time=1698] Godly leadership is in the midst of what's going on, it's not distant from it, it's up close.
[time=1706] Look at the passage as it continues on, he says, you know I was with you the whole time serving the Lord with all what, say it church, with all humility, I wanna just remind you again that Godly leadership here in the church, Godly leadership in the home, Godly leadership anywhere is not arrogant.
[time=1729] It isn't domineering, it isn't powering up, it isn't slamming your fist down, it isn't barking, decrees and declarations, there may be times when strength is needed, but all please don't be mistaken, Godly leadership begins with a humility that seeks to serve and love and care for and come alongside with sleeves rolled up.
[time=1758] Elders have to serve in this fashion.
[time=1762] Men who lead in the home have to serve their wives and their kids in this fashion.
[time=1766] You don't lead from a distance, you don't lead with arrogance, no, it's with proximity and I hope you're writing these down with humble service.
[time=1775] First 19 continues, he says, I was with you the whole time serving the Lord with all humility and with what, say it out loud church, with tears.
[time=1784] Paul says I was serving you with tears and this gives us insight, guys, don't freak out, I'm not gonna require you start crying.
[time=1792] This isn't necessarily the point, although it's not far from it, because you can be quick to say, well, I'm a guy and I don't cry very much, but I wanna just tell you this, I wanna say this to you, I don't care who you are.
[time=1808] If you're a man in this room and God's given you the opportunity to lead and influence, it will never happen with a heart that's closed off.
[time=1816] It will never happen the way God designed it to with a heart, listen, that doesn't care.
[time=1822] You'll, you have to care.
[time=1826] And to men in this room, I would say, just to help you with that, you gotta care more about it, you gotta care more about her, you gotta care more about them, you gotta care more about the congregate, you gotta care more about God's calling on you to engage at that level than you do about so many other things that wait too many times, you and I care more about.
[time=1848] We tend to get stirred, which is what that, tears,
[time=1854] I mean, write it down, Paul's leadership as Eldering was marked by passion.
[time=1858] And for many men in this room, I would just need to ask you
[time=1864] and we could kinda start to get some clarity here.
[time=1866] What are you most passionate about?
[time=1869] You may not be a crier, but all we know when you're moved.
[time=1874] And here Paul says, I was moved.
[time=1876] I was moved to tears, I was engaged.
[time=1881] This meant so much to me.
[time=1884] It was not within difference that he meant this challenge, no, it was with great passion, with tears, and with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews.
[time=1898] And then he gives us one more characteristic here, how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable.
[time=1906] Oh, I hope, I hope our elders, I hope our leaders, I hope anybody who has the chance to influence in any setting understands that phrase, how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable and teaching you publicly and from house to house, Paul's leadership, his Eldering was marked by boldness.
[time=1929] Please write that down.
[time=1930] It was marked, it was characterized by boldness.
[time=1932] And he would go and he would teach them publicly, he would go and he would teach them privately.
[time=1939] He would not step back, he was not afraid.
[time=1943] There was a sense of boldness and courage in him to tell them to teach them to say anything to them if he knew in his heart that it would be profitable.
[time=1953] If they needed to hear it, he said it.
[time=1957] He trusted God with the results.
[time=1959] And that is just in short a tremendous picture of Godly Eldering.
[time=1964] It's a tremendous picture of Godly leadership.
[time=1968] Maybe we'll come back to that passage in the days to come and try and dig some more truth out of there but I wanted to just kind of set that as a backdrop.
[time=1977] Now let's look at our passage.
[time=1979] Would you turn to this description of the Godly leader in 1 Timothy three, it's a great passage.
[time=1989] This God delivered God ordained list of character qualities for those who would serve as elders.
[time=1996] Now in this discussion this morning, I want to say this as we start.
[time=2001] This isn't just for older men.
[time=2003] I really want to make a point here.
[time=2004] I hope you'll catch this.
[time=2005] I hope we can be in agreement on this.
[time=2008] While certainly the primary context is for those men who would be considering or those men who would be already Eldering in the local church.
[time=2017] I want to say this.
[time=2019] I want to say that this passage is equally as vital and equally as important for boys and for young men.
[time=2028] We got any boys in the audience today.
[time=2034] We got any young men.
[time=2036] I mean, I'm really thankful for the 40 and 50 and 60 year old but I want to say something to those of you who are 12 and 16 and 22, you're late twenties.
[time=2048] I want to say of all the heroes that are out there getting put in front of you.
[time=2055] Of all the role models that are supposedly out there for you to see, I want to say to you young men, not just our elders but to you boys in the room and those who are watching.
[time=2069] I want to say that as you look at this list of character qualities of a godly man, I want to say this to you boys.
[time=2075] This is who you should want to be.
[time=2078] And I won't shrink back from saying that to you.
[time=2082] This is the man that you should want to be.
[time=2087] You should have a huge desire and we should as older men in your lives help you develop this desire to be a godly man whose life is characterized by these qualities.
[time=2102] Hear me on this young men, you should and I want you to.
[time=2105] I want you to pursue your dreams to be teachers and doctors and lawyers and civic leaders, musicians, accountants, builders, law enforcement, salesmen, go for it.
[time=2117] I want you to do all that you can and whatever arena God chooses to send you in.
[time=2121] But you know what?
[time=2122] You should want to have in your life as a young man the character qualities required by God to help love and lead the church.
[time=2132] Elder, Godly man should be way, way up there in that picture of what it is you aspire and long to be.
[time=2145] Now let's look for a moment at chapter three.
[time=2148] Let's start right there in verse one.
[time=2150] First Timothy three, leadership matters.
[time=2153] God's designed for the church as it relates to elders.
[time=2156] It says it is a trustworthy statement.
[time=2159] You all see that?
[time=2160] Yes, it is a trustworthy statement.
[time=2165] I want you, I'm gonna stop right there, sorry.
[time=2168] They're always giving me a bad time for stopping and going back, but I gotta stop and go back here.
[time=2172] Go back to 115, there's one other place.
[time=2175] Steve Webster and I were talking about this just earlier in the week.
[time=2177] There's one other place so far in first Timothy, go to 115.
[time=2181] It says in 115, it is a trustworthy statement.
[time=2186] It's a powerful phrase in the Greek.
[time=2188] When anybody would read that, they would stop and they would realize this is really, really important.
[time=2193] And sure enough, in 115, it is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.
[time=2202] In 115, it is a trustworthy statement is connected to the gospel.
[time=2216] It's really important stuff when someone would say it is a trustworthy statement.
[time=2222] Well, the next time we see it is a trustworthy statement is where?
[time=2227] Chapter three, verse one, as God sends us into this discussion of leadership.
[time=2233] It is a trustworthy statement.
[time=2236] Hey, he says, stop, pay attention.
[time=2239] Listen, if any man aspires to the office of overseer,
[time=2245] it is a fine work he desires to do.
[time=2250] All right, here's what I want you to do.
[time=2251] I just want you to take your pen.
[time=2252] If you're okay writing in your Bible or if you're gonna just take notes, I want you to just circle or underline.
[time=2257] Aspires, desires and fine.
[time=2268] Let me just break this down for you.
[time=2270] It's just a great first statement here.
[time=2272] If any man aspires to the office.
[time=2276] Okay, in the Greek, this word aspires would have to do with kind of a physical or outward reaching for in a good way.
[time=2288] In an appropriate way, the word aspires would paint a picture of a guy who is physically, actually in essence kind of saying, I want to do this.
[time=2299] I want to go ahead, it means to reach and to take.
[time=2302] And again, not in a selfish way, but it brings to light physical outward movement toward something.
[time=2310] You with me?
[time=2311] But watch this, if any man that says, if any man aspires to the office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires.
[time=2320] And that word desire, that word desire has to do with something very intimate going on in that man's heart before God.
[time=2332] Before God, something has transpired.
[time=2336] Before God in a very personal way, God has been moving.
[time=2340] Before God in a very quiet, very non-public way, something has been set in motion.
[time=2347] Teaching has occurred and there is this internal desire that leads to a spire, that leads to the actual reaching out for.
[time=2359] What a great thought.
[time=2362] If any man outwardly reaches for the office of overseer, it is a fine work he inwardly, intimately before God desires to do one leading to the other.
[time=2376] Now, look at that word fine.
[time=2379] It says, it is a fine, this eldering, this shepherding of the family of God,
[time=2389] this overseeing of the church.
[time=2393] God says to all of you men, and again, I wanna just make sure we don't leave out the younger ones, because you're being told today, and you're getting messaged from this culture, that there are some fine things that you should want to be, that there are some fine directions that you should, as a young man, want to go in.
[time=2419] That word fine means special.
[time=2422] Write it down.
[time=2423] That word fine means significant.
[time=2426] That word, that phrase, it's a fine work, eldering, it means noble, it means honorable.
[time=2432] In my terminology, it'd be huge.
[time=2438] It's just off the charts.
[time=2439] And I say this, and I just stopped for a moment, just to remind us of how true this is, because again, so many other, so many other pursuits get kind of built up as being fine, significant, special, and all that are young men, all that the men of our family would understand that there is no finer opportunity than to be a man of character, who loves, serves, and cares for the bride of Christ as an elder.
[time=2471] My son Jake is 10, he was either last night or the night
[time=2477] before, I think most of us were at the table, declared to us, as we talked about the future, that if he wasn't going to be, he really plans on it, but if he wasn't gonna be an NFL player or an NBA player, that he wanted to be a janitor.
[time=2498] Now, I don't know where your mind just went, but I'm gonna just do what I try to always do, and I just stand here and be honest with you.
[time=2508] My first thought, my first thought when he said that, wasn't so good, and I'm sorry, I really am,
[time=2519] I'm sorry that that was my first thought.
[time=2524] And I said to him, I said, "Jake, why a janitor?" He said, "Oh, Dad, that's easy." He says, "Two things." He said, "First of all, they have all the keys." (audience laughing) He said, "They can go." See, Jake's at school here at Black Hawk, and Jake is, listen, Jake is faithfully served.
[time=2547] Every day of his life, by some of the most godly men and women, Audrey, that I've ever met.
[time=2556] And he said to me, "Oh, Dad, they have all the keys.
[time=2560] They can go anywhere." And they're always helping people.
[time=2565] And I just thought, "Wow, shame on me
[time=2571] for my first thought." And I just said, "Out of boy, that's cool.
[time=2576] We'll see what God does." We are so quick to make certain things out to be not at all what they really are.
[time=2587] And I wanna remind you, whether it's a janitor or a custodian or an elder, there are some things that go into those offices.
[time=2595] There are some things about being an elder that you and I should put at the very top of our kids list.
[time=2602] It is a fine work that a man desires when what he desires is to serve and love the family of God.
[time=2612] In the New Testament, the word's bishop, elder,
[time=2618] overseer, pastor are all used interchangeably to describe the same men.
[time=2623] Some are paid to elder and lead, and some are not.
[time=2628] Some have vocations outside the four walls and yet serve the church family as elders faithfully and with great diligence.
[time=2636] Some are staff elders, if you will, who are deeply engaged on a daily basis and able to, because of their salaries and compensation, give a full-time effort to the ministry and to those who help lead it.
[time=2653] And let me just give you a few things here as we jump into the passage.
[time=2656] The elders are to be, look at verse two.
[time=2658] Here come the qualifications or qualification, I'll say, of an elder.
[time=2664] Let me explain that to you.
[time=2665] Number one, an overseer.
[time=2666] You see it there in verse two and overseer, then must be above reproach.
[time=2670] An overseer, an elder, a bishop, a pastor, must be above reproach.
[time=2675] Now, here's just a simple phrase that I think in some ways, very simply helps you understand what above reproach means what it looks like.
[time=2685] He's characterized by character.
[time=2688] This doesn't mean that he's perfect.
[time=2691] This doesn't mean that he is without fault.
[time=2694] It means that the overall pattern of his life, that in the areas of his life, that as you look at the way he lives and as you look at the way he works and as you look at the way he relates, he is characterized by the predominant overarching theme that you would get as you look at his life is he is characterized by character, by integrity.
[time=2724] It's interesting, the word does mean when you look up this word, this phrase above reproach, you do see the idea of blameless.
[time=2731] He is blameless.
[time=2735] Now, obviously, because of what we know the Bible teaches, it's clear that we will sin.
[time=2743] It's clear that we are not perfect until glory, until heaven.
[time=2748] So it certainly can't mean that he's perfect, but the idea of blamelessness is this.
[time=2753] There is no, listen, there is no overt in this man's life, there is no overt flagrant or perpetual sin that marks this man's life or character.
[time=2762] Or after all, a man who is an elder is one who you would want others to follow.
[time=2769] We don't want others to try and follow perfection.
[time=2772] We know that doesn't exist, but we would certainly want others to follow a man whose life is characterized by no overt, no flagrant or perpetual sin that marks this man's life.
[time=2785] Now, here's the interesting thing, in the Greek, when you study this passage and you come to verse two, really the way it reads is this, the qualification for a man who is aspiring to be an elder.
[time=2802] If you really just read it the way it's written is he is above reproach, period.
[time=2811] That's it.
[time=2812] That is the qualification of an elder, but it's as if, God, again, Paul, as he writes to Timothy, as all this kind of gets flushed out, it's as if he would know that they would say and you would say, well, okay, what does that look like?
[time=2829] And so then everything you see in this passage after above reproach is describing what above reproach looks like.
[time=2838] And the first thing we come to is he is the husband of one wife.
[time=2844] He is the husband of one wife.
[time=2850] Now, there have been some over the years who thought this was teaching regarding polygamy.
[time=2857] It's not about polygamy.
[time=2860] God's word clearly speaks to the issue of polygamy in a lot of other places polygamy wouldn't have been on the table.
[time=2869] Polygamy multiple wives, that's not at all what this is referring to.
[time=2875] Some have thought over the years that husband of one wife meant widowers, that men whose wives had passed away and then somehow had remarried that they were somehow disqualified by virtue of their second wife, that's not at all what this means.
[time=2893] God's word teaches in 1 Corinthians 7 and 1 Timothy 5, that the widower who remarries is okay.
[time=2900] It's a good thing.
[time=2902] He wouldn't contradict that teaching here.
[time=2905] So it's not about polygamy, it's not about widowers.
[time=2908] Some have tried to make husband of one wife about divorce and remarriage.
[time=2913] When the fact of the matter is that biblically, biblical teaching supports in a couple of instances, biblical teaching is okay with men remarrying after divorce.
[time=2923] If in fact that's done in a biblical fashion, so it's not about divorce, it's not about widowers and it's not about polygamy.
[time=2931] You know what it's about?
[time=2933] It's about you as a man.
[time=2936] Listen, being singular in your focus and your efforts
[time=2943] and your faithfulness toward the wife you have.
[time=2949] It is about absolute and total focus.
[time=2954] Your love and your devotion.
[time=2957] And I really want you to write that phrase down, singular focus, because here's the truth.
[time=2964] Here's the truth, our culture today.
[time=2967] And I know sometimes you get tired of hearing this.
[time=2969] Sometimes I get tired of saying it, but you know what, it's true.
[time=2972] It's different today than it was, you know?
[time=2975] And we've been saying that for 100 years and it's really true.
[time=2979] The more and more we develop as a culture, the sometimes the further and further away we get from the things that God designed.
[time=2986] And I want to just tell you, if I totaled up the kids in my family who are on Facebook, I think they have over 1,000 friends.
[time=2996] I'm going to let laugh about that and, oh look, I've got 400 or you've got 600.
[time=3001] But I want you to understand that suddenly what gets communicated is that I've got 1,000 friends.
[time=3009] And there was a day when growing up, when I had a buddy, I had a buddy, and we used to go shoot hoops at their park.
[time=3018] And when it came to girls, when it came to women, there was a day, some of you seeing your adults can testify to this, there was a day when you just liked, you just liked that one girl.
[time=3030] She was the only one you liked, that was it.
[time=3033] And maybe you got to be with her, and when you were with her, you were with her.
[time=3037] And a few buddies in there was a girl.
[time=3039] And our culture today says it a million times over.
[time=3044] Diversify, multiply, lots of options.
[time=3049] Just a press of a button here, just a press of a button there.
[time=3051] Goes completely against this idea of you as a man being absolutely utterly singular in your focus, your affection, your attention, your desire.
[time=3063] It was going on an Ephesus like it's going on here.
[time=3067] And he says, "A godly leader in the church, a godly man in a home will be one who with the wife that he is with will be absolutely and utterly devoted to her." I'm going to ask Corbin to come on up and to bring the team with him.
[time=3082] I want to just invite all of you to think on these things as the days go by.
[time=3089] I want to invite you to make sure you're back next week as we come back to this list of godly qualities that really help us define what a man who is above reproach, what he looks like, and how he lives, and what he values.
[time=3104] And young men, young men, I hope you'll listen.
[time=3107] Young men, I hope you'll take this to heart.
[time=3109] Hey, listen, young ladies, young ladies, 13-year-old girls,
[time=3116] 18-year-old young women, you ladies in your 20s and 30s,
[time=3122] trying to figure out what God may or may not have for you in terms of partnership and the days to come.
[time=3127] Listen, I would say it to my girls, I'll say it to you.
[time=3132] This guy, this guy is who you should be with.
[time=3138] And you shouldn't be with any other guy, but this guy.
[time=3143] Because this is a guy who honors God.
[time=3146] This is a guy whose life is marked by character and integrity.
[time=3149] Amen?
[time=3150] And then would you stand and let's sing together as we go?
[time=3163] Sing praise belongs to you, praise belongs to you, let every kingdom bow,
[time=3173] let every ocean bow, let every heart adore you in love.
[time=3181] Oh, sing, praise belongs to you.
[time=3192] What can I do but sing the greatest joy I've had
[time=3198] to lay a crown before my king?
[time=3204] Before my king, I've come to worship, I've come to lift up your name
[time=3217] for you deserve this.
[time=3219] I play down like the one that you gave.
[time=3223] I have the one voice, one heart and one sacrifice.
[time=3228] So won't you take this?
[time=3230] I play down like the one that you gave.
[time=3235] I have the one voice, one heart and one sacrifice.
[time=3241] So won't you take this?
[time=3243] I play down like the one that you gave.
[time=3245] I have the one voice, one heart and one sacrifice.
[time=3247] I play down like the one that you gave.
[time=3520] [MUSIC]
