[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - We're so thankful for all of you who've jumped in with us to experience some personal times with the Lord that are yet corporately happening all over our church family.
[time=42] It's a unique experience to know that we're fasting together and praying together and reading passages of scripture together when we only get to see one another face to face often once a week.
[time=55] You may have noticed in your preparation handouts that there's a little shadowy picture behind the words and in gray, it's a circle with some hands praying together and that symbol might be really familiar to some of you that've been around Blackhawk for a few years, but you might not understand what that represents.
[time=75] A few years ago, Kelly was preaching through the elements of following Jesus and that wasn't just a sermon series but it was something that sort of stuck with us as a foundational point of why we do what we do.
[time=89] We wanna be more like Jesus.
[time=90] We want to grow in the grace of his knowledge and we wanna be mature in Christ.
[time=96] And so we identified five different things that Jesus did that we wanna do too.
[time=101] And one of those is the symbol behind the words, that idea of prayerful abiding.
[time=107] Jesus modeled it for us and he commanded us to do it, to spend time with God the Father in order to be fruitful in what we do.
[time=116] He told us that in John chapter 15, where he likened himself to a vine and he said, "If you're not connected to me, "the vine you're gonna be fruitless." And so this preparation season is really more about being connected to him than anything else.
[time=133] We're all fasting different things.
[time=134] I'm sure you might confess like I would that you've missed a couple of 823s along the way and that's okay.
[time=140] The big point in the big picture is that we're staying connected to Jesus in the midst of it.
[time=146] And on that note, Jesus also likens himself in John chapter 10 to being a good shepherd and the people of God are his sheep.
[time=153] And Jesus says very plainly in John chapter 10, that he will speak and his sheep will immediately recognize his voice and follow.
[time=163] And so a huge prayer of mine is that this preparation season would be a chance for us to hear the voice of our good shepherd and to listen to what he has to say and to recognize his voice and to follow hard after what he asks us to do.
[time=179] Maybe you've experienced something like that with him in the last few weeks and if not, my prayers that you will in these next three.
[time=187] On the note of fasting, Elijah in 1 Kings chapter 19
[time=194] had a pretty incredible fast and Elijah actually fasted, similar to the way Jesus did, he had no food and no drink for 40 days and 40 nights and it's what they call a supernatural fast because it shouldn't have been able to happen but the spirit of God was on Elijah and he fasted for 40 days and 40 nights.
[time=213] And then what happened after his fast in 1 Kings 19, he ended up going up on a mountain, the very mountain where God gave the 10 commandments to Moses and on that mountain, he was sort of complaining to God and God said, I want to show you my presence and God did it in an unexpected way.
[time=235] And we're going to take some time this morning to think about how God might speak to you this morning in an unexpected way in the same way that he spoke to Elijah in an unexpected way.
[time=245] And my prayer for us all is that we would have ears to hear what God wants to tell us in this season of preparation.
[time=253] (dramatic music)
[time=283] (wind blowing)
[time=313] (dramatic music)
[time=404] [MUSIC - 240 seconds]
[time=658] Let's sing this song together, just make it your prayer that God would still our souls so we can hear from him.
[time=669] [MUSIC - 212 seconds]
[time=902] Lord in heaven, our prayer is that we would find the stillness in our souls
[time=910] that's often crowded by distractions, that's often crowded by the noise of life.
[time=917] God help us to find stillness of soul in order to meet you in a place of quiet,
[time=924] to meet you in a place where we can hear your whisper.
[time=929] We pray, God, and ask and that you would whisper to us in a gentle way like you did
[time=937] to Elijah and Lord that you would make it clear the things that seem fuzzy to us.
[time=942] God help us to put our hope and our trust in you and to be sheep who know the shepherd's voice
[time=950] so that when you speak and when you have a message for us to hear and understand that we
[time=956] will understand it clearly and know that it's from you. I give us the discernment required to know
[time=963] your voice and to follow hard after you got. We thank you for a season of life like this
[time=970] where we're setting aside time to prepare our hearts to know you and we pray that you would meet us in that place, God, and Lord that through our prayers and through our fasting that you
[time=981] would listen to what we as a church are asking and that you would be gracious and kind enough to speak.
[time=988] We ask this in the name of your Son Jesus. Amen.
[time=999] Well good morning everybody. We're going to be in 1 Timothy 3 again today so if you have your
[time=1013] Bibles if you'd please go there to 1 Timothy 3. This is the beginning of spring break here
[time=1019] at Blackhawk Christian School so a lot of my my friends are out of town this week to warmer
[time=1025] climates. I heard at breakfast yesterday morning that a year ago yesterday it was 82 degrees in
[time=1031] Fort Wayne. It doesn't seem possible. 82 seems a long way off but we're trying to coax spring out
[time=1038] here. The buds in my garden are trying to get up through the ground. They're just feebly hanging on to life so we're ready for spring. Amen. It's been a long winter. I'm grateful to live in a place
[time=1051] where I can long for for springtime having had that long winter of waiting. First Timothy 3 we're
[time=1059] going to read the first seven verses. Kelly took us the first little bit here last week. I'm going to finish it up this morning. I want to encourage you this morning with a couple of things right
[time=1069] off of that. The message is called God's God parents for this reason. I think that what we heard last
[time=1079] week about God's perspective for his people that these are the kind of men that God has in mind to
[time=1087] take care of his children while he is away. Now we know very well that God isn't really away.
[time=1094] He is very present. A very present help and trouble and all the songs that we sang this morning I think sing that message out to us and remind us of it very powerfully. But I am persuaded that
[time=1105] is exactly what he's doing in 1 Timothy 3 1 through 7. He's describing the kind of people to whom he
[time=1112] would entrust his kids in his absence. Are you not overwhelmingly grateful that one day the words of
[time=1120] that him be still my soul will be our experience that will be with him face to face. Aren't you
[time=1126] incredibly glad about that this morning? Until that day, until that day he says I my children
[time=1136] need to be cared for and I am entrusting them to these kinds of men. In honor of God's where would
[time=1143] you please stand? We're going to read the first seven verses of 1 Timothy 3.
[time=1150] "The saying is trustworthy. If anyone aspires, if anyone reaches out to the office of overseer,
[time=1162] he desires a noble task. Therefore, an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife,
[time=1168] sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach. Not a drunkard,
[time=1178] not violent, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He must manage his own
[time=1185] household well with all dignity keeping his children submissive. For someone does not know
[time=1192] how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's church? He must not be a recent
[time=1198] convert or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil.
[time=1205] Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders so that he may not fall into disgrace
[time=1211] into a snare of the devil." Would you pray with me?
[time=1216] Father, even if that was the first time we read this passage, we would be struck by the seriousness
[time=1228] of it. Your very specific father about the kind of men that you design to care and to
[time=1237] spiritually father your people. You have told us in your word that if that does not go well both
[time=1245] inside and outside the church, there are some pretty disastrous consequences. So would you help us, Father, to navigate this passage well, would you please help us to be obedient to it, to seek after it, to aspire to these things, to reach out for them? I thank you, Father, for
[time=1264] your love and that every word that we sang this morning is true. I'm grateful for our time together.
[time=1275] Please be with us and open our hearts and our eyes and our ears to receive your word today.
[time=1280] I pray all this in Jesus' name. Amen. That song that Lindsey's saying just a few minutes ago is from
[time=1287] Augustine's Confessions about man's soul is restless till it finds its rest in him. What a
[time=1294] beautiful reminder that was. Verse 1, let's take a look at that together. The elder's character is,
[time=1302] there are notes in your bulletins. You're welcome to follow along. The elder's character is Roman numeral one on your outline, his character. I think there's a real sense in here of who the elder is
[time=1312] within and who he is without. That is the kind of man he is within himself and the way that other
[time=1319] people see him and interact with him. Let's kind of walk through that together. Some of this was we broached this last week. Verse 1, the saying is trustworthy. If anyone aspires, again, that's
[time=1331] exactly what the word means. It means to reach out. If anyone aspires to the office of overseer,
[time=1337] he desires a noble task. The ESV and NIB say noble task. The NASB that Kelly read from last week
[time=1346] says a fine work. The new living translation says an honorable position. So you get a sense of what's
[time=1353] going on. It's a very good thing to reach out and aspire to this office. Let me say this right up
[time=1362] front. We are in a season of offering up names of men to serve this church in this capacity. And if
[time=1370] you haven't, if as we're going through this list today, I would pray, if someone comes to your mind that fits this description, that could serve this church in that way, would you please let
[time=1381] the welcome center know that you are putting that name forward? We need these kinds of men in every
[time=1388] church to serve and we need them. This is the season that we're doing it right now. So what a perfect opportunity for us to walk you through what kind of man this should be. If a name comes to your mind, that's exactly what he's like. He's like all of these things that we're going to read together this morning. Then please put his name forward. Please volunteer him. And men, if you
[time=1408] feel that before God by his grace, that this is the kind of person that you are and you are willing to serve, you can put your name forward too. There's no hubris or pride in that. Don't be shy.
[time=1416] It's a noble task, a fine work, an honorable position. Letter A in your outline there is his
[time=1425] disposition. It's his who he is in himself, his disposition, what he is known for, I guess,
[time=1433] to himself. Titus chapter one is the other place in the New Testament where we see a description of
[time=1440] elders. Would you go there please? First and second Timothy in your Bibles is followed by Titus so
[time=1447] that they're bunched together. In the pastoral letters, Paul writes this letter of Titus to a young
[time=1453] pastor on the island of Crete who is also in need of instruction. Please notice the first things
[time=1459] that he says to Titus in chapter one and verse five. And you'll see lots of overlapping here.
[time=1467] That's on purpose. This is why I left you in Crete so that you might put what remained into
[time=1474] order and to appoint elders in every town as I directed you. The first thing Paul does is say
[time=1484] Titus need to get order in your church, in your assembly. And the way that you do that is by appointing
[time=1490] elders. Serving in the church has never been and must not ever be a lone ranger operation.
[time=1499] I am delighted to tell you that Kelly is not that kind of a person. Kelly has zero lone ranger
[time=1506] mentality about him. He desires and he longs after community of people around him to help
[time=1513] him serve this place as well as we can. So I would encourage you to rejoice that there's none of
[time=1519] that in him. He understands the need for elders to protect and to guide and to lead.
[time=1524] Let's keep reading. If anyone is above approach, verse six, Titus one, husband of one wife and his
[time=1532] children are believers and not up into the charge of debauchery. Debauchery is a sense of a life
[time=1538] it's not in balance in any way or in subordination. For an overseer as God's steward
[time=1544] must be above approach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or drunkard or violent or greedy for gain but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.
[time=1555] He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction
[time=1562] and sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it more on that later.
[time=1567] File that one away. There are requirements for this person as elder and for his family.
[time=1573] You will notice the list is a long list of qualities about these kinds of men. It's a long
[time=1580] list that leads to a short list. There aren't hundreds of guys in any church who fit this
[time=1586] description. It's a very exclusive thing on purpose. Why? Because God is a good father.
[time=1595] Because God is a compassionate and gracious and overwhelmingly loving father and so he wants to entrust his kids to certain kinds of men. He's very deliberate about it. He's very careful about it
[time=1607] as any father would be who is passing off the scene and has kids that need to be cared for.
[time=1612] I hope this morning is worshipful for you on that score. What kind of a God we serve
[time=1620] that loves us like this, that he would entrust us to these kinds of men.
[time=1625] It says in verse two there that the overseer must be above reproach. There's nothing in his life
[time=1633] that causes people in the church to think badly people in or out of the church think badly about the church or about what the church is teaching. Irapproachable. Nothing bad can be said. It's
[time=1646] only used three times in the Holy Testament, this word. It's also used by the way of widows in 1 Timothy 5 verse 7. These are not lists, friends, that merely a certain kind of man should
[time=1658] aspire to. These words are used of all kinds of people. Young women, old women, young men,
[time=1664] old men. These are not just for them, but there are particularly designed here for this office.
[time=1670] He is the husband of one wife. Go over to 1 Timothy 5 verse 9.
[time=1674] Kelly told you last week that what that phrase meant and how we hold to it here.
[time=1680] I'm going to give you some more information about why I think that his expression there, that it's a man who is singularly devoted to his wife is the right way to read that passage.
[time=1691] Look at 1 Timothy 5 verse 9. Let a widow be enrolled that is to get help from the church.
[time=1696] If she is not less than 60 years of age, having been the wife of one husband, a woman of one man. So the sense in 1 Timothy 3 is like that phrase. This is a one woman kind of man.
[time=1710] There are all kinds of ways to read the passage that I think is the most faithful to the text,
[time=1716] because the 1 Timothy 5, 9 verse seems to go very carefully with that. This is a one woman
[time=1722] kind of man, a man who is singularly devoted to his wife. He is, to continue in verse 2,
[time=1728] sober minded says the ESV, sober minded. He has a restraint about him. There's a lot of words that
[time=1736] kind of come cascading here together. I think friends that words matter and so I want to walk into these words and why I think they matter here. By the way, this word sober minded is used down
[time=1747] the passage in verse 11. Go ahead to verse 11 of 1 Timothy 3. This passage, this word is used of
[time=1754] the wives of deacons. So again, not exclusive to these men. These are qualities and these are
[time=1761] character issues that apply to each person in the church, even the wives of deacons here.
[time=1767] This person exercises self-control and is in charge of his appetites. He is in control. He's
[time=1775] temperate. That's the word that's often used. He's temperate. He's not given to fits of passions.
[time=1780] The next word there in the ESV is sober minded is self-controlled, sensible. It's used by the
[time=1787] way of younger women in Titus 2.5. There is nobody, if you are a young woman in the room today,
[time=1795] or an older woman, if you are a young man, this is maybe about you. The passage isn't directly
[time=1803] speaking to you. There's nobody for whom this passage isn't intended. I was talking to one of my students this past week. I was walking through study hall and she said something like, "That boys are dumb." I said, "Yeah, they can sometimes be dumb." That's true. Boys can be dumb.
[time=1817] I don't think boys have the market on dumbness though. I think girls can be dumb sometimes too.
[time=1821] Anyway, she's 17. Boys are dumb. Boys can be very dumb at 17. I'm as this former 17-year-old. I can
[time=1828] say that with conviction. I said to her, "You know what kind of guy you should be looking for?
[time=1834] I'm just echoing Kelly's words last week. Look for this kind of a guy. That's the kind of guy you should be looking for. Even if you're not aspiring to the office of overseer, there's nobody that this passage isn't intended for. It's God's word. It's there for us anyway.
[time=1850] So you see that young men, old men, young women, old women, this is all for each one of us, each one of us for different reasons granted, but it's there. They're sensible. They're prudent.
[time=1861] They're thoughtful. Keep going. Respectable. Respectable is
[time=1867] well-arranged. He's seemingly. There's something about this person
[time=1874] that again, nothing's in the way. People hold him in high regard. Let me read this to you.
[time=1881] Having characteristics or qualities that evoke admiration or delight.
[time=1886] Hope names are coming to your mind. The names of the men who currently sit in our elder board
[time=1895] definitely come to mind for me, and I'm very thankful for them. These are the qualities that
[time=1901] these men should possess. Keep going, it says, and the next word is hospitable.
[time=1907] Hospitable. Here's how I would explain it. An elder's posture should not be one of this.
[time=1914] Strangers. I don't know you. The elder's posture should be one of this. He's open and welcoming
[time=1923] to strangers. People who come into the church who are new should be made to feel welcome
[time=1929] by the kind of people that we are. And elders should, I think, be that par excellence.
[time=1935] They should be first in line. Kind, open, welcoming, not a secretive person. He isn't like this.
[time=1942] He's a person that will let others in. I think about Christ's example in that way.
[time=1947] He is, here we go, the last phrase, the last word, actually, verse two is able
[time=1955] to teach. That does not mean what's going on right now. It can mean that, but doesn't have to
[time=1961] mean that. What it means is, it means like what bank tellers do. I like this. This is a great
[time=1967] analogy. So if I've used it before, forgive me. Okay. Bank tellers don't study fake bills.
[time=1973] That's a fake. Got it. That's a fake. Got it. The real thing every day, all the time,
[time=1979] every day, all the time. So, when a fake one comes across their desk, they're like, got it. That's a fake. They know the real thing so very well. Titus 1 says this also.
[time=1991] Remember the strange and diverse teachings? You'll know it when you see it. That's the point.
[time=1995] This is a person who is understanding about what is true. And when he sees or hears falsehood, he's like, that's not right. He's able to tell other people what is true. Not like this,
[time=2006] in this context, but in general, he can explain to somebody else, you know, that's not right.
[time=2012] Here's what God says about this. There's a discernment about him.
[time=2015] And on that score, being able to teach, I wanted to ask you to take out this insert
[time=2021] in your bulletin. Awesome segue there. Here's this handout in your bulletin. We, Kelly,
[time=2029] last year, led us through a series of messages called Grow or Die. And in the days following
[time=2037] that, we felt responsible as spiritual parents to you to give you opportunities to grow
[time=2044] and to follow him in this way. So we have three courses, if you will, or opportunities for you
[time=2050] starting on April 21st, the Thursday night, it's April 21st, 28th, and then the first three
[time=2056] Thursdays in the month of May. And three of my dear friends are teaching the courses. Jason Thompson is going to lead us through a course on sanctification through the five elements, one of which Corbin mentioned a few minutes ago, prayerful abiding. The five elements of what it means to
[time=2070] be disciple, he's going to use that lens to kind of walk us through. How is it that God makes a person holy? Josh rang loose through a series of five weeks about how to read the Bible, how to
[time=2080] study it, why it matters. Very excited about that. And Rick Raybur will lead us through a series of five messages or five evenings on the Holy Spirit whom Francis Chan has called in recent days.
[time=2092] In a great book, I recommend to you highly called Forgotten God. You can sign up online. You can
[time=2098] sign up with this little insert in the bulletin. Please give it to a greeter on the way out. You can leave it at the welcome center. There's opportunities again on the site, blackhockministries.org, or by just tearing off this piece of paper and giving it to a greeter on your way out or dropping off at the welcome center. I would just encourage you that you can be involved in this
[time=2117] able to teach process. Here's how. By knowing what is true, you can recognize what is false.
[time=2124] Everyone is not, there's no one who doesn't mean from that either. So we're all involved in that together. So verse two, we have this person's disposition. This is kind of who he is. He's defined
[time=2137] by these things. Now in verse three, we have a transition. The word not, look at verse three,
[time=2144] the word not shows up there many, many times. So the elder is defined by what he does and what he
[time=2150] doesn't do. Friends, I am concerned, and I've mentioned this to you before, I'm sure, that we,
[time=2157] that Christians are in danger often of being content to be defined by what we don't do.
[time=2165] Well, I'm a Christian. I don't do that, that and that, and that's pretty much it.
[time=2172] There is a place for keeping myself unstained from the world. There's a place for that,
[time=2179] and it's very, very necessary for our witness. And I understand that's absolutely true. I agree with it wholeheartedly, but there's another step. There's a negative and a positive here.
[time=2189] Verse two has, he's known by this and this and this. He's known because I see it, not only by what he avoids, but what he doesn't do, but by what he does. And there's both. So there's a two-handedness,
[time=2200] not just by what he doesn't do, but by what he does as well. Here, in verse three is what he doesn't
[time=2206] do. I would encourage you to us to never be one-handed kinds of people on that score.
[time=2212] So to let her be there is his behavior, his behavior. There was a disposition, let her be as his behavior. Not a drunkard. Not a drunkard. There is a particular danger,
[time=2226] it seems here of addiction on that score. But this really goes in the next few phrases,
[time=2234] make this clear as well. This person's lifestyle is characterized by self-control and measured
[time=2240] ness. He's not mastered by anything. He is in control of every one of his appetites,
[time=2246] appetites to drink and all the rest of it. Not only drunkenness. This is a sense of, he has mastery over all the things. Not only just strong drink. Not violent, but gentle.
[time=2260] The word for not violent there is the word that we would say is bully. He's not a bully.
[time=2264] That came me with someone's fist, but it could also mean with their words. We can bully people with things that we say as well. Others say he's not pugnacious. Pugnacious reminds me of a boxer.
[time=2278] He isn't given to fighting. He's not looking for a fight. Not violent, but gentle. He's not a bully.
[time=2286] His temper is under control. Again, he has a sense. He's bent toward having
[time=2292] conciliatory bent. What does that mean? It means that he's eager to solve disagreements.
[time=2299] That's conciliatory. It means when we have a disagreement, I want to make it right.
[time=2305] He's not content to just be going on at all the time. That's not what he wants.
[time=2308] There's a yielding. He's gentle. He's going to not insist on his way.
[time=2314] On the first screen, the 2013, doesn't it? It doesn't insist on its own way.
[time=2318] It's interesting this word for gentle is often used of somebody who doesn't insist on every
[time=2327] letter. Here's this. I want this. I want this. I want this. It says it. I want it.
[time=2334] Doesn't have to get his way. He's gentle. Not violent, but gentle. It keeps going in verse three,
[time=2341] not quarrelsome. This is a person who is peaceable. He's not looking for a fight.
[time=2347] And he doesn't need to be right all the time either. And husbands, I would advise you as a
[time=2353] husband to be mindful of that. That there is a great danger that we have as men, especially as men,
[time=2360] to always be right all the time. And can I encourage you on this score that Paul is calling people, men, to be recognized as people that don't always have to be right all the time.
[time=2371] Not quarrelsome. Not quarrelsome. This is very interesting to me because the next verse is talked about his house. His kids are in submission to him as the father, but yet he's this kind of gentle person. So he has a firm, but gentle hand. That's hard.
[time=2387] Again, this is not a long list of people. It's a short list of people with a long list of qualities about them. It's very interesting, isn't it? He's not quarrelsome. He's not violent, but gentle,
[time=2398] but yet he keeps a firm hand on his house. Verses four and five will jump in here. But before
[time=2406] he go to verse four, look at the last thing it says in verse three, not a lover of money.
[time=2411] There's a reference there in your notes for Hebrews 13 to describe some leadership there.
[time=2416] And it also mentions a lover of money there too. It's mentioned again in first Timothy 6, verse 10, coming up in a few pages. So this is a unique struggle. It's a unique trap. Write that
[time=2427] down, please, on your notes. This lover of money is mentioned three times in these contexts.
[time=2433] There's some sense of it. And haven't we all seen it in pastors? This trap's being laid for pastors,
[time=2439] especially for pastors, to love money. We're going to come on that too. Roman
[time=2447] Hebrew 2 in your notes is the elders care. The elders care how he cares for his house,
[time=2454] letter A, and how he cares for the church, letter B. So the elders care his
[time=2460] protection, his guardianship of the house and of the church. Verse four, he must manage his own
[time=2469] household well with all dignity keeping his children submissive. There's, again,
[time=2476] it's a reference there in your notes. First Corinthians chapter four, you can go to the left in your New Testament after Acts in Romans, his first Corinthians. It's before 2 Corinthians. That would
[time=2488] be helpful to you. You guys there? Okay. First Corinthians chapter four, verses 14 through 17.
[time=2494] Here we go. I think the idea of God, spiritual God parenting is exactly right. And here's why I
[time=2501] think it because of what Paul says in these verses. The elders function as spiritual parents to people.
[time=2509] I do not write these things to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
[time=2517] For though you have countless guides in Christ, you don't have many fathers.
[time=2525] Longlist, shortlist, countless guides, not many fathers. I became your father in Christ Jesus
[time=2534] through the gospel. I urge you then, the imitators of me. That's why I sent you Timothy, the very same Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. Spiritual parenting is very
[time=2547] much in view, friends. It's what this looks like. It looks like a parent who admonishes a child.
[time=2555] A guy who has his household in order. Management of the house falls to these kinds of men.
[time=2562] And then go also to 1 Thessalonians 2. Thessalonians is right before Timothy. 1 Thessalonians 2 verses 11 and 12.
[time=2572] We're making a case here. For you know how verse 11, like a father with his children,
[time=2582] we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you to walk in a manner worthy of God
[time=2589] who calls you into his own kingdom and glory. Did you see that in those verses, there are some
[time=2595] things assumed about fathers and what they do. Fathers encourage, fathers exhort, fathers charge,
[time=2604] fathers admonish. So Kelly's reminder in recent weeks that men who are disengaged and aloof and
[time=2615] who'd rather watch the game on the couch. That's not the picture of fatherhood that he gives in the New Testament. So men, there are real and serious calls here for us to get to it. The business
[time=2631] of fathering, it's important. It's one of the most important roles you will ever serve in your life.
[time=2637] He must manage his own household well with all dignity keeping his children submissive. I have
[time=2644] some questions to ask. Before I ask the questions, I think how that looks in your house may not be
[time=2651] how it looks in my house or vice versa. The way that your house works will vary from place to place.
[time=2656] Let's be clear about that. But that this is going on should be unmistakable.
[time=2661] How that happens, it will be different because you are made to different kinds of people.
[time=2666] But some questions. Men, do you insist that your children are obedient to you and to their mother
[time=2675] or is it a matter of convenience? The most loving thing that you can do for your kids is to insist
[time=2684] that they be obedient to you and to their mother. That's the most loving thing that you can do for them. It's not loving to let them do whatever they want to do. It's not loving.
[time=2694] It's not managing your household well. When you have struggles on that score, nobody is perfect.
[time=2700] The call isn't a perfection. The call is to doing what he's called you to do.
[time=2704] And on that score, we all need help once in a while. That's why we're part of the family, the family of God in this place. Sometimes kids do things they shouldn't do.
[time=2715] But it's important that you see their obedience to you as connected to their obedience to God as father. You are modeling for them what God as a father should be like. And that's why a lot of
[time=2726] people have a hard time with God as father because their dads weren't so good at that.
[time=2732] That's a responsibility that these people have. Do you understand that an out of control house
[time=2740] all the time? There are times. Okay, we get it. There are times things will go badly. That's not what we're saying here. But an out of control house for years and years and years is a bad witness. It does not make the gospel look precious. And I am not saying to any one of you that your
[time=2756] kids will never disobey you. And if they do, then you're out. It's not God's heart. It's not my heart certainly. Just hang up my house for a couple hours and you'll see that this is not always the case within our four walls. But obedience isn't a suggestion.
[time=2771] It's not if you get around to it or if it's convenient to me, you should obey me. It's not like that at all. Make sure that your kids, husbands, and wives, mothers and fathers, make sure that your kids know what it means to be obedient to you and to be consistent.
[time=2787] Sometimes my kids do that thing where they play each other. They play Jodi on off each other.
[time=2791] The last Jodi and she'll say, no. And it comes to me and I'll say, yeah, okay, sure. What just
[time=2797] happened there? I got, she pulled a fast one. She's eight. She pulled a fast one on me. They'll do that. That's why it's important to keep close accounts with your spouse. So you're not giving
[time=2808] mixed messages. Don't give your kids mixed messages. Don't do that. Make it easy for them to be obedient to you. And likewise, children understand that God's will is for you is to be obedient. Make it
[time=2820] easy for them to lead you. Don't be the kind of chomping at the bit all the time. And you're always asking questions and you're always defying. Be careful. His care of his house,
[time=2832] his care of the church, letter B, letter B. Look at Acts chapter 20. This is something we read
[time=2840] last week. We jumped into it a little bit here. Acts 20 and Acts is right after the gospel of John and right before the letter, Paul is out of the Romans. Acts 20, 28.
[time=2849] Again, listen to these words. He's addressing here the Ephesian elders. It seems entirely
[time=2860] appropriate to read this to you again. Be careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock in
[time=2866] which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood. I know that after my departure, fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing
[time=2877] the flock. And from among your own selves will rise men speaking twisted things to draw away the
[time=2883] disciples after them, therefore be alert men. Remembering that for three years, I didn't cease
[time=2893] night or day to admonish everyone with tears. This is serious. There's threats, real threats.
[time=2902] Roman numeral three in your outline is the elders' consequences. We'll just go right there together.
[time=2907] The elders. Number one is the elders' character. Number two is the elders' care or guidance or
[time=2914] protection of his house and of the church. And three there is the elders' consequences. Let me explain. Verse six of 1 Timothy 3. You can go back to 1 Timothy 3 if you would. He must not be a
[time=2926] recent convert. The word in the Greek is literally like what we would call a newbie. He's not a,
[time=2933] he's not a neo-fight is the word, but that would mean newbie to us. He's not new on the scene.
[time=2938] Have we not seen the disastrous consequences when recent converts get put on magazine covers.
[time=2947] And they're propped up as celebrities come through to Christ and all of a sudden they're the ones that we go to. And it says in this verse, don't do that. Why? Or they may become puffed up with
[time=2960] conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil. Inside the church, there are very real
[time=2968] needs to be careful inside the church. There are two things I would notice about the end of verse
[time=2975] six. Number one, the devil is going to be condemned. He's going to be judged by a judge. So number one,
[time=2983] the devil is real and he'll be judged by someone by the Lord who is sovereign. So I would notice both
[time=2990] those things with you that you should draw attention to. There is a God and there is a devil and the
[time=2996] God will one day hold that devil who opposes the church. He'll hold him to account. He will judge
[time=3003] him. There's a legal decision that will be rendered by him and it will not be good for the devil.
[time=3008] He will answer for what he's done and he is real and acting like he's not is dangerous.
[time=3014] God is sovereign and he will judge the one that we call the devil who is actively
[time=3022] seeking to devour folks in and out of the church. So number number B, letter B there,
[time=3029] an outline is outside the church. A was inside, B is outside. He tells Timothy elsewhere in 2 Timothy
[time=3036] 2, "Flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, along with those who call
[time=3043] on the Lord from a pure heart." People outside the church must speak well of this kind of person.
[time=3050] Look what it says in verse seven. Moreover, he must be well found out by outsiders so that he
[time=3057] may not fall into disgrace into a trap or snare of the devil. I would just notice a few things here.
[time=3066] First of all, he's known to outsiders. So he's not just, again, he's not this kind of a guy, this kind of a guy. He's a guy that's known to people. He's not secretive with his life. He's
[time=3078] engaged by the way. That's the best way to share the gospel is to know people that don't know him.
[time=3087] Get to know them. These kind of people do. And it says there that they give a good testimony
[time=3093] about him. What's he like? Oh, he's this kind of a guy. That will make it much easier for them to
[time=3099] receive the good news from you, by the way. Not all that guy? Nah. The devil is opposed to the
[time=3109] efforts of men in the church to lead well and will actively oppose them by laying traps, it says traps like loving money, traps like arrogance, traps like a bad reputation.
[time=3121] Consequences. There are serious and real consequences. So acting like this is not a big deal, and Paul
[time=3130] is very careful about this in the passage. Like it's not a big deal, I think, is foolish, friends.
[time=3136] The elders' character, he's a certain kind of man in here and out here. The way he cares for
[time=3142] his house, and the way he cares for the church, it matters. And as Corbin and the team come up to allow us to respond this morning, the elders' consequences are very, very serious, both in and
[time=3153] without of the church. Very, very serious. It's important that we respond rightly to these things,
[time=3160] friends. And here's what I would say. We're going to sing a song together. I always love to do that.
[time=3166] I always love to respond in that way. And here's what we're going to say. And here's why we're going to say it. I will bless the Lord forever. I will trust him at all times. He has delivered me
[time=3177] from all fear. He has set my feet on a rock. I will not be moved, and I'll say the Lord,
[time=3183] you are my shield, my strength, my portion, my deliverer, my shelter, my strong tower, my very present help and time of need. Why can I say that?
[time=3193] After this, because God cares about his church. He cares about his children.
[time=3198] These men are the living example of this is true. So I would encourage you to sing,
[time=3206] to sing with a full heart, with gratitude for what he's done, and for why he's done it this morning.
[time=3218] Stay in together and sing this.
[time=3248] He has delivered me from all fear. He has set my feet on a rock.
[time=3263] Oh, and I will not be moved, and I'll say of the Lord,
[time=3277] you are my shield, my strength, my portion, my deliverer, my shelter, my strong tower,
[time=3296] my very present help and time of need.
[time=3306] Whom a violin heaven but you?
[time=3312] Whom hell I can heaven but you?
[time=3326] There's none I desire beside you.
[time=3335] Oh, when you have made me bend, and I'll say of the Lord,
[time=3346] you are my shield, my strength, my portion, deliverer, my shelter,
[time=3362] strong tower, my very present help and time of need.
[time=3381] You are my shield, my shelter, my shelter, my shelter,
[time=3404] same. You have made me glad, and I'll say of the Lord, you are my shield, my strength, my portion,
[time=3424] deliverer, my shelter, my strong tower, my very present help.
[time=3437] You are my shield, my strength, my portion, deliverer, my shelter,
[time=3452] strong tower, my very present help, you are my shield, my strength, my portion, deliverer, my shelter,
[time=3474] strong tower, my very present help and time of need.
