[time=392] Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount, that we're to shine our light.
[time=397] He said just like a city on a hill can't be hidden, so when the people of God do good deeds, the light of that will not be hidden either.
[time=406] This is when people see our good deeds as a church.
[time=410] They will look at those deeds and give glory to their Father in Heaven.
[time=415] It's important for us to remember that it isn't just our deeds that make that happen, it isn't just our deeds that make light to shine.
[time=423] Because I can Corinthians tells us that it's actually God who illuminates our hearts so that we can shine light.
[time=430] So I can grin and say that the same God who spoke and said let there be light is the God that shines in our hearts the light of the knowledge of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[time=441] So we're going to sing together a prayer this morning that God would shine brighter in our hearts today
[time=447] so that we could shine greater light into the world around us.
[time=451] Let's sing this prayer together.
[time=453] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 42 seconds]
[time=507] (upbeat music) God, we know that it's you called light out of darkness and we pray that you
[time=518] who shines great light in this world that would shine in our hearts today God.
[time=523] And that you give us ample opportunity to be a people of good deeds.
[time=528] Shine your light into the world around us like a city on a hill.
[time=532] And we pray, God, that many people would glorify you in heaven because of it in Jesus' name.

[time=787] Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour. As most of you watch this taping it is the 17th of April which means we are one week away from the
[time=799] greatest celebration that we at Black Hawk and those in the church today get to celebrate and that is the great celebration of the resurrection. That's right Easter is next Sunday the 24th of April and I want to do what I've done for years with those of you in our viewing audience and I do this with great anticipation and with great hope. I want to invite you to come and be with us in person next Sunday morning at either service at 9 or 1045 and I do
[time=828] that because I know this about so many of you in our viewing audience. I know many of you watch the Bible Hour and have church homes. You watch as I hear many of you say you watch while you're getting ready and that's a good thing and our hope for you is that as you watch next week and go and celebrate the great
[time=847] truth the great life giving eternity altering truth of the resurrection our hope is that you enjoy that and that God will bless you and those you're with in your church whatever church that might be wherever that church is but I know that there are literally thousands of you who watch every week and you don't have a church home. I mean a building to go to and a family to kind of
[time=871] call home and we want you to know that next Sunday on Easter the 24th we would love for you to come and be with us. You may have been watching now for six months you may have been watching for a couple of years. I met someone about a month ago here in our services who've been watching for five years and I don't understand all that works. I trust that God works and moves in people's hearts and brings them to places where they're ready for a next step and so we're just trusting God that you would consider coming whoever you are wherever you've been whatever your life looks like whatever circumstances you find yourself in the midst of we want to invite you. I would love to meet you and have you with our family on Easter next Sunday so come and be a part of the great celebration with us 9 and 10 45 you can go to our website during the week and find other information about other ministries that are offered on Sunday mornings for kids and for students we would love to have you with us.

I hope if you come you'll stick around after a service and come down front. I'd love to say hello to you. I'd love to put a name with a face and I'd love to introduce you to some more people in the Blackhawk family who maybe could help you transition from being a Bible Hour viewer to a regular every week Blackhawk member. Thank you for this time. I hope you have a great week and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=978] You could be a tragedy for me to turn away.
[time=987] All my needs you have survived when I was dead. You gave me life. How could I not
[time=1001] give it away so freely? And I'll follow you to the horns of the broken. I'll follow you
[time=1017] into the world. I'll meet the needs for the poor and the needy God. I'll follow you
[time=1028] into the world. Use my hands. Use my feet to make your kingdom come. To the corners
[time=1045] of the earth until your work is done. Yeah. His faith without works is dead and on
[time=1059] the cross no blood was shed. So how could we not give it away so freely? Yeah.
[time=1074] And I'll follow you into the horns of the broken. I'll follow you into the world. I'll meet the
[time=1087] needs for the poor and the needy God. I'll follow you into the world. Yeah. I'll follow you into the
[time=1099] horns of the broken. I'll follow you into the world. I'll meet the needs for the poor and
[time=1111] the needy God. I'll follow you into the world. I give all myself. I give all myself. I give
[time=1125] all myself. I give all myself to you. Oh, and I'll give all myself. Yes, I give all myself.
[time=1149] Yes, I give all myself to you. I'll follow you into the horns of the broken. I'll follow you into the
[time=1170] horns of the broken. I'll follow you into the world. I'll follow you into the horns of the broken.
[time=1189] I'll follow you into the world. I'll meet the needs for the poor and the needy God.
[time=1208] Well, hey, let me invite you, if you would, to please open your Bibles to 1 Timothy. First
[time=1214] Timothy chapter three and our ongoing series that we've entitled True Church, God's Design for the
[time=1221] Body. God's Design and God's Desire for the Body of Christ, what it's to look like, how it's to
[time=1228] function, how it's to be put together. God goes to great lengths through the pen of Paul as he writes
[time=1234] to his true child in the faith, Timothy. And we've been having a fruitful, encouraging study as we've
[time=1242] made our way through these first couple, two, three chapters. And I want to say thank you to Steve Webster, who was here in my place last week, so thankful for the teaching that Steve brought, so grateful for the time it allowed me and my family to be away for a few days. And it's good to be back
[time=1257] in 1 Timothy 3. Great to be back here with you. And I look forward to what God's going to teach us
[time=1264] and show us this morning in 1 Timothy 3 verses 8 to 13. Now, before we jump in
[time=1270] to the passage, let me say something to you this morning about the context of the passage.
[time=1280] Let me say something to you again about the setting of this book. I've told you for years that you
[time=1286] always want to read the Bible. We always want to study God's Word, understanding the context
[time=1292] within which it was written. What was going on in the literal setting that the verse, that the passage,
[time=1300] that the book was being written to. And I want to say something to you this morning about the setting that Timothy finds himself in, the context that this young church there in Ephesus found itself
[time=1311] in there at Ephesus. And I also want to say something to you about the relevance and the usefulness
[time=1319] of this topic, of this passage. But let's first start with the context. Let's first start with
[time=1326] the setting. We have just spent, listen, we've just spent two weeks and we're about to spend a third.
[time=1334] We've just spent two whole weeks and we're about to spend a third studying in a very careful and
[time=1341] in-depth fashion, God's design for church leadership. God's blueprint, if you will. God's desire
[time=1348] for the church to be loved and led by high integrity elders, high character, respectable,
[time=1359] faithful, high caliber men who love God deeply, love their wives and families deeply, and care
[time=1366] for the church and its mission of making disciples with great passion and with great diligence. And that's all good. It's been a great reminder to many of us. It's been a great
[time=1378] inspiration to others. It's been good for us to look at that over these weeks. But let me just
[time=1384] stop and ask you this question. Have you ever stopped and wondered why? I've had a few conversations
[time=1391] in recent weeks with those who have wondered why a whole chapter is given to this one topic of
[time=1401] church leadership. It's not a very lengthy book. And yet as you study 1 Timothy, you come to chapter
[time=1407] three and the entire chapter, word for word, deals with this issue of the quality and the
[time=1414] character of those who will lead the church. And this is where I want to just remind you this
[time=1420] morning about context. I want to remind you this morning about the setting within which this actual
[time=1427] letter was received by Timothy and those in the church at Ephesus. And I'll say it to you this way.
[time=1435] The moral, the moral, ethical, political, personal culture in Ephesus. In this day, when this
[time=1450] letter is received, the moral, ethical, political, personal, culture in Ephesus was as depraved.
[time=1458] It was as dark. It was as evil and as twisted as you could possibly imagine.
[time=1464] Don't even try to imagine. I don't even want you to go there. The culture of that day in that place
[time=1472] was that seedy. It was bad. I've told you before, when we studied the book of Ephesus, I told you
[time=1478] that Ephesus itself was Vegas, New York City, in Washington, D.C. The worst parts of all three
[time=1484] combined into one was dark. Really, really dark. And what you have to remember is that the church
[time=1493] in Ephesus is still very new at this point. The church in Ephesus is still very young.
[time=1498] Timothy, its leader is still very young. The church is young and impressionable and Timothy
[time=1505] is young and impressionable. And they find themselves in this context of dark and moral
[time=1511] seedy, unbelievably depraved Ephesus. And I want you to think about this. Listen,
[time=1521] I've always said this. I think I'll just keep saying this for years. In the absence of conviction and principle. And you can think about this with regard to a church. You can think about this with
[time=1532] regard to a pastor. You can think about this with regard to your kids. You can think about this
[time=1539] with regard to family. Listen, in the absence of conviction and principle, the church will always
[time=1548] drift toward culture. In the absence of clear principle and conviction, kids will always drift
[time=1557] toward culture. In the absence of clear conviction and principle, relationships and organizations,
[time=1564] it's just the way we are as humans. We just drift toward what's popular. We just drift toward what's
[time=1571] seemingly relevant. In Ephesus, if the church was to drift, Paul knew this. If the church was
[time=1584] to drift toward culture, then the church would be influenced by culture. And eventually,
[time=1591] once you're influenced by culture, and once that influencing goes on long enough, it's only
[time=1597] inevitable that you will be at some point in time controlled by culture. And once that happens,
[time=1605] once you've drifted toward culture, once you've been influenced by culture, once you become controlled by culture, God's divine. And if we're talking about the church, then God's divine tool is bride, the church designed by God to transform culture. And I got to stop
[time=1626] right there and just say, think about that. Think about that statement, because sometimes we get
[time=1632] so caught up as the church and just trying to survive culture. Amen? That we forget that God's
[time=1642] design for the body of Christ, we're supposed to be transforming with the gospel deeply and firmly
[time=1652] planted in your hearts and souls and mind. We're supposed to be, the church is supposed to be transforming culture. I don't think it's going so well. I'm thankful for some strides and I'm
[time=1665] grateful for some impact we get to have. But I just want you to think about that phraseology.
[time=1669] We're supposed to be transforming our culture. But see, if the church were to drift toward culture,
[time=1678] be influenced by culture and inevitably controlled by culture, then God's designed for the church
[time=1684] to be this bright light that transformed culture goes away. If that happens, the church becomes
[time=1690] inept and ineffective, losing any semblance of uniqueness and strength. So Paul says,
[time=1697] so Paul in essence, context, right? So Paul is saying, hey, listen, I know what Ephesus is like
[time=1704] and I know the leadership culture, if you will, in your culture, folks there in Ephesus is filled
[time=1710] with greed and immorality and promiscuity. But Paul in essence says as he writes this third chapter,
[time=1718] as it relates to the church, not us. We're not going to go that way. It's not going to look that way.
[time=1726] No, we will be led by God's design, by high caliber, high quality, high integrity men who serve faithfully as elders. And here's a whole chapter given to that very truth.
[time=1740] Now I've also had some conversations with some who kind of playfully and jokingly have said,
[time=1747] hey, wow, three weeks on leadership in the church, can't we move on to something maybe a little more practical and applicable. And some have said it in just and I think some have actually questioned
[time=1758] the idea of three weeks and just this one topic. But let me just on the let's get on to something more practical front. Let me just say this to you.
[time=1765] Whether you ever lead, whether you ever lead at all in some official capacity
[time=1775] here in this church, whether you ever serve as an elder, whether you ever serve as a deacon,
[time=1784] we're going to come to this passage this morning on deacons. Whether you ever serve in an official capacity or not, I want every one of you to understand this. These first Timothy
[time=1795] three character qualities throughout the entire chapter, all of these first Timothy three character
[time=1802] qualities represent godliness. They represent the foundations of godliness, character,
[time=1815] and integrity. And I want every one of you in this room to understand this morning,
[time=1822] I want husbands and dads to hear this, whether you're young or old. I want business owners,
[time=1829] I want those who work for business owners, I want young men, young women, older women, I want everybody in this room this morning to understand that godliness and character
[time=1841] and integrity matter. It really matters. It's really that important. These chapter three leadership
[time=1853] qualities are as practical and as applicable to your everyday life no matter who you are,
[time=1859] as you could ever hope for, integrity, character, godliness. I read it this week and I just wrote
[time=1866] it down for you. These are the traits that separate integrity, character, godliness. These are the
[time=1872] traits that separate his blessing from feudal living. These traits, when you and I are willing
[time=1881] to grab hold of them and give ourselves to the pursuit of these things being lived out in our lives,
[time=1887] men and women, these traits are what separate fruitfulness and joy from a life of despair and regret.
[time=1895] These traits are what separate what God wants for us and what you might miss.
[time=1906] You want to experience fulfillment? You want to experience the promises of God?
[time=1916] That was a question. Do you want to experience fulfillment? Do you want to experience in your
[time=1923] life the promises of God? Then grab hold, my friend, of character and integrity and godliness.
[time=1931] So, contact so important for us to remember and the usefulness and the relevance of these
[time=1938] things. Oh my goodness, it's off the charts. So, open your Bibles. I hope you already have it open to 1 Timothy 3 verses 8 to 13. Would you, in honor of God's word, stand and allow me the privilege
[time=1949] of reading this to you this morning. Paul's letter to Timothy in the Church at Ephesus
[time=1955] we've dealt with in the first half of this chapter, the qualifications for those men who would serve
[time=1963] as elder, those who oversee, ultimately oversee and care for the spiritual and physical health of the
[time=1970] body. Now, he comes to deacons in verse 8 and he says this, deacons likewise, the word likewise meaning just as it was so important that you understand the qualifications of an elder.
[time=1981] Now, he comes to deacons and he says likewise in the same vein must be men of dignity,
[time=1987] not double-tongued or addicted to much wine or fond of sordid gain but holding to the mystery of
[time=1995] the faith where they clear conscience. These men, these deacons must also first be tested,
[time=2002] then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach. Women must likewise be dignified,
[time=2010] not malicious gossip, but temperate, faithful in all things. Deacons must be husbands of only one
[time=2018] wife and good managers of their children and their own households for those who have served well
[time=2025] as deacons, obtained for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith
[time=2031] that is in Christ Jesus. Our Father in heaven, we stand this morning grateful for the privilege
[time=2040] of reading and taking in and being exposed to God being penetrated by the life-changing truth of your
[time=2048] Word. Oh God, we don't just read it this morning but we desire to be taught by it, we desire to be
[time=2055] encouraged by it. God, I pray that it would paint a picture for men and women old and young in this
[time=2063] place that would be for them God something that they can live for, something that they can strive
[time=2069] for. God would the character qualities of these men that are described, these women that are
[time=2075] described, may it be something that we can gain great strength from and great hope from and great inspiration. God thank you for this time. Teach us please for it's in your son's name that we pray.
[time=2087] Amen. You can be seated. Well right out of the gate there in the text you see in verse 8 it says
[time=2094] deacons and I want to just make sure you understand what this word means, where this word or office
[time=2100] comes from and to do that I want to just kind of give you the backdrop on this. Would you go back in your Bibles? Let me hear those pages turned. Go all the way back to Acts chapter 6. Go ahead,
[time=2111] turn back to Acts chapter 6 if you would and by the way if you're new with us this morning and you don't have a Bible, if you've been with us for a while and you don't have a Bible we'd love to put one in your hands. If it would just come up and talk to us afterwards we would be thrilled to get you a Bible. For those of you that have them look with me at Acts chapter 6 verses 1 to 4
[time=2129] let me just give you some historical backdrop into where this office of Deacon and the function of
[time=2135] Deacon came from. Here we are in Acts 6 things are really starting to happen as the kingdom of God
[time=2143] and the family of God is growing and moving forward. Now at this time it says in chapter 6 verse 1 now at this time while the disciples were increasing in number a complaint arose on the part of the
[time=2156] Hellenistic Jews against the native Hebrews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily
[time=2164] serving of food. Now stop right there just real quick what you've got going on here is the apostles
[time=2170] and as we think about the apostles those who were giving leadership to this newly birthed church I want you to think elder hadn't quite gone that far yet but it was on its way there but you have
[time=2181] those who were responsible for this thing they were the apostles. From the apostles were giving themselves faithfully to the teaching of the Scriptures and prayer for the family and as the
[time=2194] church grew and the responsibility of teaching and prayer grew for those who were giving oversight
[time=2201] there were everyday things that were starting to fall through the cracks in this case here in
[time=2207] Acts 6 there were widows who weren't getting fed and so being filled with wisdom these guys
[time=2213] understood they couldn't do all this by themselves and so as elders as apostles if you will so the
[time=2219] 12 look at verse 2 so the 12 summon the congregation of the disciples and said it is not desirable for
[time=2226] us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables therefore brethren select from among you
[time=2235] seven men of what of good reputation high character high caliber high integrity men
[time=2242] full of the spirit and of wisdom whom we may put in charge of this task but we will the elders the
[time=2251] apostles we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word you'll see it there on
[time=2259] the screen you can just write it down the purpose of deacons found right there in that acts passage and I hope you'll you'll remember this men and women of character men and women of character as we
[time=2271] saw from our passage there in 1 Timothy 3 who assist elders in the shepherding and care of the
[time=2278] church the function of a deacon is to assist they serve at the pleasure and the direction of the
[time=2286] elder to care for spiritually and physically whatever needs there are in whatever way the body of
[time=2293] Christ needs help in whatever way the elders need assistance in delivering that help deacons are there to do whatever they can to put their arms around the everyday needs of people the everyday
[time=2304] needs that those who are teaching and preaching and praying for in an oversight capacity as elders
[time=2313] needs that they can't always get to so it was with great wisdom that deacons were instituted here
[time=2319] and let me just read you what it says here at the bottom of my bible in my notes if you go back to first Timothy 3 let me just read this to you deacons the word the word deacon in the Greek comes from in the Greek language comes from a word group meaning to serve
[time=2336] originally referring to the waiting of tables act six deacon came to denote any service in the
[time=2343] church deacons gave themselves to any service in the church deacons serve under the leadership of
[time=2349] elders helping them exercise oversight in the practical matters of church life scripture defines
[time=2355] no official or specific responsibilities for deacons they are to do whatever the elders assign them
[time=2362] or whatever spiritual ministry is necessary it's a great privilege it's a great honor
[time=2370] and a great need in any church for there to be those who are willing to spiritually physically
[time=2376] put their arms around the family and help the elders by exercising care now he gives some
[time=2383] qualities for deacons and i just hope you're not tired of these lists because i'm telling you these lists are filled with things that you and i need to hear and understand better let's jump
[time=2394] in real quick qualities of a deacon for men and women and i want to stop and say this just up front
[time=2401] before we actually get to it i want you to understand you know i told you a couple weeks ago and i meant it that god has a great plan for and god has a great desire for women i know there were some
[time=2414] who were concerned as we made our way through the qualifications of an elder and as we talked about how the church services to go there were some who maybe felt as if in god's design women were relegated to some place of silence in the back row not being able to do anything it wasn't at all
[time=2430] what what we taught it's not at all what god's word says and it certainly doesn't represent god's heart toward women he designed you as women uniquely he designed he designed you to help and and bring
[time=2442] to the mix whether it's with a husband or the ministry of a church those things that you alone can uniquely bring and i love how once he gets past elders now he comes to deacons those who serve
[time=2454] under the elders in a significant way the physical spiritual needs of the church he goes right to men and women and i'm so thankful for those of you in this room men and women who serve in this
[time=2465] capacity so thankful for i think many others who i believe in the days to come will join us in serving
[time=2472] in this capacity here are the character qualities of a deacon and for the men and for the women
[time=2478] number one the men should be dignified it says it right there in the text it says deacons likewise
[time=2484] must be men of dignity men you must be dignified the word means those who when necessary can be
[time=2492] serious not flippant about the things that matter most doesn't mean that you're boring it doesn't
[time=2498] mean that you're stale it means that you have enough maturity to know when to have fun and when to bear down when to be able to work think minister speak with a level of maturity and
[time=2511] seriousness when when the situation calls for it dignified as a deacon this must be a quality
[time=2519] of those men who serve not double-tongued you see it there not double-tongued you can probably guess
[time=2525] what this means a godly leader never says one thing to one group and something entirely different
[time=2532] to another you just don't do that in the life of a godly leader there's never a sense of verbal
[time=2540] hypocrisy you say what you mean you say what's right you say what's true you communicate at a level
[time=2548] that is consistent and god-honoring not double-tongued not preoccupied with wine is really a great
[time=2556] rendering of this idea of not being addicted to wine you see it there in the text men of dignity
[time=2562] not double-tongued or addicted to much wine Steve dealt with this last week in his message again
[time=2570] it's worth just repeating that what this says is basically this man who is not addicted to much
[time=2577] wine doesn't have a reputation as a drinker he's not governed by or in any way controlled by drink
[time=2586] and I mentioned this first hour it's worth mentioning again for those of you who might want to get a
[time=2592] little loose with this please understand that the word wine here means drink please don't sit there and think that this is just about wine and you can have all your scotch you can have all your
[time=2604] whatever this is a word talking about drinking alcohol all right we get that cleared up all right
[time=2613] good not preoccupied with drink not addicted to much wine in fact not only is he not addicted
[time=2621] to drink no he's addicted he's controlled by the holy spirit
[time=2629] and he's addicted to obedience this is something that it's just good for us to think about it's good
[time=2635] for us to chew on this this is a man of character he's honest about and with money as the passage
[time=2642] continues you see right there not addicted to much wine or fond of sordid gain or fond of sordid
[time=2650] gain one thing that bears mentioning is that the deacons in the early church were the ones who at
[time=2656] the end of the day collected the what collected the offerings they were the guys that oftentimes handled the money and so it's important that this guy wouldn't be a guy who's looking to get rich quick this guy's not addicted to wine he's also not fond of sordid gain he's not controlled by some
[time=2673] desire to have more cash this guy is content this guy understands what god has provided him he
[time=2679] functions within that he's not fond of sordid gain like elders deacons aren't motivated by a love
[time=2691] for money but instead are driven by a love for god and his people and verse 10 it says these men
[time=2700] must also be tested then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach it really is a
[time=2708] great process that we can go through as we sit with men and get to know men and understand better
[time=2714] what motivates them and and what their life looks like and how it is over a period of time they
[time=2721] conduct themselves inside and outside the household of god see you sit with men and you test them
[time=2728] those men want to be a godly man a godly leader wants to be tested see this man opens his life
[time=2738] and heart to you and you're able to see into the very realities of his life and this testing is a
[time=2744] good test it's a test of integrity a test of character and the passage says having been tested
[time=2751] if you find them and there's that phrase we saw back in the first part of our elder study if the test finds them to be above reproach and again don't be blown away by that phrase that phrase
[time=2762] basically means you take all these character qualities and you kind of add them up and if
[time=2768] this guy scores well if this guy has seemed to be faithful not perfect but faithful in these areas
[time=2774] and growing let him serve it says let him serve above reproach now you come to verse 11 and all
[time=2785] of a sudden boom it just says it women we're talking about those who give assistance to the elders in
[time=2791] the spiritual physical oversight and serving of the family of god and right there it says women now
[time=2798] hear me on this there are some we're not of them and i'm not one who thinks this way but there are
[time=2804] some who are so committed to male supremacy and the man only thing and there are some who really
[time=2814] want the woman in the back row quiet and they miss in that the heart of god and the design that he
[time=2820] has for the church that they think when they come to this passage and i've heard it said for years
[time=2827] this is about the deacon's wife what you see here in verse 11 well i can just tell you honestly
[time=2833] from my heart as i've studied this as i've learned from others who have studied this this isn't about a deacon's wife it says women what likewise just like it said deacons likewise these are women
[time=2849] gifted and prepared by god with heart and character and integrity who are able to come alongside
[time=2858] the unique needs that god allows them and enables them to meet and serving the physical spiritual
[time=2864] needs of the body women are to be as you see it right there in verse 11 women must likewise be
[time=2872] dignified and we've already looked at that word able to be serious when needed able to deal with
[time=2878] the issues of god and his people in a way that's respectable and wise dignified not malicious gossips
[time=2887] we've talked about this before women a mark of character women a mark of integrity for you in your life is that you learn how to and exercise the control of your tongue malicious gossip i've told
[time=2901] you before as a phrase used several times throughout the new testament to describe the activity of satan this is what satan does satan deceives satan satan satan slanders satan talks about
[time=2916] satan brings division through what gets spoken and this isn't at all this isn't at all the picture
[time=2925] that god paints for you as a godly woman of character you're not to talk ill of others you're
[time=2931] not to bring division as you communicate about others things that are speculative are not even true no the godly woman controls her tongue and her speech she's dignified she's not malicious
[time=2943] with her speech she's temperate i love that word it got talked about when we talked about the elder
[time=2950] the godly woman full of character is temperate it's a great word means she's characterized by clear
[time=2957] mindedness she's not scattered she's not fuzzy she knows what she believes she understands how
[time=2964] that can be translated into ministry as it relates to spiritual matters there's a clearness and a
[time=2971] sharpness to her she's able to take that clearness and that spiritual sharpness and spiritually care
[time=2978] for people and give direction she's vigilant it's a great word and women i want you to see this last
[time=2986] word that's used here in verse 11 women must likewise be dignified not malicious gossip but temperate faithful ladies young women girls in the room understand that god's design
[time=3003] for you and a character quality that you should just pursue with everything in you is that you
[time=3011] should be a woman who is found faithful you know what it means bottom line ladies a woman of character
[time=3020] a godly woman whose heart and life and soul are marked by integrity is trustworthy
[time=3030] you ladies you can be trusted you are trusted by your family you are trusted by your husband
[time=3042] you are trusted by your church and you and i understand that what brings trust is faithfulness
[time=3051] who you are in public is who you are in private what you say you're going to do you do
[time=3060] what you profess as your belief you do your best with god's help to live out and listen ladies
[time=3067] where you are not faithful where you're untrustworthy you admit it and you confess it and you ask for
[time=3079] help and you get better at that god grows you but oh what a quality for the women of our family
[time=3088] oh what a quality for you ladies in your life today and in your life in the future that you would be found faithful amen and then he jumps back to the men as the passage begins to wind down
[time=3103] deacons must be husbands of only one wife we talked about that a few weeks ago a one woman
[time=3109] man we believe this is clearly about a man who today with the wife he is married to he is faithful
[time=3117] and devoted to her and her alone the husband of only one wife and a good manager
[time=3124] this deacon is a good manager just like the elder a good manager of their children and their own
[time=3130] households godliness character and integrity men it shows up it really does it shows up at home
[time=3143] i was talking to somebody a couple weeks ago about this whole idea of men being listen men being assessed this conversation i had with a friend was kind of along the lines
[time=3156] of how would we how would we do that i was like kelly help me out with this i mean how do you really
[time=3162] know if there's a guy who wants to be an elder or there's a guy who wants to be a deacon or there's just a guy who's wanting to have his godliness his character his integrity assessed on this
[time=3174] on this he manages his household well it's faithful to his wife and faithful to his kids
[time=3181] how do you know so it's a great conversation and i'll just share this with you what i said to him
[time=3188] i won't say it all but i'll say this to you know what few things number one
[time=3194] it really is possible for me for instance to sit down with you as a man i could sit down
[time=3200] with you for a couple of hours in my office we could meet at a restaurant sit in a booth and i think it would be appropriate for me to ask you questions that i could ask you i've been at
[time=3210] this for a while i got a lot to learn still but i could sit with you as a man and i could ask you questions about your relationship with your wife i could ask you some questions about the relationship you have with your kids we could talk about the way you manage your life we could talk about the way in which you invest in your children spiritually and emotionally we could talk about all of that and i think we could gain some insight from that there are men in this church who have been at it longer than i and i could have you sit with them and they would ask you a whole nother set of questions and it would all be done with a spirit of love and kindness and a desire to help you assess where you are on this he manages his household well front and there are a few more things that we could have you do but i've said this for years and i'll
[time=3255] say it again to you this morning another way to find out how you're doing as a man
[time=3262] loving and caring for your wife and kids is to ask your wife and kids
[time=3274] to ask them your household and i know they won't always get it perfectly right
[time=3282] but i know if and you know as well as i know that one place to go to get a really accurate picture
[time=3291] of how deeply and how faithfully and how meaningfully your loving or i'm loving our families is to ask
[time=3301] my wife and yours my kids and yours and in that there probably are some things for me and you to
[time=3310] keep learning and i'm just i'm so thankful that god puts this out in front of us and so grateful
[time=3316] that we get to continue as men and as women to understand what character integrity godliness
[time=3324] looks like so that we can together pursue it amen amen would you stand and let me pray for you i
[time=3330] tell you what this week would be a great week for you all of you as you think about these things this would be a great week for you to go to our website by about wednesday afternoon thursday morning and download the digging deeper material most of you know every week you can go to the website download the digging deeper material it's a continuation of that sunday's
