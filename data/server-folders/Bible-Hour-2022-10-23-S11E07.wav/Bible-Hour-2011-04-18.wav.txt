[time=33] [MUSIC - 163 seconds]
[time=201] (upbeat music) - Do you hear the joy of the sound?
[time=226] [MUSIC - 78 seconds]
[time=309] (audience applauding)
[time=315] - Well, hi, everybody.
[time=316] It's great to be with you again.
[time=318] Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=319] And I want to introduce to you right out of the gate here.
[time=322] A friend of mine and someone who's part of our family here, Black Hawk, Melinda Connolly.
[time=327] Hi, Melinda.
[time=328] - Hi.
[time=329] - Good to have you here with us.
[time=330] And Melinda and her family are a part of the Black Hawk family.
[time=334] And I wanted her to come today because I'm so grateful for what God has been doing in her heart and life.
[time=341] I'm so thankful for what he does in so many hearts in the lives around this place.
[time=346] But what I know he's been up to with Melinda is something that I'm hoping and praying he'll continue to be doing in the lives of many.
[time=355] And Melinda, I don't want to tell your story, but my sense is, and I want you to share it with the viewing audience, my sense is that God's really been growing you as it relates to this whole idea of serving.
[time=369] And as we've talked about that, I've just found it encouraging and fascinating to see how he's kind of just led you down this road and really raised the bar, kind of waved the flag on how important it is that we as followers of Christ are engaged in serving the needs of others.
[time=387] Talk about how he kind of has raised that bar in your own life and experience.
[time=393] - Well, I think for me, it, excuse me, was actually a progression of things.
[time=397] Part of it was he wore a teaching from a pulpit.
[time=400] Talking about how we need to basically get involved, get connected and go, that was part of it.
[time=406] Part of it was through my home community.
[time=408] John Barsas, our leader, and we've been doing a study of crazy love. - Gotcha.
[time=412] - And if you've read that book that you know that it's so much about serving.
[time=416] - Yeah, crazy love by Francis Chan.
[time=418] - Francis Chan. - Yes.
[time=419] - That's great, great material.
[time=421] - Yes, and then I was so enthralled with that book.
[time=424] For Christmas, my husband got me the follow-up.
[time=426] The sequel to that is The Forgotten God, which talks about the neglect of the Holy Spirit.
[time=431] So really, for the first time in my life, I'm actually a fairly new Christian.
[time=436] I was baptized about three years ago.
[time=439] Realized I was neglecting the Holy Spirit.
[time=441] I wasn't asking for prompting.
[time=443] I wasn't looking for leading.
[time=444] I was still kind of doing my own thing as sort of a Christian, a lukewarm Christian, if you will.
[time=450] And so I really start praying and I say God, I want you to please show me where you want me to be.
[time=454] Tell me what you want me to do.
[time=456] And first, I actually didn't get a response that I thought I could understand.
[time=462] And I realized that he was saying, no, my daughter, you have to step up and step out, and I will meet you.
[time=468] - That's great.
[time=469] - And so I started to think and I started to pray, where can I serve?
[time=473] What can I do besides serving the people that I know?
[time=477] How can I serve people I don't know, the least of these?
[time=480] And so I started looking for those opportunities and actually went to the Blackhawk website, kind of just scanning, searching.
[time=486] And I saw that Blackhawk supported seven local ministries, and I thought, well, what are these ministries?
[time=491] No, I probably should know, but I don't.
[time=494] So got in contact with Jeff Harlist, we actually had a discussion and started talking about those local ministries and what we could do for them or what more we could do to support them besides just writing a check every month.
[time=506] And so I think led by the Holy Spirit decided I would actually go to these ministries and compile a needs list.
[time=514] I thought I'm not the only one who probably is wanting this information.
[time=517] So compile a needs list, went to these ministries who welcomed me with open arms, so come on down.
[time=523] - I didn't send you to do this.
[time=525] - No, no.
[time=525] - Yeah, John didn't send you to do this.
[time=527] This is just you realizing to follow Jesus, we need to serve those in need and the Holy Spirit's prompting you.
[time=536] And so you're going down this road.
[time=537] - So I'm going down this road.
[time=539] I'm thinking, what are the needs?
[time=540] I mean, let's not reinvent the wheel.
[time=542] These are the ministries that Black Ops currently support.
[time=545] So I didn't pick these ministries.
[time=546] - Yeah.
[time=547] - Okay, we're actually financially supporting them anywhere from five years to almost 30 years.
[time=552] - Wow.
[time=552] These are places like the Love Church.
[time=555] - Yes, in as much.
[time=557] - In as much.
[time=558] - Rescue Ministries, which is the umbrella of the men's portion is the mission, the rescue mission and the women's portion is the Caris House.
[time=566] The Allen County Jail Chaplaincy.
[time=568] - Oh, that's good.
[time=569] Neighbor Link.
[time=571] - And Hope Center.
[time=573] Wow, great, great ministries.
[time=574] So you compile a list.
[time=577] You visit all these ministries and you compile a list.
[time=579] And this is where it gets fun for me.
[time=581] And for our family here at Black Ops, what we've decided to do, and again, I feel like the Lord has really been in this, is we're going to take these local ministries and Melinda's involvement in this process and she now is serving in a really cool capacity as a volunteer with our small group and Sunday morning ABF ministries.
[time=601] You're going to be a liaison between the communities of Black Hawk and all these opportunities.
[time=608] - Yes, I mean, I believe our hope would be, I know what I hope and what I pray for is that we small groups will actually come behind these ministries and we will, for lack of better, we're possibly adopt these ministries and actually step in and get involved because I do believe once you actually go down there and you see the need and you see the people and you have a love for the people that you will just feel that tug at your heart by the Holy Spirit to donate two hours every week or three hours a month.
[time=636] It doesn't have to be a huge time commitment.
[time=639] And one of the things that I look for were opportunities for entire families to serve and opportunities for individuals to serve and opportunities for small groups to serve.
[time=648] So there's kind of something for everyone.
[time=650] - That's good.
[time=651] And I just wanted you all to hear this.
[time=653] A, I wanted you to be thankful for just the fact that God is at work in this place.
[time=658] And I know we're home for you in many ways.
[time=661] And so I know that I'll encourage your heart.
[time=663] Secondly, I want you to know that this is going on because I know many of you continue to consider coming and being a part of this family.
[time=670] And I want to continue to help you understand what this family is about.
[time=674] We're trying our best with God's help to grow disciples who follow after Jesus and Melinda and others are encouraging me and reminding me that that entails serving, the least of these, serving those in need.
[time=687] And now with Melinda's help through God's work in her life, all of our small groups, all of our ministries, all of our AVFs are gonna have a chance to engage in that practice on a much more regular basis.
[time=700] So God's doing good things.
[time=702] - And can I add one more thing?
[time=702] - Yes, you can.
[time=703] - Because this was a real impetus for me to do this.
[time=705] We homeschool our children for many reasons.
[time=708] But one of the things that was so important to me is that our children learn how to serve rather than become an adult like myself who's wasted 25 years, basically, not being a Christian, not knowing to serve.
[time=719] So I was really looking for those opportunities and I feel like too many times we don't do enough to encourage our children to serve.
[time=727] We do the hit and miss a couple times a year, but really regular conditioning that this is just what you do.
[time=736] And that was really the heart for me to really push this forward.
[time=739] - Normative, everyday life, yeah.
[time=741] Well, hey, be encouraged.
[time=743] Thank you, Melinda, for being with me this morning.
[time=746] Good to be with all of you again.
[time=747] God bless you.
[time=748] Thank you so much for tuning in.
[time=750] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=752] (upbeat music) - So many people spread their clothes on the road
[time=763] and others spread leafy branches that come from the fields and those who end up for the Lord and those who follow were shouting to Him, "Hosanna, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=775] Blessed is the coming kingdom of our Father, Daniel, Hosanna, and the highest." (upbeat music)
[time=798] [MUSIC - 253 seconds]
[time=1056] (audience applauding) - Well, open your Bibles if you would this morning, not to first Timothy, but open your Bibles, my friends, to John chapter 12, if you would.
[time=1066] Go to the Gospel of John, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and go to John 12.
[time=1071] We're gonna take a couple of weeks off of our study, True Church, God's design for the body of Christ.
[time=1078] It's been a great study and great discussion in the letter that Paul writes to Timothy, as he pastors the church there at Ephesus, but we're gonna break from that for a couple of weeks as we hopefully kind of give thought here today and obviously next Sunday, to the great significance, my friends, of what we approach here in our faith, approach to the resurrection and all that transpired and all that we can see and learn from really this week that we enter into right here on Palm Sunday.
[time=1112] Let me get you thinking about this week.
[time=1116] Let me get you thinking about what our Lord maybe experienced this week.
[time=1123] I wanna show you some things that he went through and this week leading up to the crucifixion, but I wanna start by just asking you this, what if, what if, let's say, what if I had gone to the doctor this week?
[time=1140] And what if, and I know this is kind of a big what if, it usually doesn't happen this quick, but what if he told me I had a week to live?
[time=1149] What if somehow, some way, God spoke to me in a dream or I went to my doctor or somehow I knew that I would never be here with you ever again
[time=1165] in this setting?
[time=1168] What if I knew this was it?
[time=1173] What would I be thinking?
[time=1175] How would I be feeling?
[time=1177] What would be going through my mind?
[time=1180] What if somehow you knew?
[time=1183] What if somehow somebody communicated to you today that you had six, seven days and that was it, had a week to live?
[time=1193] And you were going to die.
[time=1197] Everyone you know, everything you know, your entire life as you know it today, over and done from an earthly perspective, you got one week to live.
[time=1209] I can only imagine the things that you and I would begin to consider.
[time=1214] I can only imagine the things you and I would begin to think about and contemplate.
[time=1218] I can only begin to imagine the plans that you and I would immediately begin to make stuff that would just kind of kick in and the things that would rise to the, what, top and the stuff that would just begin to go away?
[time=1238] I want you to think about this because this is exactly what Jesus encounters as we come to John chapter 12, we get a chance to look in here in John and throughout the Gospels.
[time=1250] One can, you can, I can at any time look in on the last week of his life.
[time=1257] What if we put a clock on the wall?
[time=1261] And what if it started?
[time=1266] And what if that clock was for you?
[time=1269] What if, as I'm talking about this right now, your week, your last one began to take away?
[time=1278] Well, the clock has started to take for our Lord as we come to John 12.
[time=1284] And as we look at some events from his life, I want you to be encouraged.
[time=1289] I want you to be open in your heart to being really challenged and convicted.
[time=1294] I want you to see clearly the way he comes at this.
[time=1298] Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, Savior of the world and Son of God sent by the
[time=1305] Father to live, die and defeat death, to redeem and restore broken people and their broken world, had faithfully made his way to what he knew
[time=1316] would be the last days of his life and an ending.
[time=1321] And an ending to his life that would be for him personally, horrific.
[time=1328] An ending that would be for you and me eternally healing.
[time=1333] And with the clock winding down toward his death, second by second, minute by minute.
[time=1341] It has always amazed me how he goes about ending, finishing his days on earth, how he lives fully and purposefully, almost laser focused.
[time=1357] Well, with each passing hour he inches ever closer to the end.
[time=1363] When you stop and take notice, and I want us to do that this morning, when you stop and take notice of how he spends his last week, when you watch him preparing to die, you can't help but take note of the character with which he does this.
[time=1377] You can't help but take note of the values that come to the surface.
[time=1381] You cannot help but take note and see the priorities that he models for us as he walks toward the cross.
[time=1391] And I'm sure there are things that I've missed.
[time=1394] There's no way in one message we can really cover every single thing that transpired in his week.
[time=1400] But here's a snapshot, my friends, of his last days.
[time=1404] Some things he gave himself to and some possible truth and application for you and I to take home and consider as we think about how he faced the end as we consider how you and I might
[time=1418] with our clock winding down, how we might face the end.
[time=1424] Here we go.
[time=1426] John, chapter 12, look how the text opens up there in the first verse.
[time=1432] It says, "Jesus, therefore, six days before the Passover came to Bethany."
[time=1439] I want you to stop right there.
[time=1441] Jesus, six days before the Passover, just so you can have a frame of reference, that makes this Saturday.
[time=1448] Passover would have been on Thursday is when that started.
[time=1451] So here we have Saturday.
[time=1453] Here the whole thing begins to kind of unfold.
[time=1457] And it's so interesting to me.
[time=1460] John 12, 1 and 2, Jesus, therefore, six days before the Passover came to Bethany
[time=1466] where who was?
[time=1468] Say it.
[time=1469] It's the first thing that pops in your head.
[time=1472] Say it.
[time=1474] Raise them from the dead.
[time=1476] Huh.
[time=1478] Came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had what?
[time=1484] Say it, Church, everybody out loud together, raised from the dead.
[time=1488] You came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
[time=1496] So they made him a supper there.
[time=1499] And Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with him.
[time=1506] And I want to just give you a little brief insight into the grammar there.
[time=1510] The Greek phrase where it talks about how Lazarus was one reclining at the table.
[time=1516] There may have been even many more in that room, but the way the text notes that Lazarus
[time=1523] is reclining with him, it paints a picture of intimacy.
[time=1529] Those who would recline with you were those who were close to you.
[time=1534] Those who reclined with you were those who you really, really wanted to be with.
[time=1542] And he's a week away from death and resurrection.
[time=1547] And he wants to be with one who has been resurrected.
[time=1552] And you're thinking, okay, where are you going with this?
[time=1557] Nowhere.
[time=1558] That's it.
[time=1559] That's all I got to say on that.
[time=1562] There's nothing else said.
[time=1564] There's no other cross-reference where we get insight into what went on there.
[time=1568] I'm just saying it struck me as interesting.
[time=1572] I've read this for years.
[time=1573] It just jumps out at me this week.
[time=1575] He's on his way to die.
[time=1577] He's going into a tomb.
[time=1580] God's going to raise him from the dead, and he decides to have lunch with the only other guy we know of on earth at this point who had seen the inside of a tomb on his way out.
[time=1593] And Jesus had called him out, and now they're sitting there having coffee or whatever.
[time=1602] A bagel.
[time=1607] I don't know if it was the human part of Jesus saying, "Dude, what was it like?"
[time=1613] I have no idea.
[time=1614] I just thought it was interesting.
[time=1616] And I'll just leave it at that Saturday before this thing really starts to unfold.
[time=1621] He hangs out with a guy who had been resurrected from the dead.
[time=1627] Sunday.
[time=1629] You can write this down.
[time=1630] He finally, Jesus finally receives praise.
[time=1634] Corbin and I were talking about this this week.
[time=1637] It's such a fascinating picture.
[time=1639] I say finally, because as Corbin and I talked about it, we just were reminded of the fact that all through Jesus is public ministry.
[time=1647] As you read through the gospels, anybody who's ever looked at the way Jesus handles himself
[time=1653] or postures himself in his ministry, you and I, as we look at the gospels, we see again and again and again.
[time=1659] He's deflecting praise.
[time=1662] Jesus has always been shunning and stepping away from and slipping out the back, if you
[time=1668] will.
[time=1669] He's never been one to openly receive it.
[time=1671] He's always tried to kind of push it off.
[time=1674] He's always been deflecting praise, and now we come to Sunday and look what the text says there in 12, it says on the next day, started on Saturday in Bethany with Lazarus.
[time=1686] We come to Sunday, verse 12, the large crowd.
[time=1689] On the next day, the large crowd who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him and began to shout.
[time=1701] Now we have a multitude in the streets, and they're shouting Hosanna.
[time=1706] They're shouting, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.
[time=1713] They're shouting this, great multitudes of people.
[time=1718] The term Hosanna, maybe you know this, maybe you don't.
[time=1720] The term Hosanna is a Hebrew phrase that means give salvation now.
[time=1728] Give salvation.
[time=1729] Are you kidding me?
[time=1730] These people knew who he was.
[time=1733] His reputation, by this point, had now preceded him.
[time=1736] They knew who he was.
[time=1738] They were proclaiming his messiahship.
[time=1741] They're saying in their chant, give salvation now.
[time=1747] Hosanna, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, and there he is.
[time=1754] Jesus finding a young donkey.
[time=1758] Set on it, as it is written, "Fear not, daughter of Zion, behold your king is coming, seated
[time=1765] on a donkey's colt." I love how he's finally willing to receive praise.
[time=1773] I love how he's finally willing to accept all that the people want to bring to him in
[time=1780] the form of their praise and adulation, but I'm so thankful for the poem that meant a read, and I'm so thankful for the fact that even though he's willing to accept it, it's just so Jesus, right?
[time=1792] He comes in on a mule, and in the process just kind of paints this picture that just
[time=1798] keeps us real steady and real clear on what this is about.
[time=1805] He accepts praise.
[time=1806] Why?
[time=1808] I think it's clear as the weak unfolds, and oh my goodness, especially as Friday unfolds.
[time=1817] I believe that the willingness to now accept praise is because now in a very clear and
[time=1824] unambiguous way, the praise that he receives can now be directly connected to the glory
[time=1830] of God.
[time=1831] Now all that's about to happen, now all that he's going to go through, now all that's going to take place.
[time=1837] Now Jesus knows that the glory of God, now Jesus knows that the will of God, now Jesus
[time=1843] knows that God and God alone and his redemptive, glorious kingdom plan is going to finally
[time=1850] be on display, and so with the likelihood that God is now going to receive glory and
[time=1856] praise, Jesus is willing to be in that mix.
[time=1859] It's so timely, it's so humble, it's so right.
[time=1864] He finally receives praise.
[time=1870] As the passage goes on, we kind of make our way, it's a little hard to detect through just a reading, but we do make our way to Monday.
[time=1877] And I want to show you on Monday how here at the beginning of the week, Jesus shows us
[time=1883] in a very powerful and personal way how he lives in the mix of transparent human, his
[time=1891] transparent terror, how he lives in the mix of transparent terror and divine transcendence.
[time=1902] Before I show you that though, can I just read to you, join me if you would in chapter 12 verse 17, I want to just set the stage for you, I want to show you some things that are transpiring.
[time=1912] So the people, verse 17, who were with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, continued to testify about him.
[time=1923] The word about Lazarus, my friends, this idea that Jesus had raised someone from the dead,
[time=1929] I don't think you need me to stand here and tell you that's a big deal.
[time=1932] This was huge, people were talking about this, the word was getting out and the word was
[time=1939] beginning to multiply and the stories were beginning to spread.
[time=1943] For this reason also the people went and met him because they heard that he had performed
[time=1949] this sign, not many signs, they, now we're going to him in droves because they had heard
[time=1955] that he had performed this sign, he had raised someone from the dead.
[time=1961] This catches people's attention and not just those who were going to see him, but this also catches the attention of the Pharisees, John chapter 12, look at verse 19, so the
[time=1972] Pharisees as they watched all of this unfold said to each other, you see, you see that you
[time=1981] are not doing any good, I mean just picture a bunch of Pharisees looking at each other,
[time=1988] you know by now that they've concocted a plan to try and diminish Christ's personality
[time=1995] and his work and his message and they're trying all these things and now they're at their wits end, they're looking at each other saying look, they're going to him in droves, what
[time=2006] you're doing, what you're doing, what we're trying isn't working and I love how that verse ends, it says you see that you're not doing any good, look the world has gone after him,
[time=2018] they're throwing their hands up, the whole world's going after him, what are we doing?
[time=2024] And these are the moments where plans to diminish his ministry certainly begin to turn toward
[time=2032] plans to kill him, to be rid of him.
[time=2039] Now there were some Greeks, verse 20 among those who were going up to worship at the feast,
[time=2046] this is so important and interesting to me, I just want you to understand this, now there
[time=2052] were in this whole mix now, Jerusalem is a buzz and the Passover is about to begin,
[time=2058] Jesus has come into town, now there were some Greeks among those who were going up to worship
[time=2065] at the feast, let me just read this to you from my notes at the bottom of my page here,
[time=2073] 21 says these Greeks then came to Philip who was from Bethsaida of Galilee and began to
[time=2081] ask him saying sir we wish to see Jesus, most likely these Greeks and let me just bring
[time=2089] some context to that word Greek means Gentile, Greek means Gentile, most likely these were
[time=2100] Gentile converts to Judaism who had come up for the Passover and who in their desire to
[time=2107] see Jesus stood in direct antithesis to the attitude of the national Jewish leaders who
[time=2116] desired now to kill him at the very moment when the Jewish authorities plotted violently
[time=2122] to end his life Gentiles were beginning to desire his attention, it's just amazing how
[time=2129] all this begins to come together, all this begins to play out and Jesus answered them
[time=2136] saying the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified, truly truly I say to you verse 24 unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains alone but if
[time=2148] it dies it bears much fruit, he who loves his life, listen my friends this is for you
[time=2155] and I to understand and this is for you and I to emulate, he who loves his life loses it
[time=2163] and he who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life, if anyone serves
[time=2171] me he must follow me and where I am there my servant will be also, if anyone serves me
[time=2180] the father will honor him and now here comes this incredible statement of human transparency
[time=2187] and divine transcendence now my soul Jesus says now my soul has become what say at church
[time=2196] troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this purpose but
[time=2207] for this purpose I came to this hour, that my friends sounds eerily familiar doesn't
[time=2216] it if I were to have just read that to you if I had just had you sit down in here this
[time=2222] morning and said hey listen my soul has become troubled it's Jesus speaking what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this purpose I came to this hour if I said to all of you where was that 95% of you would have said the garden of Gethsemane because
[time=2239] most of us don't realize that the absolute that word troubled my soul is troubled it
[time=2245] means horror he was horrified and most of us just think of him being horrified on Friday
[time=2253] night guess what he was horrified Monday he was in terror Monday he knew all that was
[time=2269] coming and the very same words that fall from his lips as he kneels there in that garden
[time=2275] with blood dropping off his chin those very same words come out Monday and he says my soul is horrified the word means to be deeply anxious and it breaks my heart to read it
[time=2295] kills me to just stand here and think about it but at the same time you know what it gives me great encouragement that as it says in Hebrews I have a sympathetic savior who knows what
[time=2311] it's like doesn't he who knows what it's like to hurt who knows what it's like to be afraid
[time=2321] knows what it's like to be scared to death is horrified as he anticipates the terror
[time=2328] that will come at the end of the week he lives in the mix of transparent terror and divine
[time=2334] transcendence Tuesday I love what I found about Tuesday I kept reading through John but
[time=2341] by just got kind of a prompting to go back to Luke and as I go back to Luke I'm looking
[time=2348] in my study Bible here and the outline of Luke in my Bible gives me the entire week
[time=2356] of Jesus's activities and so I come to Tuesday and it strikes me that Tuesday you can write
[time=2362] it down he spends all day Tuesday exercising his gift he spends all day to listen he spends
[time=2369] all day Tuesday Monday he's horrified Monday his soul is deeply troubled and Tuesday he
[time=2378] goes back to work Tuesday he uses his gift Tuesday he exercises the gifting that God
[time=2385] had given him and the call that God had placed on him to proclaim the truth to those that
[time=2392] God had sent him to listen to this just listen he contends on Tuesday he contends with the Jewish rulers in chapter 20 verses 1 to 8 he teaches on the Passover to the crowds and
[time=2405] chapter 20 all the way through 21 38 the parable now it kind of breaks that down the parable
[time=2411] the wicked vine grower is taught in 29 to 19 an answer to the Pharisees is given through
[time=2417] his teaching about paying taxes in 20 20 to 26 he teaches an answer to the Sadducees about
[time=2424] the resurrection in 27 through 40 in chapter 20 a question for the scribes is taught about
[time=2430] on the messianic prophecy in 41 to 47 in 21 1 to 4 he teaches the lesson of the widows
[time=2437] might the widows offering the widows coin he teaches on this in 5 to 24 of chapter 21 a
[time=2444] prophecy a teaching about the destruction the future destruction of Jerusalem and then
[time=2450] in 21 verses 25 to 38 he teaches on the signs of the times he teaches and teaches and teaches
[time=2458] and teaches all the way through Tuesday. Now here's the deal on this one. When I got myself
[time=2471] thinking about having a week left and maybe as I got you thinking about having a week
[time=2479] left that clock just taken away I smiled a little bit because I thought about this movie
[time=2487] I had seen a while ago it's called the bucket list maybe you saw it maybe you didn't either way it's about two guys who are going to die Morgan Freeman Jack Nicholson and they decide
[time=2500] that they're going to go and pursue their bucket list and maybe you've thought about a bucket list again that's just a list you make of things you want to do places you want to go stuff you want to experience before you die and it was it was funny and it was entertaining
[time=2517] and these guys they just take off one of them's got money and one of them doesn't so the guy with money is going to help this other guy get to experience all his dreams and desires before he dies and they're jet setting all over the world doing all these things just checking stuff off and again sort of entertaining kind of funny but then towards the middle and
[time=2537] the end of the movie something happens that just kind of set me back and maybe if you saw it it got you thinking to this one guy's wife this one guy's wife tracks him down somewhere
[time=2549] across the world and says hey you think you think you might want to come home because like
[time=2556] we're all here and you're going to die and we'd like to be with you and he's like no
[time=2562] I got to do my bucket list I mean in essence is what he says I got to keep going and doing
[time=2569] things and going and seeing things that I want to do because I got a list and before
[time=2578] I die I got to make sure I get to do you with me you hear that so anyway on that picking
[time=2585] on a movie I just want you understand dying was eminent for our Lord and it wasn't about
[time=2593] him he kept teaching he kept doing ministry he didn't say hey Peter John guys I'm out of
[time=2605] here I hear there's a great little resort over in Laodicea and I'm going to go hang for
[time=2612] a few days I mean this is it and I want to get none of that ministry call purpose who
[time=2622] is he what had God called him to do and we had four days he keeps at it I've developed
[time=2632] and keep developing this huge appreciation the older I get for for those who are older
[time=2642] than me who just refused to pack it in I just have this growing appreciation for so
[time=2650] many dear senior adult friends who have been so kind to me and who model for me such graciousness
[time=2657] and godliness and I just love it when I see them not checking out amen they just keep
[time=2664] going I bumped into one this morning I wonder if he's out of areas hey Oscar you back there
[time=2671] Oscar yep rain is Raina next to you hi Raina you see there Oscar and Raina just just stand
[time=2680] up can you guys just stand up real quick to stand up Raina hang on here now watch this hi you guys I bump into Oscar this morning on his way to his door Oscar is a greeter maybe you've been met by Oscar Raina is a dear dear saint who gives me an encouraging word every time she sees me and she probably gives you the same Oscar's 94 Raina's 90 and
[time=2702] in June they will have been married 71 years and Oscar I always see Oscar and I say hey
[time=2713] Oscar it's good to see you and he always says what do you always say to me he always says
[time=2723] it's good to see anybody at my age you guys can sit down thank you very much I just I just
[time=2729] love the fact I love the fact that I'm you know I'm here sorta early on say he's just
[time=2738] he's here and he's gonna man that door and he's gonna collect offerings over on this far eye on he's just not gonna stop till he's done because it's what God's called him to
[time=2749] do and it's what he loves doing and I'm so thankful for the example of our Lord who in
[time=2756] the midst of horrific things to come that he knew we're heading his way he continues
[time=2763] to teach he continues to answer his call Thursday oh my what an amazing picture we get on Thursday
[time=2771] on Thursday the beginning of Passover he gathers the disciples in the upper room and among many things he washes their what say it louder church he washes their feet now again I said
[time=2782] this first hour I'll just remind you these feet as most of you know we're feet that had been walking not in grass and not on tile and not on marble these are feet that had been
[time=2793] walking on and living in dirt in dust that didn't shower in those days so to speak there
[time=2802] wasn't a lot of bars of soap at that time I mean these were feet these were real dirty
[time=2811] sweaty grimy feet and listen nobody washed feet in this day except the most menial subserp
[time=2823] servant lowest of individual I mean basically just so you can see in your mind's eye in
[time=2832] this culture the only ones who ever washed feet were like homeless poverty stricken just
[time=2839] absolute bottom of the rung people and so he stands up that night and he just flattens
[time=2851] the kingdom perspective of leadership he gets off his chair he just demolishes the platform
[time=2858] he gets you know he takes away the high place I mean he just flattens this picture of kingdom
[time=2865] leadership and look what it says there in 13 3 says Jesus knowing that the Father had
[time=2871] given all things into his hands and that he had come forth from God and was going back
[time=2877] to God isn't that great he knew Friday was coming but he also knew the ascension was coming he knew he was going home he got up from supper and laid aside his garments and taking a towel he girded himself then he poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded these guys
[time=2902] were shocked believe me nobody sat back and went oh cool a foot rub Peter says get away
[time=2910] for what are you doing you know Peter said stop and you remember Jesus said if I stop you don't get in and Peter said wash wash wash all of me these guys are shocked at this
[time=2922] picture and I say this to you simply to remind you today that in the midst of horrific things
[time=2928] coming with the end now growing ever closer he's thinking of them he's wanting to teach
[time=2935] them he's wanting to further invest in them he's wanting to leave them with a picture of that which is right and good fathers dads husbands in the room leaders coaches managers bosses
[time=2948] anybody in this room any of you watching on the broadcast if God has given you the privilege of being in a place of influence and leadership he leaves for you and me right here this picture
[time=2959] of quality leadership and quality leadership is leadership that gets on knees and washes
[time=2967] feet and strikes the loneliest position in the kingdom of God the greatest of these are
[time=2973] the least of these and it's a great great picture for you and I to be reminded of Friday Friday
[time=2986] we'll get to Friday my friends on Friday night and again I hope you'll be with us but suffice
[time=2992] to say that Friday the lesson we learned from our Lord is that he endures the terror of
[time=2998] torture and abuse with a quiet restraint first Peter to just write that down look it up today
[time=3005] first Peter to said he didn't utter what not a word first Peter to says that in the midst
[time=3015] of the spitting that in the midst of the slugging that in the midst of the slapping that in the
[time=3021] midst of the whipping that in the midst of the insults and the taunts in the midst of all
[time=3027] the abuse and torture he endures the terror of torture and abuse with a quiet restraint
[time=3036] anchored in the bigger picture of trust in God's purposes and I say that to you this morning
[time=3046] we'll get into it more on Friday but I want to just say to you I know that there are many in the room your terror and your difficulty that you find yourself in today isn't anywhere
[time=3056] near you know it and I know it but nonetheless if you were to tell me what you were facing my heart would break for you I know that there are those in the room who face things today that are beyond what you ever thought you'd have to encounter or even endure and yet I
[time=3072] know there are those of you in the room and your spirit isn't quiet you're struggling
[time=3080] to keep yourself anchored in a bigger picture of trust in him and you're yelling you're
[time=3088] flailing you're afraid you're scared you're panicked you're saying stuff and you're doing
[time=3095] things and you're going places that that that God doesn't want you to and I want to just stand here and try to lovingly just remind you of one who faced things far worse than you and I could ever imagine and because of the father whom he had faith and trust in
[time=3112] was able to endure all that he encounters with a quiet restraint then comes Friday night
[time=3127] and Saturday and then comes Sunday amen we'll get there I'm okay with I'm okay with country
[time=3140] music anybody in the room just okay with it I don't hate it but I hang on let's just be
[time=3148] honest here who loves country music raise your hand wow all right all right who hates
[time=3154] it all right then look we're living in harmony isn't that beautiful we got haters and lovers
[time=3161] and we're all here together amen I'm okay with it all right but I but I love Tim McGraw's
[time=3168] song live like you were what dying live like you were dying guy finds out he's going to
[time=3174] die and I talks about sky diving and Rocky Mountain climbing and 2.7 seconds on a bull
[time=3183] named Fu Manchu okay so I've listened to it a couple times and if I ever have a bull I'm
[time=3190] naming him fu that's a cool name I'm just telling you if I get another dog I'm going to name him Fu Manchu if we're getting another cat I'm going to kill it but never mind just
[time=3202] kidding just kidding harmony remember harmony we're all together here he talked about sky
[time=3211] diving and bull riding and you know mountain climbing but then I love the chorus I love
[time=3218] the lines but I tell you he says I know I loved deeper wouldn't you do that how's that
[time=3228] clock doing has your week wouldn't you do that wouldn't you love deeper I love how he
[time=3237] says that I love deeper I spoke what sweeter and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying this
[time=3247] a powerful lyric something about dying can bring about a readiness a commitment to live
[time=3253] out principles and pursue those things that matter most in life it's amazing how that
[time=3260] happens Jesus face the end my friends with great purpose with great clarity with great
[time=3267] character the clock was clock was winding down the terror of Friday inch closer and
[time=3278] closer and it's winding down for you if you understand this right the clock is winding
[time=3287] down for you and I want to just remind you of something I appreciate the illustration
[time=3294] of the clock I think it works I appreciate me getting you and I both to think about how we would live and what we would choose and the love that would deepen and the words that
[time=3305] would be sweeter and the forgiveness that would be offer I'm with you on all of that I'm so grateful for the example of our Lord as I look back on this week how he thought of others how he served and used his gifts no matter what was coming how he met with
[time=3322] those who he loved and had relationship with how he was committed to the very end of the truth I love what we've seen today and I love what you and I get to think about when we think about a week to live but here's the deal you're supposed to live you and I we're supposed to live like we're dying and in essence we should live without the clock once you kill
[time=3346] that clock boom no clock now how are you gonna live forget the clock you're gonna live how
[time=3358] long you're gonna live you know what it might not be a week it could be a day it could be
[time=3365] ninety four years maybe you'll be Oscar and Rayna maybe you look maybe you'll be married
[time=3372] eighty years I have no idea but whether you're married eighty years or whether you pass this
[time=3378] week what we see today is it matters how you live live fully live my friends live in
[time=3392] ways that honor him follow the example of our Lord amen let's stand and let's be dismissed
[time=3399] father and heaven we're grateful a clock on the wall helps us think about what it might be like but oh God minus the clock we still have an opportunity and a responsibility to
[time=3410] live with our immortality and view and God to live as people with an eternal perspective
[time=3417] God I pray that you would give us the courage it takes courage God it takes courage and strength
[time=3424] for the people in this room to live like they were dying to live with the end in view God
[time=3431] to live while making the kinds of choices and the kinds of decisions that we would make
[time=3437] if we knew it was almost over God I pray you'd give us that courage and that strength help
[time=3444] us to make hard decisions help us to be bold and courageous in our love and our service
[time=3451] allow us God the privilege of staying focused day after day on the things that matter most
[time=3457] and oh God I pray that you would bring us back together Friday night pray God that we
[time=3463] would enjoy the great and awesome celebration of Sunday we commit these days to you God
[time=3469] we commit to all the things that you would want to show us and teach us through these
[time=3475] days God do your mighty work in us and we will celebrate it and we will do our best to
[time=3481] faithfully live it out and all the people agreed and said
