[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] [MUSIC - 218 seconds]
[time=252] unto the land who sits on the throne, honor and power, dominion and praise, unto the land who sits on the throne, honor and power, dominion and praise.
[time=282] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=300] Oh, praise unto the land who sits on the throne, honor and power, dominion and praise, unto the land who sits on the throne, honor and power, dominion and praise, unto the land who sits on the throne,
[time=320] hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=362] Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour. It's great to be with you again and we're so thankful for these moments together each and every week.
[time=371] As you watch this, it's basically a week after Resurrection Sunday and what you'll see today on the Bible Hour is the unbelievable celebration that those who gathered here at Black Hawk this past Sunday got to experience as we celebrated the greatest day,
[time=388] the greatest event of all, the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I want to just say to you as you watch this that even though it's a week removed, there really isn't a more important message that you'll ever hear.
[time=402] There really isn't a more significant truth that you'll ever get to consider than the great truth of the resurrection. And as you watch not only the music and the worship, but as you hear the message today, even though a week removed, it's as powerful as ever.
[time=419] The message that you'll hear today about the great freeing power of the resurrection and what it offers people like you and me is significant and powerful, it's penetrating, it's life giving a week after Easter, four weeks after Easter.
[time=434] We could watch this message in December and it would be as powerful as it was the day we experienced it here together just this past week.
[time=444] So I hope today, whoever you are, wherever you find yourself in life, whatever your circumstance, I hope you'll watch and listen today.
[time=453] And my prayer is that the great power, the life-changing, eternity-altering power of the gospel.
[time=461] I hope you'll allow it to just sink in to your heart and mind and soul, whatever God has for you today as you watch.
[time=468] We'd love to hear about it. We'd love to help you with it. We'd love to walk alongside you in the days to come.
[time=475] And so as you watch, our hope is that in the days or weeks to come that you'll come and be with us live and in person.
[time=482] I hope you'll chew on these things and I hope you'll contact me. I hope you'll allow this message to impact your life and I hope you'll reach out.
[time=490] We would love to get to know you better. We'd love to help you in whatever ways we can.
[time=494] And so please contact us at the website. Come by in a Sunday morning, nine and ten forty-five. We'll be here.
[time=500] We are every week. We'd love to meet you. God bless you as you take in the Easter resurrection message this morning.
[time=507] And as always, we hope to see you soon. God bless.
[time=515] Let no one call in sin remain inside the lie of inward shame.
[time=527] We fix our eyes upon the cross and run to Him who show great love and glad for us.
[time=544] Freely you've led for us.
[time=550] Christ is risen from the dead, trampling over death by death.
[time=556] Come awake, come awake, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=562] Christ is risen from the dead. We are one with Him again.
[time=568] Come awake, come awake, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=579] Rise up from the grave beneath the weight of all my sin.
[time=591] You bow to none, but heavens will. No scheme of hell, no scoffers frown.
[time=603] No burden, great can hold you down in strength.
[time=611] You reign forever, let your church proclaim.
[time=621] Christ is risen from the dead, trampling over death by death.
[time=627] Come awake, come awake, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=633] Christ is risen from the dead. We are one with Him again.
[time=638] Come awake, come awake, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=644] Oh death, where is your sting?
[time=650] Oh hell, where is your victory?
[time=656] Oh church, come stand in the light, the glory of God has defeated the night.
[time=667] Singing oh death, where is your sting?
[time=674] Oh hell, where is your victory?
[time=680] Oh church, come stand in the light, our God is not death.
[time=688] He's alive, he's alive.
[time=693] Oh he's risen from the dead.
[time=698] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, he's risen from the dead.
[time=735] Come awake, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=738] Christ is risen from the dead, trampling over death by death.
[time=744] Come awake, come awake, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=748] Christ is risen from the dead.
[time=752] We are born here again.
[time=756] Come awake, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=762] Christ is risen from the dead.
[time=775] Christ is risen.
[time=801] Wow.
[time=806] What a powerful sound to hear this room filled with the praises of his people on such a joyous and special occasion.
[time=814] Happy Resurrection Sunday all of you.
[time=817] It's so good to have you here, so good to be together.
[time=820] Would you all just take a minute and just thank Corbin and everybody who's walking off this stage for the hours they spent preparing to lead us in worship this morning.
[time=830] Thank you.
[time=835] I'm sure you've noticed the guys brought up a door right over here to the side and I'd invite you this morning just to think a little bit about a door.
[time=848] Just think about a door, any door.
[time=851] Here's the thing about a door.
[time=853] Whenever you walk through a door, you're going from one place to another.
[time=859] Depending upon what's on the other side, there will most likely even be certain emotions or feelings that come right as you walk through a door.
[time=870] When you walk through some doors, you may have a feeling of excitement.
[time=873] When you walk through other doors, you may have a sense of familiarity.
[time=880] It all depends on what's on the other side.
[time=884] I've noticed just in my own life as I walk through different doors, even with different people, I can be with my wife or I can be with my girls or my boys.
[time=893] We can all walk through the same door and have the exact opposite reaction.
[time=900] There are times when I've dragged my girls with me over to one of the greatest places ever invented, a space basketball fieldhouse.
[time=910] I walk through the doors at space and I just got to tell you, my heart starts to race.
[time=917] I get very, very excited.
[time=919] My girls, not so much.
[time=922] There were times where I dragged them along for those all-day events at Space, six, seven games.
[time=928] After the first half of the first game, with six more to go, they're like, "Please, can we go?"
[time=934] And I love space. I don't think there's a better sound than squeaking tennis shoes and balls bouncing and people yelling and horns buzzing.
[time=944] It is absolutely life-giving. It's invigorating. I love it.
[time=950] And then I can walk with my girls through the door at the mall.
[time=957] And I'm just going to tell you, when I walk through the door at the mall, I get tired.
[time=963] Just walking through the door. I'm exhausted.
[time=968] And I have a theory about this. I think they pump in less oxygen at the mall.
[time=975] I do. I think it's a conspiracy to get you lightheaded and fuzzy, and then you spend more money.
[time=981] It's very, very sad and tragic.
[time=983] But I just walk through that door. I'm a hundred yards down.
[time=987] I walk my girls past Abercrombie first. Then after we get past there, I'll just look at my girls and say,
[time=994] "I'm going to the food court. I need a break." And I just sit down and have a break. Some of you, when you walked through these doors this morning,
[time=1006] some of you, as you came through these doors, you had a great sense of excitement in you
[time=1012] because you have been so looking forward to celebrating the resurrection.
[time=1017] Amen? Some of you, when you walked through the doors here at the church this morning, you had a great sense of anticipation.
[time=1023] The first thing you did was you wanted to come in here and look at what they had done with the room.
[time=1027] And didn't they make it look beautiful today? Yeah, a lot of hard work, a lot of time, a lot of effort.
[time=1032] I'm so thankful for the effort that they made.
[time=1037] Some of you, when you walked through the doors this morning, truth be told, you had some apprehension going on.
[time=1043] It's your first time here. Truth be told, you're just a little nervous.
[time=1048] This is all a little new for you. There are a few others of you who haven't been to church in like forever,
[time=1055] and you felt extremely relieved when you came in because the roof didn't cave in like you thought it would.
[time=1064] The reason, my friends, the reason we chose a door, as the symbol for Easter in the resurrection this morning
[time=1074] is that the resurrection of Jesus Christ provides a door, a door.
[time=1082] And we'll come back to that.
[time=1084] Two thousand years ago, God walked through the door of human history.
[time=1087] History is really, as most of you know, his, what? His story, that's right.
[time=1092] In Easter, my friends, the resurrection of Christ is the focal point of all history.
[time=1098] It truly is. That's why two thousand years later, over two billion people all around the world will celebrate the resurrection this weekend.
[time=1106] And I want to take you back two thousand years to the day it started.
[time=1109] Would you open your Bibles to Matthew chapter 28?
[time=1112] Would you go there? Open your Bibles to Matthew 28. I want to read to you from verses 5 and 6.
[time=1121] It says there in Matthew 28, 5 and 6, the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid."
[time=1127] You can see it on the screens as well this morning. If you don't have a Bible, it's all right.
[time=1131] "Do not be afraid," he said to the women, "for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
[time=1138] He is not here.
[time=1141] He has risen just as he said.
[time=1146] Come, see the place where he was lying.
[time=1149] Friends, the reason Easter is a celebration is because Christ was alive, not dead.
[time=1157] And he's still alive today. And listen, my friends, he wants us to be alive.
[time=1162] Listen, God desires that you would be today fully alive.
[time=1168] Irenaeus, the great church historian, said, "The glory of God is a man fully alive." Jesus says in the Gospels
[time=1175] that he came to give you life that you might live it more.
[time=1178] What? Somebody abundantly.
[time=1182] God's desire is that through Christ you would live a life that weren't literally means overflowing.
[time=1189] God desires that you would live a life in his son that was passionate and purposeful.
[time=1196] The life in which every part of you is alive and engaged with him.
[time=1202] But most people aren't fully alive, are they?
[time=1207] Most are just going through the motions, just existing day after day after day.
[time=1214] Not really living at all.
[time=1219] Do you know why?
[time=1221] Do you know why it is that so many people today and maybe even many of you in the room this morning, do you know why it is that we settle for so much less than what God designed you to experience?
[time=1233] Do you know why that is?
[time=1236] Adam and Eve.
[time=1239] Poor Adam and Eve. They get blamed for everything, don't they?
[time=1242] Adam and Eve.
[time=1244] Adam and Eve were in this perfect environment. It was called Eden, the Garden of Eden.
[time=1249] God said all these doors, if you will, I've created are open to you.
[time=1254] You can walk through any door you want and enjoy life.
[time=1257] There's only one door that's off limits. There is one tree you can't eat fruit from.
[time=1263] And what did they do?
[time=1265] They go straight to that door and walk right through it and disobey and in their sin.
[time=1272] They created a wall, a really big wall between human beings and God.
[time=1279] A wall between God's holiness and God's perfection.
[time=1284] They create this wall in between Him and our sinfulness, our imperfection.
[time=1290] A wall that kills passionate, purposeful, abundant living and creates this fear of God.
[time=1299] And so because of this fear and distance, we actually start trying to live life in a way that keeps us away from God. We want to avoid Him.
[time=1308] In fact, after they sinned, look what Adam said in Genesis 3, 10.
[time=1312] Adam says, I was afraid and what? Say it, hid from you.
[time=1318] Anybody in the room ever tried to hide from God?
[time=1324] You know what? There's probably some people in the room this morning.
[time=1328] And you're trying to do that very thing these days in your life.
[time=1333] That you're here this morning shows your weakening in that effort.
[time=1337] But nonetheless, there are those who try so hard to hide from Him.
[time=1344] It doesn't work so well.
[time=1347] Our wall of sin causes us to be distant from God and alone with our regrets.
[time=1356] You don't have to raise your hands. Any regrets in the room this morning?
[time=1365] Any regrets?
[time=1367] Regret for the wisdom you've rejected in your life.
[time=1372] Regret for the times you've lost your temper and given into rage.
[time=1377] Regret for the day you lost control and went where you never should have gone.
[time=1383] Regret for the years of lost priorities.
[time=1386] Regret for the hour you lost your innocence.
[time=1389] Regret for things said, things done, even things thought.
[time=1393] One stone after another, my friends, sin after sin after sin.
[time=1400] And the wall gets really tall and it keeps us really separated from God.
[time=1408] And the great news, the good news, the gospel news of Easter is that God has provided a way through that wall.
[time=1419] Guess how?
[time=1420] Guess how He provides a way through the wall.
[time=1425] He provides a door.
[time=1427] God puts a door in the wall that allows you to finally be with Him and not distant from Him.
[time=1434] He puts a door in a wall that allows you to finally live a full and abundant life not an empty and futile one.
[time=1442] And I want to talk to you this morning about three doors.
[time=1445] Three realities that come with the resurrection.
[time=1448] Three things that God has provided you.
[time=1451] I hope you'll take notes.
[time=1452] I hope you'll take this in.
[time=1454] Three doors.
[time=1455] The first is the door of forgiveness.
[time=1460] The door of forgiveness. One of the great realities of the resurrection, my friend, is that you and I have been given the privilege of walking through the door of forgiveness.
[time=1469] Go to Matthew 26, if you will, in your New Testament, Matthew 26, verses 27 and 28.
[time=1478] We heard this earlier.
[time=1480] Many of you have heard this many times, but oh, be reminded of what it says here at the end of Matthew 26, 27, and when He had taken a cup.
[time=1489] And given thanks, He gave it to them saying, drink from it all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many, for what?
[time=1501] Say it, Church, forgiveness of sins.
[time=1505] Forgiveness of sins.
[time=1507] Go on past the gospels.
[time=1509] Go to the book of Acts, if you will.
[time=1511] Go to Acts 10.
[time=1513] In Acts 10, verse 4, we'll pick it up in verse 40.
[time=1518] Peter is preaching to Cornelius' household.
[time=1522] It's a powerful scene.
[time=1523] God does amazing things here through Peter's witness.
[time=1527] We'll pick it up in Acts 10, verse 40.
[time=1530] It says, "But God raised Him up on the third day and granted that He become visible."
[time=1536] Not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God.
[time=1540] That is to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead.
[time=1546] And He ordered us to preach to the people and solemnly to testify that this is the one who has been appointed by God as judge of the living and the dead of Him.
[time=1557] All the prophets bear witness that through His name, everyone who believes in Him receives, say it, Church, forgiveness of sins.
[time=1569] Forgiveness.
[time=1571] If you go back to the epistles, go to Colossians.
[time=1575] Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, go to Colossians chapter 2.
[time=1580] It says in Colossians chapter 2, verse 12.
[time=1586] Paul here explaining to the Church Colossae about this rich union between believer and their Lord, having, verse 12, having been buried with Him in baptism.
[time=1600] In which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God who raised Him from the dead.
[time=1607] When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, in other words, in the midst of all of your iniquity and sin, He made you alive together with Him, Christ, having what?
[time=1621] Having forgiven us all our transgressions.
[time=1627] There's a lot of people in this room who love that last line. You're so thankful that He has forgiven how many all of your transgressions.
[time=1638] When Christ died on the cross on Good Friday, all sin and guilt from the past, from the present, from the future was completely cancelled.
[time=1648] No debt. You owe nothing. Sin's penalty paid in full, and you get to experience that forgiveness when you devote your life to following Christ.
[time=1662] The resurrection means there is a door of forgiveness for all of our sins, and that's good news, isn't it, because all of us have sinned.
[time=1670] And sin, listen friends, sin not dealt with. Sin left to itself ruins things with God.
[time=1678] It ruins things with others. It ruins things in us.
[time=1683] Thank God our sin doesn't have to ruin us anymore, amen?
[time=1687] We can be forgiven by a crucified and resurrected Lord.
[time=1694] You know, no matter how clearly I try and explain that, no matter how clearly we try to articulate that to you today, there will always be some.
[time=1702] I've got friends who are in this boat still today.
[time=1706] There will always be some who will say, "Yeah, but you know what? I've got to just figure this out on my own.
[time=1712] I'm going to tear that wall down. I've got to do this myself."
[time=1718] And so you try to tear the wall of regret and sin down on your own.
[time=1724] You try to get rid of it by doing good works.
[time=1728] You try and get rid of it by turning to religion.
[time=1732] You try and get rid of it by keeping rules.
[time=1735] You try to follow regulations and all of that just then adds more guilt and more frustration because the truth is you're just not that good.
[time=1747] And you say, "Well, wait a minute. How good do I have to be?" Well, remember, my friends, remember God's standard. He is completely and wholly perfect.
[time=1762] How good do you have to be to get to God? Remember, a perfect holy God requires perfection.
[time=1770] You know what perfection means? Not one single sin.
[time=1777] It's just how holy. It's just how perfect. It's just how pure. It's just how good he is.
[time=1784] Not one single sin.
[time=1789] So really, don't forget, this isn't bad news just for the D minus guy.
[time=1798] There's this in bad news just for the F.
[time=1801] This is bad news for the 99.5.
[time=1806] Just one.
[time=1808] And we're separated from him forever. God knew we could never be perfect.
[time=1813] That we'd always struggle with sin, so he sends his son to make a way to him through Christ, the unspeakable power of forgiveness in his experience, the door of forgiveness.
[time=1826] I wonder who in the room this morning needs to be forgiven.
[time=1833] The resurrection not only offers a door of forgiveness, my friends, but it also provides us with a door called reconciliation.
[time=1844] The door of reconciliation. Can you write that down? It's a big, long word.
[time=1850] It might be confusing to some, but let me tell you, it's really simple in its meaning.
[time=1855] The word reconciliation means this. It means to restore and mend that which was broken.
[time=1863] To restore and mend that which was broken, reconciliation means to bring back together, to kind of fix and mend and piece back together that which was torn apart.
[time=1877] The resurrection, my friends, offers a door of reconciliation.
[time=1881] Yes, reconciliation for our relationship with the Father, but also listen.
[time=1888] It also brings reconciliation for our relationships with each other.
[time=1896] Last week we talked about the movie called The Bucket List.
[time=1901] We talked about it a little bit in the message.
[time=1903] The whole premise of that movie was Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are told that they're terminally ill and so they make up this list of things they want to do places.
[time=1911] They want to go stuff. They want to experience before they kick the bucket.
[time=1915] They do things like skydiving and race car driving and resort living and they travel the world.
[time=1921] They see it all, five-star, first-class, all the way extravagant, high-end stuff.
[time=1929] And I was thinking about it again this week as I thought about this morning.
[time=1932] In 24 years of ministry I have had, listen, I have had the absolute privilege.
[time=1938] I don't know what else to call it. It's an honor that I get because of what I do.
[time=1946] I've had the privilege and honor of walking with many people at the end of their lives.
[time=1955] I've had the honor of walking with people when they found out they had a month to live.
[time=1959] I've had the privilege of walking with people at the end of a long fight with disease or sickness.
[time=1965] And it's almost never the extravagant or opulent or big things that they have regrets over.
[time=1972] I've never heard anybody say to me on their deathbed and I have stood by many a deathbed.
[time=1978] Nobody's ever said to me, Kelly, I wish I had jumped out of a plane.
[time=1985] Not one person has ever said that.
[time=1989] But what I have heard is regret regarding lost and broken relationships.
[time=1996] That's what I've heard.
[time=1998] I've never heard anybody with their last breath express sorrow over never seeing the pyramids.
[time=2004] But I've watched them gasping for air, wishing their kids were there in an empty room.
[time=2013] I'll never forget being called to the bedside of a very wealthy friend of a friend of mine years ago.
[time=2021] As this man was about to die, this guy had millions in the bank.
[time=2026] He had multiple homes, planes, cars, but his kids hated him.
[time=2031] Friends had deserted him. His family, his whole world had just fallen apart.
[time=2037] He was failing quickly and all his money wasn't going to get him out of this one.
[time=2041] His death was imminent and the full, listen, the full realization of the fact that he had wasted his whole life
[time=2048] was in these last moments hitting him full force.
[time=2052] He said to me, please tell me what I can do.
[time=2055] I've blown it. I've lost everyone.
[time=2059] And you know, it struck me in that moment.
[time=2062] I thought he was going to say I lost every, what, thing, because he had so many of them.
[time=2070] But he didn't. He said, oh, please help me. I've lost every one.
[time=2077] What do you say to a guy at that moment?
[time=2081] Cheer up. It's no big deal. No. It's a huge deal.
[time=2086] And all I could do with him was share with him how he could trust Christ so that his sins could be what?
[time=2094] Forgiven. But how sad.
[time=2097] How sad that he came to the end of his life alone with all those relational regrets.
[time=2105] And he couldn't in those last moments do anything about it.
[time=2110] Relational sin. I just want you to write this down and think about this with me just for a moment.
[time=2114] Relational sin that leads to relational walls.
[time=2118] So many of you in the room have experienced this.
[time=2121] So many of us have built these walls.
[time=2124] Relational sin, things happening that we're not in God's design leading to relational walls in our lives
[time=2131] that keep us from him and keep us from anything meaningful with others.
[time=2137] You get weary trying to please your mom and dad.
[time=2141] And finally you just say I'm done and a wall goes up.
[time=2145] You have argument after argument after argument in your marriage and a wall goes up in your relationship with him or her.
[time=2153] You have conflict with a co-worker and a wall goes up.
[time=2156] You have heartache and trouble with a teenager and a wall goes up between parents and their kids.
[time=2162] We build these walls in our relationships and they tear us apart.
[time=2166] It starts early in life and the walls get built with the stones of rejection and hurt.
[time=2172] You try it out for a team and didn't make it.
[time=2175] You start making poor grades.
[time=2177] Your dad leaves you and your mom or your mom leaves you and your dad and the walls just go up.
[time=2184] You get called a few names.
[time=2186] You don't get invited to the parties.
[time=2190] And the stories, excuse me, the stones don't stop coming in childhood or adolescence.
[time=2195] You get passed up for a promotion.
[time=2197] You get hurt by someone you love and trusted in the wall building just escalates.
[time=2203] It's crazy and tragic when you stop and think about it because we build these walls to protect us from getting hurt relationally and the wall building hurts our relationships.
[time=2218] You know men, not to pick on us, but men are especially good at building these relational walls.
[time=2224] I came across in my study this week a children's book entitled The Night in Rusty Armor.
[time=2231] It's about this night that goes and fights all these great battles and victories.
[time=2236] But the night is so used to wearing his armor that when he comes home he doesn't know how to take off his armor
[time=2243] and his family can't get close to him.
[time=2246] So many men are in this boat today my friends out in a volatile workplace with so much on the line
[time=2252] trying to keep up with the sales force clawing and scratching their way through the daily battles of their vocation
[time=2258] and a lot of men, a lot of you men in this room this morning don't know how to come home and take the armor off and be real and warm and engaging.
[time=2267] And sometimes there's conflict with a wife who makes it difficult.
[time=2271] I understand to have all that God designed you to have but whether it's men who can't get out of their armor
[time=2278] whether it's a woman who struggles with issues of trust or control
[time=2284] it weakens and hurts our relationships leaving us distant from the very thing God created.
[time=2292] Listen, because of the resurrection there is a door of reconciliation that heals fractured relationships.
[time=2302] If we choose to walk through it.
[time=2304] Now you're sitting there this morning thinking wait a minute you're telling me Easter can help my marriage.
[time=2310] Absolutely.
[time=2314] Watch this.
[time=2316] Once you have walked through the door of forgiveness and there are no more walls between you and God
[time=2326] once that's transpired you get a real distaste for walls.
[time=2332] And so now when you have a relationship problem with someone it bothers you.
[time=2336] It didn't use to but now it does because now you've tasted of forgiveness.
[time=2340] Now you begin to understand with him what intimacy and honesty and trust can look like.
[time=2346] Once you've experienced forgiveness with him reconciliation with others becomes so much more inviting.
[time=2352] You've been forgiven much and you want to now reach out and forgive more.
[time=2357] You want to be the first to call you want to follow God's lead and offer a door of reconciliation
[time=2363] mending bringing back together that which has been torn apart.
[time=2368] Is this possible?
[time=2371] Could it really, could it really be that in your life and the mess you find yourself in the midst of
[time=2379] that Easter that resurrection could make a difference?
[time=2382] How in the world could you do this?
[time=2385] You're thinking well Ephesians 1 I love it it says how incredibly great is the power.
[time=2390] How incredibly great his power is to help those who believe in him.
[time=2395] Please don't miss the significance of that.
[time=2398] How incredibly great his power is to help those who believe in him.
[time=2404] It is the same mighty power that raised Christ from the what?
[time=2410] From the dead the good news of Easter.
[time=2413] My friends is that the same power that raised Christ from the dead and reconciled you to him is
[time=2419] available to help you in your marriage to help you in relationship with your kids to help you
[time=2425] with your parents to help you with the people at your work.
[time=2430] Relationship with a resurrected Savior can reconcile all that's fractured and broken in your life.
[time=2441] Well hey there's one more one more wall we need to talk about.
[time=2445] It's a big wall and most people don't talk about it much it's called death.
[time=2454] Death and it is I think it's safe to say a universal problem.
[time=2462] Death only a fool some would say and I would agree only a fool would go through life unprepared for
[time=2470] something he or she knows is inevitable.
[time=2474] Let's just check that real quick.
[time=2476] Everybody in the room who believes death is inevitable raise your hand.
[time=2480] Only a fool would go through life unprepared for something he or she knows is inevitable.
[time=2488] We may live here on earth for 50 what 60 70 80 every once in a while you get a 90.
[time=2495] No guarantees though but one thing that is guaranteed.
[time=2499] Hebrews 9 says it is appointed for man to die once.
[time=2506] Death is going to happen and eternity my friends is forever.
[time=2511] We live in an uncertain world with terrorism and war and diseases but because of the resurrection
[time=2517] of Jesus Christ God said you don't have to be afraid of death you can be prepared.
[time=2523] The third door my friends is the door to heaven.
[time=2527] The door to heaven heaven heaven heaven heaven what do you think about when I say the word
[time=2533] really what do you think about when I say the word heaven what pictures come to your mind.
[time=2539] Word is your where does your head go when you think about this place called heaven.
[time=2546] When some people think of heaven they think of sitting on a cloud forever in a white gown
[time=2552] coming a harp to me that actually sounds like the other place but we won't talk about that.
[time=2557] Bible says that the new heaven and the new earth will be very real very real the new
[time=2566] heaven and the new earth God's word says will be very real we will it's going to be the
[time=2574] most fulfilling the most beautiful the most inspiring awesome place one could ever comprehend
[time=2580] or imagine will live in utter perfection forever nature will be perfect our activity will be perfect
[time=2586] our worship will be perfect our relationships will be perfect and we will do it all take it all in forever with absolute fulfillment and joy all in the presence of God forever real place real stuff
[time=2602] it's not a painting it's not a poem it's real and what I want to make sure at least we remind
[time=2610] of this morning is that forever eternal living is real you will you will live forever that's not
[time=2622] a question the question is what where with with who because of the resurrection there is a door
[time=2634] to eternal life in heaven and so you might be sitting here this morning many were first hour
[time=2640] it was amazing you may be sitting here this morning and okay well wait a minute tell me about this eternal life how does this happen how does one experience or how does one secure for himself
[time=2653] or herself eternal life jesus said it himself in john 17 3 this is the way to have eternal life
[time=2661] could it be any clearer huh could it be any clearer jesus said this is the way for you to know you
[time=2669] have eternal life by knowing you this is jesus in the context of a prayer to his father in heaven
[time=2676] by knowing you the only true god and that word knowing is so important it means it means intimacy
[time=2684] it means closeness it means a proximity that brings enormous clarity and true accurate
[time=2693] insight by knowing you the only true god and knowing jesus christ the one you sent to earth
[time=2702] how is eternity secured by knowing the lord by knowing him
[time=2710] hell just try it this way it worked first hour i hope it works second um maybe just a brave visitor today every visitor's heart just dropped to their shoes
[time=2724] you're just just got you know one brave visitor who maybe has watched the bible hour maybe it's

[time=2787] my failures guess who knows all my faults guess who knows me in proximity and intimacy right here if this is all about knowing him and eternity clint's on the outside looking in my
[time=2799] friends make sense have a seat and here's what i want to say this morning if there's anybody in
[time=2806] the room and you know about him you know you know about him kind of kind of know who he is
[time=2816] it's not going to get it done right here jesus says you want to have eternal life you got to know
[time=2823] me like be like really close to me relationship so how does one get to know the risen lord i'm
[time=2834] going to ask corbin to come up at uh at this time and i'm just going to ask if you would to just
[time=2840] bow your heads just bow your heads and close your eyes just take a minute here with me we got just like we got a few left just bow your head might be the last quiet moment you're going to have all day amen so let's just have it right now i want you to bow your heads i want you to close
[time=2855] your eyes if you would how does one get to know the crucified and risen lord how does one come to
[time=2869] have an intimacy and a closeness with him that brings eternal life
[time=2875] how does one come to know without doubt without question
[time=2883] our risen lord who offers forgiveness reconciliation in the door to heaven
[time=2894] well it happens when you're willing to submit to and follow a risen jesus
[time=2900] and not you it happens my friends when you're willing to submit to and follow a risen jesus and
[time=2908] not this culture it happens when you're willing to submit to and follow a risen jesus not popular
[time=2915] opinion or direction it comes when you're willing to submit to and follow a risen jesus and not
[time=2929] fears oh it would be my hope
[time=2938] it'd be my hope and so many of us here at black aqua have prayed for weeks
[time=2948] that you would today understand the greatest and and most central truth of the resurrection
[time=2956] and that is this look at the look at the screen if you will john ten i told you we'd come back to the door john ten this is jesus speaking my friends this is jesus
[time=2970] speaking and jesus says i am the what say at church i am the door if anyone enters through me
[time=2978] anybody enters through me he will be what saved that's the good news doesn't matter who you are
[time=2993] doesn't matter where you've been doesn't matter what you've struggled with you know that that wall
[time=3000] is big and getting bigger the separation just continues to grow and God in your futility
[time=3007] and hopelessness and sense and you know what i love you so much i'm going to give you a what say a door and here's the thing the forgiveness and the reconciliation
[time=3018] and eternity all of those doors made possible when somebody's willing to enter through the one door
[time=3029] that makes it all possible and so this morning i'm going to give you an opportunity not a high pressure deal it's just going to be you on your own thinking this through three three groups of
[time=3040] people this morning there may be somebody here today i bet there's a bunch who for the very first
[time=3047] time you may want to just with all the courage God would give you for the very first time walk down this aisle and walk through this door and in doing so say i want to fully surrender my
[time=3058] heart and life all of it not just a part of it every bit of me i want to surrender to him i want to follow him and not me i want to follow him and not my fears and not my addictions and not this world
[time=3068] the first time you can just walk right down here when we close today we're going to have people
[time=3074] waiting down front and you can enter into the kingdom of heaven and all the forgiveness and all the reconciliation and all the hope you could ever dream of there are others of you who have
[time=3086] walked through this door before you have it's a few years ago or maybe many but things have gotten
[time=3095] difficult you've made choices that you wish you hadn't and somehow this thing just got sideways
[time=3102] and you feel a million miles away from from a god who you know loves you and even though you've
[time=3109] walked through it before maybe today you want to just come back down and walk through it again you just want to walk through that door again and you want to just re-clarify and restate
[time=3119] it's not like the first one didn't take we you just want to come and and before him say oh god
[time=3125] i'm sorry and i i want some help we'll be down here to pray with you about that help and encouragement that you might need there are others of you who know him who know him but this morning you just
[time=3141] could use some prayer maybe a relationship isn't at all what you know god wants it to be maybe you
[time=3147] need that that healing power and strength maybe you need to be encouraged in your faith but there's nothing more important than this right now so i want to give you a chance as Corbin
[time=3160] sings listen listen to him as he sings this great truth one more time you just bow your heads again
[time=3167] and just invite you to listen and let God prompt you let God lead you let the Holy Spirit speak to
[time=3173] you and then as we go i'm going to give you a chance to come on down but listen first for a while will you
