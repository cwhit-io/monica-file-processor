[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Well hello everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It's great to have you with us.
[time=36] As most of you know, I have, and our ministry here at Black Hawk has an enormous appreciation for the church of Fort Wayne.
[time=43] Not just ours, but all that God is doing through so many churches in this arena.
[time=48] You know what else though, besides churches, there are a number of ministries that God has grown up in this region that in my opinion are doing phenomenal work and a lot of you may not know about them.
[time=60] And there is one this morning that I want you to meet.
[time=63] I want you to meet the ministry and I want you to meet the guy that's behind it.
[time=66] I'm so thankful to have Mark Terrell here with us this morning.
[time=69] Mark is the CEO of Lifeline Youth and Family Services.
[time=73] And I've known about Lifeline, gosh Mark, I've lived in Fort Wayne for 15 years.
[time=80] It wasn't long after I came here.
[time=82] How old is Lifeline?
[time=83] - Almost 40 years.
[time=84] - Yeah, I came here 15 years ago and one of the first things I learned about was what you guys do and the way in which you serve not only families and kids, but the kingdom, in my opinion.
[time=95] And I've just always appreciated what you do.
[time=98] The longer I've been in Fort Wayne, the more I feel like there's a lot of folks that don't know what you do and they may recognize the name Lifeline.
[time=107] And I just wanted today to take some time and let you kind of just share with us the vision, the mission, kind of the big picture of what Lifeline is about.
[time=117] I think there's a lot of people out there that would love to know more about it.
[time=119] - Right, well first of all, it's important to know what our mission is.
[time=123] Our mission is changing hearts and bringing hope to a generation at risk.
[time=126] And a lot of people say, what's that mean?
[time=128] - Changing hearts and bringing hope to a generation at risk.
[time=132] I love that.
[time=133] - And what that means is it's based on two scriptures.
[time=135] One out of Matthew that says, what comes out of a man's mouth comes from his heart.
[time=139] And we really believe if we can change the heart, not us, or the Holy Spirit can change the heart of these kids, we can change their lives.
[time=147] And so many of our kids are without hope.
[time=149] I've never been without hope.
[time=150] I've never always had someone I can call.
[time=151] I knew when my next meal was coming, we really believe the combination of changing their heart and that the Holy Spirit and that God has a hope for them in a Jeremiah 29 level and their favorite verses.
[time=162] And that's really what we're about.
[time=164] And a lot of times people say, can you give me a little bit better understanding what it means?
[time=167] We're all about the family.
[time=169] And we do that in a lot of ways, but we found out about several years ago, a statistic came out that 75% of every male and female in prison today.
[time=178] The number one reason is the dysfunction of their family.
[time=181] - Wow.
[time=182] - So we have really, everything we do is about the family.
[time=184] And in the past, most of what we did was with kids that were part of the court system.
[time=188] This year we're gonna wear about 12,000 kids all over the state of Indiana.
[time=192] - Wow.
[time=193] - And most people have no idea what we do.
[time=194] - See that right there would be a shock.
[time=196] - Yes.
[time=196] - I think to a lot of people in our community, 12,000 kids.
[time=200] - Yes.
[time=201] - All over the state.
[time=202] - Of Indiana.
[time=203] - All over the state.
[time=204] - You guys you're engaged with.
[time=205] - Absolutely.
[time=206] - Wow.
[time=207] - And it used to be lifeline was really known as a place where when kids got in trouble, they would be sent to a facility or a place where to live.
[time=213] And we still have those.
[time=214] We have kids that live with us 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
[time=218] They're with us for a lot of reasons.
[time=220] And I tell people generally two reasons.
[time=222] One is kids have made bad decisions 'cause kids do make bad decisions.
[time=226] But a lot of kids are with us because they come from situations of abuse and neglect.
[time=231] And that used to be a lot of what we did.
[time=232] And we have a brand new campus in Pearson, Indiana that's designed specifically for these kids in mind.
[time=238] But years ago, we started to realize we do great work with these kids and then we'd send them home.
[time=243] - Yeah.
[time=244] - And then two or three months later, we'd see them again.
[time=245] - Wow.
[time=246] - And we do really good work with them and we send them.
[time=247] And I found out that it wasn't 'cause they missed me.
[time=250] It didn't miss our food.
[time=251] - Yeah.
[time=252] - That if we didn't do something in that home, we were in trouble.
[time=254] - The family.
[time=255] - And what's happened is we, this week, we'll be in 1200 homes two to three times a week.
[time=261] Rather than removing the kid, we are actually going into the home working with the entire family.
[time=266] - Wow, that's awesome.
[time=267] - And it has changed what we do.
[time=270] - Wow.
[time=270] - And we've seen, last year we were 82% successful keeping families together.
[time=275] - Together.
[time=276] - So we really believe that if we can do that, we can make a huge difference on that 75% number.
[time=282] - 82% - 82% successful.
[time=284] - I wish the church was that successful.
[time=286] - Yeah, well, and we're not successful with all of them.
[time=288] - Well, I know, that's just really encouraging.
[time=290] - Yeah, so.
[time=291] - That's really encouraging.
[time=292] - But the thing for ministry, and I think it's important, there are a lot of really good organizations out there and some of them are faith, but most of them aren't.
[time=299] They were started with a biblical foundation and they've kind of walked away from that.
[time=304] And it's sad, I mourn that because they have forgotten that God is a powerful God and He can change their lives forever.
[time=313] - Some of the things we do, I mean, there's a lot of things we work with kids from all walks of life.
[time=317] We work with kids from whether they're in drugs or alcohol or whether they're dealing with sexual issues or crimes of all sorts.
[time=326] But what we're finding is a lot of times people have said, "There's no way to help these kids." I don't believe that.
[time=332] I serve an all powerful God that says, "I can help." - Yeah.
[time=335] - And that's something that's really important, but one of the things that's also interesting for years, people have called me, that their kids are not in trouble yet.
[time=344] And they said, "Help." And in the past, there really was no solution.
[time=348] It was very expensive, there wasn't anything available to them.
[time=351] And just in the last year, we have taken what we've done in the core of those 1200 homes.
[time=356] We now have opened it up to families that are not in trouble.
[time=360] I personally thought, what a crime for a parent to say, "I have to wait until my son or daughter commits a crime before they can get help." That's wrong.
[time=369] - Yeah.
[time=370] - And more and more of our work in the past has all been court.
[time=373] It's more and more of our situations work with kids that are part of the church.
[time=378] Counselors, schools are sending kids to us, and it's really, really important.
[time=381] - So if I'm a parent, and I'm watching this right now, and I know my kid is at risk.
[time=389] I know there's things going on that I don't have the tools to help address with him or her.
[time=395] I can actually call Lifeline.
[time=397] - Yes.
[time=398] - And you guys would be willing to come alongside.
[time=400] - Right.
[time=401] - Me as an individual parent.
[time=403] - Absolutely.
[time=403] - Wow.
[time=404] - That's cool.
[time=405] - And the great thing is, a lot of times parents, in fact, I had my board one day get on the internet and say, I gave them a fake family and said, "I want you to do research on drugs or whatever." And it's not that there's not information out there.
[time=418] There's too much information.
[time=419] - Yeah, yeah.
[time=420] - 300,000 hits for marijuana or whatever, central, you know.
[time=425] And what we've found is one of the things, the best things we can do are help families put a plan together.
[time=430] It may be that we send them to a counselor that's a great counselor here in town or maybe we're in the home working with the counselor and the family.
[time=438] I have four children and three boys and someone told me one of my kids walks like me and one of them has a facial expression like me and Apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
[time=448] And sometimes the good things and sometimes the bad things.
[time=450] And it isn't that they're bad parents.
[time=453] It's not that they're bad kids.
[time=454] Sometimes they just need help.
[time=456] - No, absolutely.
[time=457] - So that's a big part of what we do.
[time=458] - How large is your staff?
[time=460] - We have almost 300 staff.
[time=461] - 300 staff all over the state.
[time=463] - All over the state.
[time=464] - Wow, you're located here in Fort Wayne.
[time=466] - Yeah, of course.
[time=466] - But obviously you get around the state.
[time=468] - Yeah, we take kids from all over.
[time=469] We're in every single county in the state of Indiana.
[time=472] Our corporate office is here in Fort Wayne.
[time=475] We have some facilities here in Fort Wayne as well.
[time=477] We have an independent living program here in Fort Wayne for boys because sometimes we weren't successful with 18%, sometimes kids shouldn't go home or sometimes the family is so fractured.
[time=490] They need to learn to be independent.
[time=492] And one of our goals is either to help that keep that family together or help those kids start a family.
[time=497] Their own family because you know what?
[time=499] If we don't, these kids are gonna be part of our system.
[time=502] We're gonna be paying for them the rest of our lives.
[time=504] - Yeah, wow, praise God.
[time=506] Well, hey, as you listen, I know it's fascinating stuff.
[time=509] I know you're encouraged.
[time=510] I know I am.
[time=511] On the bottom of the screen here, you see the Lifeline website information.
[time=516] You can click on there and learn some more.
[time=518] I know there's ways in which you can contact these guys to not only learn more, but even maybe ask for help.
[time=525] Thank you, my friend, for being here.
[time=527] We're still thankful for what you guys do.
[time=529] Thank you for tuning in today.
[time=530] As always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=532] God bless.
[time=533] (upbeat music)
[time=546] [MUSIC - 41 seconds]
[time=601] Before we head into or back into our study of First Timothy, my friends, I want to invite you to please open your Bibles.
[time=608] I want to share with you something this morning that took place earlier this week.
[time=614] It is really an opportunity for us to be what I believe God has designed us to be and that is a family.
[time=621] Most of you who understand family know that there are times when in family there is great joy and celebration.
[time=629] Others, if you know that there are times with family where there is heartache and sorrow and the need to encourage.
[time=635] Let me read to you before we catch up this morning.
[time=638] Let me just read you Romans 5-3.
[time=640] Romans 5-3 actually begins really with Romans 5-1.
[time=645] Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have, anybody know what it says?
[time=652] Peace, we have peace with God.
[time=656] Through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we also have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace.
[time=664] Look what it says in verse three.
[time=665] And not only this, but we exalt in our tribulations.
[time=669] Knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance and perseverance brings about proven character and proven character brings about what?
[time=680] Say it, church, hope.
[time=682] And hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
[time=694] I love how that chapter starts.
[time=695] Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace.
[time=700] We have peace.
[time=703] Middle of the week, I got a call from our good friend Corbin Miller.
[time=708] He and Tanya had just earlier that morning, visited the doctor for a routine ultrasound.
[time=714] And some of you know this, others of you don't, and we just want it as a family.
[time=718] Pray for them in the days to come, that routine ultrasound ended up being anything but routine and it was detected there that day and then confirmed the next day on a second ultrasound that the little life inside Tanya's womb, a little girl, has no brain.
[time=736] And so as they looked at that and as they considered that and met with and talked with doctors and family and friends and I had the privilege of sitting and talking with them at length, they are certainly nor would we in any way.
[time=753] Believe that God couldn't do something miraculous
[time=759] but physically, medically speaking, that is a lethal prognosis is what they call that.
[time=767] That just isn't any brain.
[time=769] And so more than likely if all of that plays out, two and a half months from now come July, Tanya will give birth and that little life won't last very long.
[time=785] And we will do all that we can, you and me as a family,
[time=791] to walk with them and to encourage them and to pray for them and to lift them up.
[time=796] We will do everything we can to remind them of our good God and even though it is confusing and boy it has been confusing for them.
[time=808] Most of you know, Corbin and Tanya, they're good kids, I call them kids, they are faithful and they love God and they believe in God and they serve God.
[time=820] And this is just something that as you would expect it stretches us and it challenges us and I'm so proud of how they're handling this and they're trying their best to honor him.
[time=831] And you know, we talk a lot about Corbin talks often from this stage, he leads us in songs about and you know me, I stand and we proclaim often the great providence and sovereignty of God, don't we?
[time=846] You understand providence, it's the will of God.
[time=850] We believe that God has a will, amen?
[time=854] We believe that God has a plan for us, amen?
[time=857] And we talked Corbin and Tanya and I, we talked in the night in their living room about how difficult it is at times when having proclaimed that plan, you come face to face with that plan and it's not what you would have wanted, it's not what you would have desired, it's not at all what you ever would have dreamed.
[time=879] And yet it is his plan.
[time=884] And so they are doing their very best to walk that road with him.
[time=889] And I think all of you would understand his absence, their absence from our family today, they're not running from anything, I guarantee you that.
[time=898] They just need a little bit of space to take a real deep breath and kind of figure out these next few weeks.
[time=905] They are scheduled to leave next Monday, a week from tomorrow.
[time=909] This has been planned for months, the way the Lord would have it.
[time=912] They were scheduled to leave for the Czech Republic to do a conference for a great ministry over there, Josiah Venture.
[time=923] And so they're, I think today, they're gonna do the music for that conference and minister to young people.
[time=930] And I think in classic Corbin and Tanya form, they're trying to kind of figure out if, in fact, they can do that 'cause they'd like to go and serve.
[time=939] She's not immediately in any danger.
[time=942] They've clearly decided to carry this baby full term.
[time=946] If that's the will of God, amen.
[time=948] And that's what I think's a great just reminder for all of us.
[time=952] I'm so proud of their character and integrity in a day where they were given options to do other than that.
[time=959] They believe that it is God who gives and it is God who takes away and they'll just trust.
[time=966] I heard someone say nature to run its course.
[time=968] You and I know it's not nature running its course.
[time=971] It's God running his course.
[time=974] And he will determine all of that and they will simply try to follow that course as best they can.
[time=980] So pray for them, pray for courage, pray for a deepened trust in a God who they love but are confused by, I think, in some ways in these moments.
[time=993] And we will, this morning, we'll pray for them right now.
[time=996] I'll invite you to do that in the days to come.
[time=999] We'll give them the space that they need.
[time=1001] They'll be back next week.
[time=1004] And we want to just do all that we can to embrace them and encourage them.
[time=1008] And I believe God will give you and me the wisdom to do that in ways that are appropriate and right.
[time=1016] Let's pray.
[time=1016] Our Father in heaven, we're thankful for what Romans 5.1 says that because of the faith you gave, Corbin in Tanya, and because of the justification that came through their Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, your Son, whose resurrection and whose promise and whose hope we celebrated last week, God, Romans 5.1 says that they can have today peace.
[time=1044] They can today experience, in reality, the fact that it's all going to be in your time and place.
[time=1055] Okay, peace.
[time=1057] And while they don't experience that circumstantially or experientially at moments today, oh God, we pray, that you would give that to them in the days to come.
[time=1069] We pray for Lori and Dave Miller.
[time=1072] We pray for Tanya's family up in Jackson, Michigan.
[time=1076] We pray for brothers and sisters, all of whom are doing their best to come alongside and support.
[time=1081] Oh God, I pray for this family as we do our best to come and stand with them.
[time=1086] Sometimes that is just the best thing we can do is just walk with them, offering them our love and our support and our prayers.
[time=1096] God, we trust you.
[time=1099] We need to proclaim that and want to state that again today that we know your ways aren't our ways.
[time=1105] We know that there are times where what is divine is so different than what is human.
[time=1110] We know that what is providential and sovereign at times is so distant from what we would understand or desire.
[time=1118] And God, we admit that to you this morning and yet we proclaim again our allegiance to you and our willingness to do what we can for these that we love.
[time=1128] And everybody in the room agreed and said, amen.
[time=1133] [AMEN] Well, hey, would you turn in your Bibles?
[time=1136] Please to 1 Timothy chapter four.
[time=1138] We come back to our study of this letter from the Apostle Paul to his true child in the faith, Timothy, Timothy, a young pastor, pastoring in Ephesus.
[time=1149] And we come to an extremely interesting, thought-provoking phrase right here out of the gate in chapter four, verse one.
[time=1157] I've entitled the message why some go back out the door.
[time=1162] Why some go back out the door?
[time=1166] And you know what's interesting?
[time=1168] I had him keep the door from last Sunday and sitting right up, right up here.
[time=1172] And the reality of this, and you'll see it as we come to the first verse of chapter four, the reality is that in 23 plus years of ministry, on Sundays just like last Sunday, I have had the absolute privilege of in settings like this and in my office in a restaurant booth in a youth event in all kinds of settings.
[time=1199] God's given me the privilege of seeing people.
[time=1201] Walk down an aisle, raise a hand, voice their commitment, walk through the door.
[time=1207] Jesus said, John 10, 9, I'm the door.
[time=1209] Anyone who enters by me will be saved.
[time=1211] The interesting reality is I have watched for years, people go through the door.
[time=1219] And for years and years and years, I've seen that go really, really, really well.
[time=1227] But there have been times and there are instances and I could develop quite a list for you of individuals who three weeks later, oftentimes three months later, sometimes three years later are gone.
[time=1242] They're gone.
[time=1246] They for a number of different reasons have walked in essence and I'm just in a message on eternal security.
[time=1254] So I don't wanna confuse you here.
[time=1255] I'm just saying there are those who walk through doors and end up walking back out that door.
[time=1261] There are those who you welcome in with all the hope and excitement of a transformed life in a new day who six months, a year, two years down the road didn't get transformed.
[time=1275] They're not here, they're gone.
[time=1279] And it, over the years has always been something that has hurt my heart, it's confused me at times, says in 1st Timothy 4.1, it says, but the spirit explicitly says that in latter times, and I'll just tell you right now that phrase latter times refers to the time period from the first coming of Christ until his return.
[time=1308] It's the time period between the first coming of Christ and the second coming of Christ.
[time=1315] And those days would be these days, these days that we find ourselves in.
[time=1321] It says the spirit explicitly says that in those days, some will, there it is my friends, fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons.
[time=1334] By means of hypocrisy of liars.
[time=1337] There we see the false teaching of this world seeping back into the church.
[time=1342] Paul's been dealing with this with Timothy for several chapters.
[time=1347] There was this strong propensity of worldly teaching that was trying to again make its way back into the church, the hypocrisy of liars.
[time=1357] Not only false doctrine, but just worldly thinking.
[time=1360] And it captivates and eventually it says here leads others astray.
[time=1367] They fall away from the faith by means of the hypocrisy of liars, men seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron, men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth.
[time=1386] So what happens?
[time=1388] What happens back to the beginning of chapter four and those who fall away from the faith?
[time=1397] Why do some who walked through the door end up walking out?
[time=1402] And it leads me this morning.
[time=1404] It has all week led me to wanna just share with you some things that I believe the scriptures teach and things that we have those of us in ministry, myself included who over the years have seen this reality again and again and again.
[time=1415] It leads me to wanna share with you and teach you this morning some things.
[time=1419] I think that are helpful and insightful and important for us to understand when it comes to those who make a profession of faith.
[time=1430] It might be your 10 year old, it could be a 30 year old.
[time=1435] My goodness, what a joy last week to stand here after both services and see just individual after individual family after family, to see people get up out of their seats having been reminded of the great hope and freedom found and arisen Lord and they came through this door and we met with them and we talked with them and we prayed with them and there were so many who came to fully surrender their hearts and lives to Jesus Christ and my mind has been on them all week.
[time=1464] My mind has been on others who I have known in recent months have made a commitment to Christ.
[time=1469] My mind is on little ones who I know and I'm aware of who are making commitments to love and follow Jesus all the days of their life.
[time=1479] My mind goes to these people and I read here that there are some who will fall away and it's just driven me to come before our Lord and do my very best to bring to you, I hope today some things that will be helpful in this discussion.
[time=1495] Here you go, three things.
[time=1496] Why do some who walk through end up walking out?
[time=1499] Here's what I've seen and here's what I've experienced, my friends, foundations.
[time=1503] Sometimes it happens because foundations don't get laid.
[time=1506] Sometimes it happens because walls don't get built.
[time=1510] Sometimes it happens because a covering is never established or embraced and I want to explain all of these to you this morning.
[time=1520] But before I do that, let me just read to you from first John, turn there if you would to first John.
[time=1525] This just kind of says it again in different wording, different terminology, but here is the same heartbreaking reality.
[time=1532] First John two, verse 18 says, children, it is the last hour.
[time=1537] There it is again, latter days.
[time=1540] And just as you heard that anti-Christ is coming, even now many anti-Christs have appeared, from this we know that it is the last hour.
[time=1551] They went out from us, but they were not really of us.
[time=1557] For if they had been of us, they would have remained with us, but they went out.
[time=1564] So that it would be shown that they are all not of us.
[time=1569] Let me read my notes to you here at the bottom of my Bible where it talks about those who fall away from the faith, those who fall prey to the false teachers, those who fall prey to the message of this world will abandon the Christian faith and the community of faith that they've been attached to.
[time=1591] The Greek word for fall away is the source of the English word apostasize and refers to someone, listen, moving away from an original position.
[time=1601] He uses these words on purpose.
[time=1605] It has to do with someone moving away from an original position, from an original perspective.
[time=1611] These are professing Christians who associate with those who truly believe the gospel, but in time defect after believing lies and deception, thus revealing their true nature as unsaved.
[time=1631] Well, why is it that there are so many who fall away?
[time=1635] Why is it my friends that there are so many who believe lies and deception?
[time=1642] Foundations don't get laid.
[time=1646] Walls don't get built.
[time=1647] The covering is never established.
[time=1651] Pray with me, would you Father, in heaven as we delve into these thoughts and these truths, dear God, I pray that you would speak in ways that only you can.
[time=1660] Well, God, I pray that you would remind us, I pray that for others, you would do a work in them today that would be new, that would be not only mind, but heart expanding.
[time=1671] Oh, God, I pray that you would do a work today.
[time=1674] And those who are responsible for caring spiritually for others in their own family, God in their own life.
[time=1682] Father, for those who know you and maybe have recently come to know you this morning, I pray that you would do a work that would establish foundations and provide for them a stability that would allow their love for you and their commitment to you to only grow.
[time=1698] Thank you, Father, for the privilege of opening your word today, thank you for the great truth that it has.
[time=1705] May we understand it and may we most importantly do it in the days to come in your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1713] Foundations, let's start there.
[time=1716] Sometimes folks turn around and walk the other way because foundations aren't laid.
[time=1723] What do we mean by foundations?
[time=1725] I hope you'll write this down.
[time=1726] Next to foundations, I hope you'll write the word strength.
[time=1730] I hope you'll write the word stability.
[time=1733] Just write those two words down.
[time=1734] Write next to foundations.
[time=1735] Write the word strength and stability.
[time=1737] Here's what we mean.
[time=1738] There must be, my friends, there must be personal when someone comes to faith in Christ, whether it's your son or daughter, whether it's a 50 or 70 year old, it doesn't matter.
[time=1750] When someone's new to the faith, there must be personal, intentional training for a life of following Christ.
[time=1758] A foundation must be laid spiritually that they will be able to draw from, that they will be able to stand on, that they will be able to benefit from in the days to come personal, intentional training for life.
[time=1775] A life of following Christ, this must be provided.
[time=1779] I have friends involved in ministry.
[time=1782] I have friends who attend other churches and some of those friends have over the years talked to me and I've heard them mention and talk back and forth about the catechism that goes on in their church.
[time=1794] And you know, there was a time when I would say to them, "Hey, tell me about that." What do you mean, catechism?
[time=1800] What goes on there?
[time=1801] And they would just explain to me that from a very young age, kids were brought into a setting where they were lovingly, faithfully, consistently, without hesitation, without apology, taught and built into given the foundations of their faith.
[time=1818] Nothing's missed.
[time=1819] It's comprehensive, it's systematic, it's regular, it's consistent, and as the years go by and as they get older and older and older, they continue to be fed the truth.
[time=1831] They begin to be indoctrinated in a good way as it relates to their faith.
[time=1836] They begin to be prepared for a lifetime indoctrination.
[time=1844] Depositing into their minds and hearts the great truths.
[time=1847] It's no different in principle.
[time=1854] It's no different than what goes on with terrorists.
[time=1858] You understand this, right?
[time=1860] It's why they give their, what, lives.
[time=1865] It's why they give their lives for crazy stuff.
[time=1869] It's why they give their lives to something that most folks look at and go, what in the world, why would you ever do that?
[time=1877] Well, different scenario, I understand, but you know what, it might not be such a bad idea for the world to look at you and me and for the world to look at those who we train and say, why in the world would they do that?
[time=1892] Why would they love their wives so faithfully?
[time=1897] Why would they hold so tightly to the scriptures as the word of God, why would they live so honestly?
[time=1903] Why would they be so committed to kindness and generosity?
[time=1907] Why? Because they got trained.
[time=1910] They got it deposited into them from the very beginning and it didn't stop.
[time=1917] And I would just say to you in the room this morning that in some ways I think we have failed at that.
[time=1923] I know many of us are trying to get better at that and this is an individual idea and this is also a corporate principle as well, how are you doing on this front?
[time=1933] How are we doing on this front?
[time=1937] And so I want to just do better at it.
[time=1938] I'm thinking about those who came forward Sunday.
[time=1941] I'm thinking about some of the many conversations that we got to have this week and follow up to what happened Sunday.
[time=1947] And I want to just, I want to say to all of you in the room, whether you came forward or not, but especially if you did and they're going to have this up on the screen right now, we just got with our team and we put this together.
[time=1960] It wasn't supposed to happen this quick, but now it has.
[time=1963] Faith basics, who was Jesus?
[time=1964] What did he accomplish?
[time=1966] Is the Bible credible?
[time=1967] What does it mean to have eternal life?
[time=1968] These questions and more are answered in a unique six week journey into the basics of the Christian faith.
[time=1974] As designed for those who are new or newer in their faith are those who may need a spiritual reminder, this smaller group study will take place starting May 15th.
[time=1985] She got a couple of weeks to sign up and I would encourage you as mom and dad.
[time=1989] I would encourage you as student, high school, college age.
[time=1993] I would encourage you as a high schooler, junior hire.
[time=1996] I would encourage you who have come to faith recently.
[time=1998] I would encourage those of you who maybe it's been a while.
[time=2002] You need to be reminded.
[time=2003] We need to be teaching you and equipping you with the great truths of what is the foundation of your faith and relationship with Christ.
[time=2012] You can sign up for Faith basics, my friends, today out in the lobby afterwards, there will be a Faith basics sign up kiosk, you can visit ask questions, you can also go online and email Chuck Nelson, one of our elders, his information is there on the screen and we would love to see as many of you as possible in an opportunity just like that.
[time=2032] Foundations, number one, there's got to be a personal, very intentional training experience, training that's for a life, a following Christ.
[time=2042] Secondly, an unwavering devotion.
[time=2043] Here's a foundation for you.
[time=2045] There needs to be an unwavering devotion to the local church.
[time=2048] We need to teach you that.
[time=2050] You need to understand that the great value, the great benefit of an unwavering devotion to the local church.
[time=2060] Listen, listen, this is about family.
[time=2062] I'm talking about family, not a building.
[time=2066] Do you understand?
[time=2067] We're talking about relationships, not an organization.
[time=2073] And this family and these relationships gather on a Sunday morning at nine and 1045 and in smaller settings in ABFs and small groups during the week, but I want you to understand that when you instill in someone's heart and mind from the very beginning, the great value of the body of Christ, it helps.
[time=2096] I could get out a piece of paper, draw a line down the middle and guess what?
[time=2103] After 23 plus years of ministry, I could make a really long list of people.
[time=2107] I can make a really long list of individuals and couples and families who never made that commitment and it hurt 'em.
[time=2115] Destroyed 'em.
[time=2118] There was no foundation, there was no stability, there was no sense of family, there was no community.
[time=2124] Write this down, there's strength and belonging.
[time=2128] I hope you'll write this down.
[time=2130] There's strength in belonging.
[time=2132] There's health in community and there is failure in autonomy.
[time=2137] And that is true.
[time=2140] There is real strength in belonging, my friends and there is real health to be experienced in community and there is failure waiting for you and me, the day we think we can live without this.
[time=2154] And I can also on that sheet of paper make a long list of families and individuals who have thrived and grown and experienced God's blessing because they would not allow themselves to get detached.
[time=2169] They stayed together.
[time=2173] Listen, I'm not talking about going to church, I'm talking about being connected to the church, but understand being connected to the church does require you to go to what, to church.
[time=2191] I had this brought to my attention in a very powerful way on spring break this year.
[time=2196] And I needed to stand here and confess to you all, I don't know if it's like really something I have to confess, but I don't mind saying it to you.
[time=2204] I have not in all of our 18 years, 19 years of parenting, while we've done it at times, I just want you to know, I have not made it a practice of going to church, of gathering with other believers when we're on vacation.
[time=2220] I just haven't, and honestly, there are times where I just want to get away from church.
[time=2229] And I think you would understand that as I say it, but this time around, we're on spring break down South Carolina, and my wife actually said something to me, Friday-ish, and she said, "How about we just do it?" And I said, "You know what, that's a good idea, it just is, "let's just do it." And so we're driving around Friday and Saturday, and we, I didn't think it was gonna be a big deal, I announced to the kids we're going to church on Sunday, and it was almost mutiny.
[time=2259] And it was kind of funny, at first I was upset, but then I was kind of touched because we told them, "Hey, we're gonna go to church on Sunday." And they just said, "No, no!" They're like huddling up together, like, "Stay away, "we're not going." And I'm like, "What in the world?" And then they said, "It's not Black Hawk, it's a cult." (audience laughing) And they were sort of overdoing it, but there's really this sense in them where they just love this place, it's literally all they've ever known, and so we're in South Carolina, and I'm driving by, this was really cool, it was a three, it's the oldest, check this out, it's the oldest standing church building in America.
[time=2303] It's like 300 something years old, it's the first Presbyterian church of St. John's Island, South Carolina, and it was just magnificent and beautiful,
[time=2318] and I'm driving by and say, "We're going there," and they're like, "No!" (audience laughing) And so we're just, I think Presbyterian kind of freaked them out, and they're like, "What's that?
[time=2329] "What are they?" So we come to Sunday, I'm telling you, Sunday came, and we walked into that place, and all four kids just huddled together, kind of talking to each other, "Watch your back, I got you in the front here." And you know what, it was the, it was just the coolest, most special, really genuinely encouraging worship experience I've had,
[time=2355] and just, you know, it was just fantastic.
[time=2357] It was an old, old deal with the huge pulpit up in the front, covers the whole front wall, and all the seats were in like boxes, the old pews where you had kind of a compartment, you said, and that freaked them out, they thought they were getting sectioned off, and anyway, I just left that day, they left smiling, they left singing, they left shaking the pastor's hand with the big robe at the door, and we just had a phenomenal time.
[time=2383] And you should, I just went to bed that night thinking, you should do it, I should just do that.
[time=2388] We should just always go.
[time=2390] It should just be part of who we are, wherever we are.
[time=2393] We should just try to go and exercise the discipline of gathering.
[time=2396] It really helps.
[time=2398] It helps when you do it here, and it helps when you do it elsewhere, and so it was just a great, great lesson learned.
[time=2403] Foundations have to be laid, my friends.
[time=2405] Personal, intentional training by parents, and the church, and unwavering devotion to the local church needs to be established from a very early age.
[time=2417] And here's one more I wrote down, there needs to be a redefining of the end game.
[time=2421] That's right, there needs to be a redefining.
[time=2423] For those who come to faith in Christ, there needs to be a redefining of the end game.
[time=2428] What do I mean by that?
[time=2430] Well, what's the message that our kids are learning these days?
[time=2435] What's the message, my friends, of this culture of ours?
[time=2438] What is it that our kids are seeing?
[time=2442] What is it that you as an adult, as you might be coming to faith for the first time?
[time=2446] What message have you been taught, and what is it that you've embraced when it comes to what's the end game?
[time=2453] In other words, like what's this life all about?
[time=2456] Where am I supposed to be going?
[time=2457] What is it that I'm supposed to be going after?
[time=2460] Well, first Corinthians 1031 says, and I love this, it says in first Corinthians 1031, whether you eat or drink in whatever you do, I think it'll be on the screen here for you.
[time=2470] Whatever then, whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the what?
[time=2476] Say it.
[time=2477] Say it again.
[time=2479] The glory of God, and that's sometimes a phrase we sort of slip over quickly.
[time=2484] No, don't slip over, don't pass over that quickly.
[time=2486] What it says is that the end game for you and I, as believers, is we are to bring glory to God.
[time=2494] Our lives and what we do, our lives and what we say, our lives and how we live.
[time=2500] Wherever He takes us, whatever our hands find themselves doing, the whole thing is to be bottom line at the end of the day about glorifying, bringing honor and bringing glory to Him.
[time=2512] Our lives, we get to live them and do all that we do to make much of Him, not who, us.
[time=2522] What's the message that our kids are learning?
[time=2528] You know what they're learning?
[time=2528] They're learning this.
[time=2529] Right job, right car, right circle of friends, right house.
[time=2534] And it gets us to stop and think,
[time=2542] and I hope you will, what's life about?
[time=2544] Is it about the right life?
[time=2546] Is it about, listen, is it about the quality of life or is it about a mission in life?
[time=2554] And I think it's about a mission, a mission of sacrifice, a mission of compassion, a mission of making much of Him, not us.
[time=2567] We gotta help them redefine the end game.
[time=2571] This life isn't about happiness for me.
[time=2574] It's about helpfulness towards others.
[time=2577] We gotta build foundations, my friends.
[time=2580] We've also gotta build walls.
[time=2582] I know last week I just spent the entire morning telling you how walls are bad.
[time=2587] These are different walls.
[time=2588] That was the wall between us and God that God made a way through in the door of Christ Jesus, our risen Lord.
[time=2596] But I wanna talk to you this morning, just briefly here, about the walls of protection.
[time=2602] I think there are levels of appropriate protection.
[time=2605] I'm not one of those guys who thinks that we've gotta run around our families just making everything safe and docile and easy.
[time=2614] No, it's not me, and I don't think that's wise, but I do think appropriate levels of protection, evidence, wisdom.
[time=2623] There are foundations that need to be laid in walls that need to be built.
[time=2627] Here's a couple of walls.
[time=2628] I hope you'll just write these down.
[time=2630] Number one, I think it's important to help young people, especially in the early years of their faith, and it's actually very important for older people who are new to the faith, to help them understand the great value of God-minded, God-honoring friendships.
[time=2645] Amen?
[time=2646] God-minded, surround yourself with God-minded, God-honoring friends, 1 Corinthians 15, 33, says it so well, do not be deceived.
[time=2657] Now, why do you think it started?
[time=2660] Why do you think he says that?
[time=2661] Don't be deceived.
[time=2664] He says don't be deceived, because listen, one of the great tactics of the enemy on this front is to absolutely obliterate and destroy believers through the influence of others.
[time=2677] And he says do not be deceived.
[time=2680] Bad company corrupts good morals.
[time=2687] We just, we chuckled first hour talking about this.
[time=2690] I just asked the question, what's bad company?
[time=2693] Well, bad company is anything that's not what?
[time=2696] Good company, and good company is company that honors God.
[time=2699] Good company is company that wants to please him.
[time=2703] Good company is company that wants to point you in the right direction.
[time=2706] Good company is company that challenges you and encourages you in the appropriate directions on all fronts, that's good company.
[time=2716] And bad company is company that doesn't.
[time=2719] And bad company corrupts your best intentions.
[time=2724] And it's important that you hear me say this, my friend's bad company corrupting good morals.
[time=2730] Listen, I'm not just talking to 13-year-olds, am I?
[time=2734] I'm talking to 50-year-olds.
[time=2737] I'm talking to grown adults who come to faith in Christ.
[time=2741] You need to understand that who you're with, and their influence and their words and their values and the stuff they're about and the places they're going.
[time=2751] Very important.
[time=2752] Do I want to shelter you and pad you and put you in this world that's completely, absolutely separated from anything real?
[time=2760] No, no, no.
[time=2762] Corrupts gets us interesting.
[time=2764] Corrupts good morals.
[time=2766] When you study that in the original language, that speaks to intimacy.
[time=2771] It speaks to proximity.
[time=2773] It speaks to being really close and being really close often enough that all this stuff gets so, so no, we're not saying you can't have some buddies.
[time=2784] I've got a lot of friends.
[time=2787] Anybody who knows me knows I got a lot of friends that are really, really far from God.
[time=2791] I'm not intimate with them, and I don't spend all my days with them, and I'm not out with them.
[time=2800] You follow me?
[time=2803] But I love them and I know them, but I'm not going to let them get close enough to me to corrupt me, and you shouldn't either.
[time=2811] We've got to teach those, especially at the beginning of their journey, the value of God-minded, God-honoring friendships.
[time=2818] Can you always control this as they get older?
[time=2821] Answer?
[time=2822] Any parent over the kids over the age of 18?
[time=2825] No, no, you can't.
[time=2828] But you can sure instill this in them, and those who come to faith later, the same truth can be instilled.
[time=2835] Secondly, on the walls, on the protection front, intentional boundaries need to be established.
[time=2842] For those new to the faith, for those walking through the door of salvation, no matter how old they are, we need to teach them, and help them understand the great value of intentional boundaries being established in their life.
[time=2857] What do I mean by boundaries?
[time=2858] Lines, appropriate lines that should be drawn with regard to a long list of things that you can probably just begin to think through.
[time=2869] There needs to be some parameters.
[time=2871] There needs to be some boundaries.
[time=2873] There needs to be some help given to those who are now trying to live life in this world of ours in a way that honors him.
[time=2881] Boundaries and lines as it relates to entertainment, song lyrics, boundaries and lines as it relates to social media, boundaries and lines drawn as it relates to social activity, boundaries and lines as it relates to technology,
[time=2904] 'cause there's so much good that can come from it, and there's so much evil that can creep in as well.
[time=2909] Boundaries and lines that can help a young person new to their faith or a 40-year-old new to their faith, boundaries and lines that can help them with relationships.
[time=2919] There are some in the room this morning who would be shocked.
[time=2923] There are others of you in the room who wouldn't be, but the fact of the matter is that more and more young people who I interact with than have the privilege of spending time with, I'm watching more and more young people today, more than 10 years ago, more than 20 years ago, who are entering into pretty serious intimate relationships with unbelievers, people who don't share their faith and commitment to Jesus Christ.
[time=2951] It's becoming more and more passe, it's becoming more and more acceptable.
[time=2956] I don't know who by, but I hear that a lot.
[time=2962] And I start to feel really old and gray when we have the conversations, and I'm so grateful for so many of them who still want to hear from us and ask me questions about this because that's when you have the chance to sit down and talk with them about the practical realities of one who is in and devoted to the truth of God's word and a life of following Christ and all that that brings and one who isn't committed to those things and isn't devoted to Him and doesn't care really about those truths and they like each other but they don't share foundationally and to them, it's like, you know, it's really gonna be all right and then you just try and talk with them about how it really maybe won't be all right and it gets really, really complicated and really, really ugly at times and it's hard.
[time=3012] You might be shocked by that.
[time=3014] You might be shocked by the fact that more so than 10 years ago and more so than 20 years ago, now more and more of them are not only dating but they're living together, more than ever.
[time=3024] Like really good kids, they come and sit down, we talk, I say, hey, I know she got the same address.
[time=3030] Yep.
[time=3030] And I'm so grateful for their honesty.
[time=3034] Do you understand that?
[time=3036] I don't reach across the table and backhand anybody.
[time=3038] I'm thankful for their honesty and in their honesty, they're telling me, is that a big deal?
[time=3048] And then you begin to realize, wow, a lot of foundation didn't get laid.
[time=3054] You with me?
[time=3056] A lot of walls never got established.
[time=3059] A lot of good, healthy boundaries and lines never got explained.
[time=3064] And so now you're telling me this and I'm gonna say, yep, it's a big deal and let's talk about it.
[time=3071] And I'm so grateful for those who have enough courage and character to sit there and talk with me about that.
[time=3076] Sometimes for weeks and to see what some of them do in light of that, a couple of weeks ago, I did a wedding.
[time=3085] Guess where?
[time=3088] My office.
[time=3091] Guess when?
[time=3093] After that conversation.
[time=3096] New believers who said, oh, wow, are you serious?
[time=3104] Oh, we don't wanna, we don't wanna do that.
[time=3107] We wanna honor God.
[time=3108] And I said, well, let's get married.
[time=3109] And they said, okay.
[time=3110] And they actually came back a couple weeks later
[time=3117] and they had told who they needed to tell and they just said, we're doing this.
[time=3120] And friends said, what are you doing?
[time=3121] And they said, nope, we're gonna do this.
[time=3124] Stood there in my office across the street two weeks ago and got married.
[time=3127] And then went home and did dinner in bedtime for the kids that they've got just an incredible story.
[time=3134] We gotta lay foundations.
[time=3136] There's gotta be walls built.
[time=3139] Good walls.
[time=3140] First Corinthians 6, 12.
[time=3142] It's so important that they understand this.
[time=3144] I love what it says, all things are lawful for me, but we gotta help them understand that not all things are what?
[time=3150] Profitable.
[time=3151] All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by anything.
[time=3155] And so it is for us to help them stay away from those things that will master them.
[time=3159] It's for us to help them understand that there is a difference between what is permissible and what is best.
[time=3166] And I want for my kids and I want for your kids and I want for a new believer as they start out this journey, I want them to have a desire to do what is best in God's eyes and we can help them in that way.
[time=3180] Hey, we gotta go.
[time=3180] Last one, let me just tell you this, covering.
[time=3182] What do I mean by covering?
[time=3184] Well, I kind of left you hanging on that one, but what I mean, I hope you'll write this next to the word covering.
[time=3189] I hope you'll write down the word authority.
[time=3192] And I'll just say this briefly.
[time=3194] Here's a question that we've got to ask people new to the faith.
[time=3197] Here's something we have to instill in them as they start this journey.
[time=3202] Who or what will be their ultimate authority in their life?
[time=3212] Those who spiritually figure this out early, thrive and grow, those who don't struggle.
[time=3219] And what do I mean by figure this out?
[time=3221] What I mean is this, James 4-7, look at James 4-7, 8 and 10.
[time=3226] Submit there for to who?
[time=3228] Say it, church, there it is.
[time=3231] You and I have gotta help our dear friends and our dear kids understand that life is about submitting to God.
[time=3238] Does that sound bad?
[time=3241] Does that sound like no fun?
[time=3242] Doesn't have to, but it's the truth.
[time=3245] A life yielded to a life willing to be submitted to God.
[time=3248] Resist the devil.
[time=3249] He will flee from you, draw near to God and he will draw near to you.
[time=3254] Cleanse your hands, you sinners and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
[time=3258] I think it goes on in verse 10.
[time=3260] In verse 10 do you have verse 10 up there?
[time=3263] Well, we'll say verse 10 for later.
[time=3264] God, elders, pastors, parents, wise counsel.
[time=3270] I've just got that written down in my life.
[time=3275] God, elders, pastors, parents, wise counsel.
[time=3286] Every kid in this room, every young person in our family here at Blackhawk, every new believer ought to understand that there is an authority structure that God has given to them that will help them thrive and grow and the day they think somehow they can last out from underneath that covering that God has granted will be the beginning of heartache and trouble and strife.
[time=3310] And so foundations need to get laid and walls need to get built and a covering needs to be embraced and when we do this it gives folks a chance.
[time=3318] It really gives them a chance to walk through doors and never come back out and experience a life with him that he designed them to live a life of fruitfulness and blessing and joy and heartache and challenge that he uses to grow them as his children.
[time=3339] Amen?
[time=3340] Let's stand and pray this morning.
[time=3342] As you leave today, there'll be white buckets on the way out and most of you know by now that white buckets at Blackhawk mean an opportunity to give toward those in need and we've got a high school team and a great team of adults going over to Nairobi to the orphanage to our orphanage that we partner with over their new life home trust and we want to just take an offering over these next few weeks to help that trip and help those kids and their experience.
[time=3369] So any spare change, any small bills you want to drop in there, feel free to do so.
[time=3375] Our Father in heaven, oh God we pray that you would give us great strength and courage to be a people who with those who we have direct responsibility for in our homes and for those God that we have direct responsibility for in this family, for those new to the faith, for those beginning in their journey, and could we please with your help be able to provide foundations and walls and the awareness of an authoritative covering that would help them and assist them in their life and their relationship with you?
[time=3405] God I pray that you would give those young people and you would give those young believers a willingness and an openness to this.
[time=3412] And oh God I pray that you would give others of us who know you and have walked with you the desire, God to come along and help them.
[time=3420] God give parents in the room courage.
[time=3423] God give them the willingness and the where with all to make decisions as it relates to their parenting that would allow them to invest truth with great courage and with great conviction.
[time=3435] Oh God I pray that you would be with us as a staff and elders as we provide settings like faith basics.
[time=3440] I'm so thankful for Chuck and others who will help in that process.
[time=3444] May we do all that we can to build into those who have come to faith in your son, the kind of foundation, the kind of beginning to their relationship and walk with you that will sustain them for years.
[time=3457] Oh God we know all of this is up to you.
[time=3460] We know all of this remains under your power and we pray God you'd exercise it.
[time=3464] Thank you so much for the privilege of being together today for the joy of worship.
[time=3469] We lift up Corbin and Tonya to you.
[time=3471] We will throughout the week, praying God for your comfort and your help.
[time=3477] They need it so desperately and we pray God that you would bring it and we look forward to being together again soon with them and with each other and all the people agreed and said amen.
[time=3489] God bless you.
