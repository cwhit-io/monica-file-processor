[time=878] Hey, if you would open your Bibles to first Peter chapter two, would you do that?
[time=882] I want to talk to you this morning, moms, and dads, you can listen, and kids, you're welcome to tune in.
[time=889] I think there's a lot of things that we'll talk about today that are appropriate and applicable across the board.
[time=895] This morning, I want to talk to you moms about being priestly, moms.
[time=899] And as I just say that, I know that there are some of you, actually, I know that there are many of you in the Blackhawk family.
[time=905] When you hear me say priestly, you understand exactly what I mean, but there are others of you who may not understand what I mean by priestly.
[time=913] You hear the word priest, and your mind goes to a certain place and paints a certain picture.
[time=918] Let me just clarify for you what we mean around here when we talk about the great privilege that we have as believers, of functioning as priests.
[time=929] I want you to see what it says there in 1 Peter chapter 2 verses 9 and 10, 1 Peter chapter 2 verses 9 and 10.
[time=939] But you are, here is God's word to us, my friends, but you are a chosen race, he says.
[time=946] Here he speaks of the people who constitute the church, the body of Christ.
[time=951] You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possessions so that you, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
[time=969] For you, you priesthood, you body of believers, you were not a people, but now you are the people of God, a royal priesthood.
[time=979] You had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
[time=984] And right there in the text, my friends, it tells you what priests do.
[time=989] Priests are those who represent God. Priests are those who proclaim the excellencies of God.
[time=998] Priests are those who, and we've said it to you for a number of years now, priests are those fully surrendered followers of Jesus Christ who because of their relationship with the son and the father are now given this unbelievable privilege of passing along God to others.
[time=1016] What do we mean by that? Priests get to pass along, they get to proclaim and talk about, they get to live out, they get to transfer to others, the excellencies, the character, the attributes of God.
[time=1031] God's compassion gets passed along, God's truth gets passed along. What a privilege for you and for me.
[time=1042] As those who are fully surrendered, we get to live our lives as priests representing God to the people, if you will.
[time=1053] Some of you get to do that in the marketplace. Some of you get to do that at school.
[time=1063] Some of us in the room, I get the privilege of passing along God every week of my life.
[time=1070] It happens to be my vocation, but as a believer I get to do, it's almost like a double dip, it's like his bonus.
[time=1078] I get to do it as a believer, but then you pay me to do it.
[time=1082] It's really, really encouraging and I'm so thankful.
[time=1086] So many of us get to be priests in a number of different settings.
[time=1090] Moms, mothers, today I want to remind you that you get the privilege as a mom of passing along God to your children.
[time=1104] Moms, you get to be priests.
[time=1107] And I want to talk to you this morning and encourage you as it relates to being a priestly mom.
[time=1112] One of the greatest and most glorious privileges of motherhood is the opportunity God gives a mom
[time=1119] to model for those in her care his great love and devotion, the unfailing nurture of God.
[time=1128] And the tender care of our God is so many times experienced in the lives of children young and old
[time=1135] because of a mother's faithful willingness to be like God in a child's hour of need.
[time=1143] Mothers are, I love this, mothers are conduits of God's love.
[time=1148] You are moms.
[time=1150] You are uniquely positioned by God to both reflect and radiate his heart.
[time=1157] God's heart for boys and girls young and old.
[time=1162] And so this morning ladies, what I want to do is just in the time that we have, I want to just remind you of some things that I think most of you know.
[time=1170] Maybe teach others of you some things that you may not.
[time=1173] But as it relates to being a mom who faithfully passes along God to others,
[time=1179] there are some things that you will need.
[time=1182] There are some things that will have to be present in your life and your heart and soul for this to go well.
[time=1189] If you're going to be a priestly mom, you will need, and here we go.
[time=1192] I want to just rattle through them real quick and then we'll come back and look at each one.
[time=1195] Ladies, if you're going to be a priestly mom, you will need grace.
[time=1199] You will need physical strength and health.
[time=1201] You will need wisdom and courage.
[time=1203] You will need intrusive levels of accountability and humility.
[time=1208] And you will need increasing, ever-increasing levels of intimacy with God.
[time=1214] And let's just go back to the beginning and jump in, okay?
[time=1217] Moms, here we go.
[time=1218] If you're going to be a mom that passes along God, ladies, you are going to need grace.
[time=1224] Now think about it.
[time=1226] Think about this.
[time=1227] In most situations that I'm aware of, when it comes to moms and their lives,
[time=1234] no one sees more failure.
[time=1238] No one sees or experiences more defiance.
[time=1241] No one sees more disobedience.
[time=1243] No one encounters more bad attitude.
[time=1246] No one shoulders more disappointment tension and frustration than a mom.
[time=1254] There's a lot of joy in her life.
[time=1257] This is true.
[time=1258] But there is also by virtue of the role she plays, by virtue of the way God wired her, by virtue of what she sees and what she interacts with and how all that comes together.
[time=1269] What a mom faces is awfully unique.
[time=1272] And there are times, many times, when what she faces.
[time=1275] It's heartache and failure and trying to figure out how to keep going.
[time=1280] You see, moms, they feel, not that dads don't.
[time=1284] But moms in a unique way, they feel deeply.
[time=1289] And they long for their sons and daughters to be obedient.
[time=1294] They long for their sons and daughters to do well.
[time=1297] Every mother I've ever met.
[time=1299] They've just got this longing in them.
[time=1301] They want so desperately for that little guy, that little girl or for the lot of them.
[time=1306] You know, they want them to do well.
[time=1308] They want them to do well as a mom.
[time=1309] They want them to do well at breakfast with their manners.
[time=1311] They want them to do well in the van, in the back seat on the way back and forth from practice.
[time=1316] They want them to do well at school with their grades.
[time=1319] They want them to do well in their relationships and friendships.
[time=1323] Moms, they want their kids to do well with God.
[time=1328] Moms, amen?
[time=1331] And from those precious toddler years to the tears of graduation,
[time=1340] these are the challenges of adulthood.
[time=1343] Sometimes kids don't do well.
[time=1348] Do they?
[time=1350] All along the way, they're just our times when they just don't do well,
[time=1357] and so a mom needs grace.
[time=1362] What's grace?
[time=1364] Unmerited what?
[time=1366] Favor, the ability to offer favor, the ability to offer kindness when it's not merited.
[time=1379] You as a mom will face days when you'll need more grace and kindness than you can ever muster.
[time=1386] Days of disappointment, days of great concern, days of repeated failure,
[time=1394] you'll need the grace of God, you'll need the mercy that God provides,
[time=1402] you'll need it to pass along to an eight-year-old, to an eighteen-year-old, to a forty-eight-year-old.
[time=1412] I think about my own mother today, Gail, who day after day after day, these days,
[time=1421] is a twenty-four-seven caregiver for her ninety-six-year-old mother, who is still sharp, body breaking down, but mentally very much still there, and my mom bathes her and changes her and does her hair and walks her and plays cards with her and does puzzles and puts her to bed and helps her take her naps,
[time=1442] and my mom just offers grace day in and day out,
[time=1448] day after day, week after week, month after month.
[time=1452] Moms, you need that, don't you?
[time=1454] And aren't you thankful this morning? Look with me at Hebrews.
[time=1457] What an encouragement this is.
[time=1460] Look at Hebrews chapter four.
[time=1463] And I want to just read this to your mothers in the room.
[time=1466] Obviously all of us can find great encouragement from this, but Moms, remember,
[time=1473] remember where your grace comes from, and remember, Moms, how accessible it is,
[time=1479] and remember the one who grants it for we do not have, it says in verse 15, for we do not have a high priest, now you're a priest, right?
[time=1487] But don't forget you have a high priest, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, for we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without what, sin.
[time=1503] Therefore, Moms, draw near with confidence to the throne of grace,
[time=1509] so that you may receive mercy and find grace to help in your time of need.
[time=1517] God's grace made possible through His Son, who so many of you have a relationship with.
[time=1524] So you're not alone in your endeavor, you're not alone in all that you face, and grace is available for you to obtain from Him so you can pass it along to them.
[time=1535] But Moms, listen, last point on this one, listen, and I know this is true, not only do you as a mom need grace from God to pass along to them
[time=1546] because they need your grace in all the stuff that goes sideways, but you as a mom, I know you, and you know me, and we're kind of in this together, you need grace for your own failure, don't you?
[time=1564] Yes, we're a conduit that gets to pass it along, but as that grace comes to you, you get to experience it as well, and oh, you need it, don't you?
[time=1575] And so as one who has experienced the unmerited favor of God, you get to pass along the unmerited favor to those in your care and what a great reminder and what a great encouragement for you this morning.
[time=1588] If you're going to be a priestly mom, ladies, you're going to need His grace.
[time=1594] If you're going to be a priestly mom, you're also going to need physical strength.
[time=1601] This I am convinced of, this I know now.
[time=1604] I am an expert, I have watched it as we've parented for 19 years.
[time=1608] Moms need physical strength to do their job.
[time=1613] It is physically demanding.
[time=1616] Do you understand this?
[time=1618] Physical strength to be a mom, to do all that God has called you to do, to be all that God has called you to be.
[time=1625] Yes, you need spiritual godliness, but you need physical strength.
[time=1631] It was interesting, a couple years ago I was traveling with my son at an AAU
[time=1637] basketball tournament, we happened to be in Las Vegas.
[time=1640] He was playing there with a team from, made up of boys from Michigan, and I didn't know any of the boys didn't know any of the families.
[time=1648] It was just kind of a one tournament deal.
[time=1650] So there I sit in the gym that day and in walks and sits right next to me, Juwan Howard, and I know this isn't very mother's dais, but just bear with me.
[time=1661] Into the gym, and there's a picture of Juwan right there.
[time=1663] Into the gym walks, Juwan Howard.
[time=1665] And those of you who don't know who Juwan Howard is, what rock have you been living in?
[time=1669] Never mind.
[time=1670] If you don't know who Juwan Howard is, he played basketball at Michigan in the early 90s.
[time=1675] He was part of the Fab Five that so much has been made of back then and even more recently.
[time=1682] But Juwan Howard played from Michigan, played in the Fab Five, and now has ever since like 93.
[time=1690] Okay, you do the math.
[time=1692] Since 93, he's been playing professionally in the NBA.
[time=1696] And he's like 38, 39 years old, and he's still playing.
[time=1700] They call him Old Man River.
[time=1703] And he's still playing.
[time=1704] And I mean, he's playing, playing.
[time=1705] I mean, he's really, really still getting after it.
[time=1708] So I'm sitting there talking to Juwan Howard.
[time=1710] It was kind of fun.
[time=1711] But I started to ask him, like, you know, what that's been like and how he has prolonged his career and what kind of things has he done.
[time=1718] And clearly he's in like, you know, he walks in in the, you know, the shorts and the tank top.
[time=1722] And he's just this chiseled, I'm there in my big hooded sweatshirt and baggy pants.
[time=1727] And I'm like, I'm talking to him about it.
[time=1730] And I got to this point where we weren't even so much talking about how he stayed in shape.
[time=1734] But I asked him, why?
[time=1737] Why do you keep doing this?
[time=1739] After all these years.
[time=1740] I mean, don't tell me you're broke.
[time=1742] I mean, I know you've probably got all the money and need.
[time=1744] Why do you keep working so hard?
[time=1747] And I'll never forget.
[time=1748] He just looked at me and he just said, listen, he said, I get to play in the NBA.
[time=1759] And I understood that.
[time=1761] And I want you to understand this morning how really utterly insignificant that is.
[time=1770] And ladies, how utterly significant it is that you get to be a mom.
[time=1781] Ladies you get to be a mom.
[time=1783] Oh my, you get to invest truth and love and life into young ones who become older ones.
[time=1792] Moms, you get to come alongside and offer the friendship and leadership, the discipline and guidance that goes into the spiritual formation of one who someday God wants to use
[time=1803] to transform their world.
[time=1806] Oh, what you get to do is so much more significant than some prolonged career.
[time=1813] Here professionally in whatever sport or arena, oh, you get to be a mom.
[time=1822] And so I hope you will prolong your career.
[time=1826] I hope you would do nothing to shorten it.
[time=1830] I hope that you would take care of 1 Corinthians 6, 19, says that your body is the temple of the hoop.
[time=1836] Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1839] God has given you your body.
[time=1840] Now listen, this is not me trying to get you on P90X.
[time=1843] This is not me trying to get you chiseled like Joanne.
[time=1848] But I am trying to tell you as a mother, you have a responsibility.
[time=1852] You have a stewardship with your body and your physical life and do everything you can
[time=1859] to be strong.
[time=1860] Do everything you can with his help to be healthy.
[time=1863] Do everything you can to take care of what God has given you so that for years and years and years and years you can be a mom.
[time=1873] [AMEN - 1 seconds] You are going to need grace.
[time=1877] You are going to need physical strength and health.
[time=1880] Mom, here is another one for you that you are going to need wisdom.
[time=1885] You are going to need wisdom and you will note that I kind of put a slash and we added courage there.
[time=1891] And I want to explain that to you, Mom, if you are going to be a priestly mom, you are going to need God's wisdom.
[time=1900] Now I have a theory on this and I will just share it with you and this is just my perspective.
[time=1909] As a priest, you get the honor and privilege of passing along God's wisdom to your kids.
[time=1914] And here is how this works.
[time=1915] You as a woman, you started a young age as a girl and young lady.
[time=1918] You live life.
[time=1920] You walk maybe with the Lord.
[time=1922] You take in His truth over the years, people invest that in you.
[time=1927] Make mistakes.
[time=1928] You get corrected.
[time=1929] You get mentored and discipled along the way.
[time=1932] You learn as you go and one day a doctor places a baby and a little blanket in your arms in the delivery room and boom, there you go, you are a mom.
[time=1945] There is something about you, mothers, that I have just come to believe over the years.
[time=1954] Now, take the infant season out of this because I think all of us struggle with the infant
[time=1964] season.
[time=1965] Nobody knows what to do with an infant, that whole thing, the newborn thing, it is kind of tough.
[time=1970] But once you get past the infant thing, I feel like women are just uniquely gifted.
[time=1979] You have this wisdom.
[time=1982] You have this discernment.
[time=1984] You have this intuition.
[time=1985] There is just something really special about you as a woman and the way God made you and
[time=1991] what comes to little ones.
[time=1992] And I know you are not perfect and I know you make mistakes and all of you would raise your hands and say, "Yeah, well, but I have had a lot to learn." Well, I know, but there is just something special and unique about you.
[time=2001] You have wisdom and whatever wisdom you lack, you know, James 1-5 says that he is willing
[time=2007] to give you wisdom, wisdom that comes from above.
[time=2010] James says in chapter 1 there and he gives it generously.
[time=2014] And so I have got this theory and it is not just about moms, it is with dads as well, but it is Mother's Day so we will just talk about it as it relates to moms and we will come back and hit it again on dad's day.
[time=2026] But here is my theory.
[time=2029] It is one thing to have wisdom, it is one thing to have intuition, ladies, it is one thing to kind of in your mind, deep down, kind of know what is going on and you see what should happen.
[time=2041] It is a completely different thing to have the courage to do it.
[time=2047] There is a difference between your motherly wisdom, which I think a lot of you have, and
[time=2053] the courage to implement the wisdom.
[time=2058] And if you are going to be a priestly mom who passes along the attributes and character of God to your kids, you are going to have to be so many times courageous.
[time=2069] You know down in your hearts, I know you do, you know as a mother, just practically speaking,
[time=2076] you know that they should obey you the first time you ask them.
[time=2085] Not because you read it in a book, not because you heard it in a seminar, there is just something in you.
[time=2091] You know that obedience should be quick.
[time=2096] And yet too many times there you are and there I am yelling the eighth time, popping gaskets
[time=2105] and losing our cool because so many times back at the first time we lacked the courage
[time=2111] to do something about it.
[time=2114] So moms, you are going to need courage.
[time=2116] You know in your hearts, mom, you know that they should look people in the eyes when being spoken to.
[time=2122] You know they should put cell phones away when in conversations.
[time=2126] It is going to take courage for you as we move from toddler issues to adolescent issues.
[time=2132] You are going to have to exercise courage for that wisdom God has given you to be implemented.
[time=2140] Moms you know, you know down deep in your heart that they should stay completely distant
[time=2146] from physical or sexual involvement as adolescents, you know they should stay away from intimate
[time=2154] levels of relationship as young girls and young boys because you know young girls and young boys don't know what they are doing with intimacy.
[time=2163] You know this and you are going to have to exercise courage as you implement these things.
[time=2170] You know that as they get older they should serve, physically serve and help out in and around the home on a regular basis.
[time=2180] Moms you know, you know and when any boundary gets pushed God has made available to you
[time=2188] not only the wisdom but the courage that he provides to implement those things in a way that builds into that young boy, that builds into that young lady, that builds into that young man, the character and the integrity that God designed you to give to them.
[time=2204] Mom, if you are going to be priestly, you are going to represent God, you are going to need grace, you are going to need strength, you are going to need wisdom and courage to
[time=2214] implement it and let me just say this, you are going to need, and I hope you are open
[time=2220] to this, you are going to need intrusive levels of accountability, intrusive, it is a big word, we use it intentionally here just to try and communicate to you, ladies and again
[time=2234] dads this would go for you and I as well.
[time=2236] There is accountability that is soft, there is involvement from others that is somewhat
[time=2243] hedged, there is, people who come alongside and walk with you but they only walk with
[time=2250] you in certain places, does that make sense?
[time=2254] Moms I think if you want God's best for you as a mom and if you want God's best for you in this process of passing him along to your children, there has got to be a willingness in you for intrusive, very personal levels of accountability.
[time=2269] I wrote two things down here, number one, it has always been weird for me, it has always been sad and I do not just see it in you, I see it in me but it has kind of always been
[time=2280] this way, that of all the areas of failure that we as individuals experience in our lives,
[time=2289] we fight to keep our parenting failures as private as possible.
[time=2294] There is something about our shortcomings, there is something about our mistakes on that
[time=2303] front, there is something about it, it is almost the only thing that kind of rivals it is money, when we can be accountable for a hundred things, I can invite you into my life on a multitude of levels but don't talk to me about what goes on behind closed doors
[time=2318] with my kids and some of us are maybe better at that than others but I am just telling you today that it is a pattern in your life in mind that I think God wants to address.
[time=2330] Truth is if we are going to as priests pass along the attributes of God to our kids in
[time=2337] today's world, in today's culture with all that they are facing and all that we are facing,
[time=2343] we are going to need a lot of help.
[time=2349] We are so, my wife and I, we are so still in the fray on this thing, there is so much
[time=2357] good going on in our life, there are challenges that we are facing, we know we have a long ways to go with the age of our kids, I will tell you this, we wouldn't be close to where
[time=2368] we are today if it weren't for the unbelievable, if I told you, unbelievable level, an amount
[time=2375] of help that we received.
[time=2380] Wisdom from people who loved us enough to sit down and say, because everybody is going to tell you, good job, everybody say, great job with your kids, say good job with this, good job with that.
[time=2391] It is someone who loves you who sits down with you and says, hey, not a good job.
[time=2397] You need some help on this or on that, let's talk about it.
[time=2403] Moms are you going to be open to the, what did Proverbs call it?
[time=2407] Look at Proverbs 27, 6, I think it will be on the screen.
[time=2410] Moms are you open, ask yourself today, are you open to receiving wounds from a faithful
[time=2417] friend?
[time=2420] You may sit here and say, I don't have any faithful friends, you know, we should do something about that and we should help you find some of those and we could do that.
[time=2428] If you want help with that, let us know.
[time=2432] But you and I need the kinds of friends who are willing to faithfully wound us, risk the
[time=2438] comfort of the relationship, risk, oh gosh, what will they think of me?
[time=2444] Risk it all to be willing to love someone enough to sit down and say, hey, let's work on this.
[time=2449] I really think you could use some encouragement.
[time=2451] What do you say?
[time=2452] We roll our sleeves up together.
[time=2454] Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but deceitful are the kisses of an enemy.
[time=2462] Moms are you willing today, are you open to kind of an open door accountability, full
[time=2468] blown complete access to the good, the bad and the what, all of it received with humility.
[time=2476] All of it received with humility.
[time=2480] Now again, remember, this has to be asked for those of you who now are thinking about
[time=2487] the parents who you see doing things that you don't think are right, this isn't a green light for you to go and inform them.
[time=2496] We're talking about you and me and we're talking to moms in particular, are you willing to
[time=2503] say to another woman who you respect or couple who you respect, hey, would you come into
[time=2510] my life and would you talk with me about things that are concerning or talk with me about things
[time=2516] that you feel like I need to work on.
[time=2519] Moms, give it some thought, intrusive levels of accountability.
[time=2523] Well, how in the world, ladies, are you going to be able to offer all that to your kids?
[time=2531] How in the world are you going to be able to do all that we just said?
[time=2534] How is it that you are able to have as grace?
[time=2538] How is it that you're able to be physically who you need to be?
[time=2541] How is it, ladies, that you're going to pursue wisdom and courage?
[time=2545] How is it that you're going to involve yourself in very helpful and healthy and personal levels of accountability?
[time=2552] Well, I'll tell you this right now, it's not going to be because you try harder.
[time=2556] It's not going to be because you leave today and go home and make some goal sheet and try
[time=2562] to figure out how to discipline yourself, buy yourself on your own to somehow in your
[time=2568] own world accomplish these things.
[time=2571] You know, the way all of this that we've talked about this morning comes to fruition, moms, is when you grow an experience, increasing levels of intimacy with your God.
[time=2583] Moms, the degree to which you prioritize your relationship with Him, listen, the degree to
[time=2591] which you as a mother prioritize your relationship with Him, how are you growing that relationship?
[time=2600] How are you investing in that realm?
[time=2602] I know you invest in other things.
[time=2605] I know you prioritize as a mom and as a woman, a number of different arenas in your life.
[time=2611] I'm asking you this morning because so much is at stake, how are you prioritizing your relationship with Him because the degree to which you pursue Him, the degree to which you grow in your relationship with Him, the degree to which you allow Him to shape you
[time=2627] and mold you, is the degree to which you will have something spiritually healthy and vibrant
[time=2634] to pass along to your kids.
[time=2638] It's no different than marriage.
[time=2641] Your marriage will fail if the two of you aren't individually deepening and experiencing
[time=2648] greater levels of intimacy with Him, make sense, it's the very same way.
[time=2660] The early altar call, where's the door?
[time=2664] We got to get the door back out here and get her in.
[time=2668] Yeah, it's just like marriage.
[time=2671] The degree to which it goes well, individually with God is the degree to which it goes well
[time=2677] as a couple.
[time=2678] The degree to which it goes well with you, Mom, in your relationship with Him is the degree to which you're parenting and your love for them has strength, has substance, has an enduringness to it.
[time=2691] And so we want to pray for you this morning.
[time=2693] I want to pray for you on these fronts.
[time=2695] Really, the whole desire today was just to get you thinking about these things, encourage you with the fact that all that we've said is possible.
[time=2702] All of it fits within God's design for you as a mom.
[time=2707] And so what I want to do this morning before the team comes back and leads us in worship, in fact, I'll ask them to come on up now.
[time=2714] And I'm going to just ask all the moms in the room to please stand if you would.
[time=2719] Just quietly, right where you are, would all the moms in the room please stand?
[time=2724] And I know the cameras are rolling, don't let that bother you.
[time=2728] I'm so thankful sometimes that our viewing audience gets to see what actually goes on
[time=2734] in this family as we come together and this morning I want the whole world to see how much we think of you as moms.
[time=2741] And I want to just pray for you if I can.
[time=2744] As I look around the room and as I see all of you, I know that there are some of you who are at the beginning of this journey.
[time=2750] Others of you have been at it for years and years and years.
[time=2754] Some of you are grandmothers, some of you are great-grandmothers, but you're moms and you have at the very core of you this thing that God has given you, you want to love and care for those that He has put under your care and we want to do all that we can today to encourage you.
[time=2768] I'm going to ask all you moms to just bow your heads if you would.
[time=2772] And I want to ask, listen, I'm going to ask is the moms bow their heads if there are,
[time=2778] if there are sons or daughters around, if there's a husband around, if there's a good
[time=2784] friend around, then I want to just ask if you could to just maybe stand next to that mom and just put your hand on her shoulder.
[time=2795] Just put your hand right there on her shoulder.
[time=2797] I know that as a son or a daughter, young or old, I know that as a husband or a good
[time=2803] friend, I know that there's a great sense of thankfulness for what she does and who
[time=2810] she is.
[time=2811] And so as we pray this morning for her, I'll just invite you to have your hands on her
[time=2817] shoulders, your arm around her, and we will together lift her up.
[time=2822] Oh, Father in Heaven, what a joy to see so many moms in the room, so many of them who
[time=2830] want so badly, I know, to honor you, God, to be faithful to you and to be faithful to
[time=2838] the call that you have placed on their lives, to be moms among many things.
[time=2845] But God today, we get the privilege of thinking about and talking about and teaching on what it means for them to pass you along to their kids, young and old, and so we stop today and
[time=2855] we pray, God, that you would infuse them with your strength.
[time=2859] Oh, God, that you would pass along your grace to them.
[time=2864] God, we pray that you would stop at nothing to encourage them, to take care of themselves,
[time=2871] to see what a great privilege they have in the months and years to come, to be in relationship
[time=2878] with those that they love and care for.
[time=2880] And God, I pray you'd give them all the endurance and perseverance and dedication you can give
[time=2886] them to take care of themselves so that their careers with those they love are prolonged.
[time=2896] If that be your will, Father, I pray that you would give them a level of wisdom.
[time=2902] I pray, God, that you would allow these mothers who stand today to see into the situations
[time=2908] of their home and into the hearts of their kids and, oh, God, would you please grant them the courage to make hard decisions, to say hard things lovingly, to communicate whatever
[time=2922] might need to be said, God, to establish boundaries and parameters that are for the good of those
[time=2929] that they love.
[time=2931] And Father, I pray that you would, as they deepen their relationship with you, I pray
[time=2937] you'd bring others who would provide an accountability and an insight into their lives that while
[time=2943] it might be uncomfortable, while it might be embarrassing, while there may be a sense of wanting to conceal or hide it, God, I pray that instead they'd be open to those who would
[time=2956] want to talk about it so that they could grow, so that things could change, so that things could be different.
[time=2963] Oh, God, we love these mothers and we understand the great opportunity you've given them.
[time=2970] And our prayer today is that you would hold them up, that they would feel and sense your strength even now, that they would sense your touch, preparing them, not only for today
[time=2982] and tomorrow, but for the weeks and months to come.
[time=2984] Oh, God, would you raise up a priesthood of mothers who pass along to kids all the great
[time=2990] and glorious attributes of our Heavenly Father.
[time=2995] Father, thank you for the chance to consider these things this morning, allow these things
[time=3002] to stay with us as we go be with these mothers today in your son's precious name.
[time=3008] We pray and everybody agreed and said, "Hey, man, what a great song to sing on the heels of the great truth that we've just heard sing it, please, with all your hearts." The nice thing, thank you for loving me Thank you for loving me Thank you for loving me
[time=3044] Thank you for loving me Thank you for loving me Thank you for finding me Thank you for
[time=3064] finding me Thank you for finding me Thank you for finding me

[time=3108] Thank you for healing me Thank you for healing me Thank you for healing me
[time=3132] Thank you for loving me Thank you for loving me
[time=3162] Thank you for loving me Thank you for loving me Thank you for loving me
[time=3238] Thank you for saving me Thank you for saving me
[time=3268] Thank you for saving me Thank you for saving me Thank you for saving me Thank you
[time=3292] to the darkness you shine Out of the ashes we rise, there's no one
[time=3304] lying None like you I got as greater, I got stronger, got you a higher than any other
[time=3322] I got a ceiling, I sold in power, I got, I got
