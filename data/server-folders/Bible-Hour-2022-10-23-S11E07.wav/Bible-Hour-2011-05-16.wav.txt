[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] It's great to have all of you with us.
[time=36] Thank you so much for tuning in.
[time=38] I don't always sit here with you in a t-shirt, but anytime you see me in a t-shirt, it usually means one thing.
[time=46] And that is that in a few minutes, I'll go into our worship center and I'll be up in the baptistry and we'll be baptizing people this morning.
[time=56] And I got my shorts on and my t-shirt and I didn't want to change this morning because I just wanted to tell you what an important thing this is.
[time=66] What an amazing thing this is.
[time=69] How absolutely foundational this is.
[time=73] This t-shirt represents the fact that this morning I'm going to be in the water with some people who are coming to share with our family how God has transformed and changed their lives.
[time=86] That's right.
[time=87] And it's a great reminder to me that it's what we're all about.
[time=91] It's really at the very foundation of what we do.
[time=95] You might think that what we're about is teaching because you see me teach on Sundays.
[time=99] You might think we're about great programs that help people.
[time=103] You might think we're about spectacular Christmas programs.
[time=109] I don't know what you think we're about but I'll tell you what.
[time=112] While I'm thankful for our Christmas programs and I love the regular activities we get to be a part of that do help people and while I'm so grateful to get to teach God's word we are fundamentally about seeing God change and transform and redeem people.
[time=133] And I want to just say this to you.
[time=135] If you haven't been transformed, if you haven't been changed,
[time=141] if you live today with the realization down deep in your heart that you know life isn't as it should be.
[time=150] And you know you're not as you should be.
[time=153] If you realize and you know in your heart that there are things about you that really need to change I want to just invite you again to come and let us share with you and let us introduce you to the one who can transform and change you.
[time=168] It's not you, it's not me.
[time=169] It is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who has an unbelievable plan for your life.
[time=176] And so this morning I get to wear my t-shirt, get in the water and be with these dear brothers and sisters who come having been transformed and I can't think of anything better.
[time=186] So I'm looking forward to the morning.
[time=188] I can't wait to be a part of it and I can't wait to hopefully see you in the days to come.
[time=194] Come to a place where maybe you'll come and visit, come and meet us, come and give us the chance and the privilege of getting to know you.
[time=202] We're so thankful that you tune in.
[time=204] So glad that we get to spend this time with you each and every week.
[time=208] God bless you.
[time=209] I hope as you watch today, I hope you're encouraged.
[time=212] I hope as you watch today that your heart is open to what God will have for you.
[time=217] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=219] God bless you.
[time=220] Have a great week.
[time=221] I want to introduce you this morning to Gina.
[time=224] Gina Grant is a woman who I have seen God do great things in.
[time=230] I've watched as she has journeyed down this road.
[time=234] And I believe it was Easter Resurrection Sunday when some things really came clear.
[time=242] And I want Gina to just read the story that we believe God has led her to right.
[time=247] And I assured her that none of you are expecting eloquence or emotional
[time=253] composure from her that you will be encouraged and thrilled just to hear
[time=259] what God's put on her heart.
[time=261] So Gina, come and share with the folks what you've got there.
[time=263] It's good to have you here.
[time=264] Thanks.
[time=265] Yep.
[time=266] Wow, what an amazing day I had this past Easter Sunday to be exact until I had walked through that door.
[time=272] I thought I could do everything I needed on my own.
[time=275] I had everything I needed.
[time=276] A wonderful husband.
[time=277] Two great children.
[time=279] A great job.
[time=280] Nice cars.
[time=281] What would most call the perfect life?
[time=283] Really not so perfect.
[time=285] I was born and raised in northwest Indiana and was the youngest of three children.
[time=289] Until we started attending Black Hawk, I could count on one hand how many times I had been to church and not one included a weekly service.
[time=296] In 1999, I married the most amazing man in the world.
[time=299] Rob is a very loving, understanding and honest man, but most of all a true believer in Christ.
[time=305] After many fertility attempts and one miscarriage, our first daughter Emily was born and highly 21 months later.
[time=312] We also have two older children, Noelle and Felicia.
[time=315] When Emily started preschool at Black Hawk and was learning Bible verses, I figured I had better start learning myself.
[time=320] So we decided to give Black Hawk a try.
[time=323] We didn't make it a point to attend every Sunday.
[time=325] I had convinced myself that I didn't want to admit to all my sins I had committed, nor did I want anyone to know what is wrong with me.
[time=333] No one is perfect.
[time=334] There was what I called the little guy on my shoulder telling me I didn't need church and then I could do everything on my own and I believed it.
[time=342] Before leaving for good Friday service, my daughter Emily asked me why I hadn't accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior and let him into my heart.
[time=349] For the first time ever, I was speechless.
[time=352] She had surrendered her heart to him on January to 17th.
[time=356] When we returned home, I had this awful feeling.
[time=358] My heart just ached.
[time=359] I had this empty feeling and all Rob said to me was, Noelle, Felicia, Emily and Holly and I are going to be in heaven.
[time=366] Where are you going to be?
[time=368] So during Easter Sunday service, when the door to heaven was placed in front of the stage, and Pastor Kelly asked what heaven would be like sitting on a cloud, strumming a harp.
[time=376] No, it would be perfect and we wouldn't be alone.
[time=379] Today was it.
[time=380] I couldn't get to that door fast enough.
[time=382] I need him and I want him in my life.
[time=384] I don't want to be alone.
[time=386] That door seemed so far away and I apologize to the four people sitting next to me because I'm sure I stepped on them trying to get out.
[time=393] A verse that just seems to keep every time I open my Bible, Romans 6-20.
[time=399] When I was a slave to sin, I was free from control of righteousness.
[time=402] What benefit did I reap at the time from the things I am now ashamed of?
[time=406] Those things result in death, but now that I have been set free from sin and became a slave to God, the benefit I reap leads to holiness and the result is eternal life.
[time=415] I want to be baptized today in celebration of my eternal life.
[time=420] [APPLAUSE]
[time=425] That's awesome.
[time=427] Well, I believe you do.
[time=429] I hope you mean it when you clap because it is something worth celebrating.
[time=434] And it is a great thing to see.
[time=436] I got at work in the life of an individual and to understand and then see the ripple of that in a family to see, you know, people will ask me sometimes,
[time=448] you know, why do we do a preschool?
[time=453] There you go.
[time=455] That's one of the reasons we do a preschool right there because we so enjoy investing in little ones and we so treasure the opportunity that that brings
[time=465] to invest in and come alongside and encourage their parents.
[time=469] I'm so grateful for you as a family, the way that you've received, Gina.
[time=473] I will attest to what she said about Easter.
[time=475] I truly think she was the first one down the aisle.
[time=479] The first face I saw coming toward that door and this morning we just want to celebrate the fact that she has fully and completely surrendered her heart and life to Jesus Christ.
[time=489] She has devoted herself to following the Lord and I am so grateful for you.
[time=496] Gina, let me turn you around this way as your pastor and your friend.
[time=502] It is an honor and a real privilege today to baptize you, the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=509] We love you.
[time=510] We're thankful for your place in this family and we are so grateful that he has saved and redeemed and transformed you.
[time=518] What a joy to get to do this today.
[time=522] [APPLAUSE]
[time=532] I'm going to ask Jonathan to come on down.
[time=534] Jonathan Burke and his dad, Lonnie's with him and I just want you to be so encouraged.
[time=540] Listen.
[time=541] I read it two or three times this morning.
[time=543] Listen just carefully to the way Jonathan kind of wrote his story.
[time=548] It's not long, you know, it's not eloquent but I tell you what, it comes from his heart.
[time=554] When you listen to the words that he chose as he writes this thing out, I think he'll just be really, really encouraged.
[time=561] Hi Jonathan.
[time=562] Hi.
[time=563] How are you, buddy?
[time=564] Good.
[time=565] Well, we're glad you're here, man.
[time=567] I'm so thankful for your dad and mom and your family and thankful for what has gone on in your heart.
[time=572] Lately, why don't you just read what you got there for everybody and let us be encouraged.
[time=576] My name is Jonathan Burke.
[time=578] I am 11 years old and I'm from Marsboro, Republic of the Marshall Islands.
[time=582] I was adopted by Lonnie and Laura Burke.
[time=585] My dad and mom.
[time=586] I have three sisters.
[time=587] Alexis Jones here in denial.
[time=589] I have a new baby brother named Jayden.
[time=592] I go to Haley Elementary School and I am in the fourth grade.
[time=597] I believe that God is in my heart and he is my way to heaven.
[time=600] None Jesus is the way to heaven.
[time=603] I am a sinner and I do not always do the right things.
[time=607] I'm not perfect.
[time=608] So I ask Jesus for forgiveness of my sins and ask him to live in my heart.
[time=613] Now, when I'm about to do something wrong, I check with my brain and heart.
[time=618] I try to listen to my heart more.
[time=621] The way I'm going to heaven is by believing in Jesus.
[time=625] Jesus died for me on the cross for my sins.
[time=629] I have friends at school and my quills, Spencer, Jason and Saul.
[time=634] We talk a lot about Jesus because my friends and I love Jesus.
[time=639] We tell others at school about Jesus.
[time=642] I love coming to church in Sunday school to learn about God and Jesus.
[time=648] I want to thank Janice Mauricey for the faith basics class where I learned more about Jesus
[time=656] and his death on the cross.
[time=658] Because of my friends and my dad and my mom, I decided to be baptized before you.
[time=663] Thank you.
[time=670] That's cool.
[time=673] I want to just...good job, buddy.
[time=676] I want to just read this one line to you again.
[time=678] It's good for every one of us to just let it sink in and be reminded of the great truth.
[time=687] John then wrote, "I am a sinner and I do not always do the right things.
[time=695] I'm not perfect." So I asked Jesus for forgiveness of my sins and asked him to live in my heart.
[time=708] Amen?
[time=709] And I love this.
[time=711] Now I'm about to do something wrong.
[time=713] I check with my brain and heart.
[time=716] And I try to listen to my heart more.
[time=720] Oh, Jonathan, thank you, bud.
[time=722] Thanks for being here today.
[time=724] Burks, thank you for all that you guys give to your kids and to this little guy.
[time=729] And I'm going to baptize you now, buddy.
[time=731] If you would hold on to my hand there.
[time=734] And it's a real honor for all of us to have heard you proclaim your love for the Lord, Jonathan.
[time=740] And we believe that you do love him.
[time=742] And we believe he is in your heart.
[time=744] It's an honor, as your pastor and friend today, to baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=750] (Applause) Amen, boy.
[time=753] Thank you, Jonathan.
[time=755] Well, thank you, brother.
[time=757] (Applause)
[time=765] Oh, I want you to meet Ryan.
[time=769] Ryan Davis, I've had the privilege of reading Ryan's story as well.
[time=773] Come on in, Ryan.
[time=775] And have been just encouraged, as we've on the team here, we've several of us have had the privilege
[time=781] of getting to interact with Ryan.
[time=784] And I know that you're going to be encouraged as you hear how God has brought him to this place.
[time=789] Hey, bud.
[time=790] Good to see you.
[time=791] Welcome.
[time=792] Thank you.
[time=793] Come on in here and just read your story and tell the folks what you got down there.
[time=795] First thing you should be thankful of, Laurie, maybe doing it on one page so it's going to be the reader's digest version.
[time=800] My name is Ryan Davis.
[time=802] I'm married to my best friend, Sarah.
[time=804] And we have three wonderful children, Simon Age 7, Marnie Age 3, and a little Jack who just turned two this past Easter Sunday.
[time=813] To plagiarize from my brother, who I lost to cancer almost two years ago, if you know my wife and kids, enough said,
[time=819] if not, make the effort because it's well worth it.
[time=822] I'm currently employed as a general manager of a lawn maintenance company.
[time=826] I have been with that company for almost five years.
[time=829] This follows quite a lengthy stint in the United States Army where I served as an infantryman.
[time=833] I'm an outdoorsman at heart and will camp fish and hunt when given the chance.
[time=837] All right.
[time=838] How I arrived here, although my parents divorced before I even had the memory of them being married, between the two of them and my stepmother,
[time=845] they managed to bring me to the First United Methodist Church in Miss Milwaukee, often enough to be baptized and confirmed.
[time=852] However, after confirmation, at the age of 14, church was no longer a part of my life.
[time=857] As a consequence, I have always had faith and a belief in God in our Savior Jesus Christ,
[time=863] but my walk through life always paralleled his.
[time=866] I kept him in sight, but I never really walked with him.
[time=869] That changed in 2001 and 2002.
[time=872] Beyond the evils of 9/11 and the all-too-available video of the beheading of Daniel Pearl that flew in all of our faces,
[time=879] during that time frame on a personal level, I held my mother's hand as she took her last breath on a Christmas night,
[time=885] and I ended a tumultuous divorce marriage.
[time=889] I was very tumultuous and childless after 10 years.
[time=894] I was weak and vulnerable and made a nearly life-ruining mistake.
[time=898] I had the opportunity to either veer my path closer to him or veer away and lose sight of him, and I chose a ladder.
[time=905] I fast-forwarded three years.
[time=907] I found myself alone in a small downtown apartment.
[time=911] I had a bankruptcy, another marriage, and another divorce under my belt.
[time=915] I was at my rock bottom, living paycheck to paycheck, making no moves to correct the course.
[time=921] It was at this time God brought me my wife, Sarah.
[time=924] Sarah comes from a strong Christian family, and she had surrendered her heart to Jesus Christ years before I met her.
[time=930] Her conversion of me was not overt or forceful.
[time=934] It was a gradual awakening through her example of faith and prayer.
[time=938] After a few years of her example and the births of our children, my path began to veer back, and I can now see him again.
[time=946] This time I'm not going to hesitate.
[time=948] I am bee-lining towards him.
[time=950] When Kelly asked me to last Easter's son's service while I was walking through the Easter door, I did not hesitate, nor was the answer contrived.
[time=958] It came out before I even contemplated it.
[time=960] I want to surrender my heart to Jesus Christ.
[time=964] What's different now?
[time=967] Since finding my way back to Christ, there have been a couple of major changes in my life.
[time=972] First, I have already begun to wholeheartedly pursue a career in teaching at the high school level in general and teaching in a Christian environment, ultimately.
[time=980] Although my current job is steady, safe, and offers decent financial order, I know in my heart that teaching is the work he wants me to do.
[time=987] I am so sure that I am flying through the curriculum this far.
[time=990] My advisor is amazed at the speed I am accomplishing this.
[time=993] In conjunction with that, I have been regularly attending services here at Black Hawk and have attended.
[time=999] And if Chris, if you're out there, I will be back to the Mosaic ABF.
[time=1003] Also, I have been attending Jesse Hannah's 212 group on Wednesday nights and have submitted my packet to be an adult leader with student ministries.
[time=1011] Finally, I'm pursuing membership here at Black Hawk and have my pre-membership meeting with the elders on May 22nd.
[time=1017] Finally, why I want to be baptized, and this one was easy.
[time=1021] I need a rebirth.
[time=1023] I need my past transgressions and sins washed away, and I need to emerge doing his work again for the first time in my life.
[time=1030] I want Andy to walk with him. Amen.
[time=1043] Hey, just a reminder, as you listen to that story, and you can put different trappings around it.
[time=1051] You can paint it differently, but the truth is, from a dark apartment downtown with absolutely nothing.
[time=1062] No hope, no future, nothing but the sin and shame and guilt of a past haunting you every day.
[time=1072] To this.
[time=1074] [AMEN] To this.
[time=1076] That is, that is transformation.
[time=1080] That is the great story, and that is the great truth of what the spirit of God and the person of God through the work of the Son of God does.
[time=1089] Amen?
[time=1090] And whether it's an eight-year-old, or what are you?
[time=1092] Forty-six.
[time=1093] Forty-six-year-old, or fifty-six-year-old, whoever you are, wherever you've been, wherever you've found yourself,
[time=1101] the Lord Jesus Christ is about restoring and renewing and redeeming.
[time=1107] And here today we have a great example of that very thing.
[time=1111] So, my friend, let me give you my hand there.
[time=1115] Ryan, thank you for sharing with us your story.
[time=1118] It was so encouraging to see you walk through that door on Resurrection Sunday, and I remember you saying those words.
[time=1126] And I'm so thankful that today you know that the surrender of your heart and life to him,
[time=1133] your belief in him as your Lord and Savior has saved you.
[time=1139] [AMEN] And you get to stand here today in these waters and be obedient because he said to be baptized.
[time=1145] And in the process, proclaim to this your new family, your love for him.
[time=1149] And as your pastor and friend, it's an honor to baptize you today in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1155] [APPLAUSE - 3 seconds]
[time=1164] You have overcome the grave, your glory fills the highest place.
[time=1171] What can separate me now?
[time=1176] You have overcome the grave, your glory fills the highest place.
[time=1185] What can separate me now?
[time=1190] You have overcome the grave, your glory fills the highest place.
[time=1199] What can separate me now?
[time=1203] You told me you made a way when you said that it is done.
[time=1860] You know, I don't think I would get an argument from anybody in the room, nobody.
[time=1865] If I just begin to talk to you about the reality that no team, no team, you've all been on teams.
[time=1872] I've been on teams.
[time=1874] We've watched teams.
[time=1875] We've played on teams.
[time=1876] We have favorite teams.
[time=1877] No team will succeed or really be any better than its coach.
[time=1883] No company.
[time=1884] No organization.
[time=1885] No business will grow without healthy management and oversight.
[time=1890] No family will ever experience maximum potential moms and dads.
[time=1896] No family will ever experience all that God designed for your family to experience spiritually,
[time=1904] emotionally, relationally.
[time=1907] Your family will never experience maximum potential unless mom and dad reach theirs.
[time=1914] And today in 1 Timothy 4 verses 6 to 16, Paul says in no uncertain terms that churches will
[time=1921] always be in need of leaders who engage in healthy, right, godly, leading and living.
[time=1929] If a church is to flourish, if a church is to be all that God intended it to be,
[time=1935] God says clearly right here through the pen of Paul to the young pastor Timothy, then you've got to get it right.
[time=1942] He says, as a leader, there are things that you have got to get right.
[time=1949] And I want to encourage you this morning, it was several weeks ago, a couple months ago we came to 1 Timothy 3 and the qualifications of an elder.
[time=1958] And I told you that day, I said, "Hey, if you're not like in the bull's-eye target range
[time=1964] of this message, if you're not an elder here today." I said, "Don't go to sleep.
[time=1968] Don't take a pass on this.
[time=1970] Listen, because I believe there are things that can apply to you.
[time=1975] Listen, because I believe there are things that God has for you." And while this passage is clearly Paul addressing Timothy, the leader of the church,
[time=1986] all my friends as we make our way through this, you will be, I hope, encouraged.
[time=1990] And I think really challenged to grow in your faith, to grow in your walk, to grow in you and the contribution you make to this thing being all that God intended it to be.
[time=2002] So I hope you'll follow along.
[time=2005] There are some things that as you read through this passage that have to be embraced.
[time=2011] If Timothy is going to be the leader that God called him to be.
[time=2014] So let's just look at him, shall we?
[time=2015] And let's see what God has for us this morning.
[time=2018] Number one, you see it right there in verse six.
[time=2021] If Timothy is going to lead well, if the church is going to flourish, it's because those in leadership in the church stay close to the truth.
[time=2029] I hope you'll write that down.
[time=2031] Those in leadership will always stay close to the truth.
[time=2035] And again, here the context is the church.
[time=2038] I would encourage you moms and dads to give thought to this.
[time=2041] I would encourage you leaders at work to give thought to this.
[time=2047] But the immediate context is those who lead in the church must stay close to the truth.
[time=2054] It says in pointing out these things to the brethren.
[time=2058] You see that in verse six.
[time=2060] In pointing out these things to the brethren.
[time=2062] Now stop right there, just real quick, I promise.
[time=2064] In pointing out these things.
[time=2066] What he's talking about, listen, what he's talking about is all that he has pointed out so far.
[time=2072] Everything that Paul has directed Timothy toward, all the great truth that has been revealed.
[time=2078] All the things that Paul has said already that Timothy needs to pass along to those in his flock and his family.
[time=2086] All the stuff that we've read to this point, what Paul says here is that in pointing out these things, the truth.
[time=2096] Not the false teaching that was beginning to infiltrate the church, and we talked about that false teaching in weeks gone by.
[time=2105] You're not the false teaching, but the truth.
[time=2108] In pointing out the truth to the church, it says there, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus.
[time=2119] And how will you do this? How can you be one who as a good servant is constantly pointing out the truth?
[time=2127] You are constantly what nourished.
[time=2130] It's when you are constantly feeding on the words of the faith and of the sound doctrine which you have been following.
[time=2139] All right, let's back up in pointing out these things.
[time=2142] One of the primary and most important opportunities and responsibilities of a pastor is to point out the truth.
[time=2148] I hope you understand this. I hope you know this. I think many of you do.
[time=2152] One of the primary opportunities of a pastor is to point out these things to his people.
[time=2158] The truth about you name it.
[time=2163] I get to stand here week after week. I get to be a part of your lives and even in other settings.
[time=2170] We get to sit in restaurant booths. We sit in my office.
[time=2173] You sit with others who are on our team. We have elders who do the very same thing.
[time=2178] We do our best to point out these things. What are these things?
[time=2182] The truth about marriage, the truth about parenting, the truth about conflict, the truth about humility, the truth about money, the truth about worry, the truth about anxiety, sexual purity, truthfulness, forgiveness, pride, your thoughts.
[time=2201] Sin, wisdom, eternity. The list goes on.
[time=2207] We have the privilege of getting to point out these things to you as we do our very best to teach and shepherd you.
[time=2217] And God's Word says right here in verse 6 that the only way for me or you in your world of leadership to be able to point these things out is to be extremely familiar
[time=2230] with them, to be close to them.
[time=2234] Because I'm, what does the text say? Because I'm being constantly nourished on them.
[time=2240] Because I'm constantly being fed myself, I'm able to point these things out to you, you who like me desperately need to hear them.
[time=2252] Constantly nourish, the word nourished there means literally to feed on. And if it helps you to paint a middle picture, go ahead and paint it.
[time=2259] It literally means you and I who lead being those who eat the Word of God, who take it in and chew on it and swallow it and digest it.
[time=2273] I mean, that's the picture, the intimate proximity, those who stay close to the truth.
[time=2281] The only way I can pass along and point out truth is to feed on it, to read it, to study it, to meditate on it, to memorize and hold close the scriptures.
[time=2290] Me as a pastor, with my congregation, you as a parent at home with yours, and I certainly hope you view it that way.
[time=2300] I really do. I hope that you view your family as your congregation.
[time=2306] I hope you understand the great opportunity and responsibility God has given you to lead and to love and to shepherd them.
[time=2314] When we allow ourselves to be consumed with a steady diet of the truth, when the truth is something that we stay in proximity with, we're able to point out the things that matter most.
[time=2328] So grateful, who's reminded again just recently, God's Word says everything we need pertaining to life and godliness is here.
[time=2337] Everything we need pertaining to life and godliness is here for us.
[time=2345] I've been trying in my own life, there have been seasons in my life where this has gone well, there have been seasons in my life where it hasn't.
[time=2354] But I tell you lately in my life, I'd say over the last several months, I've been trying to read portions of the Bible more often and more frequently.
[time=2366] And I want to say it to you that way, and you may not identify with this, but I just got to say it to you this way.
[time=2372] There was a time in my life where I sort of reacted adversely when I would hear older guys stand up and talk about the importance of Bible reading.
[time=2382] And I think I reacted adversely because I was arrogant and I was young and I was foolish and I didn't want to be about Bible reading, I wanted to be about Bible study.
[time=2396] I wanted to be about the deep, serious, expositional, exegetical treatment of the passage and I wanted to be one who went deep and I wanted to understand the greater context and I wanted to understand the greater meaning and I wanted to be a student of the word, I didn't want to be a reader.
[time=2418] And none of you may identify with that, but I'll tell you what, that was me.
[time=2423] And the older I've gotten, the little bit of wisdom I feel like I'm gaining as the years go by.
[time=2430] I can't tell you how sweet and how precious and how rich and how fruitful times of reading the Bible are.
[time=2440] I still think that we should study it. I still think that we should exeget it. I still think that you and I should be involved in some form of kind of systematic study, be it a study group, a Bible study, however that works for you.
[time=2453] But what I'm trying to do more and more of in my life these days and what I would encourage you to do more and more of in your life these days in the morning, at noon, at night, on your break, in between classes, before a meal.
[time=2476] Any chance you get, I would encourage you to open up the scriptures and read them and pray to God as you do it for five minutes or ten minutes or twenty minutes.
[time=2488] Pray to God that He'll use those life-giving words to encourage you, to remind you, to spark a question that you'll write down and share with one who you trust can give you insight.
[time=2498] But moms, students, young students, older students, dads, owners, managers, boss, I don't care who you are.
[time=2509] I hope that you, I hope you carry a copy of the scriptures with you, your book bag.
[time=2515] I hope you've got one in your car. Maybe you carry one in your purse.
[time=2520] I've always been a little, I've always been a little hesitant, you know, it might shock some of you cause I think some of you feel like I'm just a risk taker out of the gate, but I've always been a little hesitant with the technology thing.
[time=2533] I've never been hesitant with technology as it relates to other things, but I was always a little hesitant when it came to the Bible.
[time=2542] But I just, I've got to tell you, I've got a phone a while ago that's got a Bible app and I still have a Bible in my office and I've still got a Bible in my room and I've got a Bible in the community.
[time=2556] I'm still very, very connected to this right here. I think I always will be.
[time=2562] But I'll tell you what, I've got this app on my phone.
[time=2565] And here's why I bring this up because I haven't said a lot about this. I may have mentioned it to some people close to me and I'm addicted to sports.
[time=2579] And there are times when I'm too interested in sports and not interested enough in things that matter, so I've been trying to grow in that.
[time=2588] I don't think there's anything wrong with sports. I don't think there's anything evil about sports. I don't think there's anything evil about shopping. I don't think there's anything evil about eating. I don't think there's anything evil about doing scrapbooks.
[time=2599] I don't, you're with me, but we can take those things places that are just downright unhealthy.
[time=2607] So anyway, on my phone, I just, I got one of those iPhones and you can take, you can really cool.
[time=2615] You can take the app, right, and you can kind of move it wherever you want it on your phone, on your screen.
[time=2620] And so what I did was I got my Bible app and I put it right next to ESPN.
[time=2629] ESPN.com app. Does that make sense? And so I'm trying, I really am. I'm trying every day.
[time=2636] I'm telling you, I look at that app, that ESPN app. I look at it all the time.
[time=2640] And I'm just trying every day to not hit that one until I hit that one.
[time=2644] And every time I hit the right one, right, you know what I mean?
[time=2648] I'm just reminded of how healthy that is, how good that is. Five minutes, ten minutes. Read the scriptures.
[time=2657] Let that stuff sink in, morning, noon, and night. Good leaders stay close to the truth.
[time=2667] Secondly, good leaders stay away from speculation. Look what it says there in the text of my friends. Look at verse 7.
[time=2674] It says, "But have nothing to do, nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women,
[time=2681] but have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women."
[time=2688] Kind of a brief point here, but let me just make it. Here's what he's saying on this one.
[time=2692] What he's saying is this, you go back to page one on my notes, and let me say it to you this way.
[time=2698] Anybody in the room, you don't have to raise your hand, but I know you would.
[time=2701] Anybody in the room at all here need help today. Anybody in the room here needs some direction.
[time=2706] Does anybody in the room here need guidance on any of the following, marriage, parenting, conflict, money, worry, humility, anxiety, sexual purity, truthfulness,
[time=2719] forgiveness, pride, thought, life, sin, wisdom, eternity?
[time=2726] If anybody in the room needs any help at all on any of that,
[time=2733] what you need for that, whatever that is, is the truth.
[time=2739] You need the truth. You need the truth about those things.
[time=2745] You don't need Dr. Phil. Does this make sense? I don't know Phil. He seems like a good man.
[time=2753] I'm just making a point. You don't need a magazine article written by whoever.
[time=2759] You don't need the popular opinion of the group you hang with, though they're good people, and many of them might have wisdom.
[time=2768] I'm talking about what you ultimately need, and you don't need popular opinion.
[time=2774] You don't need anything other than everything pertaining to what?
[time=2783] Life and godliness. You need the truth.
[time=2790] Here Paul tells Timothy, "Stay away from everyone's best crack at it,
[time=2796] because everyone's always going to be willing to give you their best crack at it.
[time=2800] Stay away from speculation. Stay away from human guessing.
[time=2804] Hang on tightly to the truth." I really do. It breaks my heart in some ways. It makes me smile and others.
[time=2813] It's usually an interesting conversation when someone says to me, and they have for years and years and years.
[time=2818] People have said to me about this point in this conversation.
[time=2821] They said, "Yeah, but the Bible doesn't speak to everything."
[time=2831] I appreciate your sentiment there, Kelly, but there's things in my life I face and I encounter. The Bible just doesn't speak to everything.
[time=2840] Maybe when I was younger, I did this flippantly and arrogantly.
[time=2844] I hope I've grown over the years. Today, it doesn't feel arrogant.
[time=2850] It feels genuine when I just say to them, "Name it.
[time=2857] Just tell me one. Go ahead. Let's talk about it.
[time=2860] Name one thing you're facing. Name one question you have.
[time=2864] Name one thing that you're wrestling with." Let's see if God's Word doesn't speak to it directly or in principle, in truth.
[time=2875] I'm so thankful that I could sit with any one of you in anything that you're facing.
[time=2882] Our elders could sit with any one of you. Our staff could sit with any one of you.
[time=2886] Our small group leaders could sit with our A.B.F. leaders, could sit with any one of you.
[time=2890] And whatever it is that troubles you, whatever it is that confuses you, whatever it is you're trying to figure out, we're so thankful the Word of God speaks to that.
[time=2899] So we avoid speculation and we do our best to bring people again and again back to the truth.
[time=2906] Stay devoted to spiritual workouts. Not only are you to stay close to the truth,
[time=2912] and not only do we stay away from speculation, but number three, write this down.
[time=2917] Those who lead well will stay devoted, deeply devoted to spiritual training,
[time=2924] spiritual workouts. Look at our passage and go to the last part of verse 7.
[time=2929] It said, "Have nothing to do with worldly fables, speculation." On the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness.
[time=2938] For bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things.
[time=2947] Since it, godliness holds promise for the present life and also for the what?
[time=2956] For the life to come.
[time=2961] You know what that means, right?
[time=2966] Is it okay if I'm blunt? Can I be blunt today?
[time=2971] Can I be blunt? What that means is that that's really true.
[time=2975] You can have amazing abs.
[time=2980] Physically, you can have an incredible body.
[time=2985] And there's a lot out there, in there, to help you have an amazing body.
[time=2994] Physically, you can have amazing abs, but spiritually, you can wind up separated from God for all eternity.
[time=3005] That's really what that says.
[time=3009] For bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.
[time=3019] You've got to be careful, my friends, and those who lead have to be careful what it is we're most devoted to, what it is we're most disciplined about.
[time=3031] Nothing wrong with bodily discipline, it's of little profit, the text said.
[time=3038] But what I've got to be as I lead and what you've got to be as you lead, what we've got to be devoted to and dedicated to and just fired up about and willing to go to great lengths for is spiritual discipline.
[time=3054] What is it profit a man? Jesus said in Mark 8, what is it profit a man if he gains a great body?
[time=3060] What is it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul?
[time=3069] It's tempting, I know, it really is.
[time=3072] But be reminded that being consumed with you now,
[time=3080] being consumed with now profits you little if you lose forever.
[time=3090] Did that make sense?
[time=3092] Oh, my friends, don't lose forever.
[time=3097] Being consumed with now, nothing wrong with being connected to now,
[time=3103] nothing wrong with faithfulness in the now, being consumed with now profits you little if you lose forever.
[time=3111] What are some ways that you could be engaged in spiritual disciplines?
[time=3116] Bodily disciplines, pretty clear, spin class, a great diet, personal trainer.
[time=3122] Spin class, P90X, personal trainer.
[time=3127] Robics, running, you name it, you can make a little list there on bodily disciplines.
[time=3134] What are the spiritual disciplines that Paul tells Timothy are much more important in the end game?
[time=3144] Here's a few I just gave you, I hope you'll write these down, serving the physical needs of others, be ready, be prepared, be willing to do that, to serve the physical needs of others.
[time=3160] We can help you with that, but you know what, you can do that by simply watching and looking around your world,
[time=3167] serving on a regular basis the physical needs of others, giving generously, giving graciously.
[time=3174] These are spiritual disciplines, the regular reading and integrating of the word of God into your everyday life.
[time=3182] We talked about it, when you're willing and I'm willing to hit that app before that app, when it's morning, noon and night,
[time=3188] maybe 10, 15 minutes, when we're willing to discipline ourselves to take the truth that gives life
[time=3194] and integrate it into our lives, God promises to bless and honor those efforts, times of prayer and fasting.
[time=3203] That grow and stretch your faith, serving others in need, giving generously, reading the word of God,
[time=3210] times of prayer and fasting, dedication and devotion to gathering here on a Sunday morning with the family.
[time=3218] Regular times of confession, times where you read the scriptures with your son or your daughters,
[time=3226] times when you read the scriptures as a family, times where you make it a point to pray intentionally with your family
[time=3233] for those in your life, spiritual disciplines, bodily disciplines, nothing wrong with spin class,
[time=3243] but physically you can be ripped, you can be cut up, you can be in elite, athletic condition,
[time=3250] you can run forever, you can be a size two, but what if you're lost?
[time=3259] What if you don't have any hope? What if there's no clarity? What if there's nothing real or significant in your life?
[time=3271] You've got to stay devoted to spiritual workouts. Stay away from immaturity, we're going to end with this one.
[time=3280] Stay away from immaturity, prescribe and teach these things, Timothy, let no one look down on your youthfulness,
[time=3286] but rather in speech conduct, love, faith and purity, show yourself an example of those who believe.
[time=3294] Paul knew Timothy was younger than some, he would be leading and Paul knew Timothy was human,
[time=3301] and so Paul knew that Timothy's speech, think about it, think about mature people and immature people.
[time=3308] Think about what immature people, think about what we do sometimes, think about what happens,
[time=3314] last thing, just stay with me here, think about what happens in a setting, in a scenario, when you're with someone and something happens and you just kind of cringe and you go "Ah, that's pretty immature."
[time=3330] I bet you it has to do with speech, conduct, love, faith or purity.
[time=3338] And Paul knew that Timothy could just blow it, he could lose credibility if there wasn't something in him
[time=3347] that was really striving for in those areas, speech conduct, love, faith and purity,
[time=3353] if there wasn't something that was striving for maturity.
[time=3358] Youthfulness, you know what, youthfulness, everybody, youthfulness gets messy, doesn't it?
[time=3366] In our youthfulness, it gets a little sideways sometimes.
[time=3371] Thank God that Philippians 1, 6 is true, that he who began a good work in us promises to complete that work, amen?
[time=3380] And sometimes it takes a few months and sometimes it takes a few years, but all, those of you who lead, those of us who pastor,
[time=3389] those of you who parent, keep, I would take, here's what I would do, I challenged first hour and I'll challenge you with this.
[time=3397] I would take those words right there, speech, conduct, love, faith and purity.
[time=3401] I want you to find two verses in the Scriptures for each one of those.
[time=3407] And I'd love for you to email me this week.
[time=3409] You just email me at the church, I'll reply to your email, I'd love for you to find two verses, all of you.
[time=3416] Just write those words down, go home, here's some Bible reading for you.
[time=3420] Do it individually, do it as a family, do it as a small group, find some passages that support how important it is
[time=3428] that our speech, conduct, love, faith and purity be God honoring.
[time=3431] Get all that down, shoot me an email, I would love to see what you come up with and I would love to encourage you in that pursuit.
[time=3438] Hey, would you stand and let me pray for us this morning?
[time=3441] There'll be white buckets on your way out today, those white buckets again are for our high school kids and the adults who are going with them to Nairobi, to Kenya, to work in our orphanage over there.
[time=3452] I'm so thankful for their willingness to go and your spare change, small bills, whatever you want to drop in,
[time=3458] is going to help them on that trip.
[time=3460] Great to be together.
[time=3461] Father in heaven, we leave today thankful for the testimonies of life change that we were able to hear and experience.
[time=3468] God, thank you for the privilege of remembering the sacrifice of your Son.
[time=3473] And oh, God, thank you for this passage of Scripture that reminds us of those things that matter most,
[time=3480] especially for those who get to lead and love and care for others.
[time=3484] God help us to do that well.
[time=3486] We ask in your Son's name.
[time=3488] [AMEN]
