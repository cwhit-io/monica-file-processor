[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] [MUSIC - 147 seconds]
[time=186] - God, we thank you this morning.
[time=192] That you have breathed your salvation into our hearts and that you've caused us to come awake.
[time=199] And thanks for that gift of life today.
[time=202] In Jesus' name we pray.
[time=204] [AMEN] - Thanks for singing with us.
[time=208] You may be seated.
[time=209] - I wanted to take a few minutes here this morning
[time=220] to just extend a really big thank you to all of you on behalf of my wife and I and our kids.
[time=228] These last four Sundays that I haven't been with you, have been some of the hardest weeks of our lives.
[time=237] But your kind words through emails and cards have been really precious.
[time=245] Your gifts of food and gift certificates and books and it's just been overwhelming and knowing that you care for us has meant a lot.
[time=256] And even beyond that, knowing that you're praying for us has meant even more, I'm confident that without your prayers and without the hand of God moving in our hearts, we would have made a lot more foolish decisions that we would have had an earthly perspective instead of a heavenly one over these last few weeks.
[time=280] And we've just seen God give us strength for each and every day in some really special, some really kind ways that he's just shown himself to us.
[time=291] So thank you.
[time=292] It's meant more than you'll probably ever know.
[time=295] Perhaps some of you are visiting this morning and I don't wanna leave you out of the loop.
[time=303] My name's Corbin and I'm the worship pastor here.
[time=306] Four weeks ago, my wife who's expecting our fourth child
[time=312] and I were at the ultrasound, just kind of a routine thing.
[time=316] And we learned that day that although all of our other pregnancies have been very normal and healthy, this one's not.
[time=322] We have a little girl and her name is Zoe Hope and she does not have a brain.
[time=329] She's got a brain stem that causes her heart to be and causes her to flip around and move like normal.
[time=336] But after she's born, she probably won't live.
[time=341] So that's big news.
[time=343] And we're sort of dealing with it.
[time=346] I feel like we've mourned a lot over the last month but we also don't want to mourn too much because we have Zoe with us right now.
[time=358] The doctors have given us insight into the future but we don't wanna cry too much now because right now Zoe's alive and well and she will be every minute she's with in Tanya's body, Lord willing.
[time=374] So we're joyful that we get these moments with her but as you can imagine, it's just really hard.
[time=381] I wanted to share with you some of the ways that God has walked with us because it's been really special and meaningful to us and it gives us hope for what's ahead in July.
[time=396] We know that if God's gonna be this near to us in May, how much more near will he be in July?
[time=401] A couple of things that I wanted you to know about
[time=407] and everybody probably just says things like this.
[time=410] You know, God was preparing us for this moment or as much as a blind sight at us.
[time=415] We've just really felt like he was preparing us for that moment but not even in our first 30 years of life but specifically in the timing of when we found out the news two things that I just think are incredible.
[time=427] I was in a class for some graduate work.
[time=431] I was in a theology class and had been reading and reading and reading lots and lots of different topics and things for months but the day before we found out about Zoe's brain, God would have it that I was reading a chapter on sin
[time=449] and what we believe about sin, what the Bible has to say about sin specifically as it relates to the idea of original sin, this idea that everyone is born with a sinful nature and what do we believe about children that die before they reach an age of accountability where they can understand and receive the gospel before what happens to kids who are born with original sin but they die before they can profess with their mouth and believe in their heart that Jesus is Lord.
[time=478] And I was reading these rich pages about how it isn't just sentimental mush that we believe they go to be with Jesus but there's like scripture to back it up and that was washing my brain and my heart on Wednesday before we went to the doctor on Thursday.
[time=493] When I was tempted to believe on Thursday
[time=499] that she wasn't real or tempted to believe that she wouldn't go to heaven, I had the truth that the Holy Spirit gave me the day before to lean into.
[time=509] My wife is an incredibly intelligent woman
[time=515] who has been stifled by the children for the last five years.
[time=519] She loves to read but she hasn't read a book since we had kids.
[time=525] Some of you moms might be able to relate.
[time=527] It's all she can do to take care of them and read her Bible.
[time=530] Any other books she picks up, she's asleep in about 35 seconds.
[time=535] However, God gave Tanya a book a few weeks before the baby was born and she couldn't put it down and she read the whole thing cover to cover.
[time=546] Actually, Jamie, a friend in the choir, gave Tanya the book, Heaven is for real and some of you may have heard of that book.
[time=553] It's a sweet account about a four year old boy who claims that he spent some time with Jesus in heaven and it's just a fascinating read.
[time=562] Some of the things that this little boy knows about heaven and about the Bible are just pretty incredible stuff.
[time=569] So this book's all about his testimony and one of the components in the book was that the little boy met his older sister and he talked to mom and dad later and said, "Why don't you tell me I had an older sister?" And the parents were like, "What?
[time=582] "How did you know they had a miscarriage "before he was ever born?" And they never even told them about it.
[time=588] Tanya's reading it and just thinking, "Gosh, what a sweet gift to those moms "who have been through miscarriages "and what a sweet gift for them to know "that God loves those babies and takes care of them." She finished the book and handed it back to Jamie on Wednesday night and Thursday morning we were at the doctor finding out that our little girl wasn't gonna be with us.
[time=611] It felt like it was too amazing to be a coincidence.
[time=618] We felt like God was really caring for us in those ways.
[time=622] Another thing he did, I think Pastor Kelly told all of you that we were headed to the Czech Republic shortly after we found out about that.
[time=629] Back in January, some friends of ours who do missions work in the Czech Republic, asked if Tanya and I would join him in May to do sort of a children's program for their elementary and high school age kids where we would teach them music and dance and drama.
[time=645] It felt like it was right up our alley and something we would love to do to be a blessing to them at their family conference.
[time=653] So we had just kind of said, "Yes, we'd go to that." And had no idea that we would get hit with some tragic news 10 days before we were supposed to fly out.
[time=663] There were moments where we were even wrestling, should we even go?
[time=666] Is it the good thing to do?
[time=668] And actually, let me share with you what Pastor Kelly told me
[time=674] that was just so helpful in that moment.
[time=677] I went to see him and I said, "You know, Pastor Kelly, "we just found out about the baby." And I sort of just wanna crawl in a hole and not see anybody for about a year.
[time=689] I don't wanna lead worship ever again.
[time=691] I don't wanna go to the Czech Republic, I don't wanna.
[time=693] And he's just listening and nodding and things like that.
[time=697] But he told me, and it was great advice.
[time=699] He said, "You need to ask God "if he wants you to go to the Czech Republic "because God could have a really big plan for Zoe "while you're there." And then he said this, which was so freeing.
[time=712] He said, "Corbin, if you guys stay home "and just be sad, that is okay.
[time=719] "And you have every right to do it." And he said, "And if you go to the Czech Republic "and do missions work 10 days "after you find out about your baby, "you're not super Christian, so don't get a big head." And it was so freeing.
[time=733] I just felt like I didn't have any pressure from him to go or any pressure from him to stay home.
[time=738] And we could just seek the Lord on it.
[time=740] And we did together and we felt like we should go.
[time=743] The first day we're at the conference, we sit down with our friends who invited us and we tell them about it and we cry together, we pray together and we're just like oh, what do we do?
[time=752] And our friends look at us and they say, "You don't know the theme of our conference this year." But God laid on our hearts to do a whole conference for these missionaries about faith that amazes.
[time=763] And we wanna do a whole conference that focuses on strengthening and building each other's faith because they're doing some hard work in that mission field.
[time=771] And they actually said tomorrow night, we're doing a whole session on faith that amazes in the midst of suffering and would you, Corbin and Tanya, be willing to share your story with all of the missionaries to give them some hope in the midst of their suffering and circumstances.
[time=789] So we did and it was incredible and God carried us through it and we sort of blubbered through the whole thing.
[time=795] But it was good and God used it and we felt so fruitful
[time=801] in our week over there with the adults and with the kids.
[time=804] And we left home and we were on the plane and we just said, you know what, our hearts are fuller than when we left.
[time=809] We went there to serve and pour ourselves out, but God had used those people strategically to fill up our hearts and to point us to the truth and it was a sweet, sweet time.
[time=820] So we're just convinced that God has a plan and that he's working through all of this.
[time=827] Another thing I wanted to share with you, it's so hard in situations like this to know how to pray.
[time=835] When you've got a baby that the doctors say is gonna die, you're obviously thankful for that information, but we know that we serve a healer and we serve a God who can do all things.
[time=850] And my goodness, he created this whole world out of absolutely nothing.
[time=854] And so the fact that my daughter doesn't have a brain doesn't mean that he can't just speak one into existence.
[time=861] And so I wanna have the faith to believe that and pray and ask for that.
[time=865] But at the same time, God often chooses not to heal.
[time=872] And so I wanna be ready for that and understand that that might be a good and okay thing too.
[time=877] My mom spoke some really encouraging words to me
[time=883] and I'm just gonna pass them on to you 'cause I thought it was really good.
[time=887] She reminded me that Jesus walks on, was able to walk on water and he did and he proved it and he showed us.
[time=894] But usually when he wanted to get from point A to point B, he just walked on the road.
[time=899] He just took sort of the natural way of doing things.
[time=902] That's what makes the supernatural so supernatural because it doesn't happen very often.
[time=906] And we wouldn't be amazed by Jesus walking on water if he just did it all the time.
[time=911] Well, maybe we would.
[time=913] But if everybody was walking on the water all the time, I think you get my point.
[time=917] I don't know if God's gonna do a walk on water type of thing in July with my baby or not.
[time=922] I believe that he can.
[time=924] I hope that he will.
[time=925] But I know that usually babies that don't have a brain don't live.
[time=930] And I wanna have peace and be okay with that reality too.
[time=933] So here's what you can pray.
[time=935] You can pray that God does a miracle.
[time=937] I'm really okay with that.
[time=939] And you can also pray that God will give us his grace to sustain us through a really, really hard season if so he doesn't live.
[time=947] But even more than that, you can just pray that his will be done because that's what we really want.
[time=954] Just because it's hard for me doesn't mean that it's bad.
[time=958] Just because it's a difficult season doesn't mean that it's gonna end up being all for not or any less precious.
[time=966] It's already been precious for the last month with my wife, with my kids, with my God, with my baby inside Tanya's womb.
[time=974] It's been good.
[time=977] And let me share one verse with you before we sing again.
[time=981] Just three days after we found out about all of this,
[time=988] God would have it that I came across this verse 'cause I wasn't reading Isaiah 48.
[time=993] It was something cool that he kind of led me to.
[time=996] And Isaiah 48 says, I am the Lord your God who teaches you what is best for you, who leads you in the way you should go.
[time=1007] And that verse was just like Sav on an open wound in my heart because I was doubting that God had led us in the way that we should go.
[time=1018] And I was doubting that he had good plans for us.
[time=1021] But when I read that, my confidence just shot up.
[time=1025] That God has good plans.
[time=1027] He's sovereign and he knows what's best for us.
[time=1029] And he's gonna lead us in the way that we should go even if it is through the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=1036] And it's gonna be sweet and good with him.
[time=1039] And you know what?
[time=1040] Perhaps you're going through hard stuff today.
[time=1043] So many of you have told us that you've actually walked to the very same road we're on right now and we had no idea.
[time=1050] And you know what it's like to experience what we're experiencing.
[time=1054] And perhaps some of you have different situations that are hard or confusing or a big challenge in your life today.
[time=1061] Know that God has plans to teach you what is best for you.
[time=1066] And know that God is gonna lead you in the way that you should go.
[time=1069] We wanna worship God together, not because it's comfortable, but because he deserves to be worshiped even in the good seasons and bad seasons.
[time=1080] So I wanna invite you to stand to your feet again and we're gonna sing a couple prayers together.
[time=1092] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 240 seconds]
[time=1343] (gentle music) - We're gonna look through a portion
[time=1360] of First Timothy chapter five this morning.
[time=1364] The first couple verses.
[time=1367] Paul writes to Timothy, you know, he's been telling Timothy in this letter.
[time=1374] He's been telling Timothy who Timothy should be and how he should behave and what he should teach and how others in Ephesus should respond to that teaching.
[time=1390] It's a great letter.
[time=1392] And when I read the first two verses of this chapter,
[time=1400] do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him, encourage him, come alongside him.
[time=1407] As if he were your father.
[time=1413] Treat younger men as brothers,
[time=1420] older women as mothers and younger women as sisters with absolute purity.
[time=1429] Can you imagine a church where every person in the congregation just practiced those principles?
[time=1441] Not complicated.
[time=1445] Treat older men as you should treat a father.
[time=1450] The Bible says that we are to honor and respect our fathers.
[time=1454] It's always said that.
[time=1457] Old Testament said it, so does the New Testament say it.
[time=1460] If each of us treated every older person, I'm glad I'm getting older.
[time=1464] A lot of you can treat me this way now.
[time=1466] If every one of us treated every older man the way we should treat our father.
[time=1474] If we treated every younger man the way we should treat our brother.
[time=1485] And if in all purity we treated every younger woman as a younger, protecting this younger sister.
[time=1493] I remember driving down the street years and years ago.
[time=1499] And I'd see some young girls walking to school.
[time=1506] Dressed in ways that didn't protect them.
[time=1516] And my heart would just ache.
[time=1517] I just want to take them home and say, I don't want you to look like this.
[time=1522] This doesn't protect you.
[time=1524] This makes you vulnerable.
[time=1528] Going to middle school.
[time=1533] Looking like somebody they'd seen on television or in the movies.
[time=1538] Dressed sensually.
[time=1541] And my heart would just ache.
[time=1545] And I've had a burden for younger women like that most of my life.
[time=1549] This isn't first service.
[time=1552] Nance hadn't been around somebody who hugs younger women as much as I do.
[time=1557] And at first she thought this is weird.
[time=1560] Even my own daughter.
[time=1562] But when you love them appropriately with all purity you are a protector.
[time=1569] The way a brother should be protecting a younger sister.
[time=1573] The way a father should be protecting a daughter.
[time=1576] And I challenge you.
[time=1579] Let's protect our daughters.
[time=1581] Let's protect and love our younger men appropriately as brothers.
[time=1588] Respect and honor our older men and older women as we should be treating fathers and mothers.
[time=1594] Can you imagine what Black Hawk would be like if each of us did that all the time?
[time=1602] How many more principles would you need than that?
[time=1604] So I love that.
[time=1610] I think it's a great definition of humility to just read these two verses and then flesh out what that looks like.
[time=1618] I wanna be a humble man
[time=1625] who treats older men and women and younger men and women the way God wants me to.
[time=1633] Can you imagine a place like that?
[time=1637] Well, the next section of this scripture
[time=1646] I gave the title to Judy last week because this is the bulk of the message.
[time=1650] The title was Your, each of you and our, me included with all of you, care for widows.
[time=1665] This chapter has a lot to say about how you need to be taking care of the widows in your family.
[time=1673] And it has a lot to say about how we collectively need to be sure that we are taking care of the widows who don't have family to take care of them.
[time=1686] That's the church's role in a widow who's indeed a widow.
[time=1691] So let's stand and we'll read verses one through 16 of chapter five.
[time=1698] Do not rebuke an older man harshly
[time=1706] but exhort him as if he were your father.
[time=1709] Treat younger men as brothers, older women as mothers and younger women as sisters with absolute purity.
[time=1715] Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need.
[time=1720] But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents.
[time=1736] For this is pleasing to God.
[time=1738] The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and ask God for help.
[time=1750] But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.
[time=1755] Give the people these instructions too so that no one may be open to blame.
[time=1761] If anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
[time=1773] Hmm, no widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is sober 60 has been faithful to her husband and is well known for her good deeds such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the saints, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds.
[time=1790] As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list
[time=1796] for when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry.
[time=1802] Thus they bring judgment on themselves because they have broken their first pledge.
[time=1805] Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house and not only do they become idlers but also gossips and busy bodies, saying things they ought not to.
[time=1818] So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
[time=1826] Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan.
[time=1831] If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family, she should help them and not let the church be burdened with them so that the church can help those widows who are really in need.
[time=1845] Our Father in Heaven seems like, Lord, there's some real practical things you want us to learn here.
[time=1855] Sounds hard.
[time=1859] Sometimes it's really hard.
[time=1861] We need your power.
[time=1863] Please help us understand what we need to do, each of us, in order to bring you the pleasure that we want to bring you, to bring you the glory and the honor, do your name.
[time=1874] Please help us understand this and empower us to do it.
[time=1880] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1883] I think she can be seated.
[time=1884] Well, verse three, give proper recognition.
[time=1891] Let's first talk about your widows.
[time=1896] Yours.
[time=1899] Verse three says there are widows that we're gonna put on a list.
[time=1906] Your widows, the ones I'm talking about when I say your individual widows, let's look at verse four.
[time=1913] But if a widow has children or grandchildren, he should learn, first of all, to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents for this is pleasing to God.
[time=1928] I was less than 28 because I was 28 when I came here.
[time=1934] So I don't know how old I was, but I understood this passage or Reddit understood it for the first time and it just smacked me so hard because I'd heard my dad for years say, you don't owe me anything.
[time=1951] You don't owe us anything.
[time=1957] I felt indebted to my parents.
[time=1960] I felt indebted because I was.
[time=1963] And then I read this and it said I needed to repay them,
[time=1970] my parents and grandparents.
[time=1972] So I went to dad, I read this whole chapter and I went to dad and I just said, dad, there's a passage in the Bible that has been teaching me that I need to be concerned about you and plan ahead.
[time=1984] And he said, no, I've told you forever, you'd be prepared to take care of your mother and your sisters, but not him.
[time=1992] Well, this says relatives up here a little later, not just widows.
[time=1997] And I said, dad, the Bible says I owe you.
[time=2000] And he said, I've told you, you don't owe me.
[time=2002] I said, dad, the Bible says I owe you.
[time=2005] So God says I owe you and I feel like I owe you.
[time=2009] Won't you let me plan ahead to meet your needs
[time=2015] when you can't meet your own needs?
[time=2018] Hard conversation.
[time=2020] Finally, I said, okay, would you just let me take care
[time=2027] of you for only 22 years like you did me?
[time=2030] Then on year 23, I'm cutting you off.
[time=2032] And he laughed like that.
[time=2034] I said, I'm only gonna change your diapers for two and a half years.
[time=2037] We did that.
[time=2041] He laughed, we chuckled.
[time=2049] As time went on, dad didn't end up needing our help.
[time=2054] He died while mom was still well and we did our part, but we didn't have to have him in our home.
[time=2059] Mom was 60 when he died.
[time=2064] She met these standards that are in here, but she had family.
[time=2069] So the church wasn't responsible to take care of my mom.
[time=2073] It says, Eduardo has children or grandchildren.
[time=2080] They should first of all, learn to put their religion into practice.
[time=2082] Remember what the book of James says in James 127?
[time=2086] It says that pure and adulterated religion is that we will take care of orphans and widows.
[time=2095] Verse seven and eight says that we're to provide
[time=2107] for all of our relatives.
[time=2108] Oh my goodness.
[time=2109] Give the people these instructions to, he said to Timothy.
[time=2113] So that no one may be open to blame.
[time=2117] If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially those in his household, his immediate relatives, that one made me think, oh my goodness, you mean God would appreciate it and like it if I saw my uncles and aunts and cousins, as people I should consider taking care of.
[time=2139] The answer to that I believe is yes.
[time=2141] I believe that pleases God.
[time=2145] And I'm to blame, especially if I don't take care of those in my immediate household.
[time=2151] And then the dagger, when I read this, it says if a person hasn't taken care of his relatives and immediate family, he has denied the faith.
[time=2164] James says faith without works is dead.
[time=2168] The works of meeting the needs of the widows in our family.
[time=2174] Bring life to my faith.
[time=2180] And then the word of God is living in active, sharper than any double edged sword pierces your heart.
[time=2186] Then the dagger came in.
[time=2187] I read this worse than an unbeliever.
[time=2190] Denied the faith worse than an unbeliever.
[time=2197] If the Bible says that that's true about me if I don't do something, I want to know what that something is.
[time=2203] And in our culture,
[time=2210] it has become so difficult for us to meet the needs of extended family, partly because we're not in proximity to each other.
[time=2220] In the 50s and 60s, people started moving away from home more and more and more.
[time=2227] And it is hard work and very sacrificial sometimes to meet the needs
[time=2235] that our relatives have in our own families.
[time=2241] (chuckling) But I think it's clear.
[time=2244] This week in preparation for this, I was thinking a lot about how I've taught this for years.
[time=2253] I told you, I learned it in my 20s.
[time=2255] I taught at the high school kids and teachers and I've talked about it.
[time=2258] I've taught this all over the place.
[time=2259] Never done it here, up here.
[time=2261] But I was telling Nancy just this morning, I was struggling this week because we built a house
[time=2270] that is old people unfriendly.
[time=2273] The bedroom that's downstairs is ours.
[time=2282] When mom needed to be at our house sometimes,
[time=2288] we'd just move her in there.
[time=2290] Nancy's been incredible.
[time=2294] Renee, my first wife helped take care of my mother.
[time=2300] Nancy, my second wife, has helped take care of my mother until she died.
[time=2305] And we're planning on, listen to this, taking care of Renee's dad.
[time=2311] She's planning on it.
[time=2312] We've been talking with him about it.
[time=2315] Why?
[time=2319] He's ours.
[time=2324] He's our family.
[time=2325] He's our children's grandfather.
[time=2330] I wish we built the house differently.
[time=2332] We gotta think that through.
[time=2335] Then, verse 16.
[time=2340] Women, make sure you care for the widows in your family, it says.
[time=2345] If any woman who has a believer has widows in her family, she should help them and not let the church be burdened with them so that the church can help those widows who are really in need.
[time=2357] Women, if there's a widow in your family, women and men, if there's a relative whose needs are not being met.
[time=2369] Figure out how you're gonna do it.
[time=2374] It pleases God.
[time=2375] The church's resources need to go to the widows
[time=2385] who have no family.
[time=2388] The time and money that it takes, the church to meet the needs of a widow.
[time=2396] I've been so, we have a couple A.B.Fs that met first hour, some of you are in here now.
[time=2402] You've been taking care of each other.
[time=2403] I have watched as you have taken care of each other, especially the leaders in those classes.
[time=2412] That's the church taking care of some people who need help.
[time=2418] If you are a widow and you meet the next qualifications that we're gonna work over, we want to help.
[time=2426] Well, my mom got to be, she was 60 when Dad died,
[time=2434] and she was able to fend for herself.
[time=2438] She had a house, lived in that for a while.
[time=2440] My brother lived next door.
[time=2441] My sister lived in the same town.
[time=2445] And then mom got old enough at about 74 that she needed some additional help.
[time=2454] So my sister and my brother-in-law just remodeled part of their house and mom moved in.
[time=2460] People do that, a lot of you've done that.
[time=2461] I've seen you do it.
[time=2462] And from 74 to 84, she lived with them.
[time=2468] And there were four children, so the other three of us took turns trying to help.
[time=2475] We'd do our two weeks here and there and give them a break and have something at Christmas or whatever.
[time=2480] But my sister Sherry and her husband,
[time=2486] they repaid.
[time=2489] And I've thought, wow, if I'd lived there
[time=2499] and mom would have been willing, would I have been willing to repay at that level?
[time=2504] They repaid, because she got Alzheimer's.
[time=2507] And for about the last six years of the 10 she lived with them,
[time=2513] they gave up more and more and more of what they liked to do and did more and more and more of what she needed them to do.
[time=2529] Now I'm indebted to them.
[time=2531] I owed her, they repay her.
[time=2533] Now I'm indebted, I really feel that way.
[time=2536] I'm so thankful that they were willing to do that.
[time=2539] I just want to tell you one quick one
[time=2546] that Romans eight prayer, Holy Spirit prayer, I was telling you about my mom on the phone.
[time=2551] I talk to her every week and we talk and as she got less and less able to speak, she still would listen.
[time=2559] I often would sing hymns to her on the phone.
[time=2562] Not that well, but I'd sing hymns and she joined me sometimes because it's amazing.
[time=2567] Those hymns are just in there and they'd just come out.
[time=2570] And one Saturday, not long before she died, Nancy and I had her on the speaker phone and I'm singing away and stuff.
[time=2577] And at the end I said, "Mom, would you like to pray?" Nothing on the other end.
[time=2583] I said, "I always prayed with her on the phone, "but I prayed and she hadn't prayed for it.
[time=2587] "I don't know how long, more than a year." No answer, I said, "Mom, are you there?" She goes, "Yeah." I said, "Would you like to pray?" "Yeah." I waited and waited.
[time=2602] I thought she might have hung up 'cause she did that often to me in the middle of me singing.
[time=2606] I'd finished three verses and find out she hadn't heard any of them.
[time=2609] (congregation laughing) She said, "Yeah." And then she prayed this prayer.
[time=2618] (congregation laughing) She goes, "Lord, I don't know the words." That was it.
[time=2628] And I said, "Mom, that is the best prayer you can pray."
[time=2635] He says, "He will groan for you in utterances "that you don't comprehend in the will of the Father.
[time=2641] "The Spirit of God will pray." And my mom hadn't said my name and I don't know how long she went.
[time=2645] "Thank you, Stevie." Oh boy, that was good.
[time=2649] She needed a lot of care.
[time=2655] My sister and the rest of us, too, a little bit,
[time=2661] gave it to her.
[time=2662] She died a couple years ago.
[time=2671] Well, then verse three, that's your widows.
[time=2676] I hope you're taking care of them.
[time=2681] Verse three, our widows.
[time=2683] These are ours.
[time=2684] Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need.
[time=2689] Now here's how you know who's really in need.
[time=2692] Go to verse five.
[time=2696] Verse five says, "The widow who is really in need "and left all alone puts her hope in God "and continues night and day to pray "and ask God for help." Some of us, you may be in the room right here.
[time=2710] Some of us were at Anna Juries' home in New Haven a few years ago.
[time=2715] We were doing some yard work for her.
[time=2716] Anna kept coming out and giving us cookies and stuff and she finally, at the end of the morning, we finished messing around cleaning up her yard.
[time=2726] She said, "I wish I could do something for you." And I said, "Anna, you can pray for us.
[time=2732] "Would you pray?" And she goes, "Oh, Steve, I do that every day." And she did.
[time=2740] She prayed for us every day.
[time=2746] That's one of the characteristics you can look for in a widow who deserves to be on the list.
[time=2753] He says, "They pray and ask God for help, "but the widow who lives for pleasure." Oh, I'm sorry, we don't want to go there.
[time=2761] Verse, that's verse five.
[time=2762] Now, verse nine, "No widow may be put on the list "of widows unless she is over 60." Don't know why Paul picked 60, but he told Timothy 60.
[time=2774] A lot of these things are contextual about Ephesus in these days.
[time=2778] Don't know what a 60-year-old woman was like exactly in those days, but he said she had to be at least 60.
[time=2786] And has been faithful to her husband.
[time=2788] And is well-known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the saints, helping those in trouble, devoting herself to all kinds of deeds.
[time=2801] In general, this woman's known for being a servant and doing good deeds for people.
[time=2808] And I loved it.
[time=2809] The first good in that passage, good deeds, it's a little bit different than the last one that says good deeds as well in the NIV.
[time=2817] The first good, you can really translate that beautiful.
[time=2821] And I thought, oh my goodness, this is a great, this list of good deeds is a great way to see who a beautiful woman is.
[time=2830] This is a beautiful woman.
[time=2832] Often wondered who people would marry if everybody was blind.
[time=2846] I think people would marry this beautiful woman who did really good deeds.
[time=2853] Notice it says such as, these aren't mandates
[time=2861] saying that in 2011, you need to be washing the saints' feet in order to be on the list.
[time=2867] We don't do that here.
[time=2869] Common there, servants washed feet.
[time=2876] Then verse 11 says, as for younger widows, don't put them on such a list for when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ they want to marry.
[time=2885] Thus they bring judgment on themselves because they've broken their first pledge.
[time=2890] Interesting.
[time=2892] You know, Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter 7 that if you're single, he wants you to stay single.
[time=2900] So you'll have opportunity to serve God.
[time=2904] Not that you have to stay single, but he just says it's good.
[time=2907] Here he wants widows who have been married.
[time=2910] He's saying we want younger widows to marry again.
[time=2913] And maybe there's something about Ephesus context there too that we don't know.
[time=2917] Thus they bring judgment on themselves
[time=2923] because they've broken their first pledge.
[time=2924] There was a pledge, there was this relationship with Christ that was so evident, these widows, excuse me, who were put on the list, had such a relationship with Christ they didn't need a husband.
[time=2935] Besides, they get into the habit of being idle
[time=2947] and going about from house to house.
[time=2950] Not only do they become idlers, but also gossip some busy bodies, saying things they ought not to.
[time=2954] So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and give an enemy no opportunity for slander.
[time=2962] Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan.
[time=2966] She needs to be faithful to her husband,
[time=2972] over 60, full of good deeds.
[time=2976] Not a younger widow, because younger widows have a tendency, like most of us, to yield to the pressures
[time=2986] of our sensual desires.
[time=2990] It reminded me of Ephesians 4, Ephesians 4, 19.
[time=2995] May come up here.
[time=2998] If not, I'll read it to you.
[time=3003] There it is.
[time=3006] 4, 19, it says, "Having lost all sensitivity."
[time=3012] Talking about the Gentiles here.
[time=3014] Talking about the person I was before Christ.
[time=3021] Having lost all sensitivity, they've given themselves over to sensuality.
[time=3028] So as to indulge in every kind of impurity
[time=3034] with a continual lust for more.
[time=3037] There's a reality about our sensuality.
[time=3048] In our sinfulness, we lost our sensitivity.
[time=3051] Sensitivity, being sensitive to what's best for you
[time=3058] and what brings you appropriate pleasure.
[time=3061] What's best for you?
[time=3065] If I'm sensitive, it's not that I'm wearing my feelings on my sleeve, it's that I'm sensitive to your needs, but having lost that, Gentiles.
[time=3078] They're an Ephesians, an Ephesus.
[time=3080] Gave themselves over, we did, to sensuality,
[time=3086] to satisfying our senses.
[time=3089] So when I talked earlier about being a giver or a taker, when I'm a giver, I'm looking out for your interest and I'm sensitive to your needs.
[time=3101] If I'm a taker, I'm looking at you as opportunity to meet my needs.
[time=3109] Then he never likes it when I use the word predator, but predators versus protectors.
[time=3117] Are you a protector?
[time=3120] All right, are you looking out for the interests of others?
[time=3126] Are you sensitive?
[time=3128] He's saying the younger widows have a propensity toward being sensual rather than sensitive.
[time=3138] And he says, they also have a tendency if you enable them to, if you give them free time to, because you're providing for them, they will become idle and idle isn't good.
[time=3156] You see, that woman we described a minute ago,
[time=3162] that widow who is doing good deeds, nothing idle in that list.
[time=3168] There's nothing idle there.
[time=3172] That's a very busy, very busy person.
[time=3175] And Paul just warns Timothy, don't put women on the list who aren't busy serving and who are too young because it'll lead to gossip.
[time=3187] It leads to slander.
[time=3193] I think there's much for us to learn there as a nation.
[time=3198] Look at verse 14.
[time=3212] So I counsel younger widows, here's counsel,
[time=3221] not a command, it's counsel, younger women, younger widows to marry, have children manage their homes and give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
[time=3234] And then the bad news, he says, some already have, sad.
[time=3238] How are you doing?
[time=3248] How are you doing with your widows?
[time=3256] I think it's really important for us to take note of 1 Timothy 5 and wrestle with the uncomfortable reality
[time=3266] that there may be some relatives in our life who need our help and God's saying, love them.
[time=3273] Thank you very much.
[time=3278] (mouse clicking) Love them.
[time=3283] How are we doing?
[time=3288] Do you know widows in our church who need our help
[time=3294] and we aren't helping them?
[time=3297] When my mom died, we were sitting in my brother,
[time=3304] my sister's house and the four kids were talking.
[time=3309] And we just started reminiscing and somebody said, "Mom always had a widow." And we all just said, yeah, that's true and started to go on.
[time=3318] And I thought about it first thing, I said, wait a minute,
[time=3324] what a thing to say.
[time=3326] "Mom always had a widow." She did.
[time=3335] We grew up. Mom always had a widow.
[time=3339] She took them to the grocery store, different widows, they died.
[time=3344] She took them to the doctor.
[time=3348] She took them to the dentist.
[time=3349] She took them to the pharmacist and I mowed their grass and she always had one.
[time=3358] That struck me.
[time=3366] Do you have a widow?
[time=3367] Lord, help us as we try to take care of those that are ours
[time=3376] and our own families.
[time=3377] Those that are ours collectively as a church.
[time=3383] God, please help us.
[time=3384] We don't want to fall short on this.
[time=3387] Please help us in Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3394] Well, this morning we wanted to wait until the end of the service so you'd all be here.
[time=3398] It's Memorial Day.
[time=3399] It used to be Decoration Day and we decorated the grave sides of the fallen military service people
[time=3411] that had represented us.
[time=3414] And it's grown to the point now we want to recognize those of you that served as well and didn't die.
[time=3421] We're thankful and we want to pray for our troops that are overseas now and that are serving us here in the U.S. now.
[time=3428] So as a customer at our church, just like for anybody that's served in the military here in the U.S., would you please stand so we can recognize who you are?
[time=3437] Please stand.
[time=3439] (audience applauds)
[time=3451] - Thank you, thank you very much.
[time=3453] Thanks for serving.
[time=3459] I'm so grateful.
[time=3460] We're all grateful.
[time=3463] Lord, we pray for our troops.
[time=3467] God, I pray for the people who are making decisions that impact our men and women in the service.
[time=3475] I pray, God, you give them wisdom.
[time=3479] I pray you'd protect our troops.
[time=3481] And I pray that we would do your bidding, not ours.
[time=3486] Please help us.
[time=3487] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3490] (upbeat music)
