[time=1007] God, I also ask of you this morning to please be faithful to your promise.
[time=1014] That the word of God is sharper than a double-edged sword and it will pierce our souls.
[time=1022] I pray, God, that you would speak to us through your word today.
[time=1026] As we open up those pages that were written thousands of years ago,
[time=1032] would you use them to penetrate our circumstances today?
[time=1037] And would you do as you will in the speaking?
[time=1046] Your word tells us that your ways are higher than our ways and so we don't want to presume to know what you'll have for us as we read and think and pray.
[time=1055] And we just pray that your will would be done on this earth and in our church
[time=1061] and in the hearts of every person here in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1070] Hey, open your Bibles to 1 Timothy chapter 5.
[time=1072] I'm so thankful for the work that Steve Longbreak did last week as he came and continued in our series that we've entitled True Church, God's design for the body, for the body of Christ, the church.
[time=1084] Steve started us out at the beginning of chapter 5, taught last week through the idea and the concept of widows and how they are to be provided for.
[time=1093] And we come now this morning to chapter 5 verses 17 on through the end of the chapter.
[time=1100] And as we come to the end of chapter 5 with just chapter 6 still in view, I want to say this to all of you who are here this morning.
[time=1108] I want to say this to all who are in the family here at Blackhawk.
[time=1112] It's been several months in this study and I want to just say to each and every one of you, "Hey, why don't we finish strong?" Let's just do everything we can with God's help to open our hearts and our eyes
[time=1126] and our minds to what God would have for us in these last few pages
[time=1132] of what has been an astounding study.
[time=1134] I'm so encouraged by the letters I get from the emails that you send in, from the conversations I get to have with those who have been so impacted by the great truth of Paul's letter to his child in the faith, Timothy, who's pastoring here in this church at Ephesus.
[time=1152] And I think as we come to the end, I want to just invite you to really finish strong.
[time=1157] In fact, let me invite you to do this. We're coming to chapter 6 next week.
[time=1162] And I said this first hour, I'll say it again, second hour, and there were a lot of folks who talked to me afterwards and I think you're going to take me up on this.
[time=1170] How about you do this?
[time=1172] How about as we finish strong in these next couple, two or three weeks?
[time=1175] How about you beginning today when you get home tonight, you know, before you head out the door tomorrow?
[time=1181] How about we just commit to read chapter 6 once or twice a day?
[time=1185] We've been talking a lot lately about the great value and the great blessing of Bible reading.
[time=1192] Bible study is good, but sometimes it really just helps to read it and allow it to sink in.
[time=1198] So how about we as a family as we come to the end of the study?
[time=1201] Would you make a commitment today to read with me chapter 6 on a daily basis?
[time=1206] Maybe once or twice a day and just see what God will do.
[time=1210] As you hide His word in your heart, as we take it in on a regular basis, then we come together in our gathering and teach on chapter 6.
[time=1219] Let's see what God would do with the great truth of that chapter.
[time=1223] So collectively, what do you say? Let's do that.
[time=1226] Let's commit to reading chapter 6 as the days go by this week and we'll come together next week and jump into it together.
[time=1233] Today, let's come back to chapter 5, verses 17 through the end of the chapter.
[time=1238] And as we come to our passage today, what we'll see is that this very important section of Paul's letter
[time=1245] is really divided up into two parts, two parts today.
[time=1249] An initial section found here in verses 17 and 18 having to do with the generous compensation for those who preach and teach.
[time=1260] I tried to get Steve to do this last week, but he wouldn't, so I'm going to do this and we're going to get through it here.
[time=1267] The generous compensate really does speak to this in the Bible, not making this up.
[time=1272] The generous compensation for those who preach and teach.
[time=1275] And then we're going to look at a second section, verses 19 to 24 having to do with some general exhortations
[time=1284] and general principles for dealing with elders.
[time=1287] I want us to look briefly this morning at both sections.
[time=1290] And then we will, like I said in the days to come, move on to chapter 6.
[time=1295] And chapter 6, let me just say this real quick.
[time=1298] Here's a little trailer. You go to a movie early, you sit and watch the trailers, right?
[time=1303] Right? All right, good. I just sometimes want to make sure you're there.
[time=1308] You go to chapter 6, look at it real quick. I want to just read this to you.
[time=1312] I just want you, there's a little promo of what's coming with chapter 6.
[time=1315] So important that we all understand this.
[time=1317] All who are under the yoke as slaves, six one.
[time=1320] All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor
[time=1331] so that the name of God and our doctrine will not be spoken against.
[time=1339] This is where we will go in the weeks to come, and there's more in chapter 6 to get to.
[time=1344] But my friends, I just want you to see that real quick, a little quick window here.
[time=1348] We're going to learn about how important it is that in your life and mine, in whatever way we find ourselves under the authority, slaves, masters,
[time=1359] that's what that's talking about. It's talking about you finding yourself under the authority of someone else.
[time=1367] It could be an employer. It could be a coach. It could be a teacher.
[time=1371] It could make all kinds of application here.
[time=1374] But the principle is that the way in which you and I live out our faith
[time=1380] under the authority of another goes a long way, one way or the other
[time=1387] in making much or making little of God.
[time=1392] God's name, God's doctrine, it says, is at stake.
[time=1398] And the way you and I conduct ourselves under the authority of others.
[time=1404] It makes me want to just teach it right now, but we'll wait.
[time=1408] We'll come back to that next week. Today, let's come to two sections, general compensation for those who preach and teach in general exhortation for dealing with elders. Look with me at verses 17 and 18 of 1 Timothy 5.
[time=1422] The elders that says, who rule well, are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially or in particular those who work hard
[time=1433] at preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says, you shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing, and the laborer is worthy of his wages.
[time=1446] Those who preach and teach worthy of double honor, you shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing, and the laborer is worthy of his wages.
[time=1458] All right, well, I think there's a picture here coming up.
[time=1462] One might say there's an elephant in the room, and the elephant you say, what's the elephant in the room? Well, if I'm going to just say it to you straight, which I like to do, I'm the primary preaching-teaching elder here at Blackhawk.
[time=1479] Does that make sense? All right.
[time=1484] I'm the primary preaching-teaching elder here at Blackhawk, and the Scriptures are teaching us here in this context that if I work hard at using my gift and do it well, then you should pay me.
[time=1495] The Scripture says a double portion.
[time=1499] You should pay me a double portion with double honor.
[time=1502] This phrase means that you are to compensate that man generously.
[time=1508] And some in the younger crowd, I hear him talk.
[time=1513] You know, I try to pick up on younger people's lingo, and some at this point might say awkward.
[time=1519] (Laughter) But I'm just here to tell you, honestly, I've been looking forward to this.
[time=1526] I'm just here to tell you, it's not awkward.
[time=1529] In your case, in my case, in this situation, it's not awkward, because you know what?
[time=1536] This place, and our elders, and you as a family, for 15 going on 16 years, have been nothing but generous with me.
[time=1549] You have provided for me, you have encouraged me, you have walked alongside me and my family.
[time=1557] The elders have, as far as compensation, as far as financially that we have never, ever been, and want, ever. Not even close.
[time=1569] The prayers that you all have prayed, the gifts that you all have given, the kindness and thoughtfulness that you have expressed.
[time=1578] When you add it all up, and if we were going to just make sides, and if you were going to ask me about all the heartache, and all the nasty letters, and all the difficult conversations, and all the ungrateful, you know, doesn't even compare to the generosity that our elders have shown me and the kindness that this family has extended to the birds.
[time=1600] So, no elephant in the room, not awkward.
[time=1604] The scriptures say that you should do this and this family, and your leadership has.
[time=1611] Amen? It's a good thing.
[time=1613] It's a good thing. Now, there are places that aren't like this.
[time=1618] And I'll tell you what, my heart breaks, it really does.
[time=1622] For guys who I know, who stand and do what I do, and live my life, and give themselves to the things that God has called me to here with you, and they don't get a double portion. They don't get honored.
[time=1634] It's tough. It's difficult. There's a strain, and it's not healthy, and it's a sad representation, and it's not what God designed.
[time=1643] And so, if any of those people out there are listening today, you may be watching the broadcast, and you may have something to do with honoring a preaching or teaching elder.
[time=1653] If anyone in earshot of my voice, and forget my voice, if anyone in earshot of this truth is in that situation, I would just plead with you to think through and revisit how you treat and how you come alongside and how you provide for those who faithfully work hard at preaching and teaching.
[time=1673] And let me just say this as it relates to the working hard at preaching and teaching. I work hard at it, and I want you to understand why I work so hard at this.
[time=1687] I don't work so hard at it because I want you to like me.
[time=1691] I don't work so hard at this because I want to impress you.
[time=1695] I work so hard at this, and this is so important to me because I believe the preaching and teaching of God's Word to the people of God so that they can do the work of God is the highest calling in the world.
[time=1716] I have great respect for so many of you who do what you do.
[time=1719] You know that. I respect what you do. What I do?
[time=1723] When I study this and communicate this to you, it's the most important thing in the world.
[time=1728] And how in the world I got to do this, I'll never know, but it's the most important thing in the world.
[time=1735] And what a privilege for me to get to do it, and I want to do it well because I want to honor God and I want to help the people of God be all that He designed you to be so that we as a church can be all that He designed us to be.
[time=1749] And I work hard at it. I want to do well with it.
[time=1753] J. Oswald Sanders, I've read it for years.
[time=1757] He talks about how mediocrity comes from the unwillingness to make the excellent effort required.
[time=1766] He goes on to say that the willingness to renounce personal preferences, which oftentimes you have to do in this line of work, the willingness to renounce personal preferences, to sacrifice legitimate and natural desires for the sake of something beyond you,
[time=1784] for the sake of His kingdom, these are the things that will characterize those marked out by God for positions of influence in His work.
[time=1795] Anybody who's going to influence for the kingdom is going to have to pay a price.
[time=1801] You're going to have to give yourself completely and work very, very hard at the things God has given you to do.
[time=1809] And so I'm trying to do that, and I know others who try and do that preaching and teaching. If you look in the text here, it says preaching and teaching.
[time=1816] You understand the difference between the two. It's an interesting study.
[time=1820] Preaching is from the Greek word logos and literally means to give a speech.
[time=1826] To give a speech, it means preaching means a public proclamation of the truth that's done in such a way that it includes exhortation and admonition.
[time=1837] Preaching, you see, stirs the soul. Preaching, my friends, is meant to inspire.
[time=1843] Teaching, on the other hand, translates, didosca lea is the Greek word there.
[time=1849] It emphasizes the idea of instruction more than inspiration, if you will.
[time=1856] Teaching is an interesting study.
[time=1861] Teaching is more about proclamation.
[time=1863] Preaching calls for a heart response to God while teaching is a necessary effort against heresy or false teaching.
[time=1872] Teaching informs the mind and the intellect, preaching moves the soul.
[time=1879] Not all, and I quote here, not all elders, will carry the same burden of preaching and teaching. Some may teach or preach infrequently.
[time=1888] Some will do it constantly. Those whose preaching ministry demands all their attention should be freed from any need at all to earn a living and be cared for and even rewarded for their singular devotion.
[time=1904] The context here in 1 Timothy 5, it's interesting, Paul, supports this point by quoting from both the Old and New Testaments.
[time=1913] He says at the beginning here, he says, "You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing." I don't know what kind of mental picture you get
[time=1923] when you look at me and think of an ox threshing, but it says here that you're not supposed to muzzle the ox while he is threshing.
[time=1931] It's actually a quote from Deuteronomy 25, and the meaning of this is pretty simple.
[time=1937] The Old Testament law allowed for it provided that the oxen who threshed the grain,
[time=1946] you understand that they were hooked up to these circular threshing floors and they were on these poles that came out and they hooked the oxen up and the oxen just walked around, and as they walked, they crushed, they threshed the grain, they flattened it, they broke it, they used that to cook cornmeal and bread and provide for themselves in terms of nutrition and food.
[time=1968] And the oxen who threshed the grain according to Deuteronomy 25 were allowed to eat
[time=1974] the grain while they threshed it. They weren't to be muzzled, they were to be allowed to eat
[time=1980] what they were threshing. Paul's point is obvious.
[time=1985] God required that animals who labored to provide physical food for his people
[time=1991] were to be fed. How much more would he want faithful pastors and teachers
[time=1997] who provide spiritual food to their needy flock to be provided for as well?
[time=2004] The second quote, go back to Luke for the laborer is worthy of his wages.
[time=2010] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, go real quick, turn your Bible please to Luke chapter 10.
[time=2017] And let me just show you an interesting backdrop here.
[time=2021] Now after this, the Lord appointed 70 others. This is an interesting time in the ministry of our Lord.
[time=2026] Now he's expanding his reach. He basically commissions 70 more to go out
[time=2032] and to preach and teach the message of repentance, the great truth of the word.
[time=2038] Now after this, the Lord appointed 70 others and sent them in pairs ahead of him to every city and place where he himself was going to come.
[time=2047] And he was saying to them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
[time=2052] Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.
[time=2058] Go, behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves." Now watch this. "Carry no money belt, carry no bag, no shoes,
[time=2071] and greet no one on the way. No money, no bag, no shoes,
[time=2078] greet no one on the way." The greet no one on the way didn't mean they were rude.
[time=2083] Greeting someone on the way contextually, historically in that day, would have taken about two hours.
[time=2089] Greeting someone on the way was like a ceremony and the harvest was ready.
[time=2095] And there were people who were in spiritual need, so Jesus says, "Just go.
[time=2099] Just go. Don't do the two hour ceremony on the road."
[time=2105] Whatever house you enter, first say, "Peace be to this house.
[time=2110] If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him, but if not, it will return to you.
[time=2115] Stay in that house, eating and drinking what they give you."
[time=2121] You see that? What they give you for the laborer is worthy of his, what?
[time=2126] Say it, of his wages, of his wages. Generous, thoughtful, compensation for those who do the ministry of the Lord.
[time=2139] Something that Paul wanted to make sure was going on there at the church in Ephesus.
[time=2144] Something I am so thankful is going on and has gone on here.
[time=2149] Now let's get to our second part of the section. Let's finish up chapter 5.
[time=2153] Several important truths that all of us should be mindful of.
[time=2156] Look with me at verses 19 and 20.
[time=2160] It says in verses 19 and 20 back to 1 Timothy 5.
[time=2166] It says, "Do not receive Timothy. Do not receive an accusation against an elder."
[time=2174] Now we're talking about a situation where one in leadership maybe has done something wrong, something egregious, something sinful.
[time=2182] Maybe somebody comes to Timothy and wants to tell him about it.
[time=2187] And here immediately Paul sets in place the great respect of the office of elder.
[time=2194] And he says, "Timothy, be very careful with this.
[time=2197] Don't receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three, what? Gossips? Two or three, what? Say it.
[time=2205] Witnesses." So it's not second or third hand, you're to receive an accusation against an elder when it's what?
[time=2212] First hand, witnesses, two or three.
[time=2216] Those who, it gets interesting here, look at verse 20.
[time=2219] Those who continue and sin the sinning, unrepentant elder rebuke in the presence of who?
[time=2227] All so that the rest, that's all of you, will be fearful of what?
[time=2236] Of sinning.
[time=2238] Fearful of sinning. Here's our principle. Be both careful and bold.
[time=2244] Paul says to Timothy, "Be both careful and bold in dealing with sinning elders who will not repent."
[time=2253] Three things I want you just to write down on your sheet, okay, as it relates to this point.
[time=2257] Number one, elders are worthy of deep respect.
[time=2261] Elders are worthy of deep respect. I hope you sense that in the text.
[time=2265] I hope you understand that as we just read through those two verses.
[time=2268] There was a sense in Paul that if we're dealing with an elder, it was very important, always important to deal carefully.
[time=2273] But with an elder, it's two or three. It's not gossip.
[time=2277] It's first hand. Be very careful, Timothy, how you deal with this.
[time=2282] Elders worthy of deep respect.
[time=2285] The second thing I want to point out to you, and I want to spend a little bit of time talking about what you did this morning, is instilling fear.
[time=2292] Instilling fear is not always.
[time=2295] In fact, I would argue it's rarely a bad idea.
[time=2301] Now you read that passage, and I'll just say up front, you read that passage.
[time=2306] It doesn't sound very politically correct if I can say that.
[time=2312] Those who continue in sin rebuke in the presence of all, really?
[time=2318] Really.
[time=2320] Call them to account in the presence of all, it says,
[time=2327] "So that the rest also will be fearful of sinning."
[time=2333] Fearful of sinning. Paul wanted Timothy to handle it this way,
[time=2339] so that one of the end game products is so that those in the family, listen, would be fearful of sinning.
[time=2350] What does this mean? That you would be, as the unrepentant, hard, rebellious heart of another is brought to your attention.
[time=2365] He says he wants that to happen so that you will be afraid of sinning.
[time=2372] What does this fearful of sinning mean?
[time=2378] Does it mean fearful of the consequences?
[time=2383] Answer? You bet.
[time=2387] Do you all understand that there are consequences?
[time=2392] You need an answer on that one. Everybody understand that there are consequences to sinning,
[time=2402] and especially if we're talking about unrepentant sin.
[time=2406] It's one thing to sin and go, "Oh, wow, that's not who I want to be.
[time=2411] It's not where I want to go. God and whoever I've violated, please forgive me."
[time=2418] You with me? It's another thing to hang on to that sin.
[time=2422] It's another thing to stay stuck by your choice in that iniquity.
[time=2428] And with that comes consequences.
[time=2431] So where we talk about being fearful of sinning, does it mean fearful of consequences? Yes, it does.
[time=2438] But let's keep going. Does it mean fear of, and if we go back to this illustration that Paul gives to Matthew here,
[time=2444] also could it also mean fear of exposure? I mean, this guy just got exposed.
[time=2449] And could we deduce from that that there might be a fear in you of being exposed? Yes or no?
[time=2456] Absolutely. There comes the fear of consequence. There comes the fear of exposure.
[time=2463] My friends, there is the fear of loss. You say, "What loss?"
[time=2469] It's the loss that comes from consequences and exposure.
[time=2474] There is all of that. Elder, non-elder, follower of Christ.
[time=2482] These are some of the things I think that go into this picture of the people being afraid of sinning.
[time=2490] But mostly, and I want to make sure you hear this, mostly I think what this means, where it talks about allowing the family to see the effect of unrepentant sin
[time=2502] and them then being afraid of sinning. Mostly, I believe what's being communicated here
[time=2508] is that the people need to have a healthy fear of God.
[time=2513] A fear of God.
[time=2515] And I want to just say that to you because there are so many times I stand here and say to you, there are so many times we stand here and teach you about the mercy of God,
[time=2525] which is real, amen, about the goodness and grace of God, which is real, right?
[time=2532] So many times I stand and proclaim to you the gentleness and the love of our God who works with us
[time=2540] and builds us up and sustains us in our weakness.
[time=2545] And we're thankful for him and it feels good and we're appreciative and he's awesome.
[time=2551] And that's all true, but I want to just say to you as well because I've always done this with you.
[time=2558] Wherever we come to things in Scripture that might even seem to be contradictory.
[time=2565] It says this, but it says this, I've always told you, I believe both.
[time=2570] And I think the answer lies in the heartfelt communication of both
[time=2576] and the heartfelt reception on your part of both truths.
[time=2580] He is good. He is gracious. My friends, you should be afraid of him.
[time=2587] And some will say immediately what that means is a healthy reverence.
[time=2595] Yeah, yeah, sort of, but it also means you should be afraid.
[time=2603] Do you hear me? You should be afraid of a God whose commitment to purity and perfection and holiness
[time=2613] is so perfect and so right and so majestic that he doesn't put up with it.
[time=2622] And while you and I have been forgiven of ours, our sinfulness and our weaknesses and our failures, and while ultimately the great truth of the gospel is that Christ has saved us from his judgment, his eternal judgment.
[time=2637] Amen, thank God. In the day to day he will deal with you and he deals with me.
[time=2645] And there is a healthy sense where I want to honor him and I want to obey him
[time=2652] because I fear him.
[time=2655] And you see culture and political correctness has softened authority in our world.
[time=2664] And somehow authority should never be connotated with fear and it's just not biblical.
[time=2672] And it's also just, it's natural that we should think this way.
[time=2679] You know it and I know it.
[time=2681] When you and I come flying over a hill on 69, going 82, and once we come over the hill,
[time=2688] there is a police officer with one of those little guns sticking out his window.
[time=2692] Your first thought isn't, God bless that law enforcement officer.
[time=2699] I'm so thankful that he's there.
[time=2702] No, your first thought in mine is...
[time=2705] I won't say anything else.
[time=2708] Your first thought in mine is fear.
[time=2710] And here's what I want to make sure we understand.
[time=2712] Why are you fearful and I'm fearful when you see that guy?
[time=2715] Because you and I both know we're what?
[time=2717] Say it louder.
[time=2719] We're guilty.
[time=2722] And he's holy.
[time=2726] God, not the cop.
[time=2730] And so I want to just help us understand this.
[time=2734] It's not a wrong thing.
[time=2736] It's not unhealthy that believers would be fearful of a God who's holy.
[time=2741] And out of that fear want to honor him.
[time=2744] In parenting it's okay to have a sense of fear for a dad or a mom, not fear of being beaten,
[time=2753] not fear of being abused, not fear of being mistreated, but the fear that comes with authority
[time=2761] and knowing what happens when you break from that authority.
[time=2765] Psalm 31 says wisdom is found in the one who fears God.
[time=2771] Deuteronomy 4, God said, "Teach them to fear me so they'll live."
[time=2777] And Genesis 20, Abraham.
[time=2779] Remember Genesis 20, Abraham and Sarah, he comes to a Bimalak and he tells a Bimalak that Sarah is his what?
[time=2786] Sister, because he's afraid of a Bimalak.
[time=2788] And if you read Genesis 20, Abraham says that he's terrified of a Bimalak because he believed
[time=2795] that a Bimalak did not have a proper fear of who?
[time=2800] God.
[time=2802] Abraham knew that when you're dealing with someone who doesn't fear God, that's a bad deal.
[time=2811] Proverbs 10 says that a healthy fear of God prolongs life.
[time=2817] No kidding.
[time=2820] Ephesians 6, 5 says obedience is at times characterized by fear and trembling.
[time=2825] And Proverbs, all Proverbs says the fear of God is the beginning of what?
[time=2829] Say it, Church.
[time=2830] Wisdom.
[time=2831] Think about that.
[time=2832] The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.
[time=2835] Do you want to be wise?
[time=2836] Do you want to make good choices?
[time=2841] Do you want to live in a God-honoring way?
[time=2843] Do you want to possess wisdom?
[time=2846] Fear God.
[time=2848] And what that's saying is this, only those who come to the realization that you're not
[time=2855] God.
[time=2856] Only those who come to the realization that you're not that smart.
[time=2860] Only those who come to the realization that you on your own will fail.
[time=2866] Only those who humble themselves.
[time=2869] Fear God and see him as the ultimate source of truth and wisdom will ever possess wisdom
[time=2875] and ever experience prolonged life.
[time=2878] Blessing.
[time=2879] God's favor.
[time=2884] He says, bring the unrepentant elder.
[time=2886] He doesn't say how to do it.
[time=2888] He says, bring him to the people and use the unrepentant hard heart of one individual and
[time=2897] all that's going to come from that.
[time=2900] To remind the people, young and old, be afraid of sin.
[time=2907] Be very, very afraid.
[time=2910] Third point there, I'd say be careful and bold with anyone.
[time=2914] Yes, be careful and bold with elders.
[time=2917] Be careful and bold with anyone.
[time=2922] Look at verse 21 with me if you would.
[time=2926] Verse 21, I saw him, he charged you in the presence of God, Timothy, and of Christ Jesus and other angels to maintain these principles without bias, doing nothing in a spirit of what?
[time=2939] Partiality.
[time=2941] Partiality, we're still kind of dealing with the sinning unrepentant leader.
[time=2946] And Paul tells Timothy, listen, unrepentant elders are shown no favoritism.
[time=2953] There is no favoritism, my friends, when it comes to sin.
[time=2957] There is no partiality when it comes to unrepentants, no good old boy backroom deals.
[time=2964] Unrepentants and a stubborn commitment to stay in one's sin brings a price no matter who you are.
[time=2974] And if you're going to continue in it, it will be by God mostly dealt with.
[time=2981] Do you understand that?
[time=2985] Somebody here in the room this morning, somebody watching the broadcast, somebody listening online,
[time=2991] you may be today stuck, mostly by your own choice in a pattern of sin.
[time=3001] And if you continue in that pattern of sin, God will deal with you not because he hates you,
[time=3008] but because he what?
[time=3010] Say it louder, Church.
[time=3011] He loves you.
[time=3013] He will.
[time=3015] Listen, he will.
[time=3019] And so whether you're a sinning elder or whether you're a sinning follower of Christ,
[time=3025] one of the great takeaways from this really practically is whoever you are, it doesn't have to go that way.
[time=3030] Whoever you are, listen, repent.
[time=3037] Stop.
[time=3040] Just stop.
[time=3042] By the power and grace of God, with the help of the people of God, with the courage provided by the spirit of God, stop.
[time=3051] I read recently how repentance is, the picture of repentance is that picture that maybe many, I don't know,
[time=3057] maybe several of you, or many of you have had, where you're standing literally near a cliff, where you're on a hike, or you're up in the mountains with your family, or wherever you are, you're by a river bed.
[time=3067] It's that picture of you walking toward the edge, an edge that represents danger, and you're standing there on that edge,
[time=3075] and you literally feel the ground begin to what?
[time=3079] To shift.
[time=3081] You literally begin to feel that ground, it begins to slip away, and that first thought in your mind and mind is what?
[time=3089] Step a little further? No, the idea of repentance is, "Gosh, I've got to get out of here."
[time=3095] I've got to back this thing up.
[time=3099] Walk away from the edge.
[time=3103] What's your edge? Come on, be honest.
[time=3111] Be honest with him, here in this moment.
[time=3116] He's given you a chance to today identify that cliff.
[time=3122] You know what's over that thing, and he tells you here, this is going to go a certain way.
[time=3131] If you keep moving down that road, step away from that edge, ask for help, confess what needs to be confessed,
[time=3139] allow the Spirit of God and the grace of God and the people of God to come around you.
[time=3147] There is no favoritism, there is no partiality with sin.
[time=3155] Be slow to affirm one as an elder. Next point, verse 22, "Be slow to affirm one as an elder,
[time=3163] immaturity in leadership always." Anybody who's in leadership in this room knows this is true.
[time=3170] Immaturity in leadership always comes back to bite you. Look at verse 22, "Do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily, and thereby share responsibility for the what."
[time=3182] Say it for the sins of others, keep yourself free from this sin.
[time=3189] This is really important, we're not to affirm, we're not to appoint, we're not to bring to you elders to appoint elders.
[time=3196] And elders aren't to lay their hands on, if you will, as a symbol of affirmation, one who is too young.
[time=3203] With elders comes a seasoning of life and following Christ and serving others.
[time=3210] I hear it on the sports talk radio all the time, I read it in the sports sections.
[time=3216] Anybody who's ever been around sports, you and I both know that in the sports world, you'll oftentimes hear about how such and such an organization hired a new young coach.
[time=3226] And yes, they'll say he's young, but we're going to let him cut his teeth on this thing.
[time=3230] We're going to let him learn by taking a few hard knocks, probably some hard lessons, but one day he'll be better for it.
[time=3238] And I want to just say to you this morning that might work in the world of sports, it's not how it works in the church.
[time=3244] Elders aren't to cut their teeth on the failure of their immaturity, no elders are to appoint those who are seasoned, those who are mature.
[time=3255] It says in verse 23, Paul just moving through, looks like kind of a general list of things he wanted to make sure Timothy heard.
[time=3262] No longer drink water exclusively, Paul says to Timothy, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.
[time=3273] I didn't quite know how else to say this, but apparently the ox should mix in some or low with the grain.
[time=3279] It's kind of what that looks like there.
[time=3283] And before anybody gets too carried away or too excited about what that might mean for you, first of all, don't forget from the text here.
[time=3291] It's medicinal, clearly he's having Timothy drink the wine for his stomach, it's medicinal.
[time=3299] Don't forget operative word here is a little, right?
[time=3304] A little, shopping, cake, wine, TV, computer.
[time=3314] It's all okay when done in moderation, it's all okay until something begins to govern you.
[time=3320] It's all okay until something begins to run you, it's all okay until something masters you.
[time=3326] So it's medicinal, it's a little.
[time=3330] And the bottom line is he's telling Timothy too, so really it's just for me and not any of you, so we can forget about it.
[time=3337] Verse 24, verse 24, the sins of some will end with this.
[time=3343] The sins of some are quite evident going before them to judgment for others, their sins follow after.
[time=3349] Might seem confusing, but really what he's talking about there is the way that you process, the way that you assess, the way that you come alongside and appoint elders.
[time=3360] There are some as you look at that text.
[time=3362] There are some whose sins and what that means really is weaknesses, character flaws.
[time=3367] There are some who you just see right out of the gate, they're right there and they become evident right away.
[time=3372] Others who they're not going to become evident until you look.
[time=3376] But if you look, if you assess, if you have honest conversations, if you really engage with this guy and you're not trying to bust him, you're just trying to help him grow and develop.
[time=3387] And if that process is thorough, if that process is thorough and if we give time and effort to that, then time there will be things that come that allow you to see that maybe that guy's not quite ready.
[time=3399] And again, all that means is you get to work with him more and more in the days to come, to help him become ready.
[time=3407] Great truth from the Apostle Paul to Timothy.
[time=3410] Great truth for us to be mindful of today.
[time=3413] Let me ask if you would stand and let me pray for us as we close.
[time=3417] Our Father in Heaven, we're grateful for Your Word.
[time=3421] And oh God, we're grateful for the very practical, everyday, very real reminders that it gives us thankful for the truth that it teaches us.
[time=3431] And God, maybe more than anything, we're thankful today for the chance we have to respond to it.
[time=3437] Oh God, I pray that we would be a people who would be doers of this Word that we've heard today.
[time=3446] All that has been said, all that has been taught, God, apply it to those in this room in a thousand different ways and a thousand different lives and a thousand different scenarios.
[time=3457] God, please take the truth that God proclaimed today and in individual hearts in this room, bring it to bear.
[time=3466] Allow people to wrestle with it, allow questions to be asked, allow new patterns to be established.
[time=3473] Father, we're thankful for this family, all that You're doing in and through this place.
[time=3478] And we look forward to being together again soon, if that be Your will, in Your Son's name we pray.
[time=3485] And all the people agreed and said, Amen. God bless you. We'll see you next week.
