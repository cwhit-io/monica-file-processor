[time=34] It's great to be with you again.
[time=35] I want you to watch here just in a couple of minutes a video, it's a promotional video for this year's 2011 Global Leadership Summit.
[time=43] We have the privilege again to be partnering with the Willow Creek Association and Black Hawk's been hosting a satellite location for the leadership summit over the last six years and it is a two day event that you really don't want to miss.

[time=62] You need to go to our website and register, but I first of all want you to watch this and just be encouraged and inspired as you think about what you will encounter, who you will encounter and what your experience will be at this year's Leadership Summit.
[time=75] (upbeat music)
[time=119] (upbeat music) Some of the best leadership lessons I've ever learned have come from very unlikely candidates.
[time=129] - I think sometimes the difference between success and value is a very fine line.
[time=135] - What dream is waiting for you just on the other side of your fear?
[time=139] - How long do we keep stretching ourselves to do what doesn't think possible to do?
[time=145] - You don't need charisma to become a leader.
[time=147] Being a leader gives you charisma.
[time=150] - God has a great plan for your life.
[time=152] It starts when you do what God has given you to do right now.
[time=155] (upbeat music)
[time=177] (upbeat music) (keyboard clicking)

[time=264] I can't wait to experience all of it with you.
[time=267] God bless you.
[time=268] Thank you again for tuning in.
[time=269] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=271] - It's been about six weeks now that Corbin and I have learned about our little baby's condition.
[time=280] And can I tell you, I'm so thankful to be standing here in all my largeness to be honest church in the shock of those first 24 hours.
[time=294] I was ready to take my doctor's advice, to induce labor, terminating this pregnancy and in effect, ending her life on my terms.
[time=305] Thankfully, we serve a faithful God
[time=313] who did not let me stay in that mindset for long.
[time=319] For many prayers and wise counsel, he completely renewed my mind and overwhelmed me with this peace that surpasses all understanding.
[time=330] I no longer felt burdened, but felt like I had been given a gift.
[time=337] I gift of three more months.
[time=340] Three more months to hold
[time=346] and carry this precious life to term.
[time=349] And the scripture says to always be prepared
[time=355] to give an answer for the hope that you have.
[time=359] So I've had to ask myself, what is the hope that I have in the midst of the darkness?
[time=365] First, I have hope and is promised
[time=371] that I will spend eternity with Zoe.
[time=374] Sometimes it's hard to remember that this isn't it.
[time=379] We're living in the vapor.
[time=382] This is temporary.
[time=384] But for those who put their trust in the Lord,
[time=390] true life happens in the afterlife.
[time=394] I also have hope that he uses all things for good,
[time=402] like Romans 828 states.
[time=405] It has been so reassuring to me that nothing is wasted, including Zoe's short life.
[time=412] My pain and tears are wasted.
[time=415] I believe he is making it good in me and in my family's lives and maybe even for others around us.
[time=424] I have found comfort in the fact
[time=430] that God knows exactly how I feel.
[time=434] He had to give up his only son for a greater good.
[time=438] And on a much smaller scale, I wonder if he is asking me to do the same, to give up Zoe because he has a bigger picture in mind.
[time=448] And finally, I have hope in his promise that he will never leave me.
[time=460] He will never leave me or forsake me.
[time=462] He will never leave me or forsake me in each step of this pregnancy.
[time=470] He will never leave me or forsake me when it's time to go to the hospital and deliver her.
[time=477] He will not leave me or forsake me at her death.
[time=491] And he certainly will not leave me or forsake me in the days, months, and years to follow.
[time=500] Someone had a good word for me this week.
[time=506] I think it's very true.
[time=516] Christ doesn't necessarily replace the pain and the tears and the sorrow.
[time=525] It's not that I will just stop feeling deeply, but he promises his peace and comfort with it
[time=535] as he holds me through it.
[time=537] The next song that the choir is going to sing
[time=544] is all about the realities that we have through the great name of Jesus and what he did on the cross.
[time=551] A lot of these lyrics have hit close to home for me.
[time=556] Some of them being every fear has no place
[time=562] at the sound of your great name and all the weak find their strength at the sound of his great name.
[time=576] 2 Corinthians 1, 19 through 20 says, "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, "when we proclaim to mine you was not yes and no, "but in him is always yes.
[time=592] "For all the promises of God find their yes and him.
[time=598] "And I can't wait for the day when our whole family "is reunited and we get to bow "together to the name that is above every name, "the name of Jesus."
[time=612] [MUSIC - 261 seconds]
[time=889] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[time=919] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[time=949] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[time=978] I lift my eyes to the mountains.
[time=980] Where does my help come from?
[time=983] I lift my eyes to you, to you who sit and thrown in heaven.
[time=988] I keep my eyes always on the Lord.
[time=991] With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
[time=995] My eyes are ever on the Lord, for he will release me, my feet, from the snare.
[time=1001] Therefore, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles.
[time=1007] And let us run with perseverance, the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus.
[time=1014] Our God is a consuming fire, a burning holy flame with glory and freedom.
[time=1040] Our God is the only righteous judge, ruling over us with kindness and wisdom.
[time=1053] We will keep our eyes on you, we will keep our eyes on you.
[time=1069] Our mighty fortress is our God, a sacred refuge is your name.
[time=1082] Your kingdom is unshakable, with you forever we will win.
[time=1095] Our God is jealous for his own, none could comprehend his love and his mercy.
[time=1108] Our God is consulted on his throne, high above the heavens, forever he is worthy.
[time=1120] We will keep our eyes on you, we will keep our eyes on you.
[time=1135] Our mighty fortress is our God, a sacred refuge is your name.
[time=1148] Your kingdom is unshakable, with you forever we will win.
[time=1163] We will win you forever we will win.
[time=1193] We will keep our eyes on you, we can set our hearts down.
[time=1206] Our kingdom is our God, a sacred refuge is your name.
[time=1233] We will keep our eyes on you, we will keep our eyes on you.
[time=1252] Our mighty fortress is our God, a sacred refuge is your name.
[time=1265] We will keep our eyes on you, we will keep our eyes on you.
[time=1281] Our God is our consuming fire, a burning holy flame with glory and freedom.
[time=1302] A lot of work and time and effort put in by our choir and band to bless us this morning.
[time=1316] What they leave, awesome.
[time=1328] There may be some I don't know in the room, don't know exactly where you come from or
[time=1334] what you're accustomed to, it's okay.
[time=1336] We all come from different places, the level of transparency and openness, evidence this
[time=1343] morning, we have it often and it takes different shapes and forms but Corbin and Tanya sharing
[time=1351] with you the ongoing journey that they've been on with God as he's allowed to this point
[time=1358] at least it looks as if their little one Zoe has no brain and she'll be delivered here hopefully in the middle of July and as they continue to submit themselves to God and
[time=1369] His will as they continue to pray for God to do a miracle if that would be God's will,
[time=1375] we continue to join them in those prayers and we don't shy away around here from dealing
[time=1383] head on with the realities that God allows.
[time=1386] We believe it gives us an opportunity to make much of Him, to grow in our trust and our
[time=1393] faith in Him and to model that for an on looking world who at times encounters the things we
[time=1400] encounter and shakes their head and disbelief and have nowhere to turn and nowhere to go
[time=1406] and no way to make sense of it so we try our best to lean on Him and sometimes we do that
[time=1414] privately and sometimes we do that publicly and I hope you've been encouraged this morning.
[time=1420] In your Bibles if you would to 1 Timothy chapter 6, would you do that 1 Timothy chapter 6?
[time=1426] We make our way this morning to the final chapter in this study that we've been in for several months.
[time=1432] I want to thank you, many of you contacted me and let me know that you had taken me up on the invite to read chapter 6 each day and I just can't tell you how encouraging that was.
[time=1443] I've invited all of you that call Black Hawk home to join me in reading through the chapter.
[time=1447] It's a phenomenal chapter filled with great truth and our hope and our prayer was that
[time=1453] as we read it often during the week God would use that reading to prepare our hearts and minds for what He'll have for us as we teach through it on Sunday morning and so to those
[time=1464] of you who read it with me, thanks to those of you who didn't want to jump in with us this week and just commit to once or twice a day, just sit down and read through this
[time=1474] chapter.
[time=1475] Let me ask you a question, let me ask you a few questions this morning as we come to this teaching.
[time=1480] How do you feel about your job these days?
[time=1485] Seriously, how do you feel about your job, where you work?
[time=1492] Whatever that is, whatever that entails, how do you feel about your job?
[time=1497] You love it, you love your job, do you hate it, do you dread it, do you look forward to
[time=1504] being there tomorrow morning at whatever time you'll show up?
[time=1508] How do you feel today about your job and what it entails and what it's like and where
[time=1515] you're at in that whole process?
[time=1518] Second question, what's your conduct like at work?
[time=1523] Really, seriously, how do you act at work?
[time=1531] If we could just somehow put a camera on you, put a camera that just videotapes every moment,
[time=1540] every interaction, every second of every day at work, where you go, what you do, how you
[time=1546] do it, maybe even somehow contraption on your mind that lets us see on the screen what you're
[time=1553] thinking.
[time=1555] How would that be?
[time=1558] How would your conduct like at work?
[time=1562] How do you feel about your job?
[time=1565] Here's a third question, how do you feel about your boss?
[time=1570] What kinds of thoughts do you have?
[time=1572] What kinds of pictures come across your mind when you think of him or her or them right
[time=1579] now?
[time=1580] How do you feel about your boss, your employer?
[time=1584] How do you feel about your job, what's your conduct like at work?
[time=1588] What are your thoughts regarding the one whose authority you're under?
[time=1593] And here's one for you, how's your conduct toward him?
[time=1596] What's your conduct like toward her?
[time=1600] What do you say about him?
[time=1603] What do you say about her when him or her aren't around?
[time=1608] What do you think about them as you interact with him or her?
[time=1614] What's your spirit like?
[time=1615] What's your attitude like toward the one whose authority you're under?
[time=1621] And then lastly, do you think any of the above questions really matter?
[time=1626] Maybe you're just sitting here this morning going, come on, I go to work, okay, what's the big deal?
[time=1631] I got a boss.
[time=1633] I'm here at church actually trying to get away from all that, Kelly, why are you bringing this up?
[time=1638] Well, we live in a society, my friends, today that struggles.
[time=1643] Struggles significantly with its approach toward and its attitude toward work.
[time=1649] A recent survey showed that over 70% of Americans don't like their jobs at all, strong dislike,
[time=1657] don't like going to work at all, and of the 70%, 90% said truth be told, they struggle
[time=1663] consistently getting out of bed in the morning to go and do that job.
[time=1670] Sadly, sadly, most people in our country view their jobs and their bosses as necessary
[time=1677] evils that they must endure in an effort to finance their materialism, personal indulgences,
[time=1686] and growing appetites.
[time=1688] You know what the tragedy of it all is, the tragedy is that some of these unhappy, bitter,
[time=1696] frustrated, short-tempered, get their late, try to leave early workers are followers of
[time=1706] Jesus Christ.
[time=1710] That's the tragedy.
[time=1712] One, sit here on Sunday morning and then go to that job on Monday.
[time=1720] And whether it's a boss at work who seems or is unreasonable, a coach who pushes hard
[time=1728] and whose tactics aren't appreciated, a teacher who demands a lot from you, I believe my friends,
[time=1735] I believe Christians today need to be reminded of what God in his word requires of his people
[time=1741] as they work under the authority of others.
[time=1746] I think it is a perfect time for you and I to be reminded of this.
[time=1750] Christians today need to be reminded of what God in his word requires of his people, all
[time=1756] of us as we work under the authority of others.
[time=1760] There really is, for some of you this is not new news, for others of you it might be.
[time=1764] There really is a biblical theology, a biblical foundation if you will of work.
[time=1772] Your work and how you approach it really is a spiritual issue, it's a spiritual matter.
[time=1781] And there really is a lot at stake and I want to show you that this morning.
[time=1786] I want you to sense that today, I want you to see that.
[time=1790] There's a great deal at stake, how you work and how you treat and conduct yourself with
[time=1796] those you work for does impact.
[time=1799] One way or the other, the kingdom of God.
[time=1803] It matters, my friends and the stakes are really high.
[time=1806] Let's just look briefly at that foundation that I mentioned, that theology of work if
[time=1812] you will.
[time=1813] If you wanted to kind of build that theology of work, you'd start in Genesis 2, you can look there if you'd like.
[time=1819] Genesis 2, verse 15 says, read it there, it says, "Then the Lord God took the man."
[time=1826] This is Adam, this is at the beginning of it all, my friends, "Then the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to swing on a hammock and sip a fruit drink."
[time=1838] Is that what it says?
[time=1842] No, that's sometimes the picture though that we kind of have.
[time=1845] We think, gosh, it was Adam, it's the garden.
[time=1848] There's no sin.
[time=1849] What life must have been like in the garden?
[time=1853] Well, what life was like in the garden is that God put man to work.
[time=1860] And I want you to think about this with me.
[time=1864] He put him into the garden to cultivate it and keep it.
[time=1868] In the garden before the fall, man was assigned work.
[time=1872] Therefore, isn't a result of the curse, but work is God's creative, good design for the
[time=1879] fulfillment of man.
[time=1880] I'll say that one more time.
[time=1882] Work therefore isn't a result of the curse, it's not because of sin, it's not because of the fall, but of God's creative, good design for the ultimate fulfillment of man.
[time=1895] Someone once said, "For the believer work is a sacred duty." You see, a Christian sees everything, or let me say it this way, a Christian should see everything he does in reference to his relationship to God.
[time=1911] Did you hear that?
[time=1912] There is no aspect of life or conduct, however apparently insignificant, which should not
[time=1918] be directed to the glory of God.
[time=1921] No one stressed the sacredness of all work more than the great reformer, Martin Luther
[time=1927] himself, who said, "To call popes, bishops, priests, monks, and nuns the religious class."
[time=1936] But to call princes, lords, artisans, and farm workers, the secular class is a spacious device, means it's not good, it's not how God designed it.
[time=1946] For all Christians, whatsoever really and truly belong to the religious class, and there is no difference among them, except in so far as they do different work, hence we deduce
[time=1958] that there is at bottom really no other difference between laymen, priests, princes, bishops,
[time=1965] or between religious and secular, all have spiritual status, every one of us in this
[time=1972] room this morning, no matter who you are, where you work, what you do, all have spiritual
[time=1980] status, and all are truly what, say it, church, priests, bishops, and popes.
[time=1989] I want you to understand this this morning.
[time=1990] My friends, every legitimate job has intrinsic value.
[time=1995] Do you understand this?
[time=1998] Every single job has intrinsic value.
[time=2002] Why?
[time=2003] Because it is the arena in which believers live out their Christian lives.
[time=2008] Thus Christianity, one man said, thus Christianity either fails or survives in triumphs in the
[time=2015] crucible of your real world.
[time=2018] Believers most commonly interact with that real world and the workplace as they live out their faith on their jobs.
[time=2027] They are to be a city set on a hill.
[time=2030] Matthew 5, 14, Christians must be concerned that their conduct on the job shows others
[time=2039] the power of Jesus Christ to transform a life.
[time=2045] Stakes are huge.
[time=2049] Believers work performance will bring either praise or blasphemy.
[time=2052] Your work performance will bring either praise or blasphemy to the name of God.
[time=2059] All work, whether directly or indirectly, is to advance God's kingdom.
[time=2066] Even those early Christians who were slaves, many who found themselves in the church in the early days of the church were indentured servants.
[time=2074] They were folks who lived under the rule of masters.
[time=2077] Even those early Christians who were slaves could glorify God by faithfully fulfilling
[time=2084] their duties at work.
[time=2087] And I want you to just think about this for a moment and I want you to just be reminded of the significance of the impact you get to have.
[time=2099] If you go to work, if you go to work every day, if you work on a factory floor, if you work on a sales force, if you work in a school teaching, I mean just think about this for
[time=2110] a moment.
[time=2111] If you go work at a job every day with all the folks you work with, in the company you work for, whatever arena that is, who has more impact?
[time=2122] Who has more opportunity for influence with those out in the everyday world of this culture
[time=2130] we live in?
[time=2131] Who really gets the chance to have more impact?
[time=2135] You or me?
[time=2137] It's interesting, sometimes I think you look at me and think, man, you're the guy who gets
[time=2144] to have all the impact.
[time=2146] I mean, you're on TV and church this size and all the people you must know.
[time=2154] You know what?
[time=2155] I try to work at this, but the truth is I spend most of my days with the already convinced.
[time=2163] Who gets to rub shoulders with those who aren't?
[time=2168] Who gets to punch in and punch out with those who desperately need to have the gospel validated
[time=2177] by the way you live?
[time=2178] Who is it?
[time=2179] In this room who really gets more of an opportunity, you or me, you, you get a huge one.
[time=2189] You get it every day and my hope, our desire is to teach you and equip you so that you can do the work of ministry, to impact a lost and dying world with the validity and the
[time=2202] substance of the truth embraced by you and lived out by you, something that you've got
[time=2208] to think about.
[time=2209] Let's look at what it says in our text this morning.
[time=2211] Look at 1 Timothy, chapter 6, verses 1 and 2, and would you just in honor of God's Word would you stand and let me read this to you?
[time=2220] Thank you.
[time=2221] It says all who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of
[time=2229] all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will not be spoken against.
[time=2237] Those who have believers as their masters, that phrase right there just offsets verse
[time=2243] 1 from verse 2.
[time=2244] If verse 2 is talking about those who have believers as their masters, then what we'll see is verse 1 is talking about those who would have unbelievers as masters, verse
[time=2255] 2, those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brothers but must serve them all the more because those who partake of the benefit
[time=2267] are believers and beloved.
[time=2269] Teach.
[time=2270] He's writing to Timothy, Timothy, teach and preach these principles.
[time=2276] Our Father in Heaven this morning, that is my desire.
[time=2279] It is our desire as leadership here at Black Hawk to do our very best with your help to
[time=2285] teach, to inform the mind as we think back to last week's message.
[time=2292] Oh, God, we want to teach these principles.
[time=2296] We want to explain these things in a way, God, where mentally these things can be grasped
[time=2302] and practiced and we also want to preach these principles.
[time=2306] God, we need to be stirred in our hearts this morning.
[time=2310] We need to be inspired by the implication of your truth and so God help me this morning
[time=2317] and those who receive this.
[time=2320] We pray that it would be teaching and preaching that would allow us to be doers and not just
[time=2326] hearers of your word in your son's name, we pray, amen, you can be seated.
[time=2332] Well, look with me back in verse one, all who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard
[time=2340] their own masters as worthy of all honor.
[time=2344] Our text uses the word slave.
[time=2348] You see it right there.
[time=2350] Our text uses the word slave and it paints the picture of slaves and masters, which I know
[time=2358] and fully realize is a word slave that for all of us in our day and culture carries with
[time=2365] an enormous negative implications.
[time=2370] What I want you to understand is that here in the New Testament culture, when this is written, long before the African slave trading business in the 1800s or the global sex slave
[time=2384] trafficking of minors in today's culture, before any of that this word slave simply
[time=2390] meant, and I quote, "any person who lived and functioned under the authoritative rule
[time=2397] of another." It's a long history here, but I want to just tell you this, slaves and masters in Ephesus
[time=2404] slaves and masters in the Roman culture of that day more closely resembled the relationship
[time=2410] we know today between employers and employees, okay?
[time=2415] That would be the most common picture.
[time=2418] It more resembled that than it did some of the pictures that you and I might conjure up when we think of slaves and masters, and while there were most certainly some God-honoring
[time=2429] employers or masters, there were clearly many others, many other employers and masters who
[time=2438] were evil, who were harsh, who were unfair, who were unreasonable, who were difficult to
[time=2445] live and work under, and thus the great challenge for believing slaves who are to, there you
[time=2452] see it, are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor.
[time=2457] What does it mean to regard them as worthy of all honor?
[time=2462] It means to lift them up.
[time=2463] It means to make much of them.
[time=2465] It means to obey them.
[time=2466] It means to do all of that in a way that speaks of one's submission and willingness to follow.
[time=2478] Slaves, employees are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor.
[time=2483] Now, here's where this gets really interesting.
[time=2486] I want you to look in your Bibles or look on the screen with me at Galatians 1.10.
[time=2492] Turn to Galatians, Paul, writing to the church at Galatia, addressing the same issue, and
[time=2498] it says in Galatians 1.10, "For I am now, for am I now seeking the favor of men or of
[time=2504] God?" Paul asks, "Am I striving to please men?" And he says this phrase, "It's great.
[time=2510] If I were still trying to please men, I would not be what in fact he was, which was a bond
[time=2517] servant of Christ." Paul refers to himself here in Galatians 1.10 as a bond servant translated.
[time=2528] It means a bond slave.
[time=2530] He refers to himself here as a slave of Christ.
[time=2536] This is the terminology.
[time=2539] These are the words that he uses.
[time=2542] Look at 2 Timothy 2.
[time=2544] Turn there, would you?
[time=2545] Look with me at 2 Timothy 2, verse 24.
[time=2549] Here now, Paul back in his writings to Timothy, pastoring the church at Ephesus, trying to help Timothy understand how he is to function as a leader.
[time=2558] And he reminds Timothy in verse 24, 2nd chapter, "The Lord's bond servant."
[time=2564] Timothy, that's you, you are a bond servant, and as such, you must not be quarrelsome,
[time=2572] but you must be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged.
[time=2579] Because as a slave, Timothy, you're going to be wronged.
[time=2586] Here he refers to Timothy as a bond slave.
[time=2588] Paul sees himself as a slave of Christ.
[time=2592] He calls Timothy a bond servant, a slave here, trying to honor God in the ministry.
[time=2597] Look at 1 Peter 2.
[time=2599] Would you write that down?
[time=2600] I hope you'll write all these down.
[time=2603] Come back and look at them even later.
[time=2605] But look this morning with me quickly at 1 Peter 2.16.
[time=2609] It says here as Peter writes to the church at large, trying to help the church understand how they should live, act as free men, Peter says.
[time=2618] And do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use that freedom as bond slaves
[time=2627] of God.
[time=2628] Peter reminds the church that they are, in essence, they are, in fact, slaves.
[time=2635] This is our relationship with God.
[time=2638] We live under the authority of another.
[time=2643] Believers live under the reign and rule of God.
[time=2647] We are under.
[time=2649] We are with a mindset of complete submission.
[time=2654] Understanding that we have no rights, that understand that all we live to do is serve
[time=2660] and honor and please the one who leads us.
[time=2665] And here's the deal.
[time=2666] When I describe all of this, and if the players in my description are God and you and me,
[time=2673] think, hey, that makes a lot of sense, we're submissive to him, he's God, he's our ruler,
[time=2680] he reigns and we come under him and where he says go, we go and what he says do, we do.
[time=2687] We're all good with it because it's God and it's us.
[time=2695] But the head scratcher is this one.
[time=2700] The head scratcher for many of us is that the exact same words are used to describe the
[time=2708] way in which you should honor your boss.
[time=2712] He doesn't change the words, he doesn't change the principles, he doesn't go to a different
[time=2719] Greek word, no.
[time=2722] Say God and your boss, get the same treatment.
[time=2732] That's what it says.
[time=2733] You say really?
[time=2734] I say, yeah, look at Ephesians 6.
[time=2736] Turn there, would you?
[time=2737] Go to Ephesians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, go to Ephesians 6 and let me read to you what
[time=2744] it says here about the way you're supposed to treat your boss being the same way you're
[time=2751] supposed to treat God.
[time=2754] If you're a boss in the room today, you're feeling kind of good right now.
[time=2760] Says in verse 5, "Slaves, employees, be obedient to those who are your bosses, to those who
[time=2768] are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling do this, in the sincerity
[time=2776] of your heart do this, employees, be obedient to those who exercise authority over you."
[time=2784] It says in essence, as to last three words of the verse, as to Christ.
[time=2793] And don't do this by way of eye service as men pleasers, but as slaves of Christ doing
[time=2800] the will of God from the heart, from the heart, employees, be obedient to those who are your
[time=2809] employers according to the flesh, with fear and trembling in the sincerity of your heart as to Christ.
[time=2816] Look at verse 7 with good will, render service as to the Lord and not to whoever He is, whoever
[time=2828] She is, whoever they are, no, no, no, you render good will with good will, render service
[time=2837] as to the Lord, not to them, knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this He
[time=2844] will receive back from the Lord, whether you're slave or free, amen, to serve and honor one's
[time=2854] employer well, please don't miss this, is to serve and honor Christ well.
[time=2865] So whoever you are, wherever you work, whatever authority you're under in the day to day of
[time=2874] this world, honor them well because the degree to which you do that well is the degree to
[time=2881] which you honor Christ, which takes us to the end of verse 1 and the main, don't miss this,
[time=2888] the main reason I believe behind the exhortation in the first place.
[time=2892] Why is all of this so important that you would honor your boss in the way in which you would honor Christ?
[time=2898] Why is it so important that there be such integrity in the way you work and the way you treat those you work for?
[time=2907] Well look at the second part of verse 1, so that, I love this, so that the name of God back to 1 Timothy 6, so that the name of God and our doctrine will not be spoken against.
[time=2922] Do you understand that?
[time=2925] Do you understand what that's saying?
[time=2928] In real, clear language, the Scriptures are exhorting you this morning to be a great employee,
[time=2935] to be a great employee and show the utmost in honor and respect to those you are under
[time=2941] because if you don't, the Scripture says the name of God and his doctrine, it means
[time=2948] his message.
[time=2951] If you don't, the name of God and God's message become tainted and tarnished.
[time=2958] You say wait a minute, what message?
[time=2961] What message of God is getting tainted or tarnished if I don't work well or honor those I work
[time=2968] for?
[time=2969] Well, here's just three things that represent this message that's at stake.
[time=2978] The message, my friends, of Christianity, the message of biblical Christianity is that
[time=2985] number one, the gospel transforms people.
[time=2990] You say in your workplace, I'm a believer, you raise your hand in essence and you declare
[time=2996] faithfulness to the Lord.
[time=2999] You call yourself a follower of Jesus Christ and you go into that job, well, whether you
[time=3005] realize it or not, they have a presupposition.
[time=3009] They have this idea that, wait a minute, I think those people, they're saying this to themselves.
[time=3014] People are supposed to be like changed and different.
[time=3020] The gospel claims to transform people and so are you working that way?
[time=3030] The message states that people who follow him are gracious.
[time=3036] The message of God states that people who follow him are loving and respectful and honest
[time=3044] and when you are honest and gracious and respectful, you make much of his name and you validate
[time=3051] his message when you don't, it's tainted and tarnished.
[time=3056] The message states that followers of Christ are unique, inherent in the biblical message
[time=3064] my friends is that followers of Christ are uncommon.
[time=3068] They are not like everybody else and when you work hard for an employer, a coach, a teacher
[time=3077] and you do it with great discipline and diligence and respect and honor, God and his message
[time=3084] are made much of, God and his message are validated.
[time=3090] When you screw around on the job, when you underachieve, when you disrespect authority,
[time=3097] when you cut corners and give a less than 110 percent effort, you turn God and his message
[time=3103] into a joke that gets mocked in break rooms along with you because then you're not special,
[time=3116] then you're not unique and your work isn't special and then in their minds God's not.
[time=3125] How's that for a little weight of responsibility on who, me?
[time=3132] Yeah, well get to me in a second, I'm more verse two.
[time=3137] I work for believers.
[time=3140] How about for those of you who work for those who don't claim to follow Christ?
[time=3144] How about for those of you in the room who are coached by or taught by or you work for
[time=3152] those who are far from God?
[time=3155] This puts an enormous amount of weight and responsibility on you to live out your faith
[time=3164] and to live it loud and to live it real and to be gracious and to honor those you work
[time=3171] for.
[time=3174] This week at work, here's just a few things I want you to keep in mind as simple as this is what I'm about to tell you.
[time=3182] I probably had a dozen people after first hour ago, you've got to be kidding me.
[time=3189] I can't.
[time=3190] I don't know if I can do this.
[time=3192] Here are the three things they said, this week at work, do a better job, okay?
[time=3198] Let's just start there.
[time=3200] This week at work, whoever you are, whatever it is you do because you're doing your work not for your organization, not for your boss, but now the scripture teaches us that we're doing our work for God.
[time=3211] Do it better than you've ever done it.
[time=3214] Get better this week.
[time=3216] Do something.
[time=3217] Do anything.
[time=3218] To improve the effort that you bring and the contribution that you make in that setting.
[time=3224] Do a better job this week and honor God in the midst of that.
[time=3230] Secondly, pray daily while you're reading 1 Timothy 6 with me daily.
[time=3235] Now I'm going to ask you to pray daily for your boss.
[time=3239] We had some folks first hour just go, oh no, please no, don't say that take that back,
[time=3249] rewind the tape, edit that out, no, pray for your boss.
[time=3256] Pray for him.
[time=3257] Pray for her.
[time=3259] Pray that God would be at work in their lives somehow.
[time=3262] Pray that somehow they might see in you, not rebelliousness and indignant behavior or
[time=3269] district.
[time=3270] No, pray that they'd see in you, you're doing what you can with God's help to honor them.
[time=3275] Pray for their families, pray for their personal situations, pray for anything.
[time=3280] Do a better job this week and pray daily for your boss and thirdly, don't you do or say anything.
[time=3287] Commit to do this.
[time=3288] Stay or do anything that would dishonor him or her.
[time=3293] Don't do or say anything to anybody, no matter how private it is, no matter how trusted they
[time=3300] are, you know they'd never say it to anyone, no, just don't do or say anything about your
[time=3306] boss that would in any way be dishonoring.
[time=3310] Now, look at verse 2, "For those who work for and are under the authority of believers,"
[time=3320] well, it isn't life easy for you all the time.
[time=3324] No, you know that's not true.
[time=3327] Those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful either because they are brothers, they are brothers in the faith.
[time=3338] You must serve them all the more.
[time=3341] You got a believer?
[time=3343] For a boss, sometimes when you have a believer, a Christian who is your authority, sometimes
[time=3351] this weird thinking kicks in and you think somehow because he's a believer or she's a believer, you somehow get a pass.
[time=3359] No, no, this says honor them that you got a believer as a boss, honor him or her even more so because they're brothers and you love them because they share in the benefit.
[time=3372] Do you see that?
[time=3375] But you must serve them all the more because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved, teach and preach these principles.
[time=3386] My hope and my prayer for every one of you in this room who in any way, shape or form
[time=3393] will find yourself tomorrow morning under the authority of someone else.
[time=3399] My hope is that you will do that in a way that honors him or her, that you will do it
[time=3405] in a way whereby that God is honored, that you'll do it in a way that makes much of them,
[time=3414] God and your employer and wherever that gets dicey, wherever that gets tough, wherever that gets difficult then that's when you and I are to go to our knees and ask God, beg
[time=3427] God, to help give us the courage and the grace and the maturity and the trust needed
[time=3434] to work in this world the way God designed us to work, hard and respectful.
[time=3442] Amen?
[time=3443] Let's stand and pray.
[time=3446] Father in heaven, we're grateful for the morning, blessed and blown away by the message that
[time=3453] we've heard in our worship and even in our teaching time, thankful God for the way that
[time=3459] you and your word instruct us, thankful Father for the practicality of it all and we know
[time=3466] it is deep truth but we also know God that it gets lived out in the everyday of our lives.
