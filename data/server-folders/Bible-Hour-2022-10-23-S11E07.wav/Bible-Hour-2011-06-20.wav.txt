[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] I'm thankful that you're watching today.
[time=36] And as you watch this, we're celebrating today Father's Day.
[time=40] And I wanna just say a special word of congratulations and thanks and encouragement to those of you who are watching today and you are dads.
[time=50] You've got little ones or you've got middle of the road ones or you've got older ones either way.
[time=56] God has given you a very special place of influence.
[time=59] God has given you a special spot in their lives.
[time=62] And I think really, and you'll hear more about this today, I think really a dad may be the most influential person on the face of the earth.
[time=70] And I mean that.
[time=71] I think a father and what he can do and what he can invest or what he misses, what he doesn't invest.
[time=80] I think that's one of the most significant, one of the most strategic, one of the most important relationships that exists and that is the relationship between a father and his children.
[time=91] And so I hope as you watch this message today, it's not meant to be a slap on the wrist.
[time=97] It's not meant to be anything other than an encouragement to you as a father to keep in mind and to have it at the forefront of your life, this great calling that God has placed on you as a dad to make an investment in those that he has given you to care for.
[time=114] And I realize as you watch this, you may be a dad and your circumstance, there could be a number of circumstances that you're in.
[time=122] You could be in a lot of trouble.
[time=124] You could be in a great place in your life today.
[time=127] There could be all kinds of challenges that you're coming up against.
[time=132] I want you to know no matter who you are, no matter where you've been, no matter what your circumstance as a dad today, I believe God's designed for you as a dad.
[time=142] I believe God's will for you.
[time=144] I believe what God desires for you as a dad can come through in the midst of whatever it is you're living in.
[time=151] And so watch today, please be encouraged.
[time=153] And remember this, remember this, as a dad, if you're wanting to have any kind of positive, lasting God honoring impact with your children, you must be, you have to be in a growing
[time=171] and thriving relationship with God who gives you the strength, who gives you the love, who gives you the wisdom to be the dad he called you to be.
[time=182] And so we wanna be a place.
[time=183] I wanna be a pastor and friend to you.
[time=186] We wanna be a family here at Blackhawk to you.
[time=189] We wanna be a place where you can come and be grown in your faith and your love for him so that you can be the dad that he called you to be.
[time=198] And so as always, our doors are open and you can contact us, you can come and worship with us.
[time=205] We'd love to encourage you in the days to come.
[time=207] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=209] And God bless you as you watch the message today.
[time=212] (gentle music)
[time=231] [MUSIC - 254 seconds]
[time=491] (audience applauds)
[time=511] - Yeah, if you've ever felt the embrace of God, if you've ever run into his arms and sensed his great love and care, say amen.
[time=518] Amen, you can have a seat this morning.
[time=520] Like I said earlier, it's so good to see all of you were thankful that you're here today and looking forward to the time that God has for us, it's Father's Day, and we've got some things to say, some words of encouragement, hopefully some words of direction, God's words, for you dads in the room this morning.
[time=541] Speaking of running to his arms, I wanna just say this before we start this morning, many of you, so many of you, in the Blackhawk family have been praying for and doing your very best to encourage and come alongside our worship pastor, Corbin Miller and his family, his wife, Tanya, and their girls, most of you know that it was about
[time=568] eight weeks ago that in the midst of a, kind of a routine ultrasound they discovered that the little baby girl, Zoe Hope Miller, they found out that she had no brain and it was a hard realization, a tough discovery, but they, like you and I would expect from them, they did their very best with God's help to kind of take that in and process that and they just began then a journey toward delivery, which was going to be kind of mid to late July, and as they walked that road, they were running to his arms and he was faithful.
[time=611] That run kind of turned into a sprint toward him this week, and some of you may know, others of you may not, but again, at another ultrasound early in the week, it was discovered that Zoe had passed away and that she had probably passed away maybe a week or so before, and so what was being anticipated for July kind of happened just like that, and so it was Friday night that Tanya delivered Zoe and they were able to spend some time with her and boy, a lot involved there, but just a suffice to say that God was really gracious to them in the midst of that and they were able to mourn and celebrate all at the same time and your prayers and your thoughtfulness and your kindness is much appreciated.
[time=668] I know to them and to their family and please continue to pray for them.
[time=673] In fact, let's just pray for them now.
[time=675] Can we do that?
[time=676] Our father in heaven, we're grateful for the way that you in your goodness
[time=688] and your sovereignty got a providence an overseeing of everything that ever happens.
[time=698] God, you're perfect in that, and so we just pray today that where we question or just where we hurt in the midst of you, working out your plan, we pray for Corbin and for Tanya, for their family, for their families, for those who walk and live so closely with them, we lift all of them up today, and ask God that you would be what the Scripture says, the God of comfort, God of peace, the God of healing, and the God of grace, and we ask God in the days to come that as you heal their hearts and as you renew their strength, God, I pray that their story, that their journey and all that they and we have experienced would be allowed to be carried forward in a way whereby God, we could make much of you.
[time=750] We love you, we trust you still, we look forward to what you'll show us through this tomorrow, next week, next month, next year.
[time=760] However, that works out.
[time=762] Oh, God, be with our friends, allow them to sense and know of our great love and care for them and to those of us who are able to be here tomorrow morning, we just pray it would be a sweet time of reflection and remembering you and who you are.
[time=777] And thank you for a little Zoe.
[time=780] Thank you for her life.
[time=783] Thank you for what she taught us.
[time=785] Thank you for all that you will do in us because of the privilege of giving us of walking this road together and all the people in the room agreed and said, "Amen." Well, happy Father's Day, dads.
[time=800] I know there are many of you in the room.
[time=802] Father's Day is, as you know, a special day.
[time=806] I know it's maybe even complicated in some ways.
[time=809] For some, I know that beyond the complications, though, the intent here is that it would be a special day.
[time=816] Set aside to honor and express gratitude to our dads, it's a chance to thank him.
[time=822] Dads, it's a chance to thank you for the investment of life and love that you have made into the lives of your children.
[time=831] It is a chance to thank him for the Father he has been through all that you have faced as a son or a daughter, through all that you have encountered, through all that you have endured, you get to thank him today for the Father he has been.
[time=848] Dads, it's a day set aside to make a really big deal about all that you do as a dad.
[time=856] And I want to say that to you again.
[time=860] This is a great day.
[time=861] A celebration within which we get to celebrate and make much of all everything that you do as a dad.
[time=875] It's a big deal.
[time=876] And so here's a good question to ask dads on a day like this.
[time=880] Dads, what is it that you actually do as a dad?
[time=885] What is it, dads, as you think about it and ponder it this morning, what is it that you actually do in your role as a father?
[time=898] You, just you thinking this through this morning, honestly, openly before God.
[time=907] What is it that you do?
[time=910] We get to celebrate it all today and I want you to ask yourself before God and maybe your family today, what is it that you do?
[time=918] What investment are you making?
[time=921] You hear that term used a lot, I use that word a lot.
[time=925] And aside from the financial implication of it, what investment are you making?
[time=930] What do we mean by that?
[time=931] Investment, investment is what is it that you're, what is it that you're depositing into them?
[time=941] What is it that you're depositing into your two-year-old, into your eight-year-old, into your 17-year-old, into your 40-year-old?
[time=949] What are you, we've used this phrase before too, what are you passing along, priests, the priesthood of God, the priests are those who pass along, the character and attributes of God to his people.
[time=962] Dad's as priests this morning, what are you investing into them?
[time=965] What are you depositing into their hearts and lives?
[time=969] What are you passing along?
[time=971] You're passing along temper, you're passing along.
[time=974] Excuse making, are you passing along laziness or are you passing along sacrificial love for your wife and for them as your kids, are you passing along?
[time=987] Patience, are you passing along your own clear personal pursuit of God?
[time=993] These are the kinds of things we mean when we talk about what investment are you making?
[time=999] What kind of father have you been?
[time=1001] And I want to just take this idea of investment and the opportunity God gives you as a dad to invest in your kids, I want to take this concept and just kind of drill down into that this morning, spend some time talking about that.
[time=1013] And I want to kind of frame it up for you in four categories.
[time=1016] So here we go, Dad's, what are you characterized by on this investment front?
[time=1022] And what I mean by characterized is this, what consistent patterns exist in your life as a dad as it relates to making a relationally meaningful example,
[time=1036] investment, what patterns exist in your life
[time=1043] as it relates to making a spiritually, meaningful investment, what consistent patterns exist in your life, fathers in the room today as it relates to an emotionally meaningful investment.
[time=1059] And what patterns, what consistency is there in your life as a dad, as it relates to you making a physically meaningful investment.
[time=1069] These would be the things some would call the heavy lifting of fatherhood.
[time=1074] These are significant arenas.
[time=1076] These really do capture and represent God's design for you as a father.
[time=1081] And I want us to look at this together.
[time=1083] Over the past 19 years, it's amazing.
[time=1085] I think back I've been fathering for 19 years.
[time=1089] Over those past 19 years of my own life and in all the years I've worked with and tried to be an encouragement to families.
[time=1096] I've come to a very simple, yet profound conclusion for those of you dads in the room today as it relates to the level of your relational, spiritual, emotional, physical patterns.
[time=1110] Here's the simple, yet profound conclusion and it's really true, you're one of two things, my friends.
[time=1116] You're either engaged in those patterns.
[time=1120] You're either very present in the midst of those arenas.
[time=1129] Mind, body, soul.
[time=1133] I mean, you're either engaged in those endeavors with your kids or you're what?
[time=1140] Or you're not.
[time=1141] Or you're disengaged, you're absent.
[time=1145] And you might be absent literally or you might be absent figuratively.
[time=1150] There but not there.
[time=1151] Not engaged in making an investment.
[time=1156] Relationally, spiritually, emotionally and physically.
[time=1161] Guys, dads, you're more on one side or the other, you just are and I'm not here to overly applaud you this morning, I'm not here to overly ridicule you this morning, I'm here to paint as clear a picture as possible of what God honoring, fathering looks like so you and I can keep, listen dads, so you and I can keep learning and growing as dads.
[time=1185] And oh please tell me, please every one of you tell me that you're still up for learning and growing
[time=1197] and getting better.
[time=1199] Please tell me that you haven't stopped being willing to be taught by God and stretched by Him and encouraged in this unbelievable endeavor.
[time=1212] I'll be honest with you, when I was 38, 10 years ago, when I was 38, I honestly, I wouldn't have said it to you
[time=1224] this way then, but I can certainly say it to you this way now.
[time=1227] At 38, I was really close to pretty much thinking I had it figured out.
[time=1233] At 38, I really thought that as a father, as a husband,
[time=1240] as a leader, as a pastor, I really thought I was pretty smart and I'm telling you at 48, a mere 10 years later, I feel like I practically know nothing and there is so much for me to still see, so many things, I've not gotten right, so much that needs address, so many things that need attention in my leadership, marriage, kids, that whole world, and so I hope this morning, whoever you are, whether you're kids two, 18 or 40, anywhere in between, I hope your heart is humble and soft today and receptive to what God will have for you.
[time=1282] This drama that you're gonna see here just kind of paints a very real, little uncomfortable, but very real picture of what so many dads today struggle with in their effort to be a father.
[time=1297] - Yep, so far so good.
[time=1298] - Oh honey, I'm glad you're home.
[time=1301] Sam's aren't away back from tryouts and boy, you look really good tonight.
[time=1308] Are you ready to go?
[time=1310] Just, I can't wait to see what you've got planned for us tonight.
[time=1313] - Wait, wait, hold on, planned?
[time=1314] What do you mean?
[time=1316] - It's Thursday.
[time=1318] - Thursday, Thursday, yeah.
[time=1321] - Date night. - Date night, yes.
[time=1322] Yeah, that's my job to create something so we can go on a date.
[time=1325] - That's right. - Hey, and I'm like the best at creating these things, and I did.
[time=1329] I planned something, really great, but we just can't do it tonight.
[time=1334] - Oh no, it's tonight.
[time=1336] Tonight is date night.
[time=1337] - I know, tonight is date night, but yes, tonight is date night, but the boss called, and there's this client that he has to maximize his time while he's here in town, and I have to handle it.
[time=1350] - And you know I love that, but it's tonight.
[time=1354] This is the only night that we have this week to go out.
[time=1357] - Right, and we're gonna do that one night a week together, just another night.
[time=1361] I mean, but I gotta do this.
[time=1362] I mean, the boss wants me to do it, and what am I gonna do?
[time=1364] Say no to him, I mean, but it'll be great.
[time=1368] I just need you to hold on to this.
[time=1371] - I should have known this was coming.
[time=1374] - What?
[time=1376] There's nothing I can do.
[time=1377] I mean, this is for our future, right?
[time=1379] - Yes, it is, and well, it's only dinner, right?
[time=1383] - Yes, just dinner.
[time=1384] I mean, I won't let the client go on and on.
[time=1387] We'll end it early, and we'll be done.
[time=1389] - And then maybe watch a movie after?
[time=1391] - Yes, I'll pick up a movie on the way home.
[time=1393] I mean, I'll get a chick flick, sci-fi comedy.
[time=1396] You know, we'll laugh, we'll cry.
[time=1397] - Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad.
[time=1399] Dad, guess what I made.
[time=1400] - You made a B?
[time=1401] - No, Dad, guess.
[time=1402] - You made a D, what?
[time=1403] - No, Dad, I made the volleyball team.
[time=1404] - You made the volleyball team.
[time=1406] Oh, that's great.
[time=1407] I didn't even know you liked volleyball.
[time=1409] - Yeah.
[time=1409] - I used to play volleyball in college.
[time=1411] I mean, we could play together, that'd be great.
[time=1413] - Yeah, it starts this Monday, and I was wondering if you could take me to go get my stuff.
[time=1417] - Yeah, your mom will take you, and I'll tell you what, here, take the credit card, and just get whatever you need, and I'll look into coaching, and then that way we could be together, you know?
[time=1428] - Yeah, but I was really hoping that you and I could go together.
[time=1432] - Oh, I'm sorry, I can't right now, but here.
[time=1435] You hold on to this, and when things settle down, it'll be like top gun, you know, Maverick and Goose, like high five.
[time=1442] - Listen, honey, obviously, we're not going out tonight, and you can't help Sam.
[time=1448] So that gives me so much more to do.
[time=1450] Laundry, homework, and not dinner.
[time=1453] - What do you want me to do?
[time=1454] - I want you to take some of this.
[time=1456] - I can, not right now.
[time=1457] I mean, this is the busy season.
[time=1458] - It's been the busy season for five years.
[time=1461] - But this is what we talked about.
[time=1463] I mean, you know, our ship's gonna come in, and when it does, it'll be smooth sailing.
[time=1468] Yeah, just hang in there.
[time=1469] Dad, since you can't take me to go get my stuff, will you at least promise me you'll come to my scrimmage for next week?
[time=1474] - Yes, I promise.
[time=1475] - No, Dad, look at me.
[time=1476] - Okay.
[time=1477] - Do you promise me?
[time=1478] I really want you to be there.
[time=1478] It means a lot to me.
[time=1479] - Yes, I promise, I promise I'll be there, whether it's me or via the video, your mom records and you watch it later.
[time=1486] - Well, what do you want me to do?
[time=1487] I mean, look, here's what I promise.
[time=1489] I promise things are gonna get better, but I can't do anything about that, right?
[time=1493] Now, I'm doing the best that I can here.
[time=1495] Look, I don't wanna argue in front of our daughter, but if it means that much to you, I'll reschedule with the client.
[time=1503] Is that what you want?
[time=1504] - No, of course not.
[time=1506] I don't want you to postpone or cancel.
[time=1509] - Good, 'cause that's not what I wanted either, and you know, I'm glad we're on the same page here, you know?
[time=1513] I mean, this is really gonna be good for us, but I gotta get going.
[time=1516] - Dad, this is ridiculous.
[time=1517] I don't even care if you come to my game, just take some of this.
[time=1520] - No, stop, you're my girl.
[time=1521] You could do it in there.
[time=1522] - No, Dad, it's not fair.
[time=1524] - Oh, come on, you've got it so much easier than I did when I was your age.
[time=1527] I mean, I used to carry like 15 of those.
[time=1530] I mean, ladies, trust me, it'll be good.
[time=1533] Hold on.
[time=1533] Yeah, okay, I'm on my way.
[time=1537] I gotta go, hugs and kisses.
[time=1540] I'll be there in 10 minutes.
[time=1542] (knocking) Oh, I forgot my briefcase.
[time=1551] Wait, what's going on here?
[time=1553] Why did you guys drop these?
[time=1555] Dad, I don't even care anymore.
[time=1558] - What is she talking about?
[time=1561] - Well, what do you expect?
[time=1562] She's only 17 and you expect her to carry this whole load.
[time=1566] - I don't see what the big deal is.
[time=1567] I mean, what do you want from me?
[time=1569] - I want you.
[time=1570] - You've got me.
[time=1572] - I don't have you.
[time=1573] Your job has you.
[time=1575] I don't even know who you are anymore.
[time=1579] You know, my mother was right about all this.
[time=1583] Wait, wait, wait.
[time=1585] You can't bring up your mom and then leave like that.
[time=1587] You can't do that.
[time=1589] Does this mean I don't need to bring home a movie tonight?
[time=1592] - A couple of things to just take note of there
[time=1601] and then we're gonna move on.
[time=1603] As I watched it first hour, I was just reminded that there's a difference between, and you see this with kids, you see this with adults, and I wanna just, maybe it goes without saying, but I wanna just say it anyway.
[time=1619] I'm trying.
[time=1620] Hey, look, I'm trying.
[time=1624] How many times have you heard that from your kids?
[time=1631] And the point I'm making is there's a difference.
[time=1633] Just don't forget.
[time=1634] There's a difference between really trying and saying I'm really trying as an excuse because you're really not.
[time=1643] Sometimes we just need to understand that trying isn't what we're after.
[time=1652] What we're after is you or me doing.
[time=1655] And sometimes I'm trying just kind of as a way to kind of keep the heat out here when the heat needs to kind of come all the way in and expose you and me for the reality of the fact that we're just not getting it done.
[time=1671] So be careful with that.
[time=1672] The second thing I just, I'm struck by as I watch this, and I think any dad in the room would agree with me, fathering and being a husband.
[time=1684] It's a heavy load.
[time=1686] It is, and I'm not saying that in a negative way.
[time=1688] And you were designed by God to carry that load, not them.
[time=1695] They've got loads that they carry.
[time=1697] But fathering and being a husband, it does require an enormous amount of heavy lifting.
[time=1702] It does.
[time=1703] And he designed you and he made you and he has promised to help you carry that load when you're willing as a dad and a husband to be all that he called you to be.
[time=1713] So let's look at these things this morning.
[time=1715] This design that God has given us for effective fathering.
[time=1718] It starts with you and me making a relational investment.
[time=1723] I hope you'll write these down, guys.
[time=1725] I hope they'll just take some notes this morning.
[time=1727] You and I have been designed by God to make a relational investment in our kids.
[time=1732] I'll never forget when Russell T., my son was about a year old and a pastor who I worked with made a huge investment in my life.
[time=1741] And his name was Tom, and Tom would tell me, as Russell got a little older and older, he'd say, "Hey, don't forget to get on the floor." He would say it to me again and again, "Hey, don't forget." He'd say, "Don't forget to get on the floor with him." And what he was talking about was the fact that there were times where even as a young dad with a new son who I loved, there were times where I would kind of observe him on the floor.
[time=1765] And what Tom was saying was get down on the floor, get on your knees on the carpet, roll up your sleeves, play blocks, play hot wheels, get the pins out.
[time=1777] I mean, do whatever you gotta do, but get down on the floor, look that little guy in the eye and be with him.
[time=1787] Don't sit at the table reading the paper saying, "Isn't he cute?" Don't walk by and ask him as you're walking by, "Hey, buddy, are you having fun?" Get on the floor, he would tell me.
[time=1802] Get dirty, go mix it up.
[time=1804] Now, let me just say this plainly and simply, guys, I know, I know you can do this.
[time=1810] And I know that most of us realize the fact that we as men aren't relational giants.
[time=1815] Some may have a bent more toward it than others, but I know men sometimes struggle with this thought.
[time=1820] I know that for many men, when it comes to their wives or when it comes to a kid, a teenager in crisis, or I know 10 minutes sometimes seems to a man like a lengthy conversation.
[time=1831] I know we don't get Oprah, we don't understand how all that works as men.
[time=1838] We never really get in fights with our friends 'cause I don't think we ever talk about things with our friends long enough or deepen up to get in fights or arguments.
[time=1846] I know some may, but as a pattern, we oftentimes view ourselves as not being very relational.
[time=1854] And here I'm telling you this morning that at the foundation of your fatherhood, it matters that you make a relational contribution.
[time=1862] And while you and I might say we struggle on the relational front, I'll just say to you this, I've been in a buffalo wild wings with 200 men watching football and it wasn't quiet.
[time=1873] There was a lot of talking going on.
[time=1878] There was a lot being said, conversations being had, eye contact, empathy, empathy, absolutely.
[time=1887] Manning throws an interception.
[time=1889] Oh, no, did you see that?
[time=1893] Empathy, no one's falling asleep.
[time=1897] Nobody asleep in BWs.
[time=1900] Sunday night games, go on till 10, 10, 30, 11, guys, wide awake, talking, eye contact, empathy, relationship getting further.
[time=1911] Dad's, understand, you can do this and you can say, well, that's BWs and that's the cults.
[time=1919] And I would say, and they're your kids.
[time=1924] And your point is what?
[time=1925] Get on the floor with them.
[time=1929] Go sit down with them.
[time=1933] Look at them, be close to them.
[time=1936] Ask them questions about their life.
[time=1939] Listen to their answers and ask another one.
[time=1942] Go out with them.
[time=1945] Listen to what's going on in their world.
[time=1947] Do anything and everything you can possibly do to relationally connect with your son or daughter.
[time=1954] It is part of a foundation that will give you a relationship with them now and in the days to come that will be meaningful and significant.
[time=1963] Relationally get on the floor with them.
[time=1967] Roll up your sleeves.
[time=1969] Spiritually, turn to Psalm 78, would you?
[time=1972] Open your Bibles this morning to Psalm 78 verses five to eight, you're gonna see in these few verses an unbelievable blueprint, a great guide for you as a dad to make a spiritual investment in your kids and what that spiritual investment should and can look like.
[time=1991] It says in Psalm 78 verse five, it says, for he established a testimony in Jacob, the people of Israel, for he established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers that they should teach them to their children, that the generation to come might know even the children yet to be born, that they may arise and tell them to their children, that they should put their confidence in God and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments and not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that did not, listen, that did not prepare its heart and whose spirit was not faithful to God.
[time=2046] I want you to go back to verse five.
[time=2050] I want you to see really the foundation of this teaching here in these verses as it relates to fathers and the investment that you get to make spiritually.
[time=2058] I want you to see two things, first of all, look in verse five, for he established a what?
[time=2063] Say it out loud, a testimony.
[time=2066] All right, what's a testimony?
[time=2067] It says here that God established for them a testimony, a testimony when someone comes up here on this stage or some people stand up in the waters of baptism or they're over in the pool when we do the baptism in the summer and you hear them tell their spiritual what?
[time=2083] You said it right there, say it louder.
[time=2085] The story, this word testimony has to do with the story of God and his faithfulness in their lives.
[time=2096] And he says here in verse five, for he God established a story, this narrative of God and his people and his faithfulness to them.
[time=2110] For he established a, number one, a testimony, a story in Jacob and appointed a law.
[time=2117] There's two things here at play, a story and the law.
[time=2122] The law was God's teaching.
[time=2126] The law was God's word.
[time=2128] The law was what God wanted the people to understand from his heart and mouth about how he'd long for and desired them to live.
[time=2136] And so God gave them a story, a testimony and the law, his teaching, his truth.
[time=2144] And God's design was for fathers to teach both.
[time=2151] He established a testimony in Jacob, appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers that they should teach what, them.
[time=2164] The them there are those two things.
[time=2168] Teach them about God and tell them stories about his faithfulness and his goodness.
[time=2174] It reminds me of what you see when you go back to go, turn your Bibles, please go ahead, pick up your Bible, turn it to Deuteronomy four, open up Deuteronomy four verses one to four, would you do that?
[time=2187] Deuteronomy four, the teachings, the truth, the law, the statutes of God and we wanna see the story of God, you get a little taste of this in Deuteronomy four, says in verse one, now, oh Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments, there's the law, which I am teaching you to perform so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, is giving.
[time=2217] You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you nor take away from it that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you, your eyes, here comes the story, your eyes have seen what the Lord has done in the case of Baal, payor for all the men who followed Baal, payor, the Lord your God has destroyed them.
[time=2240] You've seen that, you watched that happen.
[time=2243] The Lord destroyed them from among you.
[time=2247] But you who held fast to the Lord your God are alive today, every one of you, look at verse nine, only give heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently, keep it healthy so that you do not forget the things which your eyes have seen and they do not depart from your heart all the days of your life, but make them all these things that you've seen, all this stuff that you've been taught, all the great commandments and statutes and experiences with God, make them known to your sons and your grandsons.
[time=2285] Because when you do that, God will bless them.
[time=2288] When you do that, he will be honored.
[time=2291] Look at judges, go to judges.
[time=2295] Go to Judges chapter two, an amazing scene here
[time=2301] in Judges two, Joshua has just died and I want you to be reminded of what happened to the people of Israel.
[time=2309] Strike that, I want you to be reminded of what happened to the kids of Israel as it relates to the investment spiritually that their fathers in this case didn't make.
[time=2321] Look what it says in Judges two, it says then, Joshua, the mighty Joshua, the son of none, the servant of the Lord died at the age of 110 and they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath Harris in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gash.
[time=2340] All, listen, all that generation, Joshua's, also were gathered to their fathers.
[time=2348] So Joshua and all of his buddies, Joshua and all of his friends, Joshua and all of his peers and contemporaries eventually die and are gathered up, it says they're in the text with their fathers.
[time=2362] And there arose another generation after them, seriously people, these are the sons and daughters of Joshua and his contemporaries.
[time=2373] And there arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord.
[time=2383] And you read that and you go, oh my goodness, how can this be?
[time=2389] They didn't know the Lord, well it doesn't stop there, it says they didn't know the Lord and they didn't even know what God had done.
[time=2397] They didn't know about the work of God.
[time=2401] They didn't know the story of God.
[time=2403] They'd never heard the testimonies of all that God had done, which he had done for Israel.
[time=2412] And you say, wow, what happens to a kid who never really gets taught, who never really gets invested in when it comes to the teachings and the stories of God?
[time=2421] Then the sons of Israel did say it, church, evil.
[time=2426] And the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and served the bales and they forsook the Lord.
[time=2433] The God of their fathers who had brought them out of the land of Egypt.
[time=2437] You say, what did he do?
[time=2438] He brought them out of the land of Egypt.
[time=2441] He rescued them.
[time=2444] He cared for them and they followed other gods from among the gods of the peoples who were around them and bowed themselves down to them, worshiped other gods.
[time=2458] Thus they provoked the Lord to anger.
[time=2462] Wow.
[time=2464] The scripture's really clear here.
[time=2467] In Psalm 78, teach, teach the Bible.
[time=2472] Teach the truth.
[time=2474] Teach the law to your kids.
[time=2477] Teach, you understand teach?
[time=2478] Sometimes we make more of teaching than is really there.
[time=2481] Understand this teaching is explaining to them what the Bible says and helping them know how to apply it.
[time=2487] That's it.
[time=2488] And we can make that really complicated and we can make that really involved.
[time=2492] But please, please don't be intimidated by this thought.
[time=2495] You can and I can and if you can't, we can help you.
[time=2498] You may be here in the room this morning already just going, wow, I need some help on this stuff.
[time=2503] I'm getting it.
[time=2504] It's really important.
[time=2506] And if you feel like you'd have a hard time teaching them and explaining the Bible and helping them apply it will help you, anybody.
[time=2516] You raise your hand, you come talk to us, you contact, will help you do that better with your kids.
[time=2521] I promise you, but it's explaining it to them and helping them understand what it means to apply it in their lives.
[time=2532] Teach the Bible to your kids and tell them stories about God.
[time=2539] Verse six, as you keep making your way through our passage, remember you're not just doing this for your kids, this is a mind-boggling truth, but you're also doing it for your kids, kids.
[time=2553] As you do this, dads, today don't lose sight of your grandchildren, the text teaches.
[time=2561] That the generation to come might know even the children yet to be born, that they may arise and tell them, them there is the teachings and the stories.
[time=2575] So now we're talking about an investment you make today that allows your grandkids who aren't even born yet to grow up someday and tell their kids of the teachings of God and the stories of God.
[time=2586] And it's all tied back to you and your faithfulness.
[time=2592] Here in verse six, God reveals his spiritual, generational succession plan.
[time=2597] That's right, his spiritual generational succession plan.
[time=2601] And guess what God's plan is?
[time=2603] On the spiritual succession front, his plan seems to be from verse six, you.
[time=2607] That's up to you.
[time=2610] And the key phrase I want you to circle, the key word I don't want you to miss here, dads, is that the generation to come might know.
[time=2623] It's one thing for the generation to come.
[time=2626] It's one thing for them to kind of have an idea.
[time=2629] It's one thing, and sometimes this is how we go about it.
[time=2633] And sometimes this is the fruit of our efforts, 'cause we're trying.
[time=2636] Sometimes the fruit is, yeah, I know about him.
[time=2643] Sometimes the fruit is, yeah, I'm somewhat familiar with all that.
[time=2649] But he says, no, no, no, no, no, no, the fruit here, the purpose is that they would know.
[time=2657] That word no is really cool.
[time=2659] That word no is a deep internal knowledge.
[time=2664] And understanding that accurately informs and guides them in their living and choosing.
[time=2671] There's three things I want you to write down here.
[time=2675] Three things that happen when fathers teach and tell stories about God.
[time=2683] And we get this right from verse seven.
[time=2686] You do all this, you give yourself dad to the teaching of not only the law, his word is truth, but the stories about God.
[time=2695] And there's three things that happen when you do number one, kids remember.
[time=2699] Hope you'll write this down.
[time=2700] Kids are more apt to put their confidence.
[time=2704] Excuse me, remember is the second one.
[time=2705] The first one is kids are more apt to put their confidence and trust in God.
[time=2713] Number one thing you'll see there is that kids trust.
[time=2716] Kids trust when they learn to trust.
[time=2720] They have a propensity toward trusting him.
[time=2723] Their confidence is more and more likely to be placed in him and not others when you're willing and ready on a regular basis to teach them and tell them stories about God.
[time=2735] Listen, don't miss this dad's.
[time=2737] Where there's, you know this in your life, I know this in mine, any mom or wife knows this.
[time=2741] Anybody in the room knows this.
[time=2743] Wherever there's trust, when you trust that something will hold, when you trust that something will stand, when you trust that something will come through for your willing to step on it, you're willing to go that way.
[time=2763] Trust is what gives birth to following.
[time=2768] Are you with me?
[time=2770] And you and I see it all the time today.
[time=2772] You do this, I do this.
[time=2776] Our kids are getting taught to do this, to trust other things, to believe in and put their confidence in things that their hearing will most certainly bring them fulfillment and life and meaning.
[time=2792] And we're going, no, no, no, no, dad's dads really help them understand and help them see that trusting in God first and foremost, above and beyond all others will give them a place to step.
[time=2809] As a dad, how many times have you and I in amusement parks, how many times have you and I, hiking, how many times have you and I in crowded situations, turn back and said to them, listen, just step where I, what, step.
[time=2822] So you do that, dads.
[time=2827] You do that, teach them the truth and tell them stories about God and his faithfulness to Joshua and to you.
[time=2836] And it will build in them this understanding and this ability to trust and follow.
[time=2842] Second thing that happens when fathers teach and tell stories about God is that kids develop a God-centered memory.
[time=2851] Kids develop a God-centered memory that guides them in life when dads teach and tell stories about God, kids remember, kids remember.
[time=2864] You can tell them stories about David and Bathsheba, right?
[time=2870] Were they there for David and Bathsheba?
[time=2874] And again, don't forget Joshua's kids.
[time=2876] Joshua's kids were there.
[time=2878] All his buddies' kids were there.
[time=2881] And they never heard the stories.
[time=2885] So being there, David and Bathsheba, you could teach your kids about David and Bathsheba's baby and in telling them that story, teach them about godly consequences and God's heart for restoration.
[time=2896] You could tell them stories about the Egyptians' abuse of the people of Israel and in the process, you can teach them about hope and hard times.
[time=2905] You could tell them stories about Peter, especially Peter at the point of the crucifixion.
[time=2909] You could tell them stories about a second, a third, a fourth chance and you could teach them about God's grace.
[time=2914] When dads take time to teach and tell stories about God,
[time=2920] kids learn to obey.
[time=2927] When you're willing to teach them about God's truth and when you're willing to tell them stories about those who followed it and those who didn't, when you're willing to tell them stories about times you did and didn't, when you make that investment, it teaches them, it heightens the great priority and value of obedience.
[time=2945] There's a relational investment to make.
[time=2949] There's a spiritual investment to make an emotional, let me just say this, emotionally dads, emotionally they need you.
[time=2957] This can't be all mom.
[time=2959] And I know some of you in the room just think that's her gig and you're gonna go play ball with them.
[time=2964] No, listen, this can't be all mom.
[time=2966] Mom's gonna be more bent in this direction quite possibly.
[time=2969] She might be better at it, but dads don't forget this.
[time=2972] Dads have to be connected to what their kids are feeling.
[time=2976] If you somehow try and do this thing, dads, without being connected to what they're feeling you will lose and they will suffer.
[time=2984] And here's the real opportunity.
[time=2985] It's not just being aware of your sons or your daughter's feelings, it's helping them understand how the relationship with God can help them navigate, make their way through, give them hope in the midst of those feelings.
[time=2999] Dads, are you aware of how insecure your daughter might be feeling as she sees other girls, her age with boyfriends or other girls being pursued by boys?
[time=3013] The feeling that I said was insecure dads, would you be aware of how insecure that can make a girl when they're all getting pursued and she's not?
[time=3026] And maybe she's not being pursued because they're not calling or maybe she's not being pursued 'cause you won't let them, but either way, do you understand how she would feel in the midst of that?
[time=3038] And are you willing to identify that and help her understand?
[time=3042] You say that's a conversation for her mom.
[time=3044] No, it's a conversation you can have with her to help her navigate those waters.
[time=3050] Dads, are you aware of how deeply fearful your 12 or 13-year-old is about being different?
[time=3057] You see, you're teaching them, you're wanting to talk with them about how important it is that they in this world today and in their lives that they act and choose in an uncommon way.
[time=3067] We say be different, we say what they're hearing is, stand out like a sore thumb and do things that nobody else is doing and be proud of it and be confident in it and they're just going, oh my gosh, if I do all this, if I act this way and I kinda want to because I believe it's true, I'm gonna be alone and you know what they will be.
[time=3089] You know it's true and I know it's true in many ways.
[time=3094] Fearful, dads, are you willing to enter into that fear with them and talk them through that?
[time=3100] Dads, do you understand that you're 18 or 19-year-old?
[time=3103] As they go off to college, as they graduate and move forward in life to a job, whatever it might be, dads, do you understand that you're 18, 19-year-old, maybe feeling confused, deeply about God, as they experience the collision
[time=3119] of all that you taught them and all that the world is telling them and how are you gonna sit with them and talk with them and not be scared and not get angry and not feel threatened by the fact that they're asking questions, you kinda hope they'd never ask, but the reality is they are.
[time=3140] And how will you enter into that with them and be a guide and be an encouragement in security, fear, confusion?
[time=3148] Do you realize, dads, how inadequate your child could begin to feel in this culture of ours?
[time=3154] Where everything is about image and everything is about performance and everything is about possessions and what if you're 10 to 16-year-old doesn't have much of any of the three?
[time=3165] Not a lot of possessions, not a lot of image, not a lot of performance and they can just begin to be fearful and upset and bothered and concerned and feel inadequate and how I'm just giving you, I could just give you example after example of these feelings that you as a dad cannot walk by and say, "Hey, I hope you figured that out." Physically, physically, I'll just say this,
[time=3192] somebody taught me this years ago and I'm so thankful.
[time=3196] I sure hope you hug 'em and I sure hope you kiss 'em and I hope you hold their hands when you're in public.
[time=3205] I hope you wrestle with 'em.
[time=3207] I hope that one of the first things you do, you know, when the day starts is put your arms around 'em, I hope on the last things you do is kiss 'em on the head and pray with 'em, I hope there's a closeness, a physical proximity that they sense and feel from you that is a conduit for them as they understand better God's constant presence and touch in their lives.
[time=3226] They don't get that if it's not for you and I hope as a dad you'll do that.
[time=3231] Every father in the room doesn't matter how old you are, how new this is to you, how long you've been at it.
[time=3237] If you just stand with your heads bowed and your eyes closed, dads, I wanna just remind you, you gotta be on the floor with them, you wanna teach them, tell them stories about God, you've got to know what they're feeling and then with real wisdom and guts, help 'em deal with those things in a way that honors God and you sure better hang on to 'em.
[time=3264] You better physically love on them so they know where they can get that and so they know where that can come from.
[time=3274] And as you stand this morning, dads, I wanna just give you the chance to do two things.
[time=3278] Number one, I wanna just give you a moment where you can confess because if you're anything like me, as I thought through these things this week, there's just pockets all over the page where I just am not who I know God wants me to be, I need to confess these things to my kids and I need to be willing to go in a different direction.
[time=3301] And so I wanna just give you the chance you may have a wife next to you, you may have some kids nearby you, if they wanna put their hand on your back, if they wanna stand next to you, you can do that family.
[time=3313] I wanna give your father a chance to confess some things in his heart and just do that right now guys, just in the honesty of your heart quietly before God with those who you love around you possibly today, confess what isn't as it should be and beg him for the strength and courage to make it right.
[time=3334] Secondly, I wanna just give you the chance, dads, to pick something, I think years ago I would've just said pick it all, but I'm learning, I'm learning, I'm still learning.
[time=3345] Pick one thing today, right now, of those things we talked about this morning, where did the conviction meter spike the highest today?
[time=3355] And you know where that is and you know the area where you really wanna not only confess but move in a different direction.
[time=3365] So I want you to name it and I just want you to commit to God in your own heart just as you pray to him and talk to him just briefly here.
[time=3374] What is that one area?
[time=3376] Say it to him, ask him for his help and commit to tell your kids, your wife, your good friends, your small group.
[time=3385] I mean it, pick it, name it, ask for his help right now.
[time=3393] Our Father in heaven, I'm so honored to stand this morning with these men in this room, every one of them with great capacity because you made them to serve in love and care for and lead their families well.
[time=3409] And God, I know that there are men who stand here today and they're in a number of different circumstances.
[time=3415] In some cases, the uniqueness of their situation makes things very difficult.
[time=3421] In other situations, God, it really is just a matter of choice.
[time=3425] And I pray, God, that in every situation you would uniquely move.
[time=3430] God, that you would uniquely speak to these men.
[time=3434] We know that you have forgiven them as they confess they're falling short.
[time=3439] They're sinned to you today.
[time=3441] And we know, God, that you are willing and ready to walk with them in the days to come to give them strength and courage and the guts to pursue the one thing that they've identified today, oh, God, help them.
[time=3451] Do that and remind them of all that is at stake.
[time=3455] We love you and we're thankful that you've allowed us to be a dad and might be the most powerful word.
[time=3463] It's such a powerful word, dad.
[time=3469] And it can be so powerful in a good way or it can be so powerful in a bad way.
[time=3475] So God, I pray that for the dads in this room today, that they would follow you, that they would trust you and that they would teach and tell stories about you.
[time=3485] In your son's name, we pray, amen.
[time=3489] (upbeat music)
