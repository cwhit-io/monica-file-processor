[time=1162] Friends, as we start this morning,
[time=1185] I'm brokenhearted to share what many of you already know that I got a phone call from Kelly in the middle of the night on Saturday that Dr. Steve and Kim Hatch were killed in a plane crash this past Friday.
[time=1199] Their son Austin was with them.
[time=1201] Austin is in a medically induced coma in Northern Michigan.
[time=1205] We would beg you to beg God for them
[time=1212] in what is, by any measure, an unimaginable circumstance.
[time=1217] I'm very grateful for the grace and mercy of God as I prepared this week to share with you from 1 Timothy 6.
[time=1228] That's our text this morning.
[time=1231] In that passage, I find these words.
[time=1236] 1 Timothy 6 verses 17 through 19.
[time=1239] As for the rich in this present age,
[time=1249] charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
[time=1259] They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, thus storing up for themselves a treasure as a good foundation for the future,
[time=1273] that they may take hold of that which is truly life.
[time=1278] Anybody who knew Steve and Kim could hardly describe them better than that,
[time=1285] rich in good works, generous, ready to share.
[time=1291] I can't begin to tell you the generosity that they've shown to me, my family, to so many of us.
[time=1297] Kim was in Joplin, Missouri last week, helping with the victims there.
[time=1304] I want to read you another passage of Scripture as well.
[time=1307] From 1 Thessalonians chapter 4.
[time=1314] I thought of this as I sat with my wife and were at the service for Corbin and Tanya this past Monday.
[time=1322] And these words have been in my heart and mind all week.
[time=1326] 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 starting in verse 13.
[time=1332] We don't want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do, who have no hope.
[time=1342] For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep.
[time=1349] This we declare to you by a word from the Lord that we who are alive who are left until the coming of the Lord will not proceed those who have fallen asleep.
[time=1357] The Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, with a sound of the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
[time=1367] Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.
[time=1376] Therefore, encourage one another with these words.
[time=1381] Please pray for the Hatch family.
[time=1391] Please pray for Maria, her husband Jason, Brittany, her fiancé, Jared, Austin Thomas,
[time=1399] Kim's kids, for Steve's parents, Jim and Peg Hatch, for Kim's mom, grandmother, sisters and nieces.
[time=1407] Morning is second time.
[time=1412] Steve's brother Michael and his sons, Andrew and PJ, Steve's sister Julie and their three children.
[time=1420] Would you please church, lift this family before the Lord this week and in the weeks to come, God is faithful, and all of his promises are true, especially in circumstances that we cannot understand.
[time=1436] And I'll leave you with one more thing from the Psalms before we pray.
[time=1440] Psalm 34-17 says, "When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears
[time=1449] and delivers them out of all their troubles, the Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the Christian spirit."
[time=1460] Would you please pray with me?
[time=1463] O dear Father, we beg you to be gracious and merciful to this dear family,
[time=1481] and mourning losses that defy explanation.
[time=1488] I thank you that the words that we sang this morning are true that you are an amazing God.
[time=1494] I thank you that you are a very present help in our trouble.
[time=1498] I thank you that you have allowed us to not mourn like those that have no hope, but we do mourn God, we mourn Zoe Hope, we mourn Steve and Kim,
[time=1509] and we pray for Austin in the hospital fighting this morning.
[time=1512] Please be with him, and please be with those who are around him.
[time=1518] I thank you that your Holy Spirit prays for us with groans, too deep for words.
[time=1525] Lord, my prayers have been stolen away, but I thank you that your Spirit prays for us in our sorrow and our sadness.
[time=1533] That we have a hope that is certain, and that you have a life that is true,
[time=1539] and I pray, Lord, steadfastly this morning, that we as a family would be quick to follow in the footsteps of Stephen Kim Hatch, who are generous, rich in good works, ready to share.
[time=1553] Examples to us all in so many ways.
[time=1557] Prays we open your word this morning as we continue that you would be gracious to us and give us ears to hear.
[time=1563] Pray all these things, Father, in Jesus' name.
[time=1566] [AMEN]
[time=1574] We are in 1 Timothy 6 this morning.
[time=1576] We're going to finish our time in 1 Timothy today, in chapter 6.
[time=1586] Kelly got the first two verses, the first Timothy 6, I've got the last 18 or so.
[time=1591] So I'll do my very best to do justice to this passage.
[time=1595] There's a lot to say.
[time=1597] And friends, I'm reminded of the faithfulness of God,
[time=1603] overwhelmingly reminded of His faithfulness, that we should say such things in the light of our circumstances.
[time=1610] I'm so grateful.
[time=1613] There is an outline in your bulletin that I invite you to follow along with.
[time=1619] The first thing that we read here in 1 Timothy 6 is about the good words of Jesus.
[time=1625] The sound words, His healthy words, life-giving words.
[time=1632] I'm jumping into verse 3, reading down through verse 5.
[time=1639] If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=1645] the teaching that accords with godliness, He is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing.
[time=1651] He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for corals about words,
[time=1658] which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions,
[time=1664] and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth.
[time=1670] Imagining that godliness is a means of gain.
[time=1676] As I read through this passage, it's a long passage with lots of strong words in it.
[time=1682] In fact, there are about 10 words in this passage that Paul doesn't use anywhere else in the New Testament.
[time=1687] Very, very strong language about the danger of false teachers, in fact, it's as though Paul is bookending his letter to Timothy
[time=1695] with a warning about false teachers in chapter 1 and now with another one in chapter 6.
[time=1701] Different doctrine from verse 3, different doctrine is literally hetero doctrine.
[time=1708] It's not a variation on the theme, it's different, and that's a once occurring word in the holy testament.
[time=1714] So it's a very unique thing. He's using very strong words to describe it.
[time=1718] This passage, friends, letters A and B in your outline is about two things, essentially, this part of the passage.
[time=1723] Letter A, it's about greediness and its outcome, and letter B, it's about godliness and its outcome.
[time=1733] He goes back and forth with describing each outcome.
[time=1736] So A could be godliness and its outcome, and B could be greediness and its outcome.
[time=1741] And you're not surprised to hear me say they are extraordinarily different outcomes.
[time=1746] And Paul has very strong words to say again about these things.
[time=1750] False doctrine is exposed as false friends when it compares with those sound words.
[time=1758] I've told you before, maybe in this very spot about bank tellers and how bank tellers know that a counterfeit is a counterfeit.
[time=1766] Not because they study a list of counterfeits all day long, but because they know the real thing so very well that when a fake one comes across her desk, they've got it, they've nailed it right away.
[time=1775] And I cannot help but wonder and submit to you this morning that our familiarity with the sound words, the healthy words,
[time=1783] the good words of Jesus will help us to recognize and respond appropriately to different doctrine, to false doctrine,
[time=1791] to false teachers in their schemes. Very, very important.
[time=1796] Verse 3, he says, "It doesn't agree. Does not agree."
[time=1802] These words were known to Paul and Timothy. So much they said, "Hey, that's not right.
[time=1809] I know what Jesus said, and what you are saying, false teacher, is not right.
[time=1813] This is a very great problem for Timothy very early on in the church.
[time=1818] Knowing the sound words of Jesus then friends can hardly be overestimated.
[time=1823] The outcome of godliness, one of them is knowing truth from error, understanding and having a sense of discernment about the way things need to be.
[time=1832] Look at the way that Paul describes what this different doctrine and one who teaches it, what he looks like.
[time=1838] Look at verse 4, he is puffed up with conceit, swollen almost with pride.
[time=1845] He's got a lack of understanding. One translation referred to as a pompous ignoramus.
[time=1850] Look at like a species of person, pompous ignoramus, that's the species.
[time=1857] This person has a diseased and morbid fondness for fights about words,
[time=1865] likes to split hairs, fights in which the words are the weapons and the object.
[time=1871] And there's nothing really real behind it, just fighting for fighting sake, wanting to be right.
[time=1877] This unhealthiness, this sense of this false doctrine, it leads to all kinds of things.
[time=1884] Envy and dissension and slander, evil suspicions.
[time=1888] Things you don't have good evidence about, but you want to run with anyway.
[time=1891] Evil suspicions, constant friction, constant arguing, irritation all the time.
[time=1898] Please notice with me friends, in verse 4, that all of those things, and into verse 5,
[time=1904] all of those things have to do with the way I relate to other people.
[time=1907] That a brokenness vertically leads to brokenness horizontally.
[time=1913] When I have a, when I have given into false teaching, when I have listened to what false teachers say, it cuts me off from other people.
[time=1922] It leads to envy, it leads to suspicion, it leads to constant friction all the time.
[time=1927] These warnings are not, these warnings are not to be taken lightly.
[time=1936] What's most remarkable about all of this is it leads, this false teaching leads to disruptions in my relationships, it leads to arguments, it leads to not good things.
[time=1945] How can I love my neighbor when I'm envying him or fighting with him?
[time=1950] I cannot, from the same spring can't come fresh water and salt water.
[time=1957] They're corrupted minds, verse 5.
[time=1962] They're depraved in mind, they're corrupted in mind, it leads to a truth-starved life.
[time=1971] It's very obvious, reading this passage with you, that what I think manifests itself
[time=1979] in what I do.
[time=1981] So a person who has a depraved mind will lead a depraved life.
[time=1985] A person who has a righteous mind will lead a righteous life.
[time=1988] I think about Romans 12 being transformed in their minds.
[time=1993] That's not accidental wording that Paul uses there.
[time=1996] In the word deprived, friends in verse 5 is robbed.
[time=2001] They are robbing themselves of the truth.
[time=2004] I will not listen, I will in this sense rob myself.
[time=2010] They imagine things.
[time=2012] You see that?
[time=2013] They imagine that Godliness is a means of gain.
[time=2016] They never really can be sure they imagine it might.
[time=2022] In every regard, James 1-8, in every regard they are unstable in all of their ways.
[time=2028] Unstable, they can't ever really have their feet on the ground because maybe this will lead to good things.
[time=2034] Maybe, I don't really know.
[time=2036] They imagine.
[time=2037] They don't know.
[time=2038] I'm so grateful that in John's letters in 1-2, John, he uses that word "no" a lot.
[time=2044] That you may know that you have eternal life.
[time=2046] What a beautiful thing.
[time=2048] This is something that the greedy and the Godless cannot understand.
[time=2053] That's the outcome.
[time=2055] It's the surge of the start of it.
[time=2057] It's all of those things that you see in verses 4 and 5.
[time=2061] Unhealthy cravings and depraved minds.
[time=2064] Look at verses 6 and 7 of 1 Timothy 6 with me, please.
[time=2069] Paul kind of churns it here.
[time=2070] There is indeed great gain in Godliness with contentment when it's accompanied by contentment.
[time=2078] 4.
[time=2079] We read nothing into the world and we can't take anything out of the world.
[time=2084] I saw my two children come into the world and they didn't have anything with them.
[time=2088] It was just them.
[time=2091] They didn't have any fanny packs.
[time=2094] Nothing attached but to my wife.
[time=2100] Think about that.
[time=2101] We brought nothing into the world and we can take nothing out of it.
[time=2104] That's the picture.
[time=2105] Naked we came and naked we leave.
[time=2115] We brought nothing in, we can take nothing out.
[time=2118] If we have food and clothing with these we will be content.
[time=2123] Is that how you would define contentment?
[time=2127] I'll have your clothes this morning.
[time=2130] Looks like you've all eaten recently.
[time=2136] Some, maybe more than others.
[time=2139] Is that my definition of contentment?
[time=2142] If I have food and I have clothes, that will be enough.
[time=2146] That's not how I imagine contentment.
[time=2150] Just one more thing.
[time=2156] That's not the way the Bible defines contentment.
[time=2160] Actually, Godliness is a means of real gain, genuine gain, not fake gain.
[time=2169] Look at what the Old Testament says about this.
[time=2171] Look at Psalm 37 16, it'll be on the screens before you.
[time=2178] Psalm 37 16, "Better is the little that the righteous has than the abundance of many wicked."
[time=2184] Do I believe that?
[time=2187] It's better that I have nothing and I'm righteous than look at all the wickedness around me and say, "Look at all they have and I'm okay with that.
[time=2195] Friends, I have to confess sometimes I'm not okay with that.
[time=2198] Why do they?" It's so unjust, God.
[time=2202] I have done all that you want me to do and look at everything they have and look at what little that I have.
[time=2208] Those thoughts creep in, friends, and when they creep in, the outcome, which he will expose to us here in verses 9 and 10, is terrifying.
[time=2217] Proverbs 15, 16 says this.
[time=2221] "Better is a little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and trouble with it."
[time=2229] And I don't think I think that way.
[time=2231] I think my great treasure will banish my troubles.
[time=2236] Is that any terribly wealthy person's real story?
[time=2242] Are they the happiest people that you know?
[time=2244] How many times, if we could go with Mark and Sarah to Kenya and talk to people living in Kenya,
[time=2250] who have nothing, and every time I hear from my students, who come back from mission strips, and they're part of a third world country, they tell me every single time they're the happiest people I've ever met in my life,
[time=2262] and they have nothing.
[time=2263] They have a shoebox of stuff, maybe less than that.
[time=2266] Have you all heard that?
[time=2267] Of course you've heard that story, over and over and over.
[time=2270] I have a student right now who is in Appalachia, terrible poverty, and I guarantee she will come back and she will tell me that there,
[time=2277] those people, through great struggle and hardship, can be, and in fact often are the most contented people that she knows.
[time=2283] With food and clothing, I'll be content.
[time=2286] I think Paul means it, guys.
[time=2290] I think that I need to check myself every single day against these temptations, and they're real temptations.
[time=2297] It's not pretend like it's not real.
[time=2299] Like all of us don't want to have more things from time to time.
[time=2306] Verse 7 is a powerful reminder that you can't take it with you.
[time=2309] Look at verses 8 through 10 with me.
[time=2314] If we have food and clothing, with these will be content, but those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people,
[time=2327] it's in this language, into ruin and destruction, and let's pause for a minute, take a step back from verse 10,
[time=2335] kind of take a minute and approach verse 10 as though you've never read it before.
[time=2341] That's hard to do, but you can do it.
[time=2343] This is one of the most misquoted verses in the whole Bible.
[time=2346] So let's read it exactly as it's written, okay?
[time=2349] 4. The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.
[time=2357] You've heard some version of that verse probably before that money is the root of all kinds of evil, or it's the root of all kinds of evil, and that's simply not what it says.
[time=2366] Far beat for me to downplay the dangers, because of what he says in the previous verse, but let's just read it properly.
[time=2372] The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.
[time=2377] It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.
[time=2387] Wow, Proverbs 15, 27 says, "Greed brings grief to the whole family, but those who hate bribes will live."
[time=2404] Proverbs 28, 20.
[time=2406] Also, these are very common themes in the Bible friends, so many warnings about this.
[time=2411] A faithful man will abound with blessings, but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished.
[time=2421] Ruin and destruction will not go unpunished.
[time=2424] I don't know how to make it stronger than that.
[time=2426] I don't need to.
[time=2428] The word plunge there, they're plunged, it says in verse 9, into ruin and destruction.
[time=2434] The word plunge is the word used in Luke 5 when the disciples' boat was filling up with fish, and their boat was going to sink.
[time=2442] Plunged, peril, ruin.
[time=2446] It's used by a Greek philosopher, Philostridus, describing the fall of Sparta as it burned.
[time=2455] Those who desire to be rich, that's what they're aiming at, but what they get is the polar opposite.
[time=2462] Ruin and destruction.
[time=2466] A stronger warning could hardly be imagined.
[time=2472] Love of money, friends, is the problem, not money.
[time=2476] The internet isn't the problem.
[time=2479] The way the internet is used is often the problem.
[time=2481] There is pornography going on in Paris within a week of the camera's invention.
[time=2486] It's no surprise.
[time=2488] The way you use things is the problem, not the things themselves.
[time=2491] The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, not money itself.
[time=2495] Look at what the passage says.
[time=2497] Look at the words in verse 9, people who want to be rich, people who are.
[time=2502] The love of money, verse 10, not money.
[time=2505] Some people, the NIV says, eager for money in verse 10.
[time=2510] Money is not the problem.
[time=2512] And acting as though it is, is its own kind of problem.
[time=2519] Outcomes, the outcomes of the love of money here are they've pierced themselves.
[time=2524] The word "pierce" is to impale.
[time=2527] Impelled themselves with many pangs, griefs, your translation might say, sorrows, different
[time=2538] doctrine, evil motivation, good words, sound words lead to righteousness.
[time=2546] Moving on to the second part of the passage, Romans 2 and the good fight.
[time=2551] The good fight.
[time=2555] And I love how he begins verse 11, but as for you, you aren't like them, man of God, but as for you, flee these things, pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness.
[time=2572] I was talking to a friend between the services.
[time=2576] And he said that a Korean general, when in face with a retreat, said, I'm not retreating,
[time=2583] I'm just advancing in a different direction.
[time=2587] So Paul says to flee, right, and pursue.
[time=2592] So it's not just running headlong away, there's something that you're heading after.
[time=2596] And I noticed friends that it's almost always in our lives, one or the other.
[time=2601] And it can't be one or the other has to be both.
[time=2604] It's not merely the negative, don't, don't, don't, isn't merely the do, do, do, do.
[time=2609] One leads to despair, and the other leads to self-righteousness.
[time=2613] But both together had this amazing outcome of godliness, godliness.
[time=2620] He says, flee all these things.
[time=2623] Verse 11, what things?
[time=2624] All that greediness, everything from verses 3 through 10.
[time=2629] He doesn't stop with flee though.
[time=2631] Again, he says, pursue, pursue what?
[time=2633] Righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness.
[time=2639] We cannot, friends, I tweeted this yesterday.
[time=2643] It's a brave new world tweeting on Twitter.
[time=2647] Do Twitter is to tweet, I don't know, these verb forms are, they define me.
[time=2651] But we cannot simply be people defined by what we don't do.
[time=2656] Oh, I know, do you think God doesn't, it can't ever merely be that.
[time=2660] Because if it's only ever merely that, then what do I do?
[time=2664] What is in place?
[time=2666] If it's what you don't, then you're some kind of a hermit.
[time=2671] To pursue is to follow and haste to find something.
[time=2675] Look at Psalm 34 verses 12 through 16.
[time=2685] Does anyone want to live a life that is long and prosperous?
[time=2691] Sounds like Star Trek.
[time=2696] Every bit's what we're after.
[time=2698] The rich went along in prosperous life.
[time=2700] Well, how do I get it?
[time=2701] Keep your tongue from speaking evil and lying on your income taxes.
[time=2707] Turn away from evil and do good.
[time=2709] Turn away and do good.
[time=2711] Flee, pursue.
[time=2714] Search for peace.
[time=2715] Work to maintain it.
[time=2717] The eyes of the Lord watch over those who do right.
[time=2721] His ears are open to their cries for help.
[time=2724] But, it's a dreadful but here.
[time=2728] The Lord turns his face against those who do evil.
[time=2731] He will erase their memory from the earth.
[time=2737] Because of what is both fled and pursued, the man of God may fight the good fight.
[time=2744] So, on your outline there, there's lots of verbs here.
[time=2747] Letter A, flee and pursue.
[time=2750] Flee and pursue.
[time=2752] And then the passage moves on in letter B to take hold and press on.
[time=2762] Verse 59 says, "The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, but he loves him who pursues righteousness."
[time=2770] God loves that kind of person.
[time=2774] Wow.
[time=2775] So, what is it to fight the good fight of faith?
[time=2777] It's all those things.
[time=2778] It's flee.
[time=2779] It's pursue.
[time=2780] It's take hold.
[time=2781] Take hold of what?
[time=2782] Eternal life.
[time=2784] Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter 9, "Don't you know that in a race all the runners run,
[time=2791] but only one receives the prize.
[time=2793] Run that you may obtain it.
[time=2796] Every athlete exercises self-control in all things.
[time=2799] They do it to receive a perishable wreath.
[time=2804] A trophy that was sitting collect dust, but we an imperishable.
[time=2808] I do not run aimlessly.
[time=2810] I do not box as one beating the air.
[time=2814] I discipline my body and keep under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified." God excuses himself from other people's priorities.
[time=2823] They're always his priorities too.
[time=2825] Very familiar here from Philippians 3.
[time=2828] Philippians 12 through 14.
[time=2832] Press on, right?
[time=2833] Not that I have already attained this, or I'm already perfect, but I press on to make it my own because Christ Jesus has made me his own.
[time=2841] Brothers and sisters, I do not consider that I have made it my own, but one thing I do,
[time=2848] is I'm waiting what lies behind, straining forward to what lies ahead.
[time=2852] I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[time=2860] That fight is his calling, friends.
[time=2862] It's what he's called to do.
[time=2866] Look at verse 13.
[time=2870] "I charge you in the presence of many witnesses of God who gives life to all things, Jesus, who had his testimony before Pontius Pilate, made the good confession, to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2886] The only way that any of us can keep that command unstained, spotless, and free from any kind of accusation or reproach is by the grace of God.
[time=2895] You cannot do it well enough.
[time=2897] And if you're trying, you will always be frustrated.
[time=2900] Always.
[time=2903] If you write this phrase down, and please rest in it, because it has really helped me in my life.
[time=2908] The phrase would be grace-driven effort.
[time=2912] Grace-driven effort.
[time=2916] Effort for sure.
[time=2917] There's all kinds of encouragements to give effort here, but it never is just effort.
[time=2922] I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, because you can't do it.
[time=2926] You can't keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach left to yourself.
[time=2931] You need his grace to drive you and to sustain you, and to hem you in when you fall or when you fail, because you will.
[time=2941] All this is possible, folks, because God is unbelievably magnificent.
[time=2946] Look at these verses.
[time=2947] Verse 15.
[time=2949] "Which he will display at the proper time, he who is the blessed and only sovereign, the king of kings, Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, who no one has ever seen or can see,
[time=2965] to him be honor and eternal dominion, amen." Dear friends, when you pray, when you pray for whatever you are praying for,
[time=2977] that's who you're praying to.
[time=2981] If you pray small prayers, stop.
[time=2985] Read Psalm 104 with me, go to Psalm 104.
[time=2990] I'm not sure if it will be up or not, but I'm so grateful that God and his great grace and mercy lead us to this passage today, and that will be in the Psalms the rest of the summer.
[time=3000] Where do we run when we have trouble in the Scriptures?
[time=3003] We run in the Psalms.
[time=3008] Psalm 104.
[time=3014] I can't wait to talk with you about the Psalms.
[time=3016] God is going to be good to us.
[time=3019] "Bless the Lord, O my soul, O Lord, my God, you are very great.
[time=3024] You are clothed with splendor and majesty covering yourself with light as with a garment,
[time=3033] stretching out the heavens like a tent.
[time=3036] He lays the beams of his chambers on the waters.
[time=3039] He makes the clouds his chariot.
[time=3041] He rides on the wings of the wind.
[time=3046] He makes his messengers, winds, his ministers of flaming fire.
[time=3050] That's who you're praying to.
[time=3053] Begg, God, this week, and when you beg him, understand that that's who you're talking to.
[time=3060] That's who you're petitioning, an omnipotent, immortal.
[time=3064] He dwells, friends, consider that phrase, he dwells in unapproachable light.
[time=3069] He lives in a place I can't approach, but yet tells me to seek his face and to pray to him.
[time=3082] So pray without ceasing.
[time=3085] Pray with the confident knowledge that God is who he says he is, and he will be faithful
[time=3092] to his word when he promises to sustain you in very hard times.
[time=3100] I'm leaving today to go to Chicago for a few days, this afternoon.
[time=3105] And Robby Zechariah is a person who has, I think, discipled me from a distance more than anybody else I can think of in my life.
[time=3115] And he said once, when things become difficult, the tendency is to turn away from God.
[time=3121] And then he said, but in heaven's name to what?
[time=3126] He is an ever-present help in trouble.
[time=3133] In this world, Jesus said you will have trouble, but fear not.
[time=3137] Take heart.
[time=3138] I have overcome the world.
[time=3140] Do you believe it?
[time=3142] He ends this passage, friends, with talk of a good foundation.
[time=3150] And returns to riches as his subject.
[time=3158] It has disastrous consequences, so it can hardly be emphasized too much.
[time=3167] None of us need to be reminded these days about the uncertainty of riches.
[time=3172] They are extraordinarily uncertain, no more so than these days.
[time=3177] Any look at your statement from your retirement will give you that indication.
[time=3183] Paul says to those who are rich in this present age, he says don't, and he says do.
[time=3188] Don't be arrogant.
[time=3190] Don't set your hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
[time=3198] So we have a good foundation, friends, letter A is a certain hope, a certain hope.
[time=3207] God richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
[time=3212] I didn't mention this for service, bonus coverage.
[time=3218] Is that the way people talk about God that you know that don't know him?
[time=3222] Oh, you're a Christian, you believe in that God who gives us everything to enjoy richly?
[time=3228] Or is it the God who, oh, that God is in the sky, his mr, thunderbolts, and lightning, and that God?
[time=3234] That's the picture.
[time=3237] Tim Keller tweeted this week, "The Christian message is not advice.
[time=3243] It's news.
[time=3247] What's the good news?
[time=3248] That's not what God is like.
[time=3250] I'm going to get you for that nasty thing.
[time=3252] You said this for me, your boss.
[time=3255] Richly provides us.
[time=3257] That's his heart for us.
[time=3258] Everything to enjoy.
[time=3260] Everything richly provides with everything to enjoy.
[time=3263] The language there is the same word about riches.
[time=3266] So Paul's being cute here.
[time=3269] He richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
[time=3280] Maybe your Bible is open in 2 Timothy chapter 1.
[time=3285] The second part of Roman number 3, Lord B, is truly life.
[time=3289] True life.
[time=3291] A good foundation is a certain hope in true life.
[time=3297] Here's the first verse of 2 Timothy.
[time=3301] Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus.
[time=3312] Life that is in Christ Jesus.
[time=3315] Your friends don't need your advice.
[time=3319] Sometimes that's appropriate.
[time=3320] But what they really need is what John says in 1 John chapter 5, 1 John chapter 5.
[time=3327] And then I want to read you a benediction from 1 Timothy and we'll be dismissed this morning.
[time=3334] 1 John chapter 5 verses 10 through 13.
[time=3337] This is what you need to preach this to yourself tomorrow and the day after and to your friends and your family that don't know Christ.
[time=3347] Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself.
[time=3351] Your life is a testimony.
[time=3355] Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony that God has born concerning his son.
[time=3362] And this is the testimony that God gave us eternal life and this life is in his son.
[time=3368] Whoever has the son has life.
[time=3371] Whoever does not have the son does not have life.
[time=3375] That is a very exclusive statement.
[time=3378] And please don't make it not exclusive because it is.
[time=3382] I write these things to you who believe in the name of the son of God that you may know that you have eternal life.
[time=3389] That you may know.
[time=3394] Would you stand with me please as we dismiss?
[time=3400] Every word I read from you with you this morning from the scriptures is true.
[time=3405] Everyone.
[time=3408] He is near to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
[time=3413] You may go to him in your trouble.
[time=3415] Run as a refuge, a high tower, a fortress.
[time=3420] If you don't run to him then friends, when can you run?
[time=3424] He is faithful.
[time=3428] Receive the benediction.
[time=3432] But as for you, dear church at Blackhawk, flee greediness, pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness and gentleness.
[time=3441] Fight the good fight of the faith.
[time=3443] Take hold of the eternal life to what you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
[time=3450] I charge you in the presence of God who gives life to all things and of Christ Jesus who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate
[time=3457] made the good confession to keep by God's grace the command unstained and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=3465] which he will display at the proper time.
[time=3467] He who was the blessed and only sovereign, the King of kings, the Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light,
[time=3474] who no one has ever seen or can see to him be honor and eternal dominion.
[time=3484] [AMEN] Grace be with you.
[time=3516] [MUSIC]
