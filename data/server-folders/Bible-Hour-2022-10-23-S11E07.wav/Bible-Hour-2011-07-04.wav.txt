[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] It's ringing in the skies, I can't until the night.
[time=37] The music of the universe plays.
[time=43] Singing you a holy you're great and my.
[time=48] The moon and the stars declare who you are.
[time=54] I'm so unworthy, still you love.
[time=59] Forever in my heart, we'll sing about the way you are.
[time=66] (upbeat music)
[time=73] All right, beautiful and free.
[time=76] Beautiful and free, the song of galaxies.
[time=81] Yeah, it's reaching far beyond the Milky Way.
[time=87] It's joining with the sound.
[time=90] Come on, let's sing it out.
[time=92] It's the music of the universe plays.
[time=97] Singing you a holy you're great and my.
[time=103] The moon and the stars declare who you are.
[time=109] I'm so unworthy, still you love.
[time=114] Forever in my heart, we'll sing about the way you are.
[time=121] (upbeat music) I'm gonna see all glory on our power.
[time=129] And all glory on our power is yours, amen.
[time=149] All glory on our power sing.
[time=152] And all glory on our power is yours, amen.
[time=170] Are you a holy singer?
[time=174] Singing you a holy you're great and mighty.
[time=180] The moon and the stars declare who you are.
[time=186] I'm so unworthy, still you love.
[time=191] Forever in my heart, we'll sing about the way you are.
[time=199] (upbeat music) (applause)
[time=212] (applause)
[time=218] Thanks Adam.
[time=219] (applause) It's so like you're hearing a thunder in the rain yesterday.
[time=224] And the wind.
[time=225] (upbeat music) I mentioned to you last Sunday that this is our first Sunday of the songs of summer.
[time=235] We're gonna spend a summer in the Psalms.
[time=238] The Psalms are songs.
[time=240] Songs written from by a musician to from his heart to the Lord.
[time=246] Something you might want to write down to kind of hover over our nine weeks in the Psalms to keep in mind about the Psalms.
[time=254] And before you write, let me give you one more thing to think about.
[time=257] I mentioned also to you last week that when we have trouble, when we are struggling, when we need encouragement, we need to be strengthened, we run to the Psalms.
[time=268] They are the most familiar passages in the whole Bible to us.
[time=272] And I can list them off for you one by one.
[time=276] Their familiarity can be a great blessing to us, or it can get in the way.
[time=281] So I would pray that this morning, and indeed each of the next nine weeks that were in the Psalms, that we would hear this from the Lord in a fresh and new way, and everything that's in our way from receiving it the right way would be removed.
[time=295] It's something to write down this morning to consider.
[time=299] The Psalms are inspired speech from man to God.
[time=307] Jesus said that David, as he spoke by the spirit in the Psalms, so Jesus was convinced that David only spoke by the Holy Spirit.
[time=316] The prophets, it isn't that way.
[time=318] The prophet says, "Thus says the Lord, and it drops like rain from the sky." But in the Psalms, it rises up.
[time=325] So the Psalms are inspired speech rising up from man to God.
[time=330] It's a very different way of receiving it.
[time=332] Look at verse 4 of Psalm 27.
[time=334] "I have asked, I will seek after that I may dwell.
[time=337] Let a first person pronounce." So I prayed that this morning, as we begin our summer in the Psalms with pastor Anthony Pettis, I prayed that we would receive God's word and the way it was meant to be received, and that we would have years to hear.
[time=355] Pastor Pettis is a good friend to this place.
[time=358] He's been a partner in the Logos Institute, a partner in the Leadership Summit, a very, very good friend to Kelly, a very good friend to this place.
[time=366] Would you please this morning, with grateful and thankful and open hearts?
[time=371] Welcome, Pastor Anthony Pettis from Beta Progressive this morning.
[time=374] [APPLAUSE]
[time=385] Good morning, good morning, good morning.
[time=389] It's a wonderful day to be saved.
[time=391] Good day, man. Certainly we thank God for another opportunity to be in this house.
[time=396] I never take for granted that I should be a church.
[time=399] It is because of the goodness of the Lord that we are here, and certainly I'm glad to see all of you here.
[time=404] And again, thankful for the opportunity to stand before you and share the word of God.
[time=409] Let's bow our heads in the word of prayer.
[time=412] Father, we thank You, Father.
[time=413] Your benefits told us, God, we thank You for this day.
[time=415] It's a day that You've made.
[time=416] I pray that You would help us to continually rejoice and be glad in it.
[time=420] We pray now, Lord, as the word goes forth, that You will speak to us.
[time=424] O God, and after speaking to us, I pray that You'd move us from being here as to doers.
[time=428] Allow Your word to go forth on restricted, unhindered, that it might accomplish that for which You set it forth.
[time=434] Blessed are the heroes, O God.
[time=436] O God, that they would hear with the intent to act on that which is heard.
[time=439] Bless us now in Jesus' name.
[time=441] [AMEN] Again, it is good to be here, and certainly I love Kelly very dearly.
[time=448] Dear friend, certainly praying that He and His family will take this time or rest to be refreshed.
[time=454] That He'll come back to take Black Hawk even yet to another level.
[time=458] [AMEN - 1 seconds] The book of Psalms, we are going to read Psalms 1, and I'm going to be reading from the King James Version.
[time=468] And if you have your mind, we'll read along with us.
[time=472] The text says, "Blessed is the man that walketh not in the Council of the ungodly." Nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the scornful.
[time=482] But His delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law, doth He meditate day and night.
[time=489] And He shall be like a tree, planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth His fruit in His season.
[time=496] His leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever He do, shall prosper.
[time=502] The ungodly are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind driveeth away.
[time=507] Therefore, the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
[time=513] For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
[time=520] For my lot of time today, I want to talk about how to live a blessed life.
[time=529] How to live a blessed life?
[time=534] I believe everyone here today says, "I want to be blessed.
[time=541] I want to have a blessed life.
[time=544] I want to live out a blessed life." And certainly, to know God is to know that God is the blessed sword.
[time=554] And when you look at the book of Psalms, you see Psalms 1.
[time=560] It opens up, interestingly, because it opens up with God blessing us.
[time=568] The last Psalm, the 150th Psalm, it closes with us blessing God.
[time=576] And I want you to think about that for a moment because, again, it opens in Psalms 1 with God blessing us.
[time=584] And then Psalm 150 closes out with us blessing God.
[time=590] In between God blessing us and us blessing God many things have transpired in the Psalms.
[time=602] There's been enemies, there's been danger, there's been trouble, there's been calamity, but there's also been rejoicing.
[time=609] There's been praise.
[time=610] There's been the Lord's protection, there's been the Lord's guidance.
[time=613] And the point of the book of Psalms is to encourage us as Psalm 1 suggests that God is blessing us and Psalm 150 closes with us blessing him.
[time=626] It all suggests that no matter what we go through in between him blessing us and us blessing him,
[time=634] the encouragement is that listen, we're going to get to the end where we bless God.
[time=640] In your life today, maybe you're at a time where you're saying things are not so blessed right now.
[time=649] With the craziness of the economy with things going on, the way they're going, when things happening, the way they're happening, you may be a victim of this downside economy.
[time=659] It was supposed to be up by now, things were supposed to be better.
[time=662] But the truth of the matter is, it's not better.
[time=665] So what do you do as a child of God?
[time=667] Well, I suggest that people listen.
[time=669] The number one I live in the kingdom of God and the kingdom does not play about the same rules that the world plays by.
[time=675] In other words, listen, heaven has never went bankrupt.
[time=679] And when I read my Bible, according to Scripture, Matthew chapter 6, starting at verse 25, he says this,
[time=690] "Take no thought for your life, what you should eat, what you should drink or what you should put on.
[time=693] For the same Lord who watches over the sparrows, who need the soul of no reap, is how much more will the heavenly Father take care of those that belong to him.
[time=700] And so if you're a child of God today, your worry shouldn't be the economy.
[time=706] We can get caught up in who should be in office and who shouldn't be in office and what the Democrats should do and what the Republicans should do.
[time=712] But as a child of God, my happiness is not contingent on who's in office.
[time=719] As a child of God, my happiness is not contingent on whether or not the Republicans win or the Democrats win.
[time=726] My happiness is found in God.
[time=730] And so I want to talk about this because everybody has an idea of what they think or what they believe happiness should consist of.
[time=739] But I remind you today, first of all, that happiness is an attribute of God.
[time=747] You came by it at Walmart.
[time=752] Macy's don't say all happiness.
[time=756] The restaurants are not serving happiness.
[time=760] It can only be found in God.
[time=763] And the text suggests, the text suggests that the person that's blessed, he's blessed first of all for what he does not do.
[time=776] And the truth of the matter is that this Psalm can be breaking down into two parts.
[time=781] It talks about the man who's blessed in verses one through three and in verses four through six, it talks about the person that's being judged or not blessed.
[time=790] Now, the good news is that God has given you the choice to choose whether you want to be blessed or whether you want to live the life of the ungodly.
[time=801] Now, I've been the Blackhawk several times at the Leadership Summit and I've been here on a couple of other different services.
[time=809] And so I'm familiar with some of you, but most of you, I don't know.
[time=814] And that's okay because the word is the word.
[time=820] See how you say it, amen?
[time=822] Keep that up.
[time=826] You know, and I'll tell you this, I just like to keep it real, I like to be who I am.
[time=831] The Baptist Church, we tell them you'll talk back, talk back.
[time=834] And I tell people this, see, when you say amen, that just means so let it be.
[time=840] When you look at me, I'm thinking they don't understand what I'm saying, so that I add another 20 minutes to the sermon.
[time=849] Because my responsibility is to make sure you leave here and you got it.
[time=855] So if you look at me like, "Ah, he's speaking Greek to me." You know, I add another couple minutes to the sermon because I don't have to figure out how to get you to understand what I'm trying to get you to understand.
[time=864] But the text suggests, the man is blessed for what he does not do.
[time=870] And again, that word blessed, as sure in the Hebrew, it literally means to be happy.
[time=877] Who does not want to be happy?
[time=882] But you know what I've discovered?
[time=884] Most people go after happiness the wrong way.
[time=889] Some people think that happiness is finding the right man or the right woman.
[time=895] Some people think that happiness is having the perfect job.
[time=900] Some people think that happiness is living in the house that you've always dreamed of, or driving the car that you've always wanted to have.
[time=907] But again, I'm saying to you, happiness is an attribute of God.
[time=912] And so it's quite natural that if you don't have God, you don't have happiness.
[time=916] And one of the things I've discovered is that oftentimes, listen, when we seek happiness from other human beings, we get disappointed.
[time=926] When a man loves a woman, he says, "You make me happy."
[time=935] And when a woman loves a man, she says, "Oh, he just makes me so happy.
[time=939] I just want to spend the rest of my life with him, oh God." But we all know that that fairy tale don't last.
[time=949] It doesn't last.
[time=959] Because it turns into pick up the socks off the floor.
[time=962] Why don't you take out the garbage?
[time=964] You're going to cook.
[time=967] And if you're not careful, you'll look for happiness in other people, even the person that you're with.
[time=974] And when you don't find it, you know what you'll say, "Well, they don't make me happy anymore, and we don't have any peace in this house anymore."
[time=983] But when you talk about happiness and peace, those are attributes of God, and only he can give them.
[time=988] And the truth of the matter is, is that God has placed two yearnings in every one of us.
[time=993] Two yearnings in every one of us.
[time=995] There's a yearning that a man has for a woman, and a woman has for a man, but there's also a yearning for God.
[time=1002] We are considered a tricotomy, body, soul, and spirit.
[time=1009] And what's this?
[time=1011] The soul that I have, the Bible says also is a mindset, the Lord of hosts.
[time=1014] And so my soul belongs to God, and it yearns to be with him.
[time=1018] The problem is, is that many people get these two yearnings mixed up.
[time=1023] And so what happens is, I started looking for my wife to make me happy, and when she disappoints me, I'm not happy.
[time=1031] And when I start saying, "I'm unhappy," check this out.
[time=1036] It's not because it's my wife's fault, it's my soul missing God.
[time=1042] I'm gonna rewind that and play it again. Somebody didn't catch me, I'm gonna say it again.
[time=1049] I'm gonna hit the rewind button, I'm gonna play that again.
[time=1052] So the two yearnings I have, one is a natural yearning a man has for a woman, and a woman has for a man.
[time=1057] The other yearning is, is a yearning for God. That's in every one of us.
[time=1061] And if I'm not careful, I'll get those two yearnings mixed up.
[time=1065] And I'll say, "I ain't happy no more.
[time=1069] I'm going downtown to get my divorce. I ain't happy." And what you're saying is, is that there's an absence of God because only He can bring you happiness.
[time=1082] Your mate was never designed to make you happy. In fact, there's, there's a book by Gary Thomas called "The Sacred Marriage."
[time=1090] And what he says in the book is this, he says God didn't give us relationships to make us happy.
[time=1099] He gave us relationships to make us holy.
[time=1104] I was like, "Wow!" Even in Genesis, when God looked at Adam and it wasn't an afterthought, but he says, "Listen, it's not good for a man to be alone.
[time=1113] God made us to be in relationship with other people, but He gave us relationships to make us holy, and so happiness is something that I want.
[time=1121] I need it. I've got to have it. But again, I've got to understand it can only come from God.
[time=1126] And so, watch this. So happy is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standing in the way of sinners, nor sitting in the seat of the throne.
[time=1141] Look at the progression. He goes from walking to standing to sitting.
[time=1151] Let's look at the text. Walk if not in the counsel of the ungodly. What is God trying to say to us?
[time=1160] I'll tell you what he's trying to say. He's trying to say that every one of us, even as believers, we need to take a good inventory of ourselves and ask ourselves the question, are there some people in my life that I don't need to be walking with?
[time=1180] Sometimes, when you come out the world and you get saved, you have a tendency to have one foot in the world and the other foot looking at Jesus in the church.
[time=1192] And then the world says, "Psssssss, he's a-huh." And you look at the world and then you go, "Oh God, I've got to go back to God."
[time=1200] And the point is this, is that sometimes it's because of the fellowships that we have that keep us entangled in worldly dispositions.
[time=1212] In the Bible, in 2 Corinthians chapter 6, verse 14 says, it says, "Be not unequally yoked with non-believers.
[time=1226] For what fellowship does light have with darkness? What fellowship does Satan have with the devil?"
[time=1234] In all of the biblical history of the life of Jesus, you never heard him say, "A-a-a-a, Satan, man, let's hang out."
[time=1242] What you doing tonight? Let's hang. Can we kick it?
[time=1248] Why don't you come over, let's do lunch. You never heard him, because there's no fellowship between the two, because Christ is light, and listen, and light dispels darkness.
[time=1259] And what he says as a believer in Jesus Christ, listen, I have to make the act of decision, listen, that I can't walk with everybody.
[time=1270] Now you may think that's discriminatory, but the fact is, is that if you're going to live a happy life, there's some people that you've got to learn to walk away from.
[time=1277] If they're not headed in the direction you're headed in, if they don't love the same Lord that you love, listen, you've got to learn to walk away.
[time=1288] In fact, years ago I read Bill Hywell and then Hywell's book, "Fifty be Ty."
[time=1296] And in the book, he has a section on spiritual compatibility.
[time=1303] And within that spiritual compatibility piece, he suggests that, you know what, if you're going to hook up, get with somebody, marry somebody, be with somebody, you need to first of all share the same Lord.
[time=1318] But you also need to have the same, and he says is you have to have the common Lord, the common values, common blueprint, and common strength.
[time=1332] And what he says is, is that if you're not sharing the same Lord, he says, think about this.
[time=1338] You marry somebody that don't share the same Lord, or you with somebody who doesn't share the same Lord.
[time=1343] And the Bible suggests this, that I shouldn't be walking in the Council of the Ungodly, because when I walk in the Council of the Ungodly, those who are ungodly, if I keep walking with them, you know, listen, the tendency is, is I'll start standing with them.
[time=1358] Walking suggests progress, but it's progress in the wrong direction.
[time=1363] And if I hang out with the wrong people and go in the wrong direction long enough, they'll have me standing around.
[time=1369] The text that's standing in the way of sinners, that doesn't mean I'm in the way.
[time=1373] That means I'm with them, I'm standing and hanging out now with sinners.
[time=1377] And then when you start hanging out with sinners, the text goes on to say this, nor sit it in the seat of the gospel.
[time=1383] That means to be in the seat sitting around with people that's mockers.
[time=1387] He ever ran into a person that ain't nothing ever right.
[time=1394] He ever ran into a Christian that nothing's right about the church.
[time=1400] The point is this, when you sit in the seat of the scornful, when you start sitting, that means you become comfortable with sin.
[time=1411] And as a child of God, he says, that's not the way to live a happy life.
[time=1416] He says to live a happy life, what you have to understand is that you can't walk with everybody.
[time=1421] The those who are young, who are in school, there's always peer pressure to run with certain crowds.
[time=1433] But as a young person in Jesus Christ, you've got to differentiate and discern who you can walk with and who you cannot walk with.
[time=1447] I'm sure that if you look hard enough, you'll discover they don't talk the same way I talk.
[time=1457] They're not into the same things I'm into.
[time=1460] So as a young person, especially in our world today, listen, Satan wants, this is what Jesus told Peter.
[time=1466] He says, Peter, Satan desires us 50 years a week.
[time=1469] He says, but I prayed for you. He says that your faith will fail now.
[time=1472] He says, and when you are strengthened, strengthen your brother. And so I want to suggest to you that as a believer in Jesus Christ, once you make that decision to accept Christ as your Savior, you can't walk with everybody.
[time=1484] Some folks, you've got to let go.
[time=1488] You remember Abraham?
[time=1491] You remember when God told him he was going to have a child, Sarah laughed, didn't believe it.
[time=1500] They was getting old.
[time=1502] Sarah said, hey, hey, hey, hey, look, you know I'm too old.
[time=1510] I can't handle, baby.
[time=1513] But I got Hagar right there.
[time=1516] You better go on and do what you need to do.
[time=1522] He listens.
[time=1525] Hagar brings Ishmael forth.
[time=1529] Now, Hagar and Ishmael in the house, Abraham loved her.
[time=1539] Now she poking fun at Sarah.
[time=1541] I got a baby, you don't have one.
[time=1544] Finally, God delivers.
[time=1546] Like he said, he would.
[time=1550] Now, Hagar still messing with Sarah.
[time=1554] Yeah, you got a baby, but I had mine first.
[time=1560] Sarah goes to Abraham, Abraham.
[time=1564] Hagar and Ishmael, they got to go.
[time=1568] The Bible says Abraham loves Sarah.
[time=1572] Watch this.
[time=1573] So now he goes to God.
[time=1575] Strange thing.
[time=1577] He came down to getting Hagar pregnant.
[time=1580] He didn't say nothing to God.
[time=1582] He was all for it.
[time=1584] But now Hagar, you know, Sarah said, they got to go.
[time=1589] And Hagar, Abraham goes to God.
[time=1592] I think God had a proverbial sense of humor right here.
[time=1596] Because God says, hey, Abraham.
[time=1599] I'll tell you how I want to say it.
[time=1601] Abraham, you didn't talk to me the first time.
[time=1604] You listened to your wife the first time.
[time=1606] You listened to her now.
[time=1607] They got to go.
[time=1611] The story is simple.
[time=1614] Ishmael and Isaac, they fight until this day.
[time=1619] But whose land it is?
[time=1621] All because they got away from doing what God said.
[time=1624] And the point is this, as a child of God, there comes a time where I got to make the choice of who I'm going to follow.
[time=1632] And I got to make the choice of who, you know, I don't need in my life.
[time=1637] Who are the people that I don't need in my life that are not headed in the same direction?
[time=1641] Let me keep rolling.
[time=1643] Next I'll bore you.
[time=1644] Hey, nudge your neighbors.
[time=1646] Hey, don't go to sleep yet.
[time=1650] So when you look at the text, I'm blessed.
[time=1655] I'm happy because I'm not walking in the council of ungodly.
[time=1659] I'm not standing with sinners.
[time=1661] I'm not sitting in the seat of the council.
[time=1665] But then verse two comes up.
[time=1668] And I want to spend the bulk of my time here on verse two.
[time=1672] He says this.
[time=1674] But his delight is in the law of the Lord.
[time=1679] And in his law that he meditate day and night.
[time=1685] Verse one, he's blessed for what he doesn't do.
[time=1691] Within the realm of verse two, he suggests number one, he says this.
[time=1699] His delight is in the law of the Lord.
[time=1702] In order for me to live a blessed life, I have to delight in the Word.
[time=1716] You know, that was the time in my life why I just hated to read.
[time=1727] One that I couldn't read, I just didn't like reading.
[time=1730] And then God called me to preach.
[time=1735] He's like, hey, you know, if you're going to preach for me, you've got to read.
[time=1740] So I start reading.
[time=1743] I never shall forget this.
[time=1746] I went to the first national convention, and I heard all of these great preachers.
[time=1752] And I walked out of there with my head down saying, man, I ain't preaching nothing.
[time=1759] Where are they getting all this stuff?
[time=1761] I got the same Bible they got, but they're getting more out of it than I'm getting.
[time=1765] And so I said, hey, where are they getting all this stuff?
[time=1768] And here comes again, you've got to read.
[time=1771] And I'm like, OK, read what?
[time=1773] Get you some books, learn you some words.
[time=1775] I said, OK, get some books, but what books?
[time=1780] And so I went back to my church kind of disgruntled.
[time=1784] Because I'm like, I've got to do better.
[time=1787] And so I started reading more.
[time=1788] And then I finally went to a conference that shared with me an exposition of preaching and how to execute the text.
[time=1794] And I started learning, you know, different disciplines of study.
[time=1798] And now I love the word.
[time=1804] Now I says, I don't study to preach.
[time=1808] I study to live.
[time=1810] And I preach from my living.
[time=1814] And there is a difference.
[time=1817] You know, as a child of God, I go to the Word of God for me.
[time=1822] Even this song that I'm preaching today, I got it first.
[time=1827] I caught it.
[time=1829] Every now and then, God wants you to evaluate the people you have around you in your circle.
[time=1836] Every now and then, you have to take inventory and say, I don't need this person, but I need this person.
[time=1844] But then the other side of it is, is that I've got to learn how, listen, to delight in the Word.
[time=1851] In the Beatitudes in Matthew chapter 5, Jesus says this.
[time=1854] He says, blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness is just for they shall be filled.
[time=1859] 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 1, he says this.
[time=1863] Listen, he says, as newborn babes, desire, listen, the sincere milk
[time=1870] of the Word that you may grow there by.
[time=1873] As a child of God, you know, many people know that it takes the right kind of nutrition for a child to grow up to be healthy and strong.
[time=1881] But sometimes as Christians, we don't see the need, listen, to eat healthy.
[time=1886] Oprah's okay.
[time=1891] Dr. Fields, okay.
[time=1894] Dr. Oz, okay.
[time=1896] But they're not Jesus.
[time=1899] They're not the Word of God.
[time=1901] And some people pay more attention to that kind of stuff they need to do God's Word.
[time=1905] And if I'm going to live a happy life, I've got to understand it has to be me, listen, delighting in the Word.
[time=1912] I've got to be passionate.
[time=1913] I have to listen, take pleasure in the Word of God.
[time=1918] Now, I don't know where you are in your walk with God.
[time=1920] I don't know where you are in your study of the Word of God.
[time=1923] But you know what I've discovered?
[time=1924] Sometimes, in fact, there was a study done back in the 90s that suggested that the average Christian only read their Bible 10 minutes a week.
[time=1934] Some people, the only time they read their Bible is when the preacher stands up and say, if you have your Bibles, would you turn to Psalms 1?
[time=1940] And they read it, and they get it in service, and then after they get it in service, whoop, life goes on.
[time=1946] But if you want a happy life, you have to learn how to delight in the Word of God.
[time=1951] I love the Word.
[time=1955] I love the Word of God.
[time=1958] Some would suggest, well, you know, this is your preacher.
[time=1961] No, I love the Word of God for me as a person.
[time=1966] Because before I was preacher-pedis, I was Anthony-pedis.
[time=1971] And I realize this, listen, preacher-pedis is what God called me to do, but why says Anthony-pedis has to get up every morning and face this world.
[time=1981] And within the realm of a day, many things can happen, but I've got to take pleasure in the Word.
[time=1986] And so I've got to delight in the Word of God.
[time=1988] If you're going to live a happy life, you've got to learn how to delight in the Word of God.
[time=1994] The next part of the verse says this.
[time=1999] And in his law, Duffy meditate day and night.
[time=2011] If I'm going to live a happy and blessed life, listen, I have to be disciplined to meditate on the Word.
[time=2022] God be disciplined.
[time=2029] Discipline is not foreign to any of us.
[time=2031] We understand what it is.
[time=2032] There are certain disciplines that we practice on a daily basis.
[time=2036] The truth of the matter is, is that I've got to get that way with the Word of God.
[time=2041] How many people want to be successful?
[time=2044] It's not a trick question.
[time=2047] So those you didn't raise your hand, you don't want to be successful?
[time=2052] You don't want to be?
[time=2055] I don't want to.
[time=2060] Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.
[time=2064] But there's two types of success.
[time=2068] There is the world success, and then there's the success of the believer.
[time=2073] In Joshua chapter 1, verse 8, I'm going to paraphrase it.
[time=2079] Well, watch what the text says.
[time=2081] Watch what it says.
[time=2084] God tells Joshua, hey, Joshua, take this book of the law.
[time=2088] Take the Word.
[time=2090] Here's that word again.
[time=2091] Meditate.
[time=2093] Win day and night.
[time=2096] And then what?
[time=2097] Absorbed to do what's written within.
[time=2098] And then what?
[time=2099] And then that way shall be prosperous, and then thou shall have good success.
[time=2104] You see, when you're saved, your success is in your meditation.
[time=2112] Oh, the Word of God.
[time=2116] Yeah.
[time=2117] He says, observe to do that.
[time=2119] I mean, listen, none of us can keep the Word.
[time=2121] That's why Jesus had to come, because none of us can keep the law at all.
[time=2125] So Jesus comes, he saves us, but he tells us, listen.
[time=2128] Our blessedness, our happiness is meditating.
[time=2131] It comes through meditating on the Word of God day and night.
[time=2135] Every morning, every evening.
[time=2138] Now, if you're not at that point in your life, where you're meditating on the Word of God day and night, daily, guess what?
[time=2148] You got work to do, but I'm too busy.
[time=2154] I've got too much going on in my life.
[time=2156] That's the very reason why you need to meditate on the Word day and night.
[time=2161] Because you're a success as a believer.
[time=2164] Let me do this real quick.
[time=2165] Let me do this.
[time=2166] See, let me help you understand what happens when you get saved.
[time=2170] 1 Corinthians 6, verse 19, it says, what?
[time=2173] No, you're not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which you have of God.
[time=2177] What's this?
[time=2178] And you are not your own.
[time=2179] All right?
[time=2180] That's what the Bible says.
[time=2182] 1 Corinthians 6, 19.
[time=2184] You are not your own.
[time=2185] Verse 20 says, 4, you're bought with the price.
[time=2189] Therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are gods.
[time=2194] So, guess what?
[time=2196] When I get saved, I lose ownership of myself.
[time=2200] God owns me.
[time=2203] The good news of that is, is this.
[time=2205] Because God owns me, he's bound to provide for me.
[time=2210] In fact, look at it this way.
[time=2213] What has God owned that he has not taken care of?
[time=2219] Oh, amen.
[time=2222] Matthew 6, 25, take no thought for your life.
[time=2226] What's your eat?
[time=2227] What's your drink?
[time=2228] What you should prolong?
[time=2229] The same law that watches over the sparrows who need a sore up, no reap.
[time=2233] How much more will he take care of you?
[time=2236] When is the last time you've seen a bird punch a clock?
[time=2239] When is the last time you've seen a bird in the unemployment office fill it out of application?
[time=2251] God takes people like you and me.
[time=2254] Go on to the grocery store.
[time=2256] Mind 40 pounds of birds, so you've got to feed the birds.
[time=2261] The lilies of the field, God clothed them.
[time=2266] And what I'm saying to you today is this.
[time=2268] Is that because we don't own ourselves, we got to understand this.
[time=2273] It's not up to us to provide for ourselves.
[time=2275] It's God's job.
[time=2278] And I come to tell you today, he's been a good steward with my life.
[time=2283] Listen, in spite of me, you'll catch that on the way out the door.
[time=2289] See, I don't profess to be this holy, sanctimonious.
[time=2292] I thank God I'm saved, sanctified field that I don't see.
[time=2295] That ain't me.
[time=2298] I live on earth.
[time=2300] I live life in reality.
[time=2303] I've made mistakes.
[time=2306] Yes, you have to.
[time=2312] The point is this.
[time=2313] I belong to God.
[time=2314] And because God owns me, listen, it's his responsibility to provide for me.
[time=2318] How does he provide for me?
[time=2319] He tells me this is what you need to do.
[time=2324] Matthew chapter 6 verse 33.
[time=2326] "But seek ye first the kingdom of God in his righteousness." He says, "And all these other things will be added unto you." But isn't it true that that's what everybody's chasing after things?
[time=2336] And watch this.
[time=2338] And when you can't kiss the things you're chasing, it disappoints you.
[time=2341] But God says you can be happy by meditating.
[time=2344] Listen, on the word.
[time=2347] You'll have a happy life if you're disciplined to meditate on the word day and night.
[time=2357] You mean to tell me I can be successful?
[time=2359] I can be prosperous because of the fact that I meditate on the word?
[time=2362] Yes.
[time=2363] So I don't have to go to work?
[time=2365] No, that's not what I'm saying.
[time=2369] What I'm saying is your prosperity and your success is wrapped up in your meditation in the Word of God.
[time=2374] You see, in Scripture, you understand this.
[time=2382] Romans 8 and 28 says this, "We know that all things work together for the good of them who love God who are called according to his purpose." Right?
[time=2391] The Scripture says.
[time=2393] What God does, he uses a synergistic effort.
[time=2399] Synergy is when two different elements come together.
[time=2402] All right?
[time=2403] And what God does, he takes the good and bad of life and synergistically works it out for our good.
[time=2408] So don't ask me how he does it, but I know he does.
[time=2411] I've experienced some bad situations in my life that turned out for my good.
[time=2416] In other words, when I'm trying to suggest to you as this as a child of God, meditate on the word.
[time=2422] You know, the older I get, the more I understand this.
[time=2427] What's going to get me through is the Word of God.
[time=2430] What's going to keep me sane is the Word of God.
[time=2436] What's going to keep me walking upright, loving my fellow man like he commands, is me standing the Word.
[time=2443] Because let me take you to truth.
[time=2445] The truth of the matter is, if you take me away from the Word, I'm a whole different fellow.
[time=2454] You are too though.
[time=2458] This indels me for one moment.
[time=2460] Just grab your skin right quick.
[time=2463] Just get your little piece of skin.
[time=2468] And I'm going to encourage you to talk to yourself right now.
[time=2470] It's okay.
[time=2472] We all going to talk to ourselves.
[time=2475] Say, "Self"?
[time=2478] Ain't nothing good in here.
[time=2486] In my flesh, 12, if no good thing.
[time=2490] In fact, Galatians 5, 16 says this.
[time=2495] He says, "Walk in the spirit so that you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh.
[time=2501] For the flesh and the spirit, they are contrary to one another so that you cannot do the things that you should." Now, that's just now.
[time=2511] There's a story of an old Indian chief who's talking to a little Indian boy and he says to the little boy, he says, "Son, every man has two dogs in him." He says, "And those two dogs are always fighting." And the little boy asks the question.
[time=2532] He says, "Chief, which one wins?" He says, "The one you feed the most."
[time=2545] There is my flesh and there's my spirit.
[time=2549] Which one wins is up to you?
[time=2552] Whichever one you feed the most, if you feed your flesh the most, your flesh is going to win out.
[time=2559] And then wants this, your happiness will be gone.
[time=2563] But if you feed your spirit, man, through meditating on the Word of God, and I encourage you as a child of God, if you're not doing it, you know, get into the Word of God.
[time=2574] It is your lifeline.
[time=2575] It is where your real happiness and peace is.
[time=2578] If you're in the Word of God, encourage somebody else, "Hey, you know what this Word is working for me." But the truth of the matter is, is that he says, "I can have this blessed life by meditating on the Word of God." Now, as you look at this song, verse one teaches me that I can live a happy life when I'm not walking in the Council of the Ungodly, when I'm not standing in the way of sinners, and when I'm not sitting in the seat of the scornful.
[time=2608] Verse two teaches me, here's what it teaches me.
[time=2612] It teaches me that I can live a happy life by delighting in the Word and secondly being disciplined in the Word.
[time=2621] And as a result of beat practicing, verses one and two, verse three comes in.
[time=2630] The text says this, "And ye shall be like a tree."
[time=2636] You know, I grew up with schoolhouse rock, conjunction, junction,
[time=2642] what's your function?
[time=2645] Some of the youngsters, y'all don't know what that is.
[time=2649] But I grew up watching it, and I learned that and is a joining clause.
[time=2654] And the and in verse three joins, verse three would verses one and two.
[time=2659] And if I can practice verses one and two, not walking, not standing,
[time=2666] not sitting, delighting in being disciplined in the Word of God, then verse three is the result of what I'll do in verse one and two.
[time=2676] The text says this, "And ye shall be like a tree, planet by the river of the water."
[time=2687] See that in the text?
[time=2690] Let me just look at this real quick.
[time=2693] It endows me, "He shall be like a tree, planet by the river of the water."
[time=2700] All right?
[time=2702] And so if I'm planet, listen, by the river of the water, that suggests this.
[time=2714] Planet suggests that I have power.
[time=2716] The river of water suggests provision.
[time=2720] A tree that's planted by the river of water never has to worry about being fed.
[time=2725] All right? And again, as this tree is fed, its planet, which means it's rooted.
[time=2735] Now let me suggest this to you.
[time=2737] Black Hawk is the river.
[time=2744] Listen, that word "planet" in the Hebrew is in the passive voice, which suggests this.
[time=2751] The passive voice suggests that you're a recipient of the action, which means this, I didn't plant myself.
[time=2758] God planted me.
[time=2760] Those of you that are here at Black Hawk and you're members of Black Hawk, God planted you here.
[time=2764] Why? Because there's a river here flowing.
[time=2769] And that's where you get your provisions from this river that flows.
[time=2774] But being this tree planet suggests that you're powerful and the river suggests, listen, it suggests provision.
[time=2784] But watch this.
[time=2786] The text says that it shall bring forth this fruit in its season.
[time=2793] When you are powerfully planted and provided for, you will produce.
[time=2802] Understand this.
[time=2805] A tree that's in the right spot will always bloom and produce.
[time=2810] And the point is this.
[time=2813] That's one of the signs of a blessed and happy life.
[time=2819] You're being productive.
[time=2822] And listen, you're being productive for the kingdom of God.
[time=2828] As a child of God, one of the things I ask of myself and question of myself,
[time=2836] what kind of fruit am I producing?
[time=2839] Am I producing fruit that will last?
[time=2841] Even as a shepherd, I ask myself all the time.
[time=2844] As I study and as I preach and teach the word of God to my congregation week after week, what kind of fruit is it producing?
[time=2853] And you got to ask yourself the question, as I meditate in the word of God, as I get into the word, what am I producing?
[time=2863] If I'm not bearing fruit, John 15 passes.
[time=2867] Either bear or not fruit, the text says he take it away.
[time=2871] And he that bear fruit, he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit.
[time=2875] Many people think that, you know, and the thought have been, okay, if I'm not bearing fruit, God is going to take me away.
[time=2881] No, no, no.
[time=2882] Understand what Jesus is talking about.
[time=2884] He's talking about vineyards.
[time=2885] And he's talking about grapes.
[time=2887] And understand that grapes in order to grow.
[time=2891] Listen, they have to be propped up.
[time=2893] And so take it away.
[time=2894] And also on the Greek little it means to lift up out of.
[time=2897] In other words, if you're not producing fruit, it's because you're down in the dirt.
[time=2901] And why says when grapes are covered with dirt, they cannot be exposed to the sun.
[time=2905] And so they won't ripen.
[time=2907] And the truth of the matter is, is that what Jesus does and what he's done, listen, Jesus came along and picked you and I up, up out of the dirt.
[time=2915] He cleaned us off and, and exposed us to himself.
[time=2919] Now watch this.
[time=2920] Now he says, he that bringing forth fruit, he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit.
[time=2925] Purge it means he cuts.
[time=2926] Why does God cut on me?
[time=2928] Well, watch this.
[time=2929] If you know anything about grapes, you ever been to the store and you tasted some grapes, you know, how you going to check them out for you vine, you know.
[time=2936] You pinch one off to see if it's sweet.
[time=2938] Nobody does that, huh?
[time=2941] You pinch it off to see if it's sweet.
[time=2943] And watch this.
[time=2944] Have you ever had a great, look real good, but the sours all get out?
[time=2948] Can I tell you why?
[time=2949] Because there's only so much sugar content in a vine.
[time=2953] Hear me good.
[time=2955] And if there's too many branches on the vine, the sugar will be spreaded out so thin that the grapes won't be sweet.
[time=2961] And so God has to cut on you.
[time=2963] Watch this so he can sweeten you upside.
[time=2968] See that's some stuff.
[time=2969] Can I just be honest with you?
[time=2970] That's some stuff God had to cut off for me.
[time=2972] Listen, because there was some day that I was sour.
[time=2976] You ever seen a sour Christian?
[time=2980] I'm going to keep moving.
[time=2982] My time is about out anyway.
[time=2984] But what I'm trying to suggest to you is this.
[time=2986] Listen, you got to understand that he says he will produce fruit in his season.
[time=2993] You see, whenever you're a planet, you'll bring forth fruit at the right time.
[time=2997] The text says, "And his leaves shall not wither." That means this.
[time=3003] The best person, the happy person, the person that's living out of happy life, you don't have to worry about any breast or leaf withering on you.
[time=3012] Why?
[time=3013] Because you're a planet by the rivers of water, you're steadily being fed.
[time=3017] And here's a lot of part of the text.
[time=3019] A lot of part of the text says, "And whatsoever you do with, shall prosper." I don't know how you feel, but that's good news to me.
[time=3028] Verses four through six, it talks about the person that's judged, the ungodly.
[time=3033] And so I didn't want to spend time a whole lot of time on the negativity of the ungodly, because again, my prayer is that those of you that are here today, you're all saved.
[time=3042] And you consider yourself a godly Christian.
[time=3045] But the truth of the matter is that even in my walk with God, I've got to realize, listen, that I'll always be taking inventory and making sure I've got the right people in your life, because let me tell you this.
[time=3057] The devil is always looking for a way to come at you.
[time=3063] Finally, my brother, in Hebrews 6, 10, "Be strongly alone in the powers of might, put on the whole arm of God that you may be able to stand against the wives of the devil.
[time=3070] For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against the rulers of the doctors of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[time=3077] Can I just tell you something? You are at war. If you are saved, you are at war with the devil.
[time=3082] You can't walk around like, "Oh, you know what? The devil ain't bothering me.
[time=3087] Listen, if you're saved, you're at war." 24/7, he's looking to eat you up.
[time=3094] And that's why you got to meditate on the Word of God so you can stay strong.
[time=3098] You got to keep your arm and shine up and polished.
[time=3101] You got to make sure as a child of God, listen, that you're getting in your Word.
[time=3105] You're studying every day. You know, we got this Lagos Institute, you know, and I'm wondering, I'm wondering, I'm wondering, I'm wondering, I know what's happening in my location.
[time=3116] It started out with a big bang, but you can see the interest of people in the Word of God.
[time=3120] They just start to wane off. And I'm wondering, you know, is it a packed crowd?
[time=3125] You know, it's Bible study. It's the Word of God being presented and brought to you in a way
[time=3132] that consists, that happens at seminaries at a fraction of the cost.
[time=3137] And some people say, "Well, you know, I don't need to pay for the Word.
[time=3142] Listen, you pay for everything else you have." Amen, lights.
[time=3149] And what I'm saying is this, as a preacher, and I'm done.
[time=3153] I'll see you have 40 seconds here.
[time=3156] Listen to me good.
[time=3159] One of my main drives is to get God's people into the Word of God.
[time=3169] It's not enough that your preacher knows it. You've got to know it for you.
[time=3174] Because at the end of the day, your preacher won't stand at judgment with you.
[time=3180] He'll be standing for himself, and you'll have to stand for yourself.
[time=3183] So let me encourage you. Let me encourage you.
[time=3186] Listen, get into the Word of God.
[time=3192] You do nothing else. Make the Word of God a priority in your life.
[time=3196] Don't put the Word of God on the back shelf with a back burner.
[time=3199] Don't say, "I don't have time to study the Bible." Because if you've got time to study business and everything else, and if you have time to go to school and study to get a degree, then you should make time because God is a jealous God.
[time=3212] But here's the real reason why I'm saying all of what I'm saying.
[time=3215] You know what I'm saying is? Because you can have a happy life,
[time=3221] which is what everybody's chasing after.
[time=3224] Everybody wants to be happy. And God says, "You can be happy by what you don't do,
[time=3230] by way of walking, standing, and sitting, and what you do do by delighting and being disciplined in the Word of God." All right, I'm done.
[time=3239] [APPLAUSE]
[time=3247] Listen, I never am in a service where I do not offer the invitation to receive Christ.
[time=3258] If you're here today and you have not received Christ, the truth of the matter is Psalm 1 puts you in verses 4 through 6.
[time=3268] But the good news is that you can move out of verses 4 through 6
[time=3274] just by accepting Christ as your Savior.
[time=3277] You can jump into verses 1 through 3 just by saying, "Lord, save me."
[time=3283] Just by admitting that you've sinned, just by believing that he died for your sins and then confessing that God is raised from the dead.
[time=3290] According to Romans 10 to 9, the Bible says, "Thou shalt be saved." So if you're here today and you can say, "You know what?
[time=3298] I'm not saved, but I want to be saved." All you have to do is say, "Lord, I admit that I'm sinned.
[time=3304] Lord, I believe that you die for my sins.
[time=3307] I confess that you have raised Jesus from the dead.
[time=3311] Lord, come into my life and save me." If you really mean that prayer, you can be saved right now.
[time=3317] You can move out of verse 4 to 6 and jump into verse 1 through 3.
[time=3322] That's good news.
[time=3325] That is good news because everybody wants to be happy.
[time=3330] And the person that says, "I don't want to be happy, they're really deceiving themselves." So I encourage you, if you're not saved, don't leave out of here and not save today.
[time=3341] I'm sure that there's counselors waiting.
[time=3343] If you want to be saved, you can be saved.
[time=3346] I know it's a room around there somewhere.
[time=3348] I know it's around there.
[time=3351] If you want to be saved, you can be saved.
[time=3356] In closing, let me suggest this to you.
[time=3361] If you're not engaged in the Word of God on a daily basis, you're robbing yourself of happiness
[time=3373] because that's where it is.
[time=3375] Let's pray.
[time=3379] Father, we thank you for all of your benefits towards us again.
[time=3382] We thank you for this time that we've had to share with this congregation.
[time=3387] Lord, we pray for Pastor Kelly and his entire family.
[time=3393] That while they're away from the congregation, that you'll give them rest.
[time=3398] That you'll replenish, that you'll revive, that you'll restore.
[time=3402] We pray that you keep your hand around his entire family.
[time=3407] We pray, Lord God, that as he returns back to the fold, that you will reinvigorate him so much so
[time=3417] that he'll take Black Hawk even to higher levels.
[time=3421] I pray for the congregation as he's away from them.
[time=3424] I pray that their faith and their faithfulness to the ministry will remain strong.
[time=3430] I pray, O God, that you would bless the sheep while the shepherd's away.
[time=3436] You've entrusted this congregation to hands, and I pray, O God, that they would rightly divide a word of truth that this flock will continually be fed.
[time=3445] And then, Lord, I pray for those here today who are in need of you.
[time=3451] There's somebody who's seeking you desperately.
[time=3454] There's somebody that's going through a hard trial right now that needs you.
[time=3457] And I'm glad you said in your Word that you know with what we have need of even before we ask you.
[time=3462] And so I pray that you would meet your people where they are, continue to bless us, allow
[time=3468] us to leave this place, Lord God, with your word and our hearts and minds, and help us to move from being heroes to being doers, that we may bring you glory through our lifestyle.
[time=3479] Thank you again for all that you've done and all that you're yet going to do in our lives, and in the life of this ministry, and in the life of Pastor Kelly and his family.
[time=3487] In the name of Jesus, we pray we ask it all.
[time=3490] [AMEN] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
