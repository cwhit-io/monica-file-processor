[time=2121] That's a way to meditate.
[time=2123] It's not rocket science, friends.
[time=2126] Meditation is focus.
[time=2127] It's my aim.
[time=2128] It's my effort.
[time=2129] It's what I'm shooting for.
[time=2131] What are you watching on television?
[time=2133] 'Cause your kids are watching you watch.
[time=2136] And what you love, you're gonna watch.
[time=2139] There is a lot of garbage to watch.
[time=2142] A lot of good stuff too.
[time=2144] What are you watching?
[time=2145] What are you reading?
[time=2149] What magazines do you read?
[time=2150] What books do you read?
[time=2152] Are you feeding your soul?
[time=2154] That's meditation.
[time=2156] It's focusing in what I listen to, what I watch and what I read.
[time=2159] It's not legalism.
[time=2160] That's worship.
[time=2161] Don't see it as that.
[time=2164] Don't, don't, don't.
[time=2166] See it as do.
[time=2167] See it as obedience.
[time=2168] See it as fostering in your kids and in your spouse or in yourself, a love for what is true and good and right and beautiful and perfect.
[time=2176] That's how you should see it.
[time=2177] Buy music that will fill your heart and your soul with praise for him.
[time=2182] Get books.
[time=2183] Please see me after service if you want some recommendations.
[time=2186] Books that will fill your heart and your soul and make you ask good questions and find good answers to those questions.
[time=2198] What are you honing in on to make other things clear?
[time=2201] What's the lens that you're using?
[time=2204] Get good lenses and work in your relationships and your family with your money, with your worship.
[time=2209] Get good lenses.
[time=2210] God's word is not silent about those things.
[time=2214] Look at verse six of Psalm 145.
[time=2218] They will speak of the might of your awesome deeds and I will let her be, declare your greatness.
[time=2223] I was reading Psalm 145 in a Gideon New Testament that my grandfather gave me.
[time=2229] When I was 12 years old, my son's adopted as his own, has made some notations of his own in the front.
[time=2234] I was happy to see some four-year-old notations.
[time=2238] If you get my drift, he sleeps with this Bible.
[time=2243] I don't know why he does, but I'm really glad that he does.
[time=2246] Verse six in the King James reads like this,
[time=2252] "And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts." And we say, I don't careable, God's not terrible,
[time=2263] and I don't know.
[time=2265] I think that our God isn't terrible enough because terrible is a word for awesome.
[time=2272] I think about the Wizard of Oz, go with me.
[time=2275] The Wizard of Oz, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man
[time=2281] and the Cowardly Lion.
[time=2282] Go to see the Great and Terrible Wizard of Oz, Big Head, Fire.
[time=2287] Have you seen that movie?
[time=2289] A lot of my students haven't seen that movie and it's heartbreaking.
[time=2291] (audience laughs) I think some of you may have seen that movie and you know what I'm talking about?
[time=2295] The Big Head and the Terrible Oz, right?
[time=2298] They go to see him because he is great and because he is powerful and because he is terrible to be feared, right?
[time=2308] But because they go to see him, it then allows him later on in the story to give them mercy, to give them those gifts that they need.
[time=2316] Do you see?
[time=2319] I approach God because he is great and when I approach him as great, as awesome as, if you will, terrible, he is disposed to be gracious to me.
[time=2330] Let's let her be in your outline.
[time=2332] God, the Lord is gracious.
[time=2338] We were watching The Lion the Witch in the Wardrobe last night.
[time=2342] Get the book, read it, then watch the movie.
[time=2344] Read the book first.
[time=2345] Meditate, focus, right?
[time=2351] Just help yourself, make it easy for your kids, make it easy for you to meditate and focus.
[time=2356] (audience laughs) At the very end, Lucy is sad because as Landa, Savior Lion King is walking away from her and she's gonna miss him and he goes, was that gonna hang around for you to pet him on the head?
[time=2368] He's not a tame lion and she says, nobody's good.
[time=2372] Not a tame lion, but he is good.
[time=2377] That's a good picture.
[time=2380] The wondrous works upon which we will focus will speak of what the New Living Translation says are his awe-inspiring deeds.
[time=2390] Look at Psalm 19 verses one through four.
[time=2399] There's a lot to say, friend, this morning.
[time=2401] I hope you'll bear with me.
[time=2402] There's a lot to say from God's word.
[time=2403] I hope you'll bear with me as we say it.
[time=2405] Psalm 19, these are familiar verses to you.
[time=2409] The heavens declare the glory of God and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.
[time=2416] Day to day, pours out speech.
[time=2419] Night to night reveals knowledge.
[time=2420] There is no speech nor are there words whose voice is not heard.
[time=2426] Their voice goes out through all of the earth, their words, the end of the world, proclaiming God's greatness.
[time=2433] Psalm 145 verse seven says, "They shall pour forth the fame of your abundant goodness." God's goodness is abundant and famous.
[time=2447] What a thought.
[time=2448] And shall sing aloud of your righteousness.
[time=2452] Did I ever tell you that sometimes you feel like cupping my hands when I worship?
[time=2455] Did I ever tell you that before?
[time=2456] I do, that's not, maybe that's strange.
[time=2460] I feel like I want to just shout it.
[time=2462] Does it ever happen to you?
[time=2463] I feel like I want to just cut my hands and shout.
[time=2465] Ollie, luya.
[time=2466] I felt my feet coming up off the ground this morning.
[time=2469] What a God.
[time=2473] Terrible and good.
[time=2475] Awesome and good.
[time=2476] Great and good.
[time=2478] I was at a conference last summer and I heard an Islamic studies professor tell me that Muslims hope of relationship with Allah as close as they will get is this, that at the end of time they will see Allah's silhouette cross the horizon.
[time=2497] That's as close as a Muslim worshipper will ever get to him.
[time=2503] He's great to Muslims.
[time=2506] He's great, he's fearsome.
[time=2507] But there's no connection.
[time=2512] There is no relationship.
[time=2514] God wants to be known.
[time=2517] The God of the Bible wants to be known.
[time=2518] He wants to be found.
[time=2519] He wants to be loved because his love is ever lasting.
[time=2523] His mercies will never come to an end.
[time=2525] Friends, so what a move into the next section of Psalm 145
[time=2533] and God's graciousness.
[time=2536] Number two there, the Lord is gracious.
[time=2539] Look at verse eight.
[time=2542] The Lord is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, that has said.
[time=2549] The Lord is good to all and his mercy is over all that he has made.
[time=2555] Psalm 145 verse eight is the defining statement in the Old Testament about who God is.
[time=2562] It shows us been three of the prophets in the law at Exodus three, four.
[time=2566] And here in the Psalms at least three times.
[time=2569] Word for word, we read Psalm 103.
[time=2571] We read Psalm 145.
[time=2573] The Lord is slow to anger and great in power, abounding in steadfast love.
[time=2577] That is God's conviction from his heart about who he is.
[time=2582] And the Bible at the root of it, friends, this would be good for you to write down somewhere on your bulletin, right down to the ground.
[time=2588] What is the Bible about?
[time=2589] The Bible is fundamentally about divine self-disclosure.
[time=2593] God telling us what he is like.
[time=2600] What's a little bit of kiss about?
[time=2601] What's numbers about?
[time=2603] What's the prophet Nahum about?
[time=2607] It's not about you, just, sorry, for the record.
[time=2612] It's about God letting us know what he's like.
[time=2615] It's a big book, friends.
[time=2617] Look at all this.
[time=2618] There's a lot in there.
[time=2620] Why is it all in there?
[time=2621] 'Cause he wants you to know what he's like.
[time=2623] He wants you to know what he's like and what's he like.
[time=2627] He's slow to anger.
[time=2629] He's great in power.
[time=2630] He's abounding in steadfast love.
[time=2632] That's what he's like.
[time=2635] This is God's fundamental conviction about who he is.
[time=2639] He says it more than any other thing in the Bible about himself.
[time=2642] Go over to Psalm 136, please.
[time=2645] Psalm 136 is a Psalm that has a responsive reading in it.
[time=2651] I like those, you know, I've been around for a while.
[time=2654] Now you know I like responsive readings.
[time=2655] We're gonna do that today.
[time=2657] The priest would likely sing, I won't sing it, but the priest would likely sing the first line of each verse and the congregation would respond with the refrain.
[time=2665] You're gonna say it nine times.
[time=2667] And if you get bored, sing it nine times.
[time=2670] Don't.
[time=2673] So I'll read the first part.
[time=2676] You read the second part.
[time=2677] It'll be in the screens before you declaring God's, who this is, who he is, fundamentally.
[time=2683] And we sang it a few minutes ago, if you remember.
[time=2686] It's never gonna say it again.
[time=2688] Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.
[time=2690] Give thanks to the God of God's.
[time=2699] To him who alone does great wonders.
[time=2704] Who by his understanding made the heavens.
[time=2708] Who spread out the earth upon the waters.
[time=2715] Who made the great lights.
[time=2717] - His love and yours forever.
[time=2719] - The sun to govern the day.
[time=2721] - His love and yours forever.
[time=2723] - The moon and stars to govern the night.
[time=2726] - His love and yours forever.
[time=2728] - You sound great.
[time=2730] There's a lot more in that Psalm, but we'll move on.
[time=2734] Our praise of him, Psalm 145 one and two,
[time=2740] will endure forever, forever and ever.
[time=2742] And so will his love for us.
[time=2746] - There's songs in the radio, but I love you forever, right?
[time=2750] Songs in the radio.
[time=2752] It's not true.
[time=2753] (congregation laughing) It's not true.
[time=2756] His love will last forever.
[time=2763] Is this in the right, I guess this in the right stations are here forever, love in the right, okay, whatever.
[time=2767] Verse nine, Psalm 145, all your, the Lord is good to all.
[time=2772] His mercy is over all that he's made.
[time=2774] All your works will give thanks to you, oh Lord.
[time=2777] All your saints will bless you.
[time=2780] Tell about your abundant goodness.
[time=2783] And I think in verses 11 through 13, the psalmist, says David's last Psalm.
[time=2790] He's just grabbing for every word he can.
[time=2793] He's just running out of words.
[time=2795] He just is bubbling over here.
[time=2797] Look at these verses 11 through 13.
[time=2799] They will speak of the glory of your kingdom and tell of your power to make known to the children of man, your mighty deeds and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.
[time=2807] Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.
[time=2809] Your dominion endures throughout all generations.
[time=2813] So what's my response to God being gracious?
[time=2816] Let her A, give thanks.
[time=2819] Give thanks to the Lord of Lords, the God of God.
[time=2822] Give thanks, let her B, make known.
[time=2826] I love to tell the story.
[time=2831] To be my theme in glory.
[time=2834] To tell the old old story of Jesus and his love.
[time=2838] I love to tell the story more wonderful it seems than all the golden fancies of all our golden dreams.
[time=2846] I love to tell the story.
[time=2848] It's pleasant to repeat what seems each time I tell it more wonderfully sweet.
[time=2854] People want to hear your story.
[time=2859] That's evangelism.
[time=2862] We use big words like evangelism and discipleship and they can be intimidating sometimes.
[time=2868] Let me just break it down for you and make it very simple.
[time=2870] Evangelism is you telling your story to other people about what God has done for you.
[time=2875] I know some of your stories and they're good stories.
[time=2878] Need to be told, need to be heard.
[time=2881] Tell your story.
[time=2883] What has God done for you?
[time=2885] If you'd have a good story, ask him to give you one.
[time=2892] Read his word and tell that story.
[time=2894] Does it seem more pleasant,
[time=2900] more wonderfully sweet every time you tell it?
[time=2902] Or are you kind of in a church, you've been in church your whole life and it's kind of like, well, I love to tell the story.
[time=2909] Don't be my theme in glory.
[time=2911] Yeah, whatever.
[time=2912] I sure hope not.
[time=2915] God keep us, keep your word and your spirit fresh in our lives day by day.
[time=2921] Give thanks and make it known.
[time=2923] Psalm 145 verse 14, we'll jump in there as the psalm concludes.
[time=2930] Psalm 145 verses 14 through 21.
[time=2932] In the third Roman numeral there is the Lord is good.
[time=2935] God is great, God is gracious, God is good, good.
[time=2940] Look at verse 14 with me.
[time=2946] The Lord upholds all who are falling and raises up all who are bowed down.
[time=2953] Another version reads bent over.
[time=2957] Those were discouraged.
[time=2960] Are you discouraged this morning about something?
[time=2965] Do you feel like a burden is weighing on you
[time=2971] and that you can't seem to get on top of it?
[time=2972] God's word is true.
[time=2975] He will uphold you.
[time=2978] Listen to all these verbs in this section.
[time=2980] All kinds of verbs.
[time=2981] Let them just kind of break over you like waves, all right?
[time=2984] All these verbs are about what God does in this section of Psalm 145.
[time=2990] Look at this, raises up all who are bowed down.
[time=2995] The eyes of all look to you and you give them their food in due season.
[time=3000] You open your hand.
[time=3002] You satisfy the desire of every living thing.
[time=3006] The Lord is righteous in all his ways, kind in all his works.
[time=3011] The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.
[time=3016] He fulfills the desire of those who fear him.
[time=3018] He also hears their cry and saves them.
[time=3023] The Lord preserves all who love, but all the wicked he will destroy.
[time=3027] My mouth will speak the praise of the Lord and let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever.
[time=3037] He forgives, preserves, fulfills, hears, opens his hand.
[time=3043] Are you looking to other things to open their hand to give you what you want?
[time=3046] Because they won't have anything for you.
[time=3047] When God opens his hands, every living thing's desire is satisfied.
[time=3052] Broken cisterns.
[time=3057] I was in here when Kelly mentioned that a few weeks ago, maybe a few months ago.
[time=3061] Broken cisterns that don't have any water, stop going to him for water because they won't satisfy.
[time=3067] I'm preaching to myself here.
[time=3069] The New Living Translation reads verse 14, says, "Those bent beneath their loads." Jesus said, "Come, all who are weary,
[time=3082] all who are heavy laid, now give you rest.
[time=3084] Only he can." If you want to come and have rest this morning, I'll be here when service is over.
[time=3091] I'd love to talk with you about that.
[time=3093] All in his name, he hears your cry.
[time=3095] He will save you some 145, verse 19.
[time=3098] As the worship band comes to lead us in worship and response,
[time=3112] again, I want to ask you some questions.
[time=3115] And I'll finish the outline.
[time=3119] I didn't do that.
[time=3120] I'm sorry.
[time=3120] The Lord is good.
[time=3122] He's good letter A in who he is.
[time=3127] And he's good letter B in what he does.
[time=3131] Who is he?
[time=3132] He's righteous.
[time=3134] He's kind.
[time=3135] He's near.
[time=3136] He's a preserver.
[time=3138] He's also a destroyer.
[time=3139] Don't miss that.
[time=3141] He's also a kind letter B in what he does.
[time=3144] Who he is and what he does.
[time=3147] He preserves.
[time=3147] He provides.
[time=3148] He opens his hand.
[time=3150] He listens to your cries for help.
[time=3152] The Psalm ends the way it starts with this forever and ever
[time=3159] praise of God.
[time=3161] Are you making him known?
[time=3164] Are you looking to him to open his hand to fulfill your desires or are you looking somewhere else?
[time=3170] Sing this morning.
[time=3175] Let's stand and sing together in response to what Psalm 145 has told us about who God is and what he's done.
[time=3181] And respond as we should.
[time=3183] Respond to how we will for all the Eternities.
[time=3209] The earth rejoices all the earth rejoices.
[time=3214] He wraps himself in life and darkness tries to hide.
[time=3225] Trembles at his voice.
[time=3234] How great is our God.
[time=3240] Sing with me.
[time=3241] How great is our God.
[time=3246] And oh, we'll see how great.
[time=3249] How great is our God.
[time=3260] And days to wait he stands.
[time=3264] And time is in his hands.
[time=3270] You're getting in the end.
[time=3276] The God had three in one.
[time=3283] Father's spirit's son.
[time=3290] The lion and the lamb.
[time=3296] How great is our God.
[time=3302] Sing with me.
[time=3304] How great is our God.
[time=3309] Oh, we'll see how great, how great is our God.
[time=3319] For the name of God, oh, me.
[time=3327] You are worthy of our praise.
[time=3335] Yes, my heart will sing, how great is our God.
[time=3343] For the name of our own name.
[time=3352] You are worthy of our praise.
[time=3360] Yes, my heart will sing, how great is our God.
[time=3369] How great is our God.
[time=3377] Sing with me.
[time=3380] How great is our God.
[time=3385] And oh, we'll see how great, how great is our God.
[time=3394] How great is our God.
[time=3403] Sing with me.
[time=3405] How great is our God.
[time=3410] And oh, we'll see how great, how great is our God.
[time=3421] I'm so glad you were here today.
[time=3431] All the promises of God are true.
[time=3434] He hears you when you call on Him.
[time=3437] He will save you when you cry out to Him.
[time=3439] From whatever you're facing today.
[time=3441] Next week, Josh rang me back with Psalm 139.
[time=3445] Please come back in here from Him.
[time=3447] Week after that will be in Psalm 40 for a couple of weeks.
[time=3451] So be reading Psalm 139.
[time=3452] Be ready.
[time=3453] Be reading Psalm 40.
[time=3454] Be ready.
[time=3455] Let's pray together as we dismiss.
[time=3457] Lord, you are gracious.
[time=3461] You're slow to anger.
[time=3463] You are rich in love.
[time=3465] You are good to all.
[time=3466] You are great.
[time=3468] You are gracious.
[time=3469] And you are good.
[time=3470] And until you meet again, Father, would you please hold my dear friends in the palm of your hand?
[time=3475] Would you lead them, as the Psalms say, by still and quiet waters?
[time=3483] Would you restore their soul?
[time=3485] I pray all these things this morning in Jesus' strong name.
[time=3489] [AMEN]
[time=3498] (Music)
