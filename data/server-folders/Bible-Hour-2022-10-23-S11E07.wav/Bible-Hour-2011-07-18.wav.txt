[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=35] My name's Corbin Miller, and I'm the worship pastor at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=39] It's my privilege every Sunday to lead our church family in a time of musical worship, and I'm honored today to take some time to introduce this episode to all of you.
[time=50] We're in a series this summer called "The Songs of Summer," and we've been looking at several different songs every Sunday.
[time=56] Last week was no exception, and Josh Rang preached on Psalm 139.
[time=62] Josh Rang is a member of our congregation with some extraordinary teaching and preaching gifts, and I think you'll really enjoy what he had to share with all of us about Psalm 139.
[time=72] Psalm 139 is an amazing song that addresses some pretty incredible truths about God.
[time=78] For one, he's an omniscient God.
[time=79] He knows absolutely everything, and the Psalm says, "Even the very words we speak before we speak them." He's also a God who's ever-present.
[time=88] He's at all places simultaneously around the globe.
[time=91] We can never flee from his presence.
[time=94] Another way that God's amazing in Psalm 139 is his creative power.
[time=99] It's a Psalm that helps us understand the sanctity of human life, even in a mother's womb, and how before we're even formed as people, God knows who we're going to be and what our days will be like.
[time=112] Psalm 139 is also a great Psalm that speaks the name of Jesus throughout it all.
[time=118] The Psalms are real subtle in the way that they teach us about Christ, but every one of them does.
[time=122] And I think you'll appreciate how Josh Rang shows us kind of by reading between the lines how Psalm 139 whispers the name Jesus throughout.
[time=132] I hope that you enjoy Josh's preaching today, and I hope that you'll stick with us for the rest of the summer as we look at more Psalms that teach us about our Savior whom we love.
[time=142] Thanks for tuning in today.
[time=143] - Good morning, church.
[time=148] We're gonna start our time today singing this prayer together, inviting God's presence to be among us today as we worship and sing, and he would inhabit our praises.
[time=159] [MUSIC - 221 seconds]
[time=385] Let's sing that verse again that speaks
[time=394] of us being lost in darkness and needing so desperately for Jesus to bring us into the light.
[time=400] [MUSIC - 254 seconds]
[time=655] - If you know that he's worthy, would you clap your hands this morning and praise from what he's done?
[time=662] (congregation applauding) - All right.
[time=666] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 242 seconds]
[time=915] [AMEN] (audience applauding) - I'm so happy to introduce Josh Rang Teeth.
[time=924] You guys know Josh, but I just love him.
[time=927] He's a good friend.
[time=928] He and his wife Paula are a constant encouragement to Jody and I would just love it if you would give another very warm black hawk welcome to my friend Josh Rang.
[time=938] (audience applauding) - Well, good morning.
[time=950] It's always just a joy for me to be able to do this with you and as often as I can do it, I'm thankful.
[time=958] So it's great to be with you this morning.
[time=961] If you have your Bibles turned to Psalm 139, I've titled the message this morning, the all-knowing, ever-present creator God wants what's best for you.
[time=973] And we're gonna look at Psalm 139 and as you're turning to Psalm 139, I'm grateful for the kids and what they've already told you about Psalm 139.
[time=985] And hopefully we can just continue to learn from that and expand on that.
[time=989] There's an interesting question I've discussed, or I've heard discussed recently about the primary goal of the Bible.
[time=996] And the question is this, is the Bible primarily about me and what I'm called to do, or is the Bible primarily about God and what he has done?
[time=1007] And to answer that question, I'm turning to a different author, which is Sally Lloyd-Jones, who has written the Jesus storybook Bible, which I think should be in every household, regardless of whether there are kids there or not.
[time=1019] But the introduction says this, and this will answer our question.
[time=1025] It says this, "Now some people think the Bible is a book of rules, telling you what you should and shouldn't do.
[time=1031] The Bible certainly does have some rules in it.
[time=1034] They show you how life works best.
[time=1036] But the Bible isn't mainly about you and what you should be doing.
[time=1040] It's about God and what he has done.
[time=1044] Other people think the Bible is a book of heroes, showing you some people you should copy.
[time=1048] The Bible does have some heroes in it, but as you'll soon find out, most of the people in the Bible aren't heroes at all.
[time=1055] They make some big mistakes, sometimes on purpose.
[time=1059] They get afraid and run away, and at times they're downright mean.
[time=1064] No, the Bible isn't a book of rules or a book of heroes.
[time=1069] The Bible is most of all a story.
[time=1072] It's an adventure story about a young hero who comes from a far country to win back his lost treasure.
[time=1081] It's a love story about a brave prince who leaves his palace, his throne, everything to rescue the one he loves.
[time=1088] It's like the most wonderful of fairy tales that has come true in real life.
[time=1094] And you see the best thing about this story is it's true.
[time=1098] You see, there are lots of stories in the Bible, but all the stories are telling one big story, the story of how God loves his children and comes to rescue them.
[time=1108] It takes the whole Bible to tell this story, and at the center of the story, there's a baby.
[time=1115] And every story in the Bible whispers his name.
[time=1120] I believe that to be true.
[time=1123] The Bible is primarily about God and what he has done.
[time=1130] This is nowhere better seen than in the declaratives of Scripture.
[time=1134] And if you go back to high school English or maybe middle school English when you learned about sentences and how they all work together, there are declaratives, there are imperatives.
[time=1143] Declaratives are statements of fact, things that are true.
[time=1147] Imperatives are things like commands that tell us what we're supposed to do.
[time=1152] Again, when we look at the declarative passages of Scripture, they're made up of statements about who God is and what he's done.
[time=1161] And these declaratives are the foundation of our faith.
[time=1166] And they also are the fuel for our obedience.
[time=1170] Without declaratives, we would have no faith.
[time=1174] We wouldn't know who God was and what he called us to do.
[time=1177] We'd simply be living moral lives and trying to do the best that we could on our own.
[time=1182] And so the declaratives are supremely important.
[time=1186] And as we study Psalm 139 today, we will find that David, as the little a author and God, the big author behind that, has filled Psalm 139 with numerous declaratives.
[time=1199] In fact, we won't find one command in the entire Psalm.
[time=1205] What we're going to see, or we will see, that David focuses on what he knows and believes about God.
[time=1214] He spends his time on two main points.
[time=1217] First, he describes that God knows everything.
[time=1221] He's everywhere, and he is the Creator.
[time=1224] Secondly, in light of that truth of who God is, he describes how God graciously deals with him on a daily basis.
[time=1234] And let's read Psalm 139.
[time=1237] And if you would, let's stand together and honor God's Word.
[time=1242] Psalm 139, we're going to read it all.
[time=1245] It says this, "O Lord, you have searched me and known me.
[time=1248] You know when I sit down and when I rise up.
[time=1252] You understand my thought from afar.
[time=1254] You scrutinize my path and my lying down and are intimately acquainted with all my ways.
[time=1260] Even before there's a word on my tongue, behold, O Lord, you know it all.
[time=1264] You have enclosed me behind and before and laid your hand upon me.
[time=1268] Such knowledge is too wonderful for me.
[time=1271] It's too high.
[time=1272] I cannot attain to it.
[time=1275] Where can I go from your spirit, or where can I flee from your presence?
[time=1278] If I ascend to heaven, you're there.
[time=1280] If I make my bed and shield, behold, you are there.
[time=1283] If I take the wings of the dawn, if I dwell in the remotest part of the sea, even there, your hand will lead me, and your right hand will lay hold of me.
[time=1293] If I say surely the darkness will overwhelm me, even the light around me will be night.
[time=1298] Even the darkness is not dark to you, and the night is as bright as the day.
[time=1303] Darkness and light are a light to you.
[time=1306] For you formed my inward parts.
[time=1309] You wove me in my mother's womb.
[time=1311] I will give thanks to you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[time=1315] Wonderful are your works, and my soul knows it very well.
[time=1319] And my frame was not hidden from you when I was made in secret and skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth.
[time=1325] Your eyes have seen my unformed substance, and in your book were all written the days that were ordained for me.
[time=1332] When as yet there was not one of them.
[time=1335] How precious also are your thoughts to me, O God?
[time=1339] How vast is the sum of them?
[time=1341] If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand when I awake I am still with you.
[time=1346] Oh, that you would slay the wicked, O God.
[time=1349] Depart from me, therefore, men of bloodshed.
[time=1352] For they speak against you wickedly, and your enemies take your name in vain.
[time=1357] Do I not hate those who hate you, O Lord?
[time=1359] And do I not loathe those who rise up against you?
[time=1362] I hate them with utmost hatred.
[time=1364] They have become my enemies.
[time=1366] Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[time=1370] Try me, and know my anxious thoughts, and see if there be any hurtful way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
[time=1380] You may be seated, and let's pray.
[time=1386] Father, we are desperately in need of hearing from you today.
[time=1391] And I am so grateful that you long to support your children.
[time=1397] Thank God I stand here again just acutely aware of my great need to communicate your truth and just ask for your spirit, eagerly anticipating your spirit, to give me the words to say, to turn the lights on in our eyes to see your truth that you have for us today.
[time=1416] You are Jesus, the bread of life that come down out of heaven.
[time=1421] You are the living water.
[time=1423] And so we just ask for nourishment today for our souls.
[time=1427] In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[time=1431] So let's take a look at that first point that David talked about, and that is God's character.
[time=1438] As you look at Psalm 139, one of the things that I do when I approach Scripture is I do a lot of circling and I look for repeated phrases and repeated nouns, and literally the personal pronoun for God, you or your, happens 29 different times in Psalm 139, more than there are verses in Psalm 139.
[time=1457] So I can confidently say that this Psalm is all about God.
[time=1462] He is the subject of this Psalm.
[time=1466] And in verse one through six we can quickly see that God is omniscient.
[time=1472] The kids saying about it, it's something that you probably already know, but that is just a big word to say that he sees everything.
[time=1480] He knows everything.
[time=1482] There is not anything that he can learn, he knows it all.
[time=1486] He cannot be taught, he sees it all, he knows it all, he's omniscient.
[time=1493] It's a fact about who God is, one of his attributes.
[time=1497] Another attribute that comes in this Psalm is verses seven through twelve that talks about God's omnipresence.
[time=1504] And again, a big word just to mean that he's everywhere.
[time=1509] You can't go somewhere where God's presence is not there.
[time=1514] He is bigger than we can ever imagine.
[time=1517] He has created everything and he is always present.
[time=1521] The Psalm says, if I go to heaven, you're there.
[time=1523] If I make my bed and shield, you're there.
[time=1526] Wherever I go, your hand is there.
[time=1530] He cannot go anywhere from his spirit, from God's spirit.
[time=1535] His omniscience, his omnipresence, and then thirdly in verses 13 through 17 are God's omnipotence.
[time=1542] The idea that he is the creator, that he is all powerful.
[time=1547] And as you look there at specifically focusing on the idea that he creates us, he created David specifically in this Psalm.
[time=1555] The idea that even before David was born, God knew him.
[time=1562] God was his creator. His days are ordained by God.
[time=1567] And as a result of being the creator, David knows that he has to give an account
[time=1575] to his creator for how he's lived.
[time=1579] God is the all-knowing, ever-present creator God.
[time=1585] That is what he's like.
[time=1588] And if David stopped at this point, he would probably be in great despair.
[time=1596] Think about this for a minute.
[time=1598] The one who has complete authority over David's life is also the one who sees everything that David does, who sees every thought that David has,
[time=1609] that has known everywhere that David has gone.
[time=1615] And so if that's all we knew about God, not only would David be in great despair,
[time=1622] but you would be in great despair.
[time=1625] Because you, like me, are someone who is full of sin, and at the depth of who we are,
[time=1631] there is this wickedness, there is this human nature that steps away from God and away from what he wants to go after what we think is best for us.
[time=1642] And so apart from where we're going next, apart from where David goes next, we would just be in great despair.
[time=1650] Without help, without hope, and yet David moves forward, he doesn't stop there.
[time=1655] There's much more to know and believe about God, and that is the second point, and that is this.
[time=1662] God's gracious dealings with David.
[time=1666] You see, not only is this song about God, he's the subject of it, but David is the object of God's care and God's guidance.
[time=1678] This is all about how God deals with David.
[time=1682] First, look at his guidance.
[time=1684] Look at verse three, it says this.
[time=1687] "You scrutinize my path and my laying down." Look at, as it says in the very next section, "And you are intimately acquainted with all my ways."
[time=1698] Look at verse 10, it says this, "Even there, God, your hand will lead me, your right hand will lay hold of me." Verse 16 talks about the days that were ordained for me.
[time=1711] And so there is this emphasis upon the daily interaction between God and David.
[time=1718] There is a constant interaction.
[time=1720] It is daily, it is moment by moment, and these repeated phrases about knowing his path
[time=1726] and knowing his way and knowing his days and understand that God is leading and guiding
[time=1732] all give us a sense that God is intimately involved in the everyday events of David's life.
[time=1739] There is a sense of God's concern for the path which David progresses on.
[time=1746] It's the idea that he wants, not only does he know David.
[time=1750] He knows the good, the bad, and the ugly, but he also, even in the midst of that knowledge, he wants to help David move in the right direction.
[time=1759] He wants what's best for David.
[time=1764] Picture is of this, it's not much different than how I am with my two girls.
[time=1770] They're five and seven.
[time=1772] And any time that we are in some sort of large crowd or trying to make our way through
[time=1779] some sort of crowd to the other side, whether it's going to a tin caps game or some other event
[time=1786] where there's just people around and we're trying to move from one side of that crowd to the other, instinctively what I do is I reach down right away to grab two hands.
[time=1798] Because I know if I don't grab onto those two hands, there will be so many people going here and there
[time=1805] that I might not have them at the end of my journey.
[time=1810] There is this instinctive nature that I have to help them go the right direction so that we can get home.
[time=1820] My five-year-old Jillian gets very interested in bugs and different things as we're on walks.
[time=1828] And there are times when she's walking and about ready to run into a tree.
[time=1834] And so there, again, this instinctiveness of me just laying a hand on her shoulder
[time=1840] and just directing her to the right a little bit to allow her to keep on going.
[time=1846] That's the idea of what God is trying to do for David.
[time=1850] He's saying, "Listen, I want you to go in the right direction.
[time=1855] I want to help you.
[time=1857] I want to guide you and I want to lead you.
[time=1860] And my right hand is upon you as I do that." So there is this emphasis upon God's guidance on a daily basis of God's care for David.
[time=1873] And then it's demonstrated in God's grace.
[time=1876] So not only is it his guidance as he deals with us, but that guidance is full of grace.
[time=1881] And in the Psalm, there are about six different pockets of God's grace that I want to show you.
[time=1886] So we can verse five and verse ten.
[time=1889] And each of these support structures of God start with your, in other words, God, your,
[time=1896] and then hand is the first one.
[time=1898] And then it's your spirit and then your presence.
[time=1901] All of this is God's grace to us.
[time=1903] And look at the first one, your hand, verse five.
[time=1905] You have enclosed me behind and before and laid your hand upon me.
[time=1912] Look at verse ten, even there, your hand will lead me and your right hand will lay hold of me.
[time=1920] There is this, again, this idea of God just stepping in and trying to direct and guide and help.
[time=1929] But it is this idea that David did not deserve this.
[time=1933] You don't deserve this.
[time=1934] I don't deserve this, but God is stretching down his personal hand to guide and to direct and to care.
[time=1945] And not only is it your hand, it goes on in verse six to say that your spirit, that God had given David his spirit,
[time=1953] God gives you and me his spirit to indwell us, to open our eyes to truth, to help us make wise decisions.
[time=1961] It is his spirit, his very own spirit that resides within us.
[time=1966] That David didn't deserve, that we don't deserve.
[time=1969] Not only is his spirit, but his presence.
[time=1972] This idea that it's not just some off, you know, off in the distance, God, but he's just personal.
[time=1979] His presence is there.
[time=1980] So it's your hand, your spirit, your presence.
[time=1983] Look at verse 16, it says, "Your eyes were upon me."
[time=1989] Just the personal intimacy of the gaze of God to look upon David, even before he was born.
[time=2001] That's very personal.
[time=2004] And then from your eyes, it goes to your days.
[time=2008] And the idea that, yes, he gazed upon David at the very beginning, but then also the number of days that were allotted for David were already set and ordained by God.
[time=2018] No matter how long or how short, it was according to God's plan.
[time=2025] And God has days set aside for David.
[time=2030] And God has days planned for you.
[time=2033] They're your days, and they come from the hand of God.
[time=2038] And then your book, verse 16, this idea that those days were written in that book, right?
[time=2048] I don't know if there's a real book in heaven.
[time=2051] I don't know if that's figurative or not, but I know that God has a record of you, of who you are, has a record of David.
[time=2059] And then finally, verse 17, tells us your thoughts.
[time=2069] He has thoughts about you.
[time=2072] Psalm 8 says this, "O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[time=2078] When I consider the heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained, what is man that you would take thought of him?
[time=2088] That you would consider him." That's what's happening here in Psalm 139 as David just reflects.
[time=2094] As it's sprinkled throughout God's character, it's these evidences of God's grace.
[time=2100] It's evidences of his support.
[time=2102] It's your hand and your spirit and your presence and your eyes and your book and your thoughts.
[time=2109] And David continues to portray God and rejoice in God as one who wants what is best for him.
[time=2118] These verses do not give us the picture of just some cold, distant dictator who is trying to keep us from all that is right and good.
[time=2126] On the contrary, these verses are communicating a loving father who only wants what is best for his child.
[time=2137] And so if we were left with despair, God's grace enters the picture quickly to say that we don't have to despair because even though God knows me so intimately, he is supporting me and moving me in the right direction.
[time=2152] And we'll see what that right direction is as we move forward.
[time=2155] But that's God's gracious dealings with David.
[time=2158] So up to this point, we've seen that David focuses on what he knows and believes about God, vitally important.
[time=2167] He spent his time on two main points.
[time=2171] He's described what God knows, that he knows everything, that he's everywhere, that he's the creator.
[time=2176] And then secondly, in light of all that, he described how God graciously deals with him on a daily basis.
[time=2182] Now let's look to David's response.
[time=2186] And the psalm will tell us there's really only two responses to understanding who God is and how he deals with us.
[time=2192] And let's see how David responds.
[time=2194] Look at verses 23 and 24.
[time=2196] It says this, "O Lord, search me, O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my anxious thoughts, and see if there be any hurtful way in me and lead me in the everlasting way."
[time=2211] In the Hebrew, you will find that these are imperatives inside the Hebrew.
[time=2216] But it's really not the idea of the fact that God is commanding us to do anything.
[time=2221] It's really kind of the nerve of David to try to command God to help him.
[time=2227] It is this humble plea, this beg for help to say, "God, if you don't act, if you don't show up big here, I'm in serious trouble.
[time=2239] I need you desperately to do this for me." It's David's humility, it's an ongoing openness to correction and guidance.
[time=2253] And his response, the first is this, it's the everlasting way.
[time=2258] He says, "God, lead me in the everlasting way." Well, what does he mean by that?
[time=2263] I mean, it sounds like a neat phrase, right?
[time=2265] And we kind of get an idea, but what really is he talking about?
[time=2270] I think in order for us to understand what he's talking about, we need to go back to his time and place.
[time=2277] And if you have your Bible, turn to 2 Samuel 7.
[time=2282] 2 Samuel 7, it will be on the screen.
[time=2285] But this is what's known as the Davidic Covenant.
[time=2290] And in here, we are going to see in the first section of 2 Samuel 7 verses 8 through 17, we're not going to read.
[time=2298] But there is God's promise to David that there would be one who would come after him, who would be on his throne, and his kingdom would last forever.
[time=2311] It would be everlasting.
[time=2314] So here's what David says in response to that, in verse 18 of 2 Samuel 7.
[time=2320] David the king went in and sat before the Lord, and he said, "Who am I, O Lord God?
[time=2325] And what is my house that you have brought me this far?" And yet this was insignificant in your eyes, O Lord God, for you have spoken also of the house of your servant concerning the distant future.
[time=2336] And this is the custom of man, O Lord God.
[time=2339] And what more can David say to you, for you know your servant, O Lord God, for the sake of your word, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness to let your servant know.
[time=2351] For this reason you are great, O Lord God, and there is none like you, and there is no God beside you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
[time=2361] And verse 24 says this, "For you have established yourself, your people Israel, as your own people forever, and you O Lord have become their God.
[time=2371] Now therefore O Lord God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and his house, the word is this, that there would be a king from David's line that would reign forever.
[time=2384] Would you confirm that, God," he says, "and may the house of your servant David be established forever."
[time=2394] When David in Psalm 139 references this idea of lead me in the way everlasting, I think we have to understand the historical context to come back to this idea that what David is talking about is this promise of God,
[time=2412] this plan of God that would lead into eternity.
[time=2418] You see, all of the Old Testament is racing toward Calvary.
[time=2424] All of the Old Testament is on a trajectory to the cross of Christ, and it began in Genesis when there was this great need of a Savior because of the sin of Adam and Eve.
[time=2436] In Genesis chapter 3, verse 15, there is the first mention of the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ, and that first mention comes in verse 15 where it says this.
[time=2448] That David speaks to Eve and says, "Someone will come from your offspring, and that offspring, although his heel will be bruised, his heel will crush the head of Satan."
[time=2461] So from the very beginning, there was this hope for humanity that there was coming a rescuer.
[time=2470] We just didn't get much clarity around it in Genesis 3.
[time=2474] But as the Old Testament progresses toward the New Testament, there are greater clarifications of this rescuer who's coming.
[time=2482] And in Genesis 12, we get a further detail. When God says to Abraham, He says, "I will make you a great nation. I'll give you a land. I'll make your name great, and in your family, all the nations of the world will be blessed."
[time=2497] It is a glimpse of again this coming one that would start with Eve, that would go to Abraham, and now would come to David, which would fast forward to Calvary one day as Christ would come to be the Redeemer God.
[time=2515] And in David's mind, he doesn't know who Christ is. All he can say is, "I am going to walk in the way of God's promise, plan of his care for his people."
[time=2529] That's what he's talking about. Oh God, lead me in the way everlasting. What he's saying is this, "Your plan, oh God, is what's best for me. I can't do better than what you've promised. It is what's best for me. We on this side of the cross can say without a shadow of a doubt that Christ, you are what's best for me."
[time=2555] And when we talk about what's best for me, it's important to understand that definition, that God's best for you is not determined by how you view your current circumstances.
[time=2566] Do you know that? God's best for you cannot be determined by how you're currently viewing your current circumstances, because we're not going to view every circumstance correctly.
[time=2578] In fact, because sin entered the world, there is death, there is disease, there is sorrow, which was never intended by God.
[time=2587] But God's best for you while you cannot determine that by your current circumstances, it can be determined by the one great circumstance of human history, which is Calvary.
[time=2602] And from Calvary flows from there that God uses every circumstance for our good to grow us into the image of his son and ultimately perfect us as he brings us to heaven with him one day.
[time=2617] You see, I'm not qualified, you're not qualified to comment on the goodness of our circumstances.
[time=2626] The only area that we're qualified to do that is in our redemption, because we know without a shadow of a doubt it is done, it is finished, but our current circumstances, what we think is best for us.
[time=2637] We're not qualified to comment on that, I don't know what's best for me, you don't know what's best for me, God does know what's best for you.
[time=2647] And that best centered itself upon the promise plan of God, which David is speaking about, which is on a trajectory to Christ.
[time=2660] So David, in a posture of humility and full of trust, says to God, would you please lead me in the way of the one coming and of his righteousness?
[time=2672] In essence, God, you know what's best for me, would you please help me to walk in that way?
[time=2681] You know me, you've searched my heart, I'm thankful for your grace and I need your grace more and more, would you please lead me, and would you please keep me from the hurtful way?
[time=2696] Look down in verse 24, it says this, see if there be any hurtful way in me, literally in the Hebrew it is the way of pain.
[time=2710] There's only two responses, it is that humility to say God lead me in your way, or the other response is a response of pride.
[time=2721] That comes back to a self-reliance, that comes back to a self-attonement even, that says God, I don't need you, I'm going to handle this on my own.
[time=2734] God, thanks but no thanks, I think I'm good enough.
[time=2740] There's a self-reliance, there's a self-attonement, there's a departure from what God has called us to do, and that is to walk in the way of his promise plan.
[time=2750] The way of grace, and so David is asking God to say God, would you please do some soul surgery on me?
[time=2759] If there is any cancer of sin in me, would you cut it out, would you get it out at all costs?
[time=2764] Because that's the way of isolation, it's the way of self-reliance and self-attonement, and David says I don't want anything to do with it.
[time=2772] And verses 19 through 22, which seems somewhat random in the Psalm, they come back to this idea of the way of pain.
[time=2781] He says, would you please just do whatever you can, God, to take away anyone or anything who's going to get in the way of your promise plan of redemption.
[time=2795] And it's not just his enemies, it's also sometimes himself.
[time=2802] Because we sometimes, David sometimes, chose the way of pain.
[time=2810] We do that, and that's why we need God's grace.
[time=2815] And so David responds with just flying colors to the truth about who God is and how he deals with him to just say God, you know what's best for me, search me, cut out anything that's bad, and would you please lead me, continue to guide me in the right direction.
[time=2834] So the principles are true today, God's character has never changed, God sees everything, he knows your thoughts, he knows what you're going to say before you say it, he's ever present, you can't go anywhere that God is not, he is the one who has every right over you, he is your creator, he's the one who formed you in your mother's womb.
[time=2863] Hebrews 4, 13 tells us this, he says that there is no creature hidden from his sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we must give an account, or it says there with whom we have to do, that's the idea that we're going to give an account, and we are literally laid bare before God, he sees everything, he knows everything, he knows my trash, he knows my junk, and that's why I'm in such great need of his grace.
[time=2892] And if we stopped here, I would be in great despair, and if we stopped here you would be in great despair, but God, like he did for David, deals with us graciously, God in his grace, his hand, his spirit, his presence, his eyes, his book, his thoughts are all for you, and for me.
[time=2920] His guidance is there, his right hand is laying upon you, he wants what's best for you, he wants to lead you in the right direction, his grace is sufficient, and there are two responses today just as there were two responses for David.
[time=2937] We can respond with humility like David, and say God, search me and know me, and would you lead me in the everlasting way, and you and I both know this side of Calvary, that that everlasting way is Jesus himself.
[time=2953] John 14, 6, he said it himself, he was saying to his disciples, I'm going to go and prepare a place, and they say, we don't know the way, wait, don't leave, we don't know how to get to where you're going.
[time=2965] And he says, I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no one comes to the Father but through me, he is the way, and not only that, it is always going, he is always going to be the way.
[time=2980] In the book of Revelation, he is referred to as the Lamb of God who was slain more than any other titles.
[time=2987] Even into eternity, you and I will be dependent upon the sacrifice of Christ.
[time=2995] His mercy will continue on, and on, and on forever, and ever, and ever. He is the way, and he is everlasting, and his grace is everlasting.
[time=3007] It doesn't stop.
[time=3012] Again, this is the one great circumstance of human history.
[time=3017] And so we like David in a posture of humility and full of trust should say, lead me in the way.
[time=3024] Lead me in the way of the one who has come, Jesus Christ, and his righteousness.
[time=3030] And would you please take away any self-reliance, and would you take away any self-attonement, and would you help me to just fall upon the grace of Christ over and over and over again?
[time=3045] Let's Psalm 139.
[time=3049] It starts with who God is and what he does, and it ends with this beautiful picture of Jesus Christ.
[time=3055] There is a trajectory of the Old Testament that moves toward Christ.
[time=3059] That's exactly what this is talking about. I'm going to have Corbin come and sing, and he's going to lead us and sing for us a song about Jesus being the way, and then I'll come back, and we will conclude the remainder of our message.
[time=3075] You are the way. You are the truth. You are the life, Jesus. The only way. The only truth. You are my life, Jesus.
[time=3104] Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
[time=3119] In the glorious light of your gospel, broken. The fire stood off his throne, opened his arms as he called out by me.
[time=3136] Jesus is a bolt through me, opened my eyes to see.
[time=3147] You are the way. You are the truth. You are the life, Jesus. The only way. The only truth. You are my life.
[time=3164] Jesus.
[time=3180] You are the source. You are the life. You are the giver of every good thing. You have opened nothing. You have lavished your kindness on me.
[time=3197] Indeed, yourself became poor. One opened and pulled out to death. One highly exalted above all. You are the one. You saved.
[time=3215] You are the way. You are the truth. You are the life, Jesus. The only way. The only truth. You are my life, Jesus. You are the way. You are the truth. You are the life, Jesus.
[time=3243] The only way. The only truth. You are my life, Jesus.
[time=3256] Search my heart and know me. It's just my thoughts. See my face. And lead me in your everlasting ways.
[time=3277] You are my life, Jesus. You are my life, Jesus.
[time=3299] Again, as you read Psalm 139, you won't find one command. Today there's not about being a better husband or being a better wife or five steps to help raise your kids or those things are all good, but that's not what today is about.
[time=3325] Psalm 139 is about your mind and believing and embracing who God is and how He wants to deal with you and to forsake relying upon yourself.
[time=3342] And I don't mean that just in a salvation sense, although that is very true, but every day of your life as a Christian, you've got the choice to be self-reliant, to try to self atone and somehow be good enough for God.
[time=3358] But Christ has done that. He has accomplished that for you. It is done. And so we as God's people need to believe and to think correctly that God is who He is.
[time=3369] And He wants what is best for us and what is best for us is found completely in the person of Christ and functioning and walking in the good of all that Christ has for us.
[time=3384] And so I just beg you today to believe God, to believe that He wants what's best for you and not to believe the lies of the world.
[time=3398] That would say this is best for you or that is best for you. It comes back to Christ and would you let the declaratives of Psalm 139 fortify your faith and fuel your obedience this week as you simply humbly yield to God's plan and to beg for help
[time=3420] as you in an ongoing way are open to His correction and to His guidance and receiving His grace.
[time=3429] No one loves you more or better than Jesus. He is the way. Let's pray.
[time=3444] Father, thank You that we were dead in our trespasses and sins without hope, without God in this world. But then the glorious light of the gospel broke through.
[time=3457] Father, would You stood up from your throne, opened your arms as You called us by name and grace irresistible drew us.
[time=3465] Opened our eyes to see that You are the way of God. Would You humble us today? Would You help us to believe who You are and how You deal with us and how that was accomplished in Christ.
[time=3482] We love You. Thank You for loving us so perfectly. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
