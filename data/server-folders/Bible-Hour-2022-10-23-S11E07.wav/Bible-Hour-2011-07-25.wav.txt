[time=854] No turning back, no turning back, no turning back, no turning back, no turning back, no turning back.
[time=884] So straight as your pick of this old guy, you wrestle with the sinner's heart.
[time=904] You'll feed us by still waters into mercy.
[time=914] If nothing can't keep us apart.
[time=920] So remember your people, remember your children, remember your promise of God.
[time=937] Your grace is enough, your grace is enough, your grace is enough for me.
[time=953] Straight as your love and justice guide, you used the way to lead the strong.
[time=968] You lead us in the song of your television, and all your people sing along.
[time=983] So remember your people, remember your children, remember your promise of God.
[time=999] Your grace is enough, your grace is enough for me.
[time=1013] Yeah, your grace is enough, your grace is enough, your grace is enough for me.
[time=1028] So remember your people, remember your children, remember your promise of God.
[time=1043] Your grace is enough, your grace is enough, your grace is enough for me.
[time=1060] Your grace is enough, your grace is enough for me.
[time=1098] Good morning everybody. My name is Steve Webster, I'm a teaching pastor here at the church.
[time=1124] I also teach in the high school, someone asked me if I'm ready for school this morning, I said no.
[time=1130] I'm not, I'm going to milk it for all it's worth the rest of summer. I hope you will too.
[time=1135] We have been taking a summer in the Psalms, the songs of summer.
[time=1142] We started with Psalm 1, a very good place to start, Psalm 145, Psalm 139, this morning,
[time=1152] and next week will be in the 40th Psalm. So we're going to break up into two parts.
[time=1158] The first part of Psalm 40 is a Psalm of Thanksgiving.
[time=1162] The second part of Psalm 40 is a lament, and we'll talk a lot more about what that means next week.
[time=1169] So back to back, so whatever I don't get to this week, I'll get to it next week, that's a strange new world for me, I'm excited about it.
[time=1175] I want to talk quite so fast. Would you please stand with me today, and we will read the first 10 verses of Psalm 40,
[time=1185] and get a sense of where we are, parents, if you've got kids in here, there's an outline in the bulletin that will help them take notes and walk through,
[time=1194] be a good example to your kids, and take notes as we go. Here's what we're going to talk about today, and I can't wait to talk about it with you.
[time=1204] I waited patiently for the Lord. He inclined to me and heard my cry.
[time=1211] He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the myry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.
[time=1223] He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God, many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.
[time=1234] Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust, who does not turn to the proud, to those who go astray after a lie.
[time=1242] You have multiplied, oh Lord, my God, your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us, none can compare with you.
[time=1251] I will proclaim and tell them yet they are more than can be told.
[time=1256] In sacrifice and offering you've not delighted, but you've given me an open ear, burn offering and sin offering you've not required.
[time=1265] Then I said, behold, I have come. In the scroll of the book it's written of me, I delight to do your will, oh my God, your law is within my heart.
[time=1277] I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation.
[time=1284] Behold, I have not restrained my lips. As you know, oh Lord, I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart.
[time=1292] I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation.
[time=1297] I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness from the great congregation.
[time=1305] Oh Lord, I've prayed this morning many times, I will pray again to you that you would be faithful to say to us from your word what you see fit to say.
[time=1317] And may we be willing to walk in the way that we should.
[time=1323] Lord, your desire for us is obedience, and I pray earnestly and steadfastly that you would give us the strength today to do it.
[time=1333] I pray all this with great thanksgiving for what you have done and what you will do in Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated.
[time=1346] Psalm 40 has, like many of the Psalms do, it has a heading and to take a look at Psalm 40 with me if you have it open there.
[time=1354] The heading is to the choir master, a Psalm of David. So almost right away and many of the Psalms, you're reminded that it's a song.
[time=1364] This word Psalm is an old English word that means song. So if you like music, the Psalms are the place for you.
[time=1374] Take a look at Psalm 40 and what we've just read together. And here is the progression that's at work in the first 10 verses of Psalm 40.
[time=1385] It's really quite remarkable. And I would encourage you to see yourself somewhere in this six step progression.
[time=1393] Okay, watch. Take a look at Psalm 40. Let's kind of let your eyes wander down the page as we look at Psalm 40.
[time=1398] David, here's the first thing. David is in a muddy pit, a pit of destruction. He cries to God from that awful, terrible place for help.
[time=1413] He waits. God draws him out of the pit to safety and then gives him a new song to sing.
[time=1425] And then other people hear what David is singing and they put their trust in the Lord. That's the progression.
[time=1434] He's in a muddy pit. He cries out to God. He waits. God delivers him, gives him a song, and then other people hear what David is singing about and they place their trust in the Lord.
[time=1448] Where are you in that progression? I'll bet that every one of us is somewhere in Psalm 40.
[time=1457] I don't know where you are. I know where some of you are. I've talked to you about it. I don't know where all of you are, but I know in all of it that God is faithful.
[time=1469] Can I hear an amen from somebody? God is faithful.
[time=1473] He is faithful and he will always be faithful. In Psalm 40, by the way, tells that again and again and again. When we are faithless, he is faithful.
[time=1487] That's a promise. I feel faithless a lot. At the end of my rope, I got nothing. I got no more prayers to pray. I got nothing.
[time=1498] Wherever you are today, God will be faithful to meet you. Not where you should be, but where you are.
[time=1505] And aren't you glad? There are four roman numerals in the outline in your bulletin, and they all begin with the letter T.
[time=1513] Corbin told me that alliteration doesn't help him, and that makes me sad.
[time=1518] It helps me. Alliteration is when all begins the same letter. It's a good preaching thing that preachers do. I'm just trying to help.
[time=1524] So letter one, letter one, number A, whatever.
[time=1531] Roman numeral one is Terry, T-A-R-R-Y. Terry is a fancy word for weight that begins with T.
[time=1540] Terry, look at verse one.
[time=1546] I waited patiently for the Lord. That's not how I would start. I'd start with the crying out. God, all right, let's go.
[time=1562] But the first thing is weighted patiently. I tell you how he starts the song. It's very interesting.
[time=1567] The NASB says intently. I waited intently. The Hebrew reads something like, "Relying, I relied."
[time=1577] I waited, waited. It says it twice. Hebrew does that for emphasis.
[time=1583] I waited patiently. I relied, relied on him. Go back to Psalm 37. Psalm 37 is to the left of Psalm 40. It's a couple of pages.
[time=1595] I really think that there's a progression in these Psalms. Psalm 37 finds the Psalmist in verse seven. Psalm 37 verse seven.
[time=1607] The Psalmist is in a place. Look at what it says. Psalm 37 verse seven. This is also David.
[time=1613] Still before the Lord, and wait patiently for him. Fret not yourself over the one who prospers in his way over the man who carries out evil devices.
[time=1628] There's all this about the wicked. The wicked in verse 12. The wicked in verse 14. The wicked in verse 20. The wicked in verse 21.
[time=1635] He's waiting, waiting, waiting. And it's bad. He's in a very, very bad place.
[time=1641] And he says, "I'm just going to wait for God." There's the call to wait. So verse seven is kind of David preaching to himself.
[time=1647] Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him so then he waits.
[time=1651] And in chapter 38. Very bad stuff. Look at what it says in verse 1 through 3 of Psalm 38.
[time=1661] Oh Lord, rebuke me not in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
[time=1669] For your arrows have sunk into me and your hand has come down on me.
[time=1675] There is no soundness in my flesh because of your disapproval, your indignation.
[time=1682] There is no health in my bones because of my sin. Verse 6 says my wounds stink and fester.
[time=1692] That's where he is. That's the place where he waits.
[time=1698] He's still waiting in Psalm 39.
[time=1704] And that brings us to Psalm 40. That's the background.
[time=1707] One of the principal, George McDonald said this. One of the principal parts of faith is patience.
[time=1714] It's a gift of the spirit. It is a fruit of the spirit. It's a gift from him.
[time=1719] And so if you need it in increasing measure because you are tired of waiting, ask him.
[time=1727] Ask him for patience. He delights to give those gifts to his children.
[time=1732] The first letter in Roman room room 1 under wait or terry is that he will save.
[time=1738] Wait for his salvation. Look at what it says in Psalm 27.
[time=1743] It should be on the screens before you and behind me. Psalm 27.
[time=1748] Another familiar Psalm to you. "The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear.
[time=1754] The Lord is the stronghold of my life, of whom shall I be afraid."
[time=1761] And now here's his situation. "Evil doer is a sail meet, eat up my flesh, my adversaries and foes.
[time=1767] It's they who stumble and fall." More circumstances in verse 3.
[time=1772] "Though an army in camp against me, my heart shall not fear. The war arise against me.
[time=1779] I will be confident. One thing have I asked of the Lord, that I will seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple.
[time=1794] Because of verse 5 he will hide me, he will conceal me, he will lift me high."
[time=1800] I don't know what you would say there in verse 4, but it says that one, what he's seeking after is to dwell and to gaze.
[time=1810] And that's a little bit passive. He's waiting patiently.
[time=1815] I think that's what waiting patiently looks like, that you are where you're supposed to be and you're doing what you're supposed to do.
[time=1824] In response to David's waiting patiently in Psalm 40, what does God do?
[time=1831] Verse 1, "He inclined to me and heard my cry."
[time=1838] God's attention is riveted.
[time=1841] I was at dinner with my family this week and I observed another family at a table with small children.
[time=1848] And little boy, I think it was, was going, "Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy."
[time=1855] And she wasn't listening. She wasn't on her phone. She wasn't paying attention.
[time=1858] "Mommy, mommy, mommy." She wasn't listening at all.
[time=1861] That never happens to you, I'm sure. That's very strange sounding to all of you.
[time=1865] That's not what God is like.
[time=1868] Because let's face it, he's got better things to do than answering my prayers, probably.
[time=1874] It's been a rough week around the world. Have you been paying attention?
[time=1878] A rough week.
[time=1880] Praying about my situation doesn't seem like the top of God's list, but he's riveted with attention.
[time=1885] He's inclined. It says that he's bent down to me, like you would listen to a child.
[time=1891] He bent down to listen, to kind of gaze intently.
[time=1894] And listening carefully to what David says.
[time=1899] That's God's response to David's terrible situation, to his cries for help.
[time=1905] But there's more. Verse 2, "He drew me up from the pit of destruction, from the mirey bog,
[time=1916] the mirey clay, as the song we just sang said, out of the mirey clay." Listen, those two things together, the pit of destruction and the mirey bog or clay or whatever it is,
[time=1928] represent together something terribly awfully very bad.
[time=1933] One commentator said, "All that can be suggested of horror and floundering helplessness."
[time=1942] That's the place from which God saved David and probably the place from which he saved you.
[time=1951] The New Living Translation says, calls this the pit of despair, some princess bride.
[time=1957] The slimy pit, the NIV says.
[time=1960] Something about the Hebrew in verse 2, it's like it's the mud of the mud. It's the muddy mud.
[time=1965] It's way down in there.
[time=1967] So David isn't just kind of having a bad time.
[time=1970] Like, "Oh God, I was frustrated and you helped me. I'd be frustrated anymore." I'm having a bad day and I'm having a better day.
[time=1975] He's flailing away, floundering helplessness.
[time=1979] It reminds me of Jeremiah 38.
[time=1983] I'll set the scene.
[time=1985] Jeremiah is a prophet. Remember from Mike? We talked about prophets.
[time=1988] Prophets say hard, truthful things. That's what defines a prophet.
[time=1992] That's what they are at the foundation.
[time=1995] They do tell the future sometimes in the Bible, but more often than not, a prophet just says, truth to power.
[time=2001] Hard truth like King Zedekiah.
[time=2003] So what's Jeremiah say?
[time=2005] Zedekiah, a foreign army will come in and destroy your kingdom and take you away.
[time=2010] And the king's people are like, no, no, no, no.
[time=2013] That's not what's going to happen, Jeremiah.
[time=2015] Give him a good word.
[time=2016] You're seeking our harm, not what's best for us.
[time=2019] And so the king hears this when these guys, like, yeah, I would do whatever you want to him.
[time=2023] And Jeremiah 38 verse 6 says this.
[time=2028] They took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king's son,
[time=2034] which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes.
[time=2038] And there was no water in the cistern, only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.
[time=2047] In a very bad place.
[time=2049] The king later repents and gets him out, but it's a very bad situation.
[time=2054] He doesn't just kind of get you out of the mud and kind of wipe you off and say, okay, go ahead.
[time=2063] Go play.
[time=2064] That's not what he does.
[time=2065] That's not where his deliverance stops.
[time=2068] But what do I deserve?
[time=2070] I deserve someone asked me how I was doing this morning.
[time=2072] I said better than I deserve.
[time=2074] It's something I've heard other people say.
[time=2076] I think it's true of me.
[time=2078] I've said it to you guys before, I'm sure.
[time=2081] Because I deserve to be in the well, in the muddy mud, in the pit of destruction.
[time=2086] That's what my behavior deserves.
[time=2092] And what does God do?
[time=2094] He draws me up.
[time=2095] He listens to me.
[time=2096] He draws me up.
[time=2097] But then there's more.
[time=2099] There's two, set my feet upon a rock and giving me a firm place to go, making my steps secure.
[time=2108] He establishes my footsteps.
[time=2110] He's going to make sure that he provides me all the way.
[time=2114] He gave me a firm place to stand.
[time=2116] He doesn't just save you and say, good luck.
[time=2119] Good luck.
[time=2121] Everywhere that you'll go, he establishes a place for you to be.
[time=2127] God is not obligated to save me.
[time=2130] He's obligated to provide for my needs, but he does both extravagantly.
[time=2137] Charles Spurgeon said this.
[time=2142] Jesus is the true Joseph, taken from the pit to be Lord of all.
[time=2149] It's something more than a sip of sweetness to remember that if we are cast like Jesus,
[time=2156] into the lowest pit of shame and sorrow, we shall by faith rise to stand on the same elevated,
[time=2166] sure, and everlasting rock of divine favor and faithfulness because of what Christ has done.
[time=2175] Wow.
[time=2176] Verse three, but wait, there's more.
[time=2180] He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God.
[time=2187] So number one was Terry, wait.
[time=2192] Letter A was he will save.
[time=2195] Letter B is he will inspire.
[time=2198] He doesn't have to.
[time=2200] He doesn't have to do that, but he does.
[time=2205] David's song doesn't dwell on his ordeal.
[time=2209] It rises up in praise to the Father with a view toward prompting the same thing in other people.
[time=2216] This morning Corbin said that my old song was about me, my new song is about him.
[time=2223] It's true.
[time=2224] It's absolutely true.
[time=2226] Look at Psalm 33.
[time=2229] David wants to bring about, this will be in the screens before you.
[time=2231] David wants to arouse in people fruitful awe.
[time=2238] Think about it that way.
[time=2240] Psalm 33 says, shout for joy in the Lord.
[time=2244] O you righteous.
[time=2246] Praise be fits.
[time=2248] Praise is suiting to the upright.
[time=2250] Give thanks to the Lord with the liar.
[time=2252] Make melody to him with a harp of ten strings.
[time=2255] Sing to him a new song.
[time=2256] Play skillfully on the strings with loud shouts.
[time=2260] Why?
[time=2261] Because the word of the Lord is upright and all his work is done in faithfulness.
[time=2267] He loves righteousness and justice.
[time=2270] The earth is full of the steadfast love of the Lord.
[time=2275] So when God puts a new song in your mouth, a song of praise to our God, verse 3 goes on to say, many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.
[time=2286] The new English translation says, may many see what God has done so they might swear allegiance to him and trust in the Lord.
[time=2296] What is the outcome of your song?
[time=2300] What's happening because of the song?
[time=2303] Is your song about you and all the great things that now you are experiencing?
[time=2309] Or is it about him?
[time=2311] The outcome of the Psalmist's song is praise to the Father and transformed lives around him.
[time=2317] That's evangelism.
[time=2319] More on that later.
[time=2321] Psalm 51 is a familiar song to you as well.
[time=2324] We'll go there a little bit later on.
[time=2325] But I'll tell you the story.
[time=2328] Psalm 51 is a song that David writes in response to what he did with Bathsheba and all of his scheming awfulness.
[time=2340] David is on the roof of his palace.
[time=2343] When kings go out to war, he's not.
[time=2346] He's walking around the roof of his palace.
[time=2348] He's a woman bathing somebody else's wife.
[time=2351] He sends for her, takes her to himself.
[time=2354] She becomes pregnant.
[time=2356] He schemes to have her husband killed.
[time=2358] His name was Uriah, one of his mighty men.
[time=2363] And then covers it up.
[time=2366] In Psalm 51, go there, please.
[time=2369] Psalm 51 is David's response.
[time=2373] After Nathan, the prophet comes to David and tells him a story.
[time=2377] Nathan goes, "Hey, David.
[time=2380] He's a very rich man with lots and lots of possessions and flocks and herds and all of it.
[time=2386] And a poor shepherd came to stay with him who only had this one little U lamb that he loved as his child almost.
[time=2395] And the rich man, while taking this person in, decides to have that U lamb for dinner when he has all this other things he could have provided.
[time=2404] But once the one U lamb for dinner kills it, and David is, of course, outraged.
[time=2410] What?
[time=2411] That guy's going to get it and I'm going to give it to him.
[time=2414] And what's Nathan do?
[time=2416] He points back at him and says, "You're the man." And David just writes Psalm 51.
[time=2424] But look at what it says in verse 15 of Psalm 51.
[time=2428] After he is restored and forgiven and cleansed and washed, what will he do?
[time=2434] Verse 13, "Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you."
[time=2443] That's the outcome.
[time=2444] That's what he wants.
[time=2446] John Piper said that God aims for us to sing other people into the kingdom.
[time=2452] I'll repeat that.
[time=2454] God aims for us to sing other people into the kingdom.
[time=2460] I hope that we all leave here this morning with a song, literally, or else in our minds, in our spirits, a song that we'll sing.
[time=2472] A song that we sing about what we do and by what we don't do, by both.
[time=2476] So wait, friends, wait for God's salvation, and he will then not only save you but inspire you to wonderful and amazing things on behalf of his kingdom and other people.
[time=2491] Number two is trust.
[time=2495] Trust.
[time=2496] Look at verses 4 and 5 here.
[time=2500] "Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his mivtah, his trust."
[time=2510] The idea here is that the psalmist says that a person will be blessed when he places his confidence in God.
[time=2517] I've often said to my students, and I've probably said to you guys at some point before too, that what is most important for us is not the amounts of our faith, but the object of our faith.
[time=2529] What you place your faith in is more important than how much you have.
[time=2534] You can do a lot of damage to people by saying, "You just got to have more faith. If you're sick, have more faith."
[time=2540] You have a job, have more faith.
[time=2543] You're in trouble, have more faith.
[time=2545] Well, how much?
[time=2546] How much is enough for the preacher on TV?
[time=2549] How much is enough for him?
[time=2552] That's not what the Bible says.
[time=2553] The Bible says that what's most important for me is whom I trust, and that he is faithful.
[time=2560] I will be faithless.
[time=2561] It's my default position.
[time=2566] We talked about in Psalm 145, the sense of meditation and focusing on what God's done.
[time=2572] A person who trusts in the Lord will have a focus that keeps lies from crowding in all that interference.
[time=2578] It will be cleared out.
[time=2579] It will go away.
[time=2580] Look at what Psalm 40 says.
[time=2582] Let's look at verses 4 and 5.
[time=2584] "Blessed the man who makes the Lord his trust, who does not turn to the proud to those who go astray after a lie."
[time=2593] That's what someone doesn't do.
[time=2596] The language of verse 5, friends, is overwhelming.
[time=2601] And I'll share this with you here.
[time=2605] Look at verse 5, "You have multiplied, O Lord, my God, your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us."
[time=2618] None can compare with them.
[time=2623] That's not what it says.
[time=2624] None can compare with you.
[time=2627] I will proclaim and tell of them that they are more than can be told.
[time=2632] Here's what blows me away.
[time=2634] What blows me away is that God is this wonderful, acting, awesome, magnificent Heaven enthroned God has thoughts about me.
[time=2651] He's got these multiplied thoughts toward us and plans he's making for our future and he is the incomparable, awesome God.
[time=2660] That's remarkable!
[time=2664] My mom will listen to this sermon, so mom, I apologize wherever you are, mom, for my analogy, but go with me for a second.
[time=2671] My mom used to come to my football games and my basketball games, and she was the loudest.
[time=2677] There was a lot of people there, and she was loud.
[time=2681] When there was an injustice, when the ref missed a call, she was there.
[time=2686] Hey, you know, and I think that that gave me, my mom loves me.
[time=2692] She wants what's best for me, and so she always has been my number one encourager.
[time=2698] And for that mom, I thank you, and I am day by day strengthened by it.
[time=2703] But I think I take it for granted.
[time=2706] She's my mom.
[time=2707] That's what moms do.
[time=2709] Moms encourage their kids, or they should.
[time=2713] And I think about God and his inclination toward me and how I should, I don't expect it at all.
[time=2721] The fact that he even knows my name is remarkable, but that goes way farther than that.
[time=2728] The two things in your outline for number two are letter A, his thoughts toward us.
[time=2733] Remember Psalm 139 from last week, his thoughts, and letter B, none can compare.
[time=2741] Those two things together are just overwhelming.
[time=2745] The incomparable God is in control of the past and the future.
[time=2750] What has happened to you is under God's control.
[time=2757] Psalm 139 said in verses 17 and 18, how precious to me are your thoughts.
[time=2765] Oh God, how vast is the sum of them.
[time=2771] If I would count them, they are more than the sand.
[time=2774] I awake, and I am still with you.
[time=2778] God's thoughts are like the sand of the seashore, and they're in some part directed toward me.
[time=2786] It's amazing.
[time=2790] The Psalmist's response, even though God's wondrous deeds and his thoughts are like sand,
[time=2796] is to proclaim and tell of them.
[time=2798] That's his response.
[time=2800] Even though there are so many and they're so awesome, I'm still going to talk about him.
[time=2805] He's not speechless.
[time=2806] He's not struck.
[time=2807] I just got nothing to say.
[time=2808] It's not his response.
[time=2810] Number three, in the outline.
[time=2813] I fudged a bit here with the teas, but okay.
[time=2818] Take joy is number three.
[time=2821] Take joy.
[time=2823] Excuse me.
[time=2824] Terry, wait.
[time=2827] Trust.
[time=2829] Take joy.
[time=2830] Number three.
[time=2831] This is remarkable.
[time=2832] Look at verse 6 of Psalm 40.
[time=2837] In sacrifice and offering, excuse me, you have not delighted.
[time=2841] You've given me an open ear.
[time=2843] Burnt offering and sin offering, you've not required.
[time=2846] Then I said, behold, I've come in the scroll of the book.
[time=2849] It's written of me, I delight to do your will.
[time=2853] Oh, my God.
[time=2854] Your law is within my heart.
[time=2858] What the Psalmist delights in and what God delights in are both, what God doesn't delight in, are both in view here.
[time=2865] It's not.
[time=2866] God wants you to know what he loves, and he wants you to love what he loves.
[time=2870] The idea in verse 6, friends, is that this is not what God wants.
[time=2877] So mere sacrifice, mere offering, that's not what he wants.
[time=2882] We're going to give our tithes and offerings here in a few minutes.
[time=2887] And God's desire for your tithe and your offering is not that you would give it from some kind
[time=2893] of duty and because I have to.
[time=2896] And here I go, but that it would be joyful, that it would be cheerful.
[time=2901] Because what's behind that?
[time=2903] Obedience and loyalty.
[time=2907] And from that comes proper sacrifices, but not leading.
[time=2911] It's not driving the bus.
[time=2914] There was never his intention.
[time=2916] Sacrifice and offerings apart from genuine allegiance are meaningless, meaningless.
[time=2922] And they always have been all the way back to Leviticus.
[time=2925] It was always God's heart.
[time=2928] It says that God gave the psalmist in verse 6 an open ear.
[time=2936] A ear that was ready to listen and obey.
[time=2941] I hope that you'll do both today, friends.
[time=2943] I hope that you're listening and that you'll walk out from here today ready to be obedient.
[time=2948] That's my prayer for me too, for all of us, for each one of us.
[time=2954] Isaiah 50 verses 4 through 6 says this.
[time=2962] The Lord God has given me the tongue of those who are taught.
[time=2966] Why?
[time=2968] So I'll be better and I'll have my act together.
[time=2972] No, that I may know how to sustain with a word him who is weary.
[time=2978] Morning by morning he awakens, he awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.
[time=2988] Keep reading verse 5.
[time=2990] The Lord God has opened my ear.
[time=2992] I was not rebellious.
[time=2993] I turned not backward.
[time=2995] I gave my back to those who strike and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard.
[time=3000] I hid not my face from disgrace and spitting.
[time=3009] Hebrews 10 quotes Psalm 40, 6 through 8 of Jesus and says that Jesus said these verses
[time=3018] when he came into the world.
[time=3020] So we're seeing the experience of the psalmist as a pointer to Jesus in the future, the one
[time=3028] who would be perfectly obedient and perfectly loyal and offer for us on our behalf the
[time=3034] only sufficient sacrifice for our sins.
[time=3038] Hallelujah for all he's done.
[time=3040] What has he done?
[time=3041] If he had only done that, if he had only made provisioned for wicked sinful people like
[time=3049] me to be in right relationship with himself, that deserves hymnals full of songs.
[time=3056] But he's done more than that, hasn't he?
[time=3060] Hasn't he?
[time=3061] Okay.
[time=3062] Out of the pit and what?
[time=3064] Out of the pit and a firm place to stand and places to go and things to say.
[time=3071] Hallelujah for all he's done, amen to that.
[time=3078] Look at verse 7 and 8.
[time=3083] I desire to do your will, verse 8, oh my God, your law is within my heart.
[time=3090] John Owen said this and I'll translate it for you, I just can't not say it.
[time=3095] He said, all love in general has an assimilating efficacy, what in the world does that mean?
[time=3104] It means that you become like that which you love.
[time=3109] Hating efficacy means it will make you like the thing that you love and it will be good at it.
[time=3115] Efficacy means it will happen.
[time=3117] All love has an assimilating efficacy.
[time=3121] Don't you love it when you see people who are older, been married for 60 years, they begin to actually in some cases look like each other.
[time=3130] Have you ever noticed that before?
[time=3131] I think it's wonderful.
[time=3132] I'll book my wife another way around when we're married for many years, so it doesn't go the other way.
[time=3139] Three approach to God by ardent love and delight is transfiguring, he said.
[time=3147] I desire to do your will, oh my God, your law is within my heart.
[time=3151] Psalm 119 says your word, I have treasured in my heart that I may not sin against you.
[time=3161] And the outline, Roman numeral three, the two things to say there are letter A, obedience
[time=3167] is better.
[time=3171] Obedience is better than mere ritual than mere going through the motions.
[time=3176] Sometimes there's a place for being obedient when you don't want to be obedient.
[time=3179] I get that.
[time=3180] But behind all of that is a real genuine heartfelt desire to please him.
[time=3186] It's more important to be devoted than to do devotions.
[time=3190] Because out of your devoted spirit comes attention to God's word, comes a meditating in prayer, comes all of those things.
[time=3198] And letter B is treasure his word, treasure his word.
[time=3207] The Hebrew in verse 8 says something like your law is in the midst of my inner parts.
[time=3213] So nothing can get to it.
[time=3214] It's way down in there.
[time=3220] That word have I treasured, have I hid in my heart?
[time=3222] Maybe that's a version that sounds more familiar to you.
[time=3225] You hide it in there, you treasure it in there.
[time=3228] So when liars come and pride wants to steal away your affections and your heart just will have no effect.
[time=3237] The appropriate response to all of this is number four and tell.
[time=3243] Terry, wait, trust, take joy, number three.
[time=3248] And lastly, here number four friends is tell, he has given you things to say.
[time=3257] I hope that you are busy saying them.
[time=3261] Look at verses 9 and 10, I'm not making it up.
[time=3264] I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation.
[time=3270] I have not restrained my lips, oh my Lord.
[time=3276] As you know, Lord, I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart.
[time=3281] I have told, I have not restrained.
[time=3283] I have not hidden, I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation.
[time=3289] I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness from the great congregation.
[time=3296] John Calvin said, a dog barks when his master is attacked.
[time=3301] I would be a coward if I saw that God's truth is attacked and yet would remain silent.
[time=3311] That's what we're called to do.
[time=3312] How, Steve?
[time=3314] How?
[time=3314] I don't know.
[time=3317] But the same spirit that dwells in you inspired David to write these words and he will tell you how if you listen.
[time=3325] Guys, this glad news of deliverance is just worth talking about.
[time=3330] I hope you think so.
[time=3331] The glad news of deliverance is worth talking about.
[time=3336] It's a story worth telling.
[time=3339] That's letter A in your outline, glad news of deliverance.
[time=3347] By the way, that word for glad news here is all over the end of Isaiah, which happens
[time=3353] to be about the suffering servant, which who happens to come on our behalf and satisfy
[time=3359] all of God's demands for us.
[time=3362] Just so happens to be that way.
[time=3364] Gospel.
[time=3365] It's the same word that we use translated as gospel.
[time=3367] It's the same word.
[time=3371] It's God's favor, his acceptance.
[time=3373] It's glad tidings.
[time=3375] It's good news.
[time=3379] Are you telling the glad news of deliverance, preach the gospel, use words if necessary?
[time=3385] I don't know.
[time=3387] These words, they are necessary.
[time=3390] I want to end with reading Psalm 98.
[time=3396] It seems like a good response to all this.
[time=3400] Psalm 98, what am I supposed to do?
[time=3404] So takeaways from this morning.
[time=3406] Just listen to Psalm 98, and I promise you there are lots of things there.
[time=3413] Psalm 98, as our response to the Lord, O sing to the Lord a new song, for he has done marvelous
[time=3423] things.
[time=3425] His right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.
[time=3431] The Lord has made known his salvation.
[time=3433] He has revealed his righteousness in the sight of the nations.
[time=3437] He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness to the house of Israel.
[time=3443] All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
[time=3446] Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth.
[time=3451] Break forth into joyous song and sing praises.
[time=3457] Sing praises to the Lord with the liar, the liar, the sound of melody, trumpets, the sound of the horn.
[time=3463] Make a joyful noise before the king, the Lord.
[time=3468] But the sea roar and all that fills it, the world and those who dwell in it, but the rivers
[time=3474] clap their hands, the hills sing for joy together before the Lord, for he comes to judge
[time=3481] the earth.
[time=3482] He will judge the world with righteousness, the peoples with equity.
