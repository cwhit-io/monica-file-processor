[time=488] - Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=494] It is, as always, really good to have you with us and I'm thankful for a few minutes to spend with you talking about what you're gonna see today in the broadcast in our message.
[time=504] I was thinking about it on the way in this morning that this passage that we come to in First Timothy 2 where it talks very specifically about the roles and the function of men and women in the local church is a passage that has been much debated over the years.
[time=522] And while so many times the focus, I think in our day, when it comes to this passage about men and women in the church, so many times the focus is on what women aren't supposed to do.
[time=536] I think while the focus goes there, we overlook the fact that there's a really amazing truth and a really great principle for us to see on the front of what men are supposed to do.
[time=549] I think sometimes we focus on what women aren't to do and we miss the great importance and the great message here in First Timothy 2 about men and the thing they're supposed to give themselves to, the way they're supposed to posture themselves in the life of a local church.
[time=567] And while we'll talk about the role of a woman in the local church and specifically in leadership today, I want to encourage you men who are a part of local churches.
[time=578] I want to encourage you men who are married because the fact is what it takes for a man to be successful in marriage.
[time=588] What it takes for a man to make a healthy contribution to a local church is one and the same.
[time=596] As you go back to Genesis 3, you see that the root of this whole thing comes in the relationship that God gave a man and a woman and the roles and the function they were to exercise.
[time=608] And so guys, I hope you'll pay attention today.
[time=610] I hope you'll listen closely to the challenge that God's word has for you on how He designed you as a man to function in a marriage and in a church as well.
[time=621] I think it's insightful.
[time=623] I think it's absolutely life-changing.
[time=625] And I hope you'll allow the Spirit of God and the Word of God to do its mighty work in your heart and life today.
[time=632] Hey, thank you for tuning in.
[time=633] We're having a great time making our way through first Timothy.
[time=637] I hope you'll come and visit us soon.
[time=639] I hope you'll come and meet us face-to-face.
[time=640] We'd love to get to know you better.
[time=642] I hope you're encouraged today.
[time=644] Have a great day.
[time=645] Have a great week.
[time=646] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=649] [MUSIC]
[time=651] Long after the tears fall, I'm still your child.
[time=670] I put down my defenses and laid out my pride.
[time=677] Love and forgiveness flow deep and light.
[time=683] So I'll run to you and surrender all
[time=690] as I lay down my life and pick up my cross.
[time=697] What a joy it has to give my life away to you.
[time=704] All that I need and all that I seek
[time=711] is you here with me, only spirit, have your way in me.
[time=720] In times of trouble, though trials may come.
[time=732] The rock of ages is standing strong.
[time=739] I'm fighting chaos, but the war is run so I'll run to you
[time=748] and surrender all as I lay down my life and pick up my cross.
[time=760] What a joy it has to give my life away to you.
[time=767] All that I need and all that I seek is you here with me,
[time=776] only spirit, have your way in me.
[time=788] All of you, and bless of me, God, all of you.
[time=798] And bless of me, God, all of you.
[time=811] All of you, and bless of me, only spirit, have your way in me.
[time=821] And bless of me, God, all of you.
[time=828] What a joy it has to give my life away to you.
[time=832] All that I need and all that I seek
[time=839] is you here with me, only spirit, have your way in me.
[time=849] Oh, yeah, only spirit, have your way in me.
[time=869] Open your Bibles if you would this morning to 1 Timothy 2.
[time=877] We continue on in our series that we've entitled True Church.
[time=881] God's design, God's design for the body, God's design for the body of Christ.
[time=888] And we come this morning to a passage 1 Timothy 2 verses 8 through 15,
[time=894] having to do with men and women and their role and their function in the body of Christ.
[time=902] Men and women in the church.
[time=905] God's design as it relates to their place, their role, their function.
[time=910] Who can do what? Who can't?
[time=912] How is it that God has uniquely designed men and women and the ministry of the church?
[time=919] How has he designed for us as men and women to make a unique and significant contribution to the ministry of the church according to his plan and his will, both for men and for women.
[time=934] Now, this certainly has been a hot button over the years in the discussion of church leadership
[time=940] and ministry practice.
[time=942] My friends, I have watched in 20 plus years of ministry this men and women in the church issue.
[time=948] I've watched it be divisive at times.
[time=951] I've seen it split churches right down the middle.
[time=955] I've watched it be controversial to say the least.
[time=959] I've seen people argue and fight over these things.
[time=962] I've watched it be destructive both personally and corporately.
[time=967] The way the issue of men and women and their respective roles within the body has been handled
[time=973] has been in many cases utterly tragic.
[time=976] Personal opinion has at times crept in.
[time=979] We've seen social agendas pushed.
[time=983] Ministry policies have been rooted in fear instead of the great truth of the Holy Scriptures.
[time=990] We've seen man's ideas on this issue take away from what God has clearly communicated to men and women in the church.
[time=1003] Well, hey, this morning, let me just right up front.
[time=1005] Let me ask you not to be if you could for the sake of our discussion in this study.
[time=1011] Let me ask you if you could not be predisposed as we venture into this teaching.
[time=1017] Let me ask you to not jump into this dialogue with your mind made up or your defensive or wounded guns loaded.
[time=1026] Can I do that?
[time=1027] Let me ask you right up front to read this passage with me prayerfully and carefully.
[time=1033] And would you allow me as your pastor and teacher to take you through this passage word by word,
[time=1041] verse by verse, truth by truth, principle by principle?
[time=1045] And can we together just beg God and the Spirit of God and the Word of God to reveal to us his intended truth on this matter?
[time=1054] Will you do that? Second Timothy, first Timothy, excuse me, first Timothy 2, verses 8 to 15.
[time=1060] And would you in honor of God's word stand and allow me to read this for us this morning?
[time=1067] Paul writes to Timothy there at the church in Ephesus.
[time=1072] He says, "Timothy, therefore I want men in every place to pray,
[time=1078] lifting up holy hands without wrath and dissension.
[time=1083] Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing modestly and discreetly,
[time=1091] not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments, but rather by," but rather that refers back to how they adorn themselves.
[time=1104] What makes them beautiful, but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women making a claim to godliness.
[time=1115] A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness, but I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.
[time=1127] For it was Adam who was first created and then Eve, and it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being deceived fell into transgression, but women will be preserved through the bearing of children
[time=1139] if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.
[time=1147] Father in heaven, our prayer this morning as we come to your scriptures yet again is that you and your word and all of its power
[time=1156] would help us to understand that which you have intended for us here.
[time=1162] You are not a god of confusion.
[time=1165] You are a god of great wisdom and love, God.
[time=1169] Your design is perfect because it's from you.
[time=1173] I pray, God, that we could see and study and understand this in a way that would not only bring clarity,
[time=1180] but God in a way that would make a difference in our lives, in our church, in the way that we live and relate to you.
[time=1187] God, thank you for this truth.
[time=1189] Bless us, God, and grow us as we interact with it.
[time=1193] In your son's name we pray.
[time=1195] [AMEN] You can have a seat.
[time=1198] Now, before we jump into all that we just read, really in light of what we just read,
[time=1205] I think it's important that we go back on this issue of men and women in the church.
[time=1210] Very important, I think that we go back to Genesis chapter three.
[time=1213] So would you do that?
[time=1214] Would you open your Bibles and turn back to Genesis chapter three and what was, like it or not,
[time=1221] a very defining moment for all men and women who have ever lived.
[time=1227] A very defining moment for all men and women back to a passage in Genesis chapter three
[time=1235] that really does, while it is foundational in terms of God's overall redemptive story,
[time=1241] it is a passage that really does shed great light on our topic this morning, the topic that Paul raises in 1 Timothy 2 and the role of men and women in the life of the local church.
[time=1253] As you go back to Genesis three, again, just a brief backdrop.
[time=1257] Most of you in the room know others if you may not.
[time=1259] This is the initial confrontation between evil and good.
[time=1264] This is when Satan in the form of a serpent comes and brings temptation to Eve.
[time=1270] The story is again widely known.
[time=1273] It's a real story.
[time=1275] It really happened.
[time=1276] It's not myth.
[time=1278] The enemy comes to do his very best to move Adam and Eve away from what was right and true and good.
[time=1286] And I want to pick it up in Genesis three, six.
[time=1288] And what I want you to see as we read Genesis three, six.
[time=1292] And what I want you to see is where they, the man and the woman enter into sin.
[time=1296] I want you to see where they break from God's design.
[time=1299] It says in three, six.
[time=1301] It says when the woman saw having had the discussion with Satan, with the serpent, when she saw that the tree, the one they weren't supposed to eat from, was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was desirable to make one wise.
[time=1326] She took from its fruit and what church say it, eight.
[time=1331] And she gave also to her husband who was obviously there.
[time=1336] And she gave also to her husband with her and he, what, say it church, he ate.
[time=1345] And there in that moment sin enters into the world.
[time=1349] Sin enters into the hearts and lives of these two.
[time=1353] And there in that moment Romans teaches us sin enters into your heart and life as well.
[time=1361] What I want you to see here as it relates to our passage in 1 Timothy is what it was that Eve rebelled from, what it was that Adam rebelled from.
[time=1372] I want you to see them and how they break away from God's design.
[time=1377] Let's start with Eve.
[time=1380] Eve was, I want you to see this, I don't know that this will be on the screen, but I want you to look at 3/5 to 20.
[time=1388] Genesis 2/20.
[time=1390] I want you to see what Eve moves away from, how she breaks from God's design and enters into sin because it says really clearly who are here in 2/20.
[time=1400] It says the man gave names to all the cattle and to the birds of the sky and to every beast of the field.
[time=1408] But for Adam, are you there?
[time=1410] But for Adam there was not found a what?
[time=1414] Everybody say it loudly.
[time=1417] Helper, okay this is really important.
[time=1420] This is really kind of at the crux of what Eve moves away from.
[time=1423] God's design for Eve, God's design for Adam, God's design for woman in this relationship between her and Adam, man, was that she would be, here's the word right here, his helper.
[time=1449] Now, I've been saying that, I've been reading that, I've been trying to teach that for 22, 23 years.
[time=1457] Every time I say that word in a restaurant booth in my office in front of hundreds of people, there is almost every time I can feel it in the room and I can feel it just then when I said it, there's this negative connotation that comes with that word that I sense from people.
[time=1478] When I'm having conversations about it and I say God's design for Eve was that he made her initially and primarily to be Adam's helper, you get the sense of awe, that's demeaning.
[time=1493] That's diminishing, that's chauvinistic, that's whatever word you want to put with that.
[time=1500] But there is this sense that somehow that we would communicate God's design that Eve would be Adam's helper somehow we're putting her in a bad light and I want you to listen to the word.
[time=1513] Adam needed a helper. What does that really say?
[time=1525] Who's weak in that terminology and who's strong?
[time=1535] And this is before sin. This is man in his perfect God ordained state made in the image of God and God is saying this perfect man who was unblemished by sin at this point needs a helper.
[time=1557] He is by nature weak and insufficient and he needs someone to bring to him unique strengths and abilities and investment. Does this make any sense?
[time=1573] It is the opposite of diminishing. It shows the unique and powerful creative mind of God and the role that he had for Eve, he knew Adam couldn't get it done alone.
[time=1588] He was not sufficient. He was not almighty. He was not all powerful. He needed help from someone who could bring it and someone who could bring it well, who could bring it right.
[time=1606] He lifts women up by the use of the word helper. He doesn't degrade them. He doesn't diminish them. Amen?
[time=1618] God designed Eve to help Adam who desperately needed the help. God designed Eve to come under God's care and provision. He designed Eve to come under and alongside Adam.
[time=1634] And I want you to understand as you look at this passage that what Eve wanted, that what Eve desired was independence. She didn't and she interacts with the serpent as she thinks this thing through.
[time=1649] She wants independence designed to be under and helping Adam as Adam provides her with loving protection and sacrificial care. She didn't want to help Adam.
[time=1663] She wanted to help herself. This is how it goes. She wanted and desired independence and don't miss this. Just write this one down as well. She really is.
[time=1673] You watch the passage unfold. She wanted control. Would you write that down? She wanted control.
[time=1681] The serpent says to her in the serpent says in 3-4, the serpent said to the woman you surely will not die. For God, this is so key. Listen, church.
[time=1693] For God knows, serpent speaking, that in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you, Eve, woman, you will be like, who say it, church? God.
[time=1706] Knowing, knowing good and evil. My friends Eve in this instance wanted to be like God. There was something in woman that wanted to be in charge.
[time=1723] He wanted to be in charge and he says if you just eat of the fruit, you will know. You will know it all. You will be a know it all.
[time=1739] It was sort of funny, sort of serious. Eve wanted and desired independence and control. Adam, my friends just wanted to stay out of it.
[time=1752] Adam just wanted, write it down. Adam wanted silent passivity. Silent passivity.
[time=1760] And this is really interesting. Steve Webster and I had a chance to look this over during the week. We had a fantastic time just being reminded of how God designed Adam.
[time=1769] I don't know when the last time it was that you read Genesis chapter 2, but let me just take you back. When in actuality, he wants silent passivity. When in actuality, God designed for man the absolute opposite.
[time=1784] Look at Genesis 2, 15. Watch this. Watch this progression. This is just fascinating and powerful.
[time=1793] Then the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and to keep it.
[time=1802] I want you to write some words down here. Number one, I want you to write down God made man responsible.
[time=1807] One of the first words that pops onto the scene, when you think about the way God designed Adam, the design God has for men, he designed Adam to be responsible.
[time=1819] Number one, for work and provision, it was Adam's responsibility by God to oversee, cultivate, and work the entire garden of Eden.
[time=1829] This was an enormous undertaking. It says it right there in the Scriptures to cultivate it and keep it.
[time=1837] Responsibility, then verse 16, then it says the Lord God commanded the man saying, "From any tree of the garden you may eat freely."
[time=1847] "From the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day you eat from it you will surely die."
[time=1856] He says this to Adam. I bet if I surveyed this entire room and I asked all of you, "Who did God say you shall not eat from the tree?"
[time=1875] Who did God say that to? 85 to 90 percent of you would have said he said it to Adam and Eve.
[time=1885] He didn't say it to Eve. Eve wasn't even created yet.
[time=1893] God takes the most important, up to this point, I know we're early on, but He takes the most important divine truth that had connected to it.
[time=1903] Everything, everything's at stake as it relates to this divine truth and He gives that divine truth to Adam.
[time=1913] Responsibility for the garden, yes, but for spiritual oversight. He places the opportunity and responsibility clearly on man's shoulders.
[time=1926] She's not even around. And when she comes around and she does know about it, because in the temptation discourse she says to the serpent, "This is what God said."
[time=1938] Well, she knew that's what God said because her husband told her because he communicated in his unfallen state.
[time=1947] He communicated the things that mattered most. We see God giving man responsibility for work and provision.
[time=1956] We see him giving man responsibility for spiritual oversight and then look, look, the passage just keeps going.
[time=1962] Then the Lord God said to Adam, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make him a helper suitable for him."
[time=1969] And out of the ground, oftentimes we miss that. Do you remember this? Out of the ground, the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky and brought them to the man to see what he would call them.
[time=1984] God brings all the beasts of the field and the sky to Adam to see what Adam would call them. It's interesting.
[time=1998] And whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name. The man gave names to all the cattle, the birds of the sky and to every beast of the field.
[time=2009] Responsibility for authority. God gave Adam authority over everything.
[time=2016] He gives him responsibility to work and provide. He gives him spiritual oversight responsibility and he gives him authority.
[time=2022] God made man first and he made him first so that he could deliver this kind of responsibility and oversight to him because that was God's design.
[time=2035] Eve, Eve, when tempted, wanted to step out from under the place God had designed, she wanted to step out from under and instead lead.
[time=2046] She wanted to rule. She wanted to speak. She wanted authority. She wants out from this design and Adam was all too willing to abdicate it, to let her lead, to have her step out in front because truthfully, you know what? Guess what Adam wanted.
[time=2066] It's all said and done. He just wanted to watch the game. Funny, but what? True.
[time=2078] He just wanted a little more time on the computer. I'll come to bed later. You just do what you're going to do.
[time=2095] And since that day, it hasn't changed one bit. Since that day, the struggle has been consistent. It hasn't changed at all.
[time=2110] A desire to come out from under, a willingness to abdicate and be quiet.
[time=2115] It's interesting. I was talking to Jesse Hanna, lead pastor over all of our student ministries and Jesse and I were talking this week. Actually, we were talking as a staff, I believe, and Jesse mentioned that they had actually talked to our young men in student ministries lately.
[time=2128] And they had actually asked a room full of young men to just respond to the question, "What is a real man? What is a real man? What does that look like? What do real men do?"
[time=2144] He said it was actually disappointing and concerning. It was a great opportunity, but the fact was he said no one said a word.
[time=2156] Your boys in mind. And nobody had anything to say. Partly because they're boys and sometimes on these subjects, it's hard to get men to speak. And partly because they just don't know today.
[time=2172] Because the messages that they've heard and the things that they have seen can be for a 13, 14, 15, 16 year old young man extremely confusing.
[time=2182] I'm so grateful that Jesse taught them what they taught them that night. We've seen this material before. It's a phenomenal curriculum right out of the scriptures called a modern day, raising a modern day night.
[time=2197] And in that material, I want you just to look at the screen. I'll just have them all put up there at once. Here's what our young men got taught recently that a real man rejects passivity.
[time=2208] A real man doesn't sit back on the computer. A real man doesn't just watch the game. The real man doesn't just when things get dicey, when things get tight, when things are confusing.
[time=2221] Every man in this room knows as well as the one you're looking at that our tendency as men with wives and kids and friends is when it gets confusing, we tend to want to back up.
[time=2235] We don't know what to say, so sometimes we don't say anything at all.
[time=2241] And in the midst of that, we move away from God's design. We want to teach our young men that real men reject passivity.
[time=2250] They accept responsibility. They don't step backwards. They move forward. They accept responsibility for her, for them, for friendships and for spiritual truth going forward.
[time=2261] They may make a mess of it, but at least they're stepping forward. Make something.
[time=2269] But go forward. Don't retreat. They lead courageously. It's hard as a man sometimes.
[time=2277] In the face of all that swirls around in our minds, we need courage to step forward into her life.
[time=2283] We need courage to say no to them at times. We need courage to explain to them why we're saying no.
[time=2291] And then accept God's reward. God's reward comes to men who live and function along those lines. I hope you wrote those down.
[time=2300] God's design for Adam and God's design for Eve. Now, here we go. First Timothy 2. I'm going to fast forward to God's design for something else he created.
[time=2313] The church. The church. And one thing that stands out when you look at God's creation of mankind and you look at God's creation of the church, both of them were in great need of something that he provides by virtue of his design and that is order.
[time=2330] The church and creation both had order. And God knowing the tendencies that all you eaves and all us atoms have, he says here, here's how I want this church thing to work.
[time=2344] This is how I want it to play out. Here are the functions that I have for you eaves and you atoms. And here's what we're about to see.
[time=2353] What you're about to see is that Godly men, I hope you'll write this down, Godly men step forward and engage. Godly men step forward and engage.
[time=2364] Men desiring to fulfill the function that God gave them in the church, roll up their sleeves and get involved.
[time=2373] They lean into, not away from these opportunities. And here's what you'll hear and this is what we'll study as far as Godly women.
[time=2384] They respectfully, as it relates to the men, they respectfully let them. They allow that to happen. They don't do anything to get in the way of men responding to God's call on their lives and their opportunities.
[time=2401] God given opportunities in the body of Christ. Godly women allow them and Godly women don't demand for themselves those roles that God and His sovereignty gave to men.
[time=2416] Godly women don't usurp. They don't take away from the God given responsibility. So let's look at God's design for men and God's design for women in the life of the local church.
[time=2430] I want you to come back with me to verse 8, if you will. Back to 1 Timothy, 1 Timothy chapter 2 verse 8, it says, "Therefore, I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without wrath and dissension.
[time=2449] Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments, but rather by means of good works as is proper for women making a claim to godliness." Did you see it?
[time=2471] To pick that up there, right out of the gate. God addresses the sinful bent, the sinful bent of all men and all women, and at the same time clearly addresses some of the bents of those men and women that were there with Timothy at Ephesus, and this is very important for you to understand as we get into this.
[time=2493] While God uses, I believe, Paul's message here to Timothy in 1 Timothy 2, 8 to 15, while God uses that to deliver to his people his design, his general and important will and design for how this is to look, he is at the same time also as he does throughout the pastoral epistles, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, he's addressing specific issues.
[time=2520] There were problems at Ephesus, Timothy was struggling, and I just want you to see that while this is, yes, this is God delivering his will for this topic, it is also God addressing specific issues that were showing themselves in the life of that church there at Ephesus.
[time=2540] Men weren't doing what men should do, women were doing things women shouldn't do, it was all backwards and so he writes to correct as well as to deliver his will.
[time=2552] Guys, look at verse 8, "Therefore I want men in every place to pray."
[time=2560] First, I just think it's important to note who does he start with?
[time=2564] Guys, who does he start with in this discussion?
[time=2568] He starts with men because he knows and the foundation of his design for you pick.
[time=2576] Husband and wife, the way the church is to function, there's similarity, there's connection.
[time=2581] Men are to be what God called them to be if this thing is ever going to work out well.
[time=2588] Men in every place pray.
[time=2591] Important about that verse is two things.
[time=2594] Number one, men in every place, the text here clearly points to the activity of the church when it's together.
[time=2600] In whatever place, men in every place, that word place gives it location.
[time=2606] That word place means whatever doors you walk through.
[time=2609] That word place means whenever that body, whoever you are, wherever you are, when it's gathered, the men in that gathering are to pray.
[time=2620] Lifting up holy hands without wrath or dissension.
[time=2624] In unity, in harmony, the men in every place as that place gathers are to pray.
[time=2633] Now interesting, the word men there isn't the word for deacon, it's not the word for elder, it's not the word for church leader.
[time=2640] The Greek word for men there is the word for men.
[time=2645] Just men.
[time=2647] And this is so cool, you say, well, okay, well, how are we supposed to do that?
[time=2652] What's that supposed to look like?
[time=2655] Guess what?
[time=2657] It's not here.
[time=2660] And that's the great beauty of God's word at times.
[time=2663] There are times where it is specifically clear on how things are to look.
[time=2667] In this case, all we know is that every one of you men, when we gather in this place, we should be praying.
[time=2676] And many connect that praying back to the beginning of our passage where it talked about in treaties and prayers
[time=2684] and petitions and thanksgivings on behalf of all men.
[time=2689] Now I want you to understand, he's not saying women can't pray.
[time=2696] Does it say that?
[time=2698] Yes or no?
[time=2699] It doesn't say women can't pray.
[time=2701] What he's saying is that men should.
[time=2705] That's what he's saying.
[time=2707] And that's all he's saying.
[time=2709] Men should.
[time=2710] He wants men to pray.
[time=2713] He sees it as a value and a benefit when the body's gathered.
[time=2717] And I think he knows this too.
[time=2722] I think he knows that left to themselves, men probably wouldn't.
[time=2730] Left to ourselves, we probably, what, wouldn't?
[time=2735] I've sat with couples and tried my best to help people in marriage situations and family situations for over 22, 23 years.
[time=2746] I've been married almost 24.
[time=2749] I've seen it in others and I've seen it in me.
[time=2754] One of the great disappointments of wives, of good men, many of whom try hard.
[time=2764] Some of them don't.
[time=2766] But one of the great disappointments of wives, when you look them in the eye and you say, what do you wish was different?
[time=2774] They would look you right back in the eye and say, I wish he would pray.
[time=2780] I wish he would pray with me.
[time=2782] I wish he would say something to me.
[time=2786] I wish on the spiritual front there was a level of engagement.
[time=2791] I know I'm confusing, shall say.
[time=2793] I know I'm hard.
[time=2795] I know it's scary.
[time=2798] But I wish he would have or I wish he would step into that and say something.
[time=2805] Pray for me, pray with me, pray with them at night.
[time=2810] And there we are, a bunch of atoms at times, just so hesitant to lean into it.
[time=2820] I don't think I've ever seen it more powerfully illustrated.
[time=2824] First Timothy 2.8, I want the men in every place to pray, then went about 10 years ago or so.
[time=2832] Our staff had the privilege of being invited to New York City and specifically to Brooklyn.
[time=2839] And our entire staff and our spouses got to come with us and we were able to visit different ministries in that area.
[time=2846] But one of the ministries we got to visit with was Pastor Jim Simba at the Brooklyn Tabernacle.
[time=2851] Maybe you've heard of the Brooklyn Tabernacle, an amazing place, thousands and thousands of people right there in the heart of Brooklyn,
[time=2858] being a difference every day for the kingdom, a ministry that really has.
[time=2863] We talked about this a few weeks ago, different ministries are known for different things.
[time=2867] God has in God's sovereignty and provision he has chosen to use Brooklyn Tab on the prayer front.
[time=2873] They are a praying people.
[time=2875] They are a praying church.
[time=2877] And they have allowed themselves through prayer to come under God's leadership.
[time=2882] And there is a sensitivity there to him and his spirit and the opportunities that exist there in Brooklyn.
[time=2887] It's an amazing thing.
[time=2888] We met with Pastor Simba one night before their Tuesday prayer meeting.
[time=2892] They have church on the weekends, but then they have a prayer night on Tuesdays.
[time=2896] Thousands of people come.
[time=2898] But before the prayer service, we had about an hour in between.
[time=2903] Few of us staff guys are walking around and we realize there is noise in the worship center.
[time=2907] We walk into the worship center an hour early.
[time=2910] There is probably 500 men up at the altar praying out loud kind of all together for their church and for their city and for that community.
[time=2924] And it was amazing next to many of the men were little guys, sons.
[time=2931] And there was a lady crying in the, lady crying in one of the pews and one of our staff guys.
[time=2938] We were there and somebody said something and you know, are you okay?
[time=2941] And she said, oh, I'm fine.
[time=2943] I'm beyond fine.
[time=2944] She said, she's crying.
[time=2946] She's weeping.
[time=2947] She says, my husband's up there.
[time=2948] I've prayed for five years that he would be willing to lead our family.
[time=2952] And he's up there with my two boys and it was an amazing sight.
[time=2957] Many says to us as many.
[time=2959] In essence, he says dial it up.
[time=2962] Don't step back.
[time=2963] Roll up your sleeves.
[time=2964] Roll up your engagement.
[time=2966] Roll, step up your involvement.
[time=2968] He says to men, dial it up.
[time=2970] And he says, interestingly enough, he says to women, having said that to men in verse eight.
[time=2975] In verse nine, he in essence says to women on a different front, dial it back.
[time=2981] Dial it back.
[time=2982] Be careful, he says to ladies in the local assembly.
[time=2987] He says, be very careful.
[time=2989] He says, verse nine, he says likewise.
[time=2992] I've just talked to men.
[time=2994] I've told men that there's something that's going on that really needs to change and likewise
[time=3000] in verse nine.
[time=3001] I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly.
[time=3008] Let me try and get this in here this morning.
[time=3011] In Ephesus with its promiscuous, sexually immoral culture, and I've just got to say this, right?
[time=3018] Does that sound familiar?
[time=3020] I'm going to keep saying that to you.
[time=3022] I've said it when we study the Ephesians.
[time=3024] I'm going to say it to you again this morning, ladies, young women.
[time=3029] In an immoral, promiscuous, sexually inundated culture, women in the church were beginning
[time=3043] to be influenced by culture instead of them influencing culture.
[time=3048] Women in the church were disrupting the climate of worship.
[time=3052] They were distracting to the worship environment and that they were drawing attention to themselves,
[time=3058] to their bodies and to their wardrobe.
[time=3063] And he says in verse nine, I want you to write just a few words down.
[time=3067] Three, here's one, adorn.
[time=3068] He says, adorn.
[time=3070] See it there in verse nine?
[time=3071] He says, likewise, I want women to adorn.
[time=3074] The word means to make oneself ready.
[time=3078] It means to get ready.
[time=3080] And here's the idea.
[time=3082] If you were going to a black tie affair, you would, ladies, you would get ready and you would get ready appropriately.
[time=3088] You would adorn yourself for a black tie affair.
[time=3091] If you're getting ready for bed, you would adorn yourself.
[time=3095] You would get ready to go to bed.
[time=3097] There's a way you would do that.
[time=3098] There's a look that comes with it.
[time=3100] He says, ladies, when you come to worship, there is a way to adorn yourself.
[time=3107] There is a way to get ready, to prepare yourself, to come to the gathering.
[time=3113] There's a way to dress and carry yourself in a way that attempts to bring no attention to you,
[time=3120] but instead desires to deflect all eyes and all attention to the God we've come to make much of.
[time=3128] How do you do this?
[time=3129] He says, well, do two things.
[time=3131] Adorn yourself modestly.
[time=3134] You with me?
[time=3135] Modestly.
[time=3136] This means to dress and conduct oneself in a way so as not to be the source of any temptation.
[time=3146] And I've got to stop there.
[time=3148] And I've just got to say this.
[time=3152] Our culture, this world of ours, and its message is teaching young women to dress in a way that
[time=3163] is tempting.
[time=3166] That's just the truth.
[time=3171] This culture and its message wants to teach women to dress in a way that draws attention
[time=3179] to their bodies and is alluring to those who would see that body.
[time=3186] And he uses a word here.
[time=3188] He says, dress modestly.
[time=3191] To dress and conduct oneself in a way so as not to be the source of any temptation.
[time=3199] Flies absolutely in the face of a fusion culture and 2011 culture.
[time=3206] It really does.
[time=3208] Word also rejects any notion of anything that is dishonorable to God.
[time=3215] Who does this?
[time=3217] And ladies, I'm not wagging my finger in your face.
[time=3220] This is not me trying to be insensitive.
[time=3224] I'm going to be as forthright with men as I will be with you.
[time=3229] Who does this?
[time=3230] Who would dress immodestly?
[time=3233] I just think it's important to think that through.
[time=3236] There's really two groups that come to mind.
[time=3238] There are those who I've seen it, I've seen it, I've experienced it.
[time=3243] Those who are so lonely, so insecure and so lonely and so wanting to be loved that they'll
[time=3256] do about anything to try and find life in the getting of attention.
[time=3262] It's just how it works.
[time=3267] And then, okay, that's one segment, and then there are those younger than them who just
[time=3273] kind of got trained by them.
[time=3277] And honestly, there are some, it's just all they know.
[time=3282] It's just normal.
[time=3283] It's just how they think they're supposed to dress.
[time=3288] And he says, no, no, especially in the body of Christ, which is to be this segment of
[time=3295] people who are other than the world we're supposed to in the way that we live and function and choose, we're supposed to be able to communicate, no, we don't think that way.
[time=3306] We have a source of security and love that runs deep.
[time=3311] And because of that, we're able to dress modestly and discreetly.
[time=3316] Look at that, we're discreetly showing self-control and integrity with respect to not allowing
[time=3323] sexual passions to be enticed through what one wears or what one doesn't.
[time=3329] And I'll close with this.
[time=3334] Not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments, specific practices that were causing distraction and discord in the church, women in the first century often
[time=3344] wove gold or pearls or other jewelry into their hairstyles, braided hair, to call attention
[time=3350] to themselves and their wealth or beauty.
[time=3355] The same was true of those women who wore costly garments by doing so they would draw attention to themselves and away from the Lord, likely causing the poorer women to be
[time=3365] envious.
[time=3367] Paul's point was to forbid the preoccupation of certain women with flaunting their wealth
[time=3374] or their beauty and distracting people from what they were there to do, worshiping the
[time=3380] Lord.
[time=3381] I've said it before, and we'll say it again, as a godly woman, as a woman who was wanting to honor God and his design for the assembly, don't show others your body, show them what
[time=3392] the text says, show them your heart.
[time=3394] Look at verse 10, but rather, adorn yourself rather by means of what good works.
[time=3402] Show us your kindness, ladies.
[time=3404] Show us your sensitivity to those in need.
[time=3408] Ladies, what's beautiful is you adorning yourself with service to others, worshipful
[time=3414] giving your prayers and your support.
[time=3417] Paul says draw attention to him, not your looks or what you can wear.
[time=3423] We'll come back to this next week, and we'll continue to talk about and look into God's Word as it relates to men and women and their roles in the church.
[time=3432] Would you stand and let me pray for us this morning as we go?
[time=3438] Father in heaven, we're grateful for the clear truth that your Word contains.
[time=3443] And God, as we do our best to teach it clearly, we know it raises questions that we trust
[time=3449] you, allow us to come back to God, we know it also makes us thankful for the design that
[time=3455] you've so clearly communicated.
[time=3457] May we as husbands and wives, may we as men and women in marriage and in the church.
[time=3463] Oh, God, may we embrace wholeheartedly and with great humility what you have ordained
[time=3469] and what you have set forth.
[time=3471] Father, thank you for the many, many, many Godly women in this church.
[time=3477] Thank you for the many Godly men who for years have been a model of the very things we talked
[time=3483] about this morning.
[time=3484] God, may we continue to grow in that Godliness in your son's name.
[time=3488] We pray.
[time=3489] [AMEN]
