[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - I wanted to just kind of focus our thoughts this morning around something that I think's just periodically good and healthy for us to come back to.
[time=40] I think it'll be good and healthy for you individually, like it has been for me to think these things through in recent days, also really good for us as a family, as a ministry to think this through.
[time=52] What are we here for?
[time=58] Sometimes maybe you ask yourself this.
[time=61] What is really, really?
[time=64] What is our purpose for being here?
[time=70] You say where, here, here in this room?
[time=71] Yeah, here in this life, yes.
[time=75] You and your life, me and my life.
[time=78] I wanna just stop you just for a moment and just invite you to consider for just a brief little window of time here.
[time=84] What is it, people?
[time=87] That you and I are really, when it's all said and done, that we're really to be about.
[time=94] I don't know about you, well, you know what I do know about you, I know your list is as long as mine, on the things that we can find ourselves doing and being about, but I wanna remind you today from God's word, what it says over and above all else, we are truly as believers, as followers of Jesus Christ, what our purpose is, what it should be, each and every day, Matthew, 28, Jesus is about to leave.
[time=121] The 12 have now become 11 and he's about ready to take off, literally, as they say, and he turns to them and the last thing he says to them, those who he loved so much who he knew were going to be responsible for the kingdom moving forward, he said, go.
[time=140] He said, go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, go on to verse 20, it says there in that next verse, teaching them, having made them, with the help of God, obviously, having made them disciples, having seen people come to faith, he says, what I want you to do next is teach them, teach them everything, he says, teach them to observe all that I commanded you, and lo, I am with you always in that process, I'll never leave you, even to the end of the age, and then I just want you to just simply read what's there on the screen.
[time=181] Two things, we've been left here, empowered and commanded to do two things, and I hope you saw it as we read, lead people toward faith in Christ.
[time=192] Please look at that, you and I are to be engaged in the process of humbly, lovingly, faithfully, leading people toward faith in Christ.
[time=202] Having done that, we are to teach people God's word, all that he has commanded.
[time=209] I want to just take a few minutes this morning, let's just start with that first one, and as you think about people coming to faith in Christ, many of you may have already come to faith in Christ, but I know, I know there are those in the room this morning and you haven't yet.
[time=226] You're in the midst of that discussion, if you will, you're thinking things through, you've been thinking things through for a few months, some of you for longer than that.
[time=236] And I want to remind you this morning because I think it's important, because I think it's one of the things he's left us here to do, and we should prioritize it, and so I want to prioritize it right here.
[time=246] I want to remind you this morning, church, of what it says in Romans 3, 23, the beginning here kind of of the great gospel message that all have sinned, we've never met anybody who's ever argued that point with me.
[time=260] Thousands of people over the years have argued many points with me.
[time=264] Nobody has ever argued that point, all have sinned, it says.
[time=268] And in that sin, they fall short of the glory of God.
[time=273] There's some bad news connected to that.
[time=276] Romans 6, 23, just a few chapters later says that the wages of that sin, your sin in mind, anything whereby we have fallen short of what God has prescribed and commanded, it says the wages, what you get, what you earn, the wages of sin is death, physical death and spiritual death forever.
[time=297] Bad news, but, and here comes the great good news
[time=303] of the gospel, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[time=311] Oh, look at what it says in Romans 10.
[time=314] I love how just a few chapters later he says that if you confess with your mouth, Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead.
[time=325] If with your mouth and with your heart, you believe the truth of the gospel that you were separated from God because of your sin, that God in his great love and desire to bridge that gap of separation since his son, Jesus Christ.
[time=341] So you can be forgiven and have life now and eternal when you believe this, when you believe it, says you will be saved.
[time=353] And what a great, great truth.
[time=355] For many of you this morning, you've experienced that for others of you, my hope and my prayer, our hope and prayer is that you would and that in experiencing that, you would come to the realization that we serve a God who rescues.
[time=371] So we serve a God who in his great love and in his great desire to see lives changed and redeemed came down and made right.
[time=382] What was so very wrong.
[time=384] I hope this is just, again, a few minutes of reminder to you.
[time=389] I hope those of you who have experienced that rescue can bask in the joy of your salvation today.
[time=397] For those of you who haven't, I hope and I pray that it would be just another opportunity for you to bow the knee of your heart to the one who comes to love and redeem and rescue.
[time=409] Would you stand, church, and let's sing about this great gospel truth together.
[time=414] (upbeat music)
[time=422] [MUSIC - 231 seconds]
[time=660] You can be seated. I love the line in that song.
[time=670] Maybe as you sang it, there's a line that popped out to you.
[time=674] Maybe you've got a favorite phrase in there.
[time=676] I love the phrase early on in the song where it talks about how his love went, went where, went further still.
[time=689] Now, so many times that I'll sit and talk with people, young and old, and they'll say, Kelly, you have no idea
[time=701] where I've been. You have no idea what I've done.
[time=705] They'll look at me, and they believe it.
[time=707] They believe that somehow they're sinned.
[time=710] They believe somehow their iniquity and rebellion has led them to this place that somehow is unreachable.
[time=718] And what a privilege it is for me, and I know from any of you to be able to share with them, that his love goes, what, further still,
[time=730] for God?
[time=733] It's John 3, 16, say, "For God loved the world." No, it says, "For God what?" So loved the world.
[time=741] That his love went further still.
[time=743] Well, hey, having come to faith, then there is this great opportunity.
[time=749] And beyond opportunity, Church, it's a command of God that we would grow.
[time=755] And God commands those of us who lead you spiritually to do everything we can within our power, with his help to grow you.
[time=762] God commands you as those who are now following after his son to be a people who make it a huge priority in your life,
[time=772] to be growing.
[time=773] You've heard me say it in the last year or so.
[time=776] You'll probably hear me now say it for years and years.
[time=779] You know how I get stuck on things.
[time=782] But it's really true.
[time=783] We've tried to encourage you with this.
[time=785] We've tried to help you see this if you are not growing as a living organism, whether it's a plant or a child or a spiritual being.
[time=796] If you're not growing, you're what?
[time=800] You're dying.
[time=802] You don't grow?
[time=804] It doesn't go well.
[time=806] And he said that we are to teach you all that he commanded you.
[time=811] All that he commanded us to do, we are to teach you, we are to equip you, we are to make that something that you can see and understand and interact with.
[time=820] And so really this morning, I want to just encourage you.
[time=823] I could go in so many directions here, but I want to just say this to you.
[time=827] I think one thing I've seen over 25 years of ministry.
[time=832] One thing I've seen in the local churches that I've served in, in this church, for almost 16 years.
[time=839] One thing I've seen as I've traveled across the country and across the world, and had the privilege of watching and meeting and engaging with other Christ followers all over this globe, many of whom live in much more difficult circumstances than you and I ever will.
[time=858] One thing I have learned to associate with growing.
[time=862] Stay with me here.
[time=864] One thing that I think is really synonymous with spiritual growth is the idea of sacrifice.
[time=872] People who are growing are willing to let go.
[time=877] People who are growing are willing to suffer mistreatment.
[time=882] People who are growing are willing to be misunderstood.
[time=886] People who are growing spiritually are willing to just simply lay their lives down and allow God to take them, allow God to do with them, allow God to show them whatever He may want to do.
[time=903] And I want to encourage you this morning.
[time=905] I want to encourage you to be a person.
[time=910] As you head back to school, or you've already gotten back to school, I want to encourage you to be a young boy or a girl who's willing to sacrifice yourself for the great cause of Christ.
[time=922] I want your love for God to be such that you would never allow anything to come in between you and your devotion to Him.
[time=929] I want you mothers and fathers.
[time=931] I want you students, teenagers, you senior adults.
[time=934] I want those of you in the room who name the name of Christ.
[time=939] I want there to be a sense in you where as you grow you're understanding the great opportunity you have to let go of your life.
[time=949] When we make much of Him, remember, when we glorify Him, we allow ourselves to assume this position of service.
[time=957] We follow humbly.
[time=961] And we're going to sing a song here in just a moment.
[time=965] And as you sing it and as you proclaim its truth, I want you to understand the deep and very real connection this song has to the growing that is or isn't going on in your life.
[time=979] And oh, may this be this song and its message be the posture of your life.
[time=985] As you work, as you go to school, as you lead your family, as you give yourself in whatever arena God has you, may this song describe the kind of growth that has occurred in you, the kind of living that you're willing to live.
[time=1002] May He have all, all of you, all of me.
[time=1008] Let's stand, would you?
[time=1010] And let's with hearts of worship and devotion sing this great song to Him.
[time=1025] Take my life and let it be, consecrated Lord to thee.
[time=1036] Take my moments and my days.
[time=1041] Let them flow in ceaseless praise.
[time=1047] Take my hands and let them move.
[time=1052] Add the impulse of thy love.
[time=1058] Take my feet and let them be.
[time=1063] Swift and beautiful for thee.
[time=1069] Take my voice and let me sing.
[time=1078] Always, only for my King.
[time=1084] Take my lips and let them be.
[time=1089] Filled with messages from thee.
[time=1095] Take my silver and my gold.
[time=1100] Not a might would I withhold.
[time=1106] Take my intellect and use every power as you choose.
[time=1119] Here am I.
[time=1124] Oh, let me.
[time=1130] Take my life.
[time=1135] It's all for thee.
[time=1143] Take my will and make it thine.
[time=1148] It shall be no longer mine.
[time=1154] Take my heart, it is thy know.
[time=1159] It shall be thy road of Rome.
[time=1165] Take my love, my Lord, I'm born.
[time=1170] And your feet is treasured.
[time=1176] Take myself and I will be ever only all for thee.
[time=1198] Here am I.
[time=1205] Oh, let me.
[time=1210] Take my life.
[time=1216] It's all for thee.
[time=1222] Here am I.
[time=1227] Oh, let me.
[time=1232] Take my life.
[time=1237] It's all for thee.
[time=1242] Here am I.
[time=1248] Oh, let me.
[time=1253] Take my life.
[time=1259] It's all for thee.
[time=1264] Here am I.
[time=1270] Oh, let me.
[time=1275] Take my life.
[time=1283] It's all for thee.
[time=1294] Take my life.
[time=1311] Take myself and I will be ever only all for thee.
[time=1323] Take my life.
[time=1328] It's been a crazy week for me the last couple of weeks, actually.
[time=1332] Sunday night we left late to take our buddy, our little buddy,
[time=1338] J.E. to who was middle school guy.
[time=1342] And now he's out.
[time=1343] We took him to Durham, North Carolina, where he's at Duke University, attending seminary.
[time=1348] And we're super excited for him, but at the same time, there were tears because we know we're going to miss him.
[time=1354] And we love him.
[time=1355] And so that was fun with sucky pops along the way.
[time=1358] Big time road trip.
[time=1359] About seven, eight of us guys packed in the van and took him out there.
[time=1363] And it was a good time.
[time=1364] We had 2-12 Wednesday when I got back.
[time=1366] And then the last couple of days we've been at the summit, the Willow Creek Leadership Summit.
[time=1371] And we were challenged and encouraged and just by these wonderful leaders around the world who are doing really cool things for God.
[time=1378] They're just trusting God.
[time=1379] They're digging ditches and things like that.
[time=1381] And it was really, really good.
[time=1383] And so it's an honor to be up here.
[time=1385] KB asked me to speak.
[time=1387] And I said, "Absolutely.
[time=1389] Sure.
[time=1390] You're my boss.
[time=1391] I'm not going to tell you no." [laughter] And so, and it's really nice to know that after a month off of sleeping in and playing some golf, laying on the beach that he came back, reached a Sunday, and then he needed another Sunday off.
[time=1406] [laughter] So I'm happy to fill in for you.
[time=1410] I'm sure it was overwhelming last week.
[time=1413] So I'm glad you're back.
[time=1416] [laughter] No, but it's seriously.
[time=1420] It's refreshing to know that we have in our culture of go, go, go, that our leadership team, our elders, were gracious enough and cared enough about our senior leader to allow him to take that time off to refuel his jets and to reflect and just be with his family.
[time=1438] Because that's the most important ministry he has is his family.
[time=1441] And so we're just saying, "Yeah, thank you.
[time=1443] It's really good."
[time=1445] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1448] And I'm thankful for his example that he did that.
[time=1451] It showed me how much he cared about his family.
[time=1453] That's an example I can follow and will follow.
[time=1457] And it shows their kindness.
[time=1459] And so out of that kindness, it's really great.
[time=1461] This is my last Sunday.
[time=1463] I will be back around Christmas time, elders.
[time=1465] [laughter] So thank you.
[time=1468] Thank you so much for that.
[time=1471] [laughter] Yep.
[time=1474] When I think of the Psalms, I think it's probably one of the books in the scriptures that gets plucked the most.
[time=1480] It's probably one of the most popular books of the Bible that we put on coffee mugs and t-shirts and bumper stickers and calendars.
[time=1490] And so I brought a few examples of just some things that might happen.
[time=1494] Teach me to do your will.
[time=1496] It's really pretty.
[time=1497] The guy's walking on the beach there.
[time=1499] It's kind of cute, you know.
[time=1500] There's another one.
[time=1501] The next one.
[time=1502] It's got this field.
[time=1503] So I'm 139.
[time=1504] It's really, you see these all over and calendars.
[time=1506] You see them on funeral home walls and things like that.
[time=1509] And then the next one, look at that guy.
[time=1512] You know, let everything in his breath.
[time=1514] Praise the Lord.
[time=1515] So you got that one.
[time=1517] It's good.
[time=1519] So, but what's funny is sometimes, yeah, okay.
[time=1521] So I brought, I'm kind of made my own and I'm going to market these.
[time=1524] So there's Igor or what ever his name is.
[time=1527] And it says, "The ropes of death tightened around me.
[time=1529] The snares of shield confronted me.
[time=1531] I was confronted with trouble and sorrow." I mean, the scriptures, you got to balance it, right?
[time=1535] You can't just do the happy stuff, right?
[time=1537] I think that's kind of the thing.
[time=1538] We get the next one with those cute puppies.
[time=1541] He sent his anger in full force.
[time=1544] He did not spare them from death.
[time=1546] He handed their lives over to destruction.
[time=1548] It's good.
[time=1550] And then the last one, look at that baby.
[time=1553] Hey, but even then we'll die.
[time=1555] The Lord's enemies will be incinerated.
[time=1558] They'll go up and smoke.
[time=1560] Anyway, that's just, if you want to sum of those, I'm going to market those.
[time=1564] So, Craig Kirk talked to me about doing that.
[time=1567] So we're going to market those.
[time=1569] But really, the Psalms act as a terrific window into the past.
[time=1575] And we can hear and we can feel and we can capture how our brothers and sisters in the past related with God and how he related with them and the words that he spoke and the things that they said to him.
[time=1589] It's a cool, just picture into how that relationship was about.
[time=1594] And occasionally at 2.12 and at retreats, we'll lay out a journal for students and they can come up and they just write stuff.
[time=1600] And one of my favorite things to do is to read those little, they're not Psalms, they're not poetic, they're just raw.
[time=1606] And I love it because it can just read that thing I can hear what that student's struggling with or what that student's excited about or the sin, there's this confession in there.
[time=1615] And it's just a really window into the heart of our brothers and sisters in Christ almost 2,500 years ago.
[time=1621] The Psalms witness to the glory of God.
[time=1624] They reveal the significance of the Vedic Covenant.
[time=1627] They allow us to hear and feel as KB talked to us last week.
[time=1631] Emotions as it relates to the faithfulness of God.
[time=1634] It's a songbook of Israel.
[time=1636] It's a window into their faith and it's God's words to his people.
[time=1640] The Psalms open a window into what God is, how great and magnificent wise and utterly awe-inspiring he truly is.
[time=1651] So I'm going to read Psalm 24 in its entirety and you don't need to stand because if your heart isn't ready, if your heart doesn't have reverence for the words of the scriptures then it doesn't matter if you're standing or sitting.
[time=1666] So I'm going to ask you to get your heart ready and I'm just going to read it.
[time=1672] The earth is the Lord's and everything in it.
[time=1675] The world and all who live in it for he founded it on the seas and established it on the waters.
[time=1682] Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord?
[time=1684] Who may stand in his holy place, the one who has clean hands and a pure heart who does not trust in an idol or swear by false God?
[time=1692] They were received blessing from the Lord and vindication from God their Savior.
[time=1697] Such is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek your face.
[time=1701] Oh God of Jacob.
[time=1703] Lift up your heads you gates, be lifted up you ancient doors that the King of glory may come in.
[time=1709] Who is the King of glory the Lord's strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle?
[time=1714] Lift up your heads you gates, lift them up you ancient doors that the King of glory may come in.
[time=1720] Who is he, this King of glory, the Lord almighty?
[time=1724] He is the King of glory.
[time=1727] Now if you're following along in your notes children's ministry people if you have that half sheet I don't even know if they got in there but the first blank is the great King.
[time=1736] That's your first blank the great King and there's no other blanks because blanks drive me crazy.
[time=1741] KB and Webby kind of had a little thing about how KB never has a sheet and Webby always does and KB's like well I'd have a half sheet too if I had eight weeks to prepare for a message and you know kind of poking fun at each other is really good.
[time=1754] Staff media is awesome.
[time=1755] And so I don't like the blanks I don't fill them in because usually we just stick them in our Bible or throw them away anyways.
[time=1760] So I like it if you want to draw students you have a little box.
[time=1765] You can draw what do you think a great King would look like?
[time=1768] You can draw that out in adults you can too.
[time=1770] I know KB for the first two years that we interacted with each other.
[time=1776] He'd start to talk or I'd just staff meetings and I'm in my little book and I'm drawing stuff.
[time=1780] He thinks I'm just bored and blowing him off.
[time=1783] When actually it's a higher brain activity for people who doodle.
[time=1787] It's true it's proven fact.
[time=1789] So you know they didn't they didn't have recognized that yet and so that's what's going on there.
[time=1794] So the great King draw away and kids if you turn them in maybe we'll give you a prize for the best one.
[time=1800] Janice we'll make that happen.
[time=1802] Okay.
[time=1803] We probably have a candy bar or something.
[time=1805] Okay.
[time=1806] The earth is the Lord's and everything in it.
[time=1808] There's a couple other scriptures I just wanted to share real fast that kind of proclaim this that it's found all throughout the scriptures.
[time=1815] In Deuteronomy 10 to the Lord your God along the heavens.
[time=1818] Even the highest heavens the earth and everything in it.
[time=1821] Psalm 50 says this for every animal of the forest is mine and the cattle on a thousand hills.
[time=1828] Psalm 50 12 a few verses later the world is mine all that is in it.
[time=1834] And 1 Chronicles says this for everything in heaven and earth is yours.
[time=1838] Yours oh Lord is the kingdom.
[time=1840] You're exalted as head over all.
[time=1844] And there's a few examples of people in the Old Testament and in the New Testament who forgot this truth.
[time=1851] That everything is God's.
[time=1855] All things are God's.
[time=1857] One of the best examples is one of the most powerful kings in history.
[time=1860] King Nebuchadnezzar and he learned his lesson the hard way.
[time=1863] One day he was for a walk as he strolled.
[time=1866] He said this is not this the great Babylon that I have built as a royal residence
[time=1873] by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty.
[time=1878] Nebuchadnezzar says this and God's answer is quick and to the point he took the king's sanity away and drove him outside to eat grass like a cow.
[time=1889] Not for a day not for a month but for seven years.
[time=1898] And then God restored Nebuchadnezzar's sanity to the king no longer exalted in his possessions
[time=1904] but glorified God as sovereign overall.
[time=1908] See when we forget that God owns it all bad things can happen.
[time=1916] The New Testament affirms this.
[time=1919] The Son is the image of the invisible God the firstborn over all creation.
[time=1924] For in him all things were created things in heaven and on earth visible and invisible or their thrones or powers or rulers or authorities.
[time=1932] All things have been created through him and for him.
[time=1936] He is before all things and in him all things hold together.
[time=1941] And he is the head of the body the church.
[time=1943] He is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead so that in everything he might have the supremacy.
[time=1951] All things are gods and it seems to be pretty easy to remember this when it's a big thing.
[time=1957] When it seems to be a decision or an action or something that's going on in our lives it just seems way bigger than us.
[time=1964] But what about those really small things that we probably don't even notice are happening?
[time=1970] Where were you sitting? Just sit real still.
[time=1973] And I want you to consciously feel yourself breathe in and out.
[time=1979] In.
[time=1982] Feel that breath.
[time=1985] Sometimes when you think about breathing it messes you up.
[time=1988] You ever do that at night or you see like oh am I going to breathe again?
[time=1992] Is it back?
[time=1993] Okay it's back on track.
[time=1994] Okay good.
[time=1995] You know what I'm talking about?
[time=1996] Okay it doesn't matter.
[time=1997] Anyway I do that.
[time=1999] And per day you take over 28,000 breaths.
[time=2005] 28,000 every single one of those is the Lord's.
[time=2010] We don't even know what's happening.
[time=2013] 28,000.
[time=2014] Now put your hand in your heart or in your wrist.
[time=2017] In your neck however you want to feel your heartbeat.
[time=2019] Remember that works for you.
[time=2021] Just feel that.
[time=2027] You feel it?
[time=2028] I hope you have one.
[time=2032] It's over a hundred thousand beats a day.
[time=2036] It's going on every day.
[time=2038] God owns every single one of those beats.
[time=2043] And we don't even know it.
[time=2045] We don't even know it's happening.
[time=2048] Everything is the Lord's.
[time=2051] These activities are happening.
[time=2053] We don't know it.
[time=2054] The earth is the Lord's and everything in it.
[time=2056] The world and all who live in it.
[time=2059] And now if we believe that.
[time=2062] We come to this little section in Romans chapter 9.
[time=2067] And the question starts Paul says what if God?
[time=2073] Let me finish it.
[time=2074] What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath?
[time=2084] What if God decides to use somebody for his wrath to show his glory?
[time=2091] AKA Pharaoh?
[time=2093] What if God decided to do that?
[time=2095] We say no.
[time=2096] That's God can't do that.
[time=2098] That's not loving.
[time=2099] That's not just.
[time=2100] Hold on.
[time=2101] God invented love, God is the only just one and the planet in the universe.
[time=2107] He owns it all.
[time=2108] He can do that if he wants to.
[time=2113] What if God?
[time=2116] He owns it all.
[time=2118] And we can complain.
[time=2120] And I understand when there's pain when things don't make sense.
[time=2123] But at the end of the day we have to say God owns it all.
[time=2128] I have to believe that.
[time=2131] Everything is God's.
[time=2132] He can do what God does.
[time=2134] He can do anything he wants according to his character.
[time=2139] There is always a purpose, always a reason.
[time=2141] But at the end of the day we have to say he is God.
[time=2145] I am not.
[time=2146] I have nothing he has all.
[time=2149] You guys say that with me?
[time=2150] He is God.
[time=2153] I am not.
[time=2155] He has everything.
[time=2158] He has it all.
[time=2160] Let's try that again.
[time=2161] I messed it up.
[time=2162] He is God.
[time=2164] I am not.
[time=2165] I have nothing.
[time=2168] He has all.
[time=2170] So ask yourself a few questions.
[time=2173] If we look into our hearts and there's probably several things I could have pulled out here.
[time=2178] But I thought of money, time, and children.
[time=2183] Those things are pretty valuable to us.
[time=2186] Those are the things I would say that are probably right here with us.
[time=2190] We kind of hang on to those pretty tightly.
[time=2192] So with our money, it's all God's.
[time=2195] How we spend it, what we do with it, is there ever a point in time when you have money?
[time=2200] No, it's God's.
[time=2201] He's called you to steward.
[time=2202] He's called you to take care of it.
[time=2205] It's his.
[time=2207] And oftentimes, we've got our faith in this thing called the stock market, which I don't
[time=2213] understand at all.
[time=2215] There's money somewhere, but it's not real money.
[time=2219] It's just like, you know, it's like nobody really has that money in the bank.
[time=2223] It's just there.
[time=2224] It makes no sense at all.
[time=2226] I don't want to know about it.
[time=2228] I don't care, but it's going to go up and down.
[time=2230] It fluctuates.
[time=2231] God has it all.
[time=2232] And when we put our security in, I've got this much in the bank.
[time=2236] You don't have anything in the bank.
[time=2238] It's God's money.
[time=2239] He can take it away tomorrow.
[time=2244] Maybe that's a good actually.
[time=2246] If God zeroed my accounts out tomorrow with my faith last the next day, it's a good question.
[time=2257] Time.
[time=2258] If we think about our time and got to have me time and we have time and if you have a piece
[time=2264] of paper, draw a straight line, a horizon line on your paper.
[time=2268] And on that line, I want you to put a little dot.
[time=2270] If you take notes, if you're not just in your head, awesome.
[time=2273] Okay?
[time=2274] And that dot represents your lifetime on the scope of eternity.
[time=2279] It's not very long.
[time=2282] Eternity is very long.
[time=2284] And you've got to ask yourself a question.
[time=2286] Am I living for the dot?
[time=2289] Or am I living for eternity?
[time=2291] Am I investing in?
[time=2293] Am I doing the things that will last God's word, souls of men and prayer?
[time=2300] Am I doing anything with those three things?
[time=2303] Or is it all about the dot?
[time=2306] So are you saying you can't go to movies?
[time=2308] No, go to movies.
[time=2309] I love movies.
[time=2310] But make sure you're also investing in putting your time into eternal things.
[time=2319] I love my children.
[time=2321] This one is hard for me and KB and I were talking as we were singing.
[time=2324] And this one never is never ending.
[time=2327] This one seems to go on because with our kids, see, we want what's best.
[time=2332] We want them to have a good life.
[time=2334] We want them to succeed, whatever that looks like.
[time=2337] And for many of us, it looks like this.
[time=2339] Straight A's, great at sports, solid education, scholarship, chaching.
[time=2347] Right?
[time=2349] Which equals a happy mom or dad, which means they can go to college and get a good job and be secure.
[time=2355] That's good.
[time=2356] There's nothing wrong with that.
[time=2358] But what if God, Romus I, what if God, what if God wants to take the gospel to a part of the world
[time=2370] through the suffering of your son or your daughter?
[time=2381] That doesn't sound very fun.
[time=2383] What if God?
[time=2384] Are we going to hold on?
[time=2386] Are we going to fight that?
[time=2387] Are we going to say God?
[time=2389] You own it all.
[time=2392] Even my kids.
[time=2395] I don't want a single pain or suffering or dirty, stinking boy to come near my daughters.
[time=2407] But I have to do this, and it never ends, whether they're 9, 10, or 30.
[time=2414] I have to hold my kids like this.
[time=2418] That's really hard.
[time=2419] I confess.
[time=2420] That's really, really hard.
[time=2423] Number two, the next section of the scripture, the hill of the Lord.
[time=2427] If you fill in the blanks, the hill of the Lord.
[time=2430] Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord?
[time=2432] Who may stand in His holy place?
[time=2435] The one who has clean hands and a pure heart who does not trust in an idol or swear by a false God.
[time=2443] The mountain and the holy place, that's God's presence.
[time=2448] See, when there's the presence of God, there needs to be the preparation to be with God.
[time=2454] See, this idea of the one who has clean hands and a pure heart, right?
[time=2458] There's this idea of preparation.
[time=2460] How many of you have been on a first date ever in your lifetime?
[time=2465] Okay.
[time=2466] Some of you, maybe you're on a date today.
[time=2468] Welcome.
[time=2469] Good job.
[time=2470] Guy.
[time=2471] Dude, let's talk afterwards about a better idea.
[time=2474] Okay.
[time=2475] Not sure you have to be married.
[time=2478] Single is awesome.
[time=2479] God loves you too.
[time=2480] God loves us all.
[time=2481] Okay.
[time=2482] So, just want to alienate anybody.
[time=2483] Okay.
[time=2484] Good.
[time=2485] No emails.
[time=2487] Okay.
[time=2488] So, you've been on a first date, right?
[time=2489] So, the guy, let's see, you're going to get her at seven.
[time=2491] Seven o'clock.
[time=2492] Six forty-five.
[time=2493] Jump in the shower.
[time=2494] Wait.
[time=2495] No, I'm good.
[time=2496] I don't need a shower, right?
[time=2497] Maybe I'm doing a new shirt.
[time=2498] Okay.
[time=2499] New shirt.
[time=2500] You go together.
[time=2501] Now, the girl, this is just true.
[time=2502] You've been getting ready for a while, a couple hours.
[time=2504] Maybe you've been picking your outfit.
[time=2506] Mmm.
[time=2507] No.
[time=2508] Okay.
[time=2509] Yes.
[time=2510] And then, you know, you get cleaned up doing your hair and then you do the pfft.
[time=2513] Right?
[time=2514] The little...
[time=2517] You know it's true.
[time=2521] Right?
[time=2522] Get all the smell going.
[time=2524] Right?
[time=2525] There's preparation because you're excited.
[time=2527] Now, the guy's getting ready.
[time=2528] Here's fifteen minutes.
[time=2529] He's getting ready to pick up the girl.
[time=2531] Because he wants to look good for her.
[time=2534] Now, the lady's getting ready because she wants to look good for any other woman that they might come across during the date.
[time=2542] It's true and you know it.
[time=2545] Different between guys and girls.
[time=2549] Okay.
[time=2550] So, there's this idea of preparation that goes into it.
[time=2553] Many of us drove to church today.
[time=2554] We got our coffee.
[time=2555] Right?
[time=2556] We took our showers and sat down on our pews.
[time=2559] Maybe we can sing some songs and we still have not acknowledged the presence of God in our life.
[time=2567] We're sitting in the pew.
[time=2570] We're singing about him.
[time=2572] We're looking at all these other people who are singing about him.
[time=2575] But we have not mentally, consciously said, "God is right here."
[time=2582] The presence of Yahweh is right here.
[time=2586] The appearance of holiness is not enough.
[time=2591] The one who has clean hands and a pure heart.
[time=2593] What does that look like?
[time=2594] Who can be in the presence of God?
[time=2596] The one who is honest and transparent and real and owns his mistakes, confesses and strives to rise above.
[time=2604] The person who trusts in Christ and not their own efforts or by hiding, which is living a fake life.
[time=2611] See, it's funny how we can turn doing the right thing into an idol.
[time=2621] How we can turn going to church, check the box into an idol.
[time=2627] Things become, somehow it becomes detached from an honest and sincere internal love for God.
[time=2634] And it becomes about just doing the right thing, going through the motion.
[time=2638] Instead, it becomes about appearance.
[time=2640] It's a show.
[time=2641] It's a role we are trusting in an idol.
[time=2644] And that idol is us.
[time=2645] We have become the false.
[time=2647] God, you see, when we care more about what others think than what God thinks, we have become self-protectionists.
[time=2655] We have become the God of self.
[time=2660] And that's not a pure heart or clean hands.
[time=2663] We're trusting in false things.
[time=2666] And when we live out that false stuff, man, we do this because we fear.
[time=2673] We fear what others think of us.
[time=2676] We fear what others think of us instead of what God thinks of us.
[time=2681] We have a friend, and for this whole year, actually, we've been talking.
[time=2685] And this person is just going through some church, just getting rid of some junk.
[time=2694] And one of the things that this person is dealing with is they feel guilty often.
[time=2700] They feel they're never good enough.
[time=2704] You know why?
[time=2705] Because when they look around at church, they see all these people, and this is what they say.
[time=2710] Who have it all together.
[time=2714] Nobody's got it all together.
[time=2719] Come on.
[time=2721] But when we act like we do, and we put on this face and walk around, how are you doing?
[time=2726] I'm super spiritual, right?
[time=2728] We have influenced, we have affected them to make them feel like they're never going to be good enough.
[time=2733] That's no good.
[time=2735] See, when we're honest and when we're sincere and when we trust that God cares more about
[time=2741] us than other people, man.
[time=2743] So you know what I tell?
[time=2745] I say, "Hey, you're a Christian.
[time=2749] You're on the team.
[time=2751] You've got nothing to worry about.
[time=2754] You've made varsity.
[time=2755] Tryouts are over.
[time=2757] You've made the cut.
[time=2759] Now it's time to play ball.
[time=2761] It's time to live out what's true of you.
[time=2764] Varsity, you're on the team.
[time=2767] You can't get cut.
[time=2770] You might be get benched, but you can't get cut.
[time=2774] Don't look or listen to the bleachers.
[time=2778] Look and only listen to the audience of one which is Jesus Christ.
[time=2784] Live it out.
[time=2785] There's no guilt.
[time=2787] You're good enough.
[time=2788] Jesus has made you good enough.
[time=2790] It's done.
[time=2791] Get at the cross through the blood, shed on the cross.
[time=2794] That's the good news.
[time=2795] You have been reconciled to God by being crucified with Christ.
[time=2799] You're a Christian.
[time=2801] You're a believer.
[time=2802] Your identity is in Christ.
[time=2805] Guilt is gone.
[time=2806] Life has come.
[time=2807] Live out what's true of you.
[time=2808] No more false stuff.
[time=2809] No more idols.
[time=2810] Live for God.
[time=2812] That's a pure heart and that's pure hands.
[time=2816] And so often we come to church.
[time=2818] I don't want anybody to know that I sinned.
[time=2820] We already know.
[time=2821] I mean, God already told us, check it out and we know.
[time=2827] Parents.
[time=2828] I said this last service.
[time=2830] Parents.
[time=2831] One of the best things you can do with your students is to become middle school high school -ish, right?
[time=2837] And you can adjust that depending on the maturity of your son or your daughter.
[time=2844] Just let them hear of your past failures, mistakes and your current struggles.
[time=2852] Let them see that in you.
[time=2855] Total openness, wrong solution, Larry Crabb.
[time=2856] I'm not saying just puke it out, tell them every bad thing, every detail you've ever done because that might be a little scary.
[time=2864] But let them see, let them hear that life still continues after struggles, after failures.
[time=2873] Let them know that.
[time=2875] Let them know that mom and dad love Jesus and fail sometimes and it's going to be okay.
[time=2882] Because when they do, they can feel normal and they can differentiate fake faith with authentic
[time=2889] faith because you know what?
[time=2891] They already know you struggle.
[time=2895] They see it.
[time=2898] They know.
[time=2899] But when you're honest about it, when you say, "Yep, dad blew it," man, that says, "Okay,
[time=2907] this faith in Jesus is not hopeless.
[time=2909] I can live it out and if I make a mistake, I can keep going." Mom and dad, that's free.
[time=2915] Take that and leave it and I hope you will take it.
[time=2919] Who can be in the presence of God, that preparation we're talking about, that preparation looks like this.
[time=2924] Mom who is honest and transparent and real and owns his mistakes or her mistakes confesses,
[time=2931] strives to rise above, trusts in Christ and not their own efforts.
[time=2937] When we prepare, we understand we are in the presence of the Holy God, moment by moment
[time=2944] every single day.
[time=2946] It's beautiful.
[time=2948] And when we do those things, verse 5 and 6, they will receive blessing from the Lord and
[time=2955] vindication from God, their Savior, such is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek your face.
[time=2961] This is so freeing to think about.
[time=2965] But when we do that, when we prepare, but see, a lot of times we don't prepare and that's why most people don't like to come to church because when they come in through those doors, there's been no preparation for a day or weeks, months, maybe even years.
[time=2979] So when they come into church, they feel dirty and they feel like nobody likes them and they feel guilty because they haven't prepared.
[time=2986] And so these words that are being spoken, the songs that are being sang and the things
[time=2992] that are happening in this service, there's a wall around you.
[time=2995] You cannot be blessed by the presence of God because there has been no preparation for God.
[time=3005] We do a series with the students every year, signed dating, it's me, sex, relationships,
[time=3014] all of everything.
[time=3014] We tell it straight.
[time=3016] And every year we talk about the context that that stuff's supposed to happen in, the beauty
[time=3022] of it, that it's holy, that it's awesome, that it's really good, and there's a certain covenant and context that that is supposed to take place in, right?
[time=3031] And every year when we get to that kind of a message, students heads are down and they
[time=3038] shrink in their chair a little bit, they kind of hide.
[time=3043] Maybe sometimes they'll even come up afterwards before a word can come out of their mouth.
[time=3049] I messed up this weekend with my boyfriend.
[time=3052] Right?
[time=3053] There's been no preparation, so that message wasn't a blessing, that message just felt
[time=3059] like, oh my gosh, right?
[time=3065] Some of you came to church and you're dirty, we're glad you're here.
[time=3070] That's why we're here, as Kaby was talking about, there is a Savior named Jesus who can
[time=3077] cleanse you, who can make you good enough, forever, who can get you on varsity, right?
[time=3086] Maybe you haven't prepared, maybe your heart's been dirty for a week or a month, maybe there's just something you was struggling with, but it's all in hiding, you've never talked about it with God.
[time=3097] Maybe there's some bitterness, resentment in your heart, maybe on the way here you had
[time=3104] an argument with your kids, or you blasted your wife with some cutting words, and so
[time=3110] as you're sitting here, these words are not really a blessing because that is in the way.
[time=3116] The cool part, it's not too late, it's never too late with God, and we can do that right now.
[time=3121] So you can't expect revival in your own heart without repentance.
[time=3126] So right where you're sitting, lean to your neighbor, right on the piece of paper, something that's getting in the way that you haven't prepared yet, go ahead and do that right now.
[time=3134] This is what church is for, when we come, we don't have to pretend we're okay because
[time=3140] we love each other, right?
[time=3145] Write something down, maybe lean to your neighbor and say, "This is something I've been struggling with and it's been there," or "I've got this in my life and I need God to get rid of it," whatever it might be, go ahead and do that right now.
[time=3163] Prepare to ascend the mountain of the Lord.
[time=3169] Prepare to be in the presence of the holy Yahweh.
[time=3176] And verse 6, "As is to such is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek your face,
[time=3182] that seeking your face God," seeking, that's kind of this idea of this relationship, that intimacy with God when you've prepared, when you moment by moment daily, you've confessed and you say, "God, I don't want sin.
[time=3194] I want you," right, and there's this eye-to-eye contact that's going on, and you're in this relationship with God and we've been preparing every single day, the sad part of that seeking
[time=3205] God's face, but some of us are sitting here and we're hiding on the side of God, hoping He doesn't notice us.
[time=3215] We're over here, God wants us here, that's why Jesus died, so we could be here.
[time=3221] When we're hiding, seek His face, there will be blessing from the Lord, and vindication
[time=3227] from God, our Savior.
[time=3231] Number three, if you're filling in the blank and drawing pictures, the divine warrior, the
[time=3237] divine warrior, see this passage is probably a hymn, maybe a celebration type of thing
[time=3243] they would recite, and it has to do with David and his army or his procession arriving
[time=3250] at Jerusalem with the ark of the covenant, and this was a big deal because that's where
[time=3256] God's presence was, that's where we talk about the hill and God's presence being there and preparing, right?
[time=3263] And so if you can imagine that, there's this procession, I don't know how many, I like to think thousands, but it might not have been thousands, I don't know, but just there's this army of these people, they're outside the gate, right, and they've got the ark,
[time=3277] covenant, they've got God's presence in this box, the one that won them victories and gave
[time=3284] them favor, that's where God is.
[time=3288] And so if you can imagine there's these, these procession is outside and they say lift up your heads, you gates, and those are the gates to the city of Jerusalem because they want to come in, they want to, we're back, we got the ark, we're coming in.
[time=3302] And so to close, we're going to read this together, and you guys are going to be the procession, and I'll be the little door guy who says, who is this king of glory, that'll be me, okay?
[time=3312] And so I'm going to count to three, you guys read lift and make them in, you read that first chunk, and that'll read who is the king of glory, and then you guys read the Lord's strong of mighty, okay?
[time=3321] First service did not do well, but you guys are smarter, you're better, you're second hour, you're more awake, things are going, okay.
[time=3328] So on the count of three, one, two, three, all right, time on, time on, time on.
[time=3339] Have you guys ever seen Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark?
