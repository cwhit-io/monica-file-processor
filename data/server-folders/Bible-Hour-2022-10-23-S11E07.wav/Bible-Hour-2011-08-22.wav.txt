[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It is good to be with you and I gotta tell you, out of the gate here today, over the last couple, two or three weeks, I've probably been approached by no less than 30 people who have at the mall or at the gas station or at the hospital or wherever I might be, stop me and thank me for what we do week after week here with this broadcast.
[time=54] I've been teaching on a regular basis here at Black Hawk for almost 12 years.
[time=59] And I sometimes forget how many thousands of people are out there every week watching.
[time=65] And for us to know that our broadcast encourages you spiritually, for us to be aware of the fact that God is using our efforts to grow you in your faith or even that God is using us to help you in your journey toward faith is an enormous encouragement to me.
[time=83] So I've just been reminded all over again.
[time=86] I want you to know how grateful we are for you and I'm thankful that you tune in week after week.
[time=92] Hey, I wanna tell you about a series that's coming up in September.
[time=95] You can go to our website and see it.
[time=97] I wanna tell you about it this morning.
[time=98] It's a series we'll begin on September 11, Sunday morning, September 11.
[time=102] The series is entitled, Are All Sins the Same?
[time=107] And I want you to think about that.
[time=110] Are All Sins the Same?
[time=112] We wanna go to God's word and look at what he says about this issue of sin and its impact.
[time=120] And I think sometimes over the years we've kind of taken, if you listen to certain people talk, we've kind of taken some sins and almost created different categories of sin.
[time=131] These sins are really, really bad.
[time=133] And this sin is sort of bad and this sin is not so bad.
[time=138] And I wanna know what you think about that.
[time=140] You can go to our website and on the homepage there, there's a chance for you to kind of click a button and share with me some thoughts, literally just type me some thoughts about this issue of are all sins the same?
[time=152] What have you learned about this?
[time=154] What do you think or feel about this question?
[time=156] I can't wait to jump in on that morning and really open up the scriptures and begin to help us think through this issue of sin.
[time=165] Are there categories or are all sins the same?
[time=168] And if all sins are the same is the ripple effect or the consequence of sin different in different cases of sin, some great questions for us to consider.
[time=180] Hey, I wanna just say one more thing and that is a happy birthday, a real happy birthday to my 50 year old friend, Pastor Anthony Pettis at Greater Progressive.
[time=191] Anthony, you've been a good friend to me.
[time=193] Anthony, you have been a great support to our ministry.
[time=197] Blackhawk and Greater Progressive have been able to develop and enjoy a great ministry partnership and friendship and I wanna just say to you how thankful I am for your 50 years.
[time=208] Your teaching of God's word has made greater progressive better.
[time=211] Your vision for the kingdom has made the church of Fort Wayne better and I'm thankful for you in my life.
[time=218] So happy birthday to you.
[time=220] And to the rest of you again, thanks for tuning in.
[time=222] It's great to have you with us.
[time=224] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=226] I hope someday you'll just walk through these front doors, come down to the front, say hello to me and join us live and in person.
[time=233] Until then, God bless you.
[time=235] I hope the word of God encourages you today.

[time=794] (audience applauding) (audience applauding) I love that song of hope.
[time=806] It's not just a song that I love to play this morning,
[time=813] but it's a song that's been really meaningful to me and my wife over the last couple of months.
[time=818] I'm thankful for all of you that lit candles today.
[time=824] I would have too.
[time=826] I was busy.
[time=829] But those feelings of confusion and despair are not unknown to me.
[time=835] And I want to share with you just a couple of things over the last few months that I've learned because I want to encourage you, all of you candlelighters today, with some truths that I think God showed me and in some ways thrust upon me.
[time=853] And it's been really good to have him do that because sometimes when you are a candle lighter, you need to do some things in order to continue on.
[time=864] So just a couple of things for you this morning.
[time=870] You may feel those of you who let candles like not being here today.
[time=875] It may be hard to come and gather with the body of Christ.
[time=880] And I just want to encourage you to not forsake meeting with us, just keep coming.
[time=886] God's presence is unique when the body's gathered.
[time=891] And he speaks to me in unique ways when we're all in the same room.
[time=896] And I just want to encourage you to keep gathering.
[time=898] I also want to keep reminding you to connect with other people.
[time=905] Not only were you authentic with God today when you lit your candle, but you were authentic with all of us because you stood up out of your seat and we got to see you go light a candle.
[time=915] And I hope that there's someone in the room or in your family or a friend that loves Jesus a lot, that you can go explain why your candle was lit this morning because it's so important to stay connected to other people.
[time=930] And also encourage anyone who lit a candle today to not stop serving just because you're hurting or because you're confused.
[time=941] Doesn't mean that you should stop serving the verse.
[time=945] Those who sow in tears will reap in joy has come to mean something new and different to me.
[time=950] Just a few days after my daughter's diagnosis, we were on a plane to go serve and help missionaries.
[time=960] And that was not something I would have planned, but that was the best thing for me to sow in tears and then just reap the joy that comes from putting others needs above your own.
[time=973] And then lastly, just to challenge all of you with something that Kelly mentioned a few weeks ago, keep praising all the Psalms that Kelly took us to at the beginning of the month where this almost was experiencing pain and heartache.
[time=991] Every one of them had a line in there about praising God.
[time=995] And one of them in particular said to praise God in the midst of the congregation, "Make it a public declaration of your praise." And I loved one thing Kelly told us a few weeks ago.
[time=1007] He said, "How in the world would praise be born "out of heartache?" And he said, "It's because God's eternal attributes "transcend our momentary pain." So this morning, in obedience to God's word and in line with that thought of Kelly's from a few weeks ago, I'd like all of us to finish our worship time this morning by standing to our feet and singing this song of praise again.
[time=1032] So would you join me?
[time=1034] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 142 seconds]
[time=1194] - Hey, a lot to get to this morning.
[time=1196] And so let's just jump right on in.
[time=1197] Would you open your Bibles to Psalm 5?
[time=1200] Psalm 5, we come to one of the great classic Psalms.
[time=1204] Of all of them written by our man David himself, Psalm 5.
[time=1208] We've entitled this talk this morning, peace in the midst of pain.
[time=1212] And let me just read for you if I can, Psalm 5 verses one to six.
[time=1217] It says, "Give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my groaning.
[time=1221] "Heed the sound of my cry for help, my King and my God, "for to you I pray.
[time=1227] "In the morning, O Lord, you will hear my voice.
[time=1230] "In the morning, I will order my prayer to you "and eagerly watch, for you are not a God "who takes pleasure in wickedness.
[time=1239] "No evil dwells with you.
[time=1240] "The boastful shall not stand before your eyes.
[time=1244] "You hate all who do iniquity.
[time=1246] "You destroy those who speak falsehood.
[time=1248] "The Lord abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.
[time=1253] "At first glance, it is your normal run of the mill,
[time=1259] "tough day for old King David song." But the truth is, and I've told you this before, oftentimes when you get the chance to understand what we call historical context, you understand the Bible was not written in a vacuum.
[time=1277] The Bible, you most of you know, was written in the midst of real life that these people were facing and experiencing.
[time=1284] And when you understand the historical context within which some five is written, when you get some insight into what was really going on with David, then you begin to understand this is way, way more than a bad day.
[time=1299] The historical context brings insight.
[time=1307] His son, Absalom, David's flesh and blood.
[time=1312] His son, Absalom, is trying to kill him as he pens Psalm five.
[time=1320] He's trying to kill him.
[time=1322] He's attacking not only his life, but his throne.
[time=1327] He's engaged in a vicious, relentless attack on David's life.
[time=1334] It is a hateful attack.
[time=1336] It is a lethal attack and it is without conscience.
[time=1340] Absalom has gone completely over the deep end.
[time=1345] And David has fought and battled against and wrestled to the death with animals, rebellious legions and foreign kings and yet now his own son wants to cut his head off.
[time=1356] It is a, it is a, couldn't be any worse circumstance
[time=1364] that he faces his own son coming after him with a vengeance, with an evil vile hatred.
[time=1374] And so now with some historical context, would you stand and in honor of God's word, let me read this to you again.
[time=1384] I'm just gonna read these first few verses this time, but I want you to now listen to it through the lens of what was reality for David in his life.
[time=1393] Give ear to my words, he's probably in hiding.
[time=1397] As he runs, give ear to my words, oh Lord, consider my groaning, heed the sound of my cry for help my king and my God, for to you I pray, in the morning, oh Lord, you will hear my voice in the morning, I will order my prayer to you and eagerly watch.
[time=1423] - Our Father in heaven, we stand before you this morning
[time=1429] as a people who have been willing this morning to praise you in the midst of whatever circumstance we may find ourselves in.
[time=1438] And this morning, God, as we open up your word, we find David in a circumstance that couldn't have been more painful, that couldn't have been any worse than it was.
[time=1448] So God, as we hear his heart this morning may what he says and what you have put together here for us in your word, oh God, may it minister to us, may it give us direction, may it give us hope, may it give us even more insight, God into your character and your grace.
[time=1467] May we be a people whose hearts and souls and lives are buoyed up this morning because of the great truth.
[time=1475] We've been privileged to hear.
[time=1477] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1482] Amen, you can be seated.
[time=1483] So many times as we come to this topic
[time=1490] of David crying out to God, which is what he does here, he cries out to God.
[time=1496] I wanna just say this to you and then we'll talk more about it here this morning.
[time=1499] So many times my friends, we don't, you and I, we don't cry right.
[time=1505] Did you know there was a way to cry?
[time=1509] I wanna just submit to you this morning that there is.
[time=1513] I want you to look closely with me this morning at David's cry because it is a clinic on how to cry.
[time=1522] It is an absolute textbook example of how it is
[time=1528] that you and I can in those couldn't be any worse moments, how we can with great authenticity and under the umbrella of great truth, cry out to God in a way that honors him.
[time=1542] The first thing I want you to see here about David's cry is that it was early in the week I had written discouraged.
[time=1551] The more I read and the more I studied, we changed that to desperate.
[time=1556] My friends, this is a desperate cry.
[time=1560] And as we study the passage and as we start out here in these initial verses, I just wanna say, maybe it's the obvious, but maybe for some of the room, it's not, I wanna just make sure you understand it's okay to be desperate before God.
[time=1573] David's cry is desperate.
[time=1575] How do we know that it's desperate?
[time=1577] I wanna draw your attention to a phrase here in verse one.
[time=1580] It starts out, "Give ear to my words, O Lord." And then I want you to write this down on your note sheet.
[time=1587] Consider my groaning.
[time=1590] I just want you to write that down.
[time=1592] Consider my groaning in that phrase we understand or we get insight into how desperate David is.
[time=1603] Let's start with that word, consider.
[time=1605] The Hebrew word there for consider is odds on.
[time=1608] If you wanted to write that down, O-D-D-Z-A-N, odds on.
[time=1612] And odds on means this, odds on means when someone says, "Oh, please consider," they're asking the one to whom they're speaking, the one to whom they're making the request, they're saying, "Would you please cup your hand "around your ear?
[time=1629] "Would you please lean forward "and in with your cupped hand "and your leaning forward posture?
[time=1636] "Would you with great intent "and with great energy, listen to what I am saying?" Odds on, consider.
[time=1645] This is what my, this is what my kids would wish
[time=1653] from me more often when they're talking to me with my cell phone.
[time=1657] Sort of funny, sort of not.
[time=1663] It's what those who really, really need you to listen to them,
[time=1670] need you to do, they need you to not miss this one.
[time=1675] They need you to listen.
[time=1679] And David says, "Oh God, please cup your hand "around your ear.
[time=1684] "I know you, God.
[time=1685] "I know you can and will." And would you lean into this?
[time=1688] Would you listen with real focus and with real intent?
[time=1693] Oh, please God, don't miss this one.
[time=1698] Have you ever been there, I know many of you have.
[time=1702] Have you ever been there offering up, oh, please God, don't miss this one.
[time=1706] Prayers.
[time=1707] This is where David finds himself.
[time=1710] He asks this of God with great confidence because he knows God.
[time=1716] Go to Psalm 34, if you will, please.
[time=1719] You see in Psalm 34, just a couple of examples of this, Psalm 34, 15.
[time=1726] Psalm 34, 15 gives us great hope and it gives us great promise on this front.
[time=1731] The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous and his ears are open to their what?
[time=1738] Say it, church, their cry.
[time=1741] The eyes of the Lord, verse 15 are toward the righteous and his ears are open to their cry.
[time=1749] 17, the righteous what?
[time=1751] Say it, church.
[time=1753] The righteous cry and the Lord what?
[time=1756] Here's and delivers them out of some of their troubles.
[time=1761] No, he delivers them out of all of their troubles.
[time=1767] Consider, he says, consider, oh God, please, hear my cry.
[time=1774] Consider my groaning, I told you to write that phrase down.
[time=1778] This phrase gives us indication into how desperate David really was.
[time=1781] The word groaning, it's an interesting word.
[time=1783] Listen, it is so bad for David that while David starts out, verse one, give ear to my what?
[time=1790] Give ear to my words, what he really means, he clarifies in the very next line.
[time=1797] He says give ear to my words, but then quickly, he comes back to consider my groaning, my groaning.
[time=1808] What he really means is just, oh God, God just makes sense of my groans,
[time=1817] make sense of my confused, painful feelings.
[time=1824] David speaks here of the reality of an emotion in you
[time=1831] and in me where deep unsettled longings, which no language and no words can convey somehow come out and somehow God makes perfect sense of them.
[time=1844] Have you ever been there?
[time=1847] I know many of you, I know many of you in the room have.
[time=1852] And what a joy to know that God meets us at that place.
[time=1859] What a joy to know that in Romans eight, it says the spirit makes intercession for us in those places and at those times where we don't even know what to say, he comes in and he intercedes what a joy for us today to know that God meets us in this place and can decipher and wants to hear your groans.
[time=1881] What a joy to know that we're welcomed at the throne of grace with our grunts and our sobs and our yells and our cries.
[time=1895] Hebrews four, 16, you'll see it on the screen.
[time=1898] Therefore, let us draw near.
[time=1900] I hope every one of you will be encouraged by this and be reminded of this truth.
[time=1905] Therefore, let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace so that we may receive with all of our groaning and with all of our tears and with all of our confusion and all of our despair.
[time=1919] May we with confidence come to the throne of grace so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
[time=1928] It was one of the great joys, maybe.
[time=1932] It was just one of the benefits of being a father to many of you in the room will remember this when you were a parent to a one year old or an 18 month old, I'm trying to think back.
[time=1946] It was somewhere in that timeframe where when the 18 month old comes up to you and they're just distraught and they just, they come running to you and they look up at you and they just, and they just go ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[time=1963] And you don't have any idea, right?
[time=1969] What they're saying, but you just know they're what?
[time=1972] They're hurting and you just pick them up and you just put your arms around them and they just cry and just pat them on the back.
[time=1981] That's a groan, it's just when it's all falling apart and you don't even know what to say, you can't even say it, you're just a little baby.
[time=1991] And there he is to just scoop you up, hold on to you.
[time=1994] That's what David's going through here, consider my groaning, it is a desperate cry.
[time=2001] His desperate cry, point number two,
[time=2007] in your outline there, your note outline, thank you again, Steve Webster.
[time=2012] Point number two is desperate cry was offered in the right direction.
[time=2020] Please make note of that, it was offered in the right direction.
[time=2025] Two things I wanna just quickly make note of here.
[time=2028] The first thing, it might be really obvious to everybody in the room, but there might be some who could use a little help or encouragement here.
[time=2037] First thing I just wanna note is who it was in fact, offered to, who this desperate cry was offered to.
[time=2044] Look at verse two, "Heed the sound of my cry for help,
[time=2050] "who my King and my God." This is who he takes his cry to.
[time=2058] You say what's your point, my point is this, he doesn't take it to a co-worker.
[time=2066] First, he doesn't take it to a chat room, he doesn't take it to a bar, he doesn't take it to the mall, he doesn't take it to the refrigerator, he doesn't take you with me.
[time=2079] He takes his pain, he takes his hurt, he takes this unnerving, unbelievable heartache that he's going through as his son tracks him down like an animal to kill him and he takes it to God.
[time=2096] I told you earlier, there's times we don't cry right, and this is what I'm referring to.
[time=2103] And I wanna just say this to you who are young and I wanna say this to you who are old and I wanna say this to students and I wanna say this to young kids, I wanna say it to anybody who's listening, take your pain to God and take your pain to God first.
[time=2125] He wants to and can sustain you.
[time=2127] He wants to and can give you hope.
[time=2130] He wants to and can nudge you in the right direction.
[time=2134] He wants to hold you.
[time=2136] He wants to pat you on the back and reassure you of his love and grace.
[time=2142] Take your pain to God.
[time=2146] Others are more tangible.
[time=2152] Swiping that credit card may bring more immediate relief.
[time=2155] I don't know.
[time=2156] The list is long of ways in which we cry or deal with our pain in unhealthy fashions, but I am here today.
[time=2165] We are here to remind you of the fact that he is a God who is near.
[time=2171] His eyes and his ears are toward the righteous.
[time=2175] He hears your cry and he delivers you from your trouble.
[time=2181] Amen?
[time=2183] So get alone, some of you struggle with that.
[time=2186] So get alone with him.
[time=2190] Be alone in your pain.
[time=2193] Be alone with him in solitude and devotion and let him hear you.
[time=2202] Let him hold you.
[time=2203] Let him recalibrate your mind and your heart.
[time=2208] Who was it that David's desperate cry was offered to?
[time=2213] To the Lord.
[time=2215] Second thing I want to just note here.
[time=2217] I just think it's interesting and it's a great reminder is that you see there in the text, well, we just read it.
[time=2225] He'd the sound of my cry for help.
[time=2226] My David says, "My who, my who said, my king." It's just cool.
[time=2234] Here's the regal, loved, adored, mighty, powerful king, David.
[time=2239] And remember Israel.
[time=2248] Remember, remember God never wanted Israel to have kings.
[time=2251] God wanted to be Israel's what?
[time=2254] King, it's the way it was designed, but they whined and they moaned and they complained.
[time=2260] They wanted a king and so God gave him kings.
[time=2265] And it didn't go so well, but here comes one who's actually a pretty amazing king in his own right.
[time=2272] Regal, loved, adored, mighty, powerful king, David.
[time=2275] And yet he knows, he knows, who's really his, what?
[time=2282] His king.
[time=2283] And he comes before his king.
[time=2288] And David's king is your king.
[time=2292] He is your sovereign.
[time=2294] He is your Lord.
[time=2296] He is your master.
[time=2298] And he is the one we praise this morning in lift tie.
[time=2301] And he is the one we come under with all of our hurt and pain and confusion.
[time=2306] King of kings, the Lord of lords.
[time=2310] A desperate cry offered in the right direction.
[time=2314] Here we go, let's keep going through the text at the right what, at the right time.
[time=2319] This appropriate crying out to God comes at the right time.
[time=2325] I want you to see it there in verse three.
[time=2327] In the morning, in the morning, oh Lord, you will hear my voice.
[time=2334] David makes this declaration in the midst of his pain.
[time=2337] You will hear my voice in the morning.
[time=2340] In the morning, I will, he goes further.
[time=2343] I will order my prayer to you and eagerly watch.
[time=2348] Now, what's this saying?
[time=2350] Is it saying that all meaningful, godly, quiet times must happen at 5.30 a.m.?
[time=2359] No.
[time=2360] It's not what it's saying necessarily.
[time=2363] What it means is this, and please don't miss this church, what it means is that in the midst of life, in the midst of normal everyday life, or in the midst of life with its heartache and pain, the routine of your day should begin with God.
[time=2377] And I don't know when your day begins.
[time=2381] You may work all night and come home and sleep and wake up at 12.
[time=2384] Your routine should begin with God.
[time=2386] I don't know what your work schedule.
[time=2390] I don't know what your literal hours look like.
[time=2393] It's not the point.
[time=2394] The point is whenever it is your beginning, make sure that you make time to begin your routine with God.
[time=2403] Intense Bible study for 45 minutes or an hour is good.
[time=2408] 20 minutes in a devotional is great.
[time=2412] 15 minutes of pure Bible reading, very good journaling, confessing sin, excellent, all of that's good, but look back at the text.
[time=2422] Look back at the text, in the morning, I will order my, what, my prayer.
[time=2430] Here we see the psalmist and here we see an opportunity for you and I to be engaged in God in the morning as the day begins before the routine goes any further.
[time=2441] In prayer, in prayer.
[time=2444] It's the Hebrew phrase, a rock.
[time=2446] You can write that down, A-R-A-K, a rock.
[time=2450] And it means to lay down or arrange in an orderly fashion.
[time=2455] I love that.
[time=2457] What's this mean?
[time=2458] What it means is that if, and I wanna highlight that, if you're beyond groaning.
[time=2463] 'Cause you may be back at 18 months.
[time=2467] You may be back at just, ah, okay, but if you are past groaning and you can actually put words together then in the morning, take them, talk them thoroughly through to him.
[time=2485] The words that are on your heart, the realities of your life, go ahead and with him in that quiet moment in whatever quiet place that is, order your prayers to him, spell it out to him.
[time=2500] Words of thanks, words of confession, words of begging him for help and strength, words of prayers for other people who you love.
[time=2512] See, this is important.
[time=2514] This is very, very important that you and I would no matter who you are, no matter how old you are, start your routine with him.
[time=2524] The word of rock was used to describe the arranging of the wood and the different pieces of the sacrificial animal on the altar before God.
[time=2537] It's this great picture.
[time=2539] I mean, those who were priests in the temple, when it was time for the sacrifice, there was a way in which that wood got stacked and there was a way in which the parts of that sacrificed animal got intertwined in the midst of all that wood.
[time=2557] There was some order there.
[time=2559] There was some preparation.
[time=2561] It got a rock that got laid out.
[time=2564] Here it is, really clear for God to see, and in this case, for God to hear.
[time=2574] Your am's, your mornings should begin with him.
[time=2579] It is a desperate cry in the right direction at the right time with the right attitude.
[time=2588] And we're still in verse three.
[time=2591] I can't wait for you to see this.
[time=2593] In the morning, oh Lord, you will hear my voice.
[time=2598] In the morning, I will order my prayer to you and eagerly is the word he uses.
[time=2607] This is how he cries.
[time=2609] He says, I will eagerly watch.
[time=2612] Eagerly watch, it means to anticipate.
[time=2615] It means to look forward to the Hebrew word for eagerly watches saphah, S-A-W-F-A-W, saphah.
[time=2623] And is to watch with aggression.
[time=2627] Did you get that?
[time=2629] Imagine yourself or picture someone anticipating watching, looking for, with aggression.
[time=2636] It's not passive, it's not detached, it's not, it's not, I don't really think this is gonna happen.
[time=2643] No, no, no, no, there is a great and solid anticipation.
[time=2649] It is an aggressive, peering, intently, scanning the horizon with energy and passion for what you know, what you believe, what you hope is coming.
[time=2663] And I just was talking to a friend this week and we were thinking these things through together and I just got reminded, open your Old Testament, go back to First Kings, would you?
[time=2674] Go to First Kings 18.
[time=2678] I want you to see this picture in First Kings 18 and I want you to allow this picture to paint for you a picture of what it looks like for you in this place of eagerly watching and waiting for God.
[time=2696] You've been desperate before him.
[time=2700] You've taken your desperateness in the right direction at the right time you faithfully are beginning your days with him and now there's this attitude that we've gotta have and you see this in First Kings 1841.
[time=2717] In 1841 now Elijah, you see it there, said to Ahab, go up Ahab, go up, eat and drink for there is the sound of the roar of a heavy shower.
[time=2731] Now stop right there and I want to just, most of you maybe in the room know the story here.
[time=2737] This verse 41 comes after verse 40 and in verse 40 is where Elijah, the prophet of God who has just in essence gone to battle against Baal.
[time=2749] He's gone to battle against evil.
[time=2752] He has challenged all the prophets of Baal and the prophets of Asherah.
[time=2757] Over 800 prophets are gathered.
[time=2759] The whole of Israel is there and you remember the story, they build their altars and the prophets of Baal build their altar and they put their slaughtered animals on it and they dance and cry out to Baal to come and light the fire.
[time=2773] Nothing happens, they're shown to be fools, they're shown to be empty.
[time=2778] Elijah calls on the true God, builds his altar, throws the animals, drenches it with a gazillion gallons of water and God out of the sky brings lightning and boof, thing just blows up in flames.
[time=2792] It should be a movie.
[time=2793] Somebody's gotta make that movie and we'll all go and just enjoy it.
[time=2798] But Elijah wins, God wins the day.
[time=2801] And the whole thing, the backdrop is there's been this drought, there's been no water, there's been no rain and Elijah says it's gonna come.
[time=2812] And I got a God who can bring it and he goes and he takes the 800 prophets down to the brook Kishan, it says in 40, then Elijah said to the people of Israel, sees the prophets of Baal.
[time=2824] Do not let one of them escape so they seize them and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishan and slew them there.
[time=2831] The guy just killed 800 evil false prophets.
[time=2836] You and I would think that they would just,
[time=2842] he would just be full of confidence and faith.
[time=2847] And now watch this, now Elijah said to Ahab go up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of the roar of a heavy shower.
[time=2858] So this is great Ahab went up to eat and drink, but Elijah went up to the top of Carmel and he crouched down on the earth and put his face between his knees.
[time=2873] A said to his servant, go up now, look toward the sea.
[time=2878] See, there wasn't any sound, there were no clouds.
[time=2884] All the prophets of Baal are dead.
[time=2887] God has won the day, but it's not raining and he knows it.
[time=2892] And he says to his servant, you go up and you look toward the sea and you can just picture him with his face between his knees.
[time=2901] Oh God, please.
[time=2904] Oh God, please, have there be a cloud.
[time=2909] And look what the text says, go up now, look toward the sea.
[time=2911] So he went up the servant then and looked and said, as he came back, there is nothing.
[time=2917] And he said, Elijah said, go back, go back and look again.
[time=2922] Eagerly watching.
[time=2930] He said, go back and look again.
[time=2932] The servant goes back and looks again, comes back and says, no clouds.
[time=2935] And Elijah says, go back and look again.
[time=2937] And the servant goes and top of Carmel and looks toward the sea and there's absolutely nothing.
[time=2941] And he comes back to Elijah, he says, there's no clouds.
[time=2944] And Elijah says, go back and look again.
[time=2946] He's got his face between his knees.
[time=2948] Oh God, please, go back and look again.
[time=2951] He goes and looks, he comes back and Elijah, there's nothing.
[time=2954] He doesn't go once, twice, three, four, five, six times.
[time=2958] He sends him back seven times.
[time=2960] Oh please God.
[time=2964] And he comes back.
[time=2967] After seven times it came about at the seventh time, he said, behold, a cloud as small as a man's hand is coming up from the sea.
[time=2978] And boom, that's it.
[time=2981] Elijah said, go up, say it, hey, have, prepare your chariot and go down so that the heavy shower does not stop you.
[time=2988] In a little while the sky grew black with clouds and wind and there was a heavy shower and they have rode and went to Jezreel and I love this part.
[time=2998] We don't want to miss 46th and the hand of the Lord was on Elijah and he girded up his loins and he outran Ahab to Jezreel.
[time=3008] It feels good when God finally answers, doesn't it?
[time=3011] And I read that to you this morning and I want to just encourage you in the room today, many of you, many of us, need to spend some time today or tomorrow and the weeks to come.
[time=3027] Many of us could use some time with our heads between our knees on the ground, begging God for those things that we need, having a right and appropriate cry out to him.
[time=3043] As Corbin comes, I want to just encourage you with this.
[time=3048] Before we leave, I want to encourage you with what it was, listen, how in the world could David cry out to God in such an appropriate way?
[time=3061] How could you sit on the earth with your head
[time=3067] between your knees and cry out to God in an appropriate fashion?
[time=3072] Well, the answer is, and let me just, you know what, let me just say this to you.
[time=3077] Why don't you bow your heads?
[time=3078] Just take a second here.
[time=3080] Why don't you just bow your heads and close your eyes and let me just read this to you.
[time=3084] Please keep listening, my friend's the reason that David was able to cry out to God in an appropriate way was because he trusted in and he knew the character of God.
[time=3101] What do I mean by that?
[time=3105] Well, you go home today and keep reading in Psalm 5.
[time=3109] It says in verse four, having poured out his heart in one, two, and three, it says in verse four, for you are not a God who takes pleasure and wickedness.
[time=3119] I know this, that means God's fair, doesn't take pleasure and wickedness.
[time=3127] No evil dwells within you, God.
[time=3131] It means he's pure.
[time=3133] The boastful shall not stand before your eyes.
[time=3140] David had seen this play out time and time before.
[time=3143] David experienced this in his own life.
[time=3145] The boastful shall not stand before you.
[time=3148] God is just.
[time=3150] You hate all who do iniquity.
[time=3155] You see, David knew God was holy.
[time=3158] Verse six, you destroy those who speak falsehood.
[time=3163] David knew that God was righteous.
[time=3167] And the Lord abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.
[time=3171] David knew that God was honest.
[time=3173] His son's trying to take his head off.
[time=3178] He's groaning.
[time=3181] Can't even find words that despair is so deep, but he knows that God is fair and pure and just and holy and righteous and honest.
[time=3193] And my friends, listen, he always is all of these things.
[time=3198] Here you go, in his time, in his place and in his way.
[time=3205] And his time and his place and his ways aren't yours.
[time=3212] And they certainly aren't mine.
[time=3216] I said this last month is so many of us
[time=3222] and hundreds of others gathered to pay tribute to Steve and Kim Hatch's lives.
[time=3227] I said, when God doesn't make sense, when the pain and heartache behind your groans
[time=3235] creates confusion about God, remember.
[time=3240] Remember what isn't confusing about God.
[time=3244] Remember what you do know about him and put your head between your knees and wait.
[time=3253] And believe as you wait, there's the psalmist said in Psalm 27 that you will see the land of the living.
[time=3262] Wait, wait on the Lord, take courage.
[time=3267] Oh Father in heaven, there are many in the room this morning
[time=3273] who feel and sense the pain of David and we want to just give them a chance to be before you and church as I pray here as we close, I want to just invite you, anybody in the room at all, to just with the very same authenticity that so many of you evidenced as you lit candles this morning, I want to just invite you to stand right where you are quietly and by standing you're saying, I need desperately God's help.
[time=3308] By standing this morning you're saying that you want your cry to be an appropriate cry offered in the right direction, offered at the right time, offered with the right attitude as you stand this morning wherever you are in this room, you're simply submitting yourself to the one who we praise
[time=3329] today, our mighty king, a God who loves you deeply, a God who loves you intimately, and a God who will, please hear me my friends, he will, in his time and in his place and in his way, he will meet you and he will sustain you.
[time=3349] I'll just give you a minute to stand wherever you are.
[time=3354] It's a good thing to stand in the family of God amen.
[time=3359] It's a good thing to not have to stand in front of strangers but instead to stand in the midst of those who love you, who care for you.
[time=3368] And Father God, it is my prayer this morning for these dear friends who stand that you would be fair and pure and just and holy and righteous and honest, that you would come to their rescue, that you would through your word, through your spirit, through your people, just even through your touch.
[time=3392] Oh God, would you come and meet them?
[time=3395] For many who stand this morning, I know that you've been meeting them and they stand because they desperately desire for you to keep meeting them in this place.
[time=3405] Oh God, I pray that those in the room who still, even this morning after what we've heard and discussed, with confusion and anger, still kind of rain, if confusion and distrust,
[time=3425] that still is the dominant feeling and thought, oh God, I know you love them and I do too and I pray that you would continue to nudge them towards your goodness, towards your faithfulness.
[time=3437] God, we know that all questions can't get answered.
[time=3442] We know that everything at the end of the day doesn't always line up, but oh God, we can know that you are faithful and that you will sustain us and that good will come in time.
[time=3455] Father, we are grateful for the chance to worship you this morning so thankful for the great truth that we've been reminded of.
[time=3463] May we be a people, not only who love you and trust you, but may we encourage those around us, those standing next to us.
[time=3470] Give us the strength, encourage and wisdom to do that well and bring us back together if that be your will, for it's in your son's name, in your son, your precious son, our Savior, Jesus Christ, it's in his name that we pray, amen.
[time=3488] (upbeat music)
