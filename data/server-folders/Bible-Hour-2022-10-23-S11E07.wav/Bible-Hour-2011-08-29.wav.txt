[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again everybody and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It's great to have you with us again for the broadcast.
[time=37] And I wanna tell you what you're gonna see today is a message, the last message in our series of summer messages from the Psalms.
[time=46] And we end our series in Psalm 51.
[time=50] And Psalm 51, as some of you may know, is an amazing Psalm where we see right down into the very depths of David's heart.
[time=59] As he comes to God and confesses his sin of adultery with Bathsheba.
[time=65] What a story that is David and Bathsheba and all that transpired there.
[time=71] Needless to say, David is broken, David is contrite, David's heart and soul are as heavy as a heart and soul can be as he comes begging for forgiveness from God, for this heinous sin of not only adultery with Bathsheba but murder, murder of her husband and Uriah.
[time=92] And I wanna just say this to you.
[time=94] I hope today as you watch the broadcast that whoever you are, wherever you are in your life and journey with God and wherever you are as it relates to sin in your life.
[time=107] You've got it and I've got it and sin can be so debilitating.
[time=111] Sin can bring such a weight to your life in mind.
[time=116] And I want you to listen today because while he comes begging for forgiveness, heavy in his heart at the beginning of the passage, I can't wait for you to see the transition, the progress that's made in just the one chapter as God brings his restorative and forgiving power.
[time=134] It's an amazing picture and I can't wait for you to be encouraged and I can't wait for you to learn some things about God and forgiveness and repentance and our sin and I hope it's helpful.
[time=146] It also gives me a chance to tell you about a series that's coming up in the next couple of weeks.
[time=151] We'll start a new series on Sunday morning, September 11th and the series title that we've landed on is are all sins the same?
[time=162] Are all sins the same?
[time=163] And as we think about David M. Bathsheba and adultery, I'm reminded of the fact that a few nights ago I lost my temper with my kids and I wonder as you hear me say that I wonder which sin is worse, the sin of adultery or the sin of anger.
[time=184] I wonder how you view that.
[time=186] What sin is more detrimental?
[time=189] What sin is more heinous?
[time=191] What sin is really more serious?
[time=193] Murder or too much chocolate cake, gluttony?
[time=198] These are questions that we'll be considering over the next several weeks in September and the real issue here is I think we need to have you and me both a proper and accurate view of what God's word says about the nature of sin.
[time=214] And we'll answer the question are all sins the same and we'll talk about the effect sin has and the answer for sin that God gives us in his word.
[time=223] So go to our website and when you go to our website at blackhawkministries.org there's a chance for you to kind of click on below the are all sins the same link and actually share some thoughts with me.
[time=235] Tell me what you think about that question answer that from your own perspective.
[time=239] Let us hear from you and we'd love to take what you give us and allow that to help form and shape our discussion in the days to come.
[time=247] Hey God bless you and I mean that.
[time=249] God bless you and thank you for tuning in.
[time=251] It's great to have this time together and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=256] [MUSIC - 316 seconds]
[time=580] (audience applauding) - Well, my friends, we come this morning
[time=591] to the end of our summer series in the Book of Psalms, and it has been a rich and encouraging and challenging time.
[time=598] We find our way to Psalm 51 this morning.
[time=602] And as we come to Psalm 51, which is a specific and direct response from David, it is a prayer of David's, in direct response to the circumstances surrounding his adultery with Bathsheba and his murder of her husband, Uriah.
[time=620] And with all of that in the backdrop, we come to this 51st Psalm, and we are reminded, my friends, of the great tragedy of sin, and we are reminded at the same time of the great hope that can be born out of it.
[time=638] Forgive me, restore me, use me.
[time=643] This is the prayer of David.
[time=646] And we will see this prayer unfolded.
[time=649] We will unpack its great truth as we make our way through this passage, but I want to start by asking you to do something I rarely ever ask you to do.
[time=657] I don't usually ask people to do this.
[time=660] I don't find it to be a helpful exercise in most cases, but I want to ask you this morning, young and old, to think for these next 40 minutes about your sin.
[time=671] I want you to consider this morning as we begin,
[time=677] because I want this to be as practical, and as every day and as real for you as it was for David, I want you this morning to just in the quietness of your own heart and mind, to pick one.
[time=691] To just consider before God your sinfulness, something that you're struggling with today, something that you have battled with for years, something that happened last night.
[time=703] And with that sin, with that iniquity,
[time=711] whatever you did, whatever you've said, whatever you've thought, wherever you've gone, that is in violation of what you know God has designed for you with your sin.
[time=721] Clearly in view this morning, I want to bring you to Psalm 51 in the heart of David and his prayer for God.
[time=728] You can't come to Psalm 51, my friends, without going back to 2 Samuel 11.
[time=733] Would you do that with me this morning?
[time=734] Would you turn in your Bibles?
[time=736] 2 Samuel 11 verses one to four.
[time=744] Says there in the second book of Samuel 11.1, then it happened in the spring.
[time=752] Oh my, did it.
[time=754] Then it happened in the spring.
[time=757] At the time when kings go out to battle that David sent Joab and his servants with him and all Israel, and they destroyed the sons of Amun and besieged Rabah, but David was not with them.
[time=772] David, you see the text says, stayed at Jerusalem.
[time=776] Now an evening came, David arose, never a good sign to see one getting out of bed in the evening.
[time=784] Something wasn't right, something was wrong.
[time=787] When evening came, David arose from his bed and walked around on the roof of the king's house, and from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful in appearance.
[time=799] So David sent and inquired about the woman, and one said, is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Elleam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite.
[time=810] Well David sent messengers, he wasn't deterred.
[time=817] He sent messengers and took her, and when she came to him, he lay with her.
[time=825] And when she had purified herself from her uncleanness, she returned to her house.
[time=833] And all my, this thing quickly unravels then from this point on David realizing the great sin, realizing the great iniquity, which has been perpetrated upon this woman, seeks to somehow try and cover it up.
[time=848] He, as you know, we won't read the whole story, but he actually sends a word to the battlefield and has her husband sent home.
[time=856] He has her husband sent home with the hopes that he can get him drunk and let him drink the wine and the strong drink, and he sends him to his house.
[time=864] He wants Uriah to go to his house and be with Bathsheba, so hopefully they can in some way cover up what David fears has transpired, but Uriah being the man of integrity that he is won't sleep with his wife.
[time=878] He sleeps on the front porch, 'cause how could he sleep with his wife when his friends are in battle?
[time=884] So David's cover up is thwarted.
[time=887] He's scared, he's panicked, and he's in sin, not a good combination.
[time=892] And so he sends word to the battlefield, literally sends word to the battlefield that Uriah is to be sent to the front line and that the troops are to fall back when Uriah is at the front and as the troops fall back, just as certainly as David had hoped and planned, Uriah is killed in battle.
[time=913] David has committed adultery with Bathsheba, now he has committed murder and God sends Nathan.
[time=920] God sends Nathan the prophet to come and bring before David
[time=926] this sin, this violation of God's law that Nathan brings it.
[time=930] You can pick it up in 2 Samuel 12.
[time=935] I'm gonna start in verse nine.
[time=937] Why have you despised the word of the Lord by doing evil in his sight?
[time=943] You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword, have taken his wife to be your wife and have killed him with the sword, with the sons of Amen.
[time=952] Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house because you have despised me and taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.
[time=961] Thus says the Lord, behold, I will raise up evil against you from your own household.
[time=967] I will even take your wives before your eyes and give them to your companion and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight.
[time=975] Indeed, you did it secretly but I will do this thing before all of Israel and under the sun, listen church, then David said to Nathan, having heard from the Lord, I have sinned against the Lord.
[time=991] And Nathan said to David, the Lord has taken away your sin,
[time=997] you shall not die.
[time=999] However, because by this deed you have given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also that is born to you shall surely die.
[time=1010] So Nathan went to his house.
[time=1013] Then the Lord struck the child that Uriah's widow bore to David so that he was very sick.
[time=1019] David therefore inquired of God for the child and David fasted and went and lay all night on the ground.
[time=1027] The elders of his household stood beside him in order to raise him up from the ground but he was unwilling and would not eat food with them.
[time=1036] Then it happened on the seventh day that the child what died.
[time=1042] And it says, it says in the book of James, my friends,
[time=1052] it's a great reminder for all of us to see it there on the screen.
[time=1059] It says in James chapter one, verse 14, but each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.
[time=1070] Then when lust has conceived it gives birth to what?
[time=1076] Sin.
[time=1078] And when sin is accomplished it brings forth death.
[time=1084] Do not think for a moment that that's not true.
[time=1089] Do not be deceived.
[time=1096] Now somewhere in the midst of all of that remorse and sorrow and regret, David slips away and pens Psalm 51.
[time=1106] And in the process provides us with yet another text book example of what you see in this Psalm as a whole, this textbook example of confession and repentance, this textbook example of deep and honest remorse mixed with appropriate hope and promise.
[time=1126] What an opportunity for us to be encouraged.
[time=1131] What an opportunity for us today to be instructed on how it is we can with a holy God deal with our wretched sin.
[time=1142] Let me ask you this.
[time=1142] Have you ever said, I'm sorry to your spouse?
[time=1146] Have you ever said, I'm sorry to your mom and dad?
[time=1148] Have you ever had to say, I'm sorry to a friend?
[time=1151] Have you ever said, I'm really sorry, but.
[time=1155] Ever thrown that, ever thrown that butt in there?
[time=1160] Ever said, I'm sorry and then explained why you did what you did and in the explanation try to somehow sort of justify why you did it?
[time=1172] Have you ever said, I really messed up, oh God, I really messed up and in your mind thought to yourself and maybe you've said it but maybe I haven't but in your mind you're thinking but at least I'm not as bad as him.
[time=1184] At least I'm not as bad as her.
[time=1188] God, I really messed up but at least I'm not doing what they're doing.
[time=1194] So you will see none of that in this.
[time=1199] This is textbook.
[time=1203] This is how it's done, my friends.
[time=1205] This is a contrite and humble confession.
[time=1208] David's plea, let's look at it together.
[time=1211] David's plea, his plea from the outset of this text is forgive me.
[time=1217] That's what he's saying, oh God forgive me.
[time=1219] Psalm 51 verses one to four, be gracious to me, oh God, according to your loving kindness, according to the greatness of your compassion, blot out my transgressions, wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, cleanse me from my sin.
[time=1236] And he says what you and I could say almost any day of the week for I know my transgressions and my sin is ever before me.
[time=1245] Against you, God, against you only, I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight so that you are justified when you speak and blameless when you judge.
[time=1257] The first thing I want you to notice about this plea, this request for forgiveness is the first four words.
[time=1264] Go ahead and look at it, you can count them.
[time=1267] I want you to see the first four words because I want you to see again church and understand that this is where confession begins, this is where forgiveness begins when he starts with those first four words, be gracious to me.
[time=1286] You see, he starts with a single request for the one thing, for the only thing that can help a sinner.
[time=1294] You understand what that is, right?
[time=1297] You do, don't you?
[time=1300] You understand what the one thing is, the only thing that can help a sinner and that is the grace of God.
[time=1310] And he says in this predicament from the outset, as he steps in to his presence, he says, "Oh God, be gracious." I hope you know, I really hope you understand that there is nothing you can do about your sin.
[time=1326] There is nothing you can fix, there's nothing you can make right.
[time=1331] Forgiveness, what is wrong, spiritually being made right, righteous this being brought into iniquity, only possible by the grace of God.
[time=1343] And David knew this and he says right from the outset, be gracious to me, oh God, look what he says next.
[time=1349] According to the greatness of your compassion, watch these three phrases, blot out my transgressions.
[time=1356] He says, "Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity "and cleanse me from my sin." You know what he's saying there?
[time=1366] He's saying and you know this and I know this.
[time=1368] We've sensed this and felt this.
[time=1369] He's saying, "My sin has left me dirty." My sin has left me dirty.
[time=1376] I'm a sinful mess.
[time=1378] My soul smells.
[time=1384] I was reminded of smell.
[time=1388] I was reminded the other night of really, really bad smell.
[time=1392] A great time hanging out with my buddy, Dr. Greg Sassman-hausen, he's had me at the Duanger game against Concordia football.
[time=1399] It's so much fun just to hang out with him and see these kids play football.
[time=1402] We're over on the sidelines and we're walking behind the bench and as we're walking behind the bench, the Duanger bench, I get a whiff of what I hadn't smelled since my days of playing football, it felt like.
[time=1416] Are you with me?
[time=1417] I'm walking behind the bench.
[time=1418] It's just the bench.
[time=1419] I mean, they're not even like playing.
[time=1421] These guys are standing and I'm 20 feet away and it smelled awful.
[time=1426] It was so cool.
[time=1427] It reminded me of being in high school.
[time=1429] We wouldn't shower after Thursday practice.
[time=1433] Nobody would shower.
[time=1434] We wanted to smell as bad as we could smell.
[time=1437] There was something about being in high school and playing football that was just cool to smell bad.
[time=1441] And I'm walking behind this bench Friday night and it just hits me.
[time=1445] It's just a wave of stench.
[time=1447] And I thought, man, that smells bad.
[time=1451] That's really bad.
[time=1452] It's hard to even like walk past him.
[time=1454] And David says this is exactly his predicament.
[time=1460] He smells awful.
[time=1463] He is dirty.
[time=1464] And he says, blot it out.
[time=1467] He says, wash me.
[time=1468] He says, cleanse me.
[time=1470] Let me just show you these three phrases.
[time=1472] To blot out means to rub.
[time=1474] It literally means in the Hebrew, to rub and scratch till no longer visible on the ledger.
[time=1483] It means to erase, to rub and to scratch until no longer visible on the ledger.
[time=1489] He says, oh God, erase my sin.
[time=1492] He goes on to say, wash me.
[time=1494] You see it there in verse two.
[time=1495] Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.
[time=1499] The word wash there and the phrase wash me kabas in the Hebrew.
[time=1504] Interesting how there is this distinction between wash me and cleanse me.
[time=1509] The phrase wash me there kabas has to do with cleaning the external circumstance.
[time=1517] Something has happened outside of me, right?
[time=1521] Something has happened outside of me and it's dirty.
[time=1525] Something has happened because of my sin.
[time=1528] There are things out here that aren't right that he cries out, oh kabas, wash me.
[time=1535] And then he says cleanse me as the text goes on.
[time=1539] Cleanse me from my sin while kabas meant to wash the external realities and make them right.
[time=1546] Cleanse me is the Hebrew word for internal purification.
[time=1551] Don't just help me by cleaning up all this.
[time=1556] Oh God, help me by cleaning up what's in here because what's in here smells as bad, if not worse.
[time=1565] This is what I've caused out here.
[time=1568] Oh God, listen, he says, oh God, between, this is what he's saying.
[time=1573] He's saying, oh God, between you and me, make it like it wasn't there.
[time=1578] Oh God, make it like it wasn't there.
[time=1582] Reminds me of the great truth.
[time=1583] So many of you I know have found comfort in this.
[time=1587] I have as well.
[time=1588] Psalm 103.
[time=1591] Psalm 103 verse 10 says he has not dealt with us according to our sins.
[time=1597] He hasn't.
[time=1599] I know most of you know that.
[time=1601] I know most of you know what your sins would require if he dealt with us as he should.
[time=1608] He has not dealt with us according to our sin nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
[time=1613] For as high as the heavens are above the earth, that's a long way.
[time=1617] So great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him as far as the east is from the west.
[time=1624] So far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[time=1629] I wanna remind you this morning church while your sins consequences do ripple forward.
[time=1637] They do.
[time=1639] You know that, right?
[time=1641] While your sins consequences do ripple forward.
[time=1646] The great divide between men and God caused by our sin can be erased.
[time=1653] [AMEN] Think about, we've referenced it already a few times.
[time=1660] Romans seven where Paul's talking about his sin and how he does what he doesn't want to do and he doesn't do what he wants to do and he paints this picture of ongoing sin and struggle and strife and this battle within a saved individual who wants desperately in his soul to do what's right but the members of his body war against his soul.
[time=1686] He describes this whole battle with sin who will save me from this body of death thanks be to God who delivers us through Jesus Christ.
[time=1694] Our Lord, end of seven first, verse of chapter eight says there is now, there is therefore now no way.
[time=1702] You know what condemnation is?
[time=1705] It's the separation of God and man.
[time=1708] And there, listen, there is none.
[time=1713] There is no condemnation.
[time=1717] I can't lose him.
[time=1719] He's not gonna lose me.
[time=1722] While the ripples of my sin go forward, the great divide between men and God caused by our sin can be erased.
[time=1730] You and I can experience intimacy again with him.
[time=1735] Let me just get you to think about it for a moment.
[time=1737] How good is it?
[time=1739] So many of you in the room know this.
[time=1741] How good is it to make things right with someone that you've wronged?
[time=1752] How sweet is it really?
[time=1756] Hard getting there, right?
[time=1758] But at the end of the day, how good is it to be able to make things right with the one that you've wronged?
[time=1768] And David knew this and David knew that the one he had wronged was ultimately God and it says right there in the text in verse four against you, you only, I have sinned and done, what is evil in your sight?
[time=1782] My friends, listen, David realizes and sees what every believer seeking forgiveness must see that even though he had tragically wronged Bathsheba and Uriah, his ultimate crime was against God alone and God's law, God and God's law had been violated
[time=1805] and this at the end of the day meant a great deal to David
[time=1811] and watch this, that it meant a great deal to David
[time=1817] is really truly a testimony to his character because listen, this is hard for us in our Western kind of minds, our Western culture to understand this but in Eastern culture, the way this thing worked was he was king and what you have to understand is that a king had no one to answer to.
[time=1840] He couldn't have gotten in trouble for this.
[time=1846] It didn't matter if the whole world knew, there wasn't anybody who could bring a charge, there wasn't any group of people who could bring some kind of ramification, there was nothing that could happen to him, he was above it all, he was king and yet as we talked about last week, he was a king who knew who his king was, right?
[time=1868] And so in the humility and the humbleness and the brokenness of his heart, it's not a, at least I'm not that bad, get over it, plea, no it's a contrite, I need a thorough top-to-bottom
[time=1886] cleansing made possible only by the greatness of your compassion, my king and my God who I have wronged.
[time=1896] It's a humble plea, forgive me and this leads to David's peace, number two, write it down, forgive me, leads to restore me.
[time=1908] David's plea leads to this peace that begins to come over him
[time=1914] as the passage progresses, you see in verses one to three we just read it, you saw it and you sensed it in verses one to three, he's just begging God, he's just begging God to simply and only forgive me.
[time=1929] I mean, he is laid out, he is at the bottom, he is broken, all of this is before him and he's pleading with God for forgiveness.
[time=1940] But now as the text progresses, there is a coming reality that he looks forward to.
[time=1950] Did you hear that?
[time=1952] Are you still thinking about your sin?
[time=1956] There is a coming reality that he actually now
[time=1962] begins to look forward to, a confidence that comes out in the text, he knows, he knows that with God's forgiveness comes the opportunity to once again live.
[time=1975] Look at, go to 51, nine, excuse me, go to 51, six, go to 51, six, behold you desire truth
[time=1986] and the innermost being and in the hidden part, you will make me know now he starts to look to the future, you will make me know wisdom again, purify me with hiss up and I shall be clean, wash me and I shall be wider than snow, make me to hear joy and gladness again, let the bones which you have broken rejoice.
[time=2009] You hear that, you sense it, it's shifting,
[time=2017] all of a sudden with the forgiveness, there begins to be this vision for what can happen, what God can do.
[time=2024] He knows that with God's forgiveness comes the opportunity to be out from under the destruction of sin.
[time=2032] He knows that with God's forgiveness comes the opportunity to be out from and free from the ruin of sin and you need to be and we've got to be reminded this morning that sin does that my friends, sin removes us from life, sin brings nothing but destruction, sin leaves us in ruin and here he begins to look at the great restorative power to restore, to take what is broken and burned and used and make it new and fresh and right.
[time=2068] Beth, Katie found this picture I wanna show you.
[time=2074] It just like hit me when I saw it I was like, wow.
[time=2077] Look at that.
[time=2081] Just look at that for just a moment here, go ahead, just stare at it.
[time=2087] And I know that there are many of you in the room this morning as you stare at that that speaks volumes to you because there are so many of you who wonder like I do at times, can God do anything with me?
[time=2104] And all my brokenness and all my sinfulness, can God do like could he really keep doing things with me that are good?
[time=2111] And you look at that picture and it just screams
[time=2117] the great truth of scripture that he is a God who can make things new.
[time=2124] You will make me no wisdom.
[time=2125] Listen church, you will make me no wisdom.
[time=2128] You think maybe David lost sight of some discerning wisdom in his sins, certainly he did, but now he knows God will bring wisdom anew.
[time=2138] He says, I shall be clean.
[time=2140] He says, I shall be wider than snow.
[time=2142] That means I will be right and I will be righter than right.
[time=2146] God will make me as right as I've ever been.
[time=2149] I love what he says, I will hear joy and gladness.
[time=2155] I've got this quote in my office.
[time=2158] Oh, to hear again the voice of God and the symbols of his people's praise once muted so severely by my foolish sin and rebellion.
[time=2167] I've talked to people, you've talked to people who have said on the heels of confession and in the midst of their repentance as they move away from sin, I have heard people say for years how sweet it is to be back in the gathering, how sweet it is to be back in their small group, how sweet it is to once again be able to worship God.
[time=2191] With his people I will hear joy and gladness again.
[time=2195] David says, my broken bones will rejoice.
[time=2197] People ask me about this broken bone thing.
[time=2200] Is it literal?
[time=2201] It could be, God could break your bone.
[time=2203] In the text here, mostly figurative, listen, it is a figure of speech alluding to the framework of the entire person, he was literally breaking apart.
[time=2217] It was a total personal collapse under the weight of sin.
[time=2222] Psalm 32.
[time=2226] Psalm 32, three, when I kept silent about my sin,
[time=2233] my body wasted away through my groaning all day long.
[time=2239] For day and night your hand was heavy upon me.
[time=2243] My vitality was drained away as with the fever, heat of summer when he kept quiet about his sin, but thanks be to God that he's no longer keeping quiet about his sin, right?
[time=2257] Now he speaks up.
[time=2259] Now there is no more silence.
[time=2261] And I just want you to pause here.
[time=2264] We got some time left.
[time=2266] We're gonna come back in a moment and just say a few things.
[time=2269] But all my friends, please listen.
[time=2271] Listen to the song that God has put on our heart these days,
[time=2277] Corbin and Tan, you're gonna sing it.
[time=2279] I know many of you in the room maybe are already praying
[time=2285] this prayer.
[time=2287] Many of you in the room are already thinking, oh God forgive me.
[time=2292] And oh God, if you would restore me.
[time=2297] Now I wanna ask if you would to just bow your heads and close your eyes.
[time=2300] I wanna remind you of the great truth of God's word that forgiveness brings healing.
[time=2306] Jonathan and Corbin sang about it last week.
[time=2309] Beauty rises out of ashes.
[time=2312] With God my friends hope is born out of hurt.
[time=2317] He is a God who makes sinners clean.
[time=2321] He makes all things new.
[time=2325] He really does, he really does restore.
[time=2329] And so as you pray that prayer, as you think those thoughts, listen.
[time=2334] Listen to the words of the song be encouraged and be blessed.
[time=2339] He makes things beautiful.
[time=2341] (gentle music)
[time=2355] [MUSIC - 260 seconds]
[time=2620] - You know what's really true?
[time=2624] It is absolutely completely true that that is what
[time=2630] our God does.
[time=2631] I look around this room this morning and I've told you before, one of the great joys of being able to be somewhere for a while is you just get the privilege of seeing God do really amazing things.
[time=2649] And I look around this room and I see a lot of beautiful
[time=2655] things.
[time=2655] I see a lot of beautiful things that God has done
[time=2662] with you and your failure and your struggle and your heartache.
[time=2668] And I have watched him birth and I have watched him grow in this family, beautiful things.
[time=2673] And you may be sitting here this morning thinking the years of yeah, but he's not doing anything beautiful with me.
[time=2679] Oh, Kelly, if you only knew where I am, if you only knew what I've done.
[time=2685] And I wanna just remind you, read the chapter.
[time=2691] He slept with and murdered.
[time=2695] And there isn't anything that you can do or I can do.
[time=2700] There's nothing David could do.
[time=2702] On the heels of forgiveness comes restoration.
[time=2705] And my friends, I'm here to tell you in these next just few minutes that on the heels of restoration comes an amazing thing.
[time=2712] I told you at the beginning of our morning, forgive me, restore me.
[time=2716] And what was the third one?
[time=2718] Use me.
[time=2720] David's plea is forgive me.
[time=2722] David's peace is restore me.
[time=2725] And now we come to the end of this humble prayer and we see David's plan, really his hope.
[time=2730] It's God's plan.
[time=2731] It's his hope.
[time=2732] David's plan, use me.
[time=2735] Use me.
[time=2736] Before I read it to you, I wanna just read verses 10 to 12.
[time=2741] Interesting, as you study Psalm 51, verses 10 to 12 is like this little synopsis.
[time=2746] It kinda takes the whole first part, verses one to nine and in 10 to 12, it just summarizes the whole thing.
[time=2753] And what a great summary it is.
[time=2755] Creating me a clean heart, oh God.
[time=2757] And renew a steadfast spirit within me.
[time=2760] Do not, it's the one thing David hoped wouldn't happen.
[time=2764] And now he begins to see that it won't do not cast me away from your presence.
[time=2768] Don't take your Holy Spirit from me.
[time=2771] Restore to me the one thing that sin makes me lose.
[time=2775] Restore to me the joy of your salvation and sustain me with a willing spirit.
[time=2781] And here we go.
[time=2781] You ready for this?
[time=2783] David's plan.
[time=2784] Listen, people, David believed.
[time=2787] He really did.
[time=2788] David believes, having been forgiven and restored, that now he'll be able to teach transgressors.
[time=2797] Your way, he says, then I will teach transgressors your way and sinners will be converted to you.
[time=2805] Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, oh God, the God of my salvation, then my tongue will joyfully sing of your righteousness.
[time=2812] Oh Lord, open my lips that my mouth may declare your praise for you do not delight in sacrifice.
[time=2821] Otherwise, I would give it.
[time=2822] You are not pleased with burnt offerings.
[time=2825] The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart.
[time=2831] Oh God, you will not despise.
[time=2833] Here's what I want you to see.
[time=2834] Ready?
[time=2835] Here's what I want you to sense.
[time=2836] I don't want you to just see it.
[time=2838] I want those of you in the room this morning who are literally dealing with these things in your own life and circumstance to see this, that he starts this chapter flat on his face, broken in sackcloth and ashes, everything is over.
[time=2857] Everything has crumbled and he lays there and basically is simply able to only say, just if you'll just forgive me.
[time=2868] It's all he's interested in at the beginning is, oh God, somehow please blot this out.
[time=2874] Wretched man that I am.
[time=2878] He starts there and I just want you to see and since this morning that as he moves from forgiveness to restoration and, oh yeah, the reality that you do make things new.
[time=2892] There's this new energy, there's this new perspective and now he comes to the end of the chapter that began on his face.
[time=2899] Now he's over here at verse 13 going, you know what?
[time=2903] You know what?
[time=2903] I'm gonna, I'm gonna, with your help, God, because of what you've done, I'm gonna teach transgressors your ways.
[time=2910] Now he's back.
[time=2913] Now he's back in the game.
[time=2917] Teach transgressors.
[time=2919] That word transgressors is a reference to those already convinced these would be believers in God.
[time=2926] These are those who have fallen like he fell.
[time=2929] Transgressors are those who know the truth and know the line and step over it and he's gonna go as one who has experienced forgiveness and restoration and he's gonna teach transgressors God's ways.
[time=2943] Sinners, he's gonna convert sinners.
[time=2946] He's flat on his face out of the game just begging for a big divine bar of soap.
[time=2954] And now he's over here saying, you know what?
[time=2956] You know what?
[time=2957] Because of your forgiveness and because of your restoration, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, with your help, I'm gonna bring people far from God and they're far from God because of their, what?
[time=2967] Say it, sin, and I'm going to as a forgiven person help them understand forgiveness.
[time=2977] And I sure hope you would.
[time=2981] I sure hope you would be willing to do this.
[time=2984] I hope there would be in you as you consider your sin this morning and as you consider his forgiveness and his restored of power, the willingness to teach transgressors, to convert sinners.
[time=2997] He goes on, look at 14.
[time=2999] He says, then my tongue will joyfully sing of your righteousness.
[time=3004] We've alluded to this.
[time=3005] I'll just say this, forgiven people, my friends, forgiven, restored people I think should sing their hearts out.
[time=3012] I think we should and I think most of you do.
[time=3017] I think we should be a people who raise our voices and proclaim in our worship.
[time=3023] The great news and the great hope of forgiveness and restoration and being used.
[time=3031] He says, I will declare, you see it there in the text.
[time=3036] He says that my mouth opened my lips, verse 15, that my mouth may declare your praise.
[time=3044] You know what the word declare means?
[time=3048] The literal translation there would be to preach.
[time=3051] And I say, you should preach and you say, ah, no, that's your job.
[time=3057] And I'm saying, no, no, no, no, no.
[time=3061] It's just what we've done with the phrase, your job, your opportunity, forget job, your privilege as a forgiven, restored person who has come face to face with the grace of God who's given you new hope and new life and taken you out from under the destruction and ruin of sin.
[time=3082] Your opportunity, my friends, is to at home.
[time=3084] Your opportunity is at work.
[time=3086] Your opportunity is where you live.
[time=3088] Your opportunity and your calling is to open your mouth and to with great sensitivity and yet with great intentionality declare the goodness.
[time=3100] It says his praise, to declare his praise, the goodness, all that is good and right and true about him.
[time=3107] Well, let me ask you to do this.
[time=3112] If I could, I'm gonna ask Corbin and Tonya to make their way back up.
[time=3117] And I want to give us a chance to respond this morning.
[time=3119] We've got the time to do so.
[time=3121] So I just pray that you'll stay and participate with us in this.
[time=3126] I want to ask you this.
[time=3128] I want to ask if you would just, if you would just stand as a church, I want to be careful how I say this 'cause if you end up sitting, I don't want it to mean anything.
[time=3141] I just, if it's on your heart this morning and I would guess it's most of us.
[time=3147] So it's why I kind of want to just say stand 'cause I know you'd stand.
[time=3151] But I want you to think before you stand.
[time=3153] If it's on your heart this morning to with whatever sin you've been considering, if it's on your heart to make that right, if it's on your heart today, to be one who before God is willing to say forgive me, I smell, restore me, please God, if you can do the flower thing with the ashes, would mean so much to be able to walk with you again in that way and if there would be a chance to use me with my family, with my friends, with my coworkers, if there's any willingness in you at all this morning to pray that prayer, I want to just ask you everybody, just stand right where you are.
[time=3201] Would you do that?
[time=3201] Just stand and it's just a powerful song with such significant lyrics and this Corbin and Tanya sing us through it again here.
[time=3213] They'll give you the chance to kind of sing with them.
[time=3216] Before you sing though, I just want to invite you to pray that prayer.
[time=3219] Forgive me, restore me, use me, and then we'll worship him together and I got a few things I want to say before we go, but let's worship our God as forgiving people together.
[time=3236] (gentle piano music)
[time=3266] [MUSIC - 86 seconds]
[time=3356] - Hey, with your heads bowed and your eyes closed,
[time=3369] maybe just collectively, I know there's a lot going on personally, but as a family, it would just be good for us to declare that prayer one more time.
[time=3378] And would you all just, from the bottom of your hearts, would you just repeat after me?
[time=3383] Would you just say forgive me?
[time=3384] Lord, this is our prayer this morning to you so many of us in need of your forgiveness and so grateful for the blotting out of the washing and the cleansing.
[time=3400] Church, would you just lift your voices to him again?
[time=3405] And would you just say restore me?
[time=3410] God, would you hear our prayer this morning and would you mend what is torn?
[time=3416] Would you build back up what is broken?
[time=3419] Would you bring again a sense of stability and most of all intimacy with you that would allow us to again experience them?
[time=3429] The strong foundation that we sang of earlier, the solid rock.
[time=3434] Oh God, we long for that restoration.
[time=3440] And then oh, church, would you just pray to him?
[time=3444] Would you just cry out?
[time=3445] Just say, use me.
[time=3446] God, you've heard their voices.
[time=3451] Forgive them and restore them and God use them.
[time=3456] Oh, please use this church.
[time=3458] God, use these brothers and sisters.
[time=3460] Use these friends to make much of you in the days to come.
[time=3464] God, to represent you and your truth, to teach transgressors your ways and to convert sinners to the faith.
[time=3474] Oh God, fill our hearts with praise and give us the willingness to preach, to declare what is true and right and good.
[time=3482] And all these forgiven restored people agreed with the prayer and said, amen.
[time=3489] (upbeat music)
