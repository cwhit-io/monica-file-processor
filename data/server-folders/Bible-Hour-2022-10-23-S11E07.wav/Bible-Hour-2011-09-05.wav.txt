[time=493] - Well, hello again, and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=496] It's great to have you with us here on the Bible Hour.
[time=499] My name's Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege, absolute privilege of serving on the team here at Black Hawk Ministries, and we're really thankful to get to spend these few minutes with you before you watch what happened in our service this past week.
[time=514] The service this past week was a phenomenal time together as a family as we celebrated and were reminded of God's great call on our lives
[time=524] to be a people who go.
[time=527] If you know anything about Black Hawk, if you've listened to me over the years, it's a constant theme with us and with me.
[time=534] I want to always be reminding God's people that He has called us not to sit.
[time=539] He has called us as a people not to huddle.
[time=542] We're not to sit back.
[time=544] We're not to retreat.
[time=545] No, God has called His people to actively and with great purpose go.
[time=549] We're to be a mobile people.
[time=551] We are to be on the move with this great message of redemption and hope and forgiveness.
[time=558] And so we spent a whole morning celebrating this idea, talking with people who from our family have gone overseas to the remotest parts of the earth as it says there in Acts 1-8.
[time=569] And then we also want to just take some time and you'll see it.
[time=572] We want to take some time to challenge people and we did.
[time=575] To be goers, to be people who take the message right where you live.
[time=581] The remotest parts of the earth is one thing.
[time=584] Your neighborhood is another, a great opportunity right where you live.
[time=589] Your workplace, your hobbies, your family.
[time=593] It means a lot to God.
[time=595] He has designed you and me, those of us who know and have fully surrendered our hearts and lives to Him.
[time=601] He has called us and designed us to be people who take the message.
[time=605] And I hope this morning is encouraging for you.
[time=608] I hope it reminds you of God's call on your life.
[time=611] And I hope you'll join me in going.
[time=614] Wherever He has us, wherever He sends you, whatever that road looks like, I hope you'll be one who takes the message with you.
[time=622] Hey, I want to invite you to do something.
[time=624] Tonight, as you watch this, it is September 11th and tonight at 6 p.m.
[time=628] If you've never been to Black Hawk or if you've only been a few times, if you watch the broadcast and work kind of your church home tonight at 6 o'clock, I'm hosting a Welcome to Black Hawk reception and I would love for you to come.
[time=642] Tonight, just get in the car, bring your family, come on your own, get some friends, and come be with us right here in the worship center for you.
[time=649] We'll be here at 6 o'clock tonight for a Welcome to Black Hawk.
[time=652] I'd love to meet you.
[time=653] I'd love to tell you my story.
[time=654] I'd love to hear your story.
[time=656] I'd love to help you understand better how you could be a part of this amazing family here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=662] So come and join us tonight at 6.
[time=664] Hey, God bless you. I'm thankful that you tuned and I hope your heart gets encouraged.
[time=668] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=694] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=753] Let's make this next part our prayer this morning.
[time=757] Even if I walk alone, go to this I choose to do.
[time=770] I will not look back how far I'll go out else but you.
[time=781] Even if I walk alone, go to this I choose to do.
[time=791] I will not look back how far I'll go out else but you.
[time=802] See you one more time.
[time=811] Even if I walk alone, go to this I choose to do.
[time=816] I will not look back how far I'll go out else but you.
[time=913] No turning back, no turning back.
[time=922] God in heaven, that's our prayer this morning that we would have ears to hear where you want us to go
[time=929] and that we would have the courage to obey in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=936] Thanks for singing. You may be seated.
[time=939] And greeters, I'll invite you forward at this time to collect ties and offerings.
[time=946] [MUSIC]
[time=959] How merciful the cross, how powerful the blood.
[time=972] How beautiful your arms, open for us, open for us.
[time=984] Lubricated love, God's only son, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, no other name.
[time=1001] Mighty to sing, Jesus, Jesus, my wounds we are here.
[time=1019] And you have conquered the grave.
[time=1026] In your rising we will rise to carry your name above every name.
[time=1039] No breeding love, God's only son, Jesus, Jesus, no other name.
[time=1055] Mighty to sing, Jesus, Jesus, no greater love, God's only son, Jesus, Jesus, no other name.
[time=1082] So strong to say, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, I will carry your name, carry your name.
[time=1102] Jesus, I will carry your name, carry your name.
[time=1130] Jesus, I will carry your name, carry your name, carry your name, carry your name, carry your name.
[time=1158] Let's sing this together.
[time=1163] Lubricated love, God's only son, Jesus, Jesus, no other name.
[time=1181] Mighty to sing, Jesus, Jesus, I will carry your name.
[time=1192] Carry your name, carry your name.
[time=1198] Jesus, your name, forever, for all of my days, in all of my ways.
[time=1212] Jesus, your name, forever.
[time=1236] Everybody was thankful and said, amen, amen, what a great truth church this morning to be reminded of that there were those originally who decided to follow Jesus and in their faithfulness they carried his name and his truth on and their faithfulness to do so.
[time=1256] Allowing us the great privilege of being here today, you've heard already a lot about going today, we have done our best and we will continue here in the time that we have remaining to encourage you with this idea of going.
[time=1271] You hear me talk about it, you hear black talk about it often, we go to enlarge his reach, we know he doesn't need us to enlarge his reach, but we want to help, we want to be a part of his plan.
[time=1285] His kingdom moving forward here and around the world and so we as a people, we tell you all the time, be ready, be prepared, be willing to go.
[time=1295] Now why is this such a priority?
[time=1299] Why would we take a Sunday and make such a big deal about going?
[time=1304] I want to say this to you, I believe, our elders believe, those of us in leadership here at Black Hawk believe with all of our hearts that your spiritual health depends on it.
[time=1317] That's right, we believe your spiritual growth, we believe your spiritual health individually and the health of our ministry absolutely rides on the reality of three things going on in your life that you would and that we would as a family that you would gather.
[time=1333] We think it's absolutely paramount.
[time=1337] Ultimately, a priority in your life in mind that we would gather as a family.
[time=1344] It says in Hebrews that we should not forsake it and so we have said to you and we have taught you and we will continue to remind you that in this place as we try our best with his help to grow disciples, we're committed to gathering as a family on Sunday morning.
[time=1359] We believe that there also needs to be in your life and we want to provide you ways of doing this.
[time=1364] There's a huge commitment in you to connect and we believe in connecting settings in smaller settings than this, whether on a Sunday morning or in a home during the week in a small group, there is a great chance for you to engage in growth.
[time=1380] We hope that and we pray that you would be someone who as a part of this family would gather, who would connect in smaller settings and having gathered and having connected, we want to see you be a people who would go.
[time=1394] We can go to Matthew 28, it says there in Matthew 28, you've heard me say before that Jesus said to those disciples who he was about to leave, he's going to ascend and go back to the Father and he says to them, simply stated, he says go.
[time=1409] He says do not huddle, do not sit back, do not take a passive posture, no with the gospel, with the good news that I have instilled in you with all that you have seen, he said to them go.
[time=1423] And I could take you to Matthew 28, but this morning I'm going to take you to a different verse.
[time=1428] We're going to choose another one, besides Matthew 28, to make the point this morning, I hope it's a point that will encourage you, I hope it's a point that will inspire and motivate you to, along with me and our staff here, be a place who are engaged of people given to going.
[time=1444] Look with me if you would church at Acts chapter 1, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, then comes the book of Acts, look with me at Acts chapter 1, I want to start in verse 4.
[time=1457] An amazing little scene here that I think takes us to verse 8, where we see this idea of going, powerfully depicted.
[time=1466] Stand if you would in honor of God's word, let me read this to you this morning, Acts chapter 1, verses 4 to 8.
[time=1474] Gathering them together, he, this is referring to our Lord Jesus, it says there in verse 4, gathering them together, he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait.
[time=1486] This is after the crucifixion and resurrection, Jesus commands them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised.
[time=1497] Do you know what that is?
[time=1499] What the Father had promised, which Jesus said you heard of from me, for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the, what, say it, Holy Spirit, not many days from now.
[time=1515] So, when they had come together, they were asking him saying, "Lord, is it at this time that you are restoring the kingdom to Israel?"
[time=1526] He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or epochs which the Father has fixed by his own authority, but you, you disciples, you who I'm leaving behind, you who will be here when I am gone."
[time=1543] He says, "You who will receive power, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be my witnesses, both in Jerusalem and in all of Judea and Samaria and even to the remotest part of the earth."
[time=1563] Our Father in heaven, we just pray here in these moments this morning that you would, and your Holy Spirit would, and your Word would remind us today, God, teach us where we need to be taught.
[time=1577] God, I pray that we would see this great purpose that you have left us here on this earth to experience.
[time=1585] So, God, there are so many things in my life and there are so many things in the lives of these people who I love and care for, so many things competing for that place of purpose.
[time=1600] And, O God, I believe in this passage that you give us great clarity on why we're here. And, O God, I pray that you would allow us to see it in your son's name, we pray. Amen.
[time=1613] I want to read to you. You can have a seat. I want to read to you, verse 8 again. He says, "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be my witnesses."
[time=1623] It's interesting when you read through those verses prior to verse 8, they're a little, they're a little transfixed with this idea. They're thinking about like forever.
[time=1633] They want to know if this is the time where it's all going to kind of come to an end. The disciples are wondering if really it's kind of like curtains.
[time=1641] I mean, the kingdom is going to be restored. Everything they've heard about and learned about now is maybe coming to fruition.
[time=1648] Is the king coming? Is this thing almost over? And it's as if Jesus says, "Whoa, whoa, wait. Hold on. There are some things that need to take place. There are some things I have for you.
[time=1661] There is this one thing in particular that I want you to understand. The Spirit of God, Jesus referred to it as the helper in the Gospels.
[time=1671] The Spirit of God is coming and I've got some things for you to do. Number one, I want you to notice here this morning as he talks to them. Listen, as he talks to them, I want you to notice that he's talking to you.
[time=1683] As disciples, as those who have committed to following Jesus Christ, I want you to see two things here in verse 8, "But you will receive power."
[time=1694] "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you." There's a slide there on the screen. I want to read it to you.
[time=1703] They had already seen and experienced the Holy Spirit's saving and miracle-working power. You understand that, right? They had been saved by the work of the Spirit.
[time=1715] They had seen miraculous works of the Spirit. Now what they would experience for the first time was the personal indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1727] Most of you in the room know we've tried to teach you over the years that when today, when you come to faith in Jesus Christ, at that point of surrender, the Spirit of God indwells you.
[time=1739] The Spirit of God indwells you. You are filled up with the Spirit of God, and that is sealed, and that is once and for all. Interesting here, the way this worked in this unique situation that hadn't happened yet.
[time=1754] Here we see the indwelling of the Spirit coming upon the disciples, and that indwelling was going to give them, as you read this verse, that indwelling would give them power. Think about this. Oh, they needed power.
[time=1772] Oh, they would need the power of the Holy Spirit to do the thing that Jesus was telling them they were being left here to do.
[time=1786] Think about the power of the Holy Spirit that would be required for them. The power of the Holy Spirit required for you and I to move with His help, the kingdom of God, forward in and through the darkness.
[time=1801] The kingdom of God. Moving forward, because of this power, this power would provide them determination. The power of the Holy Spirit would provide them courage. The power of the Holy Spirit would provide them boldness.
[time=1816] And in the context of power and Acts 1, 8, we see that it is for the purpose of evangelism. It is for the purpose of sharing their faith. It is for the purpose of going and taking the good news that had been deposited into them and sharing it with those in Jerusalem, in Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest parts of the earth.
[time=1844] They would listen to church. They would desperately need this power of the Holy Spirit because it says there in 1, 8, because they were going to be His what? They were going to be, "You shall be my witnesses," it says.
[time=1862] God's design for the kingdom going forward. God's design for those who followed Him then, and God's design for those who follow Him today. And I want to just say this to you a couple of times and just let it, I hope it will sink in. I hope you'll kind of wrap your arms around this. I hope you'll think about this maybe in a way that you haven't in a while.
[time=1884] But I want to say this to you, God's design for the kingdom moving forward is that it would move forward because of the power He instills in you through the Holy Spirit to be His witness.
[time=1900] You are to be a witness, and I don't know what comes to your mind when you hear that. Maybe you think about door knocking. Maybe you think about a guy on a street corner with a bullhorn. I don't know.
[time=1914] Take all that out of your mind, and I want to just help you understand this morning what it meant in this context. But make no mistake, God's Word is reminding you and me, anyone who names the name of Christ,
[time=1928] that His design for the kingdom going forward is that it goes forward through a powerful, spirit-induced, powerful witness. And you are the witness. What's a witness?
[time=1946] What is a witness? Two things I want you to learn this morning about the phrase, that phrase used here in this context. Number one, a witness will think with me. Do you promise to tell the whole and nothing but the witness tells the what?
[time=1970] Say it louder. A witness tells the what? Truth. Absolutely. That's why you go on a witness stand. You go on a witness stand, and there you speak the truth about whatever case you're being asked to speak into. In this case, Jesus' witnesses told the truth about Him.
[time=1994] They told the truth in the words. They spoke. They told the truth about Him in the way they lived. They told the truth about Jesus and their values. They told the truth in the way they conducted themselves. Witnesses tell the truth about Jesus, something for you to think about.
[time=2013] This morning, like them, you get the opportunity, each and every day, my friends, to tell the truth about Jesus. Do your actions, do your words, do your values, do your choices, communicate that He saves, that He redeems, that He forgives.
[time=2037] What's your witness? Hear the kingdom of God goes forward because of the faithful witness of those who had decided to follow Jesus. Second thing I want you to see about a witness is that a witness, according to the Greek word itself, you can look this up, the meaning of the word in the Greek is one who dies for His faith.
[time=2062] This gives great insight, Church, to the level at which they were willing to tell the truth about Him. They were willing to tell the truth about Jesus even if it meant their lives.
[time=2076] And they lived in the reality of a day where it oftentimes did. It oftentimes cost them their lives to tell the truth about Jesus, but they told the truth about Him because they had decided to follow Him.
[time=2091] And it is a great picture for you and a great picture for me as we think about our opportunity to be a witness empowered by the Holy Spirit. What does the text say?
[time=2104] In our Judea, in our Samaria, and in our or your remotest parts of the earth. I want to talk to you a little bit this morning here about your Judea. You see it there in the text. If I had a big board, I would just draw, I draw a little circle.
[time=2121] I draw a little bit bigger circle, and then I draw a really big circle, and this is exactly how the kingdom moves forward according to Acts 1-8. And listen, it begins with the witnessing, and I'm going to use that word now, not based on door knocking or bull horns.
[time=2138] And I use that word now just based upon you and I being willing to, with great determination and devotion, you can even kill me for it, telling the truth about Jesus in each and every opportunity He would give you. So the truth about witnessing is that it begins for you and for me at home.
[time=2156] It begins for you and for me, listen, in Jerusalem. It begins for you and for me right where you live.
[time=2168] A lot of people come to me all the time and say, "Hey, I want to be a missionary. I want to go and spread the gospel across the world." And it's always good to first talk with them about how it's going in their efforts to spread the gospel on their block at their work.
[time=2185] This is where it begins. It begins in your workplace. It begins in your neighborhood. It begins in your own family. It begins with your readiness and your willingness to write where God has you. Think about that. Where does God have you? Where do you live?
[time=2204] Where do you work? Who are your friends? What hobbies do you have? Where you get to interact with others? This is the place where witness begins and sometimes it is a very, very challenging endeavor.
[time=2219] The guys are going to come. I just want you to listen. I just want you to watch. I just want you to enjoy this. Sometimes for you and for me, this idea of witness right where we live can be a very, very challenging, sometimes discouraging thing.
[time=2236] It's also very important. So watch and see if we can't learn some things here this morning.
[time=2243] Just waiting on my buddy here, my neighbor, Dave. He had a phone call from his attorney or something. I hope everything's okay. He's kind of funny. He's going through this stuff right now. He just moved in here a few months ago.
[time=2261] He keeps coming out and talking with me. I'm not much of a talker, really. In fact, I know maybe three people on the entire street.
[time=2271] I don't even know their names. My wife and I, we came up with nicknames for them. That way we knew who we were talking about.
[time=2278] Across the street here, that's Red Door. Then over here, there's Crazy Dog. I don't have to explain that one.
[time=2285] Over here, there's Bill Rick. A funny story. When he moved in, I thought his name was Bill and I called him Bill.
[time=2295] About six months later, I found out his name was really Rick. So that was fun. I don't really talk to my neighbors.
[time=2303] They don't talk to me. I like it that way. That's the way it's been for a long time.
[time=2309] Then, Chaddie Kathy over here moves in and ruins everything. That sounds bad. I'm sorry.
[time=2318] I don't mean to say mean things like that, but he's a nice guy. He really is a nice guy.
[time=2323] He's just going through some tough stuff right now. He needs Jesus.
[time=2333] But how do you even bring it up? What do you say? It's such a tough conversation.
[time=2342] What do you say? Sorry about that. Hey, no problem. No problem. Is everything okay?
[time=2347] Yeah, it will be. It's just ex-wife stuff. It can be kind of crazy stuff.
[time=2351] Sure. Sure. Yeah. That's a tough thing. I was just thinking just a moment ago.
[time=2359] I just spit it out, right? I was just, I hope I don't offend you.
[time=2369] But I see you're going through some stuff and I've been through some stuff.
[time=2375] And God really helped me through it. And I think that he might be able to help you too.
[time=2386] So, God from the Bible? Yeah, God can help me. How dare you?
[time=2395] No, seriously. How dare you stand there and judge me?
[time=2399] Seriously, who do you think you are? No, no. I mean, what is all this? I mean, you must be crazy.
[time=2404] Are you crazy? No, no, no. You got your little magic book telling you how to save the world, right?
[time=2408] And say like, oh, look, right here says, oh, let's save Dave, right? Is that what it is?
[time=2412] Is that what this is all about? No, no. Listen to me. If you ever talk to me about God again, so help me, God, I will punch you in the face. So it's probably not going to happen like that, really.
[time=2425] But, you know, I don't know, you know, I really don't know Dave that well.
[time=2432] And, you know, I don't know what he would say. I don't know what he would do.
[time=2438] And, you know, I just keep thinking about it in my head and going over it.
[time=2442] There's just a thousand ways this could just go so wrong, you know?
[time=2447] And, you know, I don't want to come across as this like super Christian, you know?
[time=2453] This faith man, Bible boy, you know, just wearing Christian t-shirts and cram a God on everybody's throat.
[time=2458] You know, I don't want to be that guy. That doesn't help anybody.
[time=2462] Hey, man, sorry about that.
[time=2464] No problem. Is everything okay? Yeah, you know, it will be. It's just ex-wife stuff.
[time=2468] Oh, yeah. It's kind of crazy sometimes, but, you know, that's pretty tough.
[time=2472] Yeah. You know what, though? I've got a friend.
[time=2476] Well, you know, actually, I'm okay. I've got a really good lawyer.
[time=2480] Oh, no, no, no. He's, uh, he's no lawyer. No, he's, uh, he's actually a Jewish carpenter.
[time=2488] Okay. And, uh, he's my co-pilot. And, uh, I'd like to introduce him to you sometime.
[time=2493] Would, uh, would you be willing to break bread with me?
[time=2497] What is this, man? Are you okay? I mean, is there anything okay?
[time=2501] Are you right? Are you okay? Am I okay?
[time=2503] Yeah. Am I okay?
[time=2505] Well, yeah. Brother, I've been washing the blood.
[time=2508] I am lost in his love.
[time=2512] I am forgiven and freed. I'm of Abraham's seed, and I'm living my best life now.
[time=2518] I am dressed in his best. Say what?
[time=2522] I am dressed in his best. Two blessed, two beat oppressed.
[time=2526] And I am exalted and, uh, highly favored. Get a get name, man. Oh, whoa, whoa, man, whoa.
[time=2534] Yeah, so I definitely don't want to be that guy.
[time=2538] That'd be bad. That'd be bad.
[time=2542] I, so I just keep going over this scenario again and again in my mind.
[time=2547] Like, how do I, how do I bring it up? How do I talk to him about it?
[time=2551] You know, and I just, every time I think about it, I just start to get nervous, and I just lose my appetite and I start to get sweaty.
[time=2558] And I just, I just see all the, all the ways that, that's going wrong.
[time=2562] Or could go wrong, you know? But, but maybe then again, I'm, I'm just being a little too negative.
[time=2569] You know, maybe, maybe David would be open to this.
[time=2573] Maybe he's ready to accept Christ as a savior and it's just waiting for me to initiate the conversation.
[time=2578] Hey man, sorry about all that. Hey, hey, no problem. Is, is everything okay?
[time=2582] You know, it will be, it's just, uh, ex-wife stuff. It gets kind of crazy.
[time=2585] Oh yeah, sure, sure. Yeah. I mean, if there's, if there's anything I can do, you know, stop.
[time=2591] There's something about you. I don't know what it is, but I want it.
[time=2596] You know, I, I can't explain it. You, you're just always smiling, man.
[time=2600] You're always so happy. I mean, I want that.
[time=2603] You know, I mean, you have like, there's this tangible aura around you, you know?
[time=2608] Cool. I mean, look at you. You're, you're glowing, really.
[time=2611] Thanks. I know it's, you know, I, I want that. I, I need that.
[time=2616] Can, can you, can you lead me to Christ? I'm, I just show me how I'm, I'm here.
[time=2623] I'll say the prayer. I'm ready.
[time=2626] Yeah, that's not going to happen.
[time=2631] You know, I, again, I just keep thinking about how this could just go so wrong.
[time=2640] You know, what if I say something that's, that's not even in the Bible?
[time=2643] What if I say something that's just completely off base, you know?
[time=2646] He's going to go tell the neighbors. They're going to tell their kids, oh, stay away from the crazy Christian guy.
[time=2651] You know, can't have that happen either, you know?
[time=2656] What if, what if I just don't say anything?
[time=2660] What if, what if I just keep waiting for tomorrow to happen?
[time=2664] Maybe it'll be better. Maybe it'll be easier. I don't know.
[time=2668] Is, is that really a good alternative? You know, what if, what if I don't say anything, then what?
[time=2676] You know, here's, here's a guy who lives right next to me and he keeps coming over and talking to me.
[time=2681] And like, he's going through all this tough stuff and is basically giving me an open door.
[time=2686] And what, I'm not going to walk through it.
[time=2689] You know, what if, what if David needs me?
[time=2695] What if David's counting on me?
[time=2699] Really, really well done and very honest and I think very insightful.
[time=2705] And I want to just say this to you. I want to actually, I want to read this to you.
[time=2710] First Peter can turn there in your Bibles, but with what you just saw, fresh on your mind.
[time=2715] I want to read you what it says in 1 Peter 3 15.
[time=2719] It says there, my friends, it says, "But sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts."
[time=2725] Go ahead, turn there. 1 Peter 3 15 talking about really our witness and our opportunity with those in our world.
[time=2734] It says, "But sanctify," which means to set apart Christ as Lord in your hearts.
[time=2741] Always being ready to make a defense. Don't get too confused by that word.
[time=2748] It's not so much an argument. It's more of an explanation.
[time=2752] Be ready, it says, to make a defense, to explain to everyone who, don't miss this, who what, who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence.
[time=2769] I want to just show you two things here about what we just saw.
[time=2772] Number one, he was talking there at the end about just being fearful, like many of you are, and like I am, that in those situations you might say the wrong thing.
[time=2782] He was talking about how in these situations there's this nervousness that he feels that when he gets in that situation, what if he doesn't communicate well?
[time=2791] What if he doesn't really know how to answer a question and hear me? Not that it's about always having an answer, not that it's about always saying the right thing, but I want you to see this.
[time=2804] This is why we say gather, connect, and go, because when you gather, when you make it an enormous priority to be here and be under the teaching of God's Word, when the Word of God and the truth about God and the truth about salvation gets taught to you and you take that in faithfully, you begin to grow.
[time=2825] When you go into smaller settings, an A/B/F on a Sunday morning, a small group during the week, an accountability group of other women or other men or other students, you grow in your faith.
[time=2836] The truth about God and his Word gets even further explained and understood, and now as you give yourself to this process, now you're going and know you're not perfect, but if you've been faithful to these things, you find yourself in a situation where you very well may be able
[time=2854] to explain the hope that is in you. Listen to this too. We could go on and on about this just real quickly.
[time=2865] Obviously, he did it poorly in some ways, and that was the point of the drama. I hope you'll just remember these things as it relates to whoever that guy is in your world.
[time=2879] Who is that guy, by the way, in your world? I hope you'd at least put a face right now to that scenario in your life.
[time=2892] Who is that guy in your world? And as it relates to whoever that person is in your world, let me just give you some things to think about that.
[time=2901] I hope we'll put your heart and mind at ease. These are just good, wise things to understand. Number one, be kind.
[time=2908] Number one, whether it's at work or whether it's in the neighborhood or wherever it might be, one of the things out of the gate that helps this go well is when you evidence to that person, the kindness of the Lord.
[time=2919] When you evidence to that person or to that family or to that couple, the graciousness that you're able to express because of the work of God in you.
[time=2931] Listen, be kind. It's not rocket science. You can do it. You can be gracious. Secondly, I wrote down, serve them.
[time=2942] Think of ways that you can meet a need. Look for opportunities to go across the yard. Look for opportunities to walk across the street.
[time=2951] Look for a chance that I believe God will give you to serve them.
[time=2957] To show them your unconditional, kind, gracious willingness to meet a need that they may have. No strings attached.
[time=2967] Be kind and be willing to serve and understand that if you'll do those two things now you have made in this culture, in this day, now you have made an incredible impact.
[time=2978] Now, the recipients of unconditional kindness and service are looking at you going, wow, what is the deal with them?
[time=2988] And so I would say to you thirdly, then be available. Be available on the driveway. Be available in the backyard.
[time=2996] Be available wherever it is that you go. Whatever context we're talking about, would you be willing to having been gracious and kind, having served them?
[time=3007] Would you be willing to slow down, not be in a hurry and be available to what God might want to do, a circumstance, a situation he might orchestrate for you to be able to see this thing go maybe just a step or two further.
[time=3024] Fourthly, I wrote down, when that opportunity comes, when you find yourself there in that setting, I hope that you'll resist the temptation that many of us, I know, fall into,
[time=3035] which is there they are, there you are, and you just begin to spew on them all the answers to questions they haven't asked.
[time=3047] Just listen, just ask a question or two and allow them the privilege of telling you their story.
[time=3056] Find out more about them, find out about their family, find out about their likes and dislikes, find out about their job, find out about their past, find out about their dreams, just ask a ton of questions and then just listen.
[time=3072] I love how Jesus did this with the woman at the well, I love how he allowed her to tell him her story, yes he already knew it, but having given her the opportunity to tell her story, he then connects her story with his, and that's the great opportunity you and I have.
[time=3090] Be kind, serve, be available, ask questions and listen, and then be willing to share your story.
[time=3097] I hope you'll write that down, having heard their story, it gives you the chance to, maybe not all of your story, maybe it's just a part of your story, but when they begin to talk and you begin to listen, it then gives you the great privileged opportunity of speaking back and sharing with them.
[time=3115] First Peter 3.15, the hope that is within you.
[time=3119] Again, if they ask, I certainly hope you would be willing to speak.
[time=3124] Last thing on that is this, pray.
[time=3127] I wonder how often you do that.
[time=3129] I wonder how often as you look at this scenario, we just saw played out here and whoever that guy is for you, I wonder how often you are on your knees.
[time=3139] I wonder how frequently your family is on theirs, praying for and asking God to give you opportunity to graciously, humbly, lovingly, live out your faith, build a friendship, and maybe see redemptive things happen.
[time=3157] Give it some thought.
[time=3159] Well, that's your Judea. There is your Samaria. There is our Samaria. If I were back on that big board, I would just kind of show you how the idea of Samaria was the region around Jerusalem.
[time=3172] And there are opportunities God has given us in the past.
[time=3175] I believe there will be opportunities in the future for you to join us as we go to places, not in Fort Wayne.
[time=3183] Around our region, around our country, we want to be a people who are willing and ready to be mobile with the hope that is within us.
[time=3191] And then there is your remotest parts of the earth.
[time=3195] And we're going to keep going. I think we'll probably go back to Serbia.
[time=3199] I know probably in the spring we'll go back to Nairobi, Kenya.
[time=3204] I think you see pictures there of Kenya, Kenya is a place that God has put on my heart.
[time=3209] He has put it on the heart of our church. It was about five, six years ago that we first went.
[time=3214] We learned then and we continued to just be heartbroken by the reality that in Kenya, 300 babies a day are thrown away.
[time=3224] 300 newborns each day are thrown into sewer ditches and out into the bush.
[time=3229] 300 little ones a day thrown away due to abject poverty and the HIV virus.
[time=3236] And God's given us as a church this great opportunity.
[time=3239] We just keep sending teams, team after team after team, to help at New Life Home Trust at the orphanage there.
[time=3246] To care for these little ones, to hold them, to feed them, to play with them as they grow older.
[time=3252] Now toddlers are becoming young boys and young girls and now they're becoming 12 and 13 year olds.
[time=3258] And the situation for them is as dire as it's ever been.
[time=3261] And so now we're challenged with new ways to go and help and provide encouragement and support.
[time=3268] And we're going to just keep going. One of the ways we do this, one of the things that God has provided,
[time=3277] Blackhawk, that has allowed us to go across the street and across the world is our going fund.
[time=3284] And I emailed you about this this week and I hope this morning as we leave there are going to be greeters at the doors with buckets.
[time=3292] The bucket says we leave that represents an alms offering, alms offerings are for those in need.
[time=3297] And what we're going to do is ask you as a family today to please make a contribution on your way out
[time=3303] so that we can continue to supplement short-term trips to the remotest parts of the earth.
[time=3308] Short-term trips to our Samaria. Mission witness opportunities right here in our own backyard.
[time=3316] And at one point that going fund was about $25,000.
[time=3320] It's kind of over the last several years whittled its way down to just a few thousand and we want to see that bumped up in the days to come so we can keep going so that we can.
[time=3331] Corbin, would you come on up so that we can, those of us who have decided to follow Jesus
[time=3337] so that we can have a witness empowered by the Holy Spirit?
[time=3341] And my hope and prayer is that your witness and mine would continue to be powerful and meaningful
[time=3348] and relevant in this world that God has placed us in.
[time=3352] I am deciding to follow Jesus. I am deciding to follow Jesus. I am deciding to follow Jesus.
[time=3369] No turning back. No turning back. Though none go with me, still I will follow. Though none go with me, still I will follow.
[time=3387] No no no with me, still I will follow. No turning back. No turning back.
[time=3398] Where you leave me, I will follow. Where you leave me, I will go. Where you leave me, I will follow.
[time=3433] Let's make this next part our prayer this morning.
[time=3439] Even if I walk alone, go to this I choose to do.
[time=3450] I will not look back, how far I'll go and else but you.
[time=3461] Even if I walk alone, go to this I choose to do.
[time=3472] I will not look back, how far I'll go and else but you. See you one more time.
[time=3484] Even if I walk alone, go to this I choose to do.
[time=3495] I will not look back, how far I'll go and else but you.
[time=3507] Where you leave me, I will follow. Where you leave me, I will go. Where you leave me, I will follow.
