[time=391] Your reign and matchless name all my days, all my days, so that my whole life be a place you offer me, a life that shouts and sings the greatness of our King, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God forever.
[time=420] Glory to God, glory to God, glory to God forever.
[time=432] Take my life and let it be, all for you, and for your glory, take my life and let it be yours.
[time=454] Take glory to God, glory to God forever.
[time=466] Glory to God, glory to God, glory to God forever.
[time=489] Glory to God, glory to God forever.
[time=501] Take my life and let it be, all for you, and for your glory, take my life and let it be yours.
[time=524] Glory to God, glory to God forever.
[time=537] Amen, you believe that?
[time=541] Amen, glory to God.
[time=545] Well, hey, everybody, I'm Chris, and Corbin called me last night sick, so he asked me to cover for him.
[time=551] So say a little prayer for him if you think about it.
[time=553] I think he's going to be all right, but just not able to be here this morning.
[time=557] So, well, hey, let's continue worshiping.
[time=560] And if you feel led to stand, stand if you feel led to sit, sit, whatever way you respond to God, let's do that this morning.
[time=568] Let's be faithful in response to God.
[time=570] And let's sing about the victory that he's given us this morning.
[time=573] Are you excited?
[time=574] Are you happy?
[time=575] Are you blessed about having the victory through Jesus Christ?
[time=577] [AMEN] Well, let's sing it.
[time=609] I heard an old old story.
[time=612] How a Savior came from glory.
[time=615] Now he gave his life on Calvary to save a wretch like me.
[time=622] I heard a loud is from me of his precious bloods of Tony.
[time=629] And I remented of my sin.
[time=632] I'm one of victory.
[time=637] Oh, victory of Jesus.
[time=640] I say go forever.
[time=643] You saw me above you.
[time=646] With his redeeming blood.
[time=649] In love here under you.
[time=652] And all my love is through you.
[time=656] To victory, we mean the cleansing blood.
[time=663] I heard a loud is healing of his cleansing power, revealing how he made the lame to walk again.
[time=677] And cause the light to see.
[time=680] And then I cried dear Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit.
[time=687] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory.
[time=693] Oh, victory in Jesus.
[time=696] I say go forever.
[time=700] You saw me above you.
[time=703] With his redeeming blood.
[time=706] In love here under you.
[time=709] And all my love is through you.
[time=713] To victory, we mean the cleansing blood.
[time=736] [MUSIC]
[time=759] I heard a bad old mansion.
[time=762] He is built for me in glory.
[time=765] And I heard about the streets of gold beyond the crystal sea.
[time=772] About the angels singing.
[time=775] The home redemption story.
[time=778] And some sweet days I sing up through the song.
[time=783] Oh, victory in Jesus.
[time=790] I say go forever.
[time=793] You saw me above you.
[time=797] With his redeeming blood.
[time=800] In love here under you.
[time=803] And all my love is through you.
[time=807] To victory, we mean the cleansing blood.
[time=813] In love here under you.
[time=822] I say go forever.
[time=826] In love here under you.
[time=829] And all my love is through you.
[time=833] To victory, we mean the cleansing blood.
[time=840] [APPLAUSE - 11 seconds]
[time=858] [MUSIC]

[time=879] This is a real privilege for us every week to get to connect with you and share with you, those of you in our viewing audience, what's going on here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=887] I want to tell you about an opportunity coming up here in the days to come that I think will really be of value to you.
[time=894] At Black Hawk, there is a deep commitment to spiritual growth.

[time=914] seven or eight classes that really can help you grow.
[time=918] It really can stretch your faith and equip you in your relationship with the Lord.
[time=923] And I want to make sure that you know that's available to everybody.
[time=927] You may not be here on Sunday mornings, but you could be here on Thursday nights.
[time=930] And these classes will help you.
[time=932] They will really challenge you.
[time=934] And there are classes available for people all across the spiritual growth continuum.
[time=940] There's beginning classes for those new to the faith.
[time=944] There are classes kind of at the other end that will stretch you and your understanding of teaching the scriptures or doctrine and everything in between.
[time=953] Tremendous staff of people who will be leading these classes.
[time=957] And you can go to our website at blackhawkministries.org and go to the Grow Groups icon and click on that thing.

[time=970] But know how much it means to us to be able to connect with you not only on Sunday mornings here, but also during the week.
[time=978] We'd love to have you come.
[time=979] So think about it.
[time=980] Come and grow with us in October, and we'll hope to see you then.
[time=997] And that thou miss me come to the o'er end of God I come.

[time=1026] Tremendous staff of people who will be leading this class.
[time=1033] And that thou miss me come to the end of God.
[time=1261] [MUSIC]
[time=1271] Well, we begin this morning a three-week discussion, study, series, whatever you want to call it.
[time=1277] We have been asking the question and we come to it this morning.
[time=1280] Are all sins the same?
[time=1284] I want you to think about this with me today.
[time=1286] Are all sins the same, are they?
[time=1290] As sins go, is greed the same or just as bad as murder?
[time=1299] Is gossip just as bad, just as sinful as adultery?
[time=1305] Gluttony and homosexuality.
[time=1309] Are they the same in God's eyes?
[time=1311] Which is worse, jealousy, coveting something or stealing it?
[time=1318] Lust or hurtful words, which one may be more offensive in the grander scheme of things.
[time=1326] It's been interesting hearing some of the feedback over the past few weeks.
[time=1331] I've been asking people to respond to the question, are all sins the same?
[time=1336] One guy talked to said this, he said no way.
[time=1339] He said they're just not the same.
[time=1341] Some sins are just worse than others.
[time=1345] Like I know, I'm not supposed to covet my neighbor's car or house or wife.
[time=1350] That's a sin.
[time=1351] It's not good, I know.
[time=1353] But if I go next door and kill my neighbor so I can have his car, I'm sorry that's worse.
[time=1360] Two separate sins, he said, definitely not the same.
[time=1364] Another person I talked to said sure they are.
[time=1367] All sins are the same.
[time=1369] Sin is sin.
[time=1371] If God declares an act, an attitude or a thought, I liked the way this person said that.
[time=1378] You'll hear me use that phrase throughout our discussion.
[time=1382] They said if God declares an act, an attitude or a thought to be sinful, regardless of size or scope, then it's fully sin.
[time=1392] One new believer.
[time=1394] Maybe just in the last couple of months, they've come to faith in Christ and they asked me, they said, Kelly, does the Bible create levels of sins?
[time=1403] Does it say some sins are more offensive to God than others?
[time=1410] Are all sins the same?
[time=1415] One person asked a great question.
[time=1418] They said, I have no idea if all sins are the same.
[time=1421] But the question I have for you is this, they said, who determines what sin is?
[time=1429] Which I thought was a great reminder.
[time=1433] I thought it was a great reminder to me and I thought we should probably do some work here to set some kind of a context for our discussion and our times together over these next few weeks.
[time=1444] Here you go, three things to help set some context for this discussion, three things I want you to understand and see clearly as we begin this discussion.
[time=1453] Number one, first of all, we believe that sin is defined by God and God alone.
[time=1459] Please write that down, please understand this is at the core of our understanding of sin.
[time=1465] We believe that sin is defined or determined by God and God alone.
[time=1471] He has spoken. Look with me at Psalm 119.
[time=1475] It says in Psalm 1191, it says in Psalm 1191, how blessed are those whose way is blameless who walk in the law of the Lord.
[time=1488] The Lord, we believe God has spoken.
[time=1491] We believe He has given us decrees.
[time=1493] We believe He has set out before us what He wants us to know, what He wants us to see in His Word in His truth.
[time=1502] It goes on in verse 4 to say, you have ordained your precepts that we should keep them diligently.
[time=1509] In verse 9, how can a young man keep his way pure by keeping it according to your word?
[time=1516] God has spoken. God has decreed.
[time=1519] God has established His perfect will in the Word of God.
[time=1525] Verse 11, your Word, I have treasured in my heart that I may not say it.
[time=1531] Sin against you.
[time=1534] When we speak of sin here at Black Hawk, we're referring to actions, attitudes, and thoughts that God has classified,
[time=1544] that God has defined as sinful.
[time=1548] I had an ant growing up that we would visit periodically.
[time=1554] Didn't see much of this ant, but every time I would go and visit this ant, it was a little confusing to me.
[time=1562] She was extremely conservative in her spirituality and her view of things, and it was hard for me as a 9, 10, 11-year-old,
[time=1573] because in her world playing cards, co-ed swimming, hair over the ears, TV dancing, pants on girls,
[time=1583] movies, it was all sinful.
[time=1588] And in her world it wasn't just sinful, it was horrendous.
[time=1594] It was sinful, as defined by her.
[time=1602] And I want to just remind you this morning that it never is a good thing when you start defining what sin is,
[time=1612] when the fact of the matter is we believe God has defined what sin is.
[time=1618] And you may wish there were more definition, you may wish there were less, but the fact of the matter is God has defined
[time=1626] what he views as right and wrong, and his definition trumps my ants, praise God.
[time=1635] And his definition trumps yours, his definition trumped the Pharisees.
[time=1640] Oh, my friends, when you start defining what sin is, it turns you into a legalist.
[time=1647] It turns you into one who takes what God has said and moves it to places he never intended it to go.
[time=1654] We believe that God and God alone define sin, amen?
[time=1658] Number two, we believe that everything God wants us to know and understand about the choices we should make
[time=1665] has been recorded and kept for us in the Scriptures.
[time=1669] God's Word has always been and always will be our absolute authority on everything pertaining to life and godliness,
[time=1679] including what's sinful and what's not.
[time=1683] And while it may go without say for some, I don't want to neglect this.
[time=1687] I think we should mention that any discussion about sin implies a wrong and a right with me.
[time=1698] Any discussion about sin implies a wrong and a right, and we believe, I believe at the core of my being,
[time=1705] that the God revealed to us in Scripture, and everything about him, his character, his decrees, his ways,
[time=1714] what he has said, what he hasn't, we believe the God revealed to us in the Bible is right.
[time=1720] And anything, anything that would stand or be in contrast to him and what he has revealed is wrong.
[time=1737] Thirdly, we believe he is our, this is big, in any discussion on sin, he is our authority.
[time=1744] We believe that. We are a people who have submitted ourselves and our lives to his rule and his reign.
[time=1751] He is God.
[time=1754] We believe that he is our authority and that he perfectly establishes for us in every arena of life the parameters and boundaries.
[time=1762] I hope you'll hang on to that idea.
[time=1764] The parameters and boundaries needed to avoid what?
[time=1768] Say it, Church, sin. And in the process, experience his blessing.
[time=1774] He has made this clear, my friends, from the very beginning.
[time=1777] He makes it as clear to us today as he did back in Deuteronomy
[time=1783] when he was dealing initially with his people, who he longed for them, the people of Israel.
[time=1789] He wanted so desperately for them to abide by what he had prescribed.
[time=1794] He wanted them to live within the parameters and boundaries he had established.
[time=1800] And it says in Deuteronomy 7, Deuteronomy 7, I'm going to start reading in verse 9,
[time=1807] "Know therefore that the Lord your God, he is God." I don't think this will be on the screen, so if you want to turn there, you can.
[time=1815] Deuteronomy 7, 9, Moses speaking to the people of God, passing on to them what God has said,
[time=1822] "Know therefore that the Lord your God, he is God, the faithful God, who keeps his covenant and his loving kindness to a thousandth generation
[time=1833] with those who love him and keep his commandments." But repays those who hate him to their faces, to destroy them.
[time=1843] He will not delay with him who hates him.
[time=1846] He will repay him to his face, therefore you.
[time=1851] "Shall keep the commandment and the statutes and the judgments." There's the parameters and there's the boundaries which I am commanding you today to do them.
[time=1862] Then it says in verse 12 that it shall come about because you listen to these judgments and keep and do them that the Lord your God will keep with you his covenant
[time=1874] and his loving kindness which he swore to your forefathers.
[time=1878] He will love you and bless you and multiply you.
[time=1884] He has established parameters and boundaries.
[time=1888] God has spoken and when you and I are willing to function within those, we have the joy of following him and we experience his blessing and his love and his provision.
[time=1900] So let's start this morning.
[time=1903] In our discussion of our all sins the same by looking specifically at the biblical idea of sin first.
[time=1912] I want to show you three words that are used throughout Scripture to define for us,
[time=1918] to show for us the effect of the meaning of sin.
[time=1922] Three common expressions in the Scripture.
[time=1925] Sin, transgression and iniquity.
[time=1930] Let's start with sin.
[time=1932] The word for the Greek word for sin, it's used many times in the New Testament, especially Greek word for sin is hamartia.
[time=1940] Hamartia and it means this.
[time=1942] It means to miss the mark, to fall short of God's requirement.
[time=1949] And I would just have you write if you were writing in parentheses there at the end, write down any requirement.
[time=1957] Write down all requirements.
[time=1961] Sin, hamartia is to miss the mark, to fall short of God's requirement.
[time=1968] Romans 3.23 says for all have what?
[time=1971] Sinned and fallen short.
[time=1974] There's hamartia right there.
[time=1976] For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, the requirement of God.
[time=1981] I think it says in Romans 6, Romans 6.1, what shall we say then?
[time=1986] Are we to continue in hamartia?
[time=1988] Should we just keep missing the mark?
[time=1990] So that grace may increase, may it never be.
[time=1994] People understand this.
[time=1995] Hamartia, missing the mark.
[time=1997] Matt Hicks, come and help me with this just real quick.
[time=2000] I'm not going to embarrass you at all.
[time=2002] All you got to do is kind of just stand still.
[time=2004] This is a good friend of mine.
[time=2005] Matt Hicks, everybody say hello to Matt.
[time=2007] Welcome him on stage.
[time=2010] Come on, buddy.
[time=2011] All right, Matt, I want you to stand.
[time=2013] Hey, good to see you.
[time=2014] I want you to stand right here.
[time=2015] And you can just kind of face me.
[time=2016] Matt is, for the purpose of this illustration, Matt is, turn a little bit this way.
[time=2021] There you go.
[time=2022] Matt is God's design for how everything should be.
[time=2026] His family's laughing right now.
[time=2029] But that's all right.
[time=2030] Matt is our picture of perfection.
[time=2034] Whatever, listen, whatever the deal, how you should talk, how you should eat, how you should
[time=2045] love your wife, how you should respect your husband.
[time=2048] How you should talk about people are not behind their backs.
[time=2051] What you should think about in those private places in your mind.
[time=2056] Every arena of your life where God has spoken and created for us parameters and boundaries.
[time=2064] This is the target.
[time=2067] This is how it should go.
[time=2069] This is obedience right here.
[time=2071] Okay, so what I want you to do is just want you to kind of hold your hands like this.
[time=2074] All right, and here's the deal.
[time=2076] You have to understand, I think it's really good for us to understand, hamartia.
[time=2081] Because hamartia is missing the mark.
[time=2084] A lot of you think sometimes that hamartia missing the mark is when you're just kind of
[time=2092] not really kind of paying attention and you're kind of lost in some other place.
[time=2097] And there's this thing over here that you know God's called you to and you just kind of missed the mark.
[time=2104] Oops.
[time=2107] Sometimes it's that, but you know what?
[time=2110] Sometimes it's not that.
[time=2112] Sometimes you know that, again, pick your arena.
[time=2116] You know what God has said.
[time=2118] And sometimes you want to, you want to, you want to do it.
[time=2123] I mean, you try to do it.
[time=2125] And sometimes even with your best effort you just sort of miss the mark.
[time=2130] The mark.
[time=2132] It's sin.
[time=2135] It's a violation of God and His perfect law for you in that moment.
[time=2141] Sometimes you're not messing around.
[time=2144] Sometimes you're not really trying hard.
[time=2146] You know what?
[time=2147] Sometimes you do.
[time=2148] And sometimes I do.
[time=2150] Sometimes you just don't even try.
[time=2159] Sometimes you just, you don't even make an effort.
[time=2165] Sin.
[time=2168] Careless.
[time=2169] Sin.
[time=2170] Trying.
[time=2172] Sin.
[time=2173] Not even trying.
[time=2175] Sin.
[time=2176] God has spoken to you in every arena of your life.
[time=2179] He has established for you at home.
[time=2183] He has established for you in the quiet recesses of your mind.
[time=2186] He has established for you at the computer.
[time=2189] He has established for you at school.
[time=2191] How he wants you to live.
[time=2193] He's given you that target and he wants you to hit the mark.
[time=2198] And when you don't, sometimes, there you go.
[time=2201] You do.
[time=2203] Whole bunch of times we don't.
[time=2205] And when you don't, it's sin.
[time=2209] Give Matt Hicks a big hand.
[time=2212] Thank you very much, Matt.
[time=2214] Don't worry about picking up those balls.
[time=2216] Don't throw them back at me.
[time=2218] Just walk right past them.
[time=2220] Avoid the temptation to sin.
[time=2224] Hurting your pastor.
[time=2225] Hamartia.
[time=2228] Sin.
[time=2230] Transgression.
[time=2231] Write this down.
[time=2232] Transgression.
[time=2233] Parabasus is the Greek word.
[time=2237] Transgression.
[time=2238] And it means this to step or go over a clearly established what?
[time=2243] Say it.
[time=2244] Line.
[time=2246] God has established, we believe, parameters and boundaries.
[time=2249] We've already said this.
[time=2250] Transgression is when you make a choice.
[time=2253] It's when you or I go in a certain direction.
[time=2257] And we commit sin by stepping over a line that God has clearly established for you and for me in our lives.
[time=2265] That line more than likely has been established for us in his what? In his word.
[time=2272] In God's word.
[time=2273] And God's spirit is there to help you and I stay away from those, what?
[time=2279] Those lines.
[time=2281] And when you or I step over those lines, the spirit of God brings what?
[time=2287] Conviction.
[time=2288] You've felt that.
[time=2290] I shouldn't.
[time=2292] I shouldn't be here.
[time=2294] I've stepped over this line.
[time=2296] This is the idea, my friends.
[time=2297] This is the word.
[time=2298] Transgression.
[time=2299] It says in 1 Timothy 2, what a great example.
[time=2302] Sad, but so clear for us.
[time=2304] It was not Adam who was deceived.
[time=2306] But the woman being deceived who fell into what?
[time=2309] Say it.
[time=2310] Transgression.
[time=2311] I don't know that there was ever a clearer line drawn.
[time=2315] He said, don't eat the fruit.
[time=2321] Can have all of the other stuff.
[time=2324] Don't eat the fruit from that tree line.
[time=2334] And she steps over the line and boom.
[time=2339] Everything.
[time=2341] Everything changes when sin occurs.
[time=2348] We sometimes make light of it.
[time=2350] I don't want to make light of it this morning.
[time=2351] It's why my friends, it's so important.
[time=2353] And I continue to need help with this like I know many of you do.
[time=2356] It is so important that from the very early ages with your kids that you help them understand
[time=2366] lines, that there are lines that can't be crossed.
[time=2371] There are parameters that cannot be toyed with.
[time=2374] And God has asked you as a mom or a dad to draw those lines for them, to help them understand
[time=2381] them and when they cross over them, to help them understand the discomfort and pain and
[time=2388] sorrow that comes with disobedience.
[time=2392] Pomertea.
[time=2393] To miss the mark.
[time=2394] Parabases.
[time=2395] Transgression.
[time=2396] To step over the line.
[time=2398] Iniquity is another word we see in Scripture.
[time=2401] In the New Testament, Anomia.
[time=2402] In the Old Testament, Avon.
[time=2404] To bring stain or ruin upon one's soul.
[time=2407] To contaminate without restraint.
[time=2410] This is the real idea of this word.
[time=2412] To function without restraint.
[time=2414] Evil which is crooked.
[time=2416] I love how in the Scriptures oftentimes God portrays obedience when he tells people to go
[time=2422] in and not go to the what?
[time=2424] Not go to the left or to the right, but just keep going straight.
[time=2430] That's obedience.
[time=2432] It's avoiding sin.
[time=2435] And this idea of iniquity is crooked.
[time=2438] It's when we start taking steps to the left or to the right that bring dishonor to God and dishonor to us.
[time=2445] 106, 6 Psalm 106, 6 says we have sinned like our fathers.
[time=2451] We have committed iniquity.
[time=2453] We have behaved wickedly the people of God again and again in the story of God's walk
[time=2460] in relationship with them, going to the left, going to the right, straying from that which
[time=2467] he called them to do.
[time=2470] So many times, I want to say to myself so many times, I want to say to those I love so
[time=2477] many times, we should say to each other, walk straight.
[time=2482] Walk straight.
[time=2484] Right toward what God has said.
[time=2486] Don't deviate.
[time=2487] To deviate is iniquity.
[time=2489] So any time, listen.
[time=2491] So any time you fall short of God's requirement, how Martilla, any time you step over a line
[time=2499] transgression, any time you function without restraint where God has called for it iniquity, you offend.
[time=2505] And here's where I really want you to start tracking with me this morning.
[time=2508] You offend God fully and completely, you offend him anytime.
[time=2520] You fall short step over a line or function without restraint.
[time=2523] Remember my friends, some sins don't sort of offend God because God isn't sort of holy.
[time=2535] God is fully holy.
[time=2539] And so each and every sin fully offends him.
[time=2546] You can think of the whitest, cleanest, purest sheet in the world.
[time=2553] You just picture something as white as white can be.
[time=2556] And you know what happens when a little dab of ink or a little dab of ketchup, I mean, you have fun with it in your mind, but it's really serious, any little dot.
[time=2566] And you're like, whoa, that's not good.
[time=2571] And this is where we sometimes misconstrue things.
[time=2574] We tend to focus sin discussions like this one on the cultural magnitude or external scope
[time=2585] of what I call sin's ripple effect.
[time=2589] Does that make sense to you?
[time=2590] We sometimes get really caught up in this.
[time=2592] I'll take you back to the quote that I showed you at the beginning of this talk from a friend of mine.
[time=2598] Remember what he said about the neighbor.
[time=2600] It's going to be on the screen here.
[time=2602] He said, I'm not supposed to covet my neighbor's car or house or wife.
[time=2606] That's a sin.
[time=2607] It's not good.
[time=2608] I know.
[time=2609] But, but if I go next door and kill my neighbor, external scope, cultural magnitude, right,
[time=2618] if I go next door and kill my neighbor so I can have his car, I'm sorry.
[time=2622] That's what.
[time=2623] Say it.
[time=2624] Is it?
[time=2630] We can be fooled into thinking that what makes a certain sin a big or bigger deal is the number of ripples
[time=2638] or the size of its splash.
[time=2641] Was it really messy?
[time=2645] Did it affect a lot of people?
[time=2647] That'll tell you how bad it was.
[time=2649] Was it public?
[time=2650] Was it visible?
[time=2651] Was it scandalous?
[time=2652] Was it gross?
[time=2653] Was it really dark?
[time=2655] How heinous and twisted was it?
[time=2660] And see what we've done.
[time=2663] And it's really what got me thinking about this weeks and weeks ago.
[time=2666] What we've done is we've really established a classification level of sins.
[time=2672] And we view it in our minds and our hearts.
[time=2674] We might not say it most of the time you do, but at least we think it.
[time=2678] We believe there are like class A felonsens.
[time=2681] We think there are really, really big ones.
[time=2685] They're really, really bad and dark.
[time=2688] And most of us believe internally or externally that there are these little class C misdemeanors.
[time=2696] That it's just a, it didn't hurt anybody.
[time=2702] I didn't actually even do anything.
[time=2705] I thought this or I, or I did it, but it's just me.
[time=2713] And we've just kind of stair stepped this idea of sin from the little harmless stuff to like,
[time=2720] "Oh my gosh, really, really big stuff." And that's not good.
[time=2725] And I'm going to just show you two pictures.
[time=2727] Gals, if you would, nicks that middle picture.
[time=2729] I want to show you one picture here.
[time=2731] This is what we do when we start kind of focusing on the classification of sins when we make a really big deal out of the heinous awful public scandalous stuff.
[time=2746] We start to kind of view our little private, not going to hurt anybody, didn't really cause any damage.
[time=2753] It's just me, sin.
[time=2756] We kind of view it like that.
[time=2759] It's almost quaint.
[time=2762] I mean, it almost begins to be in our minds kind of harmless.
[time=2766] Yeah, a little pebble or, I don't know, a little drop went in and there's a little ripple.
[time=2773] But it's not much.
[time=2775] And we think that because we get stuck viewing sin as it relates to cultural magnitude and external scope instead of viewing sin as a violation of a holy God who has attached himself to us.
[time=2794] And anything we do that misses the mark, anything, is heinous and awful in his sight.
[time=2802] And the truth is we shouldn't view our sin like that.
[time=2806] We should view our sin whatever our sin like this.
[time=2811] And I'm not trying to be funny or dramatic.
[time=2815] But you need to be reminded that your private little quiet sin is destructive and deadly and it ruins things eventually.
[time=2826] And your big overt, huge scandalous sin is as well.
[time=2833] The fact is all of it is a violation of God's purity and his perfect law and requirement.
[time=2839] And when we miss it, we miss it and it's big.
[time=2845] It's huge.
[time=2846] Classification of sin, it's not how God views it.
[time=2850] The truth is he is so perfect, God is so holy, he is so completely without stain or blemish that any violation, any sin at all is heinous to him.
[time=2861] It is out in the wide open with him and full view with him.
[time=2866] I hear folks talk about private sins.
[time=2868] What are you talking about?
[time=2871] There is nothing private with him at all and whether it's private or public.
[time=2880] It's awful.
[time=2882] Your sin and mine.
[time=2886] Any break with his parameters and boundaries in any way is offensive, it is evil and serious.
[time=2893] Not the number of ripples or their size, it's just that the rock got thrown in the first place.
[time=2902] Amen?
[time=2903] Does that make sense?
[time=2905] Do you understand that?
[time=2906] I hope you do.
[time=2909] One lie that we fall into with sin is getting caught in this cultural magnitude, external expanse.
[time=2918] Oh my gosh, consequences, instead of viewing it as a violation with me and him, the second thing we get lied to about and where we get into trouble is that the enemy will convince you, or at least he will try to convince you that your sin can be quick and harmless.
[time=2937] I won't have you raise your hands, but I know a lot would go up if I said to you how many times has he whispered in your ear, just go ahead.
[time=2945] It'll just be quick and it'll be over.
[time=2950] Don't worry about it and I would just call your attention to this quote.
[time=2956] Many of you have seen it.
[time=2958] It's really true.
[time=2959] It's exactly what God's word teaches.
[time=2961] Sin takes you farther than you want to go.
[time=2965] Sin keeps you longer than you want to stay and it will cost you more than you ever, ever wanted to pay.
[time=2974] Think about it.
[time=2978] Hang on to that.
[time=2980] He tries to fool you and trick you.
[time=2982] It is not true.
[time=2984] Please have a proper understanding of sin.
[time=2988] Now, let me just read a passage to you here.
[time=2993] Understand as we start to head toward the end here this morning, this is really a three-week message.
[time=3001] And so I'm not running out of time here.
[time=3005] We're going to pick this up right where we leave off today.
[time=3009] And then we're going to pick up week three right where we leave off week two.
[time=3013] And so I'm going to dive in here.
[time=3016] I want to read this to you from 1 Corinthians 6.
[time=3019] And as we turn to 1 Corinthians 6, I want you to begin to understand how God views sin.
[time=3025] Listen, Church, how God views all sins.
[time=3030] I believe in many ways the answer to the question are all sins the same.
[time=3035] As it relates to their violation of the person and will and character of God, I believe absolutely yes.
[time=3043] They are all heinous and wicked and evil.
[time=3047] Look what it says in 1 Corinthians 6, 9.
[time=3050] This is really fascinating.
[time=3052] Maybe you've seen this, maybe you haven't.
[time=3053] Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=3059] Most of us say, yeah.
[time=3061] We read that, we go, yeah.
[time=3063] The unrighteous.
[time=3065] The really, really bad.
[time=3067] Because that's like what unrighteous means, right?
[time=3069] The unrighteous aren't going to inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=3072] Well, listen, as Paul goes on here, do not be deceived.
[time=3077] Uh-oh.
[time=3078] Don't be deceived about what?
[time=3080] Here we go.
[time=3081] Neither fornicators.
[time=3083] Uh-huh.
[time=3084] Nor idolaters.
[time=3085] Yeah.
[time=3086] Nor adulterers.
[time=3087] Uh-huh.
[time=3088] See, I told you, nor effeminate nor homosexuals.
[time=3091] Yeah.
[time=3092] Nor thieves.
[time=3093] Nor the, what's that say?
[time=3097] Covedus.
[time=3098] Nor drunkards.
[time=3100] Nor revilers.
[time=3105] You know what covetus means, right?
[time=3108] I like your car.
[time=3109] I don't like mine.
[time=3110] I like yours.
[time=3112] I'm serious.
[time=3113] That's coveting.
[time=3117] No place for them.
[time=3120] In the kingdom of God.
[time=3123] Those who are marked by that.
[time=3125] Those who are characterized by that.
[time=3128] Revilers.
[time=3129] I looked it up.
[time=3131] It means saying bad things to get people upset.
[time=3139] Fornicators, adulterers.
[time=3145] I like your car.
[time=3146] I wish I had it.
[time=3148] Saying bad things to get people upset.
[time=3151] Will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=3157] God views all sins extremely, seriously.
[time=3163] We got Galatians 5.
[time=3167] 17.
[time=3168] Here we're talking about the deeds of the flesh.
[time=3171] These are those things that characterize those who are not living by the spirit.
[time=3176] But living by the flesh, living in contrast to what God has called us to.
[time=3181] The deeds of the flesh, the sins of the flesh are evident.
[time=3185] Which are immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery.
[time=3191] That's witchcraft and stuff.
[time=3193] Wait a minute, wait a minute, enmities.
[time=3197] It's not getting along.
[time=3199] Strife.
[time=3201] Not getting along.
[time=3202] Jealousy.
[time=3203] Outbursts of anger.
[time=3206] Disputes.
[time=3208] Decentions.
[time=3209] I don't like you.
[time=3210] I'm out of here.
[time=3212] Factions.
[time=3214] Enveying.
[time=3217] Drunkenness.
[time=3218] Surrounding and things like these of which I forewarn you just as I have forewarned you
[time=3225] that those who practice such things, those who are characterized in their life by these
[time=3231] endeavors will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=3240] So, a lot to talk about and a lot to get to in the weeks to come.
[time=3244] Here's one thing I just sense and see right away.
[time=3247] And that is that we have so, we have so toyed with the bar of sin.
[time=3255] We have so classified sins out that we have offended, I think, in many ways the holiness
[time=3261] of God.
[time=3262] And we have put ourselves in jeopardy with him by being okay with stuff that he is not
[time=3271] okay with.
[time=3274] And you had better be and I had better be really, really careful.
[time=3279] I want to ask you to bow your heads right where you're at.
[time=3282] A few more things to get to here.
[time=3285] This might be the most important.
[time=3288] I believe that there are some in the room, maybe many today.
[time=3292] And the honest truth is that as you sit here today, you know in your heart that your sin,
[time=3299] your hamartia, your transgression, you're stepping over the line.
[time=3306] You know that's been a part of your life for years and years.
[time=3309] And you know today that you are not in a relationship with God and that your sin has
[time=3315] separated you from him.
[time=3317] And I wonder if today you might just want to experience the rescue and the healing and
[time=3324] the hope that comes from having your sin, all of it, forgiven.
[time=3332] And I want to just encourage you this morning, whoever you are, young, old, wherever you've been, whatever you've done, if you're willing in your heart before God this morning to say this, to just say in your own words, "Oh God, I know that I'm a sinner.
[time=3349] I have missed the mark, I have stepped over the line, I have not walked straight, and
[time=3355] I never will without your help." If you say to him, "Oh God, would you forgive me of my sin?" If you pray to him this morning, "Oh God, would you fill me up with not only your forgiveness
[time=3369] but your spirit and your word?
[time=3372] Oh God, would you give me help and courage to walk in a relationship with you that would
[time=3378] lead me away from my sin and toward the life that you've designed for me to live?"
[time=3387] If you ask for forgiveness this morning, if you invite him to be Lord and ruler of your
[time=3393] life, and if you commit to follow him, no matter what, he hears that prayer.
[time=3398] He redeems you, he saves you right here and now.
[time=3403] And he commits to walk with you in the days to come.
[time=3408] And now Father in Heaven, we just, we believe this morning that there are those in the room who have said those things, they have agreed with you about their sin and they have welcomed your forgiveness made possible because of Christ, His death and resurrection.
[time=3425] Oh God, I pray that we'll meet these people soon, maybe even today.
[time=3429] God, I pray that we'll be able to come alongside them and help them and encourage them.
[time=3434] Oh God, thank you for a study on sin that helps us see and know in a very powerful way
[time=3440] our need for you.
[time=3441] For those of us in the room that have bowed the knee of our heart, we fully surrendered to you and yet our struggle with sin continues.
[time=3449] Oh God, we plead with you today for the strength and help that we desperately need.
[time=3455] Bring us back next week to more fully understand what your word says about this battle with
[time=3461] sin and the road that we can walk and we'll thank you for it.
[time=3466] And everybody in the room agreed with the prayer and said, Amen.
[time=3471] The Bible hour is sponsored today by Linda in honor of her mother, Jenny, who went home to be with the Lord this past June.
[time=3478] How blessed I was, how fortunate I've been that you were my mother and also my friend.
[time=3484] I love you and miss you mom.
[time=3514] [MUSIC]
[time=3544] You
