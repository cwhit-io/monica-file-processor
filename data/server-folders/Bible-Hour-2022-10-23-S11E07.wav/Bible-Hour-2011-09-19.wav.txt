[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] (crowd cheering) - Good morning, everyone.
[time=36] Would you stand with us?
[time=38] Let's lift our voices to God.
[time=40] [MUSIC - 204 seconds]
[time=254] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=256] It's great to have you with us.
[time=258] I am and our team here at Blackhawk are so thankful for the opportunity we get week after week to bring you the life-changing eternity-altering truth of God's word.
[time=268] As I read your emails and as I read your letters, as I bump into you out in public and you graciously tell me of your appreciation for the broadcast, I just want you to know what a huge encouragement that is for me and our team.
[time=283] We are thankful for these times together and I can't wait to see how God is going to continue to grow you and challenge you and encourage you through today's broadcast.
[time=293] I also want to tell you about something that is really exciting for us here in the Blackhawk Ministries world.
[time=300] We are so thankful for our school.
[time=302] You know that Blackhawk Christian School has been affecting and impacting kids and families all over this region for the last 35-plus years.
[time=312] It is an amazing school with an amazing staff and I'm so thankful every day for the difference that they make in the lives of kids.
[time=321] In association with our school and in an effort to financially keep our costs and our tuition reasonable, we're opening a brand new upscale resale store down at Georgetown Square and it's called Renew.
[time=336] Renew is a store that's going to have in it everything you could ever want from clothing items to household needs.
[time=343] You got to come check it out.
[time=345] It's going to be a really, really fun adventure for us.
[time=348] All of the proceeds from Renew are going to be funneled back into our school, back into the ministry of Blackhawk Christian.
[time=356] And so I hope you'll mark that down October 1.
[time=360] Saturday, October 1 is the grand opening and we would love for you to come and look around and buy some things and bring your friends and family.
[time=368] What a great opportunity for us to continue in a real viable way, the ministry of our school.
[time=374] I can't wait to see what God does with Renew.
[time=377] Hey, thank you for tuning in today.
[time=379] Thanks for being a part of our family and as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=949] (gentle music) - This Corbin plays just by your heads, would you just for a moment, and just be reminded this morning here in this moment that it is the holiness of God.
[time=963] It is his perfection.
[time=967] It is the fact that he is set apart and like no other.
[time=972] Amen?
[time=973] He is our holy, perfect, righteous, set apart God, and it's what makes him unique.
[time=980] And it's what makes our worship of him.
[time=983] It's what makes your decision to follow him so unique and so powerful and so right.
[time=991] Father God, what a privilege this morning to have been reminded of that about you.
[time=996] Your pure and holy perfection.
[time=999] And God, as we continue this morning to study and consider the truths regarding sin and depravity, God, the wretchedness of unrighteousness,
[time=1015] the futility God of iniquity.
[time=1018] God, I pray that your Holy Spirit in your word would enlighten us and encourage us in your son's name, we pray.
[time=1026] Amen, amen.
[time=1027] You can be seated.
[time=1028] Thank you, Jonathan.
[time=1029] Thanks, Corbin.
[time=1034] Hey, I want to read you this morning out of a book that I just got introduced to me.
[time=1039] It was a couple of weeks ago that Steve Webster put it on my desk.
[time=1043] It is the book out of which Josh Rang is going to be leading and facilitating one of our upcoming grow groups.
[time=1053] You can look on your grow group insert.
[time=1055] It's Killing Sin.
[time=1057] Killing Sin, a book by Brian Hedges called License to Kill.
[time=1063] The subtitle on the book.
[time=1064] The book is licensed to kill.
[time=1066] The subtitle is a field manual for mortifying sin.
[time=1071] And I'm so grateful for Josh and his willingness to lead this, my goodness friends, as I look through this sheet.
[time=1078] And I think of us as a family, so many great opportunities here.
[time=1082] You know, growing churches are filled with growing people.
[time=1090] Growing churches aren't filled with attenders.
[time=1094] Growing churches are filled with those who are devoted to growing.
[time=1101] And you have been given every opportunity in the world here with these eight.
[time=1105] We might just do these eight again in the spring, 'cause I know it's gonna be hard to pick one, but I really hope all of you will consider being a part of what God is going to do through these grow groups.
[time=1116] I picked up this book, License to Kill.
[time=1119] It's all about mortifying or doing away with sin.
[time=1122] Let me read this for you this morning as we begin.
[time=1126] Corey Byrne was showing off his pet.
[time=1131] Draped over his neck and shoulders was his nine foot long, 25 pound boa constrictor.
[time=1138] To the horror of a watching friend, the reptile's large lumbering coils began to tighten around its owner's neck like a noose.
[time=1149] Slowly, irresistibly, the great snake squeezed Corey's life away.
[time=1154] His air supply was cut off.
[time=1160] His face turned red and he passed out, unable to remove the snake by herself.
[time=1165] Corey's friend called for emergency help, but several hours later Corey died in a local hospital.
[time=1172] Some animals cannot be tamed.
[time=1176] You may call a snake your pet and give it a cute name, but that doesn't take the wild out of it.
[time=1183] No matter how long you've housed, cared for and fed a boa constrictor, it may still turn on you.
[time=1192] After all, it's still a snake.
[time=1195] It's much the same way with sin.
[time=1202] You may cuddle sin like a pet, but that doesn't take the wild out of it or make it less dangerous.
[time=1211] Evil cannot be domesticated.
[time=1216] Sin is poised to attack your faith at any moment.
[time=1218] Sometimes it bears its fangs and strikes in a surprise attack.
[time=1222] Sometimes it's cunning enough to play dead and subtle enough to pose as something good.
[time=1229] But either way, sin is wired to kill.
[time=1232] Slowly, cleverly, when you're not paying attention, sin will squeeze the faith, love, and holiness right out of you.
[time=1241] This is the nature of sin.
[time=1243] Left unchecked, it always, it always, what?
[time=1248] Say it, church, destroys, it always destroys.
[time=1256] Sin are all of them the same.
[time=1260] Are all sins the same?
[time=1263] What a great beginning we had last week as we jumped into God's word and this discussion that we're in regarding are all sins the same.
[time=1271] Last week we looked at three, just real quickly, in case you weren't here, we looked at three biblical phrases or definitions for sin.
[time=1279] We looked at the biblical word sin itself.
[time=1282] You can write these down, sin, hamartia.
[time=1285] It means falling short.
[time=1287] We had somebody come up and I threw soft balls at them, some almost got there, some missed by a mile, some weren't really even thrown.
[time=1296] Sin the Bible says is when we miss the mark of God's standard, falling short.
[time=1303] Remember any standard, any of God's decreed standards.
[time=1308] On any issue, God's requirement missed in any way, shape or form, sin, hamartia.
[time=1317] We looked at the biblical phrase, transgression, stepping over the line, violating boundaries, established by God for our protection and benefit in your life and mind, personally, in business, in family, in relationships, God, because he loves us, not because he's boring, has established lines, clearly established boundaries that we get to by his grace and with his help function within.
[time=1345] And when you step over those lines, when that boundary is crossed, the Bible calls that transgression.
[time=1353] Sin, transgression, and thirdly, we looked at iniquity.
[time=1358] Iniquity, this is living without restraint.
[time=1361] There are times where God calls you and I to live with restraint.
[time=1365] There are places he doesn't want you to go.
[time=1367] There are responses he doesn't want you to have, places you can go and responses that you can have that will violate his will and his character.
[time=1376] And so he calls you and I to live within certain restraints.
[time=1381] Iniquity is when we live outside those restraints, choosing crooked living instead of walking straight.
[time=1389] I'm pretty sure that we were at least, as of last week on the way, to starting to conclude that any act, right, any act, any thought or any attitude that God has declared, that God has declared to be sinful, is fully 100% completely sinful and that it violates his perfect character.
[time=1417] That's why David cried out in Psalm 51, oh God, against you and you alone have I sinned, sin violates God's perfect character and sin brings a breaking of relationship with him.
[time=1432] Any sin, any standard, falling short of that in any way relationship with God broken.
[time=1440] That's why David said, don't cast your Holy Spirit from me, restore unto me the joy of my, bring me back into relationship with you.
[time=1451] This is the great effect of sin.
[time=1455] Thank God for 1 John 1-9, you'll see it on the screen.
[time=1459] Some of you know this, I wanna remind you of this and a couple of other verses as well.
[time=1463] 1 John 1-9, as it relates to your sin, whatever sin it might be.
[time=1468] It says there that if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness, to cleanse us from all boundary crossing, to cleanse us from all lack of restraint, to cleanse us from all marks that have been missed.
[time=1493] There isn't anything that can go on that if you're willing to confess it, he won't forgive it 'cause he is righteous and just.
[time=1503] Let me read you what it says in Proverbs 28, 13, just write these down, 1 John 1-9, Proverbs 28, 13.
[time=1511] He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will find compassion.
[time=1523] That's not gonna be on the screen, but I hope you'll write that down and I hope you caught the last part of that verse, but he who confesses and what, and forsakes them.
[time=1534] Remember, remember friends, repentance is when we agree with God about the sin, that's the first part, and then move, and then move as fast as we can, where there's much energy is needed in the exact opposite direction of that sin.
[time=1552] It says there in Proverbs 28, 13, but he who confesses and forsakes the sin will find compassion.
[time=1561] And I love what it says in Psalm 32.5, it'd be worth turning to and just reading and just taking it in.
[time=1568] It says in Psalm 32.5, we may have even looked at this a couple of weeks ago.
[time=1575] It says in Psalm 32.5, I acknowledged, this is the Psalm of David, he said, I acknowledged my sin to you and my iniquity, there's that word I did not hide.
[time=1587] I said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord and you forgave.
[time=1593] I love this phrase, don't you?
[time=1594] And you forgave the guilt of my sin.
[time=1598] Raise your hand if you've ever felt guilty over your sin this morning.
[time=1603] Praise God that he forgives not only the sin, but praise God my friends, did you hear that?
[time=1610] That he forgives the guilt of your sin.
[time=1614] It's gone, it's removed, not guilty.
[time=1621] Thank God for his forgiveness, same end church.
[time=1624] Somebody asked me last week on that front, on the forgiveness front, they said, are there any, it's a genuine question, someone.
[time=1632] I know personally who's thinking these things through, they wanted to know if there was a sin that was unforgivable since we were talking about sin.
[time=1642] And it was a great opportunity for me to remind this individual that there is one and only one that we're aware of or that we know of that is unforgivable.
[time=1652] The only sin that is unforgivable is the sin of rejecting Christ.
[time=1658] Because at the end of the day, if you reject Christ and his offer of life and forgiveness, if that's how that goes for you, then yeah, there is no forgiveness because you then having lived this life will live the rest of eternity separated from him.
[time=1677] That's how the word of God explains that, that's how the word of God defines that for us.
[time=1684] Other than that, all sins, that you think, all sins that you do, all sins that you engage in, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all and righteousness when we confess.
[time=1702] But as far as sin goes, back to our question, are they all the same?
[time=1707] All sin, any sin is heinous and serious as it relates to God.
[time=1712] Some sins different in their consequences, right?
[time=1716] In the way that sin, now we're moving away from how it affects God, but now as it affects others, as the ripples of that sin kind of carry out, some sin consequences, some sin ripples certainly different than others, that's true.
[time=1732] There might even be different levels.
[time=1734] I was thinking about this this week.
[time=1735] There might even be different levels of thankfulness.
[time=1739] I was talking to a friend as well this week.
[time=1741] We were talking about how thankful we are for the fact that God has forgiven us from this sin and the gratitude that he felt over being forgiven,
[time=1756] that sin compared to the gratitude he felt for being forgiven for this sin a little bit different.
[time=1763] And again, that's kind of on the peripheral.
[time=1765] We've focused our discussion so far on the fact that all sin is a direct violation to the character of a holy God.
[time=1773] And with God, there are no categories of sin.
[time=1780] With God, there are no different levels of sin.
[time=1784] All sin equally offensive.
[time=1786] We took you to 1 Corinthians six last week.
[time=1788] It said that with all unrighteousness, those who live in unrighteousness will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=1797] And then there's this long list of sins.
[time=1799] And it starts out pretty seedy and pretty dark.
[time=1803] It starts out with some of those sins that many of us would have considered biggies.
[time=1807] And then all of a sudden we were reading through 1 Corinthians six and there was jealousy.
[time=1811] There was anger and greed.
[time=1816] And we began to see that in God's eyes and in God's word, there really are no levels.
[time=1822] There really are no categories.
[time=1823] I want to show you one more passage that helps us with this idea of no categories of sin with God.
[time=1830] Turn in your Bibles, would you?
[time=1832] This morning church to Romans one.
[time=1834] Romans chapter one, an entire chapter, really devoted to a biblical description of the depravity or the sinfulness of man left to himself.
[time=1846] Man by his very nature, I think you understand, is sinful.
[time=1851] And here in Romans one, we get this kind of panoramic of the moral spiraling downward of man left to himself.
[time=1859] And I say a moral spiraling downward because I want you in a few minutes here to see where we end up when we get down to the absolute nitty gritty bottom of the barrel.
[time=1873] The most depraved place.
[time=1878] It starts, we'll get there.
[time=1880] I want you to see what's there when we get there.
[time=1882] But it starts back in 21, they knew God, but they didn't honor God or give thanks.
[time=1889] So they became futile in their speculations and their foolish heart was darkened.
[time=1895] So man's heart gets darkened as he puts God off.
[time=1899] And it says in 24, therefore God gave them over.
[time=1905] He gave them over.
[time=1908] It's a phrase that means let them go.
[time=1911] Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity.
[time=1917] So here's impurity church.
[time=1920] So that their bodies would be dishonored among them for they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature with their impurity and their sensuality and all their lusts.
[time=1935] They worshiped and served the creature rather than the who?
[time=1939] The creator who was blessed forever, amen.
[time=1943] For this reason spiraling downward we go, for this reason God gave them over.
[time=1950] Now he lets them go further to degrading passions for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural.
[time=1962] And in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons, receiving in their own bodies the due penalty of their error.
[time=1982] Depravity is now spiraling rampant downward
[time=1988] and just as verse 28 they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer.
[time=1995] God gave them over, now he lets them go all the way.
[time=1998] Gave them over to a depraved mind to do those things which are not proper.
[time=2006] Being filled with all unrighteousness and wickedness and greed and evil full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice.
[time=2016] Being filled with all unrighteousness they are what?
[time=2019] Say it.
[time=2022] Gossips.
[time=2025] Gossipping, what's the next one say?
[time=2030] Slandering.
[time=2032] At the bottom of the immoral slide to depravity.
[time=2039] At the end of he gave them over, he gave them over, he gave them over.
[time=2047] We get down to the worst of the worst and the first thing he says filled with all unrighteousness they are gossips.
[time=2056] Gossip a classic, a classic Class C misdemeanor
[time=2063] in your mind and mind.
[time=2067] No longer.
[time=2069] You should, you should just right now, you should be confessing and repenting of your lifelong, foolish endeavor of trying to somehow classify and segregate sins in the biggies and not so bigs.
[time=2092] Felonies and misdemeanors.
[time=2095] Oh, and it doesn't stop there, gossips, slanderers.
[time=2099] Haters of God, okay, now there we go.
[time=2101] That seems more like it.
[time=2102] Haters of God, insolent, arrogant, oh, it's prideful, boastful, inventors of evil.
[time=2111] Okay, there we go.
[time=2112] Now that's really bad.
[time=2113] Then disobedient to parents.
[time=2115] Without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful.
[time=2120] And although they know the ordinance of God and those that practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.
[time=2131] They know the ordinance of God that those who practice such things are worthy of death.
[time=2139] And when you read through that list and when you go back to Galatians five and read through that list, and when you go back to 1 Corinthians six and read through that list, you begin to clearly understand there are no categories of sin with God.
[time=2153] Here's two practical things for you this morning.
[time=2158] Two things that go really wrong.
[time=2159] Things that get really sideways when you create categories or levels of sin.
[time=2164] Number one, I hope you'll write this down.
[time=2166] When we create categories or levels of sins, we lower the bar.
[time=2173] Write that down.
[time=2173] We lower the bar that Jesus himself tried to raise.
[time=2178] And I wanna show you exactly how he tried to do that, how he did do that.
[time=2184] When you create categories, you lower the bar that Jesus himself tried to raise.
[time=2190] Turn with me, would you to Matthew chapter five?
[time=2193] I wanna show you how Jesus came at sin.
[time=2196] I want you to understand our Lord's perspective on this as we try to be a people who are following after him.
[time=2203] I want you to understand his view of sin.
[time=2206] It says in Matthew five, 27, this.
[time=2210] You have heard that it was said, you shall not commit what, adultery.
[time=2217] Jesus gathers them and says, you've heard it said that you shall not commit adultery, but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery
[time=2233] with her in his heart.
[time=2236] Stop right there.
[time=2243] If you've thought about it, if you've considered it, if you have lustfully imagined it, he says, you're in trouble.
[time=2255] All sin, any sin is so serious that Jesus in an effort to protect us from sin's destructive nature raises the bar on sin.
[time=2268] Now you say, you say, wait a minute.
[time=2271] Kelly, is Jesus really teaching?
[time=2274] I've had people ask me this before, had somebody asked me after first hour, if I really think that Jesus is really teaching, that if I lust about being with another woman and for the record ladies, I know the text here deals with a man lusting for a woman.
[time=2289] I don't think for a moment that you're free from this.
[time=2292] I do not think for a moment that men are the only gender that lusts.
[time=2301] But the text says, and the question was asked, do I really think that what he's saying is if I just lust about being with another woman, that it's really like it's the same as committing adultery.
[time=2316] And I'm telling you this morning, I believe that is what Jesus is teaching.
[time=2320] I believe that with all of me.
[time=2324] I believe that is exactly what he is trying to communicate to you and to me and what he was communicating to these people who lived in the midst of a Pharisaical system and a religious atmosphere where everything had swung to externals to the abuse of and the absolute absence of heart assessment.
[time=2348] Somebody wrote me a note last week.
[time=2356] They said, if Matthew five is true, then why wouldn't I just, if it's all the same, why wouldn't I just go do it anyway?
[time=2362] And you know, and I tried to help him understand that.
[time=2364] Romans six says, may it never be.
[time=2366] Should we sin that grace may increase?
[time=2369] May it never be.
[time=2371] Paul says, we don't ever approach sin that way.
[time=2374] Jesus doesn't approach it that way here.
[time=2377] Well, then you might say to me this morning, that seems, you might say to me this morning, well, that seems picky.
[time=2388] And I would say to you this morning, exactly.
[time=2391] Exactly.
[time=2394] He is unbelievably picky about sin.
[time=2400] God doesn't want any of it near his kids.
[time=2407] He wants none of it near those he loves.
[time=2410] He wants its infiltrating power kept far from those he has redeemed.
[time=2415] And Jesus raises the bar.
[time=2417] You know why?
[time=2420] Because he knows a little love and ruins the whole oath.
[time=2423] He knows the smallest of transgressions leads to ruin.
[time=2427] He has seen, think about it, think about it.
[time=2429] He has seen firsthand how the most seemingly small infraction can lead to unspeakable evil.
[time=2436] My mind went to two instances this week as I thought about this.
[time=2442] I thought about the unspeakable evil that Jesus himself experienced.
[time=2449] And I know he let it happen.
[time=2451] I realized that, but I go back to the crucifixion.
[time=2453] I go back to him being arrested.
[time=2456] I go back to the beatings.
[time=2457] I go back to the torture.
[time=2458] I go back to that awful night and morning.
[time=2461] And my mind just went back to the guy that kind of kicked it all off.
[time=2467] Who turned him over to the authorities.
[time=2470] That guy's name was what?
[time=2472] Judas.
[time=2473] And I just started thinking about it.
[time=2475] Wow.
[time=2476] This unspeakable evil, this awful.
[time=2479] My mind starts going back through the scenes of passion of the Christ, which I don't even watch anymore.
[time=2485] 'Cause I can't stand to see what he endured.
[time=2487] And my mind goes back to Judas.
[time=2490] And he just wanted some money.
[time=2495] I don't know if Jesus didn't pay well.
[time=2500] I don't get exactly what was going on there.
[time=2503] But he wanted a few more pieces of silver.
[time=2505] It was greed.
[time=2506] I say it was just greed, but see how we say that?
[time=2510] It was just greed, but it wasn't just greed.
[time=2513] Look what it did.
[time=2514] Look what it led to.
[time=2516] Look at the doors that opened.
[time=2518] I think of the story told to me since I was a boy.
[time=2523] We sometimes go to Isaiah or Ezekiel to support it.
[time=2528] I'm not so sure it's there in Isaiah or Ezekiel, but nonetheless tradition tells us about Lucifer.
[time=2534] The angel who had it all, but he wanted what?
[time=2539] More.
[time=2541] And when you think about the evil, when you think about the unspeakable iniquity that has come from Lucifer following his fall from grace, and he didn't murder anybody, he didn't steal anything.
[time=2553] He just wanted more.
[time=2559] And so you and I have to be so very careful with our wanting more.
[time=2562] We have to be careful with our little class C, three misdemeanors that we don't think are a big deal.
[time=2568] They're a really big deal because sin is a big deal.
[time=2571] You have heard it said, Jesus says, but I say forget your external levels and get picky about sin.
[time=2579] Second thing that happens when we create categories
[time=2586] or levels of sins, we lessen the fight.
[time=2591] Do you understand this?
[time=2592] We weaken the war that Jesus called us to carry out.
[time=2597] You say, what war?
[time=2599] What fight did Jesus call us to carry out against sin?
[time=2604] We'll go back to Matthew five.
[time=2606] Look at Matthew five, 29, right after the adultery section.
[time=2613] With lust for her, anyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
[time=2621] If your eye, 29, if your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it from you.
[time=2629] For it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
[time=2636] If your right hand makes you stumble, cut it off.
[time=2643] And throw it from you.
[time=2645] For it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.
[time=2652] Now he's saying, was he really serious?
[time=2658] He was serious about adultery.
[time=2659] Now you're gonna tell me he wasn't serious?
[time=2661] I think he's serious.
[time=2662] I think he's using this as an indication.
[time=2664] I think he's painting a picture for you of how serious he thinks you should take this.
[time=2672] If you go to Matthew 18, we see the same thing and it's a little bit repetitive, but I wanna read it to you again.
[time=2679] He says the same thing in Matthew 18, eight and nine.
[time=2683] Again, what kind of fight should we wage against sin?
[time=2687] What kind of a war should go on?
[time=2689] How far should we be willing to go in our fight against iniquity?
[time=2694] It says if your hand, if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble,
[time=2701] cut it off and throw it from you.
[time=2703] Yeah, I'll stop right there.
[time=2707] I was reading that this week.
[time=2708] I just think that phrase and throw it far from you is interesting.
[time=2712] Why do you think he says that?
[time=2716] Cut off your hand if it causes you to sin.
[time=2720] Cut it off and by the way, throw it far from you.
[time=2725] I don't think plastic surgery was big back then?
[time=2731] But I think as I've read and as I've thought about it, I think there's just a very clear message being sent.
[time=2738] Cut it off, this hand that causes you to sin and chuck it.
[time=2743] As far away from you as you can, don't let it come back, don't think about it, be done with it, be over with it.
[time=2750] Don't try to think of ways that just be finished.
[time=2754] Cut it off and throw it away.
[time=2757] And live the rest of your life with whatever you gotta live with, but it's gone.
[time=2762] That thing that led you, that thing that helped you, that thing that wasn't accomplice with you in sin.
[time=2770] If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out
[time=2776] and throw it from you.
[time=2778] It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery hell.
[time=2786] The fight against sin, when the bar gets lowered, the fight goes away.
[time=2792] I'll explain that to you in a moment, but real quick, go back to Hebrews.
[time=2795] Go ahead, open your Bibles.
[time=2796] If you haven't already, I want you to go back to Hebrews and I want you to see this with me.
[time=2800] Hebrews chapter 12, verse one and verse four, listen to how the author of Hebrews describes the fight.
[time=2809] Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, therefore, since the stakes are so high and the example has been set.
[time=2819] Let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and let us run with endurance, the race that is set before you.
[time=2832] Just quickly, we've looked at that before.
[time=2834] Let me just remind you, there's two things in play here.
[time=2837] There is sin in play, but he says before sin comes encumbrance.
[time=2842] There are those things that lead you to sin.
[time=2845] Let me say that again.
[time=2846] There are those people that lead you to sin.
[time=2850] Let me say that again.
[time=2851] There are those circumstances that you and I can walk into that lead us to sin.
[time=2858] There are these situations.
[time=2860] There are these places.
[time=2862] There are these roads that we can walk that lead us to sin.
[time=2867] Those are called encumbrances.
[time=2868] Sin hasn't happened yet, but he says, even those things, they're in the text.
[time=2876] In Hebrews 12.1, it says, let us lay aside, the word means to strip off.
[time=2884] It's an aggressive word that talked about the stripping off of an outer garment that was in the way as one prepared to run a race.
[time=2893] It's a stripping off of it.
[time=2895] It's a throwing it to the side, the encumbrance.
[time=2898] And he says, and then even the sin.
[time=2901] So the fight, biblically for us, isn't just against the sin, it's for anything or any one or any circumstance that might even lead you to sin.
[time=2910] And then look what it says in verse four.
[time=2912] As it relates to the fight, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding what?
[time=2917] Blood in your striving against what?
[time=2922] Say sin.
[time=2924] Shedding blood in the Greek implies an exhausting effort.
[time=2929] Think about your fight against sin.
[time=2931] Is it exhausting?
[time=2932] An exhausting effort, both emotionally and physically.
[time=2935] It is a painful effort.
[time=2938] Sin's drastic nature, its ability to completely destroy calls for drastic action in the fight against it.
[time=2946] I know an individual who took this to heart and began to drive home, he began to choose a different route going home because there were things on the route going home that weren't good.
[time=2960] And he actually began to think through life at that level.
[time=2966] He wanted to avoid anything.
[time=2968] And every, he changed his route home.
[time=2971] He drove a different way.
[time=2974] Went by different places in an effort to keep his heart and his mind fixed.
[time=2980] There are filters that you can put on your computer.
[time=2988] You can break up with him, you know.
[time=2993] You can end it with her.
[time=2999] I was so encouraged, just two weeks ago,
[time=3006] I ended up meeting with a couple that I had met with months before and it's always an interesting conversation when I meet with a couple, planning on getting married, talking about wedding dates.
[time=3019] And sometimes it comes out really forth rightly and sometimes it's sort of hidden.
[time=3026] But in this instance, it was very forth rightly and admittedly they were believers but young in their faith and trying to figure things out and they had chosen to live together.
[time=3038] Saving money.
[time=3041] Just trying to get to that date and coming here and still coming here and we had a long talk about that.
[time=3051] About God's design for the physical relationship and not defiling, it says the marriage bed and keeping that relationship pure.
[time=3062] And it was a really healthy conversation and I just bumped into him a few weeks ago and they figured it out.
[time=3068] They figured out how to live in a way and in places not together that honored God and they're still working on their relationship.
[time=3075] They're excited about getting married but they were willing to fight this thing and go to great lengths for them that stretched their faith and really in time grew them in their faith.
[time=3089] You see what happens, my friends is this, listen,
[time=3095] when the sin bar has been lowered and you now get to live comfortably in your compromise, then there's not a lot of fighting against sin going on.
[time=3108] When you've chosen to categorize this thing and you're living comfortably in your misdemeanors that really just aren't a big deal.
[time=3118] Well, if they're not a big deal, then why are you gonna fight against them?
[time=3122] You're not, so there's no fight.
[time=3124] Sin reigns, compromise continues and you exist and you deal with that simply by looking at your brother or sister stuck in the mire and mud of that big ugly deal over there and you say, well, it's not a biggie, so I'm good.
[time=3143] Or maybe you're not good, you're just not that, what?
[time=3147] Bad.
[time=3147] Jesus says, don't just stay out of bed with her.
[time=3152] Don't think about her that way.
[time=3157] Don't not kill them.
[time=3159] Be kind to them.
[time=3164] And I wanna just give you some things today before we leave.
[time=3169] Actually, we're not gonna leave.
[time=3169] We're gonna experience communion together.
[time=3172] Steve's gonna come up and lead us before he does that.
[time=3174] I wanna give you two things to take home.
[time=3176] Really closely connected.
[time=3179] Two things for you to take with you today.
[time=3181] Book of James says we can't just be hearers of the word.
[time=3184] We must be what?
[time=3185] Doers, so here is some doing for you to do this week.
[time=3189] I mean it, I want you to write these things down.
[time=3192] The degree to which you apply the truth is the degree to which you grow.
[time=3196] So here's two things for you.
[time=3198] Number one, get picky.
[time=3199] I'm asking all of you this week to get picky as it relates to your sin.
[time=3204] Quit compromising.
[time=3206] Raise the bar back up high in your home, in your personal world, in your marriage, in the way you conduct yourself in the marketplace.
[time=3216] Raise the bar back up high right now, right now in that seat where you sit in this moment, I want you to identify.
[time=3223] I want you to determine one or two practices.
[time=3227] One or two things that you know aren't right in your life that this week will not be allowed.
[time=3237] You're gonna draw a really big line in the sand.
[time=3240] You're gonna put a big old stake in the ground and you're gonna say this week I'm gonna get picky on these two things.
[time=3247] Stuff that's been going on that if assessed through a Matthew 5 picky lens must come to an end.
[time=3256] Time to gouge it out, cut it off, throw it away.
[time=3258] And here's the thing, I want you to tell someone, you've got to tell someone in your world.
[time=3263] You gotta tell your spouse, you gotta tell your small group leader, you gotta tell somebody you're in accountability with, you gotta speak it out loud to a good and trusted friend.
[time=3272] You cannot just determine to do this in your mind right now this week and somehow expect to carry it off.
[time=3279] No, you gotta bring people into this mix and get picky and cease the compromise on that issue or that issue.
[time=3287] You pick it, you determine what it is.
[time=3290] Kids, parents, everybody.
[time=3294] Secondly, very related.
[time=3297] Secondly, ask someone you love and trust to help you fight a specific sin.
[time=3302] Find a friend and fight, don't fight the friend.
[time=3304] Find a friend and fight the sin.
[time=3308] Ask someone that you love and trust to help you fight a specific sin.
[time=3314] Now listen, I mean fight.
[time=3317] I mean both barrels loaded, stop at nothing, resist to the point of shedding blood kind of fight.
[time=3328] And I love it when I hear about people who are willing to go like way outside the box.
[time=3333] I love it when I see people who are inspired by the truth and this standard that God has created, who are willing to go to great lengths, to just commit to do things and to do them.
[time=3346] And I hear about them and I understand why and I go, wow, they really took this serious.
[time=3351] They understand they're beginning to get how important it is to fight against and mortify sin, license to kill a field manual for the mortification of sin, the killing of sin.
[time=3369] Ask someone to help you.
[time=3370] Be willing and ready to be picky this week and fight like you've never fought.
[time=3377] Well, hey, let me just ask you if you would to just bow your heads and I have Steve come up here.
[time=3384] And we're gonna finish off the morning.
[time=3387] I'm so thankful for the conversation I had this week with one that I respect greatly.
[time=3395] She wrote me saying how discouraged she was that in the message last week listening to me, she had come to realize that her homosexual friends and her alcoholic friends couldn't go to heaven.
[time=3410] And it was a great opportunity as I tried to help her understand sin more clearly.
[time=3417] I tried to help her understand and I want you to understand this morning, the only reason someone ends up in hell is they rejected Christ.
[time=3426] That's it.
[time=3429] The one who could cure them of their immorality, which is just as bad as their greed, gossip, homosexuality or murder.
[time=3438] I said it to her this way.
[time=3439] I said, oh, please hear this.
[time=3441] I said murderers don't end up in hell.
[time=3443] Unforgiven sinners do.
[time=3445] And your unforgiven sin may look like this and his unforgiven sin may look like that.
[time=3452] What they look like isn't the issue.
[time=3454] The issue my friends is sin and the need it creates in us for forgiveness.
[time=3461] And so Father in heaven as we continue in this study next week, we pray that you would go before us as we come back and teach on and look at the holiness of God.
[time=3471] But now God in these moments that are ahead this morning, would you be present and would you be so very real to us as we remember the sacrifice of your son that freed us from this awful sin.
[time=3486] In your son's name I pray.
[time=3488] [AMEN] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[time=3524] (upbeat music)
