[time=288] [APPLAUSE]
[time=290] Well, good morning and welcome again to the broadcast.
[time=293] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=298] And we have the privilege of bringing to you week after week this broadcast that has been known for over 40 years as the Bible Hour.
[time=306] The Bible Hour has a very basic and foundational commitment.
[time=310] And I want to just remind you of what that commitment is today.
[time=314] Our commitment is to do our very best to bring to you week after week practical, life-changing, life-transforming teaching.
[time=322] Not because the teaching comes from us, but because the teaching comes from the very Word of God.
[time=328] We are as devoted as we've ever been to the fact that God's Word is eternal and it is relevant and it can change and transform our lives.
[time=338] And when we not only listen to it, but when we study it, when we read it, when we meditate on it, when we apply its truth to our lives,
[time=349] it has the capacity to absolutely and utterly change us.
[time=353] And so that's why I say week after week, I'm glad that you've joined us.
[time=357] I'm thankful that you get to hear the Word of God.
[time=360] And I'm so thankful that I get to do my best with God's help to teach it and explain it.
[time=365] And I want to just tell you about the next couple of weeks here at Blackhawk.
[time=369] If you're a regular part of our viewing audience and you don't have a church family that you go and actually sit with and live life with,
[time=378] I want to invite you to come on a Sunday morning here soon.
[time=382] The first two Sundays in October are going to be two Sundays devoted to really focusing on one of the things that's most important for you and me to focus on.
[time=393] And that is our spiritual growth.
[time=395] We can't just be attenders.
[time=397] We can't just be Bible readers.
[time=400] We can't just be church members.
[time=402] We need to be people who are actively engaged in the process of spiritual growth.
[time=408] And so come and join us.
[time=410] The first two Sundays in October for a series we're entitled and grow or die because really that's the truth.
[time=416] You're either growing or you're not.
[time=419] And if you're not growing, whether you're an individual in one's spiritual life,
[time=425] whether you're a baby, a young child, whether you're a plant, whatever we're talking about.
[time=431] Any living organism, if it's not growing, it's dying.
[time=435] And we don't want you to die.
[time=437] We want you to grow.
[time=438] So come and be with us as we take the Word of God and apply it to this amazing concept of spiritual growth.
[time=444] I know I need it.
[time=446] And so our hope and our prayer is that you'll come and join us on October 2nd and October 9th for grow or die.
[time=454] And it's going to be a time I think God's going to use in a very special way.
[time=458] I hope you'll come.
[time=459] I hope you'll come and be with us.
[time=461] We sure are thankful for you.
[time=463] Thanks for tuning in today.
[time=464] God be with you.
[time=465] And as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=489] [MUSIC] Oh, worship the King [MUSIC] Oh, glory, Saha [MUSIC] Oh, gratefully sing [MUSIC] His wonderful love [MUSIC] Our human youth [MUSIC] And the ancient of days [MUSIC] A villain in splendor [MUSIC] And burning in the rain [MUSIC]
[time=553] [AMEN] Thanks for singing his praises with us.
[time=556] You may be seated.
[time=559] [MUSIC - 134 seconds]
[time=697] Everything good, everything right, everything holy, everything right, everything worth it all that I should.
[time=733] Everything good, everything good, everything good, everything good, everything good, everything good.
[time=763] Well, hey, I'm grateful to be with you this morning so thankful that Steve Webster is joining me today.
[time=772] Steve and I are together going to do our best to wrap up our teaching over these last couple of weeks.
[time=778] We've entitled the series are all sins the same.
[time=781] It has been our hope to look at this issue of sin, to teach you as much as we could in a couple of weeks.
[time=788] It's really the doctrine of sin, how important it is that we see sin in the way that God sees sin.
[time=795] And so we come today to week three and what I want to do is just ask Steve, I don't know if you know this,
[time=801] but Steve is mainly responsible for the digging deeper resource that I know many of you access each week.
[time=808] Many more of you should.
[time=810] Every week on our website about Wednesday or Thursday you can download a document entitled Digging Deeper.
[time=816] And Steve and others work on this and it is a continuation of the discussion that we have on Sundays.
[time=822] Whatever the message was Sunday morning, you have a chance to kind of further that discussion.
[time=828] And it is a great document, great for your own personal times of study, great for your small group to participate with.
[time=835] You really should take advantage of it, but I'm saying that to you because Steve, probably like no one else around here,
[time=842] knows because of that what I've been teaching on and the heart and the spirit behind it.
[time=848] And I ask Steve to just kind of give us a brief recap of the last two weeks.
[time=853] Some of you have been here, others of you maybe haven't, and so as we've jumped into this series, listen as Steve kind of catches you up and then I'm going to jump back in and tell you where we're going this morning.
[time=863] So welcome Steve, give us a little recap on the last couple of weeks.
[time=869] Okay, we started on September 11th talking about sin and who defines what sin is.
[time=876] Kelly talked about a certain ant of his that was very particular about things.
[time=884] And we are both thankful that Kelly's ant doesn't define what sin is, but God defines what sin is.
[time=891] Everything that God wants us to know about our choices, all the things that we need to know
[time=899] from him have been contained for us and laid out for us in Scripture.
[time=903] 1 Peter 1, 2 Peter 1, 3 says this.
[time=906] "His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness
[time=913] through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence."
[time=920] More on his glory and excellence in a little bit, but his divine power has given us all the things that we need,
[time=927] not that we want necessarily, but that we need.
[time=930] It's laid out for us in his word.
[time=932] God's word is a precious and sacred gift to his people.
[time=938] God's word is the disclosing of himself over centuries of time to his people.
[time=944] And he wants to be known, he wants to be found, and our choices, our lives, our thoughts,
[time=951] and guidance for those things has all been laid out for us in his word.
[time=955] God is the authority from the book of Deuteronomy, more on that coming this fall, and what's going to lead to blessing or cursing, that word holiness in Deuteronomy
[time=966] occurs 11 times and 76 times in Leviticus, it matters to him, my holiness, my choosing of everything good.
[time=975] Right? That was terrible.
[time=977] That wasn't bad.
[time=979] That wasn't bad at all.
[time=981] Please don't clap.
[time=982] My choosing of everything good and holy and right and worthy, it matters to him.
[time=988] It just does.
[time=990] More to come on that, Kelly defined back in week one, some words for sin quickly.
[time=996] The word sin is a missing of the market, so if I'm aiming for it and miss it, even if I just a little bit, I've still missed.
[time=1003] The word iniquity is also used a lot in the Bible for sin.
[time=1006] The word iniquity has to do with a stain or a blot or an internal kind of falling short.
[time=1014] And then there's transgression.
[time=1015] The word for transgression is the King James' word, "trust pass." And as though God says, "Yeah, there's the line, don't cross it," and we go, "Okay." He's right across it.
[time=1026] That's a transgression.
[time=1027] That's as simple as I can define it for you.
[time=1030] I have to say at this point, I might say it again, you'll forgive me.
[time=1035] The boundaries that God lays out for us in his word, what God defines as sin and only him,
[time=1042] he hasn't told me to not do certain things or not go certain places or not think about certain things because he wants me to not have any fun.
[time=1050] Because God is a cosmic sort of killjoy with a no button in the sky.
[time=1053] No, no, no.
[time=1056] That's not God's posture toward me or toward you.
[time=1062] God loves you with an everlasting love as a good father.
[time=1068] And because he does, he has said, "Don't go there.
[time=1072] Don't do those things." In fact, don't even think about that.
[time=1076] So it was a defining of sin in week one and week two quickly.
[time=1080] We read from a book that my dear friend Josh Rang is going to lead one of those growth groups on coming up in a couple of weeks and I would just echo Kelly's sentiments about signing up.
[time=1090] We are very excited about that whole process.
[time=1093] The class that Josh is going to teach is called "killing sin" and there's a real need for us to be violent with our sin because it can't be domesticated.
[time=1101] Sin makes a very bad pet.
[time=1103] You can quote me on that.
[time=1105] Sin is not going to sit down and roll over or play dead.
[time=1111] It cannot be.
[time=1112] The analogy from the book is of a python wrapping its coils around its owner.
[time=1118] It can't be domestic.
[time=1119] It was never meant to be.
[time=1121] There is one who has conquered sin and I'm not him and neither are you.
[time=1127] Sin left unchecked.
[time=1129] Unchecked will destroy.
[time=1132] Those sin is violation of God's will, the violation of God's character.
[time=1136] And again, please see God with regard to sin here.
[time=1140] God is a father watching his small children run toward oncoming traffic.
[time=1146] Now, I have two kids.
[time=1148] You know this about me.
[time=1149] Four and eight.
[time=1150] Hannah and Christian, Hannah's eight, Christian's four.
[time=1152] If I saw Hannah and Christian running toward oncoming traffic, I wouldn't say now, now, now Christian.
[time=1157] Don't do that.
[time=1159] There would be some intensity in my voice.
[time=1163] No, I'd run, I'd dive.
[time=1165] I'd do anything I could to keep them from that oncoming traffic, from their harm.
[time=1169] That's God toward you and me about sin.
[time=1174] No, don't do that.
[time=1177] Stay away.
[time=1179] His concern for us.
[time=1180] God's not casual with our sin and neither should we be casual with our sin.
[time=1187] He's not interested in depriving you of joy, but he's made known to you the path of life.
[time=1192] Psalm 16 says in his presence there's fullness of joy that his right hand are forever more pleasures.
[time=1199] So having that perspective of sin, avoiding a categorization of sin, don't confuse it with the sociology of sin.
[time=1208] If I knew one of you in here had killed someone else, there would be a different kind of way that would be in the room.
[time=1214] Oh, wow, you know, that's not what we're talking about.
[time=1218] All falling short of God's glory.
[time=1220] Every little, there's no degrees of missing.
[time=1223] If I miss, I miss.
[time=1224] That's been the point of these first two weeks is to not make it seem as though that my lies don't matter to him because they do.
[time=1231] That my greenness doesn't matter to him because it does.
[time=1234] The dissensions I'm causing in my relationships, those matter to him as well.
[time=1238] And God cares about the big sins as we would define them in the room too.
[time=1242] Don't get me wrong.
[time=1244] But the danger of letting my guard down and acting like my theft from my workplace doesn't matter is a real danger to be avoided.
[time=1253] Yeah.
[time=1254] So we want to today, we want to in the time that we've got left, we want to teach you about the holiness of God.
[time=1263] And right away, I just want to answer the question that maybe pops into your mind why the holiness of God to end our series, our series that we've entitled are all sins the same.
[time=1275] So let's just go back to the question.
[time=1277] We've been answering it in the first two weeks.
[time=1279] Steve already kind of answered it again there.
[time=1282] Are all sins the same?
[time=1283] Yes, all sins are the same when we define sin, not as a violation that is comparable to yours, not when I look at sin as class three misdemeanors and felonies, because you see when I do that, now all of a sudden sins are different.
[time=1302] But if I define sin, if I look at sin, if our view of sin is simply and only, our sin in comparison to the character of God than every sin, no matter what size, no matter where it takes place is a heinous offense to a holy God.
[time=1324] And so today, we want to teach you about the holiness of God, because here's the deal, God has called you, God has called me anybody who has fully surrendered their hearts and lives to Christ, who has entered into this relationship with God.
[time=1341] He's a holy God, we want to show you that.
[time=1344] You and I still struggle with sin, so how is it in our ongoing view of sin, how are we to view our sin as it relates, not to our neighbor, but to this holy God that we've been called into intimacy with.
[time=1360] This is where we need to focus, this is what we need to consider, how do we view sin, how do we approach sin, how do we fight sin in light of a holy, perfect God.
[time=1372] Steve's going to give you right out of the gate here, he's going to give you a great brief, write it down, definition of the holiness of God, go for it.
[time=1382] Let's define it together this way, that God is completely other, he's not anything like me, he's absolutely exceptional in his majesty and his moral purity.
[time=1401] First Timothy 6 says that God dwells in unapproachable light, that is who he is, that's where he dwells.
[time=1412] Charles Spurgeon once said that the study of God is something that's so vast that all of our thoughts are lost in its immensity.
[time=1422] It's so deep that our pride is drowned in its infinity and so words like omniscience and holiness and ineffable, ineffable love is from the song.
[time=1437] It's love that's so great that you can't even speak it. His love is so great, it's kind of odd to say that in a song, ineffable love, but there it is, that's what it means.
[time=1448] So some people hear those words and they're overwhelmed by it, biologists named Sir Julian Huxley said that God reminded him of like a cosmic Cheshire cat.
[time=1459] The gods kind of up there in the sky are like, and then Dave Matthews banned, we'll talk about God having this mischievous grin.
[time=1467] So not everybody's comforted by the holiness of God, when you come in from a certain perspective and you're wary of God and you're looking at him from a certain view,
[time=1474] in the line the witch in the wardrobe, Mrs. Beaver chronicles with Narnia.
[time=1479] C.S. Lewis describes a scene where Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, they can talk, animals read the books, you won't regret it, talk about them all the time.
[time=1488] Mr. and Mrs. Beaver are preparing Lucy to go meet Aslan and Mrs. Beaver can't imagine a scenario in which somebody would go talk to Aslan on their knees knocking the whole time, not be terrified before him.
[time=1501] So what she's trying to understand, she says, well, is he isn't safe?
[time=1506] And then the Mr. Beaver says, whoa, Mrs. Beaver, don't you hear what Mrs. Beaver tells you?
[time=1513] Who said anything about safe?
[time=1515] Of course he isn't safe, but he's good.
[time=1519] So we have to temper, friend, temper is the wrong way of saying it.
[time=1522] We have to marry God's holiness with his grace.
[time=1527] So if God is completely other than he is and he is perfect in his power and in his moral purity, and he is, that can be crushing to someone.
[time=1539] There can be a sense of it's torture, but we have to marry it with grace.
[time=1545] God is a gracious God who has come to dwell among us in the person of his son and made it provision for all the things that we need for life and godliness.
[time=1554] So holiness and grace are friends.
[time=1557] And if they weren't, then the God of the Bible would look a lot like other gods in the world that are false gods.
[time=1564] He would look like a god that was invented by people, but he's not, and he hasn't been.
[time=1569] He is transcendently awesome, and he is as, he's near, he is near to us.
[time=1574] There's no other god in the world that can even come close to that description.
[time=1579] And so as we talk about the holiness of God, as we talk about God's transcendent, awesome, wonderfulness, please understand that this God has also come near to us in the person of his son and is ready with his grace, this very hour to meet you where you are as a needful, sinful person.
[time=1599] Awesome.
[time=1600] Okay.
[time=1601] We want to do this next part a little quickly so we don't have to rush at the end.
[time=1606] So bear with us, we want to teach you, show you from the word of God, the holiness of God.
[time=1612] We want to just take you to a couple passages, Isaiah 6 and then to Revelation 4, and we want you to just be reminded of it.
[time=1618] For some of you, maybe you'll see it for the first time, but the holiness of God clearly taught, given to us in the scriptures, would you turn to Isaiah chapter 6.
[time=1627] We're going to look at verses 1 through 5, Isaiah 6 verses 1 through 5, open up your Bibles, turn there in the Old Testament to Isaiah just after Psalms and Proverbs and Psalms and Solomon, and then you come to Isaiah 6.
[time=1642] It says in Isaiah 6 1, ready?
[time=1644] Here we go.
[time=1645] In the year of King Uzziah's death, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, this is Isaiah speaking, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne lofty and exalted with the train of his robe filling the temple, and it was no small temple.
[time=1662] Seraphim, angels, stood above him, each having six wings with two we covered his face and with two we covered his feet and with two he flew.
[time=1672] And one, Seraphim, called out to another and said, holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of his glory.
[time=1684] The foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out while the temple was filling with smoke.
[time=1694] Then I said, whoa, whoa is me, for I am ruined because I'm a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips.
[time=1706] For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts. Here's three things I want you to write down quickly.
[time=1714] Please catch all three about the holiness of God.
[time=1717] Here in Isaiah 6, first of all, God's holiness is seen in the great contrast that Isaiah gives us here.
[time=1726] The great contrast between God and Isaiah.
[time=1730] Now when I say contrast, I don't know what comes to your mind, here's what comes to my mind when I hear somebody talk about the great contrast.
[time=1738] It's the vast difference between the two things that are being contrasted.
[time=1744] The vast difference between the two things accentuates the reality of both.
[time=1751] Did you get that when you're contrasting? The vast difference between the two things simply serves to accentuate or illuminate the reality of both.
[time=1763] I'm going to try this. I haven't asked for permission on this.
[time=1766] I'm going to try Emma, Emma Reber. Would you come here just for a second real quick? She's so brave. I knew she would do it.
[time=1773] Come here, Emma. This is a good friend of mine. Everybody say hi, Emma.
[time=1776] Hi, Emma.
[time=1777] Come here, sweetie. Real quick. This is going to take a minute.
[time=1779] I'm going to just, this is a literary thing Isaiah does. I want you to just see it in person. Hi, sweetheart.
[time=1784] Stand right here. This is my friend, Emma Reber, and her heart's beating really fast right now.
[time=1789] And when Emma stands next to Pastor Bird, we contrast two things.
[time=1796] And in the contrasting, we simply accentuate the reality of both.
[time=1801] The reality is, standing next to me, Emma looks very small.
[time=1806] And I look very what? Big God. That was kind. Thank you.
[time=1811] Tall, short, big, small. If I had Chris, raise your hand, Chris. If I'd Chris come up and we contrast, it wouldn't quite be the thing.
[time=1821] But Isaiah is showing us in the contrasting words of this passage, how low he is, how high God is.
[time=1829] It's an incredible picture, and you did a great job. Give Emma a hand.
[time=1833] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1838] Let me show you this. God, the contrast between God and Isaiah, we've got, on the one hand, God, the Lord sitting lofty and exalted, the text says, on the throne.
[time=1850] Do you understand, in the throne room, literally, the throne is exalted. It's lifted up. It's elevated.
[time=1857] You walk into the temple, and the throne is up there, and there sits the lofty, exalted Lord with the angels doing their thing.
[time=1867] It's absolutely awe-inspiring. It is spectacular.
[time=1872] I told Steve the first time I ever saw the Wizard of Oz.
[time=1878] Remember the first time you ever saw the Wizard of Oz? In that scene where she walks into the throne room, if you will, and there's Oz up on the screen.
[time=1886] And the smoke things are going, and the music's playing.
[time=1891] I was, as a kid, the first time I saw it, I was petrified. It scared me.
[time=1897] This is way beyond Oz. It's way beyond the Emerald City.
[time=1903] This is the Lord lifted high and exalted, literally elevated.
[time=1907] The text says, surrounded by majestic seraphim, who serve, worship, and make much of him for all of time.
[time=1914] The Lord's mere presence literally shakes the very foundations of the building, as it fills with smoke due to the strength of his glory.
[time=1924] It is a pristinely powerful, overwhelmingly pure awe-inspiring scene.
[time=1934] And then on the other hand, there's Isaiah.
[time=1940] The vast difference between the two accentuates the reality of both.
[time=1944] Isaiah, I am damned, he says. I am unworthy. He says, "Woe is me." I think we have pictures of both for you.
[time=1956] I am damned. I am unworthy. Woe is me, judged. Am I?
[time=1962] There's the elevated, lifted up Lord. And now here is Isaiah down at the bottom, sinful, dirty, a man of unclean lips.
[time=1972] From a people of unclean lips, I thought about this this week. Did you ever stop and think why he said lips?
[time=1983] Why, when he's talking about the vast difference between a holy God and people, why he says, "I speak badly."
[time=1998] I think it has to do with the great truth of Matthew 12, 34. I don't know if Isaiah knew this.
[time=2005] I think maybe he did, where it says, "For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the what."
[time=2013] And what we're really getting at here is the great difference between a holy God and a sinful people, not so much just in what they say, but in who we are.
[time=2025] Out of your heart comes the evilness that your lips project. Isaiah here simply saying, simply bemoaning the reality of his sinfulness.
[time=2037] Holiness number two, holiness is seen, the holiness of God in this passage is seen in the threefold declaration where the angel says, "Holy, holy, holy."
[time=2045] It's called the trihagion in the Hebrew. And I want you to understand, it says here in the notes in my Bible, the primary thrust.
[time=2054] Of the threefold repetition of God's holiness, holy, holy, holy, is to emphasize God's great separateness from an independence of his fallen, his separateness from an independence from his fallen creation.
[time=2073] God is separating himself. We see a picture here of God completely and absolutely as Steve described over here.
[time=2082] Secondarily, the holy, holy, holy, some scholars will tell you have to do with the fact that God is how many in one. God is three in one, so you have holy God, holy Son, holy spirit.
[time=2096] Either way, an amazing and powerful phrase that reminds us, and the quote is right there. He's not more holy then.
[time=2105] It's not just that he's more holy, no, he is incomparably and supremely holy, holy, holy. Third point I want you to write down, his holiness, God's holiness is seen in the literal power of his holiness.
[time=2120] The literal physical power, the reaction in the room, they're smoke. It's on fire because of his presence.
[time=2136] The thresholds, the foundations of the room, it's like earthquake-ish. In his presence, there is a literal physical reaction to the holiness of God.
[time=2149] We see things like this also in Revelation 4. Steve's going to show you a few things in that passage right now.
[time=2156] Isaiah 6 and Revelation 4 are both throne-room scenes, and they're really the go-to places in the Old and New Testaments for discussions about the holiness of God.
[time=2168] Revelation 4, let's read verses 8 through 11 together of that passage.
[time=2175] Wiping in is something that's surpassingly wonderful here, so forgive me for not talking about everything that we see.
[time=2183] Verse 8, Revelation 4, "The four living creatures give glory," excuse me, "each of them with six wings are out full of eyes all around him within, and day and night they never cease to say holy, holy, holy is the Lord God almighty who was and is and is to come."
[time=2202] And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever, the 24 elders, you saw a picture of them a minute ago,
[time=2211] fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever.
[time=2219] They cast their crowns before the throne saying, "Worthy are you, our Lord and God to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created."
[time=2238] Three things to say about God's holiness in Revelation 4, the first thing to say is this, the God's holiness, this is overwhelming.
[time=2246] God's holiness is the eternal focus of all creation.
[time=2252] The four living creatures there in Revelation 4 represent probably all of the created order.
[time=2258] They have wings and faces and stuff, I think representing all of creation and all of creation united in this declaration of God's worthiness and his honor and his glory.
[time=2270] Revelation 4 is the first vision that John sees after dealing with the churches in the first three chapters.
[time=2277] Then Revelation 4, he's up in the spirit and he sees a vision of one sitting on a throne whose appearance is like Jasper and Carnelian, brownish red gemstones.
[time=2288] He can't even describe that person just what the appearance was like.
[time=2292] I think John's just grabbing for words, the most beautiful things he's ever seen, that's what he uses.
[time=2298] It's an amazing description.
[time=2300] The elders are dressed in white and they're wearing crowns, you saw what they do with those crowns, in the passage.
[time=2306] Elders and living creatures, they never stop saying this song, this refrain.
[time=2313] They call one to another, like in Isaiah 6, they're calling back and forth, holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.
[time=2324] They cannot stop and never will proclaiming God's awesome holiness, his absolute power and his perfection.
[time=2333] Second thing to say is this, just to repeat what Kelly said a minute ago, because it's very much in Isaiah 6 and Revelation 4,
[time=2340] that God's holiness is an expression of his power.
[time=2343] It is his moral purity and his moral blamelessness, yes, but it's also about his power.
[time=2349] Whenever there are holiness discussions, God's power seems to be showing up quite a bit.
[time=2354] There are other characters in John's vision, but they aren't the focus of the narrative.
[time=2360] They all fall down on their faces, they all cast their crowns, they all sing songs as odes and celebrations of God's power,
[time=2369] and they will never ever stop doing it.
[time=2373] They're full of eyes, do you see that?
[time=2375] All around and within, representing God's omniscience.
[time=2380] And the result of that all knowingness, full of eyes all over the place, is to express praise to him for what he's done.
[time=2389] That's the result of it.
[time=2390] Look at verse 9, excuse me, verse 8.
[time=2394] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.
[time=2397] I was listening to our time together from 2009, talking about the wedding feast of the Lamb.
[time=2403] Do you remember that in the closing hours of 2009?
[time=2407] And in Revelation 19, there's that word, again, Almighty.
[time=2411] And the Greek word is my favorite Greek word of the day.
[time=2415] It's Pentecratore.
[time=2417] That's the Greek word for Almighty.
[time=2419] And it means the one who holds sway over all things.
[time=2424] Ruler of all, Pentecratore.
[time=2427] It's a very big word, not a small word.
[time=2430] So God's holiness is an expression of his power and his station as the Almighty, the one who has all might.
[time=2439] As we sang just a few minutes ago, lastly, number three.
[time=2446] God's holiness prompts the giving of glory and honor and thanks.
[time=2454] Look at verse 9 with me.
[time=2457] Remember the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever.
[time=2464] The elders fall down and they cast their crowns before the throne and they say this.
[time=2469] Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power because God created all things and they exist by his will and by that will they were created.
[time=2481] Those crowns that they have are just gifts.
[time=2484] They're not the focus of the story.
[time=2486] It's interesting that whenever the four living creatures do that, they call these things out, which is forever and ever all the time.
[time=2494] The elders burst into song about God's worthiness.
[time=2498] It's like this beautiful sort of never-ending time of worship.
[time=2503] You felt in worship when there are eight guys on stage singing and harmonies, certainly, yes, then.
[time=2509] Other times, so you kind of feel your feet coming up off the ground.
[time=2513] This is the sense of that to times 1,000, 100 million gajillion.
[time=2519] There is no way to ever possibly explain it.
[time=2522] No eye has seen, no ear has heard what God has in store for those who love them.
[time=2526] And that's what we're looking at here.
[time=2529] This is their response.
[time=2531] I'm just wondering, Kelly, as we move toward that for us, we're going to join in with them at some point, but there's already not yet to this too.
[time=2540] Joining in with giving God glory and honor and thanks is an already thing for us to be doing.
[time=2546] In response to my sin that God is so holy and so awesome and so powerful, and that He loves me, that should prompt us to act like them.
[time=2555] Now, then certainly, but I think already too.
[time=2559] That's good.
[time=2560] So there's like 10 minutes of the holiness of God, and I hope you get the picture.
[time=2567] I hope you're getting close to the idea.
[time=2570] And here's what I want you to say.
[time=2572] What I want you to say is this.
[time=2574] I want you to, having seen us describe from the Scriptures the great pristine, powerful, majestic, pure holiness of God, then I want you to go back to the last two weeks are all sins the same, my sin, how I view my sin.
[time=2590] What I want you to say in light of what we've just said is this, so what?
[time=2596] I want you to say it, go ahead.
[time=2597] So what?
[time=2598] Thank you.
[time=2599] So what?
[time=2600] And that's a great question because this has all got to make sense.
[time=2604] I mean, we've got to apply this.
[time=2606] I want you to see the so what?
[time=2610] That with a holy God whose presence and whose might and whose power and whose majesty is clearly seen,
[time=2618] there is a response that is demanded from us as we in our sinfulness with all of our sins being the same because they're heinous violations of the perfect character of God.
[time=2633] As you look at your sin, as you deal with your sin, as we think about sin, we have to now think about it in light of the holiness of God.
[time=2644] That's the so what?
[time=2645] We can't talk about sin.
[time=2647] You can't think about fight or give attention to the battle with sin without now thinking about it in light of his holiness.
[time=2656] There's three things I want to show you real quick, and then we're going to go.
[time=2660] The holiness of God matters in the discussion about sin.
[time=2665] The holiness of God matters in the discussion about sin. Turn to 1 Peter 1 quickly. Turn to 1 Peter 1, and I want you to look at verses 14 to 16.
[time=2677] 1 Peter 1 verses 14 to 16.
[time=2683] The number one reason that the holiness of God matters in the discussion or teaching about sin is that sinful choosing is not consistent with our new identity.
[time=2699] It's not who we are. Steve, read verses 14 to 16 and then talk a little bit about this identity that we have.
[time=2708] 1 Peter 1, 14 to 16.
[time=2710] As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance.
[time=2716] But as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct.
[time=2723] Since it is written, you shall be holy for I am holy. Leviticus chapter 11.
[time=2731] It's not with my new nature. It's not consistent with that.
[time=2735] My son looks like me. Poor kid.
[time=2741] He walks like you.
[time=2744] I don't know. He does.
[time=2746] He's doomed to sameness, I think, for me.
[time=2750] In the same way, friends, you and I, as obedient children, are called to take on characteristics and some of that happens very naturally without even trying.
[time=2762] Some of it, there is a fight to be fought.
[time=2765] Verse 13 talks about being sober minded and preparing your minds for action.
[time=2770] It's a sense of getting ready for a fight.
[time=2773] But it's not consistent with my new nature in Christ to continue in sin.
[time=2778] Romans, shall I keep sinning so graceful abound? No.
[time=2782] By no means. Strongest possible negative in the Greek language is used by Paul there in Romans.
[time=2790] The passions of your former ignorance.
[time=2794] And friends, what the octet was singing this morning about everything good and right and worthy, we can do that.
[time=2802] Not in and of myself. Left in myself. I can't. But that's not where Paul goes.
[time=2806] Paul says, you be holy because he's holy.
[time=2810] Don't just go out and be holy. Just try the best you can in light of God's holiness.
[time=2815] And the communication of the spirit and the forgiveness spirit who is living himself out through us day by day, we can be holy in all that we do.
[time=2824] It is possible to do it. Don't think it's not.
[time=2828] If you think it's not, you're forgetting who God is.
[time=2832] Talked about forgetting last week. More on that in a minute.
[time=2835] But the sense, Kelly, in which our identity as children of God is lived out as we begin to take on his characteristics that we can, his goodness and his faithfulness.
[time=2847] We'll look like our dad. We will. Our spiritual dad.
[time=2850] New identity. Absolutely. Interesting. In some of the conversations I've had over the years with our friends at New Life Home Trust over in Nairobi.
[time=2859] The orphanage that we're in partnership with there, they rescue babies.
[time=2866] Most often babies. There are times when they'll get a toddler.
[time=2870] There are times when they'll get one three, four, five years of age every once in a while.
[time=2875] It's interesting to hear them talk about how when they get one who's been out living in whatever they've been living in.
[time=2883] They give them clothes. They give them shoes. They dress them.
[time=2888] And they do their hair. You know what I mean? And it's interesting.
[time=2891] They'll talk about how early on, night after night, they'll come back into the room in the morning and all the clothes are off because they have no idea what to do with them.
[time=2901] They're not used to them. Their identity has been for years. Poor, starving, naked, homeless.
[time=2907] And the clothes just don't seem to make sense. And they have to help them understand their new identity.
[time=2913] This is who you are now. You are clothed. And sometimes you and I need to be reminded of who we really are.
[time=2921] Second thing I want you to see here. Sinful choosing leads to the fear of God.
[time=2925] My friends, the holiness of God should be in the sin discussion because sinful choosing should lead you to the fear of God.
[time=2936] Look what it says in verse 17. It says if you address as father the one who impartially judges according to each one's work that ought to get your attention.
[time=2951] Conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth.
[time=2956] I'll just read this to you. The holiness of God should evoke fear when considered up and against our sin.
[time=2963] Fear of God, a genuine, coming, undone, a healthy, real fear of a great father's discipline and great displeasure.
[time=2974] I think that I heard a teaching this week on video. I watched it. I agree with what I heard this week and that is that we have done you.
[time=2983] Oftentimes I think a great disservice and that we've taught you over the years to think about the fear of God as some kind of benign, almost just middle of the road, healthy respect, we say.
[time=2999] I've said that to you at times. We've taught people in the church for years that it's just kind of a being in awe.
[time=3009] Whoa. And I really think that we've done you a disservice and I really want to try in the years to come to help kind of right that wrong.
[time=3020] I believe, Stephen I believe, that as it relates to your sin and ours and as that relates to a holy God who we've been called to live in intimacy with, you should be afraid in a healthy way.
[time=3037] But nonetheless, there is a healthy fear.
[time=3040] And when you read the Bible and you look at the people who came in contact with him, just do it.
[time=3046] Read the Bible and look at the scenes when people came in contact with him. It wasn't, whoa.
[time=3054] It wasn't a healthy respect. It was just, it was undone. It was, oh my goodness.
[time=3062] There is that, what did the quote say there? A great father's discipline and great displeasure when that's coming your way from one who loves you as much as he does.
[time=3074] That might get serious because he loves you that much and he's against sin that much.
[time=3080] And so please, forget the healthy respect thing.
[time=3083] In a very healthy way, fear him. It's what the holiness of God should evoke in us.
[time=3089] And lastly, Steve, as Corbin and the guys are coming, let Steve finish up here.
[time=3093] Both Isaiah and John in Revelation both had that strong reaction.
[time=3097] Yeah.
[time=3098] John falls at his feet as though dead.
[time=3100] The first word of verse 18 guys is, is knowing.
[time=3103] We have a tendency to forget.
[time=3105] We forget and we disregard this precious blood of Christ to shut in our, that's why we're supposed to be fearful.
[time=3112] Because what's been shut in our behalf is the precious blood of Christ, which is able to make you holy,
[time=3118] save you from sin and to a life that's free and full.
[time=3122] That's his design for us.
[time=3124] Knowing is important because we're prone to forget.
[time=3127] We're prone to forget.
[time=3128] We're prone to say maybe it wasn't that big of a deal and it is.
[time=3133] Fearfulness is important.
[time=3135] It's a huge, it's a huge deal.
[time=3138] Hey, I want to just remind you as we close here, there's a verse in Isaiah 6 that I didn't read,
[time=3144] but it is a powerful verse and it really brings some insight to that picture.
[time=3149] In verse 6 after Isaiah says, whoa, whoa, is me.
[time=3154] This man of unclean lips.
[time=3155] Do you remember what God does?
[time=3156] He sends the angel with the burning coal.
[time=3160] Remember?
[time=3161] And the angel does what?
[time=3162] The angel takes that burning coal and he touches Isaiah's mouth.
[time=3168] And that's this picture of God purifying this lowly, sinful, dirty man whose lips and heart are not clean.
[time=3178] God touches him in the very same way that God touched you and touched me when he redeemed us,
[time=3186] giving us this privileged relationship with a holy God.
[time=3190] And so the guys are going to sing about that this morning and I hope it is a great reminder of what we've seen and a great encouragement to you.
[time=3197] Hang on, I'm going to come back in a few minutes, but let's hear these guys and we're going to join them in just a minute.
[time=3227] Then the hand of Jesus touched me, and now I am no longer the same.
[time=3256] He touched me, oh, he touched me, and all the joy that was my soul.
[time=3277] Something happened, and now I know he touched me, and then it would be you.
[time=3297] Since I met this blessed Savior,
[time=3307] since he cleansed and made me whole.
[time=3317] I remember to sing to praise him to praise him.
[time=3326] I'll shout it while he turns the road.
[time=3334] Oh, he touched me, oh, he touched me.
[time=3343] He touched me, and all the joy that was my soul.
[time=3355] Something happened, and now I know he touched me, and then it would be you.
[time=3385] Hey, would you bow your heads and just close your eyes, please, for a moment here.
[time=3392] I want to just encourage anybody in the room this morning, any of you watching on the broadcast today,
[time=3399] if in these minutes here together this morning or even in these last couple of weeks as we've taught about sin,
[time=3406] if the reality is that you come to this place today, here in this time, in this moment, and you know that your sin still today leaves you separated from a holy God.
[time=3420] And maybe you've seen and since in the last couple of weeks and certainly today that this great holy God loves you,
[time=3427] wants to forgive you of all of that sin, make your heart and your life right, he wants to redeem you,
[time=3435] give you hope and a promise for a meaningful today and for all of eternity.
[time=3442] I want to just invite you to just say these words in the quietness of your heart.
[time=3449] Right now, oh Father in heaven, I know my sin separates me from you and oh Father in heaven, holy God,
[time=3459] I confess my sin to you here in this moment and I ask that the work of your Son would serve as the forgiveness and the covering for my sin.
[time=3472] Just say those words, say oh God in heaven, would you not only forgive me now but would you also grow me in this relationship with you?
[time=3482] Would you give me strength? Would you give me friendships? Would you give me support?
[time=3486] The love of a family like Black Hawk where I can understand day by day all that you've called me to be.
[time=3496] The word of God says that when you say those things, when you mean them from your heart that you're saved.
[time=3503] And so Father, we thank you in advance for those who you have saved here in these moments.
[time=3510] And Church, let me just say to you with your heads bowed and your eyes closed if there's anybody in the room that just needs an elder or a staff member,
[time=3518] one of our shepherds to just pray with you this morning, we'll be down here at the end.
[time=3522] We can pray with you, we can encourage you as best we can. We know the fight against sin is a hard one and we want to do our best to walk with you through it.
[time=3532] And so Father, we give all this to you, we thank you for the privilege of worship this morning, the privilege of opening your word.
[time=3540] We look forward to what you'll have for us in the days to come and everybody agreed with the prayer and said amen.
[time=3547] He touched me, and all He touched me, and all His joy bethless my soul.
[time=3567] Something happened, and I hope He's a tree that made me you.
[time=3586] Oh, oh He touched me, oh He touched me.
