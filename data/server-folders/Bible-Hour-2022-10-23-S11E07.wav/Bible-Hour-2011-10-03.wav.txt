[time=30] [MUSIC - 188 seconds]
[time=228] Sing it again, give him glory.
[time=230] [MUSIC - 122 seconds]
[time=366] Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=369] We are so thankful that you've joined us again.
[time=371] And as you can tell, I'm joined today by two really good friends.
[time=375] Guys, I'm so thankful for who helped me and partner with us in the ministry here at Black Hawk.
[time=380] I want you to welcome Rod Obit and Jesus Escabato.
[time=384] And we're here today to kind of continue to tell you the unfolding and very exciting story of Lagos Institute of Biblical Studies.
[time=393] Rod and his wife Carolyn are the founders of Lagos.
[time=398] And that is a part of our ministry here.
[time=401] I have the privilege of serving on their board.
[time=404] This has an exciting opportunity that we want to tell you about.
[time=407] But before we get to Jesus and this new development with Lagos, Rod, give him just a real brief snapshot of what Lagos is for those who don't know.
[time=417] And then just talk briefly about where we're seeing Lagos now expanding to in our region.
[time=422] Okay, Lagos pretty much is now rolling.
[time=427] We're about a year old.
[time=429] And students are re-signing up for classes.
[time=432] We're at a good transition right now starting a new quarter.
[time=435] So it's a great time to jump in.
[time=437] We're located at a number of places throughout the geography of Fort Wayne.
[time=442] So on Monday nights, we're up in Auburn at Lakewood.
[time=446] And all evening classes are at six o'clock to seven thirty, then seven thirty to nine.
[time=454] And so are Lakewood on Mondays.
[time=456] Tuesday we're over at the chapel that covers the southwest.
[time=459] Wednesdays we're here at Blackhawk.
[time=461] Thursday we're at a Brookside which covers a little bit of the north.
[time=466] And then on Saturday we're at greater progressive downtown and we have a great time.
[time=471] Saturday is at nine o'clock to ten thirty, ten thirty to twelve.
[time=476] Awesome, awesome.
[time=478] Lagos, Institute of Biblical Studies.
[time=480] We've always believed at Blackhawk in the great truth of God's Word and the life-changing capacity of its doctrine.
[time=488] I think sometimes doctrine and study and theology have scared people off.
[time=493] We want to take it with Lagos and make it something that you can get your arms around.
[time=497] Understand and apply.
[time=499] And so the work that's going on with Lagos is amazing.
[time=502] Jesus Escabato, who is a part of our family here, does translation every week for our worship services here at Blackhawk, is now partnering with Rod and Carolyn.
[time=513] And I'm so excited, Jesus is going to be able to now teach and facilitate our first Spanish-speaking Lagos opportunity.
[time=522] What's the class going to be, Jesus, that you're going to be starting off with?
[time=526] It will be a New Testament survey beginning on October 13th at one of the locations
[time=532] which we'll shortly let you know about.
[time=534] Yeah, now those locations are going to be southeast Rod.
[time=537] Well, there's going to be two.
[time=538] On Tuesdays we're going to be here at Blackhawk, actually.
[time=542] Tuesday night, 630 at Blackhawk.
[time=545] On Thursday nights, there'll be down south.
[time=547] If you were to take 27 all the way out to where it hits Anthony near Southtown, building there a church called Liquid Church.
[time=555] Yeah.
[time=556] And that's where they'll be located at 630 there.
[time=558] Awesome.
[time=559] So Tuesday nights, a new Spanish-speaking Lagos opportunity here.
[time=562] Absolutely.
[time=563] Thursday nights down at Liquid Church Southeast.
[time=565] We'll give you more information about that site in just a minute.
[time=568] But hey, Susan, do me a favor.
[time=570] And just say what we just said about the new Spanish-speaking opportunities in Spanish.
[time=577] Well, I praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ to borrow a phrase from the New Testament, Peter, and then Paul.
[time=584] Blessed be the Lord Jesus Christ because of this great opportunity has given us great mercy
[time=590] and a great salvation.
[time=591] So now, as His disciples, we need to mature.
[time=595] And this is a great opportunity for the Spanish community to really get into the Word of God
[time=601] and begin to get that doctrine which in our considered opinion and experience they don't always get.
[time=608] So as you said a while back, Pastor Kelly, disciples need doctrine.
[time=613] Not just the Spanish community, but each community.
[time=617] But I get this privilege and it's a dream come true for me to be able to do this for the Spanish community.
[time=624] And I just praise God that He's used Rod and Carolyn and yourself to bring this about.
[time=630] We're excited.
[time=631] Say something in Spanish that kind of invites our Spanish-speaking friends to understand better the opportunity.
[time=637] And it's a great opportunity for me to be able to do this for the first time.
[time=646] And this is a great opportunity for me to be able to do this for the Spanish community.
[time=653] And it's a great opportunity for me to be able to do this for the first time.
[time=660] Thank you.
[time=667] Awesome.
[time=668] You know, praise God.
[time=669] We understand the growing diversity of this community that God has put us in.
[time=673] We're so grateful for all people and want to do our very best to help meet them where they are, encourage them in their faith or introduce them to faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=683] So thank you for tuning in.
[time=685] We're so grateful for what's going on with Logos and so thankful for these guys and their partnership.
[time=690] Hey, as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=692] God bless you.
[time=693] Have a great week.
[time=715] [MUSIC]

[time=1000] Sing it here.
[time=1001] And I will follow you.
[time=1004] I won't follow you.
[time=1014] [MUSIC]
[time=1019] This morning, let's listen and learn to the Word of God on the topic of spiritual growing.
[time=1025] You turn to first Corinthians, everybody, first Corinthians chapter 13 verse 11.
[time=1031] Paul's letter to the church at Corinth.
[time=1033] We think first Corinthians 13, we think love, the love chapter it is.
[time=1038] But as you move on through the love stuff, you come to verse 11.
[time=1042] Would you all stand in honor of God's Word?
[time=1045] And let me read this to you this morning.
[time=1048] As we begin week one of grow or die.
[time=1052] When I was a child, when I was a child, I used to speak like a child.
[time=1060] I used to think like a child, reason like a child.
[time=1065] When I became a man, Paul says, I did away with childish things.
[time=1073] Something here for us this morning as it relates to your spiritual life and mind.
[time=1080] There is a way that it can look very childish.
[time=1085] And there is a way in which it can seem and be and genuinely achieve maturity.
[time=1093] Let's pray.
[time=1094] Father, as we come to this today, oh, I ask that there would be in me and in every person in this room a
[time=1100] genuineness, God a humility, God a readiness to allow your spirit and your word to not only penetrate but assess where we are on this continuum.
[time=1114] God, you clearly call us as a people to grow in the grace of your knowledge, to grow in our understanding of you, to grow in our understanding and application of your truth.
[time=1124] God, we see that and we will see that today and next week.
[time=1128] But our prayer today is that you would begin even now to help each of us understand steps that must be taken.
[time=1136] God, choices that must be made, help that must be asked for, accountability that must be pursued.
[time=1145] God, whatever it takes, would you help us to be a people who would in light of this truth grow up into the men and women you've called us to be in your son's name we pray.
[time=1156] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=1159] 1 Corinthians 13, 11, the three differences between spiritual little ones or kids, if you will, and grownups.
[time=1167] Did you see the three?
[time=1169] Did you see them there in the text as I read it to you there just a minute ago?
[time=1173] The spiritually immature, the not very grown up, if you will.
[time=1180] Speak, think, and reason, and where it says reason, you really need to, in your mind, just kind of think choosing.
[time=1188] Reason has to do with the choices that we make.
[time=1191] The spiritually immature, speak, think, and reason in a way that evidences the absence of growth.
[time=1197] When I was a child, I did it this way.
[time=1200] Now Paul says I am a man and it looks different.
[time=1205] Let's look at these three things this morning, can we? And let's start with our speech.
[time=1210] Let's start with the consistent pattern, the words that come out of our mouths, the things that we say, the way that we communicate, what comes out through our lips, you know, and I know.
[time=1223] It says a lot about what's going on or not going on spiritually.
[time=1229] Let's look at childish immature speech. I want to just say a couple of things here, and we'll just do this throughout the morning.
[time=1236] We'll look at the child-ish example, then we'll look at a grown-up mature example, and we'll just take all three of these things, our speech, our thoughts, and our choices.
[time=1247] We start with speech. Look at Ephesians, if you will. Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, go to Ephesians chapter 5.
[time=1255] Let me just remind you of what it says here in Ephesians 5, 4, as it relates to the kind of speech that comes out of our mouths.
[time=1264] It says, "And there must be no filthiness." And there must be no filthiness. In Ephesians 4, he has called us to grow up into Christ, and now in Ephesians 5, as he begins to kind of explicitly give us some practical ways in which we can do this.
[time=1283] He says, "Hey, on the speech front, there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse-gesting which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks, talk that is filthy, talk that is silly, talk that is coarse."
[time=1300] Someone said, "This kind of speaking brings out in the open that which God designed to be private.
[time=1312] These three inappropriate sins of the tongue, if you will, include any speech that is obscene and degrading or foolish and dirty, as well as any speech that is suggestive and immoral.
[time=1328] All such parts of speech, all such activity," he says verbally, "is destructive as it relates to holy living and godly character."
[time=1340] We just stood here last week and reminded you and encouraged you and implored you to understand that in your fight, and in our fight against sin, Steve and I stood here together, and we said, "You have got to, we have got to together pursue holiness coming at life and giving ourselves to practices that would emulate
[time=1357] and reflect the God whose holiness gives us that example, and here we learn right away that the words that come out of your mouth, the way in which we speak, can go a great distance in helping us pursue or diminish holiness."
[time=1375] It's interesting, as you look at this, if there's any, there's filthiness, silly talk, coarse-gesting, the passage clearly implies that what's called for are three things.
[time=1388] Number one, it should be confessed.
[time=1391] Number one, you and I need to be a people who are willing, when these things are present, to confess them for what they are, they're sinful, they fall short of God's design for our speech.
[time=1401] There needs to be a willingness in you, and in me to confess this, there needs to be a willingness in you, and in me to forsake it.
[time=1410] We've talked about that to move away from it.
[time=1413] This is the ongoing pattern in your life in mind of moving away, creating distance from patterns, creating distance from habits, asking for help, seeking accountability.
[time=1423] We need to confess that it has happened, and then forsake it, turn our back on it, and move in a different direction.
[time=1432] You say, we're just talking about the words that we speak?
[time=1434] Yeah, the words that we speak, the stuff that we say, and especially those words in that speech that falls into this category of Ephesians 5, where we confess, we forsake, and then thirdly, don't miss this.
[time=1447] Not only do you turn your back on that kind of speech, but then you replace it with speech that is honoring to God.
[time=1454] You replace it with speech that is honoring to people.
[time=1457] You replace it with speech that is pure, not obscene.
[time=1460] You replace it with speech that is uplifting, and not vile.
[time=1465] We confess it, we forsake it, and we replace it.
[time=1470] Childish, immature speech, talk that is filthy, silly, of course.
[time=1475] There's also another component of childish speaking, and that is just real practical, and all you've got to do is just think about little kids.
[time=1485] Think about little ones when they're all together playing, think about little ones in a classroom, think about, I have the joy.
[time=1495] It really is. A great benefit of my job is on my way out of the office or on my way into the office across the street, on my way to lunch or coming back.
[time=1504] So many times I get to walk right through recess.
[time=1509] I get to walk through the playground, and oftentimes there's an enormously selfish motivation because I want to see my kids and give them a hug and see how they're doing.
[time=1518] But it's just interesting, and you've seen it, and you've heard it, and I have too.
[time=1521] You just bump into kids that are playing, and it's not uncommon for you to bump into degrading, diminishing, critical, name-calling.
[time=1533] It's just kind of what kids, it's what childishness looks like when there's tension all of a sudden, you're this.
[time=1541] And you're that, and you're that.
[time=1546] It's just all this kind of gets negative, and it just starts cutting down, and it just starts making fun of, and it just starts pointing out weaknesses, and there's giggling, and there's laughing, and there's childish.
[time=1562] And that's what that kind of speech does.
[time=1566] Childish speech is any speech on the playground at Blackhawk, or in your car, or in your living room, or in your world, wherever, when it tears down, when it diminishes their efforts that are being made, when it deflates their spirit, it's what childish, immature talk does.
[time=1591] Well, what about grown-up talk?
[time=1595] What about mature speech?
[time=1597] Let's go back to Ephesians 5, just go up a verse from 4, where it talked about filthiness, silly talk, and of course, jesting.
[time=1604] And just understand that in the mature world, people have understood the great truth of 5.3, where it says, "But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you."
[time=1618] As is proper among the saints, we've talked about this, not even a hint, not even a sniff of these things.
[time=1624] Here in the verbal world, as we tape record you 24/7, as you and I give an account for what we say, there is in our growth toward maturity, and grown-upness, there is an ever-increasing lack of tearing down,
[time=1646] an ever-increasing lack of diminishing and depleting, and there is a readiness to build up.
[time=1654] There is a readiness and a willingness to encourage, look at 4.29, kind of just stay on the same page probably.
[time=1662] Grown-up, mature speech, Ephesians 4.29, let know and hold some word, proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to those who hear.
[time=1681] My friends, you and I come into these, we walk into these needs of the moment all the time, and in that moment with your kids,
[time=1691] in that moment with those you lead, in that moment with those that you are influencing, in that moment at the gas station, in that moment at the grocery store,
[time=1702] whatever the moment is, when you and I have a chance to speak, and I really do think this is a great passage, it's a great truth for parents, and for those who lead, it calls for maturity, calls for speech that edifies.
[time=1717] I hope you'll write this down. Godly speech edifies, it instructs, Godly speech edifies, it instructs and encourages and is uplifting, even when it must be, what, corrective.
[time=1732] And I know because I know you, and you know because you know me, there are many of us in the room who go, wait a minute, you're saying that when it's time for me to correct,
[time=1741] that my correction, which means something's gone wrong, somebody said something they shouldn't, somebody's done something they shouldn't, and now I'm supposed to correct, and you're saying I can correct in a way that encourages, instructs and uplifts.
[time=1757] And I'm saying to you this morning, yes, yes, this is grown-up talk, this is mature speech, see in our sinfulness, watch this, you know this is true, it's embarrassing for me to stand here and say this because I wish it wasn't this way with me, I know God's growing me in this, I'm thankful, I've seen some progress, but you, many of us are still kind of in this boat.
[time=1783] Well, it says instructs, you see it there? Godly speech edifies, it instructs.
[time=1788] What we want to do in our sinfulness and childishness is we want to demean and belittle.
[time=1796] We get angry, and we get upset, and we lose sight of instruction, and we get stuck on demeaning and belittling, because we get angry, where it says encourage, we want to yell.
[time=1810] Many of us want to raise our voices, many of us out of frustration that this thing is unfolding the way it is, and most of us know it's unfolding that way because we haven't done a good job of teaching.
[time=1821] And we just get angry, and instead of encouraging we yell, we think volume is better than content, and we're shy on content so we just yell.
[time=1833] And edification instructs, it doesn't demean, encourages, it doesn't yell, listen to this, it uplifts, uplift.
[time=1843] In our correction, we can inspire the word says.
[time=1849] But yet what we want to do is we want to criticize.
[time=1854] We just start knocking them down, and with our criticism and our yelling and our demeaning belittling words, we move ourselves right back up to childish.
[time=1869] And God's word saying no, no, no, no, no.
[time=1872] In the need of the moment, edify with your speech, instruct, encourage, and uplift.
[time=1880] Great truth to hang on to, let's go to our thoughts back to 1 Corinthians 13, 11.
[time=1885] We looked at our speech, let's go to our thoughts.
[time=1888] Let's start with childish, immature thinking, and here's how I want to do this.
[time=1892] Go to Ephesians real quick, go over a few pages, kind of a familiar verse, Ephesians 4, 8.
[time=1898] This certainly wouldn't sound childish or immature upon reading it, but I want you to look at this.
[time=1905] Finally, brethren, as it relates to our minds, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute.
[time=1916] If there is any excellence, and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things, this is talking about where we allow our minds to park.
[time=1926] This is talking about where we allow our minds to dwell, and to show you what immature or childish thinking would look like in view of this, I just had him kind of redo the verse.
[time=1941] I don't think he didn't strike me dead first hour, so I'm not messing with Scripture, I just wanted you to see how this would read.
[time=1948] If you look at 4, 8, in the opposite translation, if you will, finally, brethren, whatever is counterfeit or false, whatever is vile, whatever is wrong, whatever is tainted, whatever is unsightly, whatever is corrupt, if there is any imperfection,
[time=1965] and if anything is not worthy of praise, do not dwell on these things.
[time=1972] You may have to interact with these things. Again, this is talking about where you discipline your mind, where you allow it to sit, to dwell, to ponder, to chew, to fantasize, to think.
[time=1988] Don't immature childishness will lead you and me to mentally park in places like this, and he says do not go there.
[time=2002] Grown up mature thinking so many places we could go. I picked a verse that I think I hope will just be appropriate and helpful to as many of you as possible.
[time=2014] I'd like you to turn in your Bibles to 2 Corinthians, chapter 10, verse 5, it's an interesting verse, and packed right in the midst of it is a great, great truth that relates to the way in which, listen, church, the way in which you think,
[time=2029] and the way in which you process your thinking. It's true, the way you process thinking really does matter in your spiritual growth life. Let me read it to you.
[time=2042] It says in 2 Corinthians 10, 5, it says we are destroying speculations. You see that in every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God. Stop right there. That's what the enemy is trying to do with you, young and old alike.
[time=2057] The enemy tries to move you away from the enemy tries to bring battle against those things that represent the knowledge of God. But Paul says no, we are taking every thought, what? Say it out loud.
[time=2072] Captive. What does this mean? We are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ. I really want you to grasp this. Here's what this means.
[time=2089] It means that there is for you and there is for me this responsibility and opportunity. All thoughts are to be seized. Write this down. All thoughts being seized and held up to the light of what is really true.
[time=2106] And what is really true? What's really true is the very word of God. This is where obedience in Christ comes in. So the enemy, you know how it works. The enemy sends you a thought.
[time=2117] The enemy sends me a thought. The enemy is trying to get you and I to with these thoughts and with these temptations, with these scenarios that we can run in our minds. The enemy wants the evil thought to find fertile ground in your feelings.
[time=2134] Because you may not be feeling so good. The enemy wants these evil thoughts to find fertile ground in your humanness, in your fallenness, in your sinfulness. Because you know and I know what happens to evil thoughts that find fertile ground in our humanness.
[time=2153] It doesn't go so well. And so what the word of God says here is, whoa, time out. What you're supposed to do is you're supposed to grab. You're supposed to take captive. You're supposed to seize all these thoughts.
[time=2167] And bring them in captivity. You bring them to the light of God's word. You bring those thoughts to the light of what's really true.
[time=2177] Because what he just sent you isn't true, but you kind of think maybe it might be. But now God says, no, bring it to the truth. Let's shine light on it.
[time=2186] It reminds me, this won't be on the screen. It reminds me of Ephesians 5. Just listen. Ephesians 5, 11, do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them.
[time=2200] For it is graceful, Ephesians 5, 12, for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.
[time=2208] But all things become visible when they are exposed by the what? By the light for everything that becomes visible is light.
[time=2219] Those who are spiritually mature, those of us who are growing toward grown-up-ness understand the enormous power of thoughts.
[time=2232] Thoughts feed and solidify the bent, the leaning of the mind, and the mind will always guide and empower our actions.
[time=2247] That's how it works. It has always worked that way. It works that way today and it always will.
[time=2256] The condition of your mind so affected by the reality of your thoughts. I thought we would just be practical here for a few minutes.
[time=2267] I thought I would just take three thoughts that a number of us in the room today could have.
[time=2277] Three thoughts, three messages, I believe, oftentimes sent by the enemy.
[time=2284] I thought we could just practically work through what I just tried to explain to you, so I hope it works.
[time=2291] Here's a thought that you may just initially ascribe to adolescent girls.
[time=2299] I think it applies to adolescent girls, but I've learned over the years it applies to so many of us.
[time=2306] I'm not pretty. The thought goes. I'm ugly. I'm too fat. I'm not attractive, and I never will be.
[time=2319] This one gets communicated from the enemy to all sorts of young people, older people, single people, married people.
[time=2328] I want you to understand what that's about. That is, there's the words, but what that's really about is that's the cry of one who wonders if they'll ever be loved.
[time=2339] That's the cry of one who wonders if they're ever really going to be seen as valuable.
[time=2345] See, this is the cry of one who's been attacked by the enemy and has developed to some degree, maybe even a strong degree, this notion, that there really isn't much about them at all.
[time=2357] That's beautiful. That's lovely.
[time=2361] What we have to do is we've got to be willing, you, those of you who may struggle with this and others of you who may can help those who struggle with this, we've got to expose the lie of that thought.
[time=2377] And when you bring that thought into the light of God's Word, when you bring that thought into the reality of how God really views you, then you know that you're passionately loved by a loving father in heaven who's affection for you can bring the deepest sense of security and belonging ever imagined.
[time=2400] That's the truth. No matter who you are, what you've endured, what you've seen, what's been said, what's been perpetrated, that is the truth and the Spirit of God and the Word of God and the people of God can help you embrace that instead of that.
[time=2424] Privately, you might think, I'd be better off if I were married to him instead of him.
[time=2438] This could be the very private thought or cry of one. A couple of years in or many years in to a disappointing relationship and marriage that just isn't at all what you hoped and thought it would be.
[time=2456] This could be the disappointed and angry cry of one who's just fed up with the reality of their life. And certainly this could be better off married to him. Certainly it could be I'd be better off married to her.
[time=2472] This is lacking contentment. This is probably filled with hurt. This is a very real thought. And there are times that very real thought moves people down a very real road toward very real destruction.
[time=2490] But nonetheless, that's the thought. And God's Word says, take it captive and go ahead and bring it under the light of his truth. And when you bring that thought under the light of his truth, you realize you'd be better off obeying God.
[time=2508] That's where you'd be better off. You'd be better off obeying God growing in your selfless love for your husband and staying away from who? Him.
[time=2520] Check the stats. Read the stories. It doesn't go so well. It's just not a good road to go down. It's not what God designed. And He designed for you what is best for you.
[time=2536] Take that thought and let the light show you what it really is. It is a lie meant to leave you emaciated and starving and ruined and dead.
[time=2553] My parents are so stupid. I hear an amen from a 15 year old. My parents are so stupid. They deprive me of the life I deserve. They are lame. They're unfair.
[time=2570] And you're sitting there thinking, I can't wait to be on my own. This is a thought that young people will sometimes have. And while the frustration can be maybe understandable, you know what? It might be best.
[time=2588] It might be wise, 12 year old, 16 year old, 17 year old. It might be wise to step away from the cliff and allow the truth, the word of God, to shed some light on this thought. Take that thought captive and what you eventually come to is that while it's true, they may not be the smartest people on the planet.
[time=2611] Moms and dads, go ahead and nod your heads. They have been divinely placed in your life by God Himself to teach you humble obedience and trust in God's ways, not yours.
[time=2625] See young people, it's not about your mom and dad. It is about God and you. And God is simply using them as a conduit through which to teach you what you're going to have to have with God for the rest of your life, which is humble obedience.
[time=2640] When it doesn't make sense and a trust in Him when you want to run the other direction. And when you're 37, it's going to look like this, but when you're 16, it looks like this.
[time=2654] Yes, dad. Okay, mom. I will. I'm sorry.
[time=2666] Taking thoughts, captive, can save your life. It's that important.
[time=2674] Our reasoning, our choices, childless, immature, choosing. Our third point from 1 Corinthians 13. Let me just read this to you. Childless choosing is really all about one thing. It is all about one thing.
[time=2688] Childless choosing is when you whine, throw a fit and complain. And I'm not just talking to six-year-olds. I'm talking to 46-year-olds.
[time=2697] It's when choices get made again and again that are simply and only about you. What you want when you want it your way or heck to pay.
[time=2709] You know. You know. Listen. You know you're in trouble, my friend, when most of your choices benefit you.
[time=2718] When most of your choices, when it's all said and done, just seem to point again and again and again to you and your benefit.
[time=2726] All kinds of selfish choices. I listed a few. There's self-serving choices. You know what self-serving choices are. They are choices that just scream out.
[time=2737] Me first. Self-serving choices are me first. And again, it's not just five-year-olds, it's 35-year-olds. It's not just kids, it's dads. It's not just adolescent girls, it's grandmothers.
[time=2751] Me first. Me first. How can I have the most fun? Now we may be zeroing on adolescents there, but I'll serve myself, then you, maybe.
[time=2768] My needs. My preferences. It's just childish. There's angry choices. Angry choices. I don't like what you just did or said.
[time=2779] And now I am going to make you what? I'm going to make you pay. Are you serious? I'm going to make you pay. How childish can we get?
[time=2797] There's lazy choices. Why should I do what someone else might do? Why should I give myself? Make all the effort for what someone else might do for me.
[time=2809] Why do the full job when doing half the job lets me at least get by? Just getting by. How childish. How young. How short-sighted.
[time=2825] Demanding. Manipulative choices. You know what this is? This is, I don't like my life at all. I'm tired of it. This isn't what I want.
[time=2835] I'm tired of having to put up with it. I'm tired of having to endure it, so I'm going to demand. I am going to manipulate him. I'm going to manipulate her.
[time=2844] I'm going to manipulate them into oblivion if I have to, but I'm going to start getting what I want.
[time=2852] Wining. Complaining. Getting even. Childish. I was thinking about it this week. One of the most childish examples I think in all of scripture when it comes to choices that got made.
[time=2870] Go back to numbers. Do you remember the story? I know most of you do. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers. Go to Numbers 11.
[time=2878] It's all through the first several books of the Old Testament. It is the story of Israel. It's the story of Israel.
[time=2887] And when God saved them out of slavery in where? Where were they in slavery? Egypt. They're in Egypt. They're in Egypt for hundreds of years. And they're for 100, 200, 300, 400 years.
[time=2900] Their daughters are being raped. Their sons are being stolen. Their families are being ruined. They're being physically and emotionally and spiritually abused.
[time=2908] It's some of the darkest, hardest, cruelest stuff you've ever seen. And God rescues them. Oh, does God rescue them?
[time=2916] He rescues them in a miraculous way. And he leads them on the exodus out of Egypt toward the promised land. He's going to bless them and he's going to love them and he's going to make them this great nation.
[time=2929] And he says, all you've got to do is just obey. You've got to follow me and be faithful.
[time=2935] And they've still got Egypt on their sandals and all of a sudden it's just not what it's supposed to be. It's not what they want. It's not what they expected.
[time=2945] They want this and they want that. We come to Numbers and they want what they want. They wanted meat. They were sick of what? They were sick of manna.
[time=2953] God had been providing them food. This manna, this cape type stuff, it probably wasn't that great. But at least they had something to eat.
[time=2960] But they didn't want it. They wanted meat. They wanted meat. They wanted meat. They just kept crying and whining and throwing their fit.
[time=2969] And God said to Moses and Numbers 11, 18, say to the people, it's like he's done.
[time=2976] Tell them, consecrate yourselves for tomorrow and you shall eat meat.
[time=2982] For you have wept in the ears of the Lord saying, oh, they really said this. And here's my point.
[time=2987] Oh, that someone would give us meat to eat. For we were well off in Egypt.
[time=2996] Their sons were murdered. Their daughters were raped. Their families were destroyed for hundreds and hundreds of years.
[time=3003] And they're saying, we were better off with feral. Childish. Short-sighted. Selfish. You shall eat.
[time=3017] Therefore the Lord will give you meat and you shall eat. You shall eat not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days.
[time=3024] But a whole month until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you because you have rejected the Lord who is among you
[time=3032] and have wept before him saying, why did we ever leave Egypt?
[time=3041] Grown up mature choosing is able to, especially in light of Numbers 11, it's able to move away from you.
[time=3051] Grown up mature choosing moves toward who? Others.
[time=3056] This is when you know growth is happening in your life. In the lives of your kids and the lives of your friends, when you see it begin to not be about you but them, Philippians 2.
[time=3070] Philippians 2, I'm going to ask Corbin and telling you to come on up as we close this morning, but let me read this to you.
[time=3076] It's so important that you, that you not miss this. It says in Philippians 2, 3, it says, do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit.
[time=3089] But with humility of mind, that's what we prayed for this morning that you and I would have as we listened to all of this and take all of this in, that you would, with humility of mind, regard one another as more important than you.
[time=3103] Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.
[time=3111] Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus the most grown up person ever, who although he existed in the form of God, he had everything, he didn't regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but he let it go.
[time=3125] And he says to you this morning, let it go. Let your pride and let your arrogance and let your me first go.
[time=3133] He emptied himself, taking the form of a bondservant and being made in the lightness of men.
[time=3141] Remember my friends, God has called you to grow. He has called us to grow, to move from where we are to a new place of not only insight but practice.
[time=3151] Remember, speech that encourages and inspires, thinking that reflects the truth, not lies, choosing that is constantly others centered, her, him, them first.
[time=3170] Grow up and you'll live. Stay young, stay immature and you'll die. And the sad part about that is that as you stay immature and die, you'll usually take a few with you.
[time=3187] And we don't want that. He doesn't want that. Listen, as Tanya reminds us as we close about the one who is for us in this growth journey.
[time=3200] [MUSIC]
[time=3211] So faithful, so constant, so loving and so true, so comfort in all you do, you fill me.
[time=3229] You see me.
[time=3234] When you know my every move and you love me, I've seen to you.
[time=3246] I know that you are for me. I know that you are for me.
[time=3254] I know that you will never forsake me in my weakness. I know that you have come now.
[time=3266] Even if to run my mind, to remind me that I know that you are for me. I know that you will never forsake me in my weakness.
[time=3292] I know that you have come now. Even if to run upon my heart, to remind me who you are.
[time=3323] It's just a good question to maybe leave with today. I was sitting there looking at these accessories, these furniture of the life of a little one.
[time=3338] And you know, there's good memories for me. I know for many of you in some ways when we think about the trappings of infancy.
[time=3349] But if I asked you to come and swing me in that seat, it would immediately become a little ridiculous.
[time=3356] And the point is that for you and for me, there is the great need for us spiritually to move past those days when it was just beginning.
[time=3368] And move instead to a day where the understanding of his truth or the relationship that we have with him, where our willingness to obey and follow him, evidence is maturity and not youth.
[time=3385] And so we're here today not to bang you over the head for being young. We're here to remind you that you've got to grow up.
[time=3393] You've got to take steps. And I'm so grateful that we are providing you on a Sunday morning and on a Thursday night for five weeks in October and November with a growth group.
[time=3405] A chance to serve our community at the end of this month and countless other things that we would love to help you connect with and be a part of. We're here for you.
[time=3416] Would you stand? And I sure hope we'll be back next week as we continue on in a look at the Scriptures and this great principle of spiritual growth.
[time=3427] Let me pray for us as we go. Oh, God, we would admit to you this morning, I think most of us in the room that we know there is great room, space in our hearts and in our lives for growth.
[time=3440] God, we need to move from where we are in our marriages, in our leadership at home, in our relationship with our parents and the way we conduct ourselves at work and the things that we say and the stuff that we think, the choices that we make.
[time=3460] Oh, God, we lay ourselves before you today and just ask that in the days to come, maybe as many even come to the digging deeper resource midweek and they continue to think about and study and interact with the message from this morning.
[time=3477] Oh, God, please develop. Oh, God, please grow us. We pray in your precious son's name. Amen.
