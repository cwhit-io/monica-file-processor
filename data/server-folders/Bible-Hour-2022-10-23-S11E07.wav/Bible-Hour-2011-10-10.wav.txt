[time=492] (audience applauding) - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=499] My name's Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Black Hawk, and we have the privilege of coming to you week after week, hopefully encouraging you and teaching you the great life-changing truth of God's Word, and also getting a few minutes like this to share with you things that are going on in our ministry, things that we want you to know about, things we want you to be involved in, and I can't wait for October 22nd.
[time=524] I wanna tell you about this this morning so that you can take advantage of what is going to be a really, really amazing day.
[time=531] We're calling it our big serve.
[time=533] That's right, we believe one of the great callings that God has placed on the church is to be a place, to be a people that go into our community and neighborhood and serve.
[time=544] It's what Jesus did.
[time=545] Jesus met the real everyday physical needs that people had, and in the meeting of those needs, He communicated the love of God.
[time=554] And so we wanna do the same thing, October 22nd, from nine to noon, Black Hawk, as a family, all of us are gonna gather that day and go out into our community to do work projects, to serve people who have needs in their home, to do leaf raking, to do painting, to do cleanup, whatever we can do to help on a Saturday morning, we want to do that.
[time=576] So here's what I want you to know.
[time=578] We'd love to come help meet your need.
[time=580] Whatever need you might have, or you may have a mother or father, you may have some relatives, you may know of someone on your block where you live that could use some help.
[time=589] We want you to contact us.
[time=591] I want you to call the church office, and I want you to contact Laura Cox, her name, her number, her extension, her email, is all right here on the screen.
[time=601] Call in to the church, talk to Laura, shoot her an email, let her know who you are, what the need is, the address, you'll get all that information from you, and we'll be able to come and help meet some needs in a real tangible way.
[time=615] We love where God has put us in this community of ours, and we can't wait to serve.
[time=620] In a big way, everyone that God brings across our path.
[time=625] And so we hope to see you on that Saturday.
[time=627] We are so thankful for the chance to reach out and serve in this way, and can't wait to see what God's gonna do with these efforts.
[time=635] Contact us, let us know of a need.
[time=637] We want to come and serve and meet that need.
[time=640] Thank you so much for tuning in today.
[time=642] God bless you, and as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=842] [MUSIC]
[time=869] (upbeat music)
[time=929] [MUSIC - 23 seconds]
[time=956] (upbeat music) - Well, you know, we believe here at Black Hawk
[time=969] that growing churches are filled with growing people.
[time=974] That's how we believe that works.
[time=976] And so we've come again as we do each fall to a two-week stretch where we entitle our teaching, grow or die.
[time=983] And the way we do this in the fall and the way we do this in the spring is that we go two weeks of grow or die teaching, highlighting and emphasizing the great priority of spiritual growing in your life and mind.
[time=997] And then on that Thursday night following the second Sunday, which is this coming Thursday night, we begin what we call five weeks of grow groups.
[time=1006] Five weeks of a wonderful opportunity for every one of you here in this room to come and connect with a small group of people who are going to be over these five weeks, delving into things that will help grow and stretch and develop their faith.
[time=1020] And we would love for you to be a part of this with them.
[time=1024] I showed you last week four of the eight teachers, leaders that we've got.
[time=1029] Steve Webster has done a phenomenal job of putting together our faculty for the five weeks.
[time=1034] I want you to watch the screens, if you will here, this morning as you see the other four, what great opportunities God has for you watch and be encouraged as we look at grow groups.
[time=1045] (upbeat music) - Most of us are familiar with Jesus teaching us
[time=1060] through the gospels on the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1063] But what we find in Acts 1-3 is that Jesus spent 40 days with the disciples speaking about the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1070] And so what we want to explore is where do we fit into the kingdom of heaven on earth.
[time=1073] We're going to explore a mission, doing justice in Jesus' making of all things new.
[time=1078] This course is going to review the scriptural foundations for Jesus' ministry on earth, which continues today through his body, the church.
[time=1085] We'll invite God's spirit to empower us to bring his love and presence to our settings.
[time=1090] If you struggle with how you fit into the church's calling and mission, this course is for you.
[time=1095] (upbeat music)
[time=1102] It seems as though no biblical doctrine is under fire these days as much as the doctrine of hell.
[time=1107] And so in response to that, we're going to take a five-week journey through Francis Chan's most recent book, Erasing Hell.
[time=1114] We simply can't afford to be wrong on that issue.
[time=1116] There's way, way too much at stake.
[time=1118] So join us as we consider what the Bible has to say by eternity, both with and without God.
[time=1124] (upbeat music)
[time=1130] What this class is about is for those that want a deeper personal Bible study.
[time=1135] The fancy name is Hermeneutics, but what we're actually doing is providing to students the tools, the wherewithal that they can go deeper into the word, we'll be providing lists of websites, software, we'll be showing books.
[time=1151] We'll be going through some of those tools and how to use them and how to scratch deeper than the surface.
[time=1158] In the, after a couple of weeks of studying how to do it, we'll actually have hands-on where we'll be going into scriptures, looking at the original language, what some of the words meant.
[time=1168] We'll look at the context, some of the historical value.
[time=1172] And our promise to any student that joins is that they will come out with a deeper appreciation and value of the word of God.
[time=1179] (upbeat music)
[time=1186] The nature of sin left unchecked is to destroy.
[time=1190] Sin cuts us off from others and ultimately from the God who created us.
[time=1195] So working through Brian Hedge's book, License to Kill, will be reminded of the importance of fighting the sin that Hebrews says so easily and tangles us and robs us of our freedom.
[time=1207] So would you please join us for practical instruction on both stalking and killing sin.
[time=1216] I love that phrase that Josh just used there, stalking sin.
[time=1221] Did you ever think of it that way?
[time=1223] Most of the time we don't.
[time=1224] Most of the time we think about just enduring the onslaught of it and here we get teaching and encouragement and you will in that group with Josh on how to actually go after it and to do battle against it in an effective God-honoring way.
[time=1241] Hey, for those of you that are watching on the broadcast right now, you just saw that video and even though you're watching this a week late, you can still come.
[time=1251] If you're watching in the Bible Hour viewing audience, still come on a Thursday night.
[time=1255] Doesn't matter if you're a week late.
[time=1256] We'd love to have you and we hope one of those classes is something that would really speak to you, encourage you in your spiritual journey with the Lord.
[time=1265] Hey, my friends, spiritual growth.
[time=1267] Let me just say something to you before we move on this morning.
[time=1270] Spiritual growth.
[time=1273] Last week we looked at 1 Corinthians 13, 11.
[time=1276] Last week we learned Paul taught us that there is a way that we can grow up in our faith.
[time=1282] There is a way in which we can mature in our relationship with Christ where we can begin to move from childish speaking and childish thinking and childish reasoning or decision making.
[time=1298] We learned last week that in the process of spiritual growing, we can mature.
[time=1303] We can leave certain things behind.
[time=1305] And as I've talked with many of you this week as I've gotten emails and texts and heard hallway conversations, I know there is a great desire in many of you to grow.
[time=1317] I know because I know you.
[time=1319] I know because of our relationship here in this place.
[time=1323] I know that there is the hope in many of your lives.
[time=1326] You would love to be able to move from here to there.
[time=1329] You would love to not stay where you are.
[time=1332] You desire spiritual growth.
[time=1334] But I want to remind you of something this morning before we move on.
[time=1338] This just came to me as the week went by.
[time=1340] I just felt prompted to bring this to your attention.
[time=1343] So I'm going to try and do it in a brief way, but I think it's important that we at least stop and consider this.
[time=1347] There is no possibility at all for personal spiritual growth of any kind without the sustained work of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1360] I just want to make sure that you read that and that you understand it and that you're willing to cooperate with God if you will on this idea of growth.
[time=1371] There is no possibility at all for you.
[time=1374] You will not grow spiritually.
[time=1379] Outside of the sustained work of the Holy Spirit, to spiritually leave childish things behind the first Corinthians 13, 11, to grow up into Him, Ephesians 4, 14, and 15, we looked at those last week.
[time=1394] For you to grow up and mature into all that God has designed you to be requires the regular ongoing work and activity of the Spirit of God in your heart and soul.
[time=1403] Without it, you will never grow or develop spiritually.
[time=1408] Understand this.
[time=1409] For some of you, this is a quick review.
[time=1411] For others of you, it might be new learning.
[time=1413] So here, let me just give you some things to consider.
[time=1416] You may even want to write this down.
[time=1418] The Holy Spirit.
[time=1420] See, I think we've done the Holy Spirit quite a disservice because we get a little freaked out about the Holy Spirit.
[time=1427] We hear all kinds of things that get connected to the Holy Spirit.
[time=1431] We see people doing things under the banner of the Holy Spirit that sometimes frankly scare us.
[time=1437] And so I think a lot of times over the years in the church, we just said, look, we're going to leave the Holy Spirit over here.
[time=1444] You ought to pick up Francis Chan's book, Forgotten God.
[time=1448] Forgotten God, it's about the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1452] It's a phenomenal, phenomenal read.
[time=1455] Let me remind you of this.
[time=1456] And as you hear this today, think about spiritual growing, which is what we're talking about here and the centrality, the absolute necessity of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1470] As you hear this, the Holy Spirit, God's word teaches us, the Holy Spirit indwells us.
[time=1476] At the point where you placed your faith in Jesus Christ, when you came to faith in Him, the scriptures teach that God gave the Holy Spirit to you.
[time=1486] He takes up residence literally in your heart and soul and life.
[time=1492] The Holy Spirit sanctifies us, sanctifies.
[time=1495] It's kind of a big word, but what it means is the process of making you, molding you, chiseling you, working us in this process of developing us to be more like Christ.
[time=1508] It is the Holy Spirit of God who sanctifies us and makes us in time more and more like our Lord.
[time=1517] That's the Spirit of God doing that.
[time=1519] The Holy Spirit instructs us.
[time=1525] You think I instruct you.
[time=1528] You're under the misnomer, maybe the Bible instructs you.
[time=1531] While I try and provide a mouthpiece for the truth and while the Scripture certainly is our authoritative truth and guide, it is the Spirit of God that has indwelled you that instructs you, that helps you understand and see it.
[time=1550] He is the great communicator of the truth in your life and mind.
[time=1554] Think you need Him for growth.
[time=1559] And so far, it's starting to make sense.
[time=1562] The Holy Spirit indwells, sanctifies and instructs, empowers us for service.
[time=1568] Do you understand this?
[time=1569] The Holy Spirit, God's word tells us that spiritual gifts are given to those who believe and as we use those gifts, the Spirit of God empowers those gifts to do their work.
[time=1585] I got a gift of leading and teaching.
[time=1587] You got a gift of helping.
[time=1589] You got a gift of encouraging.
[time=1591] You got the gift of administration.
[time=1593] You have this gift.
[time=1594] You've got that gift.
[time=1595] All these gifts that the New Testament teaches us, you've been given, I've been given it as we use down the Spirit of God empowers us.
[time=1604] And those works become, they become divine, they become powerful, they become effective.
[time=1613] Anybody can do good things.
[time=1616] But when the body of Christ engages in the work of the Spirit using the gifts, the Spirit of God has endowed, oh my goodness, amazing things happen.
[time=1625] Spirit of God convicts us of our sin.
[time=1630] Try even thinking about growing without being able to deal with your sin.
[time=1640] It's the Spirit of God that brings that sense of, oh no, no, no, no, you don't go there.
[time=1648] It's the Spirit of God that brings that sense of, you've crossed, you've crossed over the line.
[time=1652] It's the Spirit of God that convicts us of our sin.
[time=1656] It's the Spirit of God that leads us to repentance.
[time=1659] Look what the Spirit of God does.
[time=1663] It's the Spirit of God that illumines the word, illumines, it's a big word.
[time=1669] Really simple though, it means to illuminate, it means to shed light on when I'm reading to my youngest daughter and I say a big word and she says, "Dad, what's that mean?" And I explain to her what that word means.
[time=1683] I've illumined it, the Spirit of God, and you illumines this and helps us get it.
[time=1690] Without it, without the Spirit of God,
[time=1697] you'll never, ever grow spiritually.
[time=1702] So why am I telling you this?
[time=1703] Why am I taking all this time?
[time=1705] You might think it's a given.
[time=1707] You might think that everyone in this room knows this, that all of us are dialed in here on this point, but let me just say it as plainly as I can because 24, 25 years of doing this has taught me that what you might assume or what I might assume is usually not the case, that there are probably many in this room who need to be reminded of this, maybe even some of you watching on the broadcast who never have wrestled with this.
[time=1739] So I'm gonna just say it very plainly.
[time=1741] Number one, I've already said it, the Holy Spirit is central, absolutely necessary for spiritual growth.
[time=1747] Now listen, the Holy Spirit is only present.
[time=1753] In those who have fully embraced the truth of the gospel.
[time=1757] The Holy Spirit is only present in those
[time=1764] who have admitted their sinfulness, trusted the work of Christ on the cross further forgiveness and devoted themselves to faithfully following Jesus' teachings in the scriptures.
[time=1775] The Spirit of God only comes to those who are saved.
[time=1783] [AMEN] And if you don't grow without the Spirit, there isn't gonna be any Spirit unless you're saved and there's not gonna be any growth unless you're redeemed.
[time=1796] And so it's so important that you, you individually here, just take a moment and consider this.
[time=1803] There's no personal spiritual growth possible.
[time=1813] If you haven't believed the gospel, and this is important because some people get lured into thinking they can grow by doing more and more good things, I wanna take you to Acts chapter 10.
[time=1825] Please open your Bibles to Acts chapter 10.
[time=1829] I wanna show you what it says here in verses one and two.
[time=1832] I wanna introduce you briefly here this morning to a man named Cornelius.
[time=1836] I want you to follow along with me just so that you can see this point that we're making right here in the very pages of scripture.
[time=1842] It says in Acts 10, verses one and two.
[time=1845] Now there was a man at Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian cohort, sounds a little mafia-ish, but it wasn't a centurion of what was called the Italian cohort, a devout, listen, listen, a devout man, one who feared God with all his household and gave many alms offerings, money, gifts to the Jewish people, and prayed to God continually, prayed to God continually, gave alms,
[time=1883] God-fearing and devout.
[time=1886] Now you read that, I read that, most people read that and think, okay, that guy's in.
[time=1891] And I want you to watch what happens here.
[time=1895] In verse three and on, as the passage unfolds, God comes to Cornelius in a vision and tells Cornelius to send for Peter.
[time=1905] God comes to this Cornelius guy and says, I want you to send your guys and I want them to bring you Peter, my guy Peter, he's got something for you.
[time=1914] In essence is what God says.
[time=1916] And then Peter, meanwhile, has this vision of the sheet that comes down and then there's the four corners and there's the animals and God says to kill and eat and Peter says, whoa, whoa, no, I'm not gonna kill or eat that stuff, I've never killed or eaten unclean stuff.
[time=1935] And this is where God begins to reveal to Peter that the gospel's going to go beyond the Jews, now the gospel's going to go to the Gentiles, it's gonna go to the whole world.
[time=1947] Peter doesn't quite get it, but now God says, go to this guy Cornelius.
[time=1952] Even though Cornelius was a Gentile, God clearly tells Peter to go with these men that Cornelius sends and so these men come, they find Peter, they bring him back because there's something God wants to do with Cornelius.
[time=1967] And as Peter arrives, it becomes clear what that is.
[time=1972] God wants Peter to preach and deliver the gospel to Cornelius and so off he goes and we'll pick it up in verse 39, watch this.
[time=1984] We are witnesses Peter talking to Cornelius in his household.
[time=1988] He says, we are witnesses Cornelius of all the things.
[time=1992] He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem.
[time=1995] They also put him to death by hanging him on a cross.
[time=1998] God raised him up on the third day and granted that he become visible not to all people, but to witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God, that is to us who ate and drank with him after he arose from the dead and he ordered us Cornelius to preach to the people and solemnly to testify that this is the one who has been appointed by God as judge of the living and the dead, of him all the prophets bear witness that through his name, watch this, that through his name everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins.
[time=2037] And while Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message.
[time=2048] The Holy Spirit comes when someone is what?
[time=2052] Saved.
[time=2052] So as he's speaking the gospel,
[time=2058] this devout God-fearing, giving, praying man
[time=2064] comes to faith in Christ.
[time=2069] And as he comes to faith in Christ, as he believes, boom, the Spirit of God does what the Spirit of God does, he comes and indwells him as they were listening to the message, verse 45, all the circumcised believers who came with Peter, Jews, they're amazed because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also for they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God, then Peter answered surely, no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did.
[time=2107] Can he and he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ?
[time=2112] Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.
[time=2115] They believed, they were saved,
[time=2121] the Holy Spirit came upon them, they were baptized, and then they were used by God to further birth and establish his church.
[time=2131] They grew because they got the Holy Spirit and they got the Holy Spirit because they were saved.
[time=2138] Are you?
[time=2141] Are you saved?
[time=2151] And I don't care about all the definitions and caricatures that come with that phrase that you and I have heard over the years, forget them.
[time=2160] Have you bowed the knee of your heart and have you proclaimed your belief in the gospel?
[time=2170] Have you trusted Christ?
[time=2174] Not you, not your efforts, but what he accomplished.
[time=2179] Have you fully surrendered your heart and life to follow after him and him alone?
[time=2185] If you have, the Spirit of God has come to dwell in you
[time=2191] and this whole series and the five weeks of grow groups, it all counts, you can actually grow.
[time=2198] I know, Lord, I pray that you will, that you'll be a part of it with us.
[time=2204] Let me just pray and then we're gonna move on.
[time=2207] Father in heaven, I just ask that right now, in the hearts of those in this room, in the hearts and lives of those that may be listening online or watching on TV, oh God, I pray that your Spirit would be drawing them to a place where they would be willing to simply in their heart before you state their sinfulness, their recognition of their need for you, for life and forgiveness.
[time=2232] And oh God, I pray that they would come to a place of willingness to bow the knee of their heart and serve you and you only.
[time=2242] Oh God, may we have the joy of coming alongside them in the days to come and helping them in this journey of growth, we pray.
[time=2250] In your son's name, amen.
[time=2252] Amen, thank you for letting me do that.
[time=2256] Would you open now, flip over to Colossians, where I wanna talk to you for a few more minutes about this idea of grow or die, this concept of spiritual growth, and I wanna take you to a passage here in Colossians chapter two.
[time=2272] And as we come to Colossians chapter two and this idea of being rooted and grown in your faith, I wanna start just by reading to you some very real, very sad, but I think important stories to read through
[time=2292] that lead us, I know it leads me to ask a question, a question that is so very important to ask whenever we're talking about growth.
[time=2302] She was 18 years old and on her way to college.
[time=2309] After years of church involvement, parents who had valued the right things and a relationship with God that she quite honestly thought would sustain her.
[time=2321] And yet by the middle of second semester, she was distant from God.
[time=2327] She was drunk most weekends, sleeping with guys just for fun and battling an emptiness that left her lonely depressed and running from regret.
[time=2339] What happened?
[time=2345] He was 30 and already climbing the corporate ladder
[time=2351] when he accepted Christ and committed himself in that moment to making a difference for the Lord in the marketplace.
[time=2360] His busy schedule though was his excuse for never joining that small group Bible study.
[time=2366] And while he and his wife were somewhat consistent in their attendance at church and genuinely enjoyed when they went as the years went by, the thrill of his new faith waned, the spiritual impact he had once hoped to have never materialized and his life actually became characterized by growing amounts of financial, moral and ethical compromise.
[time=2391] What started out well ended badly.
[time=2394] What happened?
[time=2400] She was 51 years old, married 28 years with three kids who were now all out of the home and married.
[time=2409] She had gone to church from the day she was born faithfully, had been faithful to help serve in different ministries, had been faithful to support her husband, had been faithful to serve the many needs and activities of her children.
[time=2421] And now, and now at 51 with all of that behind her, she decided she no longer wanted to be faithful.
[time=2429] She had met a 35 year old online,
[time=2435] began to see him on the side eventually filed for divorce and now lives with him three hours away from her ex-husband, three kids and grandchildren.
[time=2447] What happened?
[time=2452] Too many times in scenarios, just like these, what happened is Colossians 28.
[time=2462] What happened, my friend, is Colossians 28.
[time=2465] See, to it that no one takes you, say the word church out loud, captive.
[time=2473] See, to it that no one takes you captive
[time=2479] through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.
[time=2492] What happens is that these people I just read to you about and many of you in the room have experienced yourselves, you get assaulted by the enemy.
[time=2503] The enemy and the million messages that get sent every day into your life and mind, a million different avenues.
[time=2511] It is incessant, it is ongoing, it never stops and the whole purpose behind the messages, the whole reason for the temptations from the enemy's perspective is he wants to take you captive.
[time=2524] He wants to begin to slowly ruin and destroy your life.
[time=2531] And it happens here, according to the text, it happens two ways through philosophy and empty, empty deception.
[time=2539] Let's look at this word, philosophy.
[time=2541] This word in the Greek referred to more than just a human academic wisdom.
[time=2546] No, this word in the Greek, it specifically had in view any, read it there, any secular theory about God, the world, the world's values or the meaning of life.
[time=2559] This is the thinking that you and I bump into every day.
[time=2564] This is the thinking that when they go away to college, they get more and more of.
[time=2568] This is the thinking that goes on in the workplace.
[time=2571] This is the thinking that happens in the neighborhood.
[time=2574] This is what happens at the club.
[time=2576] This is what happens in every situation you and I venture into.
[time=2581] It is the way the world views things apart from the truth, philosophy.
[time=2589] Simply stated in this context, it was worldly thinking that leads to empty deception.
[time=2597] What is empty deception?
[time=2600] Worthless lies that promise and never deliver.
[time=2604] Can you think of a few?
[time=2605] Worthless lies that promise and never deliver.
[time=2611] Feudal pursuits embraced by those who by the lie
[time=2617] that anything good at all can be found or experienced beyond God's design.
[time=2626] I hope you understand that.
[time=2627] I hope you see that if you think, if you're here today or you're listening and you're of the opinion right now at this moment in your life that any form of happiness can ever be experienced outside the will of God, then understand you're currently being deceived.
[time=2648] That the only lasting happiness, the only true satisfaction in life is when you and I experience that within the parameters that a loving God who actually cares about you deeply has established.
[time=2664] Other than that, empty deception is what's going on.
[time=2669] Philosophy lies, people taken captive by worldly, not godly thinking, empty lies, not divine promises.
[time=2678] The Colossians and the three people in the stories I just shared, all of them had the chance to grow.
[time=2687] Every day people who have been granted by God, chance to go forward, to deepen their faith and broaden their impact.
[time=2696] So why is it that some grow?
[time=2698] You ever ask yourself, why is it that some mature, why is it that some grow up strong and wise?
[time=2706] There's a depth of character and an ability to withstand the pressures and why is it that some don't grow?
[time=2714] Why is it that some die?
[time=2715] They wither, they snap, they wilt.
[time=2719] Here's a question for you, how does the captivity of Colossians 2.8 occur?
[time=2726] Is there anything we can do to avoid the captivity of Colossians 2.8?
[time=2732] And thank God, the answer is in Colossians 2.6 and 7.
[time=2737] Let me read this to you.
[time=2738] It says right there, therefore as you have received Christ, Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him.
[time=2745] The word walk there has to do with the everyday activities of your life and mine.
[time=2750] Having been firmly rooted, just love the way it sounds.
[time=2756] I just like saying it, firmly rooted.
[time=2760] And now being built up in Him and established in your faith just as you were instructed and overflowing with gratitude,
[time=2771] rooted and established, built up.
[time=2775] This is how you grow, my friends.
[time=2777] It's how you avoid captivity, it's how you avoid breaking, it's how you can stay away from the deadly pitfalls of immaturity, you need to get rooted.
[time=2788] The Greek word, the Greek word for rooted there in the text is resumed.
[time=2793] It means to take root, literally it means to have root, think about plants now, think about trees, think about the ones that do well, think about the strong ones.
[time=2802] It means to have roots that grow deep and sound a root system, a root itself that provides stability and sturdiness.
[time=2811] It's really a great picture.
[time=2814] Okay, so think about it, you're the plant, you're the tree and I want you and I do, this isn't like make believe.
[time=2821] I want, as I look at you this morning, I want for you the ability to stand in the midst of pressure.
[time=2828] I want for you when the winds blow really hard in your life.
[time=2833] When the worldly thinking, when the philosophy and empty deception start flying your way, I want for you the ability to stand with great strength and sturdiness.
[time=2845] And what we learn here is that you're gonna need some roots.
[time=2848] You're gonna need to be like that tree and some one that's planted.
[time=2852] So what's it gonna take?
[time=2856] What's it take to grow great roots?
[time=2860] Some of you, even some in my own family, are really good at this.
[time=2865] Others of us aren't, but I think most of you in the room, if I just said on the gardening like, okay, we're outside now and we've got the shovel and there's the dirt and here's the seeds.
[time=2876] If I said like, what are three things you need to ensure that what you're gonna plant ends up growing really solid, sound sturdy roots.
[time=2886] I think most of us could come pretty close.
[time=2889] Here you go, three things that have got to be there.
[time=2892] Good soil, water, no weeds.
[time=2895] Write them down.
[time=2897] Good soil, you agree?
[time=2900] Water, agree, no weeds.
[time=2903] And then what I want you to do is on your piece of paper next to those, we're gonna just write three things.
[time=2910] Some spiritual correlation that I wanna make that I think really works and really can help you and I, when it comes to growing strong roots in our lives, when it comes to growing strong roots in our kids' lives, when it comes to the kind of stability underneath it all, that makes a difference on that day when the winds blow really, really hard.
[time=2932] Filled with the Holy Spirit, write that next to good soil and after you do that, turn to Romans eight.
[time=2940] My friends, I believe that a submission on a regular daily basis to the work of the Holy Spirit in your life, which means being filled with the Spirit.
[time=2954] See, every day, remember?
[time=2956] Every day you and I have a choice.
[time=2957] We're not talking about the indwelling that happens at salvation.
[time=2961] We're talking about are you going to be, am I going to be each and every day?
[time=2966] Are we going to be filled with the Spirit, submitted to Him, open and listening and wanting to be directed by Him, or are we going to be led by the flesh?
[time=2979] See, this is a choice that we make.
[time=2982] Spirit of God available to you and to me.
[time=2985] And for soil, for growth to begin to happen, for roots to be able to go down deep, there's got to be, in your life and mind, a regular pattern, a consistency of being filled with the Spirit, because listen, friends, the Spirit of God leads to life.
[time=3003] And the flesh leads to what?
[time=3006] Say it, look at Romans eight.
[time=3009] It says in Romans eight, five.
[time=3010] Romans eight, five, for those who are according to the flesh,
[time=3016] I'm not going to be filled with the Spirit.
[time=3018] I'm going to do what I want to do.
[time=3019] I'm going to do what feels good.
[time=3021] I'm going to do what's fun.
[time=3022] I'm going to do what's immediately fulfilling.
[time=3028] For those who are according to the flesh, set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
[time=3035] For the mindset on the flesh is what?
[time=3037] Death, but the mindset on the Spirit is life and peace.
[time=3041] This is where growth happens.
[time=3043] Because the mindset on the flesh is hostile toward God.
[time=3047] For it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so.
[time=3054] For those who are in the flesh cannot even please God.
[time=3058] However, you are not in the flesh.
[time=3061] You see that?
[time=3062] As a believer, but in the Spirit.
[time=3065] If indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.
[time=3067] But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him.
[time=3071] We established that earlier.
[time=3073] If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the Spirit is alive because of righteousness.
[time=3081] But if the Spirit of him who raised him from the dead, who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.
[time=3101] So as we begin this just brief discussion here
[time=3107] about the formulating of a deep and healthy root system, understand that that soil right there, it starts with your leaning each day.
[time=3119] And I mean it, oh, Spirit of God, I wanna follow you.
[time=3124] Oh, Spirit of God, please convict me.
[time=3126] Oh, Spirit of God, please guide me today.
[time=3130] Oh, Spirit of God guard my heart.
[time=3133] Spirit of God reveal to me the things that you want me to see.
[time=3137] See, you might think these are just things that guys like me should say.
[time=3142] No, no, you should say, you should be.
[time=3146] We should be on a regular daily basis submitting and subjecting ourselves to the leading of the Spirit as he fills us and moves us in directions he wants to move us in.
[time=3160] He's not this weird, nebulous, jello-it thing over here that we should be afraid of.
[time=3166] No, he wants to give everyday real, loving, discerning, wise guidance and we need to be filled with him, it's good soil, amen?
[time=3177] Water, gotta have water.
[time=3181] You gotta have water.
[time=3184] We gotta be immersed in the Word.
[time=3188] I know the illustration breaks down a bit 'cause you can overwater a plant.
[time=3193] I don't think you can over-word yourself (laughs) but why don't we try?
[time=3198] Why don't we try?
[time=3202] Isaiah 55, can I read this for you?
[time=3205] Isaiah 55, here we see this great picture of the Word of God and all that it accomplishes.
[time=3214] It says in Isaiah 55, 10, with reference to God's Word for as the rain, water and the snow, water, as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there without watering the earth and making it bear and sprout and furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eaters.
[time=3235] So will my word, just like with the water.
[time=3240] So will my word be which goes forth from my mouth.
[time=3246] It will not return to me empty without accomplishing what I desire and without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.
[time=3257] Water purifies.
[time=3259] Water gives life.
[time=3261] Water carries nutrients.
[time=3263] Water brings fruit.
[time=3265] And this is exactly what the Word of God can do when you and I immerse ourselves in it.
[time=3274] I love husbands, husbands in the room.
[time=3279] I'm always reminded of what it says in Ephesians 5.
[time=3282] Oh guys, don't forget this.
[time=3285] We need to work on this.
[time=3286] You and I need to be better at this.
[time=3288] More faithful to do this in creative and meaningful ways.
[time=3291] Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave himself up for her so that he might sanctify her.
[time=3300] We already learned about that word.
[time=3302] That means to grow spiritually.
[time=3304] Having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word.
[time=3309] Husbands are to be the primary agent
[time=3316] of spiritual sanctification.
[time=3319] Growth in the heart and soul of a wife comes when a husband is willing to faithfully wash her with the word.
[time=3330] You say, what does that mean?
[time=3331] What does that look like?
[time=3333] Well, you figure it out.
[time=3338] Once you get your Bible, and why don't you sit down with your wife?
[time=3347] Why don't you figure out ways to incorporate the scripture into your relationship with her?
[time=3353] Pray for me as I continue to try and do that well.
[time=3359] I'll pray for you, but I want you just to see here in this passage, it's the water of the word.
[time=3365] And it helps grow roots deep in a soil that's prepared by the Holy Spirit.
[time=3371] And then we come to the weeds.
[time=3374] No weeds, anybody who grows anything knows weeds are bad.
[time=3377] Weeds are very, very bad because weeds choke.
[time=3380] Weeds ruin, weeds get in the way, weeds tangle.
[time=3385] And look, remember what it says in Hebrews 12, one.
[time=3388] I'll see it there on the screen.
[time=3389] Therefore, since we have so great a clot of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside, move away from sin, confess it.
[time=3398] Lay aside every encumbrance in the sin, which so easily what?
[time=3401] Say it, church, entangles us.
[time=3404] It's exactly what goes on.
[time=3405] The roots get all messed up.
[time=3410] The roots get cut off.
[time=3411] Life gets squeezed out when you and I don't confess.
[time=3415] And I'll just say this to you.
[time=3416] I have not done a good job of this in my own life.
[time=3419] I've not done a good job of this with my family.
[time=3423] I'm trying to work on this, trying to help create a confessional atmosphere.
[time=3430] For me in my life, I took the principle of confession
[time=3436] for years and years and years, and I treated it like a 14 second thing you just throw up 'cause you know he's listening.
[time=3445] Instead of taking the time to each and every day at different times of the day, truly check myself spiritually and see if there is any wicked way, any wicked thought, any evil that might need to be confessed.
[time=3459] If my view of sin is what we arrived at a few weeks ago, if sin is really heinous and if sin is really harmful, and if sin is really dangerous, then there should be in my life and my kids' lives and our family's life and your life, this enormous commitment to confession, and I don't just mean it dinner.
[time=3478] Confession, constant confession,
[time=3484] to agree with God about our sin and move in a different direction.
[time=3489] (upbeat music)
