[time=448] Singing, "Shall we be by?"
[time=454] Deepens my soul, by life, by hope.
[time=500] Crown him with many crowns.
[time=530] Deepens my precious people, all these memories.
[time=539] Can we stand together and sing this next verse?
[time=542] Crown to the Lord of life, you'll try to control the grave.
[time=552] Who grows victorious, through the strike, for those he came to say.
[time=561] His glory's now and he's seen, who died and rose on high.
[time=571] Who died eternal life to bring and lives that tell me that.
[time=582] Crown him the Lord of life, for him the Father knows.
[time=593] But with the spirit through him, he'll come to glory us now.
[time=603] To leave the endless grace for the more us must die, without our dueen justice.
[time=619] Lord, can it be that our should gain?
[time=648] An interest in the Saviour's blood, died He for me, who caused His pain, for me,
[time=665] whom Him to death pursue, amazing love, how can it be that thou, my God,
[time=683] should die for me, amazing love, how can it be that thou, my God, should die for me?
[time=705] He lent his father's love above, so freaky, so infinite, his grace,
[time=719] emptied himself from all love, and went for items of less grace.
[time=733] 'Tis mercy on the immense entry, oh, my God, it found how can we,
[time=747] amazing love, how can it be that thou, my God, should die for me?
[time=763] No condemnation, now I tread, Jesus and all, in Him His mind,
[time=777] her life in Him, my living hand, and cold and righteous and steep, I,
[time=791] oh, I approach the eternal love, and pray the cry, the cry's my home,
[time=804] amazing love, how can it be that thou, my God, should die for me?
[time=821] Well, hello again, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=845] It is good to be with you, and as always, I'm thankful for these few minutes that we can spend together.
[time=850] I want to encourage you, if you're like most people who watch the Bible Hour, you're catching this on Sunday mornings, about 8.30 if I'm not mistaken, and I want to just tell you something today that might encourage you to set that alarm a little bit earlier, and you can call it free advertisement, you can call it whatever you want, but there is at 7.30 a chance for you to be so very encouraged with my good friend Dr. Mitchell Cruz and
[time=875] a show that's called Restoration Road.
[time=877] That's right, at 7.30 I think over on the sister station, 33, or the MBC affiliate, Mitchell
[time=883] has a show that week after week gives really you the opportunity to hear stories of God's
[time=890] restoring, God's transforming, God's reconciling power, lives are changed all over the world
[time=898] every day, people are being transformed, their stories are stories that bring to light the
[time=905] miraculous work of God, and it may be young people, it may be middle-aged folks, it could be senior adults, it could be people here in Fort Wayne, Mitch finds him, and he and his
[time=916] crew go and record their stories, and we get to see those stories on Restoration Road.
[time=922] So I want to just encourage you, I'm so thankful for Mitchell as a friend, so grateful for the ministry that he has here in this area, so many people on a weekly basis.
[time=932] If it's not through Restoration Road, it's through his show on WBCL, but God is using Mitch to really proclaim God's story of Restoration.
[time=942] And I hope you'll watch at 7.30 Sunday mornings and then go get some breakfast, get a cup of coffee and come back and join us here at 8.30.
[time=950] God bless you.
[time=951] I hope you enjoy today's message, I hope you open your heart and mind to what God will have for you as we start our study of Deuteronomy and the kind of life that God really does
[time=962] want you to have.
[time=963] I hope you're encouraged, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=968] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is risen today, Hallelujah,
[time=989] sons of men and angels say, Hallelujah, raise your joys and triumphs high, Hallelujah,
[time=1009] singing hymns and earthy blood, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=1033] Lives again our glorious King, Hallelujah, where all death is now feasting, Hallelujah,
[time=1051] dying once the altar said, Hallelujah, where our victory, O brave, Hallelujah,
[time=1071] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=1084] Hey, I know it's been a while since you've probably done this, but open your Bibles to
[time=1095] the book of Deuteronomy.
[time=1098] That's right.
[time=1099] The book of Deuteronomy.
[time=1100] We're about to embark upon what's going to be about a seven-week study.
[time=1104] We wanted to do this before we got into December.
[time=1106] Deuteronomy's got like 78 chapters, so we couldn't get it all in, but we're going to get seven in, and these seven chapters that we're going to study beginning today in chapter four of Deuteronomy, these seven chapters are really an incredible study.
[time=1122] Listen, an incredible study that gives us insight into the life, the life that God desired
[time=1129] to give to His people, the nation of Israel.
[time=1134] There was a relationship that He longed to have with them.
[time=1138] There was a way in which He wanted to bless them.
[time=1142] There is a way in which He wanted them to respond to Him.
[time=1146] There is a way in which He designed and wanted them to follow Him.
[time=1151] There was a way in which He wanted to interact with and be their King and be their God and
[time=1157] be the one that loved and cared for them.
[time=1160] Oh, there was a life that God desired, and it was a life that He knew they could experience.
[time=1167] He knew they could have if they would only love and obey Him.
[time=1176] Several years ago I saw a book in the airport walking through one day, the bookstore there, it was your best life now.
[time=1183] And I've looked at that book, I've looked at it and read other books like it.
[time=1188] I've seen movies that communicate the same message.
[time=1191] We're going to say the message of that book is all over the media and our culture today.
[time=1197] And the message that I'm referring to is a very common message that you and I hear often, and that is this, that if you're interested in having your best life, it's up to you.
[time=1207] That you can positive think your way toward it.
[time=1210] You can create and manufacture your own destiny.
[time=1213] You can do these things.
[time=1216] You can.
[time=1218] You can give yourself, if you want it badly enough and you can be smart enough and shrewd
[time=1224] enough to get there, your best life now.
[time=1229] I don't think that's what the Scriptures teach.
[time=1232] I think the Scripture teaches, if you're interested in the best life you could ever have, you can't do it, God will bring that to you in the midst of your love and obedience and
[time=1246] your faithfulness to him.
[time=1247] And that is the exact life and relationship that he wanted to have with his people.
[time=1252] And so we come to that this morning in Deuteronomy 4.
[time=1255] Let me just say this to you as kind of a way of moving into this study.
[time=1261] I know we're fourth chapter, so we skipped a couple.
[time=1265] Let me just say this to you, for those of you that don't know this, for others of you, maybe you've learned this or at some point in time, but let me just remind you Deuteronomy,
[time=1274] the book of Deuteronomy, it comes at a place, at a juncture in the life of the nation of
[time=1281] Israel that was rather unbelievable.
[time=1285] Most of you know the people of God, the Jews, the nation of Israel suffered immensely under
[time=1291] the heavy hand of Pharaoh for hundreds of years, remember they were in captivity in Egypt,
[time=1297] where they were mistreated, where they were abused, where their faith was mocked, where they were killed and tortured and raped and beaten, put to work like dogs and they cried
[time=1308] out to their God and they cried out to their God and God finally hears their cry.
[time=1315] We hear of and we read about and we've seen the movie and we know there is the Exodus.
[time=1321] There is this day when God delivers His people from the hand of Pharaoh and by the hundreds
[time=1327] and hundreds of thousands they leave Egypt free on their way to the land that He had promised
[time=1335] them on their way to the blessing that He had committed to their forefathers.
[time=1340] He had told them there is a land and it will be yours and it is flowing with milk and honey.
[time=1345] It is a place of blessing where I will establish you as my people and so He frees them from the captivity of Pharaoh and now they leave on their way to this holy, wonderful, much
[time=1357] anticipated, promised land.
[time=1360] Problem is, and we've talked about this before, problem is they don't like how the journey goes.
[time=1367] They thought the journey was going to be like this.
[time=1369] They thought they were going to be able to have that.
[time=1371] They thought.
[time=1372] They wanted.
[time=1373] They complained.
[time=1374] They didn't get their attitudes with South and before you know it in an enormous amount of unfaithfulness and contempt and whining, in essence to say to God we would have been
[time=1385] better off in Egypt.
[time=1387] We don't like it out here.
[time=1388] We don't like the way you're directing.
[time=1393] We want something better and we want something better now.
[time=1396] So God says fine.
[time=1400] I'll have you now wander.
[time=1402] I'll have you now circle the desert in your unfaithfulness and in the midst of your contemptual
[time=1412] thinking and attitude, you can just sit out here in the desert for 40 years.
[time=1417] And so 40 years come and go.
[time=1420] For 40 years they toil.
[time=1422] For 40 years they wander.
[time=1424] And at the end of those 40 years you come to the book of Deuteronomy.
[time=1432] They are camped on the plains of Moab, it was called.
[time=1437] They're literally right on the bank of the Jordan River and my mind always goes here.
[time=1444] I'm sorry, but it's the ultimate Deuteronomy is like the ultimate pre-game speech.
[time=1449] It is the biggest adventure.
[time=1451] It is the biggest endeavor they've ever embarked upon.
[time=1454] God is actually going to lead them into the land and he knows what they will face.
[time=1459] He knows the challenges that will come.
[time=1462] And he says to them in Deuteronomy, this is what you have to know.
[time=1467] This is what you must do.
[time=1469] These are the commitments you must make.
[time=1472] Oh Israel, he says, listen, here are the things you must hold dear to your heart.
[time=1479] If you are going to be my people in this land living the life that I've called you to live.
[time=1488] And so we come to Deuteronomy 4 this morning.
[time=1492] And I want you to look with me at the first verse, Deuteronomy chapter 4 verse 1.
[time=1497] It really is a verse that as you read through all of chapter 4, which I hope you will, as
[time=1503] you read through all of chapter 4 you'll find that verse 1 is really a great overview and so we will look at it this morning.
[time=1510] I want you to read it along with me here.
[time=1512] It says in 4-1, now oh Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am teaching
[time=1518] you to perform so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land which the
[time=1525] Lord, the God of your fathers is giving you.
[time=1530] We're going to work our way right through that verse.
[time=1532] You're going to see this morning, listen, oh Israel, we're going to talk about the statutes and the judgments.
[time=1538] You're going to see what it means when it says in order that you may live and in order that you may go in and take possession of the land.
[time=1547] Let's start this morning, my friends, with listen now, listen, oh Israel.
[time=1553] You see it there at the beginning of verse 1, oh Israel, listen.
[time=1561] Some of you in the room, as we come to a study like this, may be a little confused by that
[time=1568] in that we're talking about or the text seems to be addressing Israel and I want to just make sure that you're clear on that.
[time=1575] Whenever you see in this study, and especially as we make our way through, hear the book of Deuteronomy or as you make your way through the Old Testament, whenever you hear God talking to or addressing the people of Israel, understand you should listen, he's talking to you.
[time=1592] Here he's talking to his children, here he's talking to this nation whom he made his own,
[time=1598] but understand that if you know the Lord, if you have fully surrendered your heart and life to him, you become a child of God, you become part of the family of God.
[time=1608] You are his chosen people, a royal priesthood, wherever it says here or listen Israel.
[time=1617] He's talking to the people of God.
[time=1619] For the purposes of our study, it's very important that you understand he's calling you to listen.
[time=1626] He's calling you and me to pay attention.
[time=1632] He's saying listen, dug, listen, flowers, listen, mailes, ravers, on-checks, millers,
[time=1648] moors.
[time=1651] He's saying this to you.
[time=1657] This morning, here in this place, right out of the gate, it's so important he wants you
[time=1667] to listen, and I want to just ask you before we go any further, why is it that you don't?
[time=1680] Why don't I?
[time=1681] Why don't we listen to God when God speaks so clearly and so evidently?
[time=1692] It's not ambiguous.
[time=1694] He gives us his word.
[time=1697] He gives us those who explain it to us.
[time=1699] He gives the Spirit of God who dwells within you, who brings clarity.
[time=1702] We talked about it last week.
[time=1704] He teaches you know why is it when God is so many times so very clear in what he says
[time=1711] to you, why don't we listen?
[time=1715] When he says stop, why do we keep going?
[time=1717] When he says walk, why do I run?
[time=1720] When he says go another way, why do we so oftentimes plow ahead?
[time=1725] I just thought about it this week, I wrote three things down, I hope you'll write them down, more than writing them down, I hope you'll identify if you need to with this.
[time=1736] There are those in the room, those of you watching on the broadcast, and there are times when you don't listen because the truth of the matter is number one, you don't care.
[time=1746] You've come to a place, I don't know why, there's probably a thousand reasons, but you've come to this place in your relationship with him where you just have stopped caring what he
[time=1756] says.
[time=1758] He says that it is clear, you'll probably even agree with that, but somehow, some way, you sit or stand here in a sense today saying, I don't care.
[time=1770] Others of you don't care, but you're not caring isn't as aggressive.
[time=1775] The second point I wrote down is some of you think you know better.
[time=1780] You're not quite to the point where you just say, forget about it, I could care less.
[time=1783] You sort of care, but the truth is you just think you're smarter than God.
[time=1789] It's quite a statement when you just stop and think about it for a moment, but it's really
[time=1795] the way you're living.
[time=1796] You think that you are smarter than God, that you can think it through better, that your
[time=1805] way is more right or understandable.
[time=1810] There are some who just don't care, there are some who think you know better, and there are others who really are in a different place and they would just say that they're confused.
[time=1820] Yes, I stand here and say, God speaks clearly, you might be sitting here today going, well,
[time=1826] it's not so clear to me, I could really use some help.
[time=1830] It may look like I'm not listening, and in fact, maybe I'm not, but it's not because I don't care and it's not because I think I know better, I just don't, I don't know what to do, somebody help me.
[time=1842] And I want to just pray prayers all morning for you all already, I've been praying prayers
[time=1848] for those first two groups.
[time=1850] My prayer for you would be a prayer of caution, that is not a good place to be.
[time=1855] It is not a good place to be when you're willing or ready to just say, you know what, I could care less, I'm going to do what I want to do.
[time=1863] I think I'm smarter than God.
[time=1865] I've been praying prayers of caution and warning for you, and that third group I've been praying
[time=1871] prayers of clarity.
[time=1873] I want the Word of God and that what she desires for you to be absolutely clear.
[time=1878] I don't want you to live in confusion any longer.
[time=1881] I want where he wants you to go, how he wants you to live, the way he wants you to think, to be absolutely unequivocally clear, so you can make a choice, a choice of obedience
[time=1893] and honor.
[time=1894] In fact, verse 1 now, oh Israel, listen, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am
[time=1903] teaching you to perform.
[time=1905] It says, God gave Moses these statutes and these judgments, and he wants Moses to teach
[time=1913] them to the people so the people can understand them and do them and live by them.
[time=1918] We'll just look at these two together, statutes and judgments, statutes are, I hope you'll write it down, statutes are truth.
[time=1926] God wanted his people to have the truth.
[time=1930] There is a true way of living, there is a true way of thinking, there is a way in which
[time=1936] choices can be made and values can be established that are based on truth, not lies.
[time=1945] And so he gives them statutes, truths, God-given principles to live by, principles that will
[time=1953] guide them, and he gives them judgments.
[time=1956] Whereas statutes are principles, judgments are actual parameters, decisions that God
[time=1963] has made with respect to how you should walk.
[time=1968] He wanted the Israelites to walk a certain way.
[time=1972] He wanted, in essence, the Israelites to live a certain way.
[time=1975] He wanted them living their lives to be within the boundaries and the parameters that he
[time=1982] established.
[time=1985] He doesn't hang him out to dry, he doesn't say, "Here we are on the plains of Moab, there's the promised land, go ahead, get your feet wet, cross on over, good luck to you."
[time=1995] No, he says, "I have a way in which I want you to think.
[time=1999] There is a way of relating between you and me that I will establish.
[time=2003] There's a way that I want you to relate to those nations that you're going to bump into.
[time=2008] There's a way I want you to do government.
[time=2010] There's a way I want you to do your physical relationships.
[time=2013] There's a way I want you to do family.
[time=2015] There's a way I want you to show commitment." And he shows them statutes and judgments, parameters and boundaries.
[time=2026] Why?
[time=2027] I'm asking, think about that for a second, why?
[time=2036] And here's where we actually lose a lot of people, I think, in this discussion.
[time=2043] Why here's the question, why all the parameters?
[time=2048] Plains of Moab, nation of Israel, the journey out of Egypt, all the wandering and unfaithfulness.
[time=2057] Now it's time to go into the promised land, time for God to have His people and for His people to have their God, time to reach all these nations.
[time=2068] God knew what was coming, God knew what the challenges would look like.
[time=2073] God knew the enormity and the severity of those challenges.
[time=2078] Why all the parameters?
[time=2081] Why all the God-given rules?
[time=2084] Now I've been reading in Deuteronomy a lot over the last couple of months.
[time=2092] There's a lot of rules, there's a lot of principles, there's a lot of statutes.
[time=2099] He gave them a whole bunch of judgments.
[time=2104] Why, why all the do-this is, why all the do-that's?
[time=2110] Well when you ask this question, and as we discuss it back and forth, you know there's really only two answers, two reasons why, that kind of get talked about.
[time=2122] Number one, He loves us.
[time=2123] Number one, He loved them.
[time=2126] He loved them, He loves us and He wants to guide and protect us.
[time=2132] He knows what's coming and so He in a very loving way says here, here are some parameters
[time=2138] and boundaries, here are some principles to live by, follow them and it will go well,
[time=2145] disregard them and it won't.
[time=2147] So one answer to the why is He loves us.
[time=2150] Some people say the answer is He's a control freak.
[time=2154] That's what God is.
[time=2155] They say you read the Old Testament, you look at how it all got laid out, He's a control freak that simply enjoyed running His people around having them do things that He wanted done.
[time=2165] He's egotistical.
[time=2167] Well you're going to have to think that one through.
[time=2171] Let me just ask you this as you're thinking, if my wife and I are leaving the house for
[time=2178] just a couple of hours, let's say, we're going to leave Jake and Evie, our two youngest ones, let's say, just for a couple of hours and if I tell Jake, hey Jake, here's the deal.
[time=2187] I write it all out.
[time=2190] We sit down there at the counter before we leave and I say, hey Jake, here's the deal.
[time=2194] When the pizza is done, pull it out of the oven and turn off the oven.
[time=2199] It's written right there.
[time=2200] See that?
[time=2201] Yes, Dad.
[time=2202] Jake, don't answer the phone at all.
[time=2206] Unless you see it's mom, cell number, or mine on the caller ID.
[time=2211] Don't go to the door or play outside while we're gone at all.
[time=2218] Did you hear me?
[time=2219] Yep, Dad, I got you.
[time=2220] Don't go outside at all.
[time=2223] Only watch Nat Geo History Channel or Andy Griffith DVDs.
[time=2228] By the way, if you haven't got your Andy Griffith DVDs, you are so missing out.
[time=2235] Go get a set, like right now, the kids love them, it's hilarious.
[time=2241] No swimming in the pond, none, 'cause you can't get to the pond 'cause you're not supposed
[time=2247] to go where?
[time=2248] Outside.
[time=2249] Good job, Jake.
[time=2251] And please wash your dishes before we get home.
[time=2254] That's for my wife.
[time=2256] Am I a control freak?
[time=2261] Seriously, is that some whacked out control freak who just wants to have a 12 year old,
[time=2268] a nine year old, and running around, keeping busy just for the sake of it?
[time=2273] No.
[time=2274] Or am I maybe a loving dad who knows what might be best for them in the next two hours?
[time=2281] Church, let's get this straight in our heads once and for all, and I am gonna speak for
[time=2289] you on this one because I know this is true.
[time=2291] We are, you guys, we are kids.
[time=2297] We are children through and through.
[time=2302] We are bent toward playing with matches, and I don't mean literal ones, although I do
[time=2311] enjoy a good fire.
[time=2315] I like pouring gas on the fire, and I always get made fun of, 'cause it's not a true fire,
[time=2321] 'cause I'm from California and whoever taught me how to build a fire, you know what I mean?
[time=2325] I don't pour gas on the fire in the fireplace, I'm sorry, if you're thinking in the living room, no.
[time=2330] I'm talking about outside, but we're kids, you guys.
[time=2336] I'm bent toward opening the door for strangers.
[time=2343] You're bent toward swimming without supervision.
[time=2350] We need rules, and God knew it, and God gave them because He loves us and He wants to give
[time=2361] us guidance and direction.
[time=2364] I get a little concerned sometimes when I hear people talking about our faith, I'll hear
[time=2371] you talking about it, I'll even say this at times, we'll be in a discussion with someone either a friendly debate about our faith or someone genuinely interested in knowing more about our faith, and there are times when we will go out of our way to say, "Hey, I want you to know Christianity isn't about rules," we say.
[time=2391] We seem to want to just distance us from any notion that this is about following direction,
[time=2402] and I want to just try to clarify something for you this morning, my opinion from my own study in 25 years of trying to make this stuff somewhat clear, listen, salvation has nothing
[time=2413] to do with rules.
[time=2416] I agree with that.
[time=2418] You can't earn it, you can't be good enough to get it.
[time=2423] Christianity, if by that you mean living life in a way whereby we are devoted to following
[time=2429] the teachings of Jesus.
[time=2432] Our faith being lived out, my friends, there is some rule following.
[time=2439] There just is.
[time=2441] There are parameters, and there are statutes, and there are judgments that God has given us, that we are to follow.
[time=2450] And I don't think we should be ashamed of that.
[time=2452] I don't think it makes us when we do them well better than the other.
[time=2455] I don't think it gets us any more favor with God.
[time=2458] I just want you to understand that in relationship with God, like in relationship with a Father,
[time=2464] there are rules, they are good rules, there's a purpose behind them, and God gave them to
[time=2470] us to obey.
[time=2475] So he lovingly provides statutes and judgments.
[time=2479] Look at Psalm 119, Psalm 119, turn your Bibles there, go on past Deuteronomy all the way to
[time=2488] Psalms 119, I want you just to think about statutes, these principles that God has called
[time=2496] us to live by.
[time=2497] Psalm 119 speaks of them extensively in Psalm 119, Psalm 119, Psalm 116, oh that my ways
[time=2507] may be established to keep your statutes, then I shall not be ashamed when I look upon
[time=2516] all your commandments.
[time=2518] I hope you'll just write this down there in verses 5 and 6, you see that the statutes of God bring confidence, they bring confidence, not shame.
[time=2529] Look at verse 8, "I shall keep your statutes, do not forsake me utterly."
[time=2538] I hope you'll write this down, there you find in verse 8 that disregard them, if you disregard
[time=2545] his statutes you may find yourself on your own, and on this journey of life my friends,
[time=2551] that's a place you don't want to be, you don't want to be on your own.
[time=2557] If you look at verse 23, "Even though princes, even though rulers, even though kings sit and
[time=2564] talk against me, your servant meditates on your," what say it, "statutes, your principles,
[time=2574] they instill courage, kings, and princes aren't going to scare me." No, because I'm one who meditates on your principles.
[time=2582] Look at verse 33, Psalm 119, 33, it says, "Teach me, O Lord, the way of your statutes,
[time=2590] and I shall observe it to the end." Statutes, they have life long value.
[time=2598] There the psalmist talks about his journey through all of life, all the way to the end of his life, observing and keeping and obeying God's statutes, verse 48, "And I shall lift
[time=2612] up my hands to your commandments which I love and I will meditate on.
[time=2617] I will focus on, I will memorize, I will say back, I will pray through, I will constantly
[time=2626] be immersed in, I will meditate on your statutes.
[time=2634] They deserve our focused attention." Now look at 54, I'm so thankful that Corbin and others lead us in this way, your statutes
[time=2647] are my songs.
[time=2649] In the house of my pilgrimage, we should sing them, my friends, the truths of God when the
[time=2655] churches gathered, listen people of God, listen to the statutes and judgments so that
[time=2668] what?
[time=2669] Why is it so important that you would listen and obey God's principles and parameters?
[time=2678] Now O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am teaching you to perform so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land which the Lord the God of your fathers is giving you.
[time=2689] In order that you may live, we tend to, watch this church, we tend to read this verse this
[time=2697] way.
[time=2698] Here's how we typically read this verse, we read this verse like this, that you may live and go in and take possession of the land.
[time=2706] But I want you this morning, I want you to slow down and I want you to read the verse
[time=2712] the way the verse was written because there's an "and" in there that separates the first
[time=2719] thought from the second.
[time=2722] I want you to read it like this, in order that you may live, stop.
[time=2736] We'll get to, we'll get to and take possession of the land here in just a moment.
[time=2742] But I first want you to just clearly see how God wrote it.
[time=2750] Listen, O Israel, to the statutes and the judgments which God is giving you so that you
[time=2761] may live.
[time=2765] What it's saying is this, if you don't listen to and follow God's statutes, not, not living
[time=2776] might very well be an option.
[time=2781] And very well may be an option, you say, well wait a minute, I don't see that, we'll just keep reading.
[time=2785] Look at verse three, because he gives them an example as soon as he says it, your eyes have seen what the Lord has done in the case of Baal, Pior, for all the men who followed
[time=2797] Baal, I sense a departure from his statutes there.
[time=2803] For all the men who followed Baal, Pior, the Lord your God has destroyed them from among
[time=2810] you, but you who help fast to the Lord your God are alive today, every one of you.
[time=2819] You say, what's this Baal, Pior stuff, go back to numbers.
[time=2823] There was a day, really, there was a day in my life in ministry where I would be afraid
[time=2829] to read passages like this to groups of people like this, but I'm no longer afraid to read
[time=2836] these things.
[time=2837] I find great strength and great confidence in the fact that there's stuff in here that my God did, there's ways in which he thinks, there's stuff that he allows, there are decisions
[time=2847] he made that I don't get at all, it's not how I would do it, but whoa, there's a revelation,
[time=2855] I'm not God.
[time=2858] And I think you need to be and I need to be reminded of this.
[time=2862] Again and again and again, his understanding, I heard it this week in one of our grove groups,
[time=2868] his understanding of justice, his understanding of holiness, his understanding of what's
[time=2877] right and what he chooses to do with that which is wrong and in opposition to it is
[time=2883] thoroughly and completely up to him.
[time=2887] And his ways never have been, never will be my ways, his thoughts are not my thoughts.
[time=2894] And so make sure that you're careful, make sure that we're cautious in how we view chapters
[time=2900] and passages like this.
[time=2902] Here you go, while Israel remained at Chateem, the people began to play the harlot with
[time=2912] the daughters of Moab, that's written very PG-ish, you understand that, right?
[time=2919] Here we have the people of God, frustrated and upset, they don't like where they are,
[time=2926] they don't like how God is working, so they say, you know what, forget it.
[time=2930] He told us we were not to intermarry, he told us in our morality, we were to stay pure,
[time=2936] we're not going to.
[time=2937] We're going to step outside of what God has delivered to us and we're going to begin to involve ourselves sexually with women from another nation and they bring them in, they
[time=2947] bring them into the camp.
[time=2949] For they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods and the people ate and bowed down to their gods, so Israel joined themselves to bail of Peor, and the Lord was angry against
[time=2963] Israel.
[time=2964] The Lord said to Moses, take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight
[time=2970] before the Lord, so that the fierce anger of the Lord may turn away from Israel, because
[time=2976] remember in God's economy whenever they're sinned somebody has to pay, there has to be
[time=2982] a sacrifice.
[time=2986] So Moses said to the judges of Israel, each of you, slay his men who have joined themselves
[time=2993] to bail of Peor, then behold, one of the sons of Israel came and brought to his relatives
[time=3000] a Midianite woman, he brings her in to his relatives to do what they would do.
[time=3007] In the sight of Moses, he does this, and inside of all the congregation of the sons of Israel while they were weeping at the doorway of the tent of meeting, when Phineas, the son of Eliezer, the son of Aaron the priest sought, he rose from the midst of the congregation
[time=3022] and took a spear in his hand and he went after the man of Israel into the tent where he and
[time=3028] the woman were and pierced both of them through, we just went PG-13, the man of Israel and
[time=3036] the woman through the body, watch, so the plague that God had already evoked because
[time=3043] of the disobedience, so the plague on the sons of Israel was checked and those who died
[time=3049] by the plague were 24,000 people.
[time=3057] God killed in his holy and righteous anger because of the disobedience of the people.
[time=3067] These are hard-hearted, disobedient, statute-rejectors who knew better and he killed 24,000 of them.
[time=3080] And call me crazy, I think God cares a lot about obedience.
[time=3091] Moses says to them, and Moses says to you, listen, listen to the statutes and the judgments
[time=3104] which God has given you and do them so that you may live and not die, so that you can
[time=3114] have blessing and not punishment, the things God desires for you, which sometimes are difficult,
[time=3121] you and I understand that, but I'd rather be in the midst of difficult that God wanted and difficult that I brought on myself and then the verse goes on.
[time=3133] Go back to 4-1, it says right there that you may live and go in and take possession
[time=3147] of the land.
[time=3148] I'll just say this to you then we'll go.
[time=3151] Truth is God wanted to bless them.
[time=3153] He wanted to give them the best land and the best life they could have ever imagined.
[time=3159] All he asked was that they love and obey him and him alone.
[time=3166] Write these things down as we close this morning.
[time=3168] I want you to tell these to your kids, I want you to talk about it as a small group.
[time=3173] Obedience draws others toward God, do you understand that?
[time=3178] Look at Deuteronomy 4-5, "See I have taught you statutes and judgments just as the Lord
[time=3184] my God commanded me that you should do thus in the land where you are entering to possess
[time=3190] it.
[time=3191] So keep and do them.
[time=3192] For that is your wisdom and your understanding in the side of the peoples, all the nations who will hear all these statutes and they will say surely this great nation is a wise
[time=3202] and understanding people for what great nation is there that has a God so near to it as
[time=3208] is the Lord our God whenever we call on him or what great nation is there that has statutes
[time=3214] and judgments as righteous as this whole law which I'm setting before you today.
[time=3220] My friends there is a uniqueness.
[time=3223] This is true.
[time=3224] I wouldn't lie to you.
[time=3225] I've seen it.
[time=3226] Many of you have seen it.
[time=3227] There is a uniqueness, something compelling about someone whose life is devoted to obeying
[time=3235] God.
[time=3237] When you live out that life people see it and they ask about it and they're drawn to it
[time=3244] and God gets made to look good.
[time=3249] Obedience gets passed on, don't forget this.
[time=3252] Obedience my friends, now we're talking about kids, now we're talking about lineage, now we're talking about the next generation.
[time=3259] I want you to know Deuteronomy 4.9 says it, obedience gets passed on.
[time=3266] Verse 4.9 only give heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently.
[time=3270] What a great phrase, give heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently.
[time=3276] Keep it right so that you do not forget the things which your eyes have seen and they do
[time=3282] not depart from your heart all the days of your life, but make them known to your sons
[time=3289] and your grandsons.
[time=3292] I'm so thankful when I hear about classes being offered to new parents and parents of toddlers, growing kids, small groups here that are going on on Sunday mornings.
[time=3302] I'm so thrilled to see Janice leading a how to be a D6, a Deuteronomy 6 family during
[time=3308] our grow groups.
[time=3309] Thursday nights we've got Jesse, Hannah, our student ministry pastor leading a grow group on Sunday mornings.
[time=3315] It's about 30, 35 people and they're learning about a sticky faith that we can pass along,
[time=3322] deposit in and share with our adolescents.
[time=3324] You know, 30 percent, listen, 30 percent of believing high school kids that graduate stay
[time=3335] somewhat in the game, that freshman year of college.
[time=3341] You can do the math, 70 percent don't.
[time=3345] And when they surveyed the 30 percent and said, "How is it that you're hanging in there?
[time=3349] What is it that happened that allows you now at 19 to be standing for the most part pretty
[time=3356] faithful and pretty strong?
[time=3358] Was it your church experience?" And that wasn't the number one answer, I think it was three.
[time=3367] Or was it the mentors or the disciples that you had, the people who came alongside you
[time=3373] in your life, they said, "No, that was number two." The number one reason for the 30 percent that are somewhat stand at it, they said it.
[time=3384] The real genuine faith of their mother and father.
[time=3389] The real genuine faith that got lived out in authenticity and honesty and faithfulness.
[time=3398] All my friends, disobedience or obedience gets passed on.
[time=3406] Let's be faithful.
[time=3408] Disobedience number three, disobedience always creates separation.
[time=3412] I won't read it to you, but 23 to 28 talks about how, in essence, God foretold the wandering
[time=3420] and the unfaithfulness of Israel.
[time=3421] He knew when they went over into the land, it wouldn't go well that in time they would be taken captive again, sent into exile, and He describes the distance that gets created
[time=3433] when you are not faithful and when you disobey.
[time=3436] It's not a good thing, it always happens.
[time=3439] Disobedience in your marriage, happens with your kids, happens with your friends, happens with God.
[time=3444] Disobedience creates distance.
[time=3449] I hope this morning that there is in you maybe a renewed desire to follow Him in obedience.
[time=3458] You want to, then listen to the statutes and judgments of our good God, amen?
[time=3469] Be with us as we go, give us strength and courage, please.
[time=3472] Oh God, give us as much as we might need to be obedient, faithful people.
[time=3478] We're grateful for the parameters you've established.
[time=3481] We know it shows you a great love, and our hope is that we can love you back with our obedience and trust in your son's name we pray.
[time=3489] [AMEN] God bless you.
