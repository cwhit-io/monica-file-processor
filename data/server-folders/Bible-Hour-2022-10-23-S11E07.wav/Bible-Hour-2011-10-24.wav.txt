[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] Again, I'm Kelly Bird and I am so thankful for the chance to get to spend these few minutes with you.
[time=39] There's a couple of things that I want to pass along to you today, two things that are of great importance to me and I hope they'll be an encouragement to you.
[time=47] Number one, I want to remind you that just a few weeks ago, Blackhawk Ministries and mainly Blackhawk Christian School opened a brand new upscale resale store down at Georgetown Square.
[time=61] The name of our new store, this amazing enterprise that funnels all of its proceeds back into the ministry of Blackhawk Christian School is renew, renew, that's right.
[time=72] Head down to Georgetown Square on a couple of fronts.
[time=75] If you're looking for some household items, if you're looking for athletic equipment, if you're looking for clothes, if you're looking for furniture, office supplies, I'm telling you, anything you can think of is in our new renew resale store and you'll find it at great prices and all the proceeds come back into our ministry to help kids and their families at Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=98] On the other hand, if you've got items you'd like to donate, if you've got clothes, if you've got office supplies, if you've got furniture, I mean, anything, bring it down to the folks at Renew, they'd love to take that off your hands and we are so grateful for what God is already doing through that effort.
[time=116] Secondly today, I wanna just tell you this, in the message that you're about to hear, you're gonna hear me talk about and we're gonna come to something that many of you have heard for years and years and years and years and that is a study of the Ten Commandments.
[time=133] And I don't know what it is about the Ten Commandments today, I think sometimes we just view it as so antiquated.
[time=139] I think sometimes we might get hung up in our culture today on the idea of a commandment because we all wanna be autonomous and we all wanna kinda do what we wanna do and I think sometimes the Ten Commandments brings with it the idea of obedience and following authority and I think sometimes we cringe and pull back from that.
[time=160] But I wanna just encourage you today, the great truth of the Old Testament, the principles and the parameters that we talked about last week, these are all really good things.
[time=170] These are healthy things that God today still wants us to see and understand and follow.
[time=177] And so as we jump into the Ten Commandments, I want you just to take a fresh look at it.
[time=182] I really do, I'm praying that God would allow you today to really see these commandments in a new and meaningful way.
[time=190] They really can be, I believe, life-changing principles that can bring to your life in mind a level of guidance and wisdom and insight that we desperately need.
[time=201] So don't get all hung up on it, don't just in your mind, think about Charlton Heston and old movies, allow the great truth, the fresh truth of God's word today to make a difference in your heart and mind and life.
[time=217] God bless you, I'm glad you tuned in and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=221] Have a great week.
[time=222] - I'm getting married, I can't believe I'm saying that,
[time=228] well, it's not official but it's practically a done deal.
[time=232] For as long as I can remember, I have felt this huge missing piece in my life, just this huge missing part and now I have finally found the guy who completes me.
[time=245] Ever since I was a little girl, all I wanted was to get married and to raise a family and to have all the wonderful things that go along with that.
[time=252] And now I can see it.
[time=255] We'll grow old together, soul baits.
[time=260] Yes, I have found the man who I need, I have found the guy who will make me happy.
[time=268] Now, all I have to do is plan the wedding.
[time=271] I will be so happy when it's over.
[time=276] It started out so great.
[time=279] We had so much fun in the beginning.
[time=281] What happened?
[time=283] I don't know.
[time=284] Somewhere along the way we just stopped having fun.
[time=287] At least I stopped having fun.
[time=288] He just seemed to not care.
[time=290] In his mind, everything's probably fine, which is amazing to me because there is no spark, no life.
[time=297] I am so bored with everything.
[time=300] I feel like he's sucking the life right out of me.
[time=302] I just, I'm ready to do my own thing.
[time=308] I just wanna get out.
[time=310] I wanna get out and be happy and live life again.
[time=313] I know I could do that if I was just on my own.
[time=317] So, I'm done.
[time=319] I'm gonna be happy when...
[time=322] I get the promotion.
[time=324] This is the one.
[time=325] I've been working my tail off.
[time=327] This is what I've been working for for the past 12 years or however long you could spend.
[time=332] This is it.
[time=334] Finally, my chance to have the life.
[time=338] Things won't be so tight.
[time=340] We'll go on vacations.
[time=341] We'll have nice cars, the house.
[time=344] I know it sounds clich√©, but I mean, this is it.
[time=347] Well, finally, have the life.
[time=350] We'll be happy.
[time=351] My wife, my kids.
[time=354] We'll all be happy when...
[time=355] I slow down.
[time=357] I'm getting out.
[time=358] This is crazy.
[time=359] I got the big promotion.
[time=361] I have the house, the car.
[time=363] And don't even care about it anymore.
[time=365] I'm done with the rat race.
[time=366] I'm done with all this stuff we don't need.
[time=368] If it was up to me, I would sell everything tomorrow and just live a simple life.
[time=374] I mean, how great would that be?
[time=376] Well, that would do it.
[time=377] I could sell the house, get something small, get a used car, who really cares.
[time=383] Then I'd be able to spend more time with my family, my grandkids, if I just slowed down.
[time=389] How great would that be?
[time=393] That would do it.
[time=394] I would be happy if life were just simple.
[time=397] I will be so happy when I'm married.
[time=402] I'll be happy when I'm divorced.
[time=404] I'll be happy when I finally get that promotion.
[time=407] I'll be happy when life is simple.
[time=410] You dwell in the songs that we are singing,
[time=430] rising to the heavens, rising to your heart, your heart.
[time=439] Our praises filling up the spaces
[time=445] in between our frailty and everything you are.
[time=451] You are the keeper of my heart.
[time=459] In a restless, a restless,
[time=466] 'til I rest in you, 'til I rest in you.
[time=474] I am restless, a restless,
[time=481] 'til I rest in you, 'til I rest in you.
[time=488] Oh, God, I'm rest in you.
[time=499] Oh, sweet, now for my soul is listening,
[time=508] say that you have saved me, whisper in the dark, the dark, 'cause I know you're more than my salvation.
[time=522] Without you, I am hopeless.
[time=526] Tell me who you are.
[time=529] You are the keeper of my heart.
[time=544] In a restless, a restless,
[time=551] 'til I rest in you, 'til I rest in you.
[time=558] I am restless, a restless, 'til I rest in you, 'til I rest in you.
[time=578] I want to rest in you.
[time=587] Still my heart hold me close,
[time=594] let me hear a still small voice,
[time=601] let it grow, let it write into a shop,
[time=612] into a price, 'til my heart hold me close,
[time=622] let me hear a still small voice,
[time=630] let it grow, let it write into a shop,
[time=640] into a price,
[time=649] and I can't rest last, I'm restless, 'til I rest in you, 'til I rest in you,
[time=667] 'til I rest in you,
[time=675] 'til I rest in you, oh God.
[time=684] I want to rest in you.
[time=690] [MUSIC]
[time=703] Well hey, open your Bibles if you would this morning to Deuteronomy.
[time=707] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.
[time=712] We come to Deuteronomy 5 this morning.
[time=715] We began last week in Deuteronomy 4, the series title that we've landed on for the next several weeks is your best life now.
[time=724] We believe contrary to popular cultural opinion, we believe the best possible life you could ever have, the best possible life you could ever experience has nothing to do with a positive mental attitude so to speak.
[time=740] It's not a matter of you grabbing hold of your life and creating your own destiny if you will.
[time=746] It doesn't come when you go after what you want, when you want it, how you want it, know your best life now comes.
[time=755] When you are growing deeply in your love for God and out of that love for God comes a willingness and a readiness to obey Him, to follow Him in the everyday and in the all of your life.
[time=772] And that is exactly what God communicates to the people of Israel through Moses here on the plains of Moab.
[time=779] I told you last week Deuteronomy is all about God saying, "Here you go, folks, you're going to cross over this river." You are now entering into the land and to the life that I promised.
[time=790] And as you cross over, I want you to know what you're going to face.
[time=795] I know what's ahead and in light of all that you will encounter people of God.
[time=800] He says, "Here are the things I want you to know." "Here are the things I want you to do." "These are the things I want you to be devoted to." This is the kind of relationship I want to have with you.
[time=811] And so we will look at this.
[time=813] We started last week in Deuteronomy 4.
[time=816] We looked at the idea of statutes and principles that God had given.
[time=819] And now we come to Deuteronomy 5.
[time=822] And you know, in my almost 25 years of ministry experience, I've seen that sometimes when studying or talking about the Bible,
[time=832] people can get a little confused when it comes to the significance or the relevance or the place of the Old Testament.
[time=840] It's what we call it, the Old Testament.
[time=842] There are times when people get confused and have questions.
[time=845] I had a friend who came to faith later in life tell me once in a discussion
[time=851] that he and I were having about the Old Testament.
[time=854] He said to me, he said, "Keli, someone told me that it didn't count." He actually said that.
[time=860] He said, "Someone actually had told him that the Old Testament didn't count, as if old meant canceled or as if old meant replaced, which is not true at all." And I want to stand here this morning and just declare that to you all.
[time=874] Not true at all.
[time=876] You see the whole of God's story, the whole biblical text.
[time=884] Is one interwoven unfolding relevant revelation of God's relationship with his people.
[time=892] His redeeming love toward his people.
[time=898] The whole thing, old and new, is the story of God's redemptive loving plan
[time=904] to rescue and restore his people, to rescue and restore them into a life-changing relationship with him today and an eternal relationship with him forever.
[time=913] So it's all good.
[time=915] Both testaments needed and both helpful in our efforts to grow in our understanding
[time=922] of this good and great God who we serve.
[time=925] Now, having said that, I want to say this.
[time=927] Sometimes what's at the heart of the confusion when it comes to the Old Testament is when people start talking about, when pastors start teaching about, when there are conversations flying around about the law.
[time=942] Sometimes it's the law that kind of gets us a little off or a little wondering
[time=949] about the relevance of this whole thing.
[time=951] We hear about being under the law.
[time=954] We hear about the nation of Israel and the law.
[time=957] We hear about being subject to the law.
[time=960] And so I thought what we would do is just take a couple of minutes and just make sure in a few minutes we'll do our best to do what would really take a few hours.
[time=969] But just in a couple of minutes, I want to give you just maybe the ability to kind of wrap your arms around this idea of the law and the significance of it in the Old Testament,
[time=980] in the New Testament, in the whole of God's redemptive story.
[time=985] And we'll start by taking a law quiz.
[time=989] So get out a piece of paper.
[time=990] You could do this on a piece of paper with a pen.
[time=993] You could do it in your mind.
[time=994] I'm not going to have you raise your hands.
[time=995] Nobody's going to get embarrassed.
[time=997] But we're going to actually take a quiz to just see where you're at and your understanding of the law.
[time=1001] For the most part, I think it's pretty simple.
[time=1004] But hey, there's always those of us in the room who have room to learn and grow.
[time=1008] So here we go, the law of God.
[time=1011] The law of God was given to the Jews through A, Abraham, B, Joshua, C, Moses.
[time=1019] Just write that down, make a little mental note in your mind.
[time=1022] The law of God delivered to the Israelites through who?
[time=1026] Abraham, Joshua, or Moses.
[time=1028] Number two, the law of God is found in the last five books of the Old Testament.
[time=1034] In the first five books of the Old Testament, or is the law of God found in the first five books of the New Testament.
[time=1042] Number three, the Hebrew name for the law is the Torah, the Elohim, or the Mishvet.
[time=1050] The Torah, the Elohim, or the Mishvet, which is it A, B, or C.
[time=1055] And lastly, the purpose of the law was to drive people crazy with guilt, move people toward perfectionism and personal achievement, or expose the need people had for what?
[time=1069] Say it for forgiveness and a savior.
[time=1073] There is your law quiz.
[time=1075] And hopefully in the next few minutes here, I'll answer those for you.
[time=1080] And you can see how you did.
[time=1082] So the law, the Old Testament, how does all this work?
[time=1087] Okay, the law was known as the Mosaic law because it was not Abraham or Joshua.
[time=1095] It was Moses that God used to deliver to the nation of Israel, his requirements,
[time=1102] his rules, his regulations, his statutes, his judgments, his principles and parameters,
[time=1109] as we talked about last week, to each and every one of them.
[time=1112] God used Moses to deliver the law of God.
[time=1115] There was a way in which God wanted them to live.
[time=1124] And so he gave them the law.
[time=1126] I say live, I say worship, I say decide things, because there were three components to the law that Moses delivers to the nation of Israel.
[time=1136] There was a moral component.
[time=1138] In other words, there was a way God wanted you to choose.
[time=1141] There was a way he wanted you to live.
[time=1143] There were values he wanted you to possess.
[time=1145] And so he gave the people of God a moral component of the law.
[time=1150] There was a ceremonial component to the law.
[time=1154] There was a way God wanted them to worship.
[time=1157] There was a way he wanted the temple to function.
[time=1160] There was a way in which it was very important to him that it be done the way he designed it.
[time=1165] Morally, he wanted them to live a certain way.
[time=1167] Ceremonally, he wanted them to worship a certain way.
[time=1171] And then there was a judicial part to the law.
[time=1174] There were ways in which he wanted laws enacted.
[time=1177] There were ways in which he wanted those who broke those laws to be dealt with.
[time=1183] He didn't leave any stone unturned as you go through Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, especially you see the minutiae to which he dealt with these issues.
[time=1193] Moral, ceremonial, judicial law, a law that God designed to govern the hearts and lives
[time=1202] and relationships of the people in the nation of Israel.
[time=1207] The law itself, all this that God contained in what he wanted his people to see,
[time=1215] is found in what is known as the Torah.
[time=1219] Not the Elohim, that's the name of God, and not in the Mishvet, which I just made up.
[time=1224] I just thought it sounded Hebrew. It's not even a word.
[time=1227] So if you pick C, I got you.
[time=1229] The Torah, first five or some call it the Torah, the first five books of the Old Testament.
[time=1237] It is in those first five books that you find the moral, ceremonial, and judicial requirements of God for the hearts and lives of his people.
[time=1244] Now watch this. This is where it gets really cool.
[time=1248] If I, first of all, if I laid out for you on a piece of paper, if you will, if we wrote out all of the law, everything that it entailed, my goodness, it's significant.
[time=1261] It would be quite a volume of work.
[time=1263] And when you look at everything that God desired for his people, morally and ceremonially and judicially, here's the cool thing.
[time=1273] Matthew 5, 17 teaches us.
[time=1276] We see it here in the Gospels that Jesus himself says, "Do not think that I, Jesus Christ, came in any way to abolish all of that."
[time=1287] I didn't. He said, "No, I didn't come to abolish the law or the prophets,
[time=1293] the old scriptures. I did not come to abolish but to what?
[time=1299] Fulfill in one person, the Son of God. Everything that God requires of you,
[time=1311] everything that it requires of me is fulfilled in him." And all of it is fulfilled in him because it is clear.
[time=1321] It has been clear from the beginning.
[time=1324] It is clear today and it will be clear for as long as we're here that no one, not one of you and not one of them in any way, shape, or form,
[time=1336] had the capacity to fulfill all of God's moral, ceremonial, judicial law.
[time=1344] Amen? Nobody could have ever fulfilled it.
[time=1348] God knew that to be true of them. God knew it to be true of us.
[time=1352] It's why he gave them the sacrificial system and it's why he's given us sense the spotless lamb, the perfect lamb of God who came to die.
[time=1363] And in his life, death, and resurrection, he fulfills the entire law of God.
[time=1370] And now it gets even cooler.
[time=1372] Now the scriptures teach us that the law of God is written no longer on stone tablets,
[time=1380] if you will, but instead the scripture teaches us that the law of God, what he desires from us, what he requires of us, which hasn't been abolished.
[time=1391] No, not at all. It's only been fulfilled.
[time=1393] That law, the scripture says, is now written on your, what?
[time=1397] On your heart. Look at Hebrews, Hebrews chapter 10 versus 16 through 18.
[time=1403] It says, and you see it there on the screen, this is the covenant that I will make with them after those days.
[time=1411] Those days were then now after those days.
[time=1415] He says, I will put my laws upon their heart and on their mind, I will write them.
[time=1423] It goes on in verse 17 to say, and their sins and their lawless deeds.
[time=1430] I will remember no more.
[time=1432] And he finishes in 18 now where there is forgiveness of these things.
[time=1438] There is no longer any offering for sin.
[time=1440] This is an amazing truth that the law of God is now written on our hearts.
[time=1445] And there is forgiveness available not because of your ability or mind to complete or fulfill it.
[time=1451] It's already been fulfilled.
[time=1454] Jesus kept everything.
[time=1457] Jesus did it right.
[time=1458] Jesus passed the test.
[time=1461] The law of God has been fulfilled in the person of Christ and you and I get to experience that
[time=1467] if and when you and I are in who? Christ.
[time=1471] Man.
[time=1473] So the fulfilled law of God, look at Hebrews 810, same thing.
[time=1479] Hebrews 810, for this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel.
[time=1483] After those days, says the Lord, I will put my laws into their minds,
[time=1489] and I will write them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
[time=1498] So the fulfilled law of God is in us.
[time=1501] It's on our hearts, and while it's true that there is now a new covenant between God and his people,
[time=1508] that we are no longer under the Mosaic law, we are no longer under or binded to that.
[time=1515] One must remember, while all that's true, one must remember that in the Old Testament,
[time=1522] there is still great truth, important spiritual principles to be reminded of.
[time=1531] The statutes and judgments of God.
[time=1534] I want you to hold your Bible.
[time=1539] I'm not going to get weird here, don't worry.
[time=1541] Just want you to hold your Bible, and I just want you to look at it, and I want you just to take just a minute here this morning, and I just want to remind you, as you hold it, it's all, it's all good. All of it is for us today. There is a way in which we interpret it,
[time=1557] there is a way in which we study it from the vantage point that we have now standing where we
[time=1563] stand looking at all of redemptive history, and that allows us to look at things like the Old
[time=1569] Testament and a study of Deuteronomy. It allows us to look at the things even within the law,
[time=1576] and to understand that while we no longer are subject to the Mosaic law, as it was originally
[time=1583] given to the people of Israel, the principles therein, and the truth that those principles
[time=1589] represent are as binding and as beneficial and as helpful as they've ever been. Amen?
[time=1595] All of us need to understand this. Romans 15 and 4, I love the way Paul said this to the
[time=1602] church at Rome here in the New Testament era, he says, for whatever it was written in what?
[time=1608] Earlier times was written for our instruction so that through perseverance and the encouragement
[time=1618] of the scriptures, there you go, we might have hope. What was written in ancient times, my friends,
[time=1627] so very, very helpful, which is important for us this morning as we come to Deuteronomy 5,
[time=1634] and you know what's in Deuteronomy 5? The Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments, half of the
[time=1645] room just flashed a picture of Charlton Heston in your mind. The Ten Commandments is what we're
[time=1654] going to look at this morning. Actually, you know what? We're not going to look at all the Ten, we're going to look at five, and we're going to do this a little differently today. I can't wait to see how it goes, and I hope it will encourage many of you to jump in on this. You're
[time=1666] going to hear the first five this morning. The second five are going to come later in the week in our Digging Deeper resource that we make available to all of you every week on our website.
[time=1677] Digging Deeper is a resource that Steve Webster and others take part in constructing for us. It's a
[time=1683] study tool. It's a devotional tool. It's a chance for every one of you to go to the website on Wednesday and download it or just look at it right there on the screen. It's a continuation of every Sunday's message. Every week you can go to the website Wednesday Thursday, go to the Digging Deeper,
[time=1699] and you can kind of pick up, if you will, where we left off. It gives you further study, further reflection, a chance to think more specifically about application. It is a great resource. You
[time=1710] should use it personally. You should use it in your small group, in your class, with your family.
[time=1715] But the other five are going to come at the end of the week, and so this morning we come to the
[time=1721] first five commandments in the 10 commandments. I don't know what comes to your mind when you hear me say the 10 commandments. But in many ways, these commands from God to His people represented
[time=1734] the overarching heart and mind of God when it came to what He wanted for His people. This is
[time=1741] where it really begins. This is what loving God and loving others looks like. They asked
[time=1747] Jesus in the New Testament. They said, "Jesus, what's the most important? What's the most important command of all?" And many of you know what Jesus said. He said, "The number one command is loving God." Love Him with all your heart, Jesus said. "The second most important is loving others." And isn't it not ironic that the 10 commandments are first four all about loving who?
[time=1770] God, last six all about loving who? Others. Very intentional, very purposeful, as God delivers
[time=1780] His heart to His people, the way in which He wanted them to live not only with Him but with
[time=1787] each other. This is what would, and I want to make sure you hear this, you think you hear 10
[time=1794] commandments? Sometimes we think, "Oh, a plaque on a wall in an old school building." We think 10 commandments, and we kind of go political sometimes. We hear 10 commandments. Some
[time=1806] of us in the room, we hear in this culture, we hear commandment, and we kind of recoil
[time=1812] because it sounds like obedience, and it goes against the grain of our autonomous thinking that sets us up in the world today to kind of do what we want to do and go where we want to go, as long as we feel good about it. Commandments, the 10 commandments, sometimes the antiquity of
[time=1829] it, sometimes the feel of it leaves us a little gun shy. I want you to understand that these
[time=1837] commands that God gave His people were right in line with what I've told you before was His eternal
[time=1845] and most important purpose for Him and His people. You see, He wanted His people to live a certain
[time=1851] life. He wanted His people to live in relationship with Him in a certain way. He wanted them to function
[time=1859] in the midst of all these nations in a way that would draw them the nations to this God,
[time=1867] and He understood that the way in which this would happen is if they followed His Word,
[time=1873] if they followed His heart, and if they would, if they would obey His commandments, then not only
[time=1882] would they, His people begin to take on a uniqueness in the world, but God, the one who delivers,
[time=1892] the author of these commandments would begin to be Himself seen and understood as the unique
[time=1899] set-apart holy God that He was. So this wasn't about rules, and this wasn't about some
[time=1906] big God up in the sky who wanted people running around at His feet, just doing the stuff that He said. Oh, there was great divine and redemptive purpose. And so let's jump in. Let's jump in
[time=1919] with number one, right out of the gate, verse 7, Deuteronomy 5, the first one,
[time=1926] you, my people, you people who I love, He said, you shall have no other gods before me. No gods
[time=1938] in your life, in your heart, over and above me. And I love, I love how He sets it up.
[time=1949] He sets up verse 7 with verse 6. And if you look at 5, 6, it says, I am the Lord your God.
[time=1955] Remember this people. I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
[time=1962] out of the house of slavery. Do you see that? He says, remember what I did. Remember the spot
[time=1970] you were in. Remember the hundreds of years of slavery and bondage. Remember how bad it was.
[time=1977] Remember how you were abused. Remember how you were mistreated. And I, the Lord your God,
[time=1983] did what no one else can do. Pharaoh tried to stand up to me. The most powerful man on the earth.
[time=1990] And I squished him. There wasn't anybody. There wasn't anything anyone could do. I came in.
[time=1997] I rescued you. I went over and above what was humanly conceivable. The plagues and Moses and
[time=2006] the trip out and the sea and the whole horses and the waves and the way through.
[time=2012] He's reminding them of who He is and what He did.
[time=2019] And I have friends who I'm in spiritual discussions with. And I see things that get written and there's
[time=2029] folks who just kind of look at that verse. I am the Lord your God and you will have no other
[time=2035] gods before me. And they say, you know, look at that. He's so egotistical, Kelly. He sounds like an egomaniac. And if all you do is read that verse, if all you do is look at that without the
[time=2047] context of the story of God and His people, you might say, well, yeah, it does. But no, when you look at six and when you realize all that He has provided them with and all that they had
[time=2058] experienced, there's no ego at all. He loves them and He's gone to great links to save them. And now
[time=2066] He's leading them to a place where He knows what's waiting. No ego. It's like me getting ready to
[time=2076] go into Disney World with five kids. It's like, you know, me getting ready to go into a Michigan
[time=2084] state game these days. It's like, I'll tell you what, it's like me, if I ever went back to the
[time=2091] Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., where six years ago, at the age of five, with 10,000 people all over,
[time=2104] Jake Bird walked away at the Smithsonian. He just walked away. You know, he let go of the
[time=2115] pant leg and he got curious and there were other things going on. And within minutes,
[time=2122] you realize that your five-year-old son in Washington, D.C., at the Smithsonian, is gone.
[time=2131] So like within, you know, seconds I got, I got four kids crying who had just been told, not quietly, to sit down against the wall. I got a wife who's trying to keep it together.
[time=2142] I've lost it. And she's calmly walking through the halls of the Smithsonian, just trying to find
[time=2149] him. I am yelling. I am screaming my brains out in the Smithsonian, trying to find my son.
[time=2159] And 20 minutes goes by. Now it's starting to be time to call the authorities. Now you're starting
[time=2169] to figure out what in the world you're going to do. And then all of a sudden, through these doors, comes Jake, a sucker in his mouth and a cop, policeman on his hand. So it all turned out.
[time=2184] All turned out. And so now, if we were to go back to the Smithsonian, I would say,
[time=2190] "I am your God." I would say, "You will follow me. You will not let go of me."
[time=2202] Because I am in charge, because as my child and God is saying to you as his children,
[time=2208] I don't want you to get what? Lost. And I am here today simply guaranteeing you again,
[time=2216] reminding you and loving you by saying if you let go of him, if you don't follow and obey him,
[time=2222] if you put another God in front of him, you will get lost. And there will be people crying
[time=2232] against a wall. There will be others out screaming their brains out trying to find you. There will be destruction and hurt and sorrow in your wake when you, in your foolishness or me and mine, dare
[time=2244] to follow someone or something else. You shall not, number two, make for yourself an idol.
[time=2253] You shall not make for yourself an idol. Let's just look at verses 8, 9, and 10. So insightful.
[time=2261] And I think it speaks for itself. I'll just read it. You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any lightness of what is in heaven above, or on the earth beneath, or in the water under the
[time=2273] earth. You shall not worship them or serve them. For I, the Lord, your God, I'm a jealous God,
[time=2280] visiting the iniquity of the fathers, on the children, and on the third and the fourth generation
[time=2290] of those who what? Wow, this just got really interesting, because now what that's telling you
[time=2297] is that if you're willing, and if you're committed to putting another God, little G above him,
[time=2306] capital G. And then he's saying, in essence, that once you do that, once you put a God above God,
[time=2312] then you're going to, in time, begin to what? You're going to begin to worship that God. And when you
[time=2318] put another God in front of him and begin to worship that God, you like to think, and I like to say,
[time=2324] that simply us exercising our autonomy. We like to think of that as a choice that we make.
[time=2331] God says that when you do that, you simply evidence the fact that you hate him, that you hate God. When in the midst of the Smithsonian, at the age of five, you think you've
[time=2347] got a better shot on your own. And the fourth, third and fourth generation, the kids don't
[time=2359] misunderstand that. That's not God saying that he punishes your children. He's not
[time=2367] disciplining you by hurting your kids. It's not what that means. What that means is that your next
[time=2375] generation and the generations that come after that are most definitely influenced. They're bent,
[time=2383] they're leaning, they're thinking, all of it influenced by the way you obey or the way you
[time=2391] disobey. And God is simply visiting upon them. God is simply seeing in them the results of the
[time=2399] unfaithfulness and the disobedience of his people. And when it happens and when it's a pattern, it has a tendency to move on. And so together we work by God's grace and with his help
[time=2413] to move in the other direction. Don't make an idol.
[time=2423] I'm a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers but showing loving kindness to thousands,
[time=2430] to those who love me and keep my commandments. Those who love me, not those who hate me,
[time=2438] they made little carved images. They tried to somehow create what they made these little idols.
[time=2448] And they worshiped them. We buy stuff. We worship material stuff. Or we find somebody. We worship
[time=2463] cars. We worship homes. We worship boyfriends. We try to find all the joy and all the satisfaction
[time=2474] and all the fulfillment that God in his law says you can have in me when you walk in loving, obedient relationship with me. We say, no, we're going to go find it. We're going to go find it in a vacation. If you have other gods before you, you start to worship them.
[time=2493] That's how it goes. You're not going to carve a little image and put it up on your mantle, but you are going to be an idolater when in that situation your affection and your loyalty and
[time=2504] your pursuits and your desire and your drive are found in anything or any one else besides him.
[time=2510] Number three, you shall not take or speak. You shall not take the name of the Lord in vain.
[time=2518] Verse 11, you shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain for the Lord will not leave
[time=2524] him unpunished who takes his name in vain. What does this mean to take the Lord's name in vain?
[time=2533] And if I said to everybody here, hey, what's that mean? To take the Lord's name in vain, most of you would say it means to cuss, swear using God's name in the midst of your cussing.
[time=2543] For the most part, you're kind of in the ballpark, all right? But I want you to hear and see this
[time=2550] morning, the literal interpretation of this, because I think it's very important that you understand that it is that, but it's more than that. To take the name of God in vain,
[time=2562] it's when the name of the Lord, it really means that the name of the Lord shall not be attached
[time=2569] to anything empty or evil. Do not attach the name of God to anything that comes out of your mouth
[time=2581] that's empty or evil. Don't bring God's name into your anger. Don't bring the name of God into
[time=2591] your dirty jokes. Don't bring God's name into your casual, empty, meaningless conversations.
[time=2598] And I'm going to sound like a broken record, but just bear with me. Remember, remember, he wanted
[time=2606] to be unique. He wanted to be holy. He wants to be set apart. He wants to be held up in a place
[time=2615] that's like no other gods. So don't bring him into this common, every day, useless, senseless,
[time=2624] vile stuff. Don't do that to him, cussing sure, but also in other ways where his name gets brought
[time=2634] into stuff that has absolutely nothing at all to do with him. Do not take the name of the Lord
[time=2641] in vain. Be careful how you use his name. Number four, you shall keep the Sabbath holy.
[time=2650] You shall keep the Sabbath holy. Watch this, my friends. Observe verse 12. Observe the
[time=2656] Sabbath has to do with rest. Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy. And I'm going to stop right
[time=2664] there and just remind you that the word holy means set apart. The word holy means not like anything else. And in the conversation here, which is talking about the days of the week,
[time=2675] the clear implication is that this day, whatever this day might be, is to be like no other day.
[time=2684] So there's to be a day in your life and mine that looks like and feels like and is like
[time=2698] no other day. There is to be a holy day.
[time=2705] Look at verse 12 and 14, 12 through 14. Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy
[time=2715] as the Lord your God commanded you. Six days, you shall labor and do all your work. But the seventh
[time=2721] day is a Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it, you shall not do any work. You are your son
[time=2728] or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant or your ox or your donkey or
[time=2735] any of your cattle or your sojourner traveler who stays with you so that your male servant and
[time=2743] your female servant may rest as well as you. Stop there. Do you think he meant this? Do you think a day
[time=2754] of rest was important to him? Do you think he saw it as vital for his people? I think so.
[time=2761] He's in essence saying, hey everybody, everybody, everything, everything you own,
[time=2767] everywhere you are, your whole home, your whole house, everybody in your house, stop.
[time=2771] Rest. And I think it's interesting that for years and years and years,
[time=2780] I always felt like that was kind of the end of the discussion. God wanted you to spiritually
[time=2786] and God desired that we would emotionally and physically rest because we worked those six days
[time=2793] and our minds and our hearts and our bodies needed the rest to be the people that he wanted us to be.
[time=2799] I think that's true. I get that. But then this is interesting. Don't forget this. He goes on in
[time=2805] verse 15. Look at the text. He says in 15, you shall remember in this discussion of Sabbath,
[time=2813] you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt and the Lord your God brought you
[time=2821] out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm. Therefore, the Lord your God commanded you
[time=2829] to observe the Sabbath day. Wow. What he's saying there is that Sabbath isn't just about rest.
[time=2839] Sabbath really also is about Thanksgiving. And we kind of feel like we've done a good deed
[time=2847] by setting aside one day cooking a bunch of food and watching football. And he's saying,
[time=2853] no, no, no, no. There should be a day every week in your life where yes, you rest for physical,
[time=2859] spiritual, and emotional recharging. But there should be a day when you stop and thank God for
[time=2865] the mirey pit he saved you out of, where you thank God for his outstretched arm that rescued
[time=2873] you from the sin that you were lost in. The people of Israel were lost in the futility of Egypt.
[time=2881] You and I were lost in the futility of Satan's domain in the darkness, whatever that looked like for you. I know what it looked like for me. And Sabbath here is connected to your salvation.
[time=2893] And there should be a day in the week set apart where you and I spend being thankful for his deliverance and his rescue from the darkness of that day. I believe there
[time=2905] should be a day in your life and mine when we rest from the schedule, from the demands, from the activities, from the driving. Do I hear an amen, moms? From the job, a day to press pause on the
[time=2919] pressures and the expectations of others. I believe for one day we should physically and spiritually
[time=2925] step away and slow down. A chance to, as it says in Psalm 46, be what? Be still and know that he is
[time=2934] God. To be still and know that he is God. I'll just say this to you. I said it first hour,
[time=2943] so maybe it'll be a little easier to say it second hour. I am your pastor, your teacher, your shepherd, one who God has asked to lead you. In all things, I am horrible. I am failing God
[time=2959] and failing you and failing myself and failing my marriage and failing my family miserably.
[time=2965] If I'm going to take this to be applicable, if I'm going to stand here and say that you should do
[time=2972] this, I'm just telling you, I don't. Nearly, nearly as much as I should. And we have, I'm afraid,
[time=2980] we have created even a Christian culture, if you will. Not to mention the other culture we live in
[time=2988] and all that we've bought into there. See, we're so busy. We've got so many irons in the fire.
[time=2994] We have chosen to connect to so many things that to stop in the midst of it for a day seems absolutely
[time=3003] what? It seems ludicrous. Did you hear that? Did you feel that? And that's how far we've fallen,
[time=3013] that we look at something God has designed for us to engage in to a degree. Again, I understand this isn't the Mosaic law anymore for us, but I'm telling you there's a principle here that I think I should pay more attention to. The shoe fits where? But we've come so far away from it that when we
[time=3031] actually talk about it and it's saying like this, we say it sounds ludicrous. Something designed by
[time=3038] him to help us sounds ridiculous. And that's how far I think we've moved away from his design
[time=3047] for a day where we step back, shut it down to a degree and rest. Last one, fifth one,
[time=3062] other five coming this week. Honor your father and your mother. God designed for his people
[time=3070] to be a people who would be raised in such a way where it was taught from the beginning that you were to honor your father and your mother. The people of Israel needed this. I think sometimes
[time=3083] we think we created dysfunction. Okay, we didn't create dysfunctional families. We didn't create
[time=3090] family tension. We didn't create moms and dads that sometimes make it hard. We didn't create disobedient kids. It's been going on from the very beginning. Cain and Abel, how's that? We'll go to that later. Listen to this. It says in 516, it says, "Honor your father and your mother as the
[time=3106] Lord your God has commanded you that your days may be prolonged." Paul said this is the one that
[time=3113] came with a promise that your days may be prolonged and that it may go well with you
[time=3120] on the land which the Lord your God gives you. I'll just say this and then we're going to wrap it up.
[time=3127] Honor your father and your mother. Oftentimes people want to know, Kelly, what does that mean?
[time=3132] Like what does that actually practically look like? I'll just give you a few things here. When you're younger, okay, and younger, for those of you in the room, I'm just kind of ball parking it around, you know, like 18, somewhere in there, younger. When you're younger, honoring them is directly tied to obeying them, obeying them faithfully.
[time=3157] When you're older, honoring them is directly tied to showing them gratitude, respect, and preference
[time=3169] whenever possible. 30 and 40-year-olds in the room just latch on to that one,
[time=3177] gratitude, respect, preference. I'm not leaving out 50-year-olds, 50-year-olds, you know,
[time=3186] many of you have parents, they're still alive. Sometimes as we all get older, sometimes this
[time=3192] doesn't get what? Easier. So this is just a reminder to those of you in the room with parents.
[time=3201] If you're older, graciousness, respect, preference, whenever you can to whatever degree you can,
[time=3210] younger, directly tied to obeying them faithfully. To honor your father and mother is to speak highly
[time=3217] of them. You say, well, I can't speak highly of them. Why? Well, because they did this and because they did that and because they're like this. And I would take issue with that and we can talk
[time=3229] about it more later, but I would encourage you. I would say that no matter, I would say that for
[time=3236] the most part, no matter what they've done, you can today not deride them and vilify them
[time=3245] and disrespect them and dishonor them in your speech about them. I think you can
[time=3251] rise above a bit. And in an effort to honor God and His word, I think you can speak nicely of them.
[time=3261] Fourthly, always be willing to defer to them. There's a sense in our relationships with them,
[time=3271] where we get opportunities to defer or do what we want. And this could be where to go to dinner,
[time=3277] this could be where to go on vacation, this could be where to meet for Christmas. I don't care.
[time=3281] I'm just saying there's a way in which we can honor when the when the when the pattern is, I'll defer to them. It means to treat with reverence, to show, to show
[time=3296] partiality to them, to hold them up and high esteem by your actions, your words, and your thoughts.
[time=3302] Here you go, listen, honoring your father and mother means making them feel valuable, and there's a way you can do that. You can help them feel and sense that they are valuable.
[time=3312] Now I'll end with this. There are people in this world, my friends. There are mothers and there are
[time=3318] fathers who are evil. There are moms and dads out there who, with 10-year-olds and 20-year-olds and
[time=3329] 50-year-olds, are evil. And there is a way, I believe, and we try and help folks with it here
[time=3338] at Black Hawk, there is a way we can help you navigate that road. I believe there is a way you
[time=3344] can honor an evil parent, but that takes some discussion, that takes some wisdom,
[time=3351] that takes some help. And so if, in fact, that's the case that you're dealing with,
[time=3357] we'd love to be able to help you honor God's command to honor them and would love to encourage
[time=3363] you personally on that front. So just let us know if we can help. Aside from evil parents,
[time=3371] we may just be dealing with difficult ones at times and God's encouragement to you today
[time=3378] as you deal with difficulty on that front is to be humble and to be long-suffering
[time=3384] and to be gracious and to honor your mom and dad. It is a command that carries with it
[time=3390] quite a promise, a promise that I think most of you, as you read the text here, would want to experience in your own life. I know I want to in mine. Would you stand and let me
[time=3401] pray for us this morning, Father, in heaven? As we stand today, we stand grateful for the fact
[time=3407] that your word, either testament, is so very true and so very right and it is filled with such
[time=3415] benefit for us and our efforts to love you and honor you and love and honor others in our lives.
[time=3421] Oh, God, we pray that as we leave today, you would give us great strength to be people who don't recoil from commandments but embrace them and see them for all the value and all the worth that
[time=3433] they bring. Oh, Father, we pray that as we look at these five, even more so in the next couple of
[time=3441] days, and as we look at the other five that will come later in the week online, God, I pray that you would do a work in us that would allow us to kind of reconnect with these commandments that
[time=3452] you gave so long ago to a people who you loved so deeply. God, we know we are the recipients of that
[time=3460] deep and abiding love today and so we thank you. We commit to holding on to your pant leg. We
[time=3470] commit to following you where you go because we don't want to be without you. Don't want to be on
[time=3476] our own. God, we want to live an intimacy with you and so help us and give us strength to do that very thing and all the people agreed and said, "Hey, man, God bless you. We'll see you next week."
[time=3506] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
