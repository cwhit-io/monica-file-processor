[time=553] - Well, if you have your Bible's turned to Deuteronomy 6 this morning, it is good to be with you, specifically in this role,
[time=565] this morning I typically sit over there somewhere and I was just even reflecting this morning, just how grateful I am for Blackhawk.
[time=575] As I think about, I turned 39 years old a couple of weeks ago.
[time=580] You know, my sixth grade teacher, when Keaton's over there, I can't believe that, can you?
[time=584] But just thankful for this place.
[time=588] Growing up here, going to the school, kindergarten through 12th grade, and at the church every time the doors were opened, church used to be over there, and sitting and listening to David Jeremiah, and then from him, Rick Hawks, and my youth pastor was John Sootch, and then Russell Moore, and Russell Moore was probably one of the greatest reasons outside of God that I went to seminary, just thought so highly of him, and went to the seminary he went to, followed along there, and now Kelly as well.
[time=619] So I'm just really grateful for Blackhawk, and really grateful to God for all that he's done, and then even just today, a special privilege and honor to be able to teach God's word with you, and learn with you today.
[time=629] So Deuteronomy 6, I believe that Deuteronomy 6 is all about God prescribing a specific way of life.
[time=639] And that this life was designed by God for his people's good, and their obedience to this life, which was for their good,
[time=651] was to be motivated by his redemption.
[time=656] In order to get at these claims this morning, we're going to ask three questions from the passage.
[time=663] Those three questions are this.
[time=665] What is God asking his people to do?
[time=668] Secondly, why is he asking them to do this?
[time=673] And then thirdly, how are they going to do this?
[time=679] As we move through these questions and answers, we'll notice also their great relevance and impact to us today.
[time=688] So let's read Deuteronomy 6 together.
[time=690] We're just going to take our time and read the entire passage of Scripture, and I'll start in verse 1, Deuteronomy 6.
[time=699] Now this is the commandment, and these are the statutes and judgments which the Lord your God has commanded to teach you, that you may observe them in the land which you are crossing over to possess, that you may fear the Lord your God to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you.
[time=715] You and your son and your grandson all the days of your life, and that your days may be prolonged.
[time=722] Therefore, here, O Israel, and be careful to observe it, that it may be well with you and that you may multiply greatly as the Lord God of your fathers has promised you, a land flowing with milk and honey.
[time=733] Verse 4, "Here, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[time=738] You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength.
[time=744] And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart.
[time=748] You shall teach them diligently to your children, shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way, when you lie down and when you rise up, you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
[time=762] You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
[time=766] So it shall be when the Lord your God brings you into the land of which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you large and beautiful cities which you did not build.
[time=777] House is full of all good things which you did not fill.
[time=781] Hewn out wells which you did not dig vineyards, and olive trees which you did not plant.
[time=786] When you have eaten and are full, then beware.
[time=790] Must you forget the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
[time=794] From the house of bondage, you shall fear the Lord your God and serve him and shall take oaths in his name.
[time=801] You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who are all around you.
[time=806] For the Lord your God is a jealous God among you, lest the anger of the Lord your God be aroused against you and destroy you from the face of the earth.
[time=815] You shall not tempt the Lord your God as you tempted him in Massah.
[time=819] You shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God, his testimonies, and his statues which he has commanded you, and you shall do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord, that it may be well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land of which the Lord swore to your fathers, to cast out all your enemies from before you as the Lord has spoken.
[time=840] Verse 20, "When your son asked you in time to come, saying,
[time=847] 'What is the meaning of the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments which the Lord our God has commanded you?' Then you shall say to your son, 'We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and the Lord showed signs and wonders before our eyes, great and severe against Egypt, Pharaoh, and all his household.
[time=870] Then he brought us out from there that he might bring us in, to give us the land of which he swore to our fathers, and the Lord commanded us to observe all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God for our good always, that he might preserve us alive as it is to this day.
[time=890] Then it will be righteousness for us if we are careful to observe all these commandments before the Lord our God as he has commanded us." Let's pray.
[time=903] Father, we're so thankful for your word.
[time=905] We're thankful for just even the freedom and ability to read and to listen to truth, which is only found in you.
[time=913] We're thankful for your spirits, again, who opens our eyes to the truth and helps us to understand and thankful for your son and his work, which even allows the spirit to indwell us through his redemption.
[time=929] God, we come before you this morning all of that to say, we're just needy people.
[time=936] We're it not for you and for your truth and for your spirit and for your son.
[time=943] We would not be able to know truth.
[time=945] We would not be able to respond to your truth, and we would be lost.
[time=950] And yet we're so grateful that you have given us life.
[time=956] You have given us everything that we need in your son, and so we come to you this morning eagerly anticipating you speaking and leading us,
[time=966] opening our eyes to see and our ears to hear great and wonderful truth from you, God.
[time=972] And so help each and every one of us.
[time=975] It's in Christ's name that we pray. Amen.
[time=979] So the first question that we come to you again is what is God asking his people to do?
[time=984] It comes in Deuteronomy 4 through 9, and he's asking them to do two things.
[time=991] First of all, he's asking them to know him truly for who he really is,
[time=997] and then secondly, he's asking them to love him completely.
[time=1001] Look at verse 4 as we look at the first one.
[time=1003] It says this, "Here, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one."
[time=1009] This is what is referred to as the Shema, which is one of the most quoted passages for Jews.
[time=1017] In fact, devout Jews recite the Shema at least two times per day, and all that Shema means is it's a Hebrew word.
[time=1024] And if you were to open up the Hebrew Bible to Deuteronomy 6, 4, and if you had been trained in Hebrew and if you somehow remembered it after all those years,
[time=1034] then you would know that Shema is just a Hebrew word for here, O, and then the verse goes, "Shema Israel, here, O Israel." And so this is one of the most fundamental passages for the Jews, and all that God is trying to say is this, that the Lord is one.
[time=1052] Now what does it mean by one when you look at Deuteronomy 6, 4?
[time=1055] I believe that when you look at the context and look at the understanding of that word, it means that He is the only one.
[time=1063] It means that there is only one God, that there is none other beside Him, means that He is infinitely and eternally perfect, self-existent and self-sufficient.
[time=1075] That there are no other gods. In fact, as you think about the current day and time, there were little gods all over the place depending on what culture that they might have run into, but all of those gods what God is saying are made up.
[time=1090] They're pretend.
[time=1093] They're there as the figment of some culture's imagination to somehow try to accomplish what they're wanting to accomplish for their current circumstances,
[time=1104] or for better circumstances. And what God is saying is this, back to Genesis 1-1, in the beginning God, He was at the beginning and He is going to be the only one left at the end.
[time=1116] There's no other God. In fact, Zechariah 14 talks about that, and in Zechariah 14-9 it says this,
[time=1122] and the Lord will be king over all the earth. In that day the Lord will be the only one,
[time=1129] and His name, the only one.
[time=1133] From beginning to end there is no one else but the God of Israel.
[time=1139] And He wanted His people to know that He alone was God.
[time=1146] And no matter what they come into contact with the other cultures, with the other races, with the other, with the other peoples, no matter what other gods were there, they're not real.
[time=1156] But He and He alone is God, which is huge in that day.
[time=1162] There was a God for everything, a sea God, a wind God. I mean, you name it.
[time=1167] They came up with these gods. And as I thought about it, it's not much different than today, right?
[time=1174] I mean, we make counterfeit gods out of all different types of stuff.
[time=1183] Our spouse, our careers, our bank accounts, our image, our abilities,
[time=1189] a destination that we're trying to get to, anything we look to in order to find fulfillment,
[time=1195] anything that we are looking to define lasting joy.
[time=1200] In other words, if this thing were taken away, whether it's our spouse, or our career, or our bank account, our image, our abilities, if it were taken away then our life would be miserable.
[time=1212] If it's true of something in your life, it has become a counterfeit God, has become a fake God.
[time=1218] And what God is telling His people and what God tells us again today, that there's only one God.
[time=1223] He alone is the one who will bring true fulfillment.
[time=1227] He's the only one that can satisfy the longings of your heart. He is God.
[time=1233] In fact, 1 John 5, it's interesting.
[time=1237] The very end of 1 John 5, just kind of out of the blue, he ends it with this little children.
[time=1244] Guard yourselves from idols.
[time=1247] Period. And he's done with the book. Just kind of came out of the blue.
[time=1252] In fact, the context of verse 20 and before that has nothing to do with that little phrase at the end, guard yourself from idols because he would know our propensity to make gods of our own.
[time=1264] So God was calling them, first of all, to know Him truly.
[time=1268] Secondly, He was calling them His people to love Him completely.
[time=1273] Look at verses 5 through 9, it says this.
[time=1276] "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength." We sang that this morning. We understand what that means.
[time=1284] Basically, with all of who we are, our mind, our inner person, everything, all of that is to be motivated
[time=1293] and worshiping God.
[time=1295] It's not just a Sabbath event.
[time=1300] It was prescribed by Jesus even in the New Testament in Matthew 22 as the greatest commandment.
[time=1306] There was all of the law and prophets depended upon this, that we would love the Lord our God with everything
[time=1312] that we are, our mind, our will, our emotions.
[time=1315] This was obedience and devotion as you look at verses 6 through 9.
[time=1321] It says this, "These words which I command you today shall be in your heart." So it was internal, not external, but you shall teach them diligently to your children.
[time=1329] Talk of them when you sit and when you're in your house.
[time=1331] Basically, this obedience in this devotion was to be in your family life.
[time=1337] It was also to be in your private life and in your public life.
[time=1341] It was to be at night and first thing in the morning.
[time=1344] It was to be something that was to be constantly remembered by you as you would place the truth of God
[time=1350] on your hands and on your foreheads and on the doorposts of your house.
[time=1355] That would be a constant reminder of what God is calling you to.
[time=1362] It was a pervasive, fundamental approach to life.
[time=1367] Basically saying you can't segment your life, people of Israel, to say, "Hey, on the Sabbath, that's God when I give you the attention and the devotion that you deserve." But these other days I'm just going to be doing my own thing and interacting with the other races and doing what I please.
[time=1382] No, what he's saying is every aspect of your life is to be honoring to me as an act of worship.
[time=1390] He comes back in the New Testament for us in Romans 12-1 where he says, "Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice."
[time=1401] Same idea, the idea that you and I, because of the grace of God, get up on the altar and say, "God, my life is yours." Every segment, every aspect, there's nothing that's not yours.
[time=1412] There's nothing that would come out of the purview of you and your goodness to me.
[time=1422] To love him completely.
[time=1423] So what was God asking his people to do?
[time=1427] He was asking them to know him for who he truly is, the one God,
[time=1433] and love him with all that they were, everything that they were.
[time=1438] It leads us to question two.
[time=1441] Why is he asking them to do this?
[time=1445] For what purpose?
[time=1447] Well, as you look specifically in the context of Deuteronomy 6, I think it gives an answer to that
[time=1453] and there may be other answers in other contexts throughout the Scripture.
[time=1456] Here it says this, "Ultimately that he was asking them to live this type of life for their own good."
[time=1465] Look at verses two and three of Deuteronomy 6, it says this.
[time=1470] Actually, just one, this is the commandment and these are the statutes and the judgments that you may observe them in the land which you're crossing over,
[time=1476] that you may fear the Lord your God to keep his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, you and your son and your grandson, all the days of your life and that your days may be prolonged.
[time=1485] Therefore, hero Israel, be careful to observe that it may be well with you
[time=1492] and that you may multiply greatly as the Lord God of your fathers has promised you, a land flowing with milk and honey,
[time=1500] that it would go well with them.
[time=1502] Verses 10 and 11 says this in our same chapter, "So it shall be when the Lord your God brings you into the land which he swore to your fathers,
[time=1511] to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you large and beautiful cities which you did not build, house is full of gold things which you did not fill,
[time=1519] hewn out wells which you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant when you have eaten and are full."
[time=1526] You see God's purpose in bringing them into the land that he provided for them was to give them what they needed,
[time=1535] to provide for them, to care for them as their God.
[time=1540] It was for their good and then look at verse 18, it says this, "And you shall do what is right and good inside of the Lord, that it may be well with you."
[time=1550] See the repeat repetition here?
[time=1553] "That it may be well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land of which the Lord swore to your fathers."
[time=1559] And then to the end verse 24 it says this, "Then," actually verse 23, sorry, 23 and 24,
[time=1567] "Then he brought us out from here that he might bring us in to give us the land and the Lord commanded us to observe all these statues,
[time=1573] to fear the Lord our God for our good always."
[time=1579] So we can understand that God's prescription on our life, his commands and his statues are for our good,
[time=1586] not just some of the time, but every single time, his commands, his statutes, his judgments.
[time=1596] All of them were designed and they come from the heart of a heavenly Father who wants nothing but our good and his glory.
[time=1606] So the current context, but let's just widen it out a little bit to a closer context.
[time=1612] Go to Deuteronomy chapter 4, just two chapters earlier.
[time=1617] In verse 40 it says this, "You shall therefore keep his statutes and his commandments, which I command you today,
[time=1625] that it may go well with you and with your children after you and that you may prolong your days in the land which the Lord your God has given you."
[time=1634] The command is for your good and also for your children's good. Chapter 5 verse 29 says this.
[time=1643] It says, "Oh, that they had such a heart in them, God is speaking, that they would fear me and always keep all my commandments,
[time=1649] that it might be well with them and their children forever."
[time=1655] The specific context of Deuteronomy 6 is we back out to Deuteronomy 4 and Deuteronomy 5, but then we can even go more and say Psalm 32 would say this, and I've preached this message here before, but Psalm 32 10 says, "Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but he who trusts in the Lord, loving kindness shall surround him."
[time=1674] And what that saying is this, that when we choose to disobey God and not trust him in any given point of our day,
[time=1681] that's going to open us up to the consequences of departing from him, which is sin.
[time=1686] That leads to death, that leads to destruction, that leads to sorrow, it leads to everything that is negative.
[time=1693] And yet when we choose to obey God and stay inside of what he has for us, that's when God's loving kindness just surrounds us
[time=1702] as he protects us, as he cares for us.
[time=1705] Now that doesn't mean that we aren't going to suffer as Christians.
[time=1708] We understand that that's part of the Christian life, but even in the midst of that suffering, it's God's goodness, it's peace, it's joy, it's fulfillment, it's satisfaction.
[time=1718] It's his life given to us.
[time=1721] Back up even more to Ephesians 6, 1, as I think about children, children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.
[time=1728] Honor your father and mother, which is the first command with a promise, that what?
[time=1732] It may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.
[time=1739] And so as we understand what God is trying to tell his people is that, hey listen, my commands and my directions, my statutes, they're for your good.
[time=1752] So what does good mean?
[time=1754] We've already seen good means, God's care, right, in verses 10 and 11, the fact that he's going to provide for them,
[time=1760] these houses that they didn't build wells that are already dug for them, olive trees that are already planted for them.
[time=1766] So there's God's provision there.
[time=1769] And also I think it means God's peace and God's hope and God's joy and God's fulfillment was for their good.
[time=1779] So the question that I have then comes this, then why wouldn't they obey?
[time=1784] And if we understand that God's character is like that for us as well, then why wouldn't we obey?
[time=1793] And I think two things.
[time=1795] One, because it requires unconditional trust in God.
[time=1803] To trust him without any explanation.
[time=1806] To trust him unconditionally.
[time=1808] To trust him without our questions being answered sometimes.
[time=1814] It ultimately comes down to a matter of trust sometimes, doesn't it?
[time=1816] Do I really believe you, God?
[time=1818] Do you really have my best interest at heart?
[time=1824] And at the same time, while we're deciding whether we really want to trust God or not, what's also happening on a different level is that there are plenty other definitions of good coming in front of us.
[time=1838] The surrounding culture offered multiple different ways to live to the Israelites.
[time=1845] Different gods, different customs, different rituals, different ways to really track after happiness.
[time=1854] In their own way of doing things.
[time=1857] And so the people of Israel were there and they're listening to God, but they're seeing all these other cultures doing different things.
[time=1863] And in their mind thinking, "Okay, God, I'm listening to you, but I see this and it looks really good.
[time=1871] I'd like to partake in what they're doing."
[time=1877] Different gods and different customs.
[time=1880] And also their own longing for the past.
[time=1884] As they think about this current situation, I think this isn't good for me.
[time=1889] And then they start to think back to Exodus 16.
[time=1892] When God brought them out, and the whole congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness in Exodus 16-2.
[time=1901] And verse 3 says this, "The sons of Israel said to them, to Moses and Aaron,
[time=1907] would that we had died by the Lord's hand in the land of Egypt when we sat by pots of meat.
[time=1912] And when we ate bread to the full, for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger."
[time=1918] In other words, we had it good back then.
[time=1923] But now this isn't good for us.
[time=1925] Why did you bring us in this wilderness to die?
[time=1929] And at the very beginning of Deuteronomy in chapter 1, it says this, "When the spies came back, says you were not willing to go up into the land, but you rebelled Israel against the command of the Lord your God,
[time=1942] and you grumbled in your tents and you said, because the Lord hates us, he has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us."
[time=1952] You see, the people of Israel, they fought.
[time=1960] I really believe, they believed in their heart that they knew what was good for them.
[time=1968] As they just kind of viewed the circumstances, checking out what's going on, they weren't happy with what was going on, and they had their own definition of that as they think to their past.
[time=1980] They thought they knew what was good for them.
[time=1983] How could they possibly know better than the Creator God?
[time=1988] And yet in their heart of hearts, I believe they thought that.
[time=1992] Take us back to Egypt, 2 Samuel, give us a king so that we'll be like all the other nations.
[time=2002] Just like Eve in the garden, in Genesis 3, when the woman saw that the tree was good for food,
[time=2012] and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and she ate.
[time=2020] In other words, we could say this, when the woman saw that the tree was something that was really good for her,
[time=2028] however that played out, she thought it was good for her, didn't she?
[time=2036] And it wasn't, it was just a lie.
[time=2039] Just like everything else the world's trying to offer us, full of deception and lies.
[time=2046] Satan's not only a thief, as it says in Scripture, but he's also a murderer.
[time=2052] And his lies are trying to get us to believe a different definition of good.
[time=2060] And as we think about it today, we're no different, right?
[time=2064] I think I know what's good for me.
[time=2069] I really believe, God, I've got this one figured out, thanks.
[time=2073] Well you've prescribed for me in this area, I think I know what might be a little bit better.
[time=2078] I'm going to try it my own this way.
[time=2081] This marriage is too difficult, so I'm getting out, I'm giving up, I'll be better on my own, God.
[time=2086] Eating a ton of this food will make me feel much, much better.
[time=2092] I know this may stretch us financially and not be, not allow us to give, but this house, when we buy this house,
[time=2099] it'll bring our family together. I'm certain of it.
[time=2104] Forgive him, no way. That can't be good. I can't forgive him.
[time=2109] Be willing to be wronged? I don't think so. That doesn't sound good.
[time=2114] I need to stand up for my rights.
[time=2119] See, God called them to a specific way of life, and this life was for their good, but at the heart of this is a matter of trust.
[time=2128] Milton Vincent in a little book called the Gospel Primer said this.
[time=2132] He said every time I deliberately disobey a command of God, I am at that moment doubting God's true intentions for me and giving me that command.
[time=2141] Does he really have my good interest at heart?
[time=2145] Or is he withholding something that I'd be better off having?
[time=2150] It's a matter of trust.
[time=2155] And so that leads us to question number three.
[time=2161] How are we supposed or how was his people supposed to live that way?
[time=2166] How were they to live this and how could they trust him that his commands are good?
[time=2177] How were they to do it? And it comes in verses 20 and 25.
[time=2183] When you ask how are they to live this way and how could they trust, the answer comes back in this that they were to tell the story.
[time=2191] Basically that they were to live this way out of gratitude, motivated by grace, tell the story of the redemption.
[time=2201] We're not to live this way out of coercion, not out of fear, not to earn some type of merit with God, not simply because God said to.
[time=2209] Not because if I don't, God will get me.
[time=2213] But the answer to this is that we got to go back to tell the story.
[time=2219] Look at verse 20.
[time=2221] When your son asks you in time to come saying, what is the meaning of the testimonies, the statutes and the judgments which the Lord your God has commanded you?
[time=2231] Then you shall say to your son.
[time=2234] Now real quickly, notice what it doesn't say right away.
[time=2237] It doesn't say, son, because God said so.
[time=2243] That'd be legitimate though, right?
[time=2245] I mean he's the creator, he can do whatever he wants, obeyed because that's what God told us to do son.
[time=2251] So I'm going to answer your question about why commands with another command.
[time=2257] He goes there in verse 24.
[time=2259] He says, and the Lord commanded us to observe these things.
[time=2264] But oh, I'm still thankful that 20 and 21 and 22 and 23 are in there.
[time=2270] Because he basically says this, when your son comes to ask you, dad, I see you trying to live this life this way, but what's up with all the rules?
[time=2278] What's up with all the statutes?
[time=2280] I mean, why are we doing this?
[time=2284] And I might add that sometimes we need to talk and give an answer to our son, but sometimes we need to give that answer on our own heart sometimes, don't we?
[time=2293] But here's the answer.
[time=2295] Oh, son.
[time=2301] We were slaves.
[time=2304] We had no freedom.
[time=2307] We were back in Egypt under the mighty hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and God.
[time=2315] God came down, son.
[time=2318] And he rescued us, and he brought us out of Egypt into this good land.
[time=2326] And he did it with great signs and great wonders, as it says in verse 22.
[time=2331] And as you think about this, understand, they've got to tell the answer is this, not another command.
[time=2337] The answer is you've got to tell the story of the gospel.
[time=2342] And the most advanced version of the gospel to the date was the Exodus.
[time=2348] The signs and the wonders when the son is describing all that happened with the 10 plagues, and then he proceeds up to the 10th plague and the Passover.
[time=2359] And God said to Israel, on that day, I want you to kill a lamb.
[time=2365] And I want you to put the blood of that lamb on the doorposts.
[time=2369] And if you do that, the angel will pass by your house, and your firstborn will not die.
[time=2378] You notice you think about that.
[time=2381] The 10 plagues were judgment upon a sinful humanity.
[time=2387] And Israel was no different, right?
[time=2390] Israel was human just like the Egyptians.
[time=2393] So how did they get out of that?
[time=2395] Again, the judgment came on earth, and yet why didn't the Hebrew sons get killed?
[time=2401] Because they killed a lamb and spread the blood upon their doorposts.
[time=2406] In other words, they hid under the lamb.
[time=2414] And the father is to tell the story of the redemption of God from Egypt.
[time=2422] And yet, come to a point, can only go so far if the son asks, "But Dad, what's the blood of a lamb going to do?"
[time=2434] Right?
[time=2435] I'm sure at that point the dad would say, "Son, your guest is as good as mine, but God saved us that way."
[time=2443] And yet as we fast forward to John the Baptist, I think by revelation from God put it all together to say,
[time=2452] "Look, behold, see the one coming?
[time=2457] The lamb of God that would take away the sin of the world."
[time=2463] You see John the Baptist saying, "I get it.
[time=2465] The blood of that lamb was never to atone for sin, but it was to be a symbol of the one that's coming.
[time=2469] That would be the one lamb that would shed his blood that would cover sin forever."
[time=2477] You see, therefore, when we understand that it's the lamb's blood that covers us from God's judgment,
[time=2487] we can now trust him without question.
[time=2493] We can trust him without some of our answers to the questions that we have.
[time=2498] We can trust him unconditionally, and we can live a life that understands he is the creator, the one and only,
[time=2508] and that he's asked me to give all of his life.
[time=2510] And we do that because God has blessed us.
[time=2514] God has blessed us, son, therefore we obey.
[time=2519] Tim Keller said, "Before God ever asked Israel to write his commandments on their doorposts, which is Deuteronomy 6,
[time=2527] which is the 10 commandments, write these words on your doorpost.
[time=2531] Before God ever asked Israel to write his commandments on their doorpost, he first had them wipe blood on the doorpost."
[time=2541] That's really good.
[time=2543] Do you see the chronology there? Exodus 1 through 14 is where it's talking about all that God did to Egypt and the rescue,
[time=2551] and then the 10 commandments comes after that rescue.
[time=2558] God understands the order, God understands that we need help, and God understands that we need motivation.
[time=2563] That motivation comes from his redemption of us, and now that he has done that.
[time=2568] Now let's go in base. So here, when my daughters ask me,
[time=2575] Hollis and Jillian, when they say, "Dad, I see you trying to live the Christian life.
[time=2583] You take us to church, and you talk about the Lord, and you try to live all these ways,
[time=2589] and you've put kind of commands upon us and rules, and sometimes we don't like, "What's up with all the rules, Dad?" I can say, "Oh, Hollis, oh, Jillian, I was a slave to sin.
[time=2607] I was dead in my trespasses and sins, and yet God came out of eternity into human history
[time=2619] and lived a perfect life on this earth, was the spotless, pure Lamb of God that went to the cross
[time=2626] to take the punishment that I deserve, and because of that now, I am free from the penalty of sin,
[time=2634] from the power of sin, and one day I'm going to be with him away from even the presence of sin.
[time=2642] And now, Jillian, now, Hollis, even when I do sin, I can know that there's no condemnation for me.
[time=2648] Because I'm in Christ Jesus.
[time=2652] Oh, we need to tell the story.
[time=2656] We need to tell the gospel to our kids.
[time=2661] There is no greater message.
[time=2664] There is no greater story.
[time=2666] There is no greater truth than the gospel.
[time=2674] God has blessed us, therefore we obey, and God has done this for us, therefore we can trust him completely.
[time=2684] Romans 8.32 is perfect.
[time=2687] He who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all.
[time=2691] How will he not also freely give us all things in him?
[time=2696] We can understand if God saved us, he's going to continue that work and do everything he can for our good.
[time=2703] So we understand what God is calling us to, what he called his people to, to understand who he is truly, to love him completely.
[time=2720] We do that, they did that, for they're good, that it would go well with them.
[time=2727] And the motivation and the trust comes from the redemption story, the gospel story.
[time=2734] So here's the point.
[time=2739] The story has to be on your heart.
[time=2745] We are prone to forget, aren't we?
[time=2749] Look at verse 12 and what it says were no different.
[time=2753] Just after he said, "All of these things that I'm giving you and when you have eaten and you are full, then beware lest you forget the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt."
[time=2767] The gospel is not a one-time event in our lives.
[time=2771] It is to remain the central truth in our lives.
[time=2775] Galatians 614, Paul says it this way, "May it be that I would never boast except in Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[time=2782] First Corinthians 15-1, Paul says to the Corinthians church, "I delivered to you that which was of first importance, that Christ died for our sins."
[time=2793] The gospel is currently bearing fruit in your life right now.
[time=2797] Colossians 1 says this, "We give thanks to God because of the gospel which has come to you just as in all the world also.
[time=2805] This is constantly bearing fruit and increasing even as it has been doing in you since the day you heard of it."
[time=2813] The gospel is continuing to work in their life from justification on.
[time=2820] The gospel is what makes Christianity distinctive and at the same time is one of the best.
[time=2826] It's not the only but one of the best vehicles God has chosen to use to motivate our obedience so that it would go well with us.
[time=2834] So in application we need to have the gospel on our hearts and on our doorposts.
[time=2845] So how do we do that? Just some practical ways to think about this.
[time=2850] Number one, just when we have communion or when you have communion in your home maybe sometimes as you would do that as a family together,
[time=2860] make communion a time not only and not just to confess your sin but to remember and rejoice in your Savior and His atonement for that sin.
[time=2873] Make communion just a celebration of what He's done.
[time=2879] Memorize gospel verses.
[time=2882] 2 Timothy 1, 8, 9 is a fantastic verse.
[time=2887] Ephesians 2, 1 through 10 that talks about we were dead in our trespasses and sin but God because of His great love with which He loved us,
[time=2895] made us alive together with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly places for by grace you have been saved, it says.
[time=2902] Romans 8, 1, therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[time=2907] You want to keep the gospel on the frontals of your house and in your heart memorize those truths.
[time=2913] Be selective, strategic in the verses that you memorize. Titus 3, 4 through 6.
[time=2919] He says this but when the kindness of God and His love for mankind appeared, He saved us not on the basis of deeds which we have done but because of His grace and His mercy as He washed us.
[time=2930] Titus 3, 5 and 6.
[time=2934] These books about the gospel, I've mentioned this earlier, the gospel primer.
[time=2938] It's a wonderful little book that's going to help you preach the gospel to yourself on a daily basis.
[time=2943] The cross-centered life by C.J. Mahaney.
[time=2946] If you want to get a little bit thicker, the cross of Christ by John Stott or the atonement by Leon Morris.
[time=2953] All just wonderful works that help you dive into the depths of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2961] And as we do that and as we do our best to remember the redemption, we're just that much more prone.
[time=2971] It's that much easier to be able to tell the gospel story.
[time=2976] May that be something that we're known for.
[time=2980] People who tell the story of redemption.
[time=2984] Let's pray.
[time=2987] God, thank you again just so much.
[time=2992] I can't help but just get emotional about what you've done and may it never, may it never get routine please.
[time=3003] Would you please help us as a body of believers?
[time=3008] Would you help us to understand that the gospel needs to remain present on our hearts?
[time=3014] And if there's anyone here today who has never understood the gospel, never understood that their sin and their rebellion against you, God, and that you demand perfection.
[time=3028] Glory upon glory you sent your son to this earth who lived perfection and went to the cross to take the penalty for my sin.
[time=3043] For your sin, for the sins of the world.
[time=3049] For someone here today that hasn't known that or hasn't embraced that, I pray, oh Lord, helped him to understand the wonder and the glory of the gospel.
[time=3062] May it be our hearts theme.
[time=3064] Thank you so much that you have delivered us.
[time=3067] May we live a life that you've called us to that bring great glory and honor to you,
[time=3073] our great God and our King, the Creator, the only God.
[time=3079] We pray these things in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=3088] Church, would you stand please?
[time=3090] And we're going to sing a song together in conclusion this morning that helps us think about our amazing God who is worthy of our trust
[time=3100] and worthy of our obedience.
[time=3102] And to think about the Lamb who is slain, who has become our shield and our strength and our portion and our deliverer.
[time=3112] Sing this together.
[time=3114] I will bless the Lord forever.
[time=3124] Trust him at all times.
[time=3134] Sing of his deliverance.
[time=3137] He has delivered me from all fear.
[time=3147] He has set my feet upon a rock.
[time=3158] I will not be moved.
[time=3166] And I'll say of the Lord, you are my shield.
[time=3174] My strength.
[time=3178] My portion.
[time=3181] He'll deliver my shelter.
[time=3187] Strong tower.
[time=3190] My very presentel in time of need.
[time=3204] Sing of our God in heaven.
[time=3212] I am heaven but you.
[time=3217] It's desire him only.
[time=3220] There's no I desire to.
[time=3232] You have made me well.
[time=3238] And I'll say of the Lord, you are my shield.
[time=3246] My strength.
[time=3249] My portion.
