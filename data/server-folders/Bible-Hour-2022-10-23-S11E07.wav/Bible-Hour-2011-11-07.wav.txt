[time=718] Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=720] It's great to have you with us.
[time=721] My name is Kelly Bird and I'm the senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=725] And as always, week after week, we look forward to this time with you.
[time=730] I'm so thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=731] And I'm so excited about the message that you're going to hear today.
[time=735] It was a message that God did a lot of work on in my own heart in life as I prepared to teach it to our family this week.
[time=742] The things that I studied, the things that I read, the things found here in Deuteronomy chapter 7 are things that I think I needed personally.
[time=752] And I know as I've thought through it, I think most of you will find it extremely encouraging and challenging.
[time=758] It is about our devotion to God.
[time=761] And I want you to think about that just for a moment.
[time=763] Your devotion to God, or maybe just your devotion period.
[time=769] Because the fact is that you are, whoever you are, however old you are, however much life you've seen, whatever your background might be, whatever your ethnicity is, it doesn't matter.
[time=782] You are, as a human being, you will find yourself devoted to something.
[time=788] You are.
[time=789] You are devoted to something or someone.
[time=792] Something or someone has your allegiance.
[time=798] There is something or someone that keeps you up late, gets you up early, motivates you, drives you, kind of compels your desires.
[time=807] There is something or someone in your life that you are devoted to.
[time=813] And what we see in Deuteronomy 7 is this great opportunity for us to understand how important it is.
[time=819] How absolutely beneficial.
[time=821] The blessing that comes when we are devoted to God.
[time=825] And I want to just ask you today to think, as you listen, think about your life.
[time=830] Think about where you are today.
[time=832] Think about who or what you're devoted to and consider.
[time=835] How is it that maybe you could today move closer and closer to a true and genuine devotion to God?
[time=842] It's how your life will eventually work.
[time=845] It's how things come together when we live in a right relationship with God.
[time=850] And I hope today that you will be encouraged and challenged.
[time=854] And I can't wait to see what God's going to do with it.
[time=857] Thank you so much for tuning in.
[time=859] Thanks for being a part of the Black Hawk family.
[time=861] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=865] We bow our hearts and we bend our knees.
[time=871] O Spirit, come make us humble.
[time=876] And we turn our eyes from evil things.
[time=884] O Lord, we cast down our idols and give us clean hands.
[time=892] And give us pure hearts.
[time=896] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=902] And give us clean hands.
[time=905] And give us pure hearts.
[time=909] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=915] O God, let us be a generation that seeks, that seeks your face.
[time=924] O God and Jacob.
[time=928] O God, let us be a generation that seeks, that seeks your face.
[time=937] O God and Jacob.
[time=946] And we bow our hearts and we bend our knees.
[time=953] O Spirit, come make us humble.
[time=959] And we turn our eyes from evil things.
[time=965] O Lord, we cast down our idols and give us clean hands.
[time=973] And give us pure hearts.
[time=977] And let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=983] And give us clean hands.
[time=986] And give us pure hearts.
[time=989] And let us not lift our souls to another.
[time=995] O God, let us be a generation that seeks, that seeks your face.
[time=1002] O God and Jacob.
[time=1007] O God, let us be a generation that seeks, that seeks your face.
[time=1016] O God and Jacob.
[time=1034] Deuteronomy 7.
[time=1035] So here's the deal I was thinking about this this week.
[time=1037] And I started looking things up.
[time=1038] And I think I knew this, but I just had escaped my memory.
[time=1044] I've told you about Deuteronomy.
[time=1046] We've talked about the setting that we find ourselves in.
[time=1049] What we've got is we've got the people of Israel.
[time=1051] We've got the nation of Israel.
[time=1053] We've got the Jewish folks, God's chosen race.
[time=1056] And he wants to.
[time=1057] And he told their forefathers.
[time=1059] He wanted to give them a land.
[time=1061] He wanted to take them to a life and a land that would be theirs.
[time=1065] A life that they would live in relationship with their God.
[time=1069] And he had promised them this.
[time=1071] He had taken them.
[time=1073] He had rescued them out of Egypt.
[time=1075] He took them out of their slavery and out of their abuse and out of their mistreatment.
[time=1080] And out of all that was going on there, he rescues them from Pharaoh.
[time=1084] He marches them out in this exodus toward the promised land.
[time=1089] And they're on their way.
[time=1090] And then most of you in the room know that it got a little bit sideways.
[time=1093] They got sideways.
[time=1095] They started to complain.
[time=1096] They started in on their iniquity.
[time=1098] They started in on their unfaithfulness.
[time=1101] They didn't like the manna.
[time=1102] They didn't like this.
[time=1104] So God says, "Fine.
[time=1106] I'm going to literally just walk you in circles for how many years?" 40 years.
[time=1113] And in those 40 years, God tries to teach them.
[time=1120] And so now we come to the end of the 40 years and the people of Israel are on the plains of Moab.
[time=1127] They're right there on the bank of the Jordan River and they're getting ready to cross over the Jordan
[time=1134] into the promised life and promised land.
[time=1138] And I started thinking about it.
[time=1140] And I'm just going to share this with you.
[time=1142] I started thinking about it, about what that would look like.
[time=1145] Them walking over, them crossing over the Jordan.
[time=1148] And it got me thinking, "Do you know how many of them there were?"
[time=1156] Because I don't know that the flannel graph pictures in Sunday school do it justice.
[time=1163] But in my mind, I always kind of thought it was like just this big single file line.
[time=1168] In your mind's eye, what about you?
[time=1170] In your mind's eye, what do you see when you think about the people of Israel camped on the plains of Moab?
[time=1175] How many tents?
[time=1179] So I'm reading through and I come to Numbers and in Numbers 26 I think you'll see it there on the screen.
[time=1186] And Numbers 26 and the Bible counts people in a very unique way.
[time=1190] These are those who were numbered of the sons of Israel.
[time=1194] 601,730 and the way the Bible counts, that's adult males.
[time=1205] Somebody said, "Oh my gosh." That's what I said.
[time=1210] So if we just double that to account for adult females, now we go from 601 to 1,203, 460.
[time=1219] And if on top of that, let's just say we're spitball and we throw in kids newborn up to 18,
[time=1225] now we're easily pushing 2 million people.
[time=1232] Did you think that?
[time=1234] Did you know that?
[time=1237] Unbelievable.
[time=1240] And I just started thinking about it and I just wrote a couple of things down.
[time=1243] This is not meant to be profound.
[time=1245] This is just meant to get you thinking and I think it's good for us to understand the context.
[time=1249] First of all, this is somewhat profound.
[time=1251] Think about this.
[time=1252] There were that many people.
[time=1254] And now, is it any surprise to you that God wanted so desperately for them to be a holy people?
[time=1262] God wanted them to be a people set apart for him.
[time=1265] God wanted them to be a faithful and obedient.
[time=1268] He wanted them to obey and honor him to live and lead holy lives.
[time=1274] Because what would have happened with 2 million people living holy lives?
[time=1280] Wow.
[time=1281] What a picture.
[time=1283] I also started thinking because I'm in leadership and I lead a few people.
[time=1288] I don't lead 2 million.
[time=1290] Just imagine the leadership load that Moses and eventually Joshua carried.
[time=1296] Think about that.
[time=1297] Think about the responsibility.
[time=1299] Oh, it was clear through the Scriptures that God made provision.
[time=1303] He brought along those who would help.
[time=1306] But make no mistake, God also made it clear Moses, these are your people.
[time=1311] And I am looking to you to lead them.
[time=1314] Joshua was given charge over them as they cross over into the promised land.
[time=1319] What an amazing challenge that must have been.
[time=1323] Imagine the opinions that were out there.
[time=1326] Imagine the issues that they faced.
[time=1329] Imagine all the situations that they encountered.
[time=1335] And this was funny to me.
[time=1336] It doesn't have to be funny to you.
[time=1337] I just laughed in my office when I thought about it, so I put it down for three.
[time=1340] Imagine 2 million people crossing the river.
[time=1342] How long does this take?
[time=1345] I always thought crossing over the river was like at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
[time=1350] I imagine it took weeks.
[time=1351] I don't know how long it took.
[time=1353] How does it take to get 2 million people over a river?
[time=1356] Unbelievable when you think of the scope of what God is doing as he moves these people into this land.
[time=1361] Now watch this.
[time=1362] And this is fun.
[time=1363] I love it when it works out this way.
[time=1365] Today, all we're going to do is this.
[time=1367] We're going to read the Scripture.
[time=1369] And as I take you through Deuteronomy 7, we're going to just read these chunks.
[time=1373] And as we read through these chunks of Scripture in Deuteronomy 7, what you're going to see,
[time=1380] and what we're going to focus on today, principles, truths are going to start just popping off
[time=1387] the page.
[time=1388] And we're going to begin to have this picture painted for us of what it means and what it looks like, my friends, to live lives that are devoted to God.
[time=1400] God wanted God longed for the devotion of His people.
[time=1405] What is devotion?
[time=1407] You know what devotion is?
[time=1408] It's saying about it.
[time=1410] It's who or what you lift your soul up to.
[time=1414] It's where your allegiance lies.
[time=1416] It's where your affection lies.
[time=1418] It's what you are committed to.
[time=1421] It's that thing.
[time=1422] It's that person that when it's all said and done, you're with Him, or you're with her, or you're with it.
[time=1428] We are devoted.
[time=1429] We are committed.
[time=1431] And God longed for that devotion from His people, from you, from day one.
[time=1438] Now listen, we're going to read seven.
[time=1441] As we go through, you're going to see this picture painted of what it means to live a life of devotion.
[time=1446] Now before we start, just admit this.
[time=1448] Just know that this is true.
[time=1450] You, whoever you are, no matter how old you are, no matter how much life you've seen, no matter how long you've been around here, you are devoted to something.
[time=1461] Every one of us, we are devoted.
[time=1466] It's the way we're wired.
[time=1468] You worship.
[time=1470] You have allegiance toward.
[time=1472] You have affection for.
[time=1474] You are committed to something or someone.
[time=1481] Let's just hope.
[time=1484] It's Him.
[time=1486] Let's just hope.
[time=1487] It is the one and true God who loved you so much He gave His Son so you could have forgiveness
[time=1494] of sin and a life today and forever with Him.
[time=1499] See the God of the Bible, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob longs for your devotion to
[time=1505] Him.
[time=1506] And as we read through this, you're going to see what that can look like.
[time=1509] You may find yourself, many did first hour.
[time=1514] You may find yourself needing to make a devotion realignment.
[time=1520] You may be in need of an adjustment, if you will, on the devotion front.
[time=1525] Let the Word of God help you figure that out this morning, a life of devotion to God.
[time=1532] We're going to start in chapter 7, verses 1 to 6.
[time=1535] And I'm going to read this to you and then I'm going to give you the first point.
[time=1539] When the Lord your God, Moses here speaking to the people.
[time=1542] When the Lord your God brings you into the land where you are entering to possess it and clears away many nations.
[time=1549] Look what God did.
[time=1550] Clears away many nations before you.
[time=1552] The Hittites and the Gergeschites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Parazites and the Hivites
[time=1560] and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and stronger than you stop right there.
[time=1567] Side note here, not having really to do with devotion, but just think about that for a second.
[time=1572] Seven nations larger than them.
[time=1576] So 14 million plus at the least moved aside, cleared out by God as he makes room in this land
[time=1591] for his people to come and live this life and this relationship with him.
[time=1596] Quite a picture of how God prepares away seven nations greater and stronger than you.
[time=1601] And here you go, and when the Lord your God delivers them before you and you defeat them,
[time=1608] then you shall utterly destroy them.
[time=1611] You shall make no covenant with them and show no favor to them.
[time=1616] Furthermore, you shall not intermarry with them.
[time=1619] You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor shall you take their daughters for your sons, for they will turn your sons away from following me to serve other gods.
[time=1631] Then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you and he will quickly destroy you.
[time=1638] But thus you shall do to them.
[time=1640] You shall tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars and hue down their ashram
[time=1647] and burn their graven images with fire, for you are a holy people to the Lord your God.
[time=1653] The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.
[time=1663] Now I don't know what popped off the page at you as we read through those six verses,
[time=1670] but here's what popped off the page to me.
[time=1673] Principle number one, write it down.
[time=1675] A life of devotion to God, are you interested in that?
[time=1678] I hope so.
[time=1679] A life of devotion to God aggressively removes any opportunity for what?
[time=1687] Say it, church.
[time=1689] Compromise.
[time=1690] And next to aggressively, you know what?
[time=1692] You could write down ruthlessly.
[time=1694] You could write down radically.
[time=1696] I mean, you can pick your word, but the point is here as you read through verses one to six,
[time=1702] God sets it really clear.
[time=1704] There is to be an aggressive removal of any opportunity at all for compromise.
[time=1709] Compromise that would move his people away from devotion to him and him alone.
[time=1717] And why is it such a big deal?
[time=1719] It's a big deal because listen, you know it's true.
[time=1722] I know it's true.
[time=1723] We've lived it.
[time=1724] We've seen it.
[time=1725] Compromise nullifies commitment.
[time=1729] Every time, compromise squeezes out our devotion, pushing it aside.
[time=1736] Compromise weakens commitment.
[time=1738] That which is strong, that which is stable, that which is set in the right direction, gets
[time=1744] undercut, gets weakened, gets tempered, gets diminished when compromise takes place.
[time=1751] And according to these verses, there are three compromises.
[time=1755] I want you to look at this morning.
[time=1756] Three things you never, never do with those.
[time=1761] Here, this is very important.
[time=1763] You hear this.
[time=1764] Three things you never do with those who are not devoted to God.
[time=1772] With those who don't love him, because if you don't love him, the scripture has taught us recently, you what?
[time=1778] You hate him.
[time=1779] Those who are not devoted to him.
[time=1782] Those who don't share in that commitment toward devotion for him.
[time=1787] Those who don't represent the kind of living and the kind of thinking and the kind of valuing
[time=1793] that shows them to be children of God.
[time=1796] And this isn't a, "I'm better than you" thing.
[time=1798] This isn't good people, bad people.
[time=1800] It's talking about what is the leaning, what is the condition of their heart.
[time=1805] And when we're talking about people who they were talking about, all these isites and parasites and gerizites and all these folks, they didn't like God.
[time=1815] They hated God.
[time=1816] They didn't live for God.
[time=1817] They didn't have commitment to God.
[time=1819] They thought God was a joke.
[time=1822] They had their own gods.
[time=1824] Filled with immorality and ashara poles and women and prostitution and baby sacrifice.
[time=1831] And it was awful.
[time=1834] And he says, "Don't go near that." Don't compromise because if you do, there will be a price and he gives us three ways
[time=1845] in which we should stay apart.
[time=1848] You do not, number one, you do not partner with them contractually.
[time=1853] You do not, look at, look at verse two.
[time=1856] You do not partner with them contractually.
[time=1858] Then you shall utterly destroy them.
[time=1861] You shall, there it is, you shall make no covenant with them.
[time=1866] We're not going to make any deals.
[time=1869] We're not going to go in on something.
[time=1871] I'm not going to take my family.
[time=1873] I'm not going to take my earnings.
[time=1874] I'm not going to take my valley.
[time=1876] I'm not going to take it and combine it with someone who doesn't love God, who's not devoted to God.
[time=1881] Doesn't mean I'm perfect in my devotion to God.
[time=1884] I'm just saying God wants me to be very careful not to attach myself contractually.
[time=1890] And in the process, put so much at stake with those whose heart isn't bent in a direction toward devotion.
[time=1899] You do not partner with them contractually.
[time=1905] Look what it says.
[time=1908] Look what it says in verse three.
[time=1911] It says in verse three, "Furthermore you shall not intermarry with them.
[time=1915] You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor shall you take their daughters for your sons."
[time=1925] Here you go.
[time=1926] I just wrote this down.
[time=1927] You do not marry them.
[time=1928] And then in parenthesis is the Kelly Bird version.
[time=1932] So why in the world would you date them?
[time=1936] And I'm sort of being humorous, but I'm sort of not.
[time=1941] And I want to, why would you date them?
[time=1944] See, I want, I want to just make sure that everybody in the room stays with me here because why would you date them?
[time=1949] Maybe you think I just went to talking to young people.
[time=1954] But I want to remind you parents, and it's what it says, and I believe there's some truth here for us to consider.
[time=1961] And let me say this up front.
[time=1962] This gets a little dicey.
[time=1964] Okay, let me just say this up front.
[time=1966] This can get a little bit tricky, but I'm going to say it.
[time=1969] I'm going to throw it out there, and I want us to have integrity and honesty as we wrestle with this.
[time=1976] It says, "Furthermore, you shall not intermarry with them.
[time=1980] You shall not give your daughters to their sons.
[time=1987] You implied clearly adults.
[time=1991] You shall not give your daughters to their sons.
[time=1997] You shall not give their daughters to your sons."
[time=2003] If I might be missing something, but it seems as if there's still some parental responsibility here.
[time=2011] Anybody?
[time=2013] Parental responsibility that we run from at times because it's so messy and so scary and can get so dicey
[time=2021] and all of a sudden kids don't like us and all of a sudden we come off like we're this or we come off like we're that.
[time=2026] Now listen, part of that's because we start getting involved in this discussion at the age of 0-16.
[time=2033] Instead of getting involved in this discussion when they're 4, and 5, and 6, little ones who can understand not mom and dad's desire to control,
[time=2046] but God's desire for them to understand how utterly important it is that the young lady,
[time=2056] young men, that the young lady who you would be with and share your life with would be a woman who would have nothing but support and care and excitement for God's call on your life.
[time=2070] Nothing but support and care and encouragement for who God's called you to be as a man.
[time=2076] I want my daughters someday to be able to be with a man who they love and respect and who they can absolutely with everything God has given them.
[time=2086] While they are engaged in their own calling for their lives they can support and care for and come alongside God's call on a young man's life.
[time=2097] I want nothing more than for my sons, and I know you want nothing more for yours than to be able to care for, shepherd, put their arms around and spiritually provide spiritually shepherd the woman that they would marry.
[time=2112] This is how God designed it. This isn't pie in the sky. This isn't me just making a wish list. This is what God designed.
[time=2119] And so He says to them, "For the first time ever they move into the neighborhood."
[time=2125] He says, "Absolutely, absolutely not, because I want your hearts and I want your devotion and I want your commitment to be toward me.
[time=2136] And here's the deal. When you go and you romantically, personally, emotionally get close to, when you start to cozy up to someone who may be a great gal or who may be a great guy,
[time=2148] but their heart isn't at its deepest part bent toward Him, you are going to begin to have your heart bent toward wherever their heart is.
[time=2158] That's just how it works. Undivoted moves devotion away from center. It always happens.
[time=2172] And so God says to parents, and God says to kids, "You do not marry them."
[time=2180] And this is a biggie. This isn't a gray area. This is really, really important.
[time=2187] You don't partner with them contractually. You don't marry them. So why would you date them?
[time=2193] You don't ever allow yourself number three. You don't ever allow yourself to get cozy, close, or intimate with their idols or gods.
[time=2201] You heard it. You read it. You saw the language. You will tear down their altars.
[time=2208] You will smash their sacred pillars. You will hue down their ashram and burn their graven images with fire.
[time=2216] Look, there aren't a lot of ashram poles around these days, literal ashram poles.
[time=2224] There aren't a ton of graven images. Most of those in your life and most of them in my life who don't love God, who think God's a joke, who have committed themselves to everything and anything other than God.
[time=2239] I have to be careful with because while I love many of them and want desperately to see them as we continue to live life together at a certain level,
[time=2250] I want to see them come to understand what it means to really know him and serve him and love him.
[time=2256] I have to be careful because they're devoted to their gods and I can get cozy. I can get close. I can get intimate.
[time=2266] Like that, it can happen. I can begin to come over here and find this very attractive. I can begin to drift over here and find that very interesting.
[time=2274] There are things that, if we're not careful, can move us away from devotion to our capital G, God of God's, God of the Bible, God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who loves you.
[time=2288] And so you've got to be cautious and wise in how you deal with, how far you go, what you open your heart and your mind to.
[time=2298] A life of devotion to God means aggressively removing any and every opportunity for compromise.
[time=2305] Secondly, and this is a repeat, but we're going to just repeat it and try to move on, but it's worth, I think, looking at again, a life of devotion to God never, ever forgets God's faithfulness.
[time=2316] And in response to his faithfulness that you never, ever forget a life of devotion to God obeys faithfully.
[time=2326] Faithfully, look at verses 7 through 11. The Lord did not set his love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of the peoples, for you were the fewest of all the peoples.
[time=2340] But because the Lord loved you and kept the oath which he swore to your forefathers, the Lord brought you out by a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery from the hand of Pharaoh, King of Egypt.
[time=2353] Now, therefore, now, therefore that the Lord your God know that the Lord your God, he is God, the faithful God who keeps his covenant and his loving kindness to the thousandth generation with those who love him and keep his commandments.
[time=2369] But repays those who hate him, there it is, to their faces, to destroy them. He will not delay with him who hates him. He will repay him to his face.
[time=2379] Therefore, you shall keep the commandment and the statutes and the judgments which I am commanding you today to do them.
[time=2392] Look back there at 8, but because the Lord loved you and kept the oath, he redeemed you from the house of slavery, brought you out from Pharaoh's beatings and mistreatment.
[time=2406] Someone might read that and say, "Okay, Kelly, I see what you're doing here. You're saying this. You're saying, "So what God's about is, don't forget all I did for you."
[time=2414] In other words, obey me then out of obligation. Maybe this is how that reads to you.
[time=2422] Is obedience to God just you did this for me, God, so I'll do this for you, I guess? Is that how it works?
[time=2432] Is that what God designed? No. No, no, not at all. He did do all those things, but he's hoping it doesn't birth obligation.
[time=2443] He hopes that it births. Well, look for yourself. Look at verse 9.
[time=2450] He hopes that it births what? No, therefore, that the Lord, your God, he is God, the faithful God who keeps his covenant and his loving kindness to a thousandth generation with those who what?
[time=2461] I can't say it, Church. Love him. Love him and keep his commandments.
[time=2473] So interesting. To talk with your kids, I'll talk to mine at times. It's so interesting when we'll be sitting talking somewhere, driving usually, but we might be at the house and it just might be kind of a down moment.
[time=2486] I ask him, you know, come on, be serious. Why do you love me? Why do you love me? And it's so cool. Yes, it feels like a, you know, a manipulated pat on the back, but beyond that, to hear them each and every time from the youngest of ages to the oldest, they go back again and again.
[time=2509] Well, you did this. And you did that. And you do this. And you do that.
[time=2518] And they begin to recall everything I've done, everything I've offered, everything I've sacrificed, everything they begin to look back on my interaction with them and my love for them and my faithfulness to them and me rescuing them from whatever or whoever.
[time=2535] These acts of kindness and devotion, they remember them and it produces in them not some benign, detached, oh, well, I guess I'll do what you want then.
[time=2548] What it produces in them is love. And the Bible teaches us that with love, with real genuine love comes obedience. God's never been.
[time=2558] He has never been, ever from the beginning interested in ritual. God has never been about emotionally detached obligatory compliance.
[time=2575] He has always wanted a people who would recognize his unbelievable love toward them and love him back with Joss Rang, Deuteronomy 6, all of their heart, all of their souls, all of their might.
[time=2588] That's what God wanted. First, John 5, 3, you'll see it on the screen for this is the love of God that we keep his what? Say it. His commandments. And his commandments, when we come at it from a heart of love, his commandments are not burdensome, not obligatory.
[time=2605] Look at 2 John 6, says there in 2 John 6, it says, and this is love that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment just as you have heard it from the beginning that you should walk in it from the beginning.
[time=2622] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, from the beginning, God said, "Would you please love me? Love me, and from a heart of love, you will follow me. You will obey me." Jesus said it so clearly in John 14, 15, "If you love me, you will keep my what?" Church said, "My commandments, if you love me."
[time=2647] Hey, listen, I got to tell myself this, I got to tell you if I'm going to tell me, if you're not obeying God, you're not loving him.
[time=2657] The one who says he loves him but doesn't obey him, and I'm not talking perfection here, I'm talking as a pattern.
[time=2668] The one who says I love him, the one who says, "Oh God, I love you," but doesn't as a pattern obey him in all areas of life, doesn't, does not love him.
[time=2681] The Scriptures say, "Do not be deceived, you are not loving God, you don't love him. If as a pattern your life continues to move in directions of disobedience, loving God, an affection for God, a longing for God, a desire to be with and close to him, loving God brings obedience."
[time=2702] I want you to write these four things down real quick, and we're going to move forward here. You cannot truly love God, you're ready? You cannot truly love God, so if you want to truly love God, make sure you understand these four things.
[time=2715] You can't truly love God part-time. I'm going to just say this to you. You cannot love him, and if you don't love him, you're not going to obey him, and if you don't obey him, it'll all get sideways quick.
[time=2728] So we're back to loving him, and you can't love him part-time. Hey, listen, if this somehow has become for you once or twice every month thing, it's not going to work.
[time=2742] If this is three times a week, throw up a prayer to the big guy type thing, it's not going to work. It will not go well. Well, I can say this, if that's you, I can say this, it's not going well, is it?
[time=2759] No, loving God is a daily deal. Loving God is a regular gig. Loving God is every single day, you and me, when those feet hit the carpet or hardwood or linoleum or whatever.
[time=2773] Devoting ourselves, completely surrendering ourselves, completely willing to follow him, wherever he leads, it's pursuing a relationship with him on a constant regular basis through the word, through prayer, through fellowship, through service, through friendship, through community.
[time=2793] No, no, no, this is not a part-time deal. This is every minute of every day, hour by hour, week after week, and I don't mean to paint a picture there of heavy burdensome labor. No, it's cool, it's good, it's right.
[time=2810] It's not part-time. Loving God is not part-time. Loving God is not possible. You can't truly love God with unconfessed sin. I'm going to just say that to you.
[time=2820] Hour by hour, day by day, week by week, if there's something in the way, there's something that hasn't been made right. If there's something that's blocking your fellowship and your relationship with him, and the one thing that does is sin.
[time=2833] And if you don't make it right, if you're not on your knees, if I'm not honestly coming before him and I'm not just talking about it at night before my head hits the pillow, I'm trying to develop a life of confessional living.
[time=2845] I don't know about you, but I sin a lot. Can I say that? I sin a lot. I sin often. And if sin gets in the way of me and God, then I better be doing what often? Confessing my sin often.
[time=2865] I'm trying to get better at this. I'm realizing how much of my life I've spent blocked from what he probably wanted to do or reveal.
[time=2875] So you can't truly love God and you can't then obey God and then you can't experience all that God has for you if the loving God gets blocked because there's sin so confess it.
[time=2885] You can't truly love God on your own. Write that down. You cannot truly love God on your own. My friends, God did not design this to be some autonomous endeavor that you and you alone are on.
[time=2900] No God designed this relationship with God, the life that God has promised us, what he wants us to look like as his people who are living in relationship with him, he designed that for you to live with me and for me to live it with you.
[time=2917] He designed us to live it together, together in worship, together in small groups, in a living room on Tuesday night, together with four guys in a restaurant booth on Saturday morning, together down the hall on an ABF on Sunday morning, together in a grow group on Thursday night.
[time=2932] We're trying our best to give you every opportunity possible to come at loving God and the life that he's called you to in the way that he designed it to be lived and he didn't design it to be lived alone.
[time=2946] You have got to be connected in a meaningful, intimate way that promotes honesty and accountability and growth.
[time=2954] Number four, you can't truly love God with him in second or third place. You can't do it.
[time=2962] Remember this whole study this morning is about devotion. Remember I told you, you are devoted to something. You are devoted to someone. I am telling you, if there is someone or something above him in the rankings, it's not going to work.
[time=2980] He didn't design this thing to work with him at three.
[time=2985] And we've already had the discussion about does that make him egotistical? No, it doesn't. It makes him loving because the only way it works for you is when he's at one.
[time=2996] So you have got to and I have got to be so very careful with these things if we're going to truly be able to love him and from that love, obey him.
[time=3007] And with that obedience, experience the life that he's designed us to live. Here you go, one thing to take out the door.
[time=3015] And I want to be practical as we talk about these things. So here comes some practicality. And I'm talking to every person in the room.
[time=3022] What's one thing that God has been asking you to do lately that you haven't done?
[time=3028] What is one thing in your marriage? What is one thing in your private life? What is one thing financially? What is one thing at work? What is one thing? I'm just asking for one.
[time=3039] One thing that he has been nudging you toward, he wants you to obey him on this. And I am just saying to you this morning, let's all of us just identify that one thing and out of love for him because we do remember what he brought us out of.
[time=3055] We do remember his mighty works and it has created in us. Not an obligatory, detached, benign, I guess I'll just do it. No, I know many of you love him.
[time=3067] You love him deeply for who he is and what he's done. So out of that love, let's obey him and let's you, kids, moms and dads, obey him this week.
[time=3079] So pick one thing, write it down, make a mental note, but I want to encourage you this morning to show your devotion to God by obeying him, do what he's asking you to do, or stop doing what he's been asking you to stop.
[time=3096] And do it because you love him, because of the gratitude and affection you have for God in light of all he has done. Jesus said if you love me, you will keep my commandments.
[time=3108] If you go the third point, you can just write this down, a life of devotion to God faces and conquers fear with faith. It faces and conquers fear with faith.
[time=3120] Just look at 7-17 real quick. If you should say in your heart, these nations, God, these nations are greater than we are.
[time=3131] These nations are greater than I. How can I dispossess them? You shall not be afraid of them. You shall well remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all of Egypt.
[time=3145] So he goes on in that passage and he just says, kind of the same thing again. Listen, remember who I am. Remember who you're dealing with here. This is me.
[time=3154] This is the God of God's. And I have been faithful to you and your faith in me can allow you to stand. Can you imagine them getting ready to cross over this river?
[time=3167] And there are 14 million plus who hate them and they hate their God and they're bigger and they're nastier and they're meaner.
[time=3179] And I get it. I get them saying, well, what are you doing? I can't do this. And what's your this? What's yours? It's a cancer.
[time=3193] Some of you are facing disease. Some of you are facing unemployment. Some of you are facing family dynamics and issues.
[time=3204] You are just at your wits and you don't know what to do. Some of you are lonely. Some of you have been hurt. Some of you have been abused.
[time=3217] I don't know what everyone's facing. They faced an enemy that was huge. So do you.
[time=3228] And he says, in the face of that, do not forget my love for you. And do not forget what I have accomplished.
[time=3238] The great trials, 19, we're going to end with this. Just listen. This is great. It's great drama. It's great. It's just great text.
[time=3247] It's great trials which your eyes saw. Just picture this. And the signs and wonders, the Nile turning bloody and the locust filling the air.
[time=3258] Remember, they saw all of what God had done in Egypt. The wonders in the mighty hand and the outstretched arm by which the Lord your God brought you out.
[time=3268] So shall the Lord your God do to all the peoples, all the trials, all the cancer, all the unemployment, all the people who are difficult,
[time=3276] all the heartache in your life. So shall the Lord your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
[time=3283] Moreover, the Lord your God will sin. I love this. Where this came from, I don't know, but it's in the Bible and I just think it's cool.
[time=3289] Moreover, the Lord your God will sin the hornet against them until those who are left and hide themselves from you perish.
[time=3297] He literally destroyed people with hornets. You shall not dread them. For the Lord your God is in your midst, a great and awesome God.
[time=3308] The Lord, now listen to this. The Lord your God will clear away these nations before you. What does it say?
[time=3316] Little by little. See, a lot of us don't like that when we're facing our giant, right?
[time=3323] We want it fixed. Boom. And he says, you know what? I am going to deliver you, but I am going to deliver you little by little.
[time=3333] Be faithful. Your faith can conquer your fear in whatever you are facing.
[time=3342] The Lord your God, 23, will deliver them before you and will throw them into great confusion until they are destroyed.
[time=3350] He will. He will deliver their kings. Oh my goodness. He will deliver their kings into your hand so that you will make their name perish from under heaven.
[time=3361] No man will be able to stand before you until you have destroyed them.
[time=3367] Here's three things for you. Remember him. Resolve to obey him. Repeat process as many times as necessary.
[time=3376] Remember him. Resolve to obey him. Repeat process as many times as necessary. He is faithful. Amen?
[time=3387] Let's stand and pray as we leave. Father in heaven, we are grateful for what we've seen here in Deuteronomy.
[time=3394] So thankful, God, for the story of you and your people as we find ourselves in this unbelievable spot today of being your people.
[time=3405] God, having the privilege of living in relationship with you, we are grateful for what you taught them.
[time=3411] Thankful for these words that you gave them as they entered into the land. Oh God, we enter into the land today.
[time=3418] We walk through these doors and we head into a land that is filled with those who are devoted to other gods who believe other things,
[time=3431] whose allegiances and whose affections are elsewhere.
[time=3435] And God, you've called us to live in the midst of all of that as your holy set-apart devoted people.
[time=3442] And O God, I pray that today we would write these things down not just on paper, but in our hearts.
[time=3449] May we remove anything that would lead us to compromise.
[time=3454] God, may we remember your faithfulness and may that prompt loving obedience.
[time=3460] And may we face our fears, may we face those giants, may we face those other nations, if you will, and may our faith overcome our fear.
[time=3473] And may we resolve to follow you.
[time=3476] Father, give us help in these endeavors.
[time=3480] Give us great strength to accomplish them and bring us back together again, if that be your will.
[time=3486] And all the people agreed and said, amen.
