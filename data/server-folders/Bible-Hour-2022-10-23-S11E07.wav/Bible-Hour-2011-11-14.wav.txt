[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] [MUSIC - 26 seconds]
[time=62] - Well, hello everybody, welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=70] It's great to have you with us, and it is great to have my good friend, Rod Ovid, with us again as well.
[time=75] You may be getting used to Rod.
[time=77] Rod is certainly a part of my own personal life.
[time=80] He's been a great friend and encouragement to me over the years.
[time=83] He is a part of our ministry team here at Black Hawk, and Rod and his wife, Carolyn, are the founders of Logos Institute of Biblical Studies.
[time=92] - That's right.
[time=93] - And Logos is something that is allowing everyday people, just like you and me, to experience an in-depth, biblical, doctrinal training that I am so excited about.
[time=104] And we've told you about Logos in the past, but Rod, it's a new semester, and I know there are new classes, I know there are new opportunities, some new locations, and so give the folks just a brief update on some of the things that you've got cooking.
[time=120] - All right.
[time=121] - And I might interrupt you as we go.
[time=122] - No problem, no problem.
[time=123] - Ready to go.
[time=124] - I'll give you a brief update.
[time=125] Things have been happening, Kelly, as I keep you abreast of, we've had growth, we have new people, we have some new teachers, we have new locations, we have a new bookstore, so let me just go through it.
[time=138] First off, people can find us on the web quite easily.
[time=141] It's www.logosbiblical.org.
[time=146] You can go to the website here at Blackhawk and link right to us as well.
[time=151] - Logosbiblical.org.
[time=153] - Or get it through the Blackhawk website.
[time=157] Once you're there, you're gonna see some new stuff, it's gonna talk about a new location.
[time=162] Let me just go through the week.
[time=163] On Monday nights, we're still up in Auburn, we're at Lakewood, on Tuesdays, we're over at Chapel, on Wednesdays, we're here at Blackhawk every Wednesday, and on Thursdays, we're moving to Brookside, real excited about it, Jim Pearson's really behind this, and we're real excited about that crowd.
[time=182] Saturdays, we're down town at Greater Progressive.
[time=186] Times on a weekdays are six and 732 programs a night, and on the weekend, it's nine and 1030.
[time=195] New semester, as you said, Kelly, so we have some new classes, at a Blackhawk, at six to 730, we'll be starting the theology.
[time=204] Doctrine, awesome class, new teacher.
[time=207] We have Dr. Glach doing it, as well as an Eric Tennis from Biola, fabulous guy, very excitable, very knowledgeable, very excited about mixing up a little West Coast in there, goes well, and then we have Dr. Bailey, President of Dallas, Theological Seminary, joins us a little bit in the New Testament studies.
[time=232] Just a lot of good stuff happening, and so it's a new semester starting the week of October 31st here at Blackhawk, so if you haven't come, try it out.
[time=245] Even if you miss that first week, join us any time, you jump right in, and what we're doing, we're inviting Kelly, people that just come try it out.
[time=253] They don't have to worry about the pay, or anything, or signups, or a commitment.
[time=258] Sit in the back, sit in the front, sit anywhere.
[time=260] If you like it, sign up at the end.
[time=262] - Quick question for you, right?
[time=263] You're saying the new semester begins the 31st, and people may know this, they may not, but the cost for this is pretty exciting.
[time=273] Just real briefly what the cost really is.
[time=275] - Yeah, we're running $5 a night.
[time=277] - $5 a night, wow. - $5 a night.
[time=278] - That's right, so we try to get people to pay for we do a semester of 10 weeks.
[time=282] We go five weeks on, a week off for a break, and five weeks on.
[time=286] We follow the curriculum or that calendar of the Fort Wayne Public Schools, so if your kid isn't going to school, it won't be going to Lagos that week.
[time=295] So it's 50 bucks for 10, five bucks a night per class.
[time=299] - Awesome, well we believe deep in our hearts, Rod and I, and everybody involved with Lagos, that the scriptures, that the great truth of God's word, that the real meat of doctrine and the way it applies to everyday life is something everybody should have a chance to understand and know better.
[time=316] So I hope you'll come.
[time=317] I know everything Rod just said is on the website.
[time=319] - Yes, everything.
[time=320] - And if you just go to the website, it's right here on the bottom of our screen.
[time=324] Go to the website, dig around, write down some questions, contact Rod and Carolyn, it is something that you will not regret, a great opportunity, and praise God for a new Spanish class that our good friend Jesus Escabato is leading.
[time=340] I'm so thankful.
[time=341] - Oh that's so exciting where we have a lot of people there.
[time=344] Two locations, that's on the website as well.
[time=346] - Yeah, well thank you Rod, thanks for being with us.
[time=348] Thank you everybody for tuning in.
[time=350] And I hope today's message is an encouragement to you.
[time=353] I hope what you hear and sense from the word of God.
[time=356] I hope you'll allow it to change and transform your life.
[time=359] God bless you and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=363] In 1897, Rudyard Kipling, a well-known poet and author, wrote The Jungle Book and Gunga Den and other things.
[time=374] He wrote a poem called "Recessional" and it wasn't the first thing that he wrote.
[time=379] He wrote it for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, her 60th anniversary of her reign.
[time=385] And he had one thing he wrote that he was gonna read first, then he went another way and he read this, I think a much more, dare I say, confrontational thing.
[time=397] We're gonna read this together.
[time=401] I'm gonna read these stanzas.
[time=403] And at the end of each verse, there is that two phrase line lest we forget, lest we forget.
[time=412] I would invite you to say that those two phrases with me, each verse, lest we forget, lest we forget.
[time=419] As we read through this poem, we'll be in Deuteronomy chapter eight this morning and this seemed a very fitting introduction.
[time=428] God of our fathers, known of old,
[time=434] Lord of our far-flung battle line, beneath whose awful hand we hold dominion over palm and pine, Lord God of hosts be with us yet,
[time=447] lest we forget, lest we forget.
[time=451] The tumult, the noise and the shouting dies, the captains and the kings depart, still stands your ancient sacrifice, a humble and contrite heart.
[time=463] Lord God of hosts be with us yet, lest we forget, lest we forget.
[time=469] Far called our navies melt away, on dune and headland sinks the fire, low all our pomp of yesterday, is one with Nineveh, entire.
[time=482] Judge of the nations, spare us yet, lest we forget, lest we forget.
[time=489] If drunk with sight of power, we loose wild tongues that do not have you in awe, such boastings that the Gentiles use or lesser breeds without the law, Lord God of hosts be with us yet, lest we forget, lest we forget.
[time=509] For heathen heart that puts her trust in reeking tube and iron shard, all valiant dust that builds on dust and guarding does not call you to guard.
[time=525] For frantic boast and foolish word, thy mercy on thy people, Lord.
[time=532] [AMEN] Kipling wrote that in the dying days of the British Empire.
[time=539] And he wrote it as a corrective to make sure that their trust wasn't being placed in stinking tubes and iron shards of warfare and the weapons of war.
[time=552] The British flag flew over as the poem says palm and pine.
[time=556] And he warned, he warned the people of the British Empire
[time=562] to not get complacent, to not be forgetful.
[time=567] And there is no British Empire today.
[time=571] Things have changed very radically in the last 100 years on that score.
[time=578] This morning, as we approached Deuteronomy 8, we are called to be unforgettable.
[time=584] We're called to be people who remember
[time=591] what God has done.
[time=592] I want to take a minute and if you would go back to Deuteronomy chapter four and just take a minute to go back from the last few weeks and things that have been talked about there, the first call in Deuteronomy four to Israel from Moses, Deuteronomy stands at a very important juncture in the Old Testament.
[time=609] Moses has the people of Israel and the plains of Moab looking across the Jordan River into the promised land, the land of promise, and they're not gonna go in.
[time=621] And he says, remember these things.
[time=623] Teach them to your children.
[time=626] Why?
[time=627] Because they are gonna go in, but you're not.
[time=631] Israel, listen verse one chapter four to the statutes, the rules that I am teaching you, and do them that you may live.
[time=640] Deuteronomy really is friends, it's like Moses's last will and testament.
[time=647] So before he fades off the scene, he says, I want you to know these, these are Moses's last words.
[time=654] Deuteronomy ends with Moses dying.
[time=656] So what would you want to tell somebody if it was the last thing you were gonna say?
[time=662] There's a lot in Deuteronomy.
[time=663] I know if you've noticed they're kind of a big book.
[time=665] So he has a lot to say to these people.
[time=669] Augustine said this and you saw this thread running through the first four weeks that we've been in Deuteronomy four, five, six, and seven.
[time=679] This thread of grace.
[time=681] Augustine said it's not that we keep his commandments first and then he loves us, but that he loves us and then we keep his commandments.
[time=691] That's grace.
[time=692] Your grace is enough we sang this morning.
[time=696] For me, grace is the story of the scriptures.
[time=700] God's redemptive work going on all the time.
[time=705] Deuteronomy four lays out this life that God has for his people, his intentions for them.
[time=711] If you will do what I say, it's his promise.
[time=714] Deuteronomy five is Moses repeating the Ten Commandments.
[time=717] Deuteronomy, the name Deuteronomy is taken from the Greek and it means second law.
[time=723] It's the law given all over again.
[time=725] So in case you missed it the first time, here it is again.
[time=728] The Ten Commandments are in Exodus chapter 20 and they're also in Deuteronomy chapter five.
[time=733] And every one of the Ten Commandments, but two is explicitly repeated in the New Testament.
[time=739] So Jesus says he doesn't come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it.
[time=744] And even the two that don't explicitly repeat themselves in the New Testament, the principles are definitely there about a Sabbath day and about having no other gods before him, certainly.
[time=755] So is this for us today?
[time=758] Yes.
[time=760] Right over it told me recently that at the Christian bookstore's association, there was a survey and they asked people to think it's in the Ten Commandments.
[time=768] And guess what percentage of people that were there could say the Ten Commandments?
[time=773] Four, four percent of the people that were there.
[time=777] The danger of forgetting the very things that we ought not to forget is very, very real.
[time=786] We live in that danger all the time.
[time=789] You will walk in that danger tomorrow.
[time=792] You've heard God's word today.
[time=793] You're going to hear more of it this morning and you're going to say, yes, your heart will resonate and say, yes, that's right.
[time=799] That's good.
[time=801] And then tomorrow's going to come.
[time=803] And you're going to feel pressures.
[time=804] And there's going to be that person at work who annoys you.
[time=808] And you're going to have that alarm go off.
[time=810] And you're going to go, oh, you know, or you're going to have another disagreement with your spouse.
[time=816] And we are prone to forget.
[time=818] And by the way, friends, that's why we need to be together week after week.
[time=823] We need to be together, to be reminded, to stir each other up by way of reminder.
[time=830] To sing songs together that says, we will choose to remember.
[time=834] Jesus has fulfilled perfectly every expectation
[time=845] of the law in such a way that I could never do that.
[time=850] And so all of God's dealings with me in Christ are now through him and aren't you glad?
[time=857] Because if he dealt with me based on how you're doing on this obedience track, Steve, my hands would go up.
[time=865] I got nothing.
[time=868] There are no good people in the Bible.
[time=871] Now, there's no list of heroes in the Bible.
[time=873] We often say that, but they're not heroes in the Bible.
[time=876] Name me one person in the Bible that God's favor wasn't on first and then good things happen for them.
[time=884] Noah's just a guy and God has favor on him that he's righteous.
[time=888] Abraham was a coward.
[time=890] David had his flandering problems.
[time=893] Solomon wasn't an idolature.
[time=896] Jonah was somebody who outright said, I'm not going to do it.
[time=899] I love how the Jesus story of the Bible says about Jonah.
[time=901] One ticket to not Nineveh, please.
[time=906] So everybody in the Bible, friends, every one of them, Noah was a drinker.
[time=911] And on and on it goes, there are no good people in the Bible.
[time=914] There are people on whom God shines his face, just like me.
[time=921] I still remember the day he saved me.
[time=924] If I am saved, that means I need saving.
[time=928] Saving from what?
[time=930] The just desserts of my faithlessness and my lostness.
[time=936] The Bible is not a collection of a whole bunch of different stories.
[time=939] It's one story all the way through of God's redemption.
[time=943] Even so far back in Genesis chapter 3, when the seed of the woman is going to crush the head of the serpent, that's beautiful.
[time=952] In Deuteronomy 6, we saw the Shema, the prayer that is prayed every morning by the Jewish people.
[time=959] Shema, Yisrael, Adonai, Elohainu, Adonai, Echad, every morning, every morning.
[time=965] Hero Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[time=969] In the first word of chapter 6 is the word of verse 4, rather, is the word here in Deuteronomy 6, 4.
[time=974] It's a command here.
[time=977] It's like chapter 4 in this sense of hearing.
[time=979] Look at Deuteronomy 6 and verse 20.
[time=982] Just ask a series of questions.
[time=984] What's God asking his people to do?
[time=985] Why is he asking him to do it?
[time=987] How will they do it?
[time=989] And I was drawn to this this morning, 6 verse 20.
[time=992] When your son asks you in time to come, what's the meaning of the testimonies and the statutes and the rules that the Lord your God has commanded you, 'cause they were commanded to teach them to their kids?
[time=1004] Then you shall say to your son, we were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt, and the Lord brought us out.
[time=1010] Your kids need to hear that story about your life.
[time=1015] I was in slavery to sin, and God brought me out.
[time=1019] This year-owned bootstraps story, we love that American story.
[time=1024] By my own boot, I made this thing happen to my own, we both people, we both people like that, you know?
[time=1029] Look how, look what they've made of themselves.
[time=1031] That's a great inspirational story in the political front, but not in my spiritual life.
[time=1035] The Lord showed signs and wonders, great and grievous against Egypt and against Pharaoh and against all his household.
[time=1045] Before our eyes, he brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land he swore to give to our fathers.
[time=1053] They will do that because of what God has done.
[time=1058] They're all their obedience.
[time=1060] All of their actions are only in response to the great things that God has done.
[time=1064] Josh quoted from the gospel primer and Milton Vincent, who said this, "Every time I deliberately disobey a command of God, "it's because I'm in that moment doubtful "about God's true intentions in giving me that command." It's like what Satan did in the garden.
[time=1082] Did God really say, did God really say that?
[time=1086] That's what we're doing in our own minds.
[time=1088] It's like the Bugs Bunny cartoons with the devil and the angel on the shoulder.
[time=1093] So you guys remember those from years gone by?
[time=1094] Maybe you don't.
[time=1096] But this dialogue in our heads of, "Did God really say that?
[time=1099] "Should I really do this?
[time=1100] "Should I really not do that?" Last week was Deuteronomy chapter seven.
[time=1106] Everyone is devoted to something.
[time=1114] The human heart is an idol factory.
[time=1117] Somebody once said, "We just longed to be devoted to football teams "or companies or a musical group.
[time=1127] "We do that.
[time=1128] "We are by nature that kind of people." When we determined, Kelly said last week, what exactly it is that we are devoted to, we may in fact need an adjustment 'cause you can't fake it.
[time=1140] You can't fake what you're devoted to.
[time=1142] Your time, your talent, your treasure will go that way.
[time=1145] Where is it going?
[time=1146] Dia Carson said as we move into chapter eight this morning, he said, "People don't drift toward holiness." You don't put it into neutral and then all of a sudden just drift in the right direction.
[time=1163] My drift is always in the wrong direction.
[time=1165] And he calls us to grace-driven effort.
[time=1170] Obedience to God fueled by his grace that he loves us so much that he has done these marvelous things for us that we did not deserve.
[time=1180] And now friends, chapter eight of Deuteronomy.
[time=1182] Here we go.
[time=1183] There's an outline in your bulletins.
[time=1186] If you'd like to follow along the notes, they're all there for you.
[time=1191] Let's read verses one and two of Deuteronomy eight.
[time=1193] I won't hurry, but I need to get going with you today.
[time=1197] The whole commandment that I command you today, you shall be careful to do that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land, the Lord swore to give to your fathers.
[time=1209] The first thing Moses commands is to be careful to do.
[time=1213] The doing comes first, then living, then multiply, then going in, then possessing.
[time=1221] There is no substitute for obedience.
[time=1224] On the ground, I'm doing it, I'm obedient.
[time=1228] Teresa of Avilla, I love this quote.
[time=1229] It's in the wall of my classroom, I think.
[time=1232] But the quote is this, a 16th century Saint Teresa.
[time=1236] She said, "I know the power obedience has "of making things easy which seem impossible." Obedience, I'm going to do what God tells me to do.
[time=1248] And in the face of that, mountains become foothills.
[time=1253] In the face of just everyday obedience.
[time=1257] Even I don't want you, but I'm going to be obedient.
[time=1259] There's a real sense also of friends in which there's a momentum to obedience too.
[time=1263] Then my obedience today informs obedience tomorrow.
[time=1270] So one act of obedience today means that tomorrow when I'm tempted or when I struggle or when I have doubts, I can trust him in light of what he's already done.
[time=1277] Romans 12 tells the story, a living sacrifice.
[time=1281] Then you'll know what God's will is.
[time=1283] What a blessing.
[time=1286] The route from Egypt to the promised land was about 250 miles, about a month's journey.
[time=1294] How long were they out there in the wilderness?
[time=1299] 40 years, whoops.
[time=1302] A month's journey takes 40.
[time=1305] Can you imagine a road trip gone that badly?
[time=1310] I mean, my goodness gracious.
[time=1312] Why so long?
[time=1315] Why not a month?
[time=1318] Verse two, you shall remember, remembering comes after all of the obedience.
[time=1326] Remember, the whole way the Lord your God has led you these 40 years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart, whether you keep his commandments or not.
[time=1339] There were no props, there were no supports out there to say, I'm gonna obey God 'cause things are really going well.
[time=1346] There was no food to eat, there was nothing out there.
[time=1349] And God makes bread rain from the sky.
[time=1354] And they're like, what is this?
[time=1355] So they call it manna, which means what is this?
[time=1359] Brain, bread, brain, bread, raining from the sky, friends.
[time=1364] Nothing to eat, Moses.
[time=1366] Let's go back, we got lots of food to eat in Egypt.
[time=1368] Let's go back.
[time=1369] Bread, raining forecast today, raining bread.
[time=1374] I'm sick of this bread, Moses.
[time=1378] I want some meat, quails by the millions until it's coming out their nostrils, number says.
[time=1384] What kind of people are these people?
[time=1387] Just like me, just like me.
[time=1392] There was a motion picture a couple years ago about Nelson Mandela called Invictus.
[time=1399] It's taken from a poem by William Ernest Henley.
[time=1402] The poem sustained him in his prison cell under years of abuse and neglect.
[time=1407] Here's how the poem ends.
[time=1409] It matters not how straight the gate, how charged with punishments to the scroll.
[time=1415] I am the master of my fate.
[time=1417] I am the captain of my soul.
[time=1419] And that's sustained Nelson Mandela in times they're very, very bleak.
[time=1423] But that's not the purpose of the wandering and the wilderness, so they could say, I can do it.
[time=1429] I am strong enough.
[time=1430] The whole purpose was to see, will you trust me?
[time=1433] 'Cause nothing else to lean on.
[time=1435] Will you trust me or not?
[time=1437] Jesus quotes the next verse, verse three, of course.
[time=1445] In the wilderness period, in his own wilderness period, he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you didn't know, nor did your fathers know that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.
[time=1464] Every word that you may know this to be true.
[time=1469] So a new Joshua comes in Matthew's gospel to lead who is obedient to God, unlike the people of Israel obedient, and his obedience leads us into the ultimate land of promise.
[time=1483] His obedience leads us to divine provision for eternal life.
[time=1489] The city in Revelation, chapters 20 and 21 and 22 will never be under threat.
[time=1497] That's the inheritance that Christ makes available to us.
[time=1500] Much better than a piece of land on the Eastern Mediterranean.
[time=1504] Much, much better.
[time=1505] Look at verse four of Deuteronomy eight.
[time=1509] The heading there in your outline's friends was to remember, and we should remember because God is our guide.
[time=1515] Remember that God is our guide.
[time=1518] That's the first thing to say.
[time=1519] Your clothing, verse four, did not wear out on you, and your foot didn't swell these 40 years.
[time=1527] I spent a week on the Appalachian Trail, and that was not my experience.
[time=1532] About two days then I had the wrong kind of shoes, and my feet were swelling, and I was in misery.
[time=1537] Cool mountain stream, about Wednesday of that week, I put my feet in that water, and it was the best moment, maybe, of my life.
[time=1545] To that point, it was a long time ago.
[time=1547] Your feet didn't swell for 40, your clothes didn't wear out.
[time=1552] How many pairs of shoes you bought in the last 40 years?
[time=1555] Lots of pairs of shoes.
[time=1558] How many pairs of clothing, pants, shirts, sweaters have you bought in the last 40 years?
[time=1563] It's a miracle.
[time=1564] It's reported in Deuteronomy 29, and Nehemiah 9, just oh by the way, it really did happen that way.
[time=1570] What's my response?
[time=1572] Follow.
[time=1574] Follow after him.
[time=1576] Moses in Exodus 15 sings this song on the far side of the Red Sea, and I find it remarkable.
[time=1581] It's in Exodus 15.
[time=1583] He says, "You have led in your steadfast love, your hased, the people whom you have redeemed.
[time=1591] You've guided them by your strength to your holy abode." And then he tells about how the people of the land of Canaan were trembling with fear, but they weren't even there yet.
[time=1600] This is how far God's provision goes.
[time=1603] The people that were in the land, where they were gonna go, were already shaking with fear.
[time=1608] Like, oh no, that's amazing.
[time=1612] God is a good leader, and so we can follow him with great confidence.
[time=1618] He's also a guardian in verses five and six.
[time=1622] Take a look.
[time=1623] Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son,
[time=1629] the Lord your God disciplines you.
[time=1633] You shall keep the commandments of the Lord your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him.
[time=1639] God's fatherhood is put on display by his discipline.
[time=1644] Does God's fatherhood show itself and his love for us?
[time=1649] Yes.
[time=1652] Is that the only thing that we see?
[time=1654] No.
[time=1655] A father who loves his children shows that by disciplining them.
[time=1660] If he doesn't, so it goes, he doesn't.
[time=1665] Look at Hebrews chapter 12, Hebrews 12.
[time=1669] This is so very appropriate.
[time=1673] God's discipline is prompted by love.
[time=1678] You are a parent.
[time=1679] Many of you are parents.
[time=1681] And you think if you discipline them that they won't love you.
[time=1684] It doesn't matter what they think.
[time=1686] Your discipline should be motivated by love.
[time=1689] If you love your children, you will discipline them.
[time=1693] If you don't love them, you won't discipline them.
[time=1695] So it goes.
[time=1696] Verse five, Hebrews 12, have you forgotten?
[time=1701] The whole call of Deuteronomy eight is to remember.
[time=1705] And so he says, the author of Hebrews says in chapter 12, "Have you forgotten the exhortation "that addresses you as sons?" From Proverbs three, "My son, do not regard lightly "the discipline of the Lord, "or be weary when reproved by him, "because the Lord disciplines the one he loves "and chastises every son whom he receives." It's for discipline that you have to endure.
[time=1729] God is treating you as sons.
[time=1732] For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
[time=1736] If you are left without discipline in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
[time=1743] Wow.
[time=1744] God as a guardian.
[time=1747] So I obey.
[time=1750] God as a God, so I follow.
[time=1752] God is also verse seven of Deuteronomy eight, a giver.
[time=1757] God as giver.
[time=1759] Look at verse seven with me.
[time=1762] "The Lord your God is bringing you into a good land." I have a ramp here, so I'm gonna use it.
[time=1770] I can't normally do this.
[time=1773] When God says something is good, he means it.
[time=1780] He creates the universe.
[time=1783] At the end it says, at the end of all his creation, he says, "It's good, I believe him." And so when God describes this land as a good land, I'm gonna choose to believe him.
[time=1796] Listen how it's described.
[time=1798] The Lord your God's bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, fountains and springs, flowing out of the valleys and hills, a land of wheat and barley, vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey, a land in which you will eat bread without scarcity in which you will lack nothing.
[time=1821] A land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills you can dig copper and you shall eat and be full, all of these things.
[time=1830] A more wonderful place could hardly be imagined.
[time=1837] What a great contrast to the wilderness, the desert.
[time=1842] Well there's nothing there, it's still a desert today.
[time=1847] What kind of people deserved this inheritance, this good land flowing with milk and honey and agricultural bounty and the right kind of rocks?
[time=1860] The right kind of rocks?
[time=1862] Chapter nine is after chapter eight and now we have a little bit of an idea of this.
[time=1869] Verse six, "Know therefore the Lord your God
[time=1875] is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness for you are a stubborn people." God gave him a good land 'cause they were good people.
[time=1888] No, God did not set his affection on the Israelites because they were so numerous and so wise and so powerful and so this and so that.
[time=1898] Just read the book of Numbers this week.
[time=1901] It's the story of their wilderness wanderings and it's a bleak story, my friends.
[time=1906] It's a bleak story.
[time=1908] We are just like them.
[time=1913] There are no hero stories in the Bible.
[time=1917] There's one person to whom the story all flows and his name is Jesus.
[time=1922] Revelation five, there is this unbelievable morning because there's nobody found who can open the scroll except the lamb who was slain.
[time=1933] All of this, this real sense friends in which everything in the Bible leads us to that point.
[time=1939] None of those people are worthy.
[time=1941] No one's worthy.
[time=1942] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not worthy.
[time=1945] Moses and Joseph and David are not worthy.
[time=1950] Only the lamb.
[time=1953] The Bible is one story.
[time=1957] It's a story of a broken and corrupt people who are caught up in the redemptive symphony that God is playing and Jesus is his inspiration.
[time=1966] He's the theme of the symphony that he's playing.
[time=1970] Ephesians two says this.
[time=1974] God being rich in mercy because of the great love with which he loved us even when we were dead and our trespasses made us alive together with Christ by grace you've been saved.
[time=1984] It's the same story.
[time=1985] The land of promised friends is a gracious gift by a good God to a wayward people and eternal life in Christ is a gracious gift by loving God to a wayward people.
[time=1997] It's the same story.
[time=1999] What's the Bible basically about?
[time=2001] It's basically about that.
[time=2004] So God is a giver so we should be thankful.
[time=2009] Look at verse 10 in their response.
[time=2011] You shall eat and be full and you shall bless the Lord your God for the good land he's given you.
[time=2021] How much more should we bless him for what Colossians describes as the immeasurable riches of the grace of God in Christ.
[time=2029] Immeasurable riches more than a good land with pomegranates more than the right kind of rocks.
[time=2035] We in barley which was good.
[time=2038] Immeasurable riches of grace.
[time=2041] How much more should we be thankful?
[time=2043] So second Roman numeral in the notes is the second half of the passage is take care.
[time=2051] The first was remember now we have this admonishment this morning to take care and don't forget verse 11.
[time=2058] Do you run on me eight?
[time=2061] Take care lest you forget.
[time=2063] Sounds like a poem we read recently.
[time=2066] The Lord your God by not keeping his commandments and his rules and statutes that command you today, lest when you have eaten and are full and have built good houses and live in them and when your herds and flocks multiply, your silver and gold is multiplied and all that you have is multiplied.
[time=2084] There are different kinds of sin friends.
[time=2088] All sin is the same.
[time=2090] It's unfamiliar too.
[time=2091] But there are sins of co-mission.
[time=2093] There are sins by things that we do and there are sins of omission.
[time=2096] There are things that we sin by not doing.
[time=2099] James 4 says this.
[time=2102] Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it for him it's sin.
[time=2107] I told my grow group on Thursday night that the problem that I have with the Bible sometimes isn't what I don't understand but what I do.
[time=2116] Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it for him it is sin.
[time=2121] I know exactly what that means and it stings.
[time=2125] We forget through disobedience.
[time=2132] Forgiveness leads to a kind of passivity, a kind of couch potato mentality which goes to complacency, not to contentment.
[time=2142] There is a place for God with contentment friends is great gain and the enemy of that is complacency.
[time=2148] They are not the same.
[time=2149] Don't confuse them.
[time=2151] I am resting in what God has done.
[time=2153] I am resting but I have done.
[time=2155] That's the difference.
[time=2157] It's a very huge difference.
[time=2160] Moses in this passage guys is looking like three steps ahead of the people of Israel.
[time=2165] They're in the land of promise yet but they've already got houses and they've got fields and they got animals, they got silver and gold.
[time=2172] They're in the plains of Moab right now.
[time=2174] He's three steps ahead when you go in and you conquer them and you dwell in the land.
[time=2179] He's already in like Thursday of this week already.
[time=2184] God your week will not take God by surprise.
[time=2191] By Friday, God will know exactly what's happened to you and everything you experience along the way is by his design.
[time=2197] How could that be Steve?
[time=2201] How could God design that?
[time=2202] I don't know but God is looking ahead from his people for what's best for them way into the future.
[time=2210] Every one of your days has been ordered by him.
[time=2214] He is faithful and he will always be faithful and you can trust him.
[time=2219] Could somebody say amen to that?
[time=2221] Okay.
[time=2222] Don't forget through disobedience, through sins of omission, things that you don't do.
[time=2228] Don't forget also a letter B in your outline.
[time=2232] Don't forget also here through pride.
[time=2235] Verse 14, so when you have all these houses and stuff and silver and gold, your heart be lifted up and you forget the Lord, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
[time=2245] You hear that refrain over and over again because they're prone to forget.
[time=2251] By the way, God brought you out.
[time=2253] There's a terrifying, the Old Testament alive it is really terrifying stuff.
[time=2257] David has a son through Bathsheba named Solomon who fades off the scene, who dies at the end of Second Kings and he dies in the books of Kings, excuse me.
[time=2271] And when he dies, his commander, Jeroboam and his son, Reoboam, divide the kingdom up.
[time=2279] Ten tribes in the north, two tribes in the south.
[time=2281] And Jeroboam, his commander, his administrator says, the first thing he says as king is, these golden calves brought you out of Egypt.
[time=2290] That's his first major act as king of what now is the nation of Israel.
[time=2295] Why?
[time=2298] Because they had forgotten.
[time=2299] Solomon had 700 wives.
[time=2304] Solomon had forgotten.
[time=2310] Solomon, there was never going to be a wiser person in history than Solomon.
[time=2314] God promised him that.
[time=2315] Wow, we are forgetful people, my friends.
[time=2320] And my pride often leaves me to this end.
[time=2323] Verse 15, "He led you through the great and terrifying wilderness, fiery serpents, scorpion, thirsty ground, where there was no water, who brought you water, the flinty rock, he fed you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers didn't know, that he might humble you to test you, to do you good in the end." The end is always good things from him.
[time=2343] C.S. Lewis said that pride leads to every other vice.
[time=2347] It's a complete, he said, anti-God, state of mind.
[time=2350] It's the one thing that every other vice leads to.
[time=2355] It's pride comes before destruction.
[time=2358] Proverbs 16 says that.
[time=2359] And a haughty spirit before a fall.
[time=2362] Write a reference down in your Bolton, if you would please, a reference.
[time=2366] A reference is 2nd Chronicles 26.
[time=2369] 2nd Chronicles 26 is a story of a king named Eusiah.
[time=2372] 2nd Chronicles 26.
[time=2376] Take a minute of this week and read that story in the light of all we've talked about today and the danger of forgetfulness and what happens to Eusiah when he becomes proud.
[time=2384] Lastly, "So I shouldn't forget and become disobedient.
[time=2390] I shouldn't forget and become prideful." Verse 17, Deuteronomy 8 in conclusion.
[time=2397] "Beware lest you say in your heart, my power and the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth.
[time=2402] You shall remember the Lord your God for it's he who gives you power to get wealth.
[time=2410] That he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your fathers." There are strong warnings in the Lord here, guys.
[time=2417] Verse 11 says, "Take care." Verse 17 says, "Beware." Verse 19 will go on to say, "I solemnly warn you." The same thing that will happen to the nations of Canaan who are dispossessed will happen to Israel if they don't listen, if they don't remember.
[time=2433] It's a frightful end.
[time=2435] I'm sorry to say it's exactly what happens as you read the rest of the Old Testament.
[time=2439] It's exactly what happens to them.
[time=2441] They forget and they forget and they forget some more and foreign nations enter in and carry them away in chains.
[time=2447] The last 12 books of the Old Testament are the minor prophets and because they aren't important but because they're small.
[time=2455] And those minor prophets are running to kings at two different stages.
[time=2458] One is before they leave and to exile and Deuteronomy A comes to pass.
[time=2463] And one of them is those running people who are in the exile who already are slaves in foreign land.
[time=2470] We are prone to forget especially as American people.
[time=2477] We have so very much operation Christmas child.
[time=2484] If I gave my kids a shoebox for Christmas, I'm ashamed to say they wouldn't speak to me for a long time and that is an indictment on me.
[time=2493] When these children and friends will burn with joy
[time=2499] at a shoebox with toothpaste, my self-sufficiency, my pridefulness
[time=2510] does not lead me to good things, it leads me to complacency.
[time=2513] You did this.
[time=2515] You look at all that you have.
[time=2516] Look how hard you've worked.
[time=2518] You deserve it.
[time=2520] No, you don't.
[time=2521] No, I don't.
[time=2523] I deserve hell and I get Jesus in my place.
[time=2526] It's overwhelming.
[time=2530] I am prone to forget you are too.
[time=2534] It's what we need to be here together week after week to celebrate God's goodness together.
[time=2540] 'Cause I forget by Wednesday I'm a forgetful person.
[time=2543] When temptation comes my way, I in that moment forget, I doubt God's goodness.
[time=2549] Does God really have what's best in mind for me?
[time=2551] I don't know, maybe doesn't.
[time=2552] The wisest of women builds her house,
[time=2559] but folly with her own hands tears it down.
[time=2562] Proverbs 14, verse one.
[time=2564] Another poem to read with you at the end of our time this morning.
[time=2571] This one's by Percy Shelly, Percy Biss Shelly.
[time=2574] It's called Aussie Mandyus.
[time=2576] It will be on the screens behind me.
[time=2578] I met a traveler from an antique land who said, "Too vast and trunkless, "legs of stone stand in the desert.
[time=2590] "near them on the sand, "half sunk a shattered face, "visage lies whose frown and wrinkled lip "and sneer of cold command tell its sculptor well "those passions read which yet survived, "stamped on these lifeless things.
[time=2610] "The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.
[time=2614] "And on the pedestal, these words appear.
[time=2617] "My name is Aussie Mandyus, King of Kings.
[time=2621] "Look on my works ye mighty and despair.
[time=2625] "Nothing beside remains.
[time=2630] "Round the decay of that colossal wreck, "boundless and bare, the lone and level sands, "stretch far away." Pray with me.
[time=2643] Heavenly Father, it's good to call you that.
[time=2649] May we bear your discipline this week as sons.
[time=2651] We are forgetful people.
[time=2656] Your son Jesus told us to approach the elements
[time=2663] in remembrance of him.
[time=2665] Why?
[time=2667] Because I forget my debt before you.
[time=2672] O to grace how great a debtor.
[time=2677] Daily, I'm constrained to be.
[time=2680] Take your goodness God like a fetter and bind my wandering heart to you today.
[time=2686] May that be our story.
[time=2687] Thank you for being a guide and a guardian and a giver.
[time=2692] Keep us from forgetting through disobedience.
[time=2697] Keep us from forgetting through pride and self-sufficiency.
[time=2701] Pray that Father in Jesus name with great thanksgiving.
[time=2705] [AMEN] Would you go with me please to first Corinthians chapter 11 as we transition now?
[time=2712] First Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 17.
[time=2719] It would seem as though the Corinthian church had forgotten something.
[time=2725] First Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 17.
[time=2732] In the following instructions, I do not commend you because when you come together, it's not for the better, but for the worse, for in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear there are divisions among you.
[time=2745] And I believe it in part for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.
[time=2753] When you come together, it isn't the Lord's Supper that you eat, for in eating each one goes ahead with his own meal.
[time=2759] One goes hungry, another gets drunk.
[time=2762] What?
[time=2764] Do you not have houses to eat and drink in?
[time=2768] Do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing?
[time=2771] What shall I say to you?
[time=2774] Shall I commend you in this?
[time=2777] No, I will not.
[time=2780] And then Paul says the familiar words that we'll read together in a few minutes.
[time=2786] The Corinthians had forgotten the surpassing wonder of the gift of Christ.
[time=2795] As we listen to you and sing these words together, you may come get the elements as you are led to.
[time=2802] I pray that you would be a person who remembers
[time=2808] and in so doing our obedient to what Christ has said to us.
