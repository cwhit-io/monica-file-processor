[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - We're gonna have some folks come up on stage and you're gonna get a chance this morning here as we start to hear some stories.
[time=39] You're gonna hear some testimonies of those who have been willing to go.
[time=44] And if you've been around Black Hawk at all over the last five years, you know, that we really have done our very best with God's help to try and instill in you to kind of create in us an understanding that God has absolutely, without any confusion at all about it, God has called us as his people to go.
[time=66] To go across the street, to go across town, to go across the world, and to as priests, the priesthood of all believers we are, as his going priests, we are to pass along his attributes, his grace and his kindness and his truth to those in this world.
[time=84] And we can do that in a number of ways.
[time=86] And I'm so grateful for so many of you who go on a regular basis.
[time=91] And this morning, I want you to meet some folks who have gone and God has done great things in the midst of their going across the world and back.
[time=100] I want you to welcome this morning Jan, Sarah, Brittany, Shelly, and Doug.
[time=105] Thankful that they could be here.
[time=106] (audience applauding) And I wanna just kind of rattle through here and we're gonna have a lot of time, but I want you to hear some of the things that God has done and it continues to do with these folks.
[time=119] I think because of their willingness and their readiness to go.
[time=122] Jan Cox, Jan's been a part of our family here at Black Hawk for about 35 years.
[time=130] She's been an occupational therapist for about 36 years and that occupational therapy, that heart and that gifting, that talent to come alongside those with physical needs and obviously even spiritual and emotional needs.
[time=146] Jan's just been faithful to serve in that capacity and to use her gifts for those people and for the kingdom for years.
[time=153] Recently, she had a chance.
[time=155] She wasn't really looking for it.
[time=157] She was open, but just an amazing way that God worked.
[time=161] Sometimes on these trips, they're all planned out.
[time=163] We know it's coming.
[time=164] I want you to listen as Jan just tells you about how her trip to South Sudan came to be and what she was able to do there.
[time=173] It's a really encouraging story.
[time=174] So Jan, share with the folks briefly how that came to be.
[time=177] - I love it when I get to see God clearly leading and working.
[time=183] Last March, I got a phone call from the parent of a former student that I worked with Fort Wayne community schools.
[time=191] She has started a ministry for people with special needs in South Sudan.
[time=196] There were three particular individuals she had in mind that needed wheelchairs.
[time=202] I've done some volunteer work with wheels for the world in the past with Jonny and friends.
[time=207] She had contacted Jonny and friends to get wheelchairs.
[time=211] They gave permission for those to be obtained, but they said that there had to be a therapist that would go along to make sure that they fit the people correctly.
[time=221] You can cause a lot of problems if they aren't fitted correctly.
[time=226] If you saw the picture of the young man, all kind of pretzeled up, lying in a wheelbarrow, that was one of the pictures she emailed me.
[time=237] That was Martin and she emailed me a picture of Winnie, the little girl on the mat, and another individual named Jackson.
[time=247] And she said, do you know of anybody that might be able to do this?
[time=252] And I said, well, let me pray about it.
[time=254] My husband and I had been giving some money, a little bit before that, and I was asking God, you know, if there was something he wanted me to do in terms of a missions trip.
[time=267] So this door opened and I just started putting feelers out and God brought it all together, really at a pretty short amount of time.
[time=274] She contacted me in March by phone.
[time=278] We met in April by the end of May.
[time=281] I knew I was going.
[time=283] August 1st, I left and got back just in time,
[time=289] like the Friday or Saturday before the therapist came back to start the new school year.
[time=293] So it all worked out.
[time=295] And I want to mention too, the importance of these people having a wheelchair meant that they could go to school.
[time=304] The young man in the wheelbarrow could have learned English, a little bit of English from the radio, so he certainly had intelligence.
[time=311] And at the school they would attend, there was a Bible class.
[time=314] So this opened up huge doors for them.
[time=317] - I'm just glad for God's leading.
[time=319] - Absolutely, absolutely, thanks, Jan.
[time=321] And I want to just, before Sarah jumps in, I want to just capture a little phrase, Jan, just kind of slipped in there.
[time=327] And I know it was a significant part of her story, but I want to just see if maybe it could ever be a significant part of yours.
[time=334] She got a little bit of extra money.
[time=337] And she asked God, if maybe with that extra money,
[time=343] he wanted her to go.
[time=346] And I wonder what we do with extra money.
[time=351] Where does your mind go, where do our plans go?
[time=355] Just something to think about, all right?
[time=358] Sarah Rogers, hi Sarah.
[time=360] - Good morning.
[time=361] - It's good to have you here.
[time=362] Sarah has been a part of our family here for years.
[time=365] I think she started in 19, late 1970s.
[time=368] She has been a part of this family, her and her daughter Brooke.
[time=372] Brooke is, is she here right now this morning?
[time=375] Hey, Brooke.
[time=377] Brooke is a wonderful, special needs, special woman, special gal, special, special, special.
[time=383] She's a blessing to anyone who knows her.
[time=385] We love you, Brooke.
[time=386] Oh, you can stay there, it's okay.
[time=387] I just wanted to say hi to you.
[time=388] Yes, kisses to you too.
[time=390] She's just a dear gal.
[time=392] And Sarah and Brooke really have been on this journey together, and I just wanted Sarah to tell a little bit about how this all started.
[time=400] It was at a Ray Bolts concert back in the 90s, and God really nudged you about going.
[time=406] - In 1995, I took Brooke to a Ray Bolts concert, and at Intermission, they were showing pictures of Sir Lanka, and the baby's drinking the river water.
[time=416] I'm in the health field, so it just, it broke my heart.
[time=421] And it was at that time that God said, "Well, are you gonna go?" And I said, "Yes, I'll go." And I turned to Brooke and said, "God just called me to Africa." Well, you know, Brooke, she goes, "Well, I'm going too." And I thought she would be my travel companion.
[time=439] I have been so amazed at the fact that God had a ministry for her, and she works the orphanage over there, and the children just literally love her.
[time=451] They never want her to come home.
[time=453] So while I'm working the clinic, an AIDS clinic in the lab, she's working the orphanage over there.
[time=461] - Awesome, awesome.
[time=462] And you know, the truth of the matter is, the Bolts concert was in the late 1990s.
[time=468] It wasn't until 2004, 2006, somewhere in there that she began to, and Brooke began to go.
[time=475] But once they started going, they haven't stopped.
[time=479] I believe Sarah will go along with Brooke again next fall on their 10th trip over to Kenya, and they are just more and more so.
[time=491] Each and every time they go, they are falling more and more in love with these kids and these people, and the mission that God has them on there to bring his love and his justice and his grace.
[time=503] You're not getting younger, but you just keep going.
[time=508] And I just want you to speak to the fact that, you know, she's at a point in life where a lot of folks are slowing down, and she just keeps going.
[time=515] And I know there's unique circumstances and such, but why do you keep, how does that work?
[time=520] How do you just keep going?
[time=522] And then secondly, what's the end game for you?
[time=525] I know the answer to that question, but I want you to share it with them.
[time=528] - Well, I work in radiology, which I've been in radiology for 43 years, wondering why radiology as much as I love it, radiology and lab.
[time=538] And God answered that a couple years ago when we found this clinic, and we bonded with them, and I worked the lab over there.
[time=546] And they're in a building project, and they need an X-ray machine because AIDS people, a lot of them get malaria and TB.
[time=555] So we need an X-ray machine.
[time=557] And working at Parkview, I knew I could get an old X-ray machine over there.
[time=564] So our game plan, God's game plan, is that within the next year and a half, we will have the X-ray room built over at Zion Clinic.
[time=576] Brooke and I will be moving over there permanently then to I'll be working the clinic.
[time=581] She will stay up at orphanage, and that really is home to us.
[time=585] I took her in '05 to get her acclimated, and it has been home to her in '07.
[time=593] In '07, that was home to her, and has always wanted to stay there.
[time=600] So that was God's confirming call that this is where we are to be.
[time=606] - That's awesome, that's great.
[time=608] Yeah, yeah, you can praise God for that.
[time=610] (audience applauds) Hey Brittany, good to have you here.
[time=615] - Hi.
[time=616] - This is Brittany King, and she was part of a trip that went this past summer, went to high school and college age kids, along with some wonderful supervision provided by Doug Crane and Chad Birch, Amy Hannah, Janice Marie-Z, and I just have asked Brittany to share with you a little bit about what was going on in her life prior to going, and then how that experience has now really changed her, and very likely her future as she looks ahead.
[time=645] So Brittany, share with the folks what that's been like.
[time=648] - Around my senior year of high school and to my freshman sophomore years of college, I sort of felt like my life had just stopped.
[time=657] Like, I didn't know what I was supposed to be doing with myself.
[time=661] I was struggling a lot in relationships with friends, God, just really kind of miserable, not knowing where I was supposed to go and where I was headed.
[time=672] And around December, I was at church and singing, and I just heard God speaking to me saying, Brittany, I still love you.
[time=685] I still have a plan for you, like, don't give up.
[time=688] And I reconciled with God around there, and really just started praying about, you know, okay, well, what now?
[time=695] What do I do now?
[time=696] And two weeks after that, Amy texted me and said, "Hey, do you want to go to Africa?" And if she had asked me before that, I probably would have said no, but I was like, yes, yes, I would love to go.
[time=708] And being there and just being with the tune done band and working at the orphanage, I realized I learned so many different things, you know, praise God in all circumstances and just how blessed we are just to be living here and everything that we have to be thankful for.
[time=728] And I also learned what a passion I had for children and for spreading the word of God and for ministering the people who are broken, because I felt like I went through a time that I was broken and God healed me and gave me hope and a joy and I just have such a fire for spreading that hope and joy to everyone that I possibly can.
[time=752] And it's really made me more kingdom minded and realized that, you know, the little things don't matter and that the kingdom is all that matters.
[time=761] So since I came home, I declared a major, I transferred to St. Francis and I am majoring in public relations and I want to do nonprofit work specifically for like missions, organizations and do a lot of traveling and considering going to Cambodia in January.
[time=781] And the thing about it is I have such a piece now before I was worried about, I always liked the idea of missions, but I was like kind of a germaphobe, like I'm a vegetarian, I don't know what I'm gonna eat, I don't know how I'll react to things.
[time=796] And none of that mattered when I was in Africa, it just, I was where I was supposed to be and that's the best feeling, knowing that you're exactly where God wants you.
[time=806] And I was just as blessed as we bless the people and I'm not worried about my future, I'm not worried about wherever God wants me, I know it'll be perfect, so.
[time=817] - That's awesome, that's awesome.
[time=818] Yeah, absolutely.
[time=819] (audience applauding) I've been to all the places that Brittany went, we've been over there a number of times, you cannot be a germaphobe and go to Nairobi and not come back a recovering germaphobe.
[time=835] So she is repenting of all of that and enjoying dirt and smells and all kinds of germs.
[time=841] It's good to have you back.
[time=842] Shaley is right here, Brittany, hi to Shaley.
[time=844] Shaley is a senior here at Blackhawk Christian High School and was a part of that trip as well this summer and I just asked her to talk a little bit about how going and coming back really has affected her 17 year old perspective, which is a valid one and we all know 17 year olds, but this 17 year old is different today because of what God did and I wanted her to just talk about what she saw, what she learned and where God has her going as she thinks about her future.
[time=876] - God really put Africa on my heart, my freshman year
[time=882] and so I was really happy that I got the opportunity to go this summer and it really changed.
[time=890] I guess what I think about my future when I came home, I started considering in college studying abroad maybe and just after
[time=902] possibly living there, moving there, I have such a heart for the people and God really broke my heart for the kids there when I went this summer.
[time=912] So it's just really changed my, what I thought about my future.
[time=916] I was worrying about, oh, should I be a veterinarian?
[time=920] Should I do, I didn't know, but coming back from that trip, I was really sure that this is what God wanted me to do and it just really put, it made me calm about my future and what he wants to do, I'm not 100% sure what's gonna happen yet, but I'm calm.
[time=941] - That's good, that's good, thank you, Shaley.
[time=943] Doug Crane, Doug's been, (audience applauding) Doug and Tammy have been a part of our family here for again a number of years.
[time=953] Doug and Tammy actually served on the mission field at the beginning of their marriage those first several years over in the Congo.
[time=961] Since then they came back, they've raised a family, all through those years, Doug stayed very involved in ministry, very involved in missions type activity, has gone on a number of trips with us, over to Nairobi, over to the orphanage where most of you know, we partner there with new life home trust.
[time=977] So this isn't for Doug, Doug going isn't like, oh, this is cool, I've never been, no, Doug knows the drill, but Doug and I were talking about what it means for him as kind of an older guy now getting to go on trips with younger guys and gals and seeing God work in them and I know it's meant a lot to him so I'm gonna just have him say a few things about that.
[time=998] Well, I was just sitting here thinking when I was in college there was this expression that the people that discipled me said there's more caught than taught, maybe you've heard that before.
[time=1008] And so when I heard about the opportunity to be part of a trip this summer with young people with high school and college kids, I thought I should be part of that because it's, I just love to see people who have never been exposed to a way of life outside of, you know, middle class suburbia to be exposed to that and to get a heart for what God is doing in other parts of the world.
[time=1038] So it was easy for me to say yes to the trip and to be part, you know, when I hear Shaley and Brittany talk about what God did in them that makes it worth it.
[time=1047] - Yeah, amen.
[time=1049] I just want to real quick, Doug's gonna say one last thing and then we're gonna move on with the morning.
[time=1054] I just want to just make sure that you're seeing this.
[time=1057] I want to make sure you're taking this in.
[time=1060] We've got a, we've got a businessman.
[time=1063] We've got a high school senior.
[time=1068] We've got a college junior.
[time=1071] We've got, we've got a mother of a, what mother of a special needs gal who has committed herself, you know, in the second half of her life to do all she can for that girl of hers and these kids in a place far, far away.
[time=1088] We've got a lady here who with her occupation, with the vocation God called her to, has figured out a way to take that and use that not only here but across the world.
[time=1099] So nobody in the room gets a pass.
[time=1105] Nobody in the room gets to not go.
[time=1109] And again, it might be across the street and it could be across town, but maybe, maybe, God would want you, whoever you are, to the next time you hear us talk about this, the next trip that comes along.
[time=1120] You're a mom and you think how could I get my kids covered?
[time=1123] You're a businessman or a woman and you think, how could you get your responsibilities covered?
[time=1127] You're older, you're younger.
[time=1129] You know what?
[time=1130] God does amazing things that you would never ever imagine and I hope this has been an encouragement to you and I hope your heart is bent toward maybe going in the days to come.
[time=1140] Doug, tell them how they can be a part of something tangible here today as they leave.
[time=1145] - Yeah, we do want to give you all an opportunity to be part of what we were part of and continue to be a part of.
[time=1153] So I'm making a couple shameless plugs for all of the money in your wallets and purses today.
[time=1159] Out in the lobby after the service, Sarah will be at a table over here.
[time=1165] She's collecting money for the project to build the X-ray room for this clinic that she's in.
[time=1172] Myself and Brittany and Shaley will be over at a table over here selling CDs of the group Tundim that we spent time with this summer.
[time=1182] They come out with their first ever CD.
[time=1184] It's $10, which is very reasonable and we'd love you to buy one of those just to support their ministry 'cause the proceeds go to that.
[time=1194] Plus we're also, there's gonna be a big shiny bucket on the table where we're collecting money for a new school that we're trying to build over in Kybera, one of the largest slums in Kenya.
[time=1208] And so it's called Project Five.
[time=1211] It's something that 212 has been working really hard on but we need a little extra horsepower to get that done.
[time=1215] So we're asking you to participate in that today as well.
[time=1219] - Awesome.
[time=1220] Would you all stand and would you just, I'm gonna ask you guys to stand as well.
[time=1224] I wanna just pray for these five and all the folks that they represent.
[time=1229] And I wanna just thank God for what he has done and I wanna just give them over to the Lord again as he continues to work in their lives and in their futures.
[time=1237] Would you just extend a hand toward them?
[time=1239] Would you as if we were all up here together?
[time=1241] Our Father in Heaven, we pray for these five who stand here today.
[time=1244] Oh God, we pray that you would continue to walk so very closely with them.
[time=1249] God, I pray that they would walk closely with you listening to and following the nudges and the direction and the leading that you give them.
[time=1257] God, I pray that their hearts would remain fixed and their eyes focused on you.
[time=1263] May they love no one or nothing more than they love you and may their willingness to go continue to only increase.
[time=1272] - Well, good morning and welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=1276] It is great to be with you again.
[time=1278] I'm so thankful every week to get the chance to spend a couple of minutes with you.
[time=1282] Those of you in our viewing audience, you know that we view you as part of our family and as part of our family, we have to tell you about what's coming again this December.
[time=1292] Most of you know that December here at Black Hawk means Christmas with Black Hawk.
[time=1297] It's a month long celebration each Sunday throughout December, a chance for us to celebrate through the arts, the great story of Christmas and there will be a phenomenal kids production.
[time=1311] There's gonna be a special choir and musical production, a special dramatic production put on by our drama team and from the singing that we'll do together to the things that you'll see and experience in the room, it's gonna be an amazing month and I can't wait for you to come and be a part of it.
[time=1330] If ever there was a time when you were gonna actually stop watching, if you will, and come and experience what goes on in our gathering live and in person, I'd love for it to be in the month of December.
[time=1343] We'll be here each Sunday, Christmas this Sunday, excuse me, Christmas this year falls on a Sunday and I hope you'll make plans to be with us then and Christmas Eve is gonna be as it always is, a special, special time of communion and celebration and bringing in this great day, this great event that we celebrate, the birth of our Lord.
[time=1364] So we'll celebrate it all month long and I can't wait for you to be here with us, Christmas with Black Hawk, beginning that first Sunday in December and going all the way through the month, it's gonna be a very special time and I hope you'll make the effort to come and be with us then.
[time=1380] God bless you, hope you enjoy the message today and we hope to see you this December.
[time=1385] - Deuteronomy chapter nine, we've entitled our series, Your Best Life Now.
[time=1393] And contrary to what some believe today, your best life now, we believe is not available to you through positive thinking, your best life now doesn't come when you declare your own destiny, know your best life now comes when you love and obey God and his word.
[time=1413] That's the life he designed you to live in relationship with him, doing and living and choosing the things he's called you to pursue and so that has been our theme, this life that God had for the people of Israel, there's life that he has for us and we come to chapter nine this morning, but before we jump into chapter nine, I wanna just, I wanna talk you through something that I think's really important that you understand.
[time=1435] So follow along here, don't miss this.
[time=1438] Over the past several weeks, we've been talking, teaching about the nation of Israel, camped out on the plains of Moab.
[time=1445] Remember, they've made their way to the plains of Moab on the bank of the Jordan River after 40 years of wandering after 40 years of literally circling the desert because of their unfaithfulness, because of their whining, because of their stubbornness, because of their rebellion.
[time=1463] God didn't feel like they were ready to come into the land that he had prepared, so he teaches them all these lessons along the way and for 40 years, that is their experience but now as Deuteronomy unfolds, it's time.
[time=1477] It's time for them to enter into the land, the promised land.
[time=1483] Now, I've been telling you from week one, that even though it's the Old Testament, that even though we're talking about the Israelites, I've been saying from week one that all of this is very applicable to you and me today.
[time=1498] And this morning, before we jump into the passage in Deuteronomy nine, I want every one of you to see something.
[time=1505] And this something that I want you to see, having seen it, I want every one of you to make a very personal, I believe very important connection between your life and this teaching.
[time=1519] This all kind of came to me as I had a discussion with a guy a couple weeks ago who said to me, great attitude, honestly just back and forth on this stuff.
[time=1527] He said, now Kelly, a lot of what we're hearing from you on Sundays is about all these Israelites getting ready to cross over into and live in this promised land.
[time=1539] He said to me, seems like the land seems like this land and how they lived in it was a pretty big deal to God.
[time=1550] Kind of makes me, he went on to see, it kind of makes me wish I had a land to live in.
[time=1556] It kind of makes me feel like we got left out.
[time=1558] They get this land and they get this thing with God and the way they're supposed to live in it and all these nations around it and the guy says, I kind of wish we had a land like that and it gave me this great opportunity to say to him, you do, you have a land.
[time=1579] You really do, this is all very applicable and I want to make sure that every one of you in this room this morning and those of you watching on the broadcast know that you have land, that he has given you and that there are expectations and opportunities that come with your land.
[time=1600] First thing I want you to see under the heading of the promised land, first thing I want you to understand about the land is that while it did consist of rivers, trees, hills, animals, valleys, vegetation, it, the land itself was in the bigger redemptive picture.
[time=1619] It was more than hills and valleys and vegetation and animals, it was a divinely right this down.
[time=1626] It was a divinely appointed setting within which God desired for them his people to love him while living out their faith.
[time=1637] This was the essence of the promised land.
[time=1641] I want to tell you two things about the promised land right here as we start, that's the first thing.
[time=1644] It was a divinely appointed setting, a setting within which they would live, loving him and living out their faith.
[time=1657] I hope you caught that, another way you could look at it is this, the promised land is really an essence of people.
[time=1663] All right, you with me?
[time=1664] It's a people in a place surrounded by other people in other places who would be these other peoples,
[time=1676] who would be attracted to the true and living God by the way his people lived in their place in their, what?
[time=1685] Their land.
[time=1686] And so I told this guy, everything we're studying on Sunday mornings about Israel and their land and how God wanted them to live in it and what would happen if they lived in it obediently is really very, very applicable.
[time=1699] So here's something for you to consider.
[time=1704] What's a divinely appointed setting in your life?
[time=1709] What is a setting that as you look at your life and please look at your life right now?
[time=1717] What is a divinely appointed God orchestrated it and you are in this setting?
[time=1723] And in this setting that God has you in, you have opportunities to speak to and influence the nations around you, the peoples around you as you live out your faith and love for God.
[time=1739] I wrote a few settings down.
[time=1742] You know what?
[time=1743] Your marriage, your marriage is a setting.
[time=1746] It is a land, if you will, that you have been placed in, divinely appointed.
[time=1752] And the way in which you live out your faith and the way in which you live out your love for God in the midst of your marriage is a tremendous opportunity for you to speak to, for you to proclaim the love and the mercies and the kindness of God to those who interact with, see are impacted by your marriage.
[time=1775] It's a divinely appointed setting within which you get to live out your love for God and your faith in Him.
[time=1783] You know what?
[time=1784] I think of some of the men in this room and some of the ladies who find themselves leading their families.
[time=1791] Those of you who are called by God to lead your family spiritually, personally, lovingly shepherd them.
[time=1800] That's a divinely appointed setting.
[time=1804] You want some land?
[time=1805] There's some land for you.
[time=1807] There is a place for you to show your love for God and your willingness to follow Him in the way you lead your home, in the level of sacrifice and the level of commitment, in the level of vigilance with which you put your arms around them and pray with them and read God's word to them and help them think through the issues of life as it relates to how they'll live in relationship to their God.
[time=1830] And I'll tell you what, you do that well or you do that poorly either way.
[time=1835] It speaks to the person of God.
[time=1838] The nations are watching.
[time=1840] The people are seeing how we function in that land.
[time=1846] Dad's mom's so important that we live faithfully, diligently with our families.
[time=1853] You're a profession, I think about you men and you women in this room who go to work each day.
[time=1859] I think about the offices that you work out of.
[time=1862] I think about the sales routes that you cover.
[time=1864] I think about the factory floor that you're on.
[time=1867] I think about the business board rooms that you find yourself moving in and out of.
[time=1873] I think about all the settings you're in.
[time=1876] As you live life in the marketplace and the opportunity God gives you each day in that land to do that in a way that is distinctively different than the way everybody else and all the nations around you, all the people who are watching.
[time=1893] There's a land, a setting for you to live out your love for God and your faith in Him.
[time=1898] Hey kids, hey kids in the room, there's a lot of you in here this morning and I mean elementary school kids.
[time=1906] I mean junior high kids, I mean high school kids.
[time=1909] I mean college, young men and women.
[time=1911] Talk about a land where you've been placed.
[time=1916] Talk about an opportunity to live out your love for God and your faith in Him.
[time=1921] Oh my goodness, your willingness and your readiness to be young people today who live with courage and who live with character and who live with a sense of purpose beyond yourself or the next high.
[time=1934] Your willingness to live and walk with integrity, your willingness to live and walk in purity.
[time=1940] Oh my goodness, what an opportunity you've been given to live in the land that God has placed you in.
[time=1945] Second thing I want you to see about the promised land this morning.
[time=1952] Number one, it's a divinely appointed setting
[time=1958] within which God has placed you.
[time=1959] Secondly, I want you to know this, the promised land, the scriptures teach us, was for the Jews a thing that we call, a thing that God's word calls their inheritance.
[time=1970] Do you write that down?
[time=1970] This was their inheritance.
[time=1973] This had been promised to them.
[time=1974] What's an inheritance?
[time=1976] Just real quickly, if you think about what's an inheritance, an inheritance is something of great value that is given not earned.
[time=1983] Jimmy and Susie got the inheritance because Dad gave it to him.
[time=1986] It wasn't that they worked for it or earned it.
[time=1988] It is given, it is of great value, and it is a gift not earned.
[time=1992] Secondly, it's something that we look forward to.
[time=1995] Israel sure did.
[time=1996] Something God had promised to provide.
[time=2000] And what's important for you to understand this morning is that not only do you have land, but you as one who has listened, as one who has fully surrendered your heart and life to Jesus Christ, you have been given a divine inheritance as well.
[time=2017] Do you know this?
[time=2019] You have been given a very large inheritance that cannot be taken away, that will not fade, will never depart from you.
[time=2031] Think about it, Israel kind of botched theirs.
[time=2034] As the story unfolds, you know they enter into the land, but the stubbornness and the iniquity and the sinfulness and the unfaithfulness doesn't stop and in God's judgment.
[time=2045] Eventually he tires of their disobedience, all of a sudden Babylon comes, these people are taken away in exile out of the land, gone.
[time=2055] And yet we read in the New Testament that in this new covenant we've been given an inheritance that is, well, let's just read.
[time=2064] Look at Ephesians if you would.
[time=2065] Go to Ephesians chapter one.
[time=2074] Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians.
[time=2078] Go to Ephesians 1, 13, let me read this for you.
[time=2080] Says in Ephesians 1, 13, "In him, my friends in Christ,
[time=2086] you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation, having also believed you were then sealed in him with the Holy Spirit of promise who was given to you, given to me, anyone who bows the knee of their heart and fully surrenders to Christ, given as a pledge." You see that, a promise, given as a pledge of our, what, say it, our inheritance with a view to the redemption of God's own possession.
[time=2121] Peter talks about it as well, turning your Bibles back to first Peter, if you will, first Peter chapter one.
[time=2128] I want you to see this.
[time=2130] Here's the confidence we have in our inheritance.
[time=2134] First Peter one, I want you to see there in verse three.
[time=2138] Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who according to his great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[time=2153] What a great picture of the great truth of the gospel.
[time=2156] To obtain, as a result of all that, verse four, to obtain a what?
[time=2161] Say it, church, an inheritance, which is imperishable and undefiled.
[time=2168] It will never nor can it ever go away and it is as pure as pure can be.
[time=2175] Imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away reserved in heaven for you.
[time=2183] I didn't add that as a third point, but if you think about it, you've got to land, you've got to land in the divinely appointed setting within which you live.
[time=2194] You have an inheritance that is yours forever.
[time=2198] That inheritance, that inheritance is eternal life with God.
[time=2202] That inheritance is the peace and the joy of being and living forever in the presence of our Lord Jesus.
[time=2210] That inheritance is that eternal blessing and it will never go away and it is always going to be there for you.
[time=2220] And then I think about heaven, there's a land.
[time=2222] So I guess in some ways you have land today and you have land tomorrow because the new Jerusalem will be established and heaven will come down and we will live and I believe we will walk and we will be in the land forever.
[time=2238] What a promise, what a hope we've been given.
[time=2242] So when I talk to you today and as you think back on our discussions about the promised land and what God desired and how that could have worked, remember you and I were right in the midst of this with a daily opportunity to live in the land that God has given us, Deuteronomy 9.
[time=2262] So now I hope this sentence makes a little bit more sense.
[time=2264] So as you make your way, you see it?
[time=2267] So as you make your way through life in the land that God has given you, number one, don't be afraid.
[time=2278] I hope you'll write that down, do not be afraid as you live out your faith and love your God in the divinely appointed setting he has you in.
[time=2291] Here we go, verses one to three, don't be afraid.
[time=2294] Hero Israel, you are crossing over the Jordan today to go in to dispossess nations.
[time=2302] Here we go, nations greater and mightier than you.
[time=2306] Great cities fortified to heaven of people, great and tall, the sons of Anakim, whom you know and of whom you have heard it said, who can stand before the sons of Anak?
[time=2321] Stop right there.
[time=2324] You remember maybe some of you, others if you may not, it's okay, I'll tell you right now, back in numbers, we see the account where they had come to the promised land and they're thinking about this fact, this is the place God had promised them.
[time=2337] So do you remember they sent in 12 spies?
[time=2340] Remember that story, they sent in spies to see what the land looked like 'cause they had heard it was flowing with milk and honey.
[time=2349] They heard it was pretty spectacular and so they sent the 12 spies in, 12 spies come back, 10 of them going, Houston, we have a problem.
[time=2360] They're like, whoa, it's filled with giants.
[time=2366] It's filled with really, really big people.
[time=2368] I mean, they're tall and they're huge and they're strong and their cities are strong and tall and huge and there isn't any way we can take them.
[time=2380] I mean, it's impossible, it's insurmountable.
[time=2385] 10 of them said that, then there was Joshua and Caleb who said, come on, let us, let us at them.
[time=2392] And yet the predominant feeling was absolute utter fear, intimidation, scared to death.
[time=2400] They were headed into a land that was scary.
[time=2406] How about you?
[time=2409] How's it going in your land today?
[time=2414] Here you go, anything scary going on?
[time=2417] Any giants to face?
[time=2422] Any difficulties, any trials, any tribulations that to you as you think about your divinely appointed setting seem to you absolutely, utterly insurmountable.
[time=2432] Well, I want you to read on here in the passage.
[time=2436] I want you to see what God says to them.
[time=2439] Know therefore today that it is the Lord your God who is crossing over before you as a consuming fire.
[time=2448] He will destroy them and he will subdue them before you so that you may drive them out and destroy them quickly just as the Lord has spoken to you.
[time=2461] Anything scary going on in your marriages?
[time=2465] Anything overwhelming happening in your family?
[time=2473] Anything at work seem impossible.
[time=2476] Who can stand before the sons of Anak?
[time=2483] Some of you in the room this morning are reeling in fear today.
[time=2488] The test results at the doctor's office came back positive.
[time=2493] That act of obedience that God is clearly calling you to pursue your convinced may cost you everything.
[time=2503] Whatever it is, I want you to know and I don't want you just to know it.
[time=2507] I want you to feel it.
[time=2510] I want you to sense it today.
[time=2512] I want you to understand that it's true and I want you to also understand that it's tangible.
[time=2519] Don't be afraid, not because you're so tough, not because you're so able, but because you have the God of heaven going before you.
[time=2533] I remember being seven, six.
[time=2537] I may have shared this with you over the years.
[time=2539] Seven, six years old, we're living in Portland, Oregon.
[time=2542] I'm just minding my own business, riding my bike.
[time=2545] That day up and down our street, I got the playing card with the clip on the back tire, flipping in the back spokes, remember that?
[time=2552] I'm just cruising down the street, minding my own business.
[time=2555] Three guys, a little bit older, a little bit bigger than me.
[time=2558] Come riding up, literally, boom, kick me, push me off my bike onto the street.
[time=2564] My dad sees the whole thing from the window of the living room.
[time=2569] I never knew my dad could run so fast.
[time=2571] I never knew my dad was so spectacular.
[time=2574] All of a sudden, boom, the front door just flies open and my dad's running down the street.
[time=2579] These kids didn't have a chance.
[time=2581] They didn't even get to the corner and he's got 'em.
[time=2584] And they're all on the, I don't think he hit anybody.
[time=2588] I don't think there was any physical contact, but I kind of caught up and they're all sitting on the grass.
[time=2594] Their bikes are laying down and my dad, his tower dad was a big man.
[time=2598] My dad's towering over these three kids.
[time=2601] And I'll never forget, I saddle on up next to my dad and I looked at these three guys.
[time=2608] You know what I mean?
[time=2611] And there was just this feeling.
[time=2613] I felt my shoulders going back and my head was about a bloody knee.
[time=2618] But I'm telling you, I stood there next to my dad as he read them the riot act and I never felt so huge, so strong, so able.
[time=2627] I wanted to just say, yeah, everything he said.
[time=2631] And then I kind of, you know, wanted to stand back behind him.
[time=2636] And that's exactly, it's exactly what I want you to sense and know to be true today.
[time=2640] He is running down the street for you.
[time=2646] He is.
[time=2648] He says, I just want you to, I just want to tell you what the Scripture's saying.
[time=2651] God goes before you like a consuming fire.
[time=2655] Do you know what a consuming fire does?
[time=2657] It, it paves away.
[time=2659] It creates a path for you to walk.
[time=2661] The enemy is subdued by a God who loves you deeply.
[time=2666] The mighty sons of Anak are absolutely nothing in the wake of God preparing a way for those who he cherishes and loves.
[time=2677] Do not, whoever you are, whatever it is you're facing in your promised land, do not be afraid.
[time=2687] Amen?
[time=2689] Courage, head up, shoulders back.
[time=2694] Not because of you, but because of him.
[time=2696] His outstretched arm, his consuming fire,
[time=2702] his never ending love.
[time=2703] Secondly, for those of you who find yourself on the banks of the river knowing it's time to go over into a land that's full of things that would scare you as you do that and as, listen, and as God provides, as God flexes his muscle that cares for you
[time=2722] and paves away for you, don't you dare get cocky.
[time=2727] Don't get arrogant.
[time=2730] Don't get prideful.
[time=2732] And I know, listen, you know and I know.
[time=2734] I've been there, you've been there.
[time=2735] There have been times where I have been so afraid.
[time=2738] Raise your hands if you've been afraid.
[time=2741] So afraid of this place that you're in and what it looks like and where it seems like it's gonna go and your utter inability to do anything, to change it and then God shows up.
[time=2752] Raise your hands if you've ever seen God show up.
[time=2755] And then it's like, boom!
[time=2757] It's like, wow, I made it.
[time=2760] He shows up, his faithfulness, evidences itself.
[time=2765] And you'd think that that would like set me on a course for like years, but I am telling you, I am so sinful at times that in hours, like days later, I can be over here like God, God, who?
[time=2780] What, no, no, I got it, I'm good.
[time=2788] I just don't need it, gonna do my own thing, gonna go where I wanna go.
[time=2793] I got it covered.
[time=2794] And Moses knows these people and he knows they are just like that.
[time=2801] He has seen their stubbornness and their forgetfulness.
[time=2804] And so he says, look at verse four, don't say in your heart then, when the Lord your God has driven them out before you, because of my righteousness, the Lord has brought me in to possess this land.
[time=2816] No, don't say that.
[time=2818] But it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is dispossessing them before you.
[time=2823] It is not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart that you are going to possess their land, but it is because of the wickedness to things.
[time=2832] It's because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord your God is driving them out before you in order to secondly confirm the oath, which the Lord swore to your fathers to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the wickedness of the people and the faithfulness of God is why you are getting this land.
[time=2849] It has nothing to do with you.
[time=2851] You are a wicked, stubborn, evil, sinful people.
[time=2855] And so for you and for me today, the message is really clear.
[time=2861] Don't you dare forget that.
[time=2864] Don't ever write this down.
[time=2868] Don't ever confuse his power to deliver for your strength to survive.
[time=2878] Yes, we are called to endure, but any human perseverance, any human endurance is only made possible by God's provision.
[time=2887] When God goes before you, please, church, don't get prideful, don't be cocky, don't get arrogant, be what, be humble, be grateful.
[time=2901] Proverbs 16, 18, if I just started out, most of you in the room can finish it, pride goes before the fall.
[time=2911] In the NASB it says, listen, pride goes before destruction.
[time=2914] And haughty, listen, and a haughty spirit, that's arrogance, that's cockiness, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.
[time=2924] Oh, you will fall, you will stumble, destruction will enter back into the picture the day you forget who's really flexing the muscle.
[time=2934] It's who?
[time=2937] I'm sorry, it's who?
[time=2939] It's God.
[time=2941] Don't forget it, I always think about, I'm kind of on a bike riding theme here, sorry.
[time=2947] I was thinking about how the first, a lot of you will identify with this, I was thinking about how the first bike ride, how the very first bike ride usually goes.
[time=2956] And it was this way with me, I know, maybe you somehow survived it, and then it was this way with several of my kids, you know how the first bike ride goes, because here's the deal, because for about two weeks, they've been out there on the street, and you've been for two weeks, you've got your hand on the back of the seat, and you've got your other hand up, kind of guiding the handlebar, and for two weeks you've been going along like this, and they've been having a blast, and for two weeks you just kind of keep going along like this, or maybe it's a couple of days, but either way they get to the point where they say, "Hey, I got it," and you say, "Are you sure?" And they say, "I got it, leave me alone," and you say, "Go get 'em," and then you go and get the peroxide and the band-aids, right?
[time=3006] Like 90% of the time, you know, "Whoa, boom!" And so just remember, it may not be a bad thing for you and I to keep in mind.
[time=3018] His hand is on the seat, he's got you, not you, and do your very best to just allow him to keep walking down that, running down that road with you as long as he will stay there, and you and I know the scriptures teach us he will stay there forever, he'll never leave you, or forsake you, let him keep his hand on the seat.
[time=3043] Let him keep his hand on the wheel.
[time=3047] Don't get cocky.
[time=3049] Last point, we gotta go.
[time=3050] Last point, I'm gonna fly through this one, I don't wanna miss it, I want you to see it here.
[time=3056] Don't be afraid, don't get cocky.
[time=3057] Remember your bent, remember people today, remember your bent what you're inclined to, what you tend to fall into, because it's the same thing Israel tended to fall into.
[time=3073] Remember your bent and be grateful for those who have saved you from it.
[time=3080] Most of you in the room understand that ultimately we believe God has saved us from our sinful bent, but I want you to just see this in the passage, how this plays out, I'm gonna read really fast, but you can keep up, this is such an amazing, amazing picture.
[time=3094] Now, verse six, now then, it is not because of your righteousness that the Lord your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stubborn people, there's your bent.
[time=3104] Remember, do not forget how you provoked the Lord your God, there's your bent to wrath and the wilderness, from the day you left the land of Egypt until you arrived at this place, you have been rebellious against the Lord, there's your bent, your bent to stubbornness, your bent is to provoke God, your bent is rebellion, even at Orib, you provoked the Lord to wrath, and the Lord was so angry with you that he would have destroyed you.
[time=3132] When I went up to the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which the Lord had made with you, then I remained on the mountain 40 days and nights, I neither ate bread nor drank water, the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone written by the finger of God, and on them were all the words which the Lord had spoken with you at the mountain, from the midst of the fire, on the day of assembly, it came about at the end of 40 days and nights, the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant, then the Lord said to me arise, go down from here quickly for here people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted correctly, there's our bent, they have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them, they have made a molten image, the calf, remember, they have made a molten image for themselves, the Lord spoke further to me saying, and this is really fascinating, well listen to this, God says to Moses, let me alone, I just find that interesting,
[time=3199] God said to Moses, let me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven, and I will make of you, a nation mightier and greater than they, well let me ask you, if you're Moses right there, what do you do?
[time=3215] God's saying, you know what dude, I'm with you, and I wanna just wipe these fools out and we're gonna start all over, I'm gonna make you a great nation, full of people who will do it right, what do you say, they're bent toward rebellion, they're bent toward sinfulness, they're bent toward provoking me, and they've done it from the day they left.
[time=3235] If I'm Moses, I'm just thinking about it, I'm just saying, but not him, look at him.
[time=3246] So I turned and came down from the mountain while the mountain was burning with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands, and I saw that you had indeed sinned against the Lord, your God, you had made for yourself a molten calf, you had turned aside quickly from the way which the Lord had commanded you, I took hold of the two tablets, I threw them from my hands and smashed them before your eyes, I fell down before the Lord at the first 40 days and nights, I neither ate bread nor drank water because of all your sin which you had committed in doing what was evil on the side of the Lord to provoke him to anger, for I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the Lord was wrathful against you in order to destroy you, but the Lord listened to me that time also, the Lord was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, so I prayed for Aaron at the same time, I took your sinful thing, I love that, I took your sinful thing, the calf, would you be willing to do this with your sinful thing?
[time=3309] What's your sinful thing?
[time=3313] Look what Moses does to their sinful thing, the calf which you made and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it very small until it was as fine as dust and I threw its dust into the brook that came down from the mountain.
[time=3332] Again at Tabara and at Massah and at Kibrath Hatavah you provoked the Lord to wrath when the Lord sent you from Kadesh Burna saying, "Go up and possess the land which I've given you," then you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God, you neither believed him nor listened to his voice, you have been rebellious against the Lord from the day, I knew you so I fell down before the Lord, the 40 days and nights, so I'm gonna stop right there and here's the point, the point is this.
[time=3359] Wow, he just, he has a chance to throw them under the bus and what he does is he gets on his face, what he does is he begs God for them, what he does is he fasts and prays again, what he does is he faithfully, lovingly begs God to give them another chance and it makes me grateful
[time=3386] for the people in my life who have done the exact same thing and it should make you grateful for those leaders and those pastors and those friends and those family members who had every reason to turn their back and they've just said, you know what?
[time=3402] Oh God, please, let me keep trying, let me keep doing my best to encourage, oh God, please save, hold off your wrath.
[time=3415] Your bent and mine leave us in this place where again and again we should suffer the wrath of God and yet God is faithful, he is long-suffering and there are people in your life and mine who continue to stand in the gap, praise God for them, you may be one of those, how you doing with your kids as they struggle through or wander through, how are you doing with a friend who has let you down again?
[time=3446] Oh may God give us the strength and the courage and the love of Moses to walk alongside those who we love and beg God for more opportunities to shepherd, love and guide, will you stand?
[time=3459] Our Father in Heaven, we're grateful for the picture here from Deuteronomy 9, God, every one of us knows that we really do have a land and an inheritance and God as we enter into our land this week, God, I pray that you would go before us, you and your consuming fire, keep us humble, keep us absolutely and utterly dependent on you, we pray and all the people agreed and said, amen, God bless you, we'll see you next week.
[time=3490] (upbeat music)
