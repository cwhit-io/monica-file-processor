[time=73] - Well, hello again and good morning.
[time=78] Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=80] It is good to be with you again and great to have these few moments.
[time=83] As most of you are watching this, it's Sunday morning, December 4th.
[time=88] Others of you may be catching it later in the week, but either way, I want you to know that I understand and we understand here at Black Hawk that we enter into a month here that is a really special month and it's a month filled with the great celebration of Christmas, but it's also a month where a lot of people and you may be one of these people, a lot of people have to face some of the struggles of their life, some of the difficulties of their past.
[time=117] This is a time of year where hardship comes and oftentimes people struggle with loneliness and discouragement and depression.
[time=126] And I want you to know, we want you to know that Black Hawk is a place and this is a family and our gatherings on Sunday mornings are events where you can come and find hope, where you can come and find a friendly hand, a friendly face where people would love nothing more than to greet you and welcome you into this family, especially during the month of December as we gather each Sunday now throughout December to engage in what we call Christmas with Black Hawk.
[time=158] It is a great opportunity for us to, through the arts and the gifted people that God has given us and this family as a whole, we get to lift up and song and music and drama, the great story of Christmas.
[time=171] And I would love to just extend a personal invitation to you.
[time=175] Whoever you are, however old you might be, whatever your circumstance in life, we'd love for you to come and be a part of it.
[time=182] Nine and 1045 on Sunday mornings through the month of December, a personal invitation to you.
[time=188] Come and celebrate Christmas with us.
[time=191] Come and have your heart and your soul and your life encouraged as we look to the one source of encouragement.
[time=199] The Lord Jesus Christ whose birth we celebrate this month.
[time=202] God bless you.
[time=203] I hope you have a great rest of your week.
[time=205] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=207] [MUSIC - 469 seconds]
[time=684] [MUSIC] You make me new [MUSIC] You are making me new [MUSIC] You make me new [MUSIC] You are making me new [MUSIC] You make beautiful things [MUSIC] You make beautiful things out of the dust [MUSIC] You make beautiful things [MUSIC] You make beautiful things out of the dust [MUSIC] You make me new [MUSIC] You make beautiful things [MUSIC] You make beautiful things out of the dust [MUSIC] You make beautiful things [MUSIC] You make beautiful things [MUSIC] You make beautiful things out of the dust [MUSIC]
[time=798] Hey, turning your Bibles.
[time=799] If you would this morning, the Deuteronomy chapter 10 and 11, we come to the end of not Deuteronomy, but our little mini study of the middle section, if you will, kind of Deuteronomy.
[time=812] We have entitled our series, "Your Best Life Now." And the gist of it, my friends, has basically been this.
[time=820] If you want to live a life, if you want to experience a life, if you want to see a life that's filled with all the things that God designed for you to experience, if you want to see and know your best life now,
[time=837] the way you do that, according to the Word of God, that happens.
[time=842] You experience that when you love and obey God.
[time=846] God designed you, God designed your life, God has prescribed for you and for me the way in which he wants us to live, and there is great blessing, and there is great promise, and there is great hope, and you and I get to experience all of those things that best life we could ever know when we live it each and every day with him.
[time=870] This is the message that he has had.
[time=873] Chapter after chapter line after line for these people, his people, the nation of Israel, he loved them.
[time=880] They were dear and precious to him, and as they're camped out on the plains of Moab, getting ready to cross over the Jordan into the promised land.
[time=891] Comes here in chapter 10 and 11 and gives them even more truth, even more principles to hold on to grasp and to live by.
[time=901] And I want to show you some of those things here today.
[time=903] As chapter 10 starts, I'll just tell you this and then we're going to get into the bulk of what I want to communicate with you this morning once we get to verse 12.
[time=915] But in the first 11 verses of chapter 10, I just want you to know we've got new tablets, we've got a new ark and we've got new priests.
[time=926] What happens is God says, hey, come on back up to the mountain.
[time=929] Come on back up here and let's do this again.
[time=932] And God rewrites the Ten Commandments.
[time=935] He says to Moses, cut out two new stones and while you're at it, make an ark of acacia wood.
[time=942] And Noah there constructs the ark of the covenant that the tablets will rest in.
[time=948] He says, come on back up to the mountain.
[time=950] God writes with his finger as it was, the Ten Commandments, the tablets get put into the ark.
[time=957] And then right there in 9, 8, 9, and 10, he talks about the Levites.
[time=962] This is where God designates the tribe of Levi.
[time=966] The Levites would be the ones who would now function as the priests.
[time=971] The Levites would be the ones who would now function as worship leaders, if you will, of the people of Israel.
[time=977] So you've got new tablets and new ark, new priests.
[time=980] And God says to Moses, God in essence says to the people of Israel, what he says to you and what he says to me again and again and again, thank God he does.
[time=990] He says, let's try this again.
[time=993] New ark, new tablets, new priests.
[time=998] And we're gonna try this again and how grateful I am for God's willingness to continue to try it again with me.
[time=1006] Now we come to verse 12.
[time=1009] And let me just say this before we get to verse 12.
[time=1013] I love it personally.
[time=1015] Now I'm just telling you about me.
[time=1016] Maybe you're like this as well, but I really, really like it when things that are confusing.
[time=1023] I love it when things that are difficult.
[time=1026] I love it when things that are challenging all of a sudden over time get clear.
[time=1033] I love, I love clarity.
[time=1035] I really do.
[time=1036] I love, I love the end of a crossword puzzle.
[time=1039] I love it when all that kind of comes together and finally after wrestling with it as long as maybe you wrestled with it or I wrestled with it, it becomes clear.
[time=1049] I love the unbelievable, never saw it coming end to a movie
[time=1056] or book that's just captivated me for two hours or two weeks, whatever it might have been.
[time=1063] You've been there, I've been there that oh my goodness, I never saw it coming, but now it makes what?
[time=1069] Now it makes sense.
[time=1071] I love sitting on the beach.
[time=1072] Could be anywhere, Florida, Southern California, Lake Michigan.
[time=1077] I love watching the morning fog and clouds start to roll away slowly unveiling the bright clarity of a sunny new day.
[time=1086] I love it when things get clear.
[time=1088] I love those tough talks that you have with those that you love
[time=1094] that allow for the relationship to finally get back on track, relational clarity.
[time=1101] You know what I love?
[time=1102] I love it when leaders step into difficult situations.
[time=1107] I love it when leaders step into chaos and confusion and say, okay, okay, sleeves rolled up, listen up.
[time=1115] Here's what we're going to do.
[time=1117] I love it when leaders step in and help people on teams and help people in organizations understand those basic principles
[time=1126] that they cannot lose sight of.
[time=1129] Raise your hand here in the room this morning if you appreciate clarity.
[time=1132] Yeah, most of us, most of us do.
[time=1135] Okay, so here's the deal.
[time=1136] What God does right here in Deuteronomy 10, 12, and 13 is just like that.
[time=1142] He takes the, he takes the whole, he takes the big, complex,
[time=1148] the whole ball game of following and honoring God.
[time=1154] And he whittles it down to four very clear, four very unambiguous, four very understandable principles.
[time=1165] And I like that.
[time=1166] I like it when the big, whole, complex thing gets really,
[time=1172] really simple.
[time=1174] Now, I do ministry every week with a staff.
[time=1178] It's a whole lot younger than I am.
[time=1180] I hear from my staff all the time how I'm supposed to embrace the mystery of God and how I should kind of like it when things don't make sense and I should embrace stuff that's confusing about God.
[time=1195] There's this tension about him and I hear them.
[time=1197] Tell me that and I believe them.
[time=1200] They've been good for me.
[time=1201] And I'm going to keep trying to embrace the mysteries of God and the tensions that don't make sense and the challenges that I encounter, but I'm just saying I'm almost 50 and the older I get, the more I like simple clarity.
[time=1215] Can I hear a name in?
[time=1217] All right, so I'm going to keep embracing the mystery.
[time=1219] I promise you, but when I read, when I come to Deuteronomy 10, 12, and I read now Israel, what does the Lord your God require from you, which translated really means now Israel, this is what the Lord your God requires from you.
[time=1245] When I read that my heart leaps, when I read that my eyes perk up, when I read that I realized he's about to get really, really, what, clear.
[time=1256] And I love, I love clarity.
[time=1258] And then he rolls out, he rolls out with four really important summary truths
[time=1264] that Israel and you and me should never lose sight of.
[time=1271] And truthfully, as you read the rest of Deuteronomy and I told first hour and I got a great response from them, I told them you should.
[time=1277] We're going to move into Christmas.
[time=1279] We're going to move into December in the Sundays that come.
[time=1282] You should keep reading Deuteronomy.
[time=1284] Oh my goodness, what a story.
[time=1287] Page after page after page of God continuing to prepare his people.
[time=1292] And I'm telling you again and again and again, page after page after page, you will see, you will hear these four principles.
[time=1304] He comes back to them again and again and again.
[time=1308] These four principles, my friends, you should memorize them.
[time=1314] You should teach these four principles to your kids.
[time=1319] You should talk to your children young and old about them as often as you can.
[time=1325] You should live your life by these four principles.
[time=1328] You should frame these four principles.
[time=1332] You should make screen savers of these four principles.
[time=1336] You should put them next to your bed.
[time=1337] They should be in your bathroom.
[time=1339] They should be in your car somehow.
[time=1341] Some way you should inundate your life with these four truths that we'll look at this morning.
[time=1348] Most importantly, most importantly, you should embed them in the depths of your heart.
[time=1356] And those aren't my words.
[time=1358] Those are his.
[time=1359] Let me read it to you.
[time=1360] Would you stand in honor of God's Word and let me read to you this morning?
[time=1365] Deuteronomy 10, verses 12 to 16.
[time=1369] Now Israel, what does the Lord your God require from you
[time=1375] but to fear the Lord your God?
[time=1379] To walk in all his ways and love him.
[time=1384] To serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
[time=1388] And to keep the Lord's commandments and his statutes, which I am commanding you today for your good.
[time=1397] Behold to the Lord your God, Belong heaven and the highest heavens, the earth and all that is in it.
[time=1404] Yet on your fathers, did the Lord set his affection to love them and he chose their descendants after them even you above all peoples as it is this day.
[time=1414] Here you go.
[time=1415] So circumcise your heart.
[time=1420] So circumcise your heart and stiffen your neck no longer.
[time=1428] Our Father in heaven this morning, we stand before you like these people of yours
[time=1436] on the plains of Moab stood before you.
[time=1438] And God we would confess that there are times when our hearts have not been
[time=1445] devoted, dedicated, consecrated, set apart to you.
[time=1452] God there are times when our necks are stiff with rebellion and independence.
[time=1459] And oh God we want to understand what you had in your heart and mind for your people as they entered into their land.
[time=1466] God as we live in our land today, may we understand and see clearly
[time=1472] the great importance of these principles we're about to study.
[time=1476] Oh God may these principles make their way into our marriages and into our parenting and into our stewarding of resources and into our ministries.
[time=1488] God may these truths today, these simple clear truths.
[time=1494] May they change us and grow us in our relationship and walk with you.
[time=1499] Father thank you and we mean that.
[time=1501] Thank you for the privilege of meeting today so freely.
[time=1506] Thank you for the fact that we live in a place.
[time=1508] We live in a land where we're able to come into this room and worship you and read and study your word God for those dear brothers and sisters who right now this very moment in places far far away live in fear of their lives
[time=1525] as they try their best to honor and follow you.
[time=1527] May you give them great courage and may we never ever forget the way in which they live,
[time=1534] the courage that they show.
[time=1536] Thank you God for the privilege of what we get to do here.
[time=1540] May you bless this time in your son's name.
[time=1542] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=1545] I tell you what, if you're a brand new follower of Christ and there are many in the room today, I know you need these four principles, my friends.
[time=1553] If you've been walking with God for 30, 40, 50 years, you need these four principles and just saying that 30, 40, 50 years, I'm reminded of our dear, dear friend, Raina.
[time=1565] Lastly, she passed away this week.
[time=1568] Oscar and Raina been a part of our church for years.
[time=1571] They've served here for years, Oscar's still a functioning greeter.
[time=1575] And Oscar and Raina were married for 70 years and she went to be with the Lord.
[time=1581] Late this past week, we'll remember and celebrate her life Monday,
[time=1587] Monday morning coming up tomorrow.
[time=1589] But whoever you are, however long you've been at this, whatever circumstance you are in today, I'm telling you, you need these four principles.
[time=1600] Most all of them, I think you've heard before, we've heard them already in our study and yet he comes back and he just in crystal clear fashion,
[time=1611] says, "Hey, you better hang on to these right here." So let's jump in.
[time=1617] Principle number one, you see it right there in the text in verse 12.
[time=1620] Now, Israel, what does the Lord require from you but to fear the Lord your God?
[time=1630] God requires, my friends, that you would in your efforts to follow and honor him
[time=1637] and have the life that God intended you to have in order to experience that.
[time=1643] He says, "You better start with a very healthy, very real fear of the Lord."
[time=1650] We've talked about this in recent weeks.
[time=1652] I'm not going to go in depth on this but I do want to take you to a couple of places and make sure we're on the same page here.
[time=1658] Go to Proverbs, would you?
[time=1661] Go to Proverbs chapter 10.
[time=1664] Proverbs chapter 10, look at verse 27.
[time=1668] It says here, a theme that we've heard in recent weeks, "The fear of the Lord prolongs life."
[time=1676] The fear of the Lord prolongs life but the years of the wicked will be shortened.
[time=1682] Here we see the blessing of life coming to those who live with a healthy fear
[time=1688] of God, "The fear of the Lord prolongs life." Go over to Proverbs 14, if you will, 1426.
[time=1697] Yeah, just flip over a few pages, Proverbs 1426, I love this.
[time=1702] Here we find the great tension.
[time=1704] Here we find, talk about a mystery, listen to this, "In the fear of the Lord,
[time=1710] there is strong," what?
[time=1711] Say it, church.
[time=1713] Confidence.
[time=1714] "In the fear of the Lord, there is strong confidence, and in the fear of the Lord, His children will have refuge." Refuge is a place of comfort.
[time=1725] Refuge is a place where you go when you're scared and yet hear the fear of the Lord.
[time=1733] Fearing God provides for you and me with God a place of refuge.
[time=1740] It might not make sense like right here, but you've got to consider this truth.
[time=1746] You've got to wrestle with this.
[time=1748] There is this great tension as we experience this great truth lived out in our life.
[time=1754] The fear, look at 27, "The fear of the Lord," the fear of the Lord is a fountain.
[time=1760] It's a fountain of life that one may avoid the snares of death.
[time=1768] Fear of the Lord, a refuge, a fountain, avoiding the snares of death.
[time=1776] Go over to 19, Proverbs, chapter 19.
[time=1779] I want you to look at verse 23.
[time=1783] What a great truth.
[time=1784] The fear of the Lord, there it is.
[time=1787] I love the picture that gets painted here.
[time=1789] "The fear of the Lord leads to life so that one one who fears the Lord may sleep."
[time=1796] What satisfied, untouched by evil.
[time=1802] Fear of the Lord leads to the ability for you and I to sleep well, untouched by evil.
[time=1810] I hope you'll just write this down, my friends.
[time=1813] Live in fearful awe of a loving God who is also judge.
[time=1821] Yes, God is love.
[time=1823] Yes, God is grace.
[time=1824] Yes, God is mercy.
[time=1826] Do not neglect what a terrible position we put ourselves in when we neglect the fact
[time=1832] that he is also judge.
[time=1835] He is judge.
[time=1836] He is judge of sin.
[time=1839] He can't stand it.
[time=1840] He hates it.
[time=1841] He deals with it in his time.
[time=1844] He will not let it go.
[time=1846] He will not overlook it in a sense.
[time=1849] He is awfully gracious with you and he is awfully merciful with me.
[time=1853] And there are times where it seems as if he does, there's the tension.
[time=1857] The fact is you and I should view him.
[time=1860] You and I should live in relationship with him with this healthy sense of fearful awe and the fact that he is both loving and judge.
[time=1872] I wrote this down and I just believe with all my heart, fearing God leads us away.
[time=1877] Hitting God leads us away from sin.
[time=1887] We live out of ways and on our road where we live, pretty close to us, just down the
[time=1899] way a bit is a house with an owner who is not real kind.
[time=1912] And there have been some things that have happened.
[time=1917] There have been some encounters mostly with my kids, one with me, that was all it took.
[time=1929] And it's just not a good situation.
[time=1933] And we've tried and we're going to keep trying and we hope it's not over, but today, right
[time=1940] now, not so good.
[time=1943] Somebody first hour said, "Aren't you a little nervous talking about it?" He watches the Bible hour, no.
[time=1950] I don't think he does.
[time=1951] If he does, maybe he can just hear me say how much we love him and we hope this can get better someday.
[time=1956] But here's the deal.
[time=1957] I'm just telling you, it's been about four or five years.
[time=1959] Today, right now, you walk down our road with any of our kids.
[time=1966] They can be in a conversation going 100 miles an hour and the minute we get in front of that house, they're quiet.
[time=1973] They look the other way, they walk over onto the other side of the street.
[time=1977] They don't want anything to do with that line, that yard, that blade of grass.
[time=1985] They will never, as long as they live, for the rest of their lives will they ever go near it.
[time=1991] You with me?
[time=1994] Because they know that's not going to go well.
[time=2000] You're afraid and you say, "Oh, it's a bad illustration." You don't want people thinking of God that way.
[time=2011] I want you thinking this way.
[time=2015] I want you to know that if somehow you choose to live life, not fearing what will happen
[time=2022] if you do not honor him, if you choose to live life in a way whereby you blow right
[time=2029] by this signpost, I want you to understand.
[time=2035] I want you to just to consider how bad it will be.
[time=2040] So I'm okay.
[time=2041] I understand that he is love and he is grace and he is mercy.
[time=2046] But when you toy with sin, when you blow by the fear of God and the fear of what happens
[time=2052] when you disobey difficult, hard, life-changing things happen, fear, healthy.
[time=2059] Fear leads us away from sin.
[time=2065] Fear the Lord your God.
[time=2066] Walk in all his ways.
[time=2067] Second principle.
[time=2068] Oh, I hope you'll write these down.
[time=2069] I hope you'll commit these to memory.
[time=2071] I hope you'll talk to your kids and your spouse and your friends about these.
[time=2076] Walk and you want to honor God?
[time=2077] You want to follow God?
[time=2078] God takes all of that.
[time=2079] He whittles it down to this great principle.
[time=2082] Walk in his ways.
[time=2085] In other words, obey.
[time=2087] Walk in his ways.
[time=2088] I put a picture up on the screen for us this morning and I had him put this picture because I just want you to kind of, if you can visually, I think most of you can do this visually.
[time=2097] I want you to see that path.
[time=2099] I want you to see that walkway there and I want you to understand that just over that fence and you can tell by the picture, just over that fence, it drops really far, really
[time=2112] fast a long, long way down.
[time=2117] You get off that path that way and it's over.
[time=2122] Do you understand that?
[time=2124] So now having seen that and visually, I think we're on the same page now, I just want you to understand that that pathway right there, that's moral purity.
[time=2136] That's marriage.
[time=2139] That's how you spend your resources.
[time=2143] That pathway right there and that cliff and that valley down there where if you get off
[time=2149] that path and fall you die, that's purity, that's marriage, that's parenting, that's
[time=2155] how you use your resources, that speech, I mean these, that path represents the commandments
[time=2162] of God to you in the situations and circumstances that God has uniquely set you in.
[time=2169] And when you obey him, when you walk in his way, you will walk along that path and you
[time=2178] will experience all that God has designed for you.
[time=2181] And if you get off that path, it will not go well.
[time=2189] It does not go well.
[time=2193] I had him put that verse up there, it's just a great reminder, trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding, your own, you feel like doing this, you think
[time=2207] you should do that.
[time=2209] This looks like it'll be, do not lean on your own understanding in all of your ways, acknowledge
[time=2216] him, walk in all his ways and he will make your path, what, straight, and he will make
[time=2228] your paths straight, obey him, obey him in marriage, obey him in purity, obey him in
[time=2237] the way you parent, obey him with your money, obey him with your speech, walk in all his
[time=2245] ways, fear the Lord your God, walk in all his ways, love, love him, love him, I know this
[time=2254] sounds simple, I know it sounds very basic, but oh, it is so profoundly important, who
[time=2262] listen, who you it is so profoundly important, who you love, who you love, I want you to
[time=2272] think about that with me, who do you love, see we get in trouble on this one, you and
[time=2279] me, you and me and the nation of Israel, we get in trouble on this one because we tend
[time=2287] to love, we tend to love, listen, we tend to love the tangible, right, we tend to love
[time=2296] the tangible, the Israelites loved a gold calf, the Israelites loved in time they left God
[time=2303] for Asherapoles where disgusting, despicable, unspeakable stuff took place in pagan temples,
[time=2312] the Israelites loved foreign women and men that God told them not to love or if they
[time=2318] did love them, he said they will make your hearts stray, see, Israel and you and me,
[time=2326] we tend to move away from God and we tend to move toward the tangible, the stuff we can
[time=2332] touch, the stuff we can feel, we have affection for, listen, we have affection for, we make
[time=2340] sacrifices for, I'm describing love, we go out of our way for pleasure, possessions and
[time=2348] people, pleasure, 15 minutes on the internet, we tend to love pleasure, found in all kinds
[time=2368] of different settings, all kinds of different ways, cheap, not lasting, futile, empty,
[time=2380] but oh, oh we love it, we sacrifice for it, we go out of our way for it, pleasure, possessions
[time=2398] oh, some are bent in that direction, buying things or attempting to buy things you have
[time=2408] no business buying, living outside our means, I've struggled with that, many of you in the
[time=2417] room have struggled with that, we love running something up on a card, we love feeling like
[time=2427] we can actually have what we really truly shouldn't, it can be a, it can be a purchase
[time=2435] at the mall, it can be a home, it can be a car, it can be a vacation, but there is this
[time=2441] thing in us that leads us to love, getting and having, possessing stuff and two things
[time=2450] there, at the end of the day the stuff doesn't work, it doesn't fulfill anything deeply in
[time=2456] us that it all, we all kind of thought maybe it would and then secondly it leaves us extended,
[time=2462] overextended, struggling, can God make that right, can God make fifteen minutes on a computer
[time=2471] right, yep, can God make being overextended right, absolutely, he can, praise God, but
[time=2480] we love, we love pleasure, we love possessions, we love people, maybe it's not a credit
[time=2490] card, maybe it's not fifteen minutes on the internet, maybe it's that girlfriend, that
[time=2497] boyfriend, that husband, that wife, anybody that you throw all your hope into, anybody
[time=2506] you throw all your identity into, anybody you throw all of you into, you say, wait a
[time=2512] minute, I thought I was supposed to throw all me into those I love, no, you're supposed to throw all of you into God who then gives you the strength and ability to love out of
[time=2523] your relationship with him, so I just, I want to remind you that this can go well, it really
[time=2530] can when you fear the Lord your God, when you walk in all his ways and when you love him, more than I pray, I pray it almost every night, not every, almost every night whether
[time=2545] it's when we're together there in the living room or maybe it's just individually with a kid at his or her bedside, it may be when they're awake, sometimes it's when they're asleep but almost every night, I pray for my kids that they will as they grow never ever
[time=2563] love anything or anyone more than they love God.
[time=2569] And I know now looking back, I understand what happens when you love something or someone
[time=2576] else more than him and so I pray it for them and I pray it for you and I hope you'll hang on to that thought this morning, love him above all else and then fourthly serve the
[time=2587] Lord your God, walk in all his ways and love him and to serve the Lord your God with all
[time=2593] your heart and with all your soul.
[time=2596] What does this mean, my friends?
[time=2599] What do we mean when we say here, what does God mean, what's Moses saying here when he says to them and when I say to you, you want to follow and honor God here, it gets whittled down into these principles and here's one for you, serve the Lord your God.
[time=2615] What does that mean, is that what I'm doing right here, am I serving, am I serving the
[time=2624] Lord right here doing what I'm doing this morning, is serving the Lord your God helping with six-year-olds down the hall?
[time=2632] What does it mean when it says serve the Lord your God?
[time=2636] You know what?
[time=2637] We could have a great discussion, not enough time so I'll just tell you this, serving in children's ministries is certainly under the umbrella of serving the Lord your God.
[time=2648] Me exercising my gift here, trying to exercise my gift of leadership and teaching.
[time=2654] You exercising the spiritual gifts that God's given you, certainly under the banner of serve
[time=2660] the Lord your God.
[time=2661] But let me just give you the, let me give you kind of the bigger bullet point on that one.
[time=2666] When it says here, serve the Lord your God, what he's really getting to is your place, listen, your fundamental place, your fundamental direction of allegiance.
[time=2676] He's talking about who's beck and call do you respond to?
[time=2686] Who do you show allegiance to ultimately?
[time=2691] Who or what are you most devoted to, most committed to?
[time=2697] It was unbelievable, this illustration falls very short of the divine picture we're speaking
[time=2704] of but I just, I got to tell you, devotion, allegiance, commitment, wow, sitting on that,
[time=2713] some of you know, Deborah and I, my wife and our two oldest daughters, Wesley and Maddie, we got to be on the aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, a couple of weeks ago when
[time=2724] our son Russell and the Michigan State Spartans played the University of North Carolina, Tar Heels, right there on the flight deck, it was an incredible experience.
[time=2734] The aesthetics of it was just San Diego and sunset and on that ship, unbelievable, being
[time=2740] on a ship there in a 7,000 seat arena with thousands, thousands of sailors, most of them
[time=2746] from the USS Carl Vinson, we sat with many of them, got to know them.
[time=2753] It was pandemonium at the beginning, just thousands of people coming in, there's music playing, there's people talking, there's teens warming up, there's television stuff going on.
[time=2764] But I got to tell you, when the PA guy comes on the loudspeaker system and says, ladies
[time=2770] and gentlemen, the President of the United States of America, politics aside, it makes
[time=2780] the hair on the back of your neck stand up when thousands of sailors, just in a heartbeat,
[time=2788] that attention, because there is allegiance there to a commander in chief who they don't
[time=2794] always understand, who they don't always agree with, we know, we sat with six of them.
[time=2805] But I'll tell you what, those six, man, it was just this sense of, you're the man.
[time=2816] And I wonder, who's the man in your life?
[time=2823] Who evokes that kind of beck and call allegiance where when he or it speaks, you go.
[time=2833] This is serving the Lord your God, that level of commitment and devotion and allegiance.
[time=2841] All right, we're going to go, but I want to just tell you this, Samson, Samson didn't
[time=2847] do that well, Samson served the Lila, Samson served pleasure, Samson served gain, Samson
[time=2856] great example of how not to do that.
[time=2859] Joshua, Joseph, think about it, go home tonight, think about examples in the Bible where you see really clear evidence of folks who serve the Lord, fear the Lord, walk in his ways.
[time=2872] It's a great, great opportunity for you.
[time=2876] Now look at Deuteronomy 11, 26.
[time=2879] Corbin, you guys can come up, I'm going to just read this and then we're going to go, see I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse Deuteronomy 11, 26 and 27.
[time=2890] The blessing if you listen to the commandments of the Lord your God which I am commanding you today and the curse if you do not listen to the commandments of the Lord your God.
[time=2900] You see that?
[time=2901] We come to 11 and God gets really, really pragmatic here.
[time=2908] And I know we could go a number of different directions talking about the theological implications
[time=2914] of this kind of writing, this kind of thinking.
[time=2917] Is it really always a one for one if you do what's right, you get what's good, if you do what's wrong, you get what's bad, are we like these puppets, no it's not like that.
[time=2926] But I want to just, I want to tell you from a, I've been closely watching God and his interactions
[time=2932] with people for almost 30 years perspective.
[time=2934] I just want to tell you, blessing, blessing comes with obedience.
[time=2940] Blessing comes with obedience, a curse, discipline, a lack of blessing comes with disobedience.
[time=2953] And I want you to understand this while blessing can at times, while blessing can at times
[time=2959] be connotated with circumstantial stuff, oh please understand that blessing isn't just
[time=2968] circumstantial.
[time=2969] See I've had people come to me and say that doesn't make any sense.
[time=2972] You say if I obey God and honor God and follow God, I'll be blessed.
[time=2976] But I know they'll say I know people who obey God and honor God and follow God and they got cancer and died.
[time=2983] And see that's where you have to be careful, you have to be careful.
[time=2988] Blessing, blessing is joy, the joy that you receive in relationship with him as you follow
[time=2995] and honor him, blessing is the peace that you get to experience in relationship with him.
[time=3000] Blessing, blessing is the security that you have now and forever.
[time=3005] See blessing isn't just a benign tumor.
[time=3010] Now the, I know people who have laid in hospital beds with malignant tumors dying, filled, blessed beyond belief, filled with joy, filled with peace.
[time=3019] And I know people who don't have cancer, who are, who are cancer free if you will, living in disobedience filled with emptiness, sorrow, grief, regret and remorse.
[time=3030] Follow him, follow him and there is blessing, blessing beyond belief.
[time=3036] Father in heaven, what an amazing truth that we get to think about today and, and again who are we, it's amazing that you love us so much.
[time=3045] It's amazing that you care for us so much that you would go to such links as you did with your people, the Israelites and the way that you do with us even here today.
[time=3057] You go to such great links to help us see and understand what you desire and long for
[time=3063] in our relationship with you.
[time=3065] Oh God, we just pause now at the end here to be grateful for that.
[time=3071] We pause now to worship you, one who is above all else and yet you stoop to care for, engage
[time=3079] yourself in and walk alongside those of us in the everyday of life.
[time=3085] Oh God, may we with great courage respond to these truths today.
[time=3090] May we follow you with great obedience and faithfulness.
[time=3095] Oh God, hear our voices and hear our hearts today.
[time=3097] How grateful we are to be your people, your people for your own possession.
[time=3103] How blessed we are in your son's name we pray, Amen.
[time=3110] Oh, this pain, I wonder if I'll ever find my way, I wonder if my life could really change
[time=3131] at all.
[time=3137] Oh, this earth could all that has lost ever be found.
[time=3148] Could a garden come up from this ground at all?
[time=3158] And you made beautiful things, you made beautiful things out of the dust, you made beautiful
[time=3177] things out of us.
[time=3189] Oh, oh God, hope is springing up from this old ground, out of chaos, life is being found
[time=3204] in you.
[time=3209] For you made beautiful things, you made beautiful things out of the dust, you made beautiful
[time=3226] things, you made beautiful things out of us, you made beautiful things out of the dust,
[time=3246] you made beautiful things, you made beautiful things out of us.
[time=3262] You made me new, you are making me new.
[time=3290] You made me new, you are making me new, making me new, you made beautiful things, you made
[time=3310] me new, you made beautiful things, you made beautiful things out of the dust, you made
[time=3372] Hey man, would you stand with me this morning, I want to just as we leave today, in your
[time=3380] bulletin you got a postcard, everybody in the room, please hang on to this, this is
[time=3386] really not only for you but it's a way for you to invite and we're going to make these available all through the month of December because in January we're going to take three weeks and deal with, look at, from the scriptures an issue that isn't a new issue.
[time=3401] Families struggled from the day Cain and Abel went at it.
[time=3409] Families have been, what do you want to say, dysfunctional, God has a design for the family, we've been bucking against that from day one.
[time=3418] And today families, yours in mind, those who you live near, those who you work with, families
[time=3426] are at risk, today we live in a culture where the attack against family from the enemy is
[time=3432] as severe as it's ever been.
[time=3435] So we're going to take three weeks in January, we're going to talk about it, we're going to announce it, we're going to invite people to it all through December and I hope you'll join us.
[time=3443] Making marriage better, week one, making marriage better, week two, parenting 101, we're trying
[time=3449] to raise happy kids or holy, kids, week three, spiritual leadership in the home, how can
[time=3457] we go about that in a way whereby it's called cultivating a sticky faith, Jesse Hannah did
[time=3464] a whole growth group five week series on it, it was phenomenal, we're going to use Jesse and some of that teaching to help us think about how to cultivate in our kids a faith that they actually embrace and hold on to even beyond their years at home.
[time=3479] So wow, what an important three weeks, I hope you'll pray for us, I hope you'll use these to invite friends, God bless you, good to be together today, thank you for being here, we'll see you next week.
