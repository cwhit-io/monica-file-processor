[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=61] Well, this morning before we begin our one act drama, there are a couple of things that I wanted you all to know about it.
[time=68] It's called God with us the life of David Flood, and David Flood is a real person that lived about 100 years ago.
[time=76] And I had the privilege of reading a book about him over the summer and learned some pretty fascinating things about this missionary gone bad.
[time=84] I was fascinated, as I read about David Flood, the way that God pursued him relentlessly, even though David had turned his back on God for decades.
[time=94] The other characters in the drama are also based on actual events, although as you'll see, there's a lot of fiction woven into.
[time=102] It is well, so hopefully you can distinguish between the two.
[time=106] So without delaying it any longer, I'm excited to show you what these 15 actors and actresses have been working on for the last four weeks as they present to you today.
[time=114] God with us the life of David Flood.
[time=118] [MUSIC]
[time=128] It's beginning to look a lot like.
[time=132] [LAUGHTER] Oh, Judith, you were right. That film was even better than you described.
[time=139] Oh, Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, and my two best friend.
[time=143] [LAUGHTER] I can't imagine a better way to spend an evening.
[time=147] I could watch that movie every Christmas. I can't believe you've never seen Holiday in before Aggie.
[time=151] You know how hard it is for her to stay up with things, being so busy, married to that professor and taking care of all those, wait, how many children do you have?
[time=160] Oh, Judy, stop it. Just because Leo and I haven't had children yet, what we obviously must sit around being bored with nothing to do and know where to go.
[time=172] Once you have children at your house, you can never not have children again.
[time=176] Exactly.
[time=177] Oh, Judy, seriously. I do hope we'll be seeing you and Leo at the festival of trees again this year.
[time=183] Oh, girls, I completely forgot about missing that. We'll have left already.
[time=190] She tell you, Judith, the professor has taken her away from us this Christmas.
[time=195] It's her seventh anniversary. I told him it was completely over the top.
[time=200] Go on, tell her Aggie.
[time=202] Sweden.
[time=203] He's taking me to Stockholm for our anniversary.
[time=206] As I live and breathe, Aggie, that is amazing.
[time=209] Norman would never be up for something like that. I can barely get him to take me into the city. I cannot even imagine.
[time=215] I cannot imagine spending Christmas away from home. How will you ever manage, Aggie?
[time=219] Well, I expect I'll manage the same as I do here in Seattle.
[time=223] Home is less of a place to me and more about being with the people you love.
[time=227] As long as I'm with Leo, I'm home for Christmas.
[time=232] A rough way to learn how we write.
[time=234] Yeah, you said it, B. We really do hope you have a wonderful time, Aggie.
[time=238] Thank you.
[time=239] Come on, Judith. I'll walk you home.
[time=241] Oh, do we have to all the noise and diapers and dishes?
[time=246] B, can't we just run away from it all? Maybe Fred and Bing need some extras in their next film?
[time=251] I know, darling. I know. We'll get you out in the bag again real soon.
[time=254] I promise.
[time=256] Oh, oh, my stars. I'm sorry.
[time=263] Excuse me. I didn't see you there.
[time=265] Okay. I couldn't help but overhearing.
[time=267] You'll find that Stockholm will be a lovely place this time of year.
[time=271] And I assure you, this will be one anniversary you shall not forget.
[time=275] Oh, well, well, thank you. I don't believe we've met yet. I'm Aggie.
[time=282] Yes, and before you leave next week, right?
[time=285] You're definitely going to want to take a look at this.
[time=287] Page 37, a most captivating read.
[time=290] Well, what does it say?
[time=292] Read the article, Aggie.
[time=294] Read every word and have a merry Christmas.
[time=299] Taxi!
[time=312] Who could be bothering me at this time of night?
[time=326] I despise this time of year.
[time=331] What is it?
[time=338] Why have you come? You are not welcome to hear that.
[time=342] Just a moment of your time.
[time=344] Blessings of music.
[time=346] Please, sir. Merry Christmas.
[time=348] On Christmas night, I demand that you stop.
[time=359] Those words are not welcome in my home.
[time=362] God is created by life.
[time=364] All of you get out. Get out.
[time=368] Never sing those songs again. Get out of this city.
[time=373] God has ruined my life.
[time=381] He has ruined it.
[time=386] Christmas time.
[time=390] A time of strong emotion, is it not?
[time=393] For some, like Aggie and her friends in Seattle, it's a time of great joy and excitement.
[time=399] For others, as you've just seen, it's a time for deep sorrow and regret.
[time=405] That was David Flood.
[time=407] Did you hear him?
[time=409] God has ruined his life.
[time=412] It's a rather preposterous statement, don't you think?
[time=415] Well, I'll admit the life of David Flood is, in fact, in ruins, how and by whom is still up for debate?
[time=422] Ironically, David Flood didn't always view his life this way.
[time=431] There was a time when his thoughts of God were quite the contrary.
[time=435] That being said, God did choose to impact David Flood's life in a rather unique way.
[time=441] God certainly would not see it as ruined.
[time=446] Sadly, Mr Flood has chosen to see it as such.
[time=451] Twenty-four years ago, David Flood would have said that God had saved his life.
[time=459] Not ruined it.
[time=461] He was so desperate to follow God that he committed his life to teach the truths of the Bible to whomever hadn't heard.
[time=469] He was rather passionate about his obedience to the Lord, and he was rather impassioned with his courtship, the beautiful young lady named Sveya Bjorkman.
[time=482] David, how wonderful to see you!
[time=485] I'm afraid Sveya's not home this evening, so you'll have to return another time.
[time=488] On the contrary, Dr Bjorkman, I intend to call upon you instead.
[time=493] Well, what a wonderful change of pace for a young man.
[time=496] Please, come in, may I offer you a drink?
[time=498] Oh, thank you, Dr.
[time=500] I have come tonight to ask for your consent.
[time=505] Ah, yes, my wife is just suspecting such a question just the other day. Please, go ahead.
[time=512] The consent I am asking is possibly a bit beyond your wife's suspicions.
[time=517] Indeed, I intend to request your permission to marry your daughter.
[time=522] Beyond my wife's suspicions, you say?
[time=525] Yes.
[time=527] I have now to ask whether you can consent to part with your daughter,
[time=533] to never see her again in this world, whether you can consent to her departure and to the subjection of the hardships and sufferings of missionary life.
[time=544] Whether you can consent to her exposure to the dangers of the ocean and to the fatal influence of the southern climate of Africa, can you consent to all this for the sake of Zion and to the glory of God?
[time=563] Amazingly, Dr Bjorkman said it was ultimately Speier's decision as to whether she would join David in marriage and in mission.
[time=571] The doctor told his daughter she could make up her own mind.
[time=576] My dearest David, I accept your invitation not only to marry you
[time=582] but to follow you wherever the Lord should lead you.
[time=585] I am willing and expect to spend my days on this earth in heathen lands.
[time=591] The Lord has granted me courage and determination to give up all my comforts here in Sweden and to sacrifice being close to family and friends in order to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ to those who have never heard.
[time=604] In this endeavor, David Flood, I am most honored to join you with all my love and affection, Speier.
[time=613] It took months to travel by boat from Sweden to the coast of Africa.
[time=623] In the Belgian Congo, the couple felt led of the Lord to settle outside the remote village of Indolura.
[time=631] The village chief there felt that the presence of the white couple would infuriate their gods.
[time=636] So David and Speier had no choice but to build a small mud hut a half a mile outside of the village.
[time=644] Eggs and chickens. You hungry? You buy. Eggs and chickens.
[time=650] David, who could that be?
[time=652] Let's go see who it is.
[time=654] Eggs and chicken, you say? Yes, we'll buy.
[time=660] But chief, does the chief know?
[time=662] He said we're not to speak to anyone.
[time=666] Chief send me. Chicken, eggs, you pay.
[time=669] The chief sent you. What is your name, child?
[time=672] My name, Ibiku. Chicken, eggs, you pay.
[time=676] Well, Ibiku, my name is Speier and I'm so very happy to meet you.
[time=681] And so Speier began a very sweet friendship with Ibiku.
[time=688] Twice a week, he would come to their hut to sell them food.
[time=692] Their visits became longer and longer.
[time=695] Well, they shared a common language of French.
[time=697] But Speier was able to teach him some Swedish words while he was able to teach her, Lingala.
[time=702] They enjoyed learning each other's cultures and customs.
[time=705] Why are you reading? I'm so happy that you asked.
[time=710] This is my most treasured possession.
[time=713] Come, I'll tell you all about it.
[time=716] Then of all things, Speier found herself pregnant
[time=722] in the middle of the primitive wilderness.
[time=724] During her pregnancy, the floods were permitted to see no one, but little Ibiku twice a week.
[time=730] They praised God for that relationship with Ibiku.
[time=733] They praised God for the life inside Speier.
[time=737] And then things changed.
[time=740] The time came for Speier to give birth.
[time=743] The village chief softened enough to allow a midwife to come and help.
[time=748] A little girl was born.
[time=750] But the delivery took a heavy blow upon Speier, whose body was already weak from bouts of malaria.
[time=759] The whole birthing process, it nearly wiped out her stamina.
[time=765] She lasted only another 17 days.
[time=779] Something snapped inside David at that moment.
[time=784] He dug a crude grave, buried his 23-year-old wife, and took his child back down the mountain to the mission station to leave her there permanently.
[time=796] I'm going back to Sweden.
[time=801] I've lost my wife.
[time=803] And I obviously cannot take care of this baby on my own.
[time=809] [MUSIC]
[time=822] And then David went down to the port, where he not only turned his back on his calling, but on God himself.
[time=831] [MUSIC]
[time=844] Well, the time has come.
[time=847] For decades, David flood his belief that his actions and his attitude have been justified.
[time=853] That anyone else in his position would have acted the exact same way.
[time=857] Well, tonight, he gets to learn that not everybody has chosen the path he has taken.
[time=863] That there are those who have chosen instead to believe that God is with us, even in the most confusing situations.
[time=872] Christmas Eve is no excuse to badger an old man.
[time=881] I swear, if you have come to sing me one more song about that to baby,
[time=890] I...
[time=892] Who are you?
[time=894] You have missed so many opportunities, David Flood.
[time=897] Opportunities to learn about the truth and what is most important in life.
[time=902] This gift of God will help adjust your perspective and prepare you for what has yet to come.
[time=908] What if I like my point of view and what if I'm rather enjoying my ignorance?
[time=914] And I don't need anything adjusted.
[time=917] Thank you.
[time=919] The choice is yours, Mr. Flood.
[time=921] You may choose to accept or reject my gift.
[time=923] Who does she think she is?
[time=927] Never mention the name of God in my house.
[time=930] He has ruined my life.
[time=932] And another thing.
[time=949] ♪
[time=971] I heard the bells on Christmas Day.
[time=975] Their old familiar carols play.
[time=980] What is this? Who are you and what permission do you have to be in my living room?
[time=985] Just a moment, please.
[time=986] For hate is strong and mocks that song of peace on earth.
[time=992] This is outrageous!
[time=995] Who is this young man and get him to a hospital?
[time=999] He is my son and the hospitals are all full.
[time=1002] And why am I in your living room?
[time=1004] It was prepared to inquire exactly the same of you.
[time=1007] Okay, I just turned the crank on that box and now I'm faced with another intruder.
[time=1012] Is he another casualty of this war?
[time=1016] Swedes remain neutral during this.
[time=1018] We will not be a part of this vile conflict.
[time=1021] Sweden?
[time=1022] Neutral?
[time=1023] Why would a Swede care about our civil war?
[time=1027] Civil war?
[time=1029] Where am I?
[time=1031] Is this some sort of Dickens' nightmare?
[time=1034] Cambridge, Massachusetts, my good man.
[time=1036] And you must be referring to that new Christmas story by Charles.
[time=1040] I have yet to get my hands on a copy, but its fame is sweeping throughout all of Europe and perhaps America one day as well.
[time=1048] Father, Father, I'm thirsty.
[time=1052] Charlie, lie still. I'm coming.
[time=1057] Hold on, my son.
[time=1060] What happened to him?
[time=1063] Charlie ran away from home to sign up with Lincoln's army.
[time=1066] For nearly two years, I heard not word from him.
[time=1069] And then only a week ago, they bring him to my doorstep with a bullet hole in his left shoulder.
[time=1074] His spine was nicked in Virginia at the Battle of New Hope Church.
[time=1079] Those rebels nearly paralyzed my son.
[time=1082] I'll get better, Father.
[time=1084] And when I do, I won't hesitate to return to the battlefield.
[time=1088] You rest for now, son. Just rest.
[time=1091] So you would not let him fight?
[time=1094] Perhaps you are more Swedish than you think.
[time=1097] I would give anything to end this war.
[time=1100] Even let my son join Union ranks.
[time=1103] However, he did not run on account of me.
[time=1107] Then why?
[time=1108] His mother.
[time=1110] The same year he ran away, we all watched his mother's dress catch fire right here in our home.
[time=1117] She never recovered from those injuries.
[time=1119] The hurt was more than he could bear.
[time=1122] Charlie had to escape it somehow.
[time=1125] Part of my manners could, sir.
[time=1127] What is your name?
[time=1128] David Flood.
[time=1130] And yours?
[time=1131] Henry Longfellow.
[time=1134] Henry Wadsworth, a longfellow?
[time=1137] Unbelievable!
[time=1139] Mr. Flood, have you ever lost someone you love so much?
[time=1144] You fear you will never stop.
[time=1146] Missing them?
[time=1148] What is that you were writing?
[time=1152] A poem?
[time=1154] The church bells of St. Michael's were ringing this evening and it got me thinking about peace and pain.
[time=1159] And I simply had to write it down.
[time=1161] Oh, when the inspiration comes, I cannot seem to suppress it.
[time=1165] May I?
[time=1173] And in despair, I bowed my head.
[time=1177] There is no peace on earth, I said.
[time=1183] For hate is strong and mocks the song.
[time=1190] Of peace on earth good will to men.
[time=1196] Then peel the bells more loud and deep.
[time=1201] God is not dead nor doth he sleep.
[time=1207] God is not dead, David Flood, nor doth he sleep.
[time=1211] Even when my son hangs between life and death, even when my wife died so tragically, he does not sleep.
[time=1218] I must go, where is that box?
[time=1220] Box, what box?
[time=1221] That box, it was in my hand only moments ago.
[time=1224] David Flood, you must have suffered loss, you must have, but do not despair.
[time=1229] The right will prevail, there can be peace on earth through God.
[time=1233] God is with you, Mr Flood, God is with you.
[time=1236] I see you accepted my gift.
[time=1245] Your gift, you mean your burden.
[time=1248] I demand you return me to my home this instant.
[time=1251] The music box will guide you every step of the way.
[time=1254] I have no control over where or when it takes you next.
[time=1258] The music box, where is it?
[time=1260] I had it in my hand only moments ago where I rotated the handle myself.
[time=1264] David Flood, patience, the box will show up exactly when you need it next.
[time=1270] Until then, I suggest you enjoy discovering what you need to learn in this time and place.
[time=1277] What is your name?
[time=1280] I beg you upon.
[time=1282] I cream lock.
[time=1284] I am sorry, I do not understand.
[time=1287] I ask your name.
[time=1289] What is your name?
[time=1290] I understand now.
[time=1292] David Flood.
[time=1293] Well, David Flood, you are in for a world of trouble.
[time=1298] Who let you be on the dividing wall?
[time=1301] Please, tell me of this peculiar costume.
[time=1304] Are these the new fashions from Rome?
[time=1306] Uh, no.
[time=1308] Well, are you here to worship?
[time=1310] Where are your sacrifices?
[time=1312] You do not have a goat or dove.
[time=1314] Perhaps you need to purchase them from the court of the Gentiles.
[time=1317] The money changers can assist you.
[time=1318] I assure you I am not here to worship.
[time=1321] Well, what a surprising remark.
[time=1323] I assumed since you were headed toward the temple, you were here for a reason.
[time=1327] Anna just sent me here to inquire of your intentions for this visit.
[time=1331] Anna?
[time=1332] Yes, Anna.
[time=1334] You do not know of Anna?
[time=1336] Certainly everyone here has heard of Anna.
[time=1339] She's been here my entire life.
[time=1342] Well, when my parents would come here with me every year, first she did not live here, she would wander around the city, going around praying and worshiping and prophesying, and then the priests offered her that home above the royal stoa, and there she has lived ever since.
[time=1357] Anna, from the Gospel of Luke.
[time=1362] Who?
[time=1364] Luke, Dr. Luke's Gospel from the New Testament.
[time=1367] Those names are new to me.
[time=1370] Perhaps Anna can assist you.
[time=1371] She really is the most remarkable woman of God.
[time=1374] You will not believe what she just told me.
[time=1377] You should ask her yourself.
[time=1379] Tell me, what did she say?
[time=1383] She saw him.
[time=1386] The baby.
[time=1388] The one them remnant has been speaking of.
[time=1391] The one we all thought Herod must have killed.
[time=1394] Well, she believes he was not killed, but that he was in Egypt with his family during the night of the horrific murders.
[time=1399] And of course an angel warned them in a dream.
[time=1402] Yes, and in spite of all that, when his parents brought him here just eight days after his birth,
[time=1408] she held him, the manacham, the consolar of Israel, the one Isaiah told us about.
[time=1415] It really is the most amazing story.
[time=1417] Oh, you really should just ask her yourself, because there she sits.
[time=1421] No longer waiting for the Messiah, but waiting for all who will listen, just to tell them of the coming redemption of Israel.
[time=1430] Yeah, perhaps I should speak to this Anna.
[time=1435] Shalom David Flood.
[time=1437] God be with you.
[time=1439] Shalom, my son.
[time=1446] Please.
[time=1448] Sit.
[time=1450] Listen to what God has done for an old woman.
[time=1457] Jehovah changed my life forever.
[time=1461] When I was only 20 years old, after seven years of marriage, my husband Ruben died.
[time=1470] So suddenly my heart was broken.
[time=1474] Much to my surprise.
[time=1477] I felt the presence of Jehovah burning in my chest.
[time=1482] Even while I still mourned Ruben's death, he was calling me to the temple.
[time=1490] He was calling me here.
[time=1494] He was calling me here to pray, and fast for Monica to come.
[time=1502] For 64 years, I petitioned Jehovah night and day.
[time=1512] Then one day, as quickly as you can imagine,
[time=1518] the burden was lifted when Simeon called my name.
[time=1524] He was holding a beautiful child.
[time=1528] A baby boy who brought peace to my anxious heart.
[time=1535] I knew the moment I had prayed for had finally arrived.
[time=1542] Sometimes I wonder, David's blood.
[time=1548] What if I would have missed that moment?
[time=1552] If Ruben were still alive, would I have been at the temple?
[time=1556] The day that Joseph brought his son?
[time=1560] Jehovah gave me the most precious gift of holding the Messiah in my arms.
[time=1568] Something that probably never would have happened without Ruben's death.
[time=1574] God was with me in those moments, David fled.
[time=1578] And God was with you when your wife died too.
[time=1583] And God is with you even now.
[time=1586] I will not hear it, not another word.
[time=1588] I know it can be difficult to listen to the truth.
[time=1593] David.
[time=1598] The information you requested, Madam.
[time=1604] Thank you.
[time=1605] That'll be 187 Crooner.
[time=1607] We do not accept American currency.
[time=1609] To exchange a currency, please go down the hall last door on your left.
[time=1613] No, that's quite all right.
[time=1614] I have plenty of Chrono with me.
[time=1616] 187, correct?
[time=1617] That's right.
[time=1618] Next in line, please.
[time=1621] Oh, excuse me.
[time=1624] Thank you.
[time=1633] Okay, God, more addresses.
[time=1637] I guess this is not going to be as easy as I thought.
[time=1641] Well, where on earth do you want me to go from here?
[time=1645] There's just one after the other, the list never ends.
[time=1649] Perhaps you should look on the last page.
[time=1651] A third from the bottom, a little cobblestone off of Drutney-Gotten.
[time=1656] You look rather familiar.
[time=1659] There's a train headed for that district in 35 minutes.
[time=1662] The train station's right across the street from the library here.
[time=1665] Take my ticket.
[time=1666] What?
[time=1667] Oh, no, I couldn't.
[time=1669] My husband, he's back.
[time=1670] It's the last train of the evening.
[time=1673] Now, when you get off, look for Drutney-Gotten, head north.
[time=1676] The next beginner's section is Soul Grand. Take a left.
[time=1680] The house you're looking for is just a few blocks from there.
[time=1683] Do I know you from somewhere?
[time=1686] The train leaves in 35 minutes.
[time=1689] All the instructions are on the back of the ticket.
[time=1692] Best wishes to you. Merry Christmas.
[time=1703] Drutney-Gotten?
[time=1706] Is that where you want me to go next?
[time=1709] I've tried so many other places.
[time=1714] Couldn't we have met before I shelled out 187 crumpets?
[time=1720] Or no, a crump, whatever they call it here.
[time=1726] All right.
[time=1730] Drutney-Gotten? Here we go.
[time=1734] How dare you.
[time=1747] You spirit.
[time=1749] You being you, whatever you are.
[time=1752] You have no right to interfere with my pain.
[time=1756] You have no idea what I have been through.
[time=1759] Do you know the heartache of digging your own wife's grave?
[time=1764] Tell me of your loneliness in an empty home night after night.
[time=1769] Year after year.
[time=1771] Have you two been tormented by regrets picking at your conscience unceasingly?
[time=1779] Never mind. Do not bother.
[time=1782] Just tell me where I am and what God wants me to do next.
[time=1788] Welcome to Moscow.
[time=1792] I'm sorry I cannot reveal the reason why we're here in this time and place.
[time=1796] But I can introduce you to that nice young man over there.
[time=1800] His name is Jakob.
[time=1802] And he is just finishing his craft as the other orphans are finishing their dinner.
[time=1808] Now go, meet him, and I suggest you listen to what he has to say.
[time=1818] Good day, Jakob.
[time=1822] I am Mr. David Flood from Sweden.
[time=1825] It is Christmas Eve and I would very much like to go home.
[time=1828] So please tell me what it is you want me to know.
[time=1831] More importantly, can you tell me the whereabouts of a smallish music box?
[time=1835] I need it to get home.
[time=1837] That's silly. How can a music box feel to get home?
[time=1840] How does it know where you live?
[time=1842] Not a poor question at home, my boy.
[time=1845] I really don't understand how it works.
[time=1847] Magical, I guess.
[time=1849] Every time that obnoxious tune plays, my faculty seem to dissipate more and more into oblivion.
[time=1857] What?
[time=1858] Ignore that.
[time=1859] Actually, I cannot guarantee that it will take me home next.
[time=1864] But I am fully convinced there is no way to return home without it.
[time=1869] If I were you, I would just fly home.
[time=1872] You look like you have enough money for a ticket.
[time=1874] If I were my home was, I would fly there too.
[time=1877] If only it were that simple.
[time=1880] And I think you are wrong.
[time=1882] A recurring theme this evening.
[time=1884] The music box has a beautiful tune.
[time=1886] And I am going to play it tonight before I go to sleep.
[time=1889] Then you have seen it. Do you have it with you now?
[time=1892] No.
[time=1893] Why not?
[time=1894] I don't. Oh, why not?
[time=1895] No. Are you not afraid the other kids will steal it?
[time=1898] No. Are you?
[time=1900] Yes. Very afraid.
[time=1902] We must retrieve it at once.
[time=1904] I can't.
[time=1905] Yes, you can.
[time=1907] No, I can't.
[time=1909] Why in the world not?
[time=1910] My craft.
[time=1912] But you just finished your craft.
[time=1914] Now, on your feet, show me the box.
[time=1916] No, I can't.
[time=1918] For the sake of heaven and earth, why not?
[time=1923] I need to tell you a secret, Mr. Flood.
[time=1927] You have to promise not to tell the other children.
[time=1931] Of course. Of course.
[time=1933] My ninja has two babies.
[time=1935] By the looks of things, I suspect that secret would be rather hard to keep.
[time=1942] That's not the secret, Mr. Flood.
[time=1945] When eyelids used in the manger, he looked at me.
[time=1949] He asked me if I had a place to stay.
[time=1952] I told him I have no mama and no papa, so I have no place to stay.
[time=1957] But I wanted to stay with him so much.
[time=1960] So I thought maybe if I kept him warm, that would be a good enough gift.
[time=1964] So I asked him, if I keep you warm, whether that would be a good enough gift.
[time=1968] Then Jesus told me if you kept me warm, that would be the best gift anybody ever gave me.
[time=1974] So I got into the manger.
[time=1976] Then Jesus looked at me.
[time=1978] He told me I could stay with him for always.
[time=1982] Jacob, that is the most delightful secret I have ever heard.
[time=1989] Jesus was with me, Mr. Flood, and I'm with him.
[time=1992] Maybe your music box can take you to be with Jesus too.
[time=1997] Here it is.
[time=2002] Thank you, Jacob.
[time=2009] And I hope you have a very merry Christmas.
[time=2018] Jacob, you've had this music box all along.
[time=2023] Why did you wait till now to fetch it?
[time=2026] I wasn't with my manger yet.
[time=2028] Oh, right, of course.
[time=2044] Hello, the door was open.
[time=2049] I hate to intrude, but really, is anybody home?
[time=2054] It worked.
[time=2066] My home.
[time=2068] Not the inside of my home, but my home.
[time=2071] Let's see.
[time=2073] That's better.
[time=2076] Not on the outside, but on the inside.
[time=2079] It's so good to finally be at...
[time=2082] I'm so sorry.
[time=2084] No, no, no, no.
[time=2086] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[time=2116] No! No!
[time=2120] I'm sorry, I hate to interrupt.
[time=2125] No more dreams. I am finished. I am through. I am done.
[time=2131] Listen, I'm sorry. The door was wide open and my ship leaves in a few days.
[time=2136] It is very important to me that I meet a Mr. David Flood.
[time=2140] Are you David Flood?
[time=2143] Ship? What year is it?
[time=2148] 1944.
[time=2153] Are you real?
[time=2158] Unfortunately for you, I guess. Aggie Hearst?
[time=2165] Are you David Flood?
[time=2168] Fortunately for you, I guess.
[time=2173] So, why is it so important that you meet me?
[time=2179] I have very good reason to believe that you are my father.
[time=2185] Father?
[time=2195] I'm afraid so.
[time=2199] Maybe not. Maybe not. I came all the way from Seattle.
[time=2205] My husband and I are here celebrating our anniversary and we received this magazine shortly before we left.
[time=2214] It has a picture. I thought maybe you would recognize it.
[time=2220] I don't know. The others didn't, but maybe you will.
[time=2228] Would you please take a look at it?
[time=2241] Sveya? You recognize it?
[time=2250] I made that cross.
[time=2255] I etched her name with my own hands. I dug that.
[time=2265] Sveya?
[time=2269] Papa?
[time=2272] Aggie?
[time=2275] Oh, Aggie, I never meant to give you away.
[time=2279] Oh, no, no. It's all right. God took care of me.
[time=2284] God. God forgot about us, Aggie. We would have been better off without him.
[time=2295] There is something you should know.
[time=2299] There is more to this story than you realize.
[time=2303] You didn't go to Africa in vain. Mama didn't die in vain.
[time=2308] Listen, it says here that little boy she met, a biku.
[time=2317] He grew up. He grew up to teach the whole village to love Jesus.
[time=2322] The one seed you planted just kept growing and growing.
[time=2326] Today, there are more than 600 African people serving the Lord because you were faithful.
[time=2334] You were faithful to the call of God in your life.
[time=2339] Papa, Jesus loves you. He has never hated you.
[time=2348] Oh, but I have hated him so much, Aggie. So much.
[time=2357] Even so, he has not left you.
[time=2365] I am so pleased to meet you, Aggie-hurst.
[time=2382] And with that, David Flood began to return to the God he had resented for so many years.
[time=2386] Over the next few days, a father and daughter enjoyed some warm moments together.
[time=2392] Then Aggie and her husband had to return to America.
[time=2396] A few weeks after that, David Flood passed into eternity with his God, with Sveya II.
[time=2405] That Christmas, David Flood learned that Emmanuel means God with us, whether we realize it or not.
[time=2413] And he learned that painful experiences are not as black and white as they seem.
[time=2418] Just because something hurts doesn't make it wrong, I tell you the truth.
[time=2424] If a single kernel of wheat really falls to the ground, it remains only a single seed.
[time=2430] But if it dies, it produces many seeds.
[time=2435] David Flood's life was sown with many tears, but now he reaps only songs of joy.
[time=2442] [MUSIC]
[time=2455] I know so many of you in the room this morning, but there are so many of you I don't know.
[time=2460] We would never presume to know your circumstance or what condition you are as you sit in this room this morning.
[time=2469] But I want to remind you of the great truth that just got played out for us this morning.
[time=2475] And it is a great truth found in a number of different places in the Scriptures.
[time=2479] But could I read for you this morning and could you just listen and take in these words?
[time=2485] God communicates to the people of Israel through the prophet Isaiah.
[time=2489] And in Isaiah 55 verses 8 and 9, God says this.
[time=2495] He says, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways," declares the Lord.
[time=2508] "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways,
[time=2516] and my thoughts higher than your thoughts."
[time=2525] If you've ever experienced that to be true in your life, nod your head.
[time=2530] You know that to be true, and I know that to be true, and oh my goodness how David Flood realized that to be true late in his life.
[time=2539] Let me just give you a little background on that passage, just a few insights to these words.
[time=2544] The word thoughts in the Hebrew, your thoughts aren't my thoughts, God says.
[time=2550] The word thoughts there, these are things that you think about, specifically your hopes, your dreams.
[time=2557] Thoughts are what come to mind when you're thinking about what you want, what would be good.
[time=2564] When you're thinking about how you think things should be, these are your thoughts.
[time=2573] And God says to the people of Israel, and God says to you and me this morning, "Mine?" He says to you, "Mine aren't yours." Our thoughts are different.
[time=2586] And he doesn't just stop though in the mental realm. He goes on into the physical realm, that's right because where you see in that passage,
[time=2594] him transition from thoughts to ways. Let me just give you the word ways here.
[time=2599] It's a word that means the plans we make and the steps we take to follow those plans.
[time=2607] It's one thing to think about how life should be.
[time=2610] It's one thing to think about how we think it ought to play out.
[time=2614] It's another thing when we start to actually make plans, the ways that you end up pursuing.
[time=2621] God says not only are your thoughts, but also your ways are different than mine.
[time=2627] How different are God's ways and God's thoughts than yours in mine?
[time=2638] He answers that force right here in the passage. It says as high as the heavens are above the earth.
[time=2649] As high as the heavens are above the earth, that's how different God says my will, my intentions, my thoughts and ways are different than yours.
[time=2662] I don't know where your mind goes when you hear or you read the scriptures and you hear me say as high as the heavens.
[time=2670] We could talk solar systems, we could talk galaxies, we could talk space and the outer stratospheres.
[time=2680] We could because that's exactly what he means. It's exactly what that word heavens means, translated.
[time=2687] I could give you a truckload of mind-boggling statistics, but I just pulled one out.
[time=2695] I read about it this week, the distance how much higher are his ways than ours as high as the heavens are from the earth.
[time=2704] I did a little reading recently on the distance between earth and Pluto, the farthest planet out.
[time=2713] Certainly not the farthest thing out. Do you understand that?
[time=2718] There are stars and there are multiple galaxies beyond Pluto, but the distance between earth and Pluto, 7,440 million miles.
[time=2736] 7 billion miles is the difference between the way you think and the plans you make and the way he thinks and the plans he makes.
[time=2756] Listen, in the study of this text, one other thing that comes to light is the fact that not only is this difference between the way he thinks and plans,
[time=2768] what he allows and what he enacts and his will, not only is this idea of over 7 billion supposed to connotate with amount of distance,
[time=2779] it's also speaking to quality. Don't just say it's different.
[time=2787] Say it's better. It's higher. It's what that word higher means. It's a step up, my friends.
[time=2797] It's as good as it gets. His thoughts, his ways, his will, absolutely utterly confusing to you and to me. It's that different.
[time=2814] But when you stop and think about it, aren't you glad that he's different than me?
[time=2820] Aren't you thankful that he's different than you? And now, aren't you even 7 billion times as grateful?
[time=2829] That his ways and his plans and what he will allow brings with it a purpose and a meaning that only he at times can understand.
[time=2838] So why we ask this morning with the story of David Flood and you, why be shocked? Why be angry or confused by what our God allows with respect to?
[time=2851] And I'll just have you think about these three things just briefly this morning.
[time=2855] Why be shocked, angry or confused by what our good God allows with respect to our suffering?
[time=2864] Let me just stop right there. Some of you in the room this morning are suffering.
[time=2870] Some of you are experiencing physical suffering. Some of you are experiencing relational suffering in your home and your marriage with your kids.
[time=2880] Some of you are experiencing employment suffering. Some of you, the condition, the circumstance of your life right now.
[time=2888] It is beyond what you ever thought it would be and it brings with it a pain and a heartache. You are not sure you can bear.
[time=2898] And yet God's word says to you in the book of James chapter 1, consider it all joy when you encounter various trials.
[time=2908] Knowing this that the testing of your faith produces endurance and even that word endurance carries with it the idea, the picture of time.
[time=2919] There are situations certainly when what you face or what I face lasts but a moment but there seems to be so many other times where endurance, endurance is needed.
[time=2936] Consider it all joy, he says, when you encounter various trials knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance and let endurance have its perfect effect on you.
[time=2947] That you would be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
[time=2954] That might be a week. That might be a month.
[time=2961] What did Anna, the prophetess say, the burden in her heart she had been praying for how many years did you catch it, how many?
[time=2969] 64 years.
[time=2973] But God was faithful and he brings an answer.
[time=2977] Why be shocked, angry or confused by what our good God allows with respect to our suffering, our waiting?
[time=2986] Some of you in the room this morning are waiting, you're waiting and waiting and you've been waiting and for many of you I know this passage brings great comfort.
[time=2997] Look at Psalm 27, if you have your Bibles you could even turn there. Psalm 27, 13 and 14, he is good. His will is perfect.
[time=3008] He makes no mistakes. He is on the throne. Nothing got by him. He's not surprised by anything.
[time=3016] How could he be in his sovereignty and in his providence?
[time=3020] He allows this life of ours to unfold and he gives us hope where it says here in Psalm 27, 13.
[time=3028] I would have despaired the psalmist wrote, I would have despaired unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.
[time=3040] Wait for the Lord.
[time=3044] Be strong and let your heart take courage, but oh yes, wait for the Lord.
[time=3054] His thoughts, not our thoughts. His ways, not our ways.
[time=3058] Over seven billion miles is the difference and so in the midst of that be astounded, be encouraged and be hopeful for what God allows with respect to our suffering, our waiting and our loss.
[time=3075] The third thing I hope you'll write down, loss, what a painful thing, loss is.
[time=3084] I have the privilege this week of being a part of a memorial service, a funeral for our dear friend, Rina lastly, Oscars here this morning.
[time=3098] I'm so grateful for Oscar in his 94 years, so thankful for Rina and her 90 years found out they were married 70 years raised and I met them all, seven kids in a house with three bedrooms and one and a half baths.
[time=3119] Dinner got made every night.
[time=3121] Whatever was left over got taken down the street to those in need.
[time=3125] Socks got mended, clothes got shared, didn't have much. They said she was a genius with bacon grease.
[time=3136] She could make anything they said when there was nothing.
[time=3142] And I looked at that family and their love for God and their love for Oscar and their love for Rina and to be quite honest though there was a sadness in the room over her being gone.
[time=3153] There was nothing but great joy in that loss.
[time=3162] But then there is loss that is more difficult than there is loss that doesn't make sense.
[time=3173] We can think back to June this past summer losing our friends Steve and Kim Hatch and as I've told you before sitting on the floor of that hotel room when I got the phone call out in California just begging God to somehow give me strength to make it through what I knew would be difficult days
[time=3191] Because in that moment he made absolutely utterly no sense to me. I even said it to him I said God you look bad right now.
[time=3204] Truth is God isn't bad and the truth is four, five, six months has brought some perspective but you know what?
[time=3214] As you talk with the family and as you talk with good friends there's no big glaring unbelievable sense of oh that's why you did it.
[time=3223] None of it still hurts. We still miss them.
[time=3228] We're still wondering what that Romans 828 good will be that he causes when all things happen.
[time=3237] It might be a week. It might be a month. It might be years.
[time=3243] But the Scriptures have shown us again and again that God is good.
[time=3249] Look with me would you at Luke just real quick.
[time=3253] My mind went to this passage this morning as I watched the David Flood story unfold.
[time=3261] It's a passage that you and I will read and I'm sure here read often over these next several weeks but would you look at it with me Luke 1.
[time=3269] The reason I'm having us go to Luke 1 is I want to just remind you this morning at no other time in all of history.
[time=3274] Have we seen such a, in my opinion, maybe at no other time, such a his plans aren't like ours moment.
[time=3287] And this moment got to be experienced by a 15 year old girl engaged to be married.
[time=3296] Verse 26 now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph of the descendants of David and the virgin's name was Mary.
[time=3311] And coming in he said to her greetings favored one.
[time=3317] Angel comes in and says to the 14 15 year old poor girl on the verge of the rest of her life.
[time=3327] He says greetings favored one the Lord is with you but she was very perplexed you think.
[time=3333] At this statement and kept pondering what kind of salutation this was and the angel goes on and says to her don't be afraid.
[time=3340] Don't be afraid Mary for you have found favor with God and behold you will conceive in your womb and bear a son and shall name him Jesus.
[time=3351] He will be great and will be called the son of the most high and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever and his kingdom will have no end.
[time=3367] An angel says to a 14 year old in the middle of the night and I love I've always loved verse 34 and Mary said to the angel what how can what this be.
[time=3394] A 14 year old would say really.
[time=3398] Are you kidding me how how can this be she says I'm a virgin.
[time=3405] And now in 35 the whole passage shifts watch this in its dimension.
[time=3411] The dimension up to 34 is the literal the physical right right there and now all of a sudden his ways are higher than our ways his thoughts are different than our thoughts.
[time=3423] Oh my goodness hang on 35 it just kicks in the angel answered and said to her the Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you.
[time=3435] And for that reason the Holy child shall be called the son of God and behold even your relative Elizabeth has also conceived 7 billion miles different how could that be a son in her old age and she who was called Baron is now in her sixth month
[time=3452] for here it is church verse 37 for nothing will be impossible with God.
[time=3463] Amen this is the message of the day nothing nothing is impossible with God and don't you dare try and put him in your box to get it done.
[time=3479] He will accomplish the impossible and extraordinary ways and if you're here this morning and you don't know him.
[time=3487] If you're here this morning and you've never fully bow the knee of your heart and fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ I would hope this morning that you would be astounded at the lengths to which he went to call you his own.
[time=3502] It's extraordinary way in which he brings his son to this earth to live a perfect life and die a brutal death and defeat that death.
[time=3515] As he defeats death and comes out of the tomb three days later to offer you and me eternal life no longer under the bondage or power of sin.
[time=3532] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
