[time=30] - Well, you know, one of the great joys of Christmas and one of the great privileges that we get to participate in every year as a family here at Black Hawk is our year-end compassion gift.
[time=44] We call it gifts that go, and it is a great joy for us to, at the end of every calendar year, join in with many of you in our viewing audience and give a financial gift.
[time=56] We collect this gift all through the month of December, and have committed to send 100% of what comes in to needy people, to physically, emotionally, circumstantially needy people here or across the world, and this year's project is one that I think you'll find extremely compelling.
[time=79] Over the last five or six years, God has allowed us to come across compelling situations here and around the globe, and we've had the joy of giving thousands and thousands of dollars to those in need.
[time=93] I want you to watch this video, and I hope as you watch, I hope you'll open your heart, I really do.
[time=99] I hope you'll consider what God may want you to do as we try our very best with His help to give a gift that goes to those in need.
[time=109] - Kids in Africa who have special needs just love different lives.
[time=114] - In the culture where there's extreme poverty, special needs kids are even more at risk of being abandoned.
[time=122] - First of all, they don't have the healthcare that we have here in the United States, so they are not able to get the medical care that they need to help them with their disabilities.
[time=130] - Kids with disabilities in Kenya, there's not much that can be done for them.
[time=135] - The poverty is so bad that parents literally have to decide which children they're gonna feed, and when you're a special needs child, the odds of you being abandoned and left on your own or increased even more.
[time=151] - One of the big issues that they face is the fact that in Kenya, they are often seen as an outcast.
[time=157] People don't know what to do when they don't know how to handle kids with disabilities, so they're kind of considered just an outcast to the community.
[time=164] - There's this place, New Life Home.
[time=166] - What I love about New Life Home, they've seen that issue and they've decided to do something about it.
[time=173] - They know that there are kids who are in their care, that because of physical or mental disabilities, may not get adapted and need a place to call home.
[time=184] - They don't discriminate whether it's HIV positive or a physical handicap or a mental handicap.
[time=190] If it's an abandoned baby, they're gonna rescue it.
[time=194] - And they take these kids in and they show 'em love and they show 'em just what a home is like and they really take 'em in and they show God's love to them.
[time=204] [MUSIC - 28 seconds]
[time=237] - I love spending time with them.
[time=239] They're kids that are full of joy and full of love and I think that's a result of the care that they're receiving.
[time=246] - Being able to see God's love being shown to all these children and being able to see how wonderful this place was.
[time=254] I was not expecting what I saw when I went.
[time=257] - They're loved and they're respected and they're cared for as part of a family which you wouldn't want anything better.
[time=265] - God has put the opportunity and the need in front of them to care for these special needs children for the duration of their life.
[time=274] - What New Life Home has decided that they wanna do is to add an addition to one of their current homes and it's gonna be specifically for these kids who have special needs.
[time=285] - This home will need to be equipped for children with wheelchairs and walkers and that are gonna need intense care.
[time=291] So their goal is to be able to build a home that's specialized just for their needs.
[time=296] (upbeat music)
[time=317] (singing) - What we wanna do is build 10 rooms
[time=329] as part of this addition.
[time=330] Our goal as a church family is to raise $75,000.
[time=334] - $75,000.
[time=335] - We get to be extravagant in our generosity and we're asking the Black Hawk family to raise $75,000 this Christmas.
[time=344] - The mission of this project is for us to take God's money and allocate it towards this project.
[time=352] - There are so many problems and issues in this world and things that we could get behind and support.
[time=358] But at the end of the day, the Bible talks a lot about how God has a heart for the poor and the fatherless.
[time=366] - The children that are there often deemed as outcast and unadoptable and that's so contrary to God's love for us.
[time=373] And as a family, I just pray that we will be able to use the generous gifts that God has given us to be His hands and feet.
[time=381] (upbeat music) - Wow, what a story.
[time=400] What a great, great opportunity for you and for me.
[time=403] I love what God is doing at New Life Home Trust and we have as a family grown to be so close with them over these last five or six years.
[time=413] I've gone to that very orphanage and I've helped those kids in my arms two or three times over the last few years.
[time=421] And now that we get to build these rooms, now that we get to try our best to care for these 10 kids, these 10 orphans with special needs, I can't think of a way.
[time=433] I can't think of a way to better bless them.
[time=436] I can't think of a way to better pass along the attributes and the character of God, his love and his compassion and his kindness than sending them a check to help them build these 10 rooms.
[time=449] So I hope you will.
[time=450] I hope you'll jump in and join us.
[time=452] Go to our website at blackhalkministries.org.
[time=455] On the homepage, there's a big Christmas with Blackhawk block.
[time=459] And if you just click on the learn more about CWB, you're gonna go to a page where you can watch the video again and then you can make your own personal donation.
[time=470] I hope you'll share this video with friends.
[time=473] I hope you'll pass it along to folks who may want to also join us in financially caring for and coming alongside these orphans.
[time=481] God bless you for being a part of our family.
[time=484] Thank you so much for what you'll do in the days to come.
[time=487] And as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=1066] (audience applauds) - It all happened in a moment, a most remarkable moment.
[time=1080] As moments go, it didn't appear to be much different than any other, and if you somehow pick it up off the timeline and examine it, it would look exactly like the moments that have passed since we began.
[time=1094] It was preceded and succeeded.
[time=1097] It was one of the countless moments that have marked time since eternity became measurable.
[time=1104] And through that segment of time, something spectacular occurred.
[time=1109] God became man.
[time=1115] Well, creatures walked the earth unaware.
[time=1117] Divinity arrived.
[time=1123] Heaven opened and placed her most precious one in a human womb.
[time=1130] The omnipotent became breakable.
[time=1133] He who was spirit became percible.
[time=1138] He who was larger than the universe became an embryo.
[time=1143] And he who sustains the world with the word chose to be dependent upon the nourishment of a young girl.
[time=1153] God asked fetus, holiness sleeping in a womb.
[time=1161] The creator being created.
[time=1166] God was given eyebrows, elbows, two kidneys and a spleen.
[time=1170] And he stretched against the walls and floated in the amniotic fluids of his mother.
[time=1179] God had come near.
[time=1182] He came not as a flash of light or an inapproachable conqueror, but one whose first cries were heard by a peasant girl and a sleepy carpenter.
[time=1196] The hands that first held him were unmanicured and calloused.
[time=1204] There was no silk, no ivory, no hype, no party, no hoopla, had it not been for the shepherds.
[time=1212] There would have been no reception.
[time=1214] And had it not been for a group of stargazers, there would have been no gifts.
[time=1221] The angels watched as Mary changed God's diaper.
[time=1228] The universe watched as the Almighty learned to walk.
[time=1235] Children played in the street with him.
[time=1237] And the synagogue leader in Nazareth, he didn't have a clue who he was listening to.
[time=1244] In Jesus 33 years, he experienced everything we've experienced.
[time=1250] He grew weak, he grew tired, he feared failure.
[time=1255] He was susceptible to wooing women.
[time=1259] He got cold, he burped, and he had body odor.
[time=1266] His feelings got hurt, his feet got tired and his head ached.
[time=1270] You know, it almost seems irreverent
[time=1276] when we think of Jesus in such a light, doesn't it?
[time=1279] It's uncomfortable, it's something we don't like to do.
[time=1284] It's much easier to keep the humanity out of the divinity.
[time=1289] Clean the manure from around the manger, wipe the sweat out of his eyes to pretend that he never snored or picked his nose or hit his thumb with a hammer.
[time=1302] No, it's much easier to pretend he was never human in the first place.
[time=1308] There's something about keeping him divine that keeps him distant, packaged and predictable, but don't do it.
[time=1318] For heaven's sake, don't.
[time=1320] Let him be as human as he intended to be.
[time=1324] For only by letting him in to our world, can he pull us out?

[time=2086] (audience applauding) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - That night there were shepherds staying in the fields nearby, guarding their flocks of sheep.
[time=2101] Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared among them and the radiance of the Lord's glory surrounded them.
[time=2108] They were terrified, but the angel reassured them, "Don't be afraid," he said, "I bring you good news "that will bring great joy to all people.
[time=2118] "The Savior, yes, the Messiah, the Lord, "has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David.
[time=2126] "And you will recognize him by this sign.
[time=2129] "You will find a baby wrapped snuggly in strips of cloth "lying in a manger." Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others, the armies of heaven, praising God and saying glory to God in highest heaven and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased.
[time=2149] - Well, you heard Susan read about it earlier.
[time=2152] That's the lyrics of the songs that the angels actually heard.
[time=2157] Excuse me, that the shepherds actually heard 2000 years ago.
[time=2161] The angels were singing, the shepherds were listening.
[time=2163] Can you imagine what that was like to see the sky split open and angels declaring that truth in song?
[time=2171] I'm gonna read to you more of Luke 2.
[time=2173] It says, "After the shepherds heard the angel's song, "they hurried into the village.
[time=2178] "They found Mary Joseph and the baby, "exactly what the angel said they'd see.
[time=2184] "After seeing the baby, the shepherds did not keep "what they saw to themselves.
[time=2188] "They left and told everyone what the angel had said "to them about this child.
[time=2194] "And all who heard the shepherd's story were astonished.
[time=2198] "And this morning, in the spirit of the shepherds, "we wanna share with you some astonishing stories.
[time=2205] "There's people right here in our church family "who haven't had the sky split open "and the angels sing to them a message, "but they've encountered God "in some pretty miraculous ways this year.
[time=2218] "And I've asked several of them to share with you "their astonishing story, "not that you'd be astonished with them "or that you'd be astonished with how things turned out "for them, but that you'd be amazed by a God "who wasn't just a manual when Jesus was born, "but a God who is an Immanuel every day "to every person around the world all the time.
[time=2238] "So I hope that as you listen, you're encouraged and amazed "at how God is with these people." - My name is Dave.
[time=2249] At my routine physical and subsequent test this past summer, my doctors discovered that the aorta to my heart had been severely damaged for over a year.
[time=2259] I realized immediately that I had been living on borrowed time and didn't even know it.
[time=2264] I was immediately sent to the hospital for further test and possible emergency surgery.
[time=2269] And all the medical team concurred that what I had was one of the largest aneurysms they had seen in a living person.
[time=2276] 80% of the patients would have died long before the doctors ever discovered that the damage was done.
[time=2284] My surgery ended up being scheduled a couple weeks later, which gave me time to go home and prepare for what would be a long and difficult surgery and recovery.
[time=2294] During that time, I was able to be with my children and family and they were a comfort to help me.
[time=2302] I was in a position that was very difficult for me.
[time=2305] That of watching my family work and help me do things that I could not do for myself.
[time=2312] That night before my surgery, my wife, sons, and daughters-in-law all gathered around me and lifted prayers to God on my behalf, a moment I will cherish forever.
[time=2325] My family experienced overwhelmingly support from the Black Hawk Church family.
[time=2332] The visits, the phone calls, the meals, the prayers, where God's love and action to us during a difficult season.
[time=2341] I am living proof that God alone knows our days and am more determined than ever to make every day count for him, for eternity.
[time=2350] God is with us.
[time=2351] - My name is Andrea.
[time=2355] In the past year, I've had the opportunity to make four trips to Kenya.
[time=2360] Each time I have felt God drawing me to serve the children and the people of Kibera, a one square mile slum that is home to over 1 million people with no water, no sewers, and very little electricity.
[time=2375] During one trip, I felt God prompting me to help my friend Isaac, a 15-year-old orphan who lives in Kibera and functions as a five-year-old.
[time=2385] I knew helping Isaac would take all the money that I had left, even the money I needed for a taxi to get to the airport, and yet I felt God saying, "Trust me, it is the right thing to do." And so I gave to Isaac the last of the money that I had.
[time=2402] The next morning, I still did not know how I was gonna get home.
[time=2405] As I was packing my backpack, I found a card that had been given to me months earlier.
[time=2412] My dear friends had written me a note of encouragement, and they'd also enclosed a love gift of crisp, new bills, not a check that I could not have cashed, not old wrinkled bills that the exchange would not accept, but exactly what I needed to exchange into shillings.
[time=2430] And yes, it was just enough for the taxi.
[time=2433] Oftentimes, people will say to me they don't understand how a single female like me can go and serve in the slums of a third-world country by myself.
[time=2443] My response to them is often, I may buy just one ticket, but I am never alone.
[time=2448] God is always there with me.
[time=2450] God is with us.
[time=2452] (audience applauding) - My name is Sue, and this is my husband, Rick.
[time=2460] Three years ago, Rick lost his job.
[time=2463] After searching for employment unsuccessfully, we felt that going the self-employment route was the best thing for us to do at the moment.
[time=2472] During this tough season, Rick began having headaches that I assumed were just part of the stress of starting a new company until the vomiting started.
[time=2482] Without insurance, it was daunting to face this, but with the doctor visits and CT scans, it confirmed a tumor on my husband's brain.
[time=2492] I was a bit nervous to see him after surgery because I didn't know what I would see or how long it would take for him to recover.
[time=2499] I walked into his room and he held out his hand to me.
[time=2502] To my surprise, there was no turban, no tubes coming out of his head, and he actually looked quite normal, sort of.
[time=2511] It wasn't until he turned his head, and I saw the bandage and the really bad haircut that I could tell he really did have surgery that day, but the most amazing thing was that he was no longer in pain, and the tumor was benign.
[time=2527] We still struggle from time to time, but we have found a new normal.
[time=2532] I like to affectionately call this period of time in our lives an adventure in trust.
[time=2538] - You know, things don't always go the way that we play on the side of heaven, but through it all, God is in control, and everything that we go through, he uses to further his kingdom.
[time=2554] Through it all, God has taken care of us.
[time=2559] - And God is with us. - And God is with us.
[time=2562] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 24 seconds]
[time=2607] - Hello, my name is Ron, and this is my wife, Alithia.
[time=2611] Early this year, I accepted God as my savior, and I made a decision to turn my life in our business over to God.
[time=2620] I had not attended church or had a relationship with our Lord for more than 40 years.
[time=2627] I thought I could do everything myself without anyone's help and without God's help.
[time=2636] Because of that, our marriage suffered, our business suffered, and our relationship with our son suffered.
[time=2645] We had worked so hard on our business that it had become our lives.
[time=2653] It came before everyone and to everything.
[time=2657] - Now I understand our God is forgiving
[time=2664] and loves us unconditionally, and we should live our lives according to his word, not our earthly desires.
[time=2673] - The Lord has always been with us,
[time=2680] and he will never leave us.
[time=2682] God is with us.
[time=2685] - My name is Darlene.
[time=2691] 16 years ago, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, which causes pain, extreme fatigue, and a number of other conditions.
[time=2702] Today I stand here as a representative, many of you, right here in our own church family, who live your lives, your daily lives in chronic pain.
[time=2713] I can tell you unequivocally that God's word has been my chief encouragement through years of seeking yet another better treatment.
[time=2725] I can't imagine living all these years without the constant love and support of my husband, Elmer, and friends who have come alongside, grieved with, and prayed for me.
[time=2737] The Bible teaches that God's power will be magnified
[time=2744] in our weakness, Emmanuel.
[time=2748] God is with us.
[time=2750] - Hi, I'm Tanya.
[time=2754] Earlier this year I was pregnant with our fourth daughter and six months into the pregnancy, we found out that my baby girl did not have all the parts that she needed to live outside of the womb.
[time=2767] About two months later, we said goodbye.
[time=2770] In our season of crisis, there were so many who sacrificed a lot to show us love and care.
[time=2779] I believe God brought one person in particular to be a significant source of healing during those weeks that seemed so foggy like a whirlwind around me.
[time=2789] Her name is Heather Blakey.
[time=2792] Heather is a professional photographer in Fort Wayne who volunteers her time and skills with a national organization called Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep.
[time=2801] While I was still pregnant, she took our family pictures and captured ultrasound screenings.
[time=2807] At the hospital, Heather took numerous pictures after Zoe was delivered.
[time=2812] At the funeral and grave side, she was there again to take breathtaking photos of the services.
[time=2818] Heather captured Zoe's life and story through her lens, journaling for me when I didn't have words to say.
[time=2825] I know these hundreds of photos have been a gift from God sent to special you for me.
[time=2833] Being able to see and remember Zoe has brought deep healing to my broken heart these past few months.
[time=2840] God is using these precious pictures to help me navigate my way through the grief.
[time=2847] I know God is with us.
[time=2849] [MUSIC - 34 seconds]
[time=2886] - Hello, my name is Wes and this is my wife Abby.
[time=2894] - Ever since I can remember, I have always wanted to be a mom.
[time=2900] My perfect plan was to have three or four kids by the age of 30.
[time=2904] A year and a half after we married, we decided it was time to add kids to our family.
[time=2909] And four years after that, we had no diagnosis, a few failed fertility attempts, and no children.
[time=2916] I realized that my plan for our family wasn't going to happen.
[time=2922] I started thinking about adoption, however, Wes hadn't.
[time=2925] - I wasn't ready to make that commitment, partly because of the financial aspect, but mostly because it was difficult for me to think of our family without biological children.
[time=2937] - God used our friends who added to their home through adoption to begin giving me a piece about doing the very same thing in our family.
[time=2945] - The adoption process was a humbling experience, but a growing one.
[time=2950] We met with one birth mom who ended up choosing another couple, and another birth mom who ended up being a scam.
[time=2957] - Instead, we got matched with the 21-year-old girl who carried our son.
[time=2962] Today, we are confident that God wanted our home to make room for Max, and we are so blessed to be his parents.
[time=2971] - God is with us.
[time=2973] - Hi, my name is Jonathan.
[time=2976] I went to church as a child with my parents, but I never really put God first in my life.
[time=2981] I asked God to help me, and He sent me in my mentor, Dave Knuth.
[time=2984] From that moment, we shared our stories.
[time=2986] I knew God sent Dave to me.
[time=2988] Through our friendship, Dave challenged me to surrender my life to the Lord, and I did.
[time=2994] Now, I still got a lot to learn, but that would never change.
[time=2997] I wake up every day happy and knowing that God is my savior.
[time=3000] He is everything to me, and most importantly, God is number one in my life.
[time=3004] God is with us.
[time=3005] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 64 seconds]
[time=3081] - Well, there I was just this past week at a place where I at times find myself as a pastor
[time=3097] and one who is trying my best to care for people in our family and their times of need.
[time=3104] I'm so grateful for Keith Moore.
[time=3106] Keith oftentimes takes care of things at the hospital when folks are sick or in trouble.
[time=3113] In this case, it was a friend of mine, a pretty good friend, in fact.
[time=3118] And I stood there at the foot of his bed down at Parkview, Maine in ICU this week and it was a complicated situation, but I just wanna tell you, he was dying.
[time=3129] He was dying right in front of us and there didn't seem to be much that they could do.
[time=3137] They were literally bringing in family quickly to say goodbye.
[time=3142] And I watched and got a mini education from a wonderful nurse who was helping me understand numbers and his heart was failing and they weren't sure.
[time=3152] And so in just a split second, family was escorted out and I felt like I was back in.
[time=3158] Remember ER?
[time=3160] I felt like I was an ER and I was, it was ICU, but it was ER all of a sudden things were getting ripped off and all of a sudden drawers were getting open and all of a sudden bags are getting hung and I didn't see it clearly, but I know at one point there toward the end, something went in him, they stuck him with something and they shoved it in there and within about two minutes, he wasn't dying anymore.
[time=3184] Whatever they did, it worked.
[time=3187] And those unbelievably bright gifted, compassionate, professional, medical people with all the gifts and training, they executed and exercised all of their skills and they saved him.
[time=3201] And I looked at him as he laid there in that state, tubes were coming out of his mouth and the body and the face and the beeping and the yelling, I thought, oh my goodness, utterly, absolutely helpless.
[time=3218] And I wanna just remind you, I know we sometimes look at each other, we sometimes live our lives without that perspective, but oh, at Christmas, be reminded that God let go of his son so his son could come and save you, you and me, helpless, desperate people, flat lining, fading, no hope.
[time=3243] Jesus, the son, Jesus, the savior,
[time=3249] he saves us and please, please do not forget, celebrate that great truth, remind your children of that great truth, share that great truth with your friends this season, we serve a God who sent his son to, among other things, save a helpless people and what a great, great truth for us to be reminded of this morning.
