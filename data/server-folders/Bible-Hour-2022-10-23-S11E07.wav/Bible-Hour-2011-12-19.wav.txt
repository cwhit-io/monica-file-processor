[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It is not very often that I get the chance to say to you on the Bible Hour, Merry Christmas.
[time=40] As you watch this, it is Sunday, December 25th, and what a joy it is to be with you on this day.
[time=46] And what a great celebration we've had this past month as we've celebrated Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=53] I hope you've been encouraged by what you've seen.
[time=55] I know you're gonna enjoy what you see today.
[time=58] I hope the word of God, as it always does.
[time=61] I hope it'll teach you.
[time=62] I hope it'll equip you.
[time=63] I hope it'll encourage you.
[time=65] And I hope as you think about Christmas and the chance that so many of us have to receive, I hope in this season you'll be willing to give as well.
[time=75] We've been showing you and talking to you about the gifts that go opportunity, this orphanage that we're in partnership with and Nairobi, these 10 special needs kids that we're trying to encourage and help as we attempt to build 10 rooms for them, rooms that they'll live in for the rest of their lives.
[time=93] And I'm so amazed at how our family and many of you have responded.
[time=98] I hope you'll continue to go to our website and watch the video that you'll find there under the Christmas with Blackhawk logo.
[time=105] Get on the Christmas with Blackhawk link and then you can see the video and there's instructions there on how you can give and how you can support our effort to send a gift this Christmas to those dear kids that will change and affect the rest of their lives.
[time=120] Hey, I also want to make a personal invitation to you to come and be with us in January.
[time=125] As you see at the bottom of the screen here, January 8th, January 15th and 22nd, a three week series that we've entitled, We Are Family.
[time=135] Family is something that you know and I know is absolutely central to God's design for his people and it's also central in this culture of ours.
[time=146] The family must be strong, the family must be solid, the family must function in the way that God designed it and so many of our problems as families and so many of the problems we see in culture are because of the breakdown of the family, the family that God made, the family that God designed and so we're gonna talk about it for three weeks, marriage, parenting and spiritual leadership in the home.
[time=171] I hope you'll come and be with us, bring some friends.
[time=174] We can't wait to be together in the new year.
[time=177] I hope you have a great last week of 2011.
[time=180] Thank you so much for your friendship and your part in the Black Hawk family and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=187] - Well, good morning everybody.
[time=190] Welcome to Black Hawk.
[time=191] It is great to have you here.
[time=192] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege and it is that privilege to serve on the team here.
[time=197] At Black Hawk, I get to spend a lot of my days with folks just like Corbin and Janice, a team that I'm very grateful for and those two, especially the work that they have done, the effort that they have made and a lot of folks who have helped them but almost 100 kids over these last several weeks getting ready for this morning and I can't wait for you to experience and see and hear all that they have prepared.
[time=225] Before we do that, I wanna just talk to you for a moment here about what you're going to hear and experience.
[time=232] It has a little bit to do with actually, it has a lot to do with priorities.
[time=239] What's a priority?
[time=242] I wonder if I just got you to think about that just for a couple of minutes.
[time=246] How would you define?
[time=247] How would you kind of make sense of that phrase, that concept?
[time=251] What's a priority?
[time=252] You know, if you go to Webster's Dictionary, it talks about an endeavor, an activity, it talks about those things in your life that you place in a position of absolute importance.
[time=268] These are priorities, those endeavors, those activities, those things that you place in a position of absolute importance over and above other things.
[time=278] And the reason that I agree with that definition is that, and I think most of you probably know this, priorities are always attached to devotion.
[time=287] Do you understand that?
[time=289] What you are fundamentally at the core of who you are, whoever you are, what you are devoted to, and we all know that we're all devoted to something, right?
[time=302] It could be a lot of different things, but the point is, whatever it is, you are fundamentally devoted to, committed to.
[time=311] You then begin to put in place priorities to help you accomplish that.
[time=317] And I know that there are many in the room today, and you would say with me that we are devoted to honoring God, we would say we were devoted to being husbands or fathers, moms or wives, we would talk many of us about the fact that we're devoted to honoring God with our families or with our business.
[time=339] And yet there are times when God allows us to kind of step back and ask ourselves the question, do our priorities really truly align with our devotion?
[time=349] You're about to meet a man who,
[time=356] in the midst of this incredible season, gets to wrestle with this question in his life.
[time=364] He sells camels, and he is going to, over the course of the next half hour or so, kind of think this thing through.
[time=373] And so I hope you'll enjoy it.
[time=375] I hope you'll laugh, I hope you'll be amazed, but I also don't want you to miss the message.
[time=380] What a great opportunity for all of us to consider these truths.
[time=384] So without any further ado, I can't wait for you to experience this, and we're so thankful that you're here Christmas with Blackhawk 2011 Camelot.
[time=394] - Hello?
[time=398] - Hey kiddo, I heard you had a break and I wanted to call him with you well in your program tonight.
[time=403] - Thanks dad, I heard you knew Jingle for the car lot today.
[time=406] It's very catchy.
[time=408] Johnny has been singing it all day.
[time=411] - Thanks, Lydia thought it up.
[time=412] So your program starts at seven, right?
[time=415] I really want to be there.
[time=417] - Don't worry, I know you'll be there if you can.
[time=419] If not, mom will video the program.
[time=422] If it was any other night, I would close up early, but this is just such a busy time of year.
[time=427] I don't know, we'll see.
[time=428] No worries.
[time=429] - Sorry, I'm just a little tired from all our practices.
[time=434] - Well, you sit down and rest well you can.
[time=437] - I may go over my lines again.
[time=439] I keep mixing them up.
[time=440] - You did it perfectly last night and I know you'll do a great job.
[time=444] I'll let you go, love ya, love ya too.
[time=447] - I'm so tired, I can fall asleep, right here.

[time=517] [MUSIC - 22 seconds]
[time=544] - Associates, are you ready?
[time=546] - Ready!
[time=548] - Ready for what?
[time=549] [MUSIC]
[time=551] - Where do we sell 'em?
[time=553] [MUSIC]
[time=556] (audience cheering) [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=573] (audience clapping) - Good morning, Associates.
[time=580] What a day at the Camelot.
[time=582] I have a feeling this is going to be one of the biggest sales days of the year.
[time=586] The census is in full swing, and Bethlehem is buzzing with travelers, and travelers mean buyers.
[time=592] Lydia, did we get the new Camel Drapings in yesterday?
[time=595] - Yes, sir, Barnabas.
[time=596] We have 50 new beautiful handmade Camel Drapings.
[time=599] - Did we get the ones with the special spill-proofed childless holders and retractable overhead shades?
[time=605] - Yes, but we have a limited quantity.
[time=608] We also received a new shipment of camels this morning.
[time=610] - Wonderful.
[time=611] What about the new brochures?
[time=613] - In the Wal-Racks, ready to go.
[time=615] Are there any new rebates or incentives to offer?
[time=618] - On some models, we're giving two sacrificial lambs back as a rebate, or 0% interest for the first year.
[time=624] - I think it's time to greet our customers.
[time=626] The top priority today should be selling camels.
[time=628] Let's make this a day to remember.
[time=630] - Hey, Dad, hey, Dad.
[time=632] Can I answer them more?
[time=633] Can I hand out the new brochures today?
[time=635] I can watch the gate for new customers.
[time=638] Please, Dad, can I, can I, Dad?
[time=640] - Okay, son, but remember to let the sales people do their job.
[time=643] - All right, people, let's sell some camels.
[time=645] (gentle music) - Good morning.
[time=652] May I help you?
[time=653] - Yes, I'm looking for something for my wife.
[time=655] I like to find a quiet camera that doesn't bite or spit with excellent manners.
[time=660] - My husband will pick the camel.
[time=661] I would like to see your finest camel drapings.
[time=664] Maybe something in a deep purple or a brilliant green.
[time=667] Oh, and lots of tassels.
[time=668] I love tassels.
[time=670] I have just the camel for you.
[time=673] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 15 seconds]
[time=696] - How are you, ma'am?
[time=697] May I help you?
[time=698] - We're not here just to see your license, and we're looking to purchase a new camel.
[time=702] - Not anything, sporty.
[time=703] My insurance is as high as it is.
[time=706] - Mom, can we get the new H2?
[time=707] I heard they're awesome.
[time=709] - The two help camel's jumping out best now it's this year.
[time=712] - Those are awesome, kills are really expensive.
[time=715] - I hope you have a lot of money, Missy.
[time=717] - Jonathan, I think you need to come with me.
[time=719] - Write this way, please.
[time=721] (gentle music)
[time=729] [MUSIC - 11 seconds]
[time=745] - Well, hello, Missy.
[time=746] - You look like a girl, I know that she won.
[time=748] - Yes, I'm looking to buy a new sports camel.
[time=751] Now, the fastest thing on four legs.
[time=753] I travel quite a bit, and I like to travel on style.
[time=755] If you know what I mean.
[time=757] - Or if you're a little old, you'll be driving a sports camel.
[time=760] - Jonathan, let's go get some brushes.
[time=763] - I have just the thing.
[time=766] We've received a new ship of Lamborghinis.
[time=769] They are incredible.
[time=770] [MUSIC - 36 seconds]
[time=808] - You got a four by a four with a chop, a chop, a four all cage, a swamp, a hooves, and a cousin camel, drapin'.
[time=819] [MUSIC - 39 seconds]
[time=862] (audience applauds)
[time=868] - Well, hello, Jabra, it's nice to see you again.
[time=873] Are you still working in the field with your father's sheep?
[time=883] We sure miss you.
[time=884] - Thanks, I still are working in the field.
[time=886] It gives me lots of time relaxing, I'm quite tired.
[time=889] Olivia, this is Ruth and Jamie Sue.
[time=892] - Jamie Sue, that's an unusual name for a shepherd.
[time=896] - Well, this is a dream.
[time=897] Sometimes things can get a little mixed up in the other land.
[time=901] - Hi, Lydia, nice to meet you.
[time=903] - Well, ain't good.
[time=904] Tell them what we all seem to not.
[time=906] - Yes, hold your camels.
[time=908] - Lydia, it's one of us here.
[time=909] - I'd like to talk to him about something.
[time=911] - Well, there was an emergency over in the service department.
[time=914] One of our trainers tried to put a camel through the eye of a needle and there was a nasty accident.
[time=920] It's like, I don't know.
[time=922] - My best, you're needed in the front of the lot.
[time=926] - Hello, Deborah, what a nice surprise.
[time=929] What brings you to town?
[time=930] - Don't you used to work here at Camalot, here at Camalot, here at-- - Okay, Jonathan, we've got it.
[time=938] - Listen, Barnabas, I just said to stop by and tell you what happened tonight.
[time=941] Oh, this is Ruth and Jamie Sue.
[time=943] - Jamie Sue.
[time=945] - I know, it's Jamie's name.
[time=946] It's all part of the dream.
[time=948] - Okay.
[time=950] - Anyway, earlier tonight we were watching the sheep.
[time=952] When all of a sudden, an angel appeared right before our very eyes.
[time=957] - I was shaking in my sandals.
[time=959] That angel just came out of nowhere and said, "Been all afraid." - Next thing we know, the whole sky became one bright light.
[time=967] - We were almost blinded, Barnabas.
[time=969] It was angels.
[time=971] They were everywhere.
[time=972] It was indescribable.
[time=974] - Well, how about that, real angels?
[time=977] - What did they want?
[time=979] What did they look like?
[time=980] - 'Cause they do and of course fly by.
[time=982] That'd be so cool.
[time=984] - They said a savior has been born in the city of David.
[time=988] Barnabas, they were announcing the birth of the Messiah.
[time=990] He's right here in Bethlehem.
[time=992] They said he would be lying in a manger.
[time=994] - And we're on our way to see him.
[time=997] - I'm telling everyone I know.
[time=999] - Barnabas, you must come see this child too.
[time=1002] - Wow, this is not the best night for me to get away.
[time=1005] - I would drop everything if I were you, feller.
[time=1009] This is a once in a lifetime deal.
[time=1012] - You can say that again.
[time=1013] - I would drop everything if I-- - Figure of speech.
[time=1018] - I wish you could have seen the angels.
[time=1021] We were scared, amazed, and speechless.
[time=1024] They were everywhere.
[time=1026] (upbeat music) - You won't believe what happened.
[time=1035] - When we were watching the sheep last night, an angel appeared before us.
[time=1042] In front, we tried to hide.
[time=1046] - Don't be afraid, the angel said, I bring good news for all the earth.
[time=1052] Then suddenly, they were everywhere.
[time=1056] Announcein' Jesus' birth.
[time=1058] [MUSIC - 21 seconds]
[time=1083] (upbeat music)
[time=1095] [MUSIC - 106 seconds]
[time=1205] (audience applauds)
[time=1212] - Good evening and welcome to Camelot.
[time=1214] May I help you?
[time=1215] - Yes, we were here earlier today in the test room with a few camels and looked at your finest camel drinkings.
[time=1221] - The census is a great excuse for vacation and some shopping.
[time=1224] - Wow, was that a little diamond or hand?
[time=1226] Poor rock, how much did it cost?
[time=1228] - My charming son, please go find Lady and ask you to get just some chocolate goat's milk.
[time=1232] Yes!
[time=1233] [MUSIC - 2 seconds] - So sorry, as you were saying?
[time=1239] - Yes, I'd like to take another look at a few of your camels that I think would be a welcome addition to my collection.
[time=1244] - We can certainly set you up.
[time=1246] Are you enjoying your stay in Bethlehem?
[time=1248] - Oh yes, we come to the city often.
[time=1250] Such a quaint little getaway spot.
[time=1252] - Although I have to say, we don't usually have such a hard time finding a place to stay.
[time=1256] We got the last room in the inn.
[time=1258] - You don't say?
[time=1259] - Well, we have seen a lot of people come through the gates today.
[time=1262] - As a matter of fact, I heard the innkeeper offering us stable to a young couple.
[time=1266] - The wife, poor thing, looks like she was on the verge of giving birth, and a stable no less.
[time=1271] I can't imagine.
[time=1272] - Really, a stable, a manger?
[time=1275] I wonder.
[time=1276] Where did you say you were staying?
[time=1278] - We were staying at the Star Hotel.
[time=1280] - Is that over on Jordan Riverway?
[time=1281] - That's correct.
[time=1282] It's right across from one of my favorite boutiques, Heavenly Tunics.
[time=1286] - Well, thank you for stopping in.
[time=1287] My assistant Lydia will set you up.
[time=1289] I hope you have a nice day in Bethlehem.
[time=1291] - Thank you.
[time=1292] It's just a little too crazy in this channel right now.
[time=1294] I'd be glad to get back to my villa.
[time=1296] - The traffic alone could drive a person crazy.
[time=1299] People, camels, donkeys, it's ridiculous.
[time=1302] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 157 seconds]
[time=1466] (audience applauding) - Lydia, you just stole her last camel draping.
[time=1474] They've been selling like hot man all day.
[time=1477] Do we have any more in the warehouse?
[time=1479] - Did you check the current inventory list?
[time=1481] - Yes, I have it right here.
[time=1482] - And according to the records, I don't know more.
[time=1487] - Oh, I should have ordered twice as many.
[time=1489] - Oh, well, take orders, I guess.
[time=1491] - We'll do.
[time=1492] - This has been a great day.
[time=1496] Sales are going quite well.
[time=1497] Thank you, God, for this census.
[time=1500] - Excuse me, sir.
[time=1501] I'm in need of some new transportation.
[time=1503] I'm afraid my camel's gone on its last journey.
[time=1506] - We can certainly set you up.
[time=1508] - I'm looking for a dependable camel that's been well-trained.
[time=1510] - You don't look like you're from around here.
[time=1512] - No, I guess you could say I'm from the East.
[time=1515] I heard you have the finest camels in town.
[time=1517] [MUSIC - 2 seconds] Whoa, I like your crown.
[time=1523] Hat, trapezy, catch right on.
[time=1525] - Ooh, seriously, dude.
[time=1530] I didn't even keep bouncing on the cam with that thing on your head.
[time=1533] - Jonathan.
[time=1535] - Let's go get more brochures.
[time=1537] - So, will you need financing?
[time=1539] Or do you plan using an instant payment?
[time=1541] - I can pay in gold, frankincense, or mer, whichever you take.
[time=1545] - Excellent.
[time=1546] Here, could you please show this gentleman around?
[time=1548] He looks like a wise man.
[time=1550] - I would be glad to.
[time=1551] Well, what brings you this way?
[time=1553] - Surely not the census.
[time=1556] - We're actually on our way to see the new king.
[time=1559] - You came to see King Herod?
[time=1561] - Interesting.
[time=1562] - No, although we did stop by.
[time=1564] We're actually on our way to see the Messiah, the newborn king.
[time=1568] We've been following a star to get to this destination.
[time=1571] - Are you talking about that star right over there?
[time=1573] - That's the one.
[time=1574] According to our calculations, it's just over a stable on Jordan River Way.
[time=1579] - I've heard about this Messiah.
[time=1580] I hope to go over there myself tonight.
[time=1582] They're really quite busy.
[time=1584] - Barnabas, you really should go over there.
[time=1587] - Yes, you really should.
[time=1589] - Yes, you're right.
[time=1590] But I also have a business to run.
[time=1592] It must be my top priority.
[time=1593] Tonight is not, how can you even think about not going?
[time=1597] We've been following that younger star for months.
[time=1599] We've come so far, he's right here.
[time=1603] You really should go see him.
[time=1606] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 57 seconds]
[time=1668] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 88 seconds]
[time=1763] (audience applauds) - Hello, how are you leaving this evening?
[time=1772] - Fantastic, I'm Brittany, and I would like to look at some of your camels.
[time=1776] My father is buying one for graduation, and I just wanna look around.
[time=1781] So do you have those hybrids that you know, eat less, and we require low maintenance?
[time=1785] - I believe we have a few of those out back.
[time=1787] - Hi, Mrs. Solomon.
[time=1790] - Well hello, Brittany, what a nice surprise.
[time=1792] What brings you to camera?
[time=1794] - I'm getting a new camera for graduation.
[time=1796] - I'm surprised my daughter isn't with you today.
[time=1798] - Dad, Dad, I'm over here.
[time=1800] - Elizabeth says she was too tired to go anywhere tonight.
[time=1804] - Hey, did you hear about that special baby being born today in this city?
[time=1808] - As a matter of fact, I have.
[time=1809] - We passed some shepherds on our way, and they told us all about the child.
[time=1813] - Yes, I spoke to someone as well.
[time=1815] It's hard to believe that the long-awaited Messiah is finally here, right here in Bethlehem, in a stable no less.
[time=1820] Are you going to see the baby?
[time=1822] - Well, it's funny you should ask.
[time=1824] I've been waiting to see if business might slow down, and we're still so busy, but perhaps.
[time=1830] Jonathan, could you please show these girls around?
[time=1832] I need to speak to Lydia.
[time=1834] - It's about time.
[time=1835] Have I got a camera for you?
[time=1837] - Lydia, do we have any more apartments tonight?
[time=1842] - We have the centurion scheduled for later this evening, other than that, we're free.
[time=1848] - Please tell him technically when we schedule.
[time=1850] Also, tell all the employees that were closing camera lot in an hour.
[time=1852] Lydia, we have more important things to do tonight.
[time=1856] - Well, hallelujah, this is just great.
[time=1858] - They're going to be so surprised.
[time=1860] Beth, Beth, wake up.
[time=1871] It's almost time to start the program.
[time=1874] Everyone's been looking for you.
[time=1875] - Wow, I fell asleep.
[time=1877] I guess I was more tired than I thought.
[time=1879] I just had the weirdest dream.
[time=1882] I'll have to tell you about it later.
[time=1883] - Well, okay, but right now you really need to get your costume on and your makeup checks.
[time=1888] - Milce Wilson was really starting the panic.
[time=1891] I'll go let her know I found you.
[time=1893] - There you are, I was worried about you.
[time=1896] - Dad, I fell asleep in the chair after we talked.
[time=1899] - Speaking of our talk, I struggled about what I should do tonight and I decided-- - You decided to close up the lot and send everyone home.
[time=1907] - That's right, how did you know?
[time=1908] - I just had a feeling.
[time=1910] - You know, I've been thinking about some of the lines you packed from the program.
[time=1913] They were a great reminder about what my priority should be.
[time=1916] - Dad, thanks for closing Cam a lot.
[time=1918] It means so much to me that you came.
[time=1920] - Did you just say Cam a lot?
[time=1922] - Oh, I meant odd a lot.
[time=1923] Remind me after the program to tell you about this dream, I just had crazy stuff.
[time=1927] - Well, you need to go get dressed and I need to go find a spot up close so I can get a great camera shot.
[time=1932] I'll be praying for you.
[time=1933] Thanks for helping me turn my focus back to the Ranger.

[time=2143] - Well, ladies and gentlemen, the first Christmas was over 2,000 years ago.
[time=2148] What a night that was.
[time=2150] Mary and Joseph had journey to Bethlehem all because of some government thing.
[time=2155] I think it was called a census.
[time=2157] Poor Mary was gigantic with child and riding on an old smelly donkey.
[time=2163] I'm sure that she was tired and wanted to rest on a comfy bed, but I'm afraid a five star hotel was not an option.
[time=2172] Just a dusty old stable with a bunch of smelly animals.
[time=2176] Jesus Christ, our Lord was born that night.
[time=2180] And all of a sudden, that simple stable became the most important place on earth.
[time=2187] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 29 seconds]
[time=2222] - This was no ordinary night.
[time=2229] Right down the road, out on the field surrounding Bethlehem, the story continues.
[time=2234] A group of lowly shepherds were hanging out, watching their flock of sheep, when all of a sudden, surprise for right before their eyes an angel appeared and said, "Do not be afraid.
[time=2246] "I bring you good news, a great joy, "that we for all the people.
[time=2250] "Today, in the town of David, "a Savior has been born to you.
[time=2254] "He is Christ the Lord." The shepherds had to straighten the town, tell everyone where the angel had said.
[time=2262] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 48 seconds]
[time=2316] - The shepherds found their way to Jesus
[time=2327] and still more were on their way.
[time=2329] There are these wise men.
[time=2331] We like to call them kings and they traveled quite a ways by camel to visit Jesus.
[time=2336] They didn't have a handy little GPS system like we do today, so God is a giant star right over Bethlehem.
[time=2344] Being wise men, they knew to follow this star and it would lead them straight to the tiny king.
[time=2350] These days, we've been little toys, rattles, and diapers to do more babies, but not these guys.
[time=2357] They brought gold, fragrances, and mer.
[time=2361] Mary must have been so surprised at these royal guys about under her child.
[time=2366] But then again, maybe not.
[time=2369] She knew that this was God's only son.
[time=2372] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 62 seconds]
[time=2442] (audience applauds)
[time=2457] The Bible says that Mary treasured this night and remembered all this incredible stuff for many years to come.
[time=2465] It was a night to remember in Bethlehem and still is today.
[time=2469] Christmas has come to me many things to many people.
[time=2473] Their party is in shopping and presents.
[time=2477] The really most important thing about Christmas is Jesus.
[time=2481] The God who loves us and his only son to our world to save us.
[time=2486] So, with all the other busy things you do this Christmas, whatever you do, don't miss the manger.

[time=2646] (audience applauds) - There you are, I see you got changed.
[time=2655] Your mom's helping Johnny get out of this camel costume.
[time=2657] I think on the way home, we should celebrate with the little ice cream.
[time=2660] - All right, Dad, can I please ride with you?
[time=2664] Johnny has been singing in here during all day and I need a break.
[time=2667] Oh, I can also tell you about this dream I just had.
[time=2670] You and Johnny were in it and Lydia and Brittany.
[time=2674] You people still here, it's over already.
[time=2678] Oh, and hey, if you have to need some reliable transportation, have I got a camera for you.
[time=2684] (upbeat music) (audience applauds)
[time=2690] [MUSIC - 90 seconds]
[time=2783] (audience applauds)
[time=2790] - Hey, just a word of encouragement to you.
[time=2792] Don't miss, don't miss the manger, don't miss it.
[time=2797] And I want to just make sure that we're clear this morning.
[time=2801] I think for the most part, maybe a lot of us in the room would understand that phrase, but I just want to make sure that we're on the same page there.
[time=2810] The manger isn't the little thing they laid the baby in.
[time=2813] When we say don't miss the manger, we mean don't miss Jesus.
[time=2818] Don't, in the midst of this season, miss Christ.
[time=2823] And Christ was given by a loving, gracious, heavenly father
[time=2829] who looked down and saw your desperate need and mind.
[time=2833] And he gives us this amazing life-changing gift.
[time=2837] And our hope today is that you wouldn't miss him, that you wouldn't miss the forgiveness, that he brings, that you wouldn't miss the peace, that he offers, that you wouldn't miss the salvation, the salvation that is found in this gift, this baby, this Jesus, our Christ.
[time=2860] And there are, I know, as I think about it, you could probably think about this with me.
[time=2864] There's probably a number of reasons why some do miss it.
[time=2869] There are some who will miss the manger this year.
[time=2871] There are folks who will miss it because of pride, pride, or busyness, however you wanna say it.
[time=2879] What I mean by that is there are some who in the midst of this season will completely blow behind the manger because they are so distracted by their own agenda.
[time=2888] There may be some of you in the room and that may be you.
[time=2893] You may be all about you.
[time=2896] It may be all about your plans.
[time=2898] It may be all about your achievement.
[time=2901] It may be all about what you've got going.
[time=2903] It may be about where you're headed, who you're seeing, what you're doing, where you're going.
[time=2908] This season may end up being about you and if this season ends up being about you, it's very likely you're gonna miss him.
[time=2916] And that's something that would just be tragic.
[time=2923] For some of you in the room, it's about busyness and pride and you and what you've got cooking and this is a chance for you to just put on the breaks and say wait a minute, is that really who I wanna be?
[time=2937] Is that really how I wanna live?
[time=2940] Do I really wanna miss him?
[time=2942] For others of you, it might not be necessarily pride or busyness, I was thinking about this and this is a hard one but I think it's worth talking about.
[time=2949] There are some in this room right here this morning who may miss the manger because of what I'll just call numbness.
[time=2956] Really truthfully, it's sad I know but there are some in the room and this all has lost it's luster for you.
[time=2965] There was a day when it was really special.
[time=2969] There was a day when you were really stirred.
[time=2971] There was a time in your life maybe where the thought of Christmas, more than the thought, the meaning of it meant something deeply to you.
[time=2979] And there are some who may miss it this year because the truth be told for you, it's just become meaningless.
[time=2985] You're numb.
[time=2987] Somehow in the midst of your disappointment, somehow in the midst of your hurt, somehow in the midst of your struggle, you have just walked away from what used to be a deep and intimate relationship that brought at this time of your great joy.
[time=3003] And so whether it's kind of this pervasive numbness
[time=3010] that may cause you to miss him or whether it's the busyness and pride of your own agenda, I wanna remind you this morning of what it says in Matthew one, 21, 22 and 23.
[time=3021] And I wanna remind you of this because he has a message for you.
[time=3025] He wants you to remember what it says.
[time=3027] She will bear a son.
[time=3028] This is the angel talking to Joseph in the night as the angel's kind of bringing comfort and direction to Joseph.
[time=3036] She will bear a son, Joseph, and you shall call his name Jesus for he will save his people from their sins.
[time=3046] Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet and what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, look at 23.
[time=3053] Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son and they shall call his name what?
[time=3059] Say it, church. - Emmanuel.
[time=3061] - Emmanuel.
[time=3062] - Emmanuel, which translated means say it.
[time=3066] God with us.
[time=3068] You may be too busy.
[time=3071] He wants to be with you.
[time=3075] You may be numb.
[time=3076] You may have distanced yourself.
[time=3079] He wants to be with you.
[time=3082] Don't miss him.
[time=3085] And whatever it might take, it might take an honest conversation with a trusted friend.
[time=3092] It may mean just coming and talking with us afterwards.
[time=3095] It may mean coming back Christmas Eve or Christmas morning and having that conversation with us.
[time=3101] We would do anything to help encourage you toward a place, a place where you wouldn't miss the very reason we've gathered, the place of accepting, the place of reconnecting, the place of enjoying and embracing Christ.
[time=3117] Amen. - Amen.
[time=3118] - Thank God for the great truth of the manger.
[time=3121] Hey and thank God as well for how at this time of year,
[time=3127] he has stirred in us over the last several years at Black Off to do our very best to give a gift.
[time=3134] To give a gift that goes far and beyond maybe what you could do or you could do or I could do.
[time=3140] We've decided over the years to collectively give above and beyond our normal offerings and at Christmas send a gift to those in need.
[time=3149] We pray every year that God would make it clear who the those in need might be.
[time=3154] And this year he has made it abundantly clear.
[time=3156] I want you to watch this video.
[time=3158] We've seen it a few times I know, but every time I see it, I'm reminded of the great privilege that God has given us this year to be a part of a gift like this that's gonna go and change lives in a significant way.
[time=3170] Watch, please and be encouraged.
[time=3173] - Kids in Africa who have special needs just love different lives.
[time=3178] - In the culture where there's extreme poverty, special needs kids are even more risk of being abandoned.
[time=3186] - First of all, they don't have the healthcare that we have here in the United States.
[time=3190] So they are not able to get the medical care that they need to help them with their disabilities.
[time=3195] - Kids with disabilities in Kenya, there's not much that can be done for them.
[time=3199] - The poverty is so bad that parents literally have to decide which children they're gonna feed.
[time=3206] And when you're a special needs child, the odds of you being abandoned and left on your own are increased even more.
[time=3216] - One of the big issues that they face is the fact that in Kenya they are often seen as an outcast.
[time=3221] People don't know what to do when they don't know how to handle kids with disabilities so they're kind of considered just an outcast to the community.
[time=3228] - There's this place, New Life Home.
[time=3230] - What I love about New Life Home, they've seen that issue and they've decided to do something about it.
[time=3237] They know that there are kids who are in their care that because of physical or mental disabilities may not get adapted and need a place to call home.
[time=3248] - They don't discriminate whether it's HIV positive or a physical handicap or a mental handicap.
[time=3254] If it's an abandoned baby, they're gonna rescue it.
[time=3258] - And they take these kids in and they show 'em love and they show 'em just what a home is like and they really take 'em in and they show God's love to them.
[time=3267] (upbeat music)
[time=3275] (singing in foreign language) - I love spending time with them.
[time=3303] They're kids that are full of joy and full of love and I think that's a result of the care that they're receiving.
[time=3310] - Being able to see God's love being shown to all these children and being able to see how wonderful this place was.
[time=3318] I was not expecting what I saw when I went.
[time=3321] - They're loved and they're respected and they're cared for as part of a family which you wouldn't want anything better.
[time=3329] - God has put the opportunity and the need in front of them to care for these special needs children for the duration of their life.
[time=3338] - What New Life Home has decided that they wanna do is to add an addition to one of their current homes and it's gonna be specifically for these kids who have special needs.
[time=3349] - This home will need to be equipped for children with wheelchairs and walkers and that are gonna need intense care.
[time=3356] So their goal is to be able to build a home that's specialized just for their needs.
[time=3361] (upbeat music)
[time=3390] - What we wanna do is build 10 rooms as part of this edition.
[time=3394] Our goal as a church family is to raise $75,000.
[time=3398] - $75,000.
[time=3400] - We get to be extravagant in our generosity and we're asking the Blackhawk family to raise $75,000 this Christmas.
[time=3408] - The mission of this project is for us to take God's money
[time=3414] and allocate it towards this project.
[time=3416] - There are so many problems and issues in this world and things that we could get behind and support.
[time=3423] But at the end of the day, the Bible talks a lot about how God has a heart for the poor and the fatherless.
[time=3430] - The children that are there are often deemed as outcasts and unadoptable.
[time=3435] And that's so contrary to God's love for us.
[time=3438] As a family, I just pray that we will be able to use the generous gifts that God has given us to be His hands and feet.
[time=3445] (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - Well, as a lot of you know,
[time=3468] we felt like a number of weeks ago that $75,000 just seemed crazy.
[time=3473] And we didn't know how all this was gonna work.
[time=3476] We still don't, but what a thrill and joy for me to be able to stand here today and tell you that with Christmas Eve and Christmas and the rest of December still to come, as of today, we got five color pictures.
[time=3488] Five rooms have been provided for so far, and that is just a huge, huge blessing.
[time=3496] [AMEN] Yeah, each room is $7,500.
[time=3501] And we're gonna just see what God does with these next five and we're gonna continue just to ask you as a family to consider what your part might be.
[time=3509] (upbeat music)
