[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It's great to be with you and I'm so thankful to get to be with you each and every week.
[time=39] We're so thankful the Word of God continues to be taught and that you continue to be encouraged by what the Word of God has.
[time=47] I tell you what, I'm encouraged these days on many fronts.
[time=50] Not the least of which is what we've seen God do through our year in compassion gift that we have entitled gifts that go.
[time=59] Most of you know that over the last several years at the end of every year we try and just do an offering and send everything that we raise to somebody, some place where there is a great need.
[time=70] This year we decided to send our gifts that go to Nairobi, to New Life Home Trust, an orphanage that we're already in a partnership with a rescue abandoned babies and many of these babies as they grow up, the folks there realize that these kids have special needs and these special needs, babies become special needs kids and they're wanting to build rooms for these special needs kids and it's an enormous task and so we committed as a church that we were gonna try and raise $75,000.
[time=103] We felt like God was leading us to at least give it a shot, to raise $75,000 above and beyond our normal offerings and we invited our whole church family to jump in with us and I'll tell you what God did through our church family and Summit Church right here in town, Pastor Al Jennings and the Summit Church family they joined in and we'll write a check this next week and we'll send the check to Nairobi and the check will be for $135,000, $100,000 more than we've ever given and I can't tell you the joy and the excitement that we're feeling today, the radical, extreme generosity of people has made it possible for 10 kids, now probably more than 10, probably 15, 16, 17 kids, we were trying to build 10 rooms.
[time=156] Now we might build 20, you never know, but the generosity has been overwhelming and we're so grateful for what this, not only provides new life home trust but we're grateful for what it says about us.
[time=170] I'm thankful for what it says about our people that in tough economic times when so many people are hoarding and keeping to themselves, we've got a people here that we're willing to open their hearts and their lives and share their resources at a level that absolutely blew us away.
[time=189] It was astounding to see what they did, little kids and high school kids and moms and dads and grandmas and grandpas willing to open up their pockets and their purses and their hearts.
[time=201] And I just want you to know, those of you in the Bible Hour audience who participated with us in this huge thanks to you.
[time=209] Thank you for your willingness to jump in and be a part of our family as we gave this gift.
[time=215] I know it means a lot to the folks over on the staff at New Life Home, it means a great deal to us.
[time=222] And again, I want you to understand we view you as part of this family and to have you participate with us like this was a joy.
[time=229] Thank you, God bless you.
[time=231] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=233] [MUSIC - 32 seconds]
[time=271] - It's crazy for that.
[time=272] (audience applauding) (gentle guitar music)
[time=286] [MUSIC - 143 seconds]
[time=439] Come on, sing it out, holy.
[time=445] [MUSIC - 94 seconds]
[time=544] Amen, praise it.
[time=546] I wish I could do that, you?
[time=557] Man, oh man, I wish I could do that, amen.
[time=560] All right, hey, we are about to, as they say, shift gears.
[time=565] And it's gonna be quite a shift, but it's gonna be a great shift.
[time=568] And I am looking forward to these next several minutes and the chance that we're gonna get to jump into this new series that we've entitled We Are Family.
[time=578] And we've been praying about this, we've been looking forward to this.
[time=581] I know there's many of you in the room this morning that have come prepared to hopefully have God speak to you on this front.
[time=586] And our hope is that He will, we've got a little video here to introduce it.
[time=590] And then I'm gonna be back and we're gonna have some fun and jump into God's word.
[time=593] So here we go, we are family.
[time=598] [MUSIC]
[time=613] You've got to be friends.
[time=615] You've got to be finally in love with each other.
[time=617] You've got to be your best friend, too.
[time=619] Willing this to listen to each other.
[time=621] Talk about the mundane things of the day.
[time=625] I think having a shared activity, like we got into swing dancing and that's something that we can depend on doing together.
[time=632] Communication.
[time=634] Oh, definitely.
[time=636] Communication.
[time=637] And consideration.
[time=640] And lots of love.
[time=645] I think a strong marriage is built on a sense of humor and learning to not take life so serious.
[time=652] I think friendship first and understanding each other.
[time=659] I think when you're friends first, you treat people different.
[time=663] So, I mean, a true friendship.
[time=666] Besides the humor, I think just being together, experiencing life, taking time to enjoy one another.
[time=674] Understanding.
[time=675] Like the couple before us, communication, you know, you have to be able to talk with each other and understand each other and...
[time=682] I think a great marriage is made from time spent together and also a great marriage is made centered on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=692] Just fight through the hard times and struggle through your relationship and make it work, you know.
[time=698] Don't give up too easy.
[time=700] Don't give up at all.
[time=702] [MUSIC - 21 seconds]
[time=727] All right, all right, here you go.
[time=729] Stand up right where you are and we're going to have some fun here.
[time=732] Don't put it past me.
[time=733] I might drop a disco ball in here next week.
[time=736] Here's what we're going to do.
[time=738] That was, we are family.
[time=739] We talked about it a couple of weeks ago.
[time=741] Not the Pointer Sisters, but who?
[time=743] Sister Sledge, 1979.
[time=745] So it got me thinking.
[time=746] I'm all into trivia and I love music and I love, you know, the '60s, the '70s, the '80s.
[time=752] I'm about to lose a bunch of young kids right here.
[time=755] But I had the team put this to get Chris and others, put this thing together on this iPad.
[time=760] I cannot believe technology.
[time=761] But we're going to play a game to get started.
[time=764] I love a little competition.
[time=766] So let's just see how you do a little trivia.
[time=768] Family related.
[time=770] Listen, family related television shows from the '60s, '70s, '80s,
[time=777] the title song from those shows.
[time=780] They're all like right here.
[time=781] I just keep going.
[time=782] Show after show.
[time=783] They got all these shows right here.
[time=785] I'm going to just press a button and the music from that show is going to start playing.
[time=790] And you're going to see if you can guess what show it is.
[time=793] And if, when I stop, if you don't know what show it is, we're on the honor system here.
[time=799] If you don't know what show it is, sit down.
[time=801] If you do, if you think you know what show it is, stay standing up and then we'll just see if you got it right.
[time=806] I could go all morning.
[time=807] There's so many, so many shows here.
[time=809] They had to cut me off for a hour.
[time=811] All right, we're going to start out easy, okay?
[time=813] We'll just start out easy.
[time=814] You ready?
[time=815] We got this thing tuned up.
[time=816] Here we go.
[time=817] [inaudible] That's all you get on that one.
[time=821] Don't say it.
[time=822] If you, if you're not, if you don't know what that is, what rock have you been under for 30 years?
[time=830] If you don't know what that is, sit down.
[time=833] Oh, wow.
[time=834] A lot of rock dwellers.
[time=835] Sit down.
[time=836] If you do think you know what that is, just kind of say it quietly.
[time=840] Go ahead.
[time=841] Say it out loud to the people around you right now.
[time=842] Say it.
[time=843] And the answer is Beverly Hillbillies.
[time=847] If you've got it, oh, if you've got it wrong, sit down.
[time=852] Oh.
[time=853] All right, kid.
[time=854] Everybody back up.
[time=855] We'll try another one here.
[time=856] We'll stay somewhat in the easy category.
[time=858] Here you go.
[time=859] [whistling] That's all you get.
[time=863] That's it.
[time=864] If you don't know it, sit down.
[time=866] If you do know it, stand up.
[time=868] Say what it is.
[time=869] [inaudible] Andy Griffith.
[time=871] I'm sorry for you if you didn't get that one right.
[time=874] We're going to pick it up a little bit here.
[time=876] This is back.
[time=877] I think this is '60s.
[time=878] This is '60s.
[time=879] So sorry teenagers.
[time=881] Bear with us.
[time=882] [MUSIC]
[time=887] Don't say it.
[time=889] We're going to lose some people right here.
[time=891] Sit down.
[time=892] If you don't know it.
[time=893] Sit down.
[time=894] If you don't know it.
[time=896] If you do know it, say what it is.
[time=899] [inaudible] Dick Van Dyke show.
[time=903] Raise your hand if you've got it right.
[time=905] Oh, you guys are awesome.
[time=907] Okay.
[time=908] Everybody back up.
[time=909] Everybody.
[time=910] Okay, here.
[time=911] We lost a lot of folks' first hour on this one.
[time=913] Here you go.
[time=914] Ready?
[time=915] Everybody up.
[time=916] Listen.
[time=917] [MUSIC]
[time=922] You're struggling right now.
[time=924] You are struggling.
[time=925] That's all you get.
[time=927] Think about it.
[time=928] Sit down.
[time=929] Oh, yeah.
[time=930] Look at dropping like flies.
[time=931] Sit down.
[time=933] We got some people who think they know what it is.
[time=934] Okay.
[time=935] Tell somebody around you what it is.
[time=938] Answer is family affair.
[time=942] Oh, sit down if you missed it.
[time=944] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[time=945] Sit down if you missed it.
[time=947] Stay standing if you got it.
[time=949] Oh, these people are brilliant.
[time=951] Give these people a hand.
[time=952] [APPLAUSE]
[time=953] All right.
[time=954] Everybody back up.
[time=955] What do we, we got to like one, right?
[time=958] We're okay.
[time=959] I'm having so much good of page two.
[time=960] Okay.
[time=961] We're going to go to page two.
[time=962] Oh, here's another good one.
[time=963] This will be good.
[time=968] Oh, don't say it.
[time=970] That's all you get.
[time=971] Sit down if you don't know it.
[time=973] Say what it is.
[time=974] If you think you know it.
[time=976] My three sons is the right answer.
[time=980] All right, everyone.
[time=981] Last one.
[time=982] Here we go.
[time=983] Last one.
[time=984] Here we go.
[time=985] One of my favorites.
[time=986] I could just sing this whole song.
[time=987] We could just make a video to it.
[time=989] It's so much fun.
[time=990] Here we go.
[time=991] We're moving on now.
[time=995] That's all you get.
[time=996] Sit down if you don't know it.
[time=998] Everybody say it out loud if you do.
[time=1001] Jefferson's.
[time=1002] There we go.
[time=1004] Give yourselves a big hand.
[time=1005] Got to love technology.
[time=1010] Yes, that was all family related television shows.
[time=1013] So get off my back if you didn't think that applied.
[time=1017] All right.
[time=1018] We are family.
[time=1020] Let me ask you a question this morning.
[time=1027] Has God ever feared an outcome?
[time=1040] I know you have.
[time=1042] I'm asking you, has he?
[time=1045] How many fights has God lost?
[time=1049] Well, it's his record.
[time=1053] How many battles has God ever walked away from?
[time=1060] Now, with that in mind, as we come to a few weeks here on the family, I want to make
[time=1066] one thing very clear that we all must understand as we go forward in this conversation.
[time=1074] You must understand and you must admit and see this to be true.
[time=1080] There is a real high stakes spiritual battle going on for your family.
[time=1089] It is a battle that is raging.
[time=1092] And the one behind it is the enemy.
[time=1094] And this battle is for you.
[time=1096] This battle is coming after them.
[time=1098] This battle is for every single member of your home.
[time=1106] The Bible teaches us that Satan has desired to have you.
[time=1112] He has desired to have you.
[time=1114] The Bible teaches that translated.
[time=1116] It means he has desired to destroy you.
[time=1120] It's what he wants.
[time=1121] That is his aim.
[time=1122] Scripture says that sin, Genesis 4, right before the Cain and Abel thing happened.
[time=1127] Scripture said that sin was crouching at the door, right before utter destruction.
[time=1135] In this case, murder God's word talks about sin, crouching at the door.
[time=1141] And my friends, sin is crouching at the door and its desire is to rule over you and your family.
[time=1152] The enemy wants families torn apart.
[time=1155] And so there is a battle going on.
[time=1160] There is a fight that is transpiring with evil.
[time=1165] And God wants to fight it for you.
[time=1167] Better said God wants to fight it with you.
[time=1170] But there is a massive problem.
[time=1174] There is a huge problem.
[time=1176] The problem is this, that sometimes in his efforts to try and help you fight this battle,
[time=1183] God ends up having to fight you.
[time=1189] Sometimes in this enormous commitment on his part to help you and me fight this battle
[time=1199] with an enemy who wants to destroy us, sometimes he ends up having to fight.
[time=1205] Not the enemy, but us.
[time=1209] I want to throw a phrase out here this morning.
[time=1212] I want you to start chewing on it.
[time=1214] I want you to start thinking about this with me.
[time=1216] The phrase is wrestling with God.
[time=1220] Wrestling with God.
[time=1222] Write that down this morning.
[time=1223] Wrestling with God.
[time=1225] You might remember God wrestling with Jacob in Genesis 32.
[time=1230] Now here is how this works.
[time=1232] Here is the long and short of wrestling with God.
[time=1235] Wrestling with God is when you or someone in your family are at odds with God's intentions.
[time=1245] When you or someone in your family is at odds with not agreeing with, not moving in the same direction as God.
[time=1255] When God wants this for you, when God has decreed, when God has commanded, when God has designed
[time=1263] that for you or for them it looked like this, but for you or for them you are going in this
[time=1270] direction in the midst of that tension.
[time=1273] Here is what happens when what he wants and what you are doing don't add up.
[time=1281] There is a fight.
[time=1284] That is right.
[time=1285] What happens is that God loves us so much that he begins to move toward us and God begins
[time=1291] to contend with us.
[time=1293] It is a great phrase.
[time=1294] He begins to contend with us and wrestle with us so that hopefully at the end of the day
[time=1300] he can have his way.
[time=1304] Now when God wrestles with us, I hope you will write these things down.
[time=1307] So many of you in the room, I know understand this.
[time=1310] So many of us in the room have experienced this.
[time=1313] There are many of you and the one standing in front of you as well.
[time=1322] We have at times in our lives gone down roads that were an absolute contradiction to his
[time=1329] intentions for us.
[time=1332] And when we are in that spot and when God is wrestling with us, there are some things that happen when God wrestles with us.
[time=1340] He burdens our hearts.
[time=1341] Write that down.
[time=1342] He burdens our hearts.
[time=1346] God makes it so that down in our heart we just know there is this feeling.
[time=1351] There is this heaviness.
[time=1353] There is this burden.
[time=1354] We just know it is not it, whatever it is we are doing, wherever it is we are going.
[time=1359] We just know in our hearts it is not right.
[time=1364] There is a burden that comes at the heart and soul level.
[time=1368] When God wrestles with us because of his great love for us, he afflicts our minds.
[time=1376] Write that down.
[time=1377] He afflicts our minds.
[time=1379] You see this time and time again with David in the Psalms as he writes.
[time=1385] There are times when because of our sin.
[time=1390] There are times when because of our movement away from what God is intending.
[time=1395] That even mentally, let alone at the heart level but mentally there begins to be this unsettledness.
[time=1402] Somebody once described it as being unable to even think straight because God's spirit
[time=1410] and God's word is so messing with our current thinking.
[time=1417] He burdens our hearts.
[time=1418] He afflicts our minds.
[time=1420] He convicts our will.
[time=1422] He does when he wrestles with us and he may be wrestling with you this morning.
[time=1426] He brings conviction on your will.
[time=1430] The will is that place deep in you where decisions get made, where stuff gets thought through and you start going down this road or that road when the conviction of the Holy Spirit
[time=1441] and the word of God comes, we increasingly know we may not admit it but in all honesty.
[time=1448] If we could, we would, we increasingly know things aren't right.
[time=1453] Deep inside of us we know conviction brings this knowledge we know.
[time=1460] God is right and we know that we are what?
[time=1464] Say it wrong.
[time=1467] We just know.
[time=1472] He burdens our hearts.
[time=1473] He afflicts our minds.
[time=1474] He convicts our will.
[time=1477] You know what else he does?
[time=1479] Sometimes.
[time=1480] You've seen it.
[time=1484] I've experienced it.
[time=1486] He disciplines us.
[time=1490] Scriptures teach that God disciplines his children.
[time=1493] What do we mean by discipline?
[time=1495] Well, it's a, there's no cookie cutter thing on this.
[time=1498] You know what?
[time=1499] Hard, painful, crazy stuff starts happening.
[time=1504] You get really sideways as God through his discipline in your life or mind begins to up
[time=1511] the ante on getting our attention.
[time=1515] Now that's a confusing principle at times because the truth of the matter is that sometimes really hard things happen to people who aren't being disobedient.
[time=1524] Do you understand that?
[time=1526] There are times when difficult things happen to good people.
[time=1530] We can talk about that another time.
[time=1532] Here we're talking about the fact that God does move in this way at times with those who
[time=1538] aren't choosing and moving down roads that match up with his intentions.
[time=1544] He burdens our hearts.
[time=1545] He afflicts our minds.
[time=1546] He convicts our will.
[time=1548] He disciplines us.
[time=1550] All of the above leading to immense tension, turmoil, and heartache until God has his way,
[time=1558] until you say or until I say uncle.
[time=1563] I said that to a young person recently and they looked at me like I was from Mars.
[time=1568] Nobody understands that phrase anymore.
[time=1570] And the youth culture of today would be like saying until we tap out.
[time=1576] I'm thinking about the ultimate fighting and those guys in the ring saying I give.
[time=1580] Tapping out means I'm done.
[time=1583] You win.
[time=1586] And he's going to keep burdening and he's going to keep afflicting and he's going to keep convicting and he's going to keep disciplining until you tap out.
[time=1594] And until somebody says uncle, you win.
[time=1599] You're right.
[time=1601] I'm wrong and I know it.
[time=1603] And I need to move in the right direction.
[time=1606] Until you yield burden, affliction, conviction, and discipline continue.
[time=1611] Some would say to that, some would say how cruel.
[time=1614] What a cruel God they would say.
[time=1617] If they were just listening to me explain the last five minutes there.
[time=1620] And I would say to that the exact opposite.
[time=1624] I would say are you kidding me?
[time=1626] How loving?
[time=1628] How loving that a God would love you and me and put up with us for so long through so much.
[time=1636] And in the midst of our willful rebellion, continue to faithfully just keep knocking and just
[time=1643] keep shoving and just keep pushing and just keep saying, oh, please.
[time=1648] How cruel?
[time=1649] I don't think so.
[time=1651] How loving of him.
[time=1655] I said it like this first hour.
[time=1656] God loves us so much.
[time=1658] He'll fight for us.
[time=1660] God loves you so much.
[time=1661] He'll fight for you.
[time=1664] And even if he has to, he'll even fight with you in his efforts to bring you to that place
[time=1672] of obedience, why?
[time=1675] Why?
[time=1676] I was thinking about that this week.
[time=1678] Why is God so committed?
[time=1681] Why does it mean so much to him that he would continue to wrestle with and contend with
[time=1687] you or with me day after day, week after week, month after month, sometimes year after year?
[time=1693] What is it that motivates him besides his great love?
[time=1697] Well, one thing that I know motivates him is Jeremiah 29, 11.
[time=1701] Jeremiah 29, 11 says, I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord.
[time=1708] Do you see that?
[time=1709] I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord plans to give you a future and a what?
[time=1717] See, sometimes church, we just need to sit back and maybe today it's time for you to sit back and be reminded of this.
[time=1725] God, the God of the universe, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, God has a remarkable, divinely
[time=1734] orchestrated plan for your life, for your family.
[time=1741] It is a, listen, it is a phenomenal, perfect plan.
[time=1746] Here you go, it's better than yours.
[time=1750] [AMEN] Did you hear me?
[time=1754] Much, much better than yours.
[time=1755] Since that day and eternity passed when he set his love on you, he's had a plan for you.
[time=1762] He wants to bless you.
[time=1763] God wants to prosper you.
[time=1765] He wants to grow you.
[time=1766] He wants to refine you.
[time=1768] And there's pain and joy in that whole process.
[time=1771] Psalm 8411, Psalm 8411, the second part of that verse says, no good thing.
[time=1776] It says he withhold from those who walk, what, say it, uprightly.
[time=1784] He's got a, he has a plan for you and for your family.
[time=1790] And no good thing, no good plan.
[time=1794] Will he withhold from those who walk uprightly?
[time=1797] And if you're not walking uprightly, he will, God will, fight you.
[time=1805] He will wrestle with you.
[time=1808] He will contend with you for your sake and for your family's sake.
[time=1813] Amen?
[time=1814] So with this family, so with this family series in mind, we've selected three aspects of the
[time=1822] family experience.
[time=1824] We've kind of just pulled out three spiritual endeavors, very related to God honoring family,
[time=1833] three things that you might, that you might not be walking uprightly in.
[time=1841] Marriage, parenting, spiritual leadership in the home.
[time=1846] Now you might be kicking tail and taking names on all three fronts, great if you are.
[time=1854] Seriously, good job.
[time=1856] Keep learning.
[time=1857] Don't tune us out.
[time=1858] Keep listening.
[time=1859] Believe me, the day will come when you won't be.
[time=1862] And you'll need these truths.
[time=1865] But if you're not walking uprightly in these areas, if you may have strayed from them,
[time=1874] then there's a good chance that the God of the universe, who's never feared an outcome or walked away from a battle, may be coming after you and your family.
[time=1885] Why?
[time=1886] Because he loves you.
[time=1888] Marriage, parenting, spiritual leadership in the home, this will mark our Sunday teaching
[time=1896] times throughout the rest of this month.
[time=1899] And so we begin this morning and we start our series with marriage, with marriage.
[time=1906] Just like God did.
[time=1907] Do you ever think about that?
[time=1909] You ever noticed that?
[time=1910] We're going to start with marriage just like God did.
[time=1913] God started with marriage.
[time=1914] That's right.
[time=1915] You ever noticed in Genesis 1 and 2, after creation, what's the very first thing he establishes
[time=1925] in all of mankind and all of human history, when the whole thing gets going, what's the
[time=1931] very first thing God does?
[time=1935] He establishes marriage.
[time=1938] He brings a man and a woman, good to be reminded of that today.
[time=1946] God's design is for a man and a woman to come together in a thing that he called marriage,
[time=1956] one flesh, one union together to bring glory and honor to him.
[time=1964] And I want to just say this at the outset, so many places to go to kind of start this discussion.
[time=1970] So I'm going to pick one and we're going to jump in right here as it relates to marriage, as it relates to family.
[time=1975] Let me just say this.
[time=1976] It'll be on the screen.
[time=1978] It'll discourage some.
[time=1979] It'll encourage others.
[time=1980] But let me just say it and then we're going to talk about it for a little bit.
[time=1983] As it relates to the health of and hope for your family, if you don't get the marriage,
[time=1993] if you don't get the marriage piece right, and by right I don't mean perfect.
[time=1998] By right I mean growing in the right direction.
[time=2003] If you don't get the marriage piece right, then any health and hope your family might experience begins to dwindle drastically.
[time=2015] Suffice to say marriage is centrally important and placed in the middle of this thing called
[time=2022] family.
[time=2023] And there are, listen, I'm not being mean, I'm not being cruel, I'm not being judgmental,
[time=2029] I'm just saying to you and I'm saying to me, if you have a bad, not honoring God marriage,
[time=2039] bad marriages don't produce fruitful families.
[time=2046] It just doesn't work that way.
[time=2050] It doesn't, really unhealthy marriages that don't honor God tend to impact their families
[time=2056] in a very negative way.
[time=2060] Now, I just discouraged a whole number of groups of people, those of you divorced and remarried,
[time=2072] those of you divorced and not remarried, and those of you in the room really, really struggling.
[time=2079] You could read that and go, well thanks, I guess there's no hope for us.
[time=2085] No, not to the contrary.
[time=2089] Listen, let me say this, let me say this, if you're here today and you're divorced,
[time=2095] if you took a stab at this thing and for whatever reason, you know, it did not work out.
[time=2100] If you're divorced and remarried and you're here in this room this morning or you're listening
[time=2106] or you're watching on the broadcast, here's my encouragement to you.
[time=2110] My encouragement to you is get this one, the marriage that you're in, get this one right.
[time=2117] Put aside your pride, fill yourself with humility and wisdom from God,
[time=2124] get on your knees and beg him for help and stop at absolutely nothing
[time=2130] to learn from your past spiritual and personal failures.
[time=2135] I want to say to you this morning, if you're here and you're divorced and remarried, Jeremiah 2911 applies to you still, God still has a plan for you,
[time=2145] and you can still experience with God's help all that He had plans to give you a future and a hope.
[time=2153] I don't want you to focus on your past failure.
[time=2156] What I'd invite you to do now is focus on your current opportunity to learn from Him and do this the way He designed it to be done.
[time=2168] Now, if you're divorced and not remarried, then you get to continue to work on you and your ongoing journey of spiritual growth.
[time=2176] It's okay not to be married.
[time=2178] Listen to everything we touch on from God's word over these next few weeks and keep allowing God and His Word and His Spirit to change and transform you.
[time=2188] If you're divorced and you've got kids, if you're still involved in family, which is what this is about here for these next few weeks, if there's kids that you're involved with, then throw yourself completely at the God-honoring principles that we'll be studying.
[time=2203] And in doing so, you can help instead of hinder the process
[time=2209] and the plans that He has for your family.
[time=2214] And now to those of you in the room this morning that find your marriage quite possibly on its last breath.
[time=2225] And I know that you're here.
[time=2229] In some cases, I know you.
[time=2232] And I understand your struggle.
[time=2233] There are others of you here today who find yourself at this place and I don't know you.
[time=2238] But I know your struggle because you're no different than me.
[time=2243] And there are those in this room.
[time=2246] And to you today, the truth is your marriage feels and looks really, really bad.
[time=2254] I mean, it feels utterly hopeless.
[time=2259] You would say probably if you were able to just say it, that you're absolutely near the end.
[time=2268] If we were assessing your marriage medically, we'd say you're nearly at flatline.
[time=2276] And I thought about that late last night, I was thinking about flatline, and I thought, man, if it wasn't so late, I'd call on.
[time=2284] I'd call some doctor friends of mine.
[time=2287] And I began to think about those paddles they use in the ER, you know, clear,
[time=2294] and they put those paddles on the chest cavity of someone who has flatline.
[time=2300] Their heart has stopped and they are dead.
[time=2304] And I thought about just that picture in my mind of the boom, and the body pops up and all of a sudden the lines start going.
[time=2311] And I thought, man, I wish I had some paddles.
[time=2313] I could show the folks tomorrow morning.
[time=2315] And then I woke up this morning thinking, I don't want the paddles.
[time=2319] I want to just show them this.
[time=2323] I want to just like walk across the stage, and I want to say to you in the room who are near the end, utterly and absolutely on the verge of flatline, here's my paddle.
[time=2337] Here is the life-giving word of God, a God who loves you and designed marriage, he designed it in a way for it to work.
[time=2346] And not only does this kind of function in the illustration as the paddle,
[time=2352] but I also want to just remind you lovingly, without judgment or criticism, I want to just remind you that you're where you are today, almost flatline, because guess what? You've ignored this.
[time=2367] This is what you need.
[time=2369] His design for marriage and what he has offered you here is what you need.
[time=2374] Here is what can bring life. Here is what can bring you back.
[time=2377] It is not hopeless. It doesn't have to die.
[time=2380] There is a way in which he can, and his word can, and his spirit can, and his people coming alongside can help save what you think is utterly gone.
[time=2395] And there are people in this room right now who I could have stand up,
[time=2403] and I could just show you them, and I could tell you their story,
[time=2410] almost corpses, now alive, not perfect, but we didn't bury them.
[time=2420] And so whoever you are and wherever you're at, I want you to understand there is great hope as we come to this series and the opportunity as it relates to your marriage, to impact your family in a way that really, really moves the whole thing toward what God designed and created you and your family for.
[time=2442] So we start with marriage, and as we come to marriage this morning, I want to start with the guys. We're going to start with husbands, and I want you to see the making marriage better.
[time=2452] If you go back to that slide, Katie, we just entitled it, "Making marriage better," and "Betters" in quotes, because I want to just say this real, real simple, real practical, but I want to make sure you hear me articulate this.
[time=2463] I think sometimes the problem we get into with marriage, and when we teach on or talk about marriage or you watch DVDs or you go to a seminar, sometimes we want marriage to be perfect.
[time=2474] Sometimes we're so discouraged with how the marriage is, sometimes we're so acutely aware of its downfalls and its downsides and our failure in the midst of it. We want to hear something, we want to apply ourselves to some teaching that's going to absolutely clear it all up and make it everything God desired it to be, so we can finally be fully and completely happy. Amen?
[time=2497] Listen, that's not going to happen.
[time=2501] But what can happen, listen, what can happen is that you can, I can't give you in a few weeks everything God says about marriage.
[time=2510] I'm going to give you guys, and I'm going to give you ladies just a couple of principles, and here's my invitation to you.
[time=2517] My invitation to you is wherever you are on the continuum.
[time=2521] If you're back here needing the paddles, or if you're actually doing pretty well, I just want you to get a little bit, what, a little bit better.
[time=2530] And I think it's more practical, I think it's more doable, and I think it's healthier for you and I just to say, you know what God here, give us a couple of things that we could really sink our teeth into and help my marriage get a little bit better.
[time=2545] And then we're going to go down the road a little bit, and we're going to hopefully make it a little bit better, and we're going to make it a little bit better after that, and you're going to keep growing, and it's not going to be one fell swoop, one big shot, it's going to be day by day, week by week, month by month, making marriage better.
[time=2564] Husbands, men, we are going to start with the guys first today for absolutely no deep spiritual meaning.
[time=2574] There is nothing behind, some of you are sitting there going, "Hmm, I wonder why he's starting with the men." No reason, I think husbands, H comes before W, I guess, I don't know.
[time=2588] There's no reason, I just think we should start.
[time=2591] God kind of, yeah, God started with the guy, and we're going to just start with the men.
[time=2597] If you pushed me for a reason, maybe I would say, guys, I think it's sometimes better to just take all the pain first and then move on, so let's let the Word of God convict us, let's let the Word of God teach us, let's let the Word of God show us our weaknesses, let's let the Word of God help us.
[time=2614] First Peter, chapter three, would you look there with me?
[time=2617] Peter, chapter three, first six verses are reserved for the wives, and then comes this one verse, in verse seven, that aims directly at God's design for the husband, and it says this, "You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman, and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life so that your prayers, men, will not be what, hindered.
[time=2653] You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way,
[time=2659] I want to show you three things quickly, then we'll just come back to this next week, move on to some more with the guys, and then we'll end next week with two great principles for the wives." Okay, here you go, first of all, what does it say there at the very beginning?
[time=2673] "You husbands," what, say it out loud, next few words, in the same way.
[time=2679] "You husbands in the same way," what does that make you think?
[time=2685] When you see that you husbands in the same way, what is in the same way, where does it take you in your mind?
[time=2694] Does it take you forward, or does it take you back?
[time=2698] He's saying, in essence, in light of what I've just said,
[time=2704] you husbands in the same way.
[time=2708] Now, this is going to rock a lot of guys' boats, but it's okay, we'll rock the boat.
[time=2715] Hughes Corporation, 1972, in case you didn't know that one.
[time=2719] Listen, and that was not on the iPad.
[time=2726] Go back to, here's what we mean by, in the same way.
[time=2729] Go back to 1 Peter, this is the beauty of God's Word, and in the beauty of kind of learning how to study it.
[time=2734] Go back to 1 Peter 2, 13.
[time=2737] You go back to 1 Peter 2, 13, and an entire section of this book
[time=2744] begins to teach on, listen, begins to teach on, and deal with the issue of submission.
[time=2751] Bringing oneself under, bringing oneself to a place of
[time=2757] subjugation two, bringing oneself under the authority, or rule, or leadership of another.
[time=2765] And way back in 213, God's Word to the believers was this, submit yourselves to the government.
[time=2773] And what we learn as we study that was that, yes, he wanted them to submit themselves to the government, but the submission to the government was really, because the government was whacked at times.
[time=2785] The government was crazy at times.
[time=2787] Some of these government folks wanted these believers dead.
[time=2791] So the point was, yes, you're submitting yourself to the government, but truly in doing so, you're submitting yourself to who?
[time=2800] To God.
[time=2801] Then he goes on to employers.
[time=2803] And he said, there's employers who aren't going to treat you well.
[time=2806] But I want the body of Christ, the people of God, to submit themselves to employers.
[time=2812] And there are some who mistreat.
[time=2814] It even goes into persecution and those who persecute you.
[time=2818] I want you, God says, to submit to them.
[time=2821] You come under them.
[time=2824] Then he gets to chapter three, verse one to six.
[time=2827] Guess what he tells the wives?
[time=2829] And too many times, there's too many men, too quick to answer this one.
[time=2833] But see, it's all in the context.
[time=2836] He says to wives the same thing, submit yourselves to who?
[time=2841] To your husbands.
[time=2842] He has given you wives husbands to lovingly, sacrificially, Ephesians five will get there.
[time=2850] Love you and lead you and care for you.
[time=2853] And wives, you are to submit to them.
[time=2856] But in the submission to the husband, you're really submitting yourself to who?
[time=2859] Say it.
[time=2860] God, because you're trusting him ultimately.
[time=2862] Because can you trust a man completely?
[time=2864] To be perfect?
[time=2866] No.
[time=2867] But in God's design, this is how he has drawn it up.
[time=2871] So now we come to three, seven.
[time=2873] And he says, you husbands in the same way.
[time=2879] Submit.
[time=2882] And you say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[time=2884] I was always taught.
[time=2885] She was supposed to submit.
[time=2886] Well, you know what?
[time=2887] You were taught wrong.
[time=2889] She's not the only one.
[time=2891] God's word calls us in this passage to be husbands who are willing to absolutely and thoroughly bring ourselves under the law of God for us as men in marriage.
[time=2907] Let me read this to you from the notes down here at the bottom of my Bible.
[time=2911] Though not submitting to his wife as a leader, because God hasn't called the wife to lead.
[time=2920] He's called the husband to lead lovingly and sacrificially.
[time=2924] Though not submitting to his wife as a leader, a believing husband must submit to the loving duty of being sensitive to the needs, the fears and feelings of his wife.
[time=2937] In other words, a Christian husband needs to subordinate his needs to hers at times.
[time=2943] Whether she is a Christian or not, Peter specifically notes here in this passage, consideration, civilry and companionship.
[time=2954] In the same way, there is to be a submissive spirit about you husbands.
[time=2962] There's willing and ready to come under the rule of Christ and the word of God.
[time=2968] And that coming under develops in you and she'll see it and they'll see it.
[time=2974] It develops in you this humility.
[time=2977] There is this thoughtfulness and there is this sensitivity to when a man by God's decree positions himself submissively in the role of leader.
[time=2990] It says in three seven, you husbands in the same way, live with your wives.
[time=2996] Stop, stop at live with.
[time=2999] Listen, real quick here.
[time=3002] God's word says to you husbands this morning.
[time=3005] Listen, he says that you are to live with.
[time=3009] You're to live with your wife.
[time=3014] I realize that this may sound obvious or assumed, but please don't miss this.
[time=3021] A God honoring husband, a God honoring husband is with her.
[time=3029] Now this word, this with word, it doesn't mean, it doesn't mean, guys, it doesn't mean, come on.
[time=3037] Of course I'm with her, dude, we're married.
[time=3042] I mean, I'm with her.
[time=3044] No, it's not what this is saying.
[time=3047] This isn't saying that you've got a ring and you make a house payment and you're with her.
[time=3053] No, this is talking about being with.
[time=3056] This is talking about proximity.
[time=3058] This is talking about closeness.
[time=3059] This is talking about together.
[time=3061] This is talking about you with her.
[time=3066] If you watch some of us, guys, at times you'd think we were just renting a room.
[time=3075] Sometimes that's the extent of the width.
[time=3079] And that isn't how God designed it.
[time=3084] And you might say to me, "Well, Kelly, you know, back up a little bit there, but I work a lot.
[time=3088] You know, I've had guys say to me, you know, I work crazy hours to give her and the kids a life.
[time=3094] And I want to just, on the one hand, I want to compliment you for your work ethic.
[time=3100] And on the other hand, I want to just remind you that her and the kids don't really need a life, they need you.
[time=3107] They need a lot of you, your presence.
[time=3114] I know you have to go to work.
[time=3116] I applaud that effort and I hope you work hard.
[time=3119] And I hope God blesses that hard work and allows you to provide for your family.
[time=3123] But make no mistake, in his design, what he cares about most is that you live with them.
[time=3131] Now, you might need some help like I need help oftentimes figuring that out.
[time=3137] I don't stand here and try to make that sound to you like it simple.
[time=3141] The truth is simple.
[time=3143] The application of it, we may need to talk.
[time=3147] You may need some wise counsel and guidance.
[time=3149] I hope you'll seek that out.
[time=3152] What he might say, men have said to me, well, you know what, Kelly?
[time=3155] It's just better this way, you know, the distance between us.
[time=3160] It just works out better.
[time=3161] She's hard to be with.
[time=3167] They'll say that.
[time=3168] She's hard to be with.
[time=3169] So the distance kind of works out.
[time=3171] Now, there may be things that she's doing that make her hard to be with.
[time=3178] We'll talk about that next week, okay, ladies?
[time=3183] But I would say to you husband who makes that comment, I would say to you today, this week,
[time=3190] I would say to you there might be a reason she's hard to be with.
[time=3195] And you might want to hold up a mirror and you might want to think some of these things through
[time=3201] a submissive, humble, serving spirit that as a pattern is with her, not detached from or
[time=3211] distant from her.
[time=3215] In the same way, live with your wife in an understanding way, understanding women.
[time=3223] And aren't I glad that it's 1206?
[time=3227] We will come back, we will come back to this.
[time=3230] I'll leave you with this, listen, listen, I'm going to leave you with this.
[time=3236] The Old Testament word, this is fascinating.
[time=3240] It is a challenge.
[time=3241] I'm not, this is not a comedy routine here, okay?
[time=3244] Listen, men and women are utterly, unbelievably, drastically different.
[time=3256] And I have been married to a really good one for 24 years.
[time=3262] And I feel like I have been, oh, listen, listen, I have, thank you, thank you.
[time=3266] But I feel like on this front, still, I feel like an utter failure at times.
[time=3271] And listen, it's just really hard to do, to be a man and understand her is challenging.
[time=3281] And I want to just cut to the chase real quick, we'll talk more about it next week.
[time=3284] But listen, guys, it is impossible without who, without him.
[time=3291] If you think for a moment that you're going to get anywhere near understanding her without
[time=3297] divine intervention, you are crazy.
[time=3301] You can't.
[time=3303] There's no workshop I can send you to there is no book you can read.
[time=3308] You need God's help.
[time=3311] So do you think for a moment that somehow you can be in this relationship and not walk with him?
[time=3317] Oh, guys, if we're not walking with him, gleaning his wisdom and his understanding, we will
[time=3325] fall so painfully short.
[time=3330] The word for, did you know this, the word for woman in Genesis, where it says that God
[time=3337] created woman, it's the same word in the Hebrew, used later in the Old Testament where he talks
[time=3344] about the creation of the temple, the temple of God and all of its intricacies and all
[time=3353] of its specifics and all of its figures and all of the way it was supposed to be set up,
[time=3361] the way it was supposed to work, the way it was supposed to look, the way it was supposed to be built, complicated, but beautiful, a work of God, a work of art, like a weaker
[time=3376] vessel.
[time=3377] Gosh, so many women take such issue with that here in 1 Peter 3, 7, they feel like it's some slam on their IQs or their abilities to relate, no, no, no, no, that weaker vessel,
[time=3389] that word there is the word in the Greek that talks about it would be the same word that would be the equivalent of fine china.
[time=3399] And what do we do with fine china, do we dismiss it, do we see it as nothing, no, no, we won't
[time=3406] even put it in the dishwasher.
[time=3409] We take such good care of it, ladies, don't be offended by what God says here, this is a call for a man to treat you with the gentleness and the kindness and the care that you richly
[time=3421] deserve because of how God made you like a temple.
[time=3427] So come back and we'll talk more about these things.
[time=3429] Would you stand and let me pray for you this morning, can't wait to keep looking at the family.
[time=3435] We are family.
[time=3437] Father in heaven, we stand before you today.
[time=3440] So many of us in the room in need of your help and your guidance.
[time=3446] So many of us in the room wanting to be husbands and wives that would be able to influence a family in the way God that you designed.
[time=3454] Oh, God, we need your help and your strength.
[time=3456] There may be many in the room this morning who want a fresh start.
