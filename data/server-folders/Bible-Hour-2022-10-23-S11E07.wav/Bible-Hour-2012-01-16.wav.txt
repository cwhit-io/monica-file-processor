[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, good morning, everybody.
[time=32] Welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] My name's Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Black Hawk Ministries, and we have had the privilege over this past week to be starting what is a new series here at Black Hawk on Sunday mornings, a new teaching series that we've entitled We Are Family.
[time=51] That's right, if there was ever a topic from God's word
[time=57] that had more relevance and more importance for the lives of those in our culture today, I can't think of one more pertinent than the one of the family.
[time=67] What God's word has to say to husbands, what God's word has to say to wives, the truth in the scriptures pertaining to parenting, the whole idea of spiritually leading in a home and investing spiritual truth into the lives of our next generation.
[time=85] These are the things that I know in my heart, and I think most of you know in your hearts, deep down inside, that we desperately need.
[time=93] And so I want to invite you this morning to not only listen to today's message about husbands and wives and making marriage better.
[time=101] I want you to go back to last week's message if you missed it.
[time=104] I want you to mark on your calendar or put into your iPhone or somehow remind yourself that next Sunday morning you need to be here.
[time=114] You need to come and join us live and in person.
[time=118] If nothing else, make sure you don't miss next week's broadcast, but I want to just encourage you, whoever you are, whether you're a part of the Bible hour viewing audience or this is the first time you've ever joined us, I want to encourage you to take advantage of these next three weeks and allow God's word and allow the Spirit of God to truly encourage you, maybe even correct you if needed and help you understand the way God designed the family and marriage and parenting to work, I know I need it.
[time=149] And I think many of you do as well, I hope you'll come and be a part of what God's doing here at Blackhawk as he infuses his truth into our families.
[time=159] We're so grateful for you, so thankful for the chance to be an encouragement to you on a regular basis.
[time=165] And I hope today's message will do that.
[time=167] I hope it will encourage and remind you.
[time=169] Hey, God bless you.
[time=170] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=172] And as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=513] Well, some sobering statistics and truths about where marriage has gone in our culture and then some great hope there at the end from Ephesians 5. This is week two of We Are Family. And if you were with us last week, you know that Sister Sledge and the song there from 1979 just kind of got us in a trivia mood. So we had the team put together some songs
[time=535] from the 70s, 60s, maybe even 80s from TV shows that had to do with families. And so we're going
[time=542] to do this again. Everybody in the room stand up. If you want to play just a couple of minutes here, we won't take long. But let's see how you're doing on your memory as it relates to television show theme songs having to do with families. I'm going to try and do this in the
[time=556] same order that I did at first hour. I think I started with an easy one. It was right here.
[time=562] Oh, oh, oh, oh. How come we're not in here, but that's not plugged in. That's why I think we'll
[time=569] try to get to the story of a love game. All right, that's all you get. Sit down if you don't know it.
[time=575] Sit down if you don't know it. That shocks me to see people sitting down. All right, go ahead and say it. That's easy. Brady Bunch, you're all very, very good. Everybody stand back up.
[time=585] And then I think we're going to go to a little bit of a tougher one. Where did I go? I went from Brady Bunch to here we go. A little bit older. See who can get it.
[time=593] No, I don't say it. Don't say it.
[time=598] That's all you get. Sit down if you don't know it. Sit down if you don't know it.
[time=605] I see we lost a few young ones there. All right, if you think you know it, say it quietly to somebody around you. Go ahead and say it. Commit yourself. Answer is,
[time=615] leave it to Beaver. Sit down. Sit down if you didn't get it. All right, everybody stand back up.
[time=621] Everybody stand back up. Okay, yeah, here's a favorite in our home.
[time=627] Don't say it out loud. Everybody's standing up. Here we go.
[time=634] Oh, it just makes your heart kind of go pitter-pat. Don't say it.
[time=637] Oh, yeah, that's all you get. Sit down if you don't know it.
[time=642] Go ahead, be honest. Sit down if you don't know it. And if you think you do know it, say it.
[time=647] Little House on the Prairie. Sit down if you missed it.
[time=651] Little House on the ProK. Last one. Last one. Absolutely. No way in the world
[time=662] more than 20 people get this. Okay, first hour it was absolutely just nobody.
[time=667] Few people. Here we go.
[time=670] That's it. Sit down if you don't know it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. See that? Sit down if you don't know it.
[time=686] Yeah, that's exactly what I thought. Answer is? God, you guys, you guys are amazing.
[time=692] Lost in space. Lost in space. The family's name was the who? The Robinson's. You all need to get a life.
[time=703] All right, here we are. Week two, we are family. We started last week with making marriage
[time=712] better. And we're going to continue this morning before we get back into marriage. I want to give you the bigger picture principle that we started with last week and that bigger picture principle that I hope you'll write down again this morning as we start is this idea of
[time=728] wrestling with God. Wrestling with God. And the reason we say that is the scriptures teach us
[time=737] and give us a picture of our God, a loving God who is so devoted to the plan that he has for your
[time=745] life that there are times with you and there are times with me and there are times with our families
[time=752] where in the midst of our compromise and our disobedience he comes after us. God in his loving
[time=761] pursuit comes after us. He wants us so desperately to understand and see what he wants for us
[time=768] that he will contend with us. He will fight with us. He will wrestle with us like he did
[time=776] Jacob. So we will in due time see his will. Wrestling with God. And we went on from that last week to
[time=785] say that probably probably in a room this size with this many people there are probably some husbands
[time=792] and there are probably some wives and there are probably some families as it relates to marriage
[time=799] parenting and spiritual leadership in the home who just might be missing the mark. And in missing
[time=808] the mark God just might be wrestling with you these days as he tries his best to bring you
[time=815] back to a place of what it looks like to be married to be a parent to give spiritual leadership in the
[time=821] home in the way that he designed. So husbands we started with you last week first Peter chapter
[time=828] three verse seven. Let me read it to you we're going to kind of quickly make our way through where we were last week so we can get to more truth and more principles this week first Peter three seven. It says you husbands in the same way live with your wives in an understanding
[time=844] way as with someone weaker some translations may read a weaker vessel since she is a woman
[time=851] and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life so that your prayers will not be
[time=859] hindered. And I want to start this morning right there at the end of that verse. I don't want any
[time=866] husband in this room to skip over that last phrase too quickly. We're going to move on to other
[time=874] principles this morning but I have got to at least say to you this morning as a husband
[time=881] I believe that God put that in his word. I believe that that last statement
[time=887] is worth thinking about. I believe it's true and I believe if you read it and I believe if you
[time=894] study it you come to the conclusion that yes in fact your disobedience your iniquity your stubbornness
[time=904] your commitment as a husband to in whatever way move away from what God is giving you right here
[time=912] and you truly literally run the risk of being a man whose prayers are hindered.
[time=921] You want to just a real clear word for hindered useless doesn't work no go.
[time=930] God right here sets a bar for us husbands of obedience and sincerity in our commitment
[time=942] to what he has outlined for us and right there at the end of that verse he says you don't think this is important let me just tell you you get this wrong and you run the risk of your prayers
[time=953] being hindered well what's above it there what's above it in three seven three phrases we looked
[time=960] at the first two last week I want to just quickly go back over those this morning we saw at the beginning of verse seven the phrase in the same way husbands in the same way you see it there
[time=970] at the beginning of the text we studied that and came to the conclusion that that is so
[time=976] important for us as husbands to understand because that phrase in the same way points back to the
[time=983] middle of chapter two where God first introduces the concept of submission in the book of first Peter
[time=990] there in chapter two he talks about the submission of God's people to God he goes on to talk about
[time=997] the submission of God's people to authorities he talks about the submission of God's people to
[time=1003] employers he talks about the submission of God's people to those who mistreat them he talks about in
[time=1009] the beginning of verse three the submission of a wife to a husband and here in three seven he says
[time=1015] in the same way husbands be submissive husbands be submissive to God's call for for your sacrificial
[time=1029] service toward your wife and we talked about submission this humility this willingness
[time=1036] to come under this willingness to minus arrogance and minus pride move towards someone in this case
[time=1043] your bride with a sense of gentleness and humility and in the same way husbands posture yourselves
[time=1052] with submission live with it says there in three seven and you husbands in the same way live with
[time=1059] your wives and I want to just remind you this morning that last week we talked about proximity
[time=1065] we talked about the fact how God's designed for you as a husband is to physically emotionally
[time=1071] spiritually practically live with her we're talking about being together in God's design
[time=1078] there's a closeness in God's design there's a friendship in God's design we're not two ships passing in the night in God's design she isn't over here and he's over there no guys you're
[time=1089] not just renting a room there is a a clear uh with with simple word with there's clear implication
[time=1099] of the kind of posture you're to have physically emotionally spiritually he says live with her be
[time=1105] with her move toward her not away from her in the same way be humble live with be present not absence
[time=1113] and then we come to this great phrase it says there in three seven in an understanding way
[time=1119] in an understanding way as with someone weaker since she is a woman and show her honor so let's
[time=1128] look at this in an understanding way and here's how I want to come at this I want you husbands in the
[time=1135] room or even you young men who aren't husbands yet please take note someday you might be and when
[time=1142] you get that chance if God in fact brings that to your life we want you to be able to do that and come at that in a way that honors him here's why I want husbands in the room this morning to think about this I want you to become a student I want you more and more so in your life and in
[time=1158] your relationship with her to become a student I want you to go to school all over again on your
[time=1164] wife I want you to be a student of your wife what I don't want for you is I don't want for you
[time=1171] five ten fifteen years down the road to hear something encounter something come up against
[time=1177] something with her and do what I see way too many times guys do which is kind of this kind of this I have no idea what she's talking about kind of look I don't want that for you I
[time=1193] don't want this look on your face and I don't want this feeling in your heart of I'm lost here
[time=1201] I have no clue where she's going I don't get her at all I don't want that I want for you the
[time=1212] ability to know and I want for you the ability to understand some things I want for you the
[time=1219] ability to connect at some meaningful level or levels in a way that really can make a difference
[time=1226] I want you to be a student of your wife and it's really a lot like what I've seen my wife do and
[time=1233] I'll kind of flip it here because I think in some ways moms are really good at this maybe this kind of relates maybe it doesn't but I can remember nights laying in bed with a little toddler we
[time=1243] had a few down the hall and it's you know the middle of the night or you just kind of get comfortable and all of a sudden he or she starts crying all of a sudden the house is just filled with this whale from this little baby in this crib down the hall and I'm laying there my first
[time=1259] thought is I listen to the crying is oh god please stop it her first thought it was it's interesting
[time=1266] a mom can sit there and lay in bed for 15 seconds and she turned to me and she'd say he's angry
[time=1274] or she turned to me and say oh he's sad and or she turned to me and say oh I got it
[time=1280] you know I got it I'll go I'll go take care but he's scared she just could listen to his cry and she knew him or her so well that she could decipher from a cry
[time=1296] what was going on in 99% of the time she was what she was right because she just she knew him and
[time=1304] she knew him or her because she was with him she knew him or her because she paid attention
[time=1310] she knew that cry because she was around and there's a knowledge there there's insight that I want
[time=1317] you as a husband to be able to have as it relates not just to the cry of your wife but to who she is
[time=1326] how she thinks to how she functions so just a few things I mentioned these to you last week I'm
[time=1333] going to come back and just hit him real quick give you a little more insight I hope number one in your effort to become a student and live with your wife in an understanding way understand this
[time=1345] that she was designed by God just like God designed the temple and I told you this last week the
[time=1354] word in Genesis where it says God created woman is the same original language same word used later
[time=1362] in the Old Testament where it talks about the temple of God that Solomon ends up building
[time=1369] wife woman temple of God same words there are some things husbands for you to learn about your
[time=1376] wife being like a temple here's where I want to start going your Bibles if you will going your
[time=1384] Bibles back to first Kings would you all the way everybody let me hear those pages turning go back to first Kings to get the chronicles you went too far go to first Kings six your wife is designed
[time=1397] guys listen your wife was designed like a temple like the temple of God and here's what I mean follow
[time=1403] with me about halfway through this you'll really start to understand I think where I'm going first Kings chapter six verse two here we go as for the temple as for the house which King Solomon built
[time=1415] for the Lord its length was 60 cubits and its width 20 cubits and its height 30 cubits the porch in
[time=1421] front of the name of the house was 20 cubits in length corresponding to the width of the house and its depth along the front of the house which was 10 cubits also for the house he made windows
[time=1432] with artistic frames against the wall of the house he built stories encompassing the walls of the house around both the nave and the inner sanctuary thus he made side chambers all around the lowest story
[time=1443] was five cubits wide and the middle was six cubits wide and the third was seven cubits wide for on
[time=1449] the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around in order that the beams would not be inserted in the walls of the house the house while it was being built was built a stone prepared
[time=1460] at the quarry and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any iron tool heard in the house where it was being built the doorway for the lowest side chamber was on the right side of the house and
[time=1471] they would go up by winding stairs to the middle story and from the middle to the third so he built
[time=1477] the house and finished it and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar he also built
[time=1483] the stories against the whole house each five cubits high and they were fastened to the house
[time=1489] with timbers of cedar a wife is like the temple as i read that did that sound
[time=1500] easy did it sound simple did it sound quickly accomplished no and i'm not trying to be funny
[time=1511] i'm lifting this up this is a great thing for you and me to understand there is intricacy
[time=1518] to it and her there is a multifacetedness to it and her there is a detail to it
[time=1529] and her no your effort or mind to understand her to engage with her to function with her
[time=1539] is not simple it's not quick it's not easy listen it requires if you just read through
[time=1546] that you've got to understand the amount of work and effort that is required for you to interact
[time=1553] with get your arms around cedars and planks and side windows and offsets and cubits and porches
[time=1560] and hallways and stairs there's a lot there i think we had a picture of the temple yeah there it is
[time=1569] see it's not like a guy see a guy you know a guy needs a couch in the tv see there's a big difference there there's probably a cell phone and laptop somewhere in there
[time=1579] and that's it that's all he needs that's all that's to him i'm overstaining it but you get
[time=1585] the point it's complicated now listen you say to me you know what kelly okay okay okay i get you but it sounds to me like you're saying it's a lot of work it takes a lot of effort there's a lot to her and i'm saying yes that's what i'm saying and then you say well you know what i work all day i work hard all day and i don't want to come home and have to work more and to you
[time=1607] then i say your marriage is host it will never be what god designed it to be if you're not willing
[time=1615] to come home and work really really hard for a really good purpose because not only is she
[time=1621] complicated and detailed and multifaceted like the temple but understand this she is also
[time=1627] and like the temple she is designed to bring glory to god when interacted with properly don't miss that like the temple designed to bring glory and honor to god when interacted with
[time=1642] when approached properly you want to live with your wife in an understanding way it will take
[time=1649] some effort it will take some work and it will take your willingness to do your very best
[time=1655] with his help to put your arms around something that is really really while complicated beautiful
[time=1662] while detailed it brings great she brings great glory and honored to god also i mentioned this
[time=1668] last week i want to just come back to it first peter three seven talks about a weaker vessel
[time=1674] again so many wives over the years have taken such issue with this please don't take issue
[time=1680] with this this isn't talking about your IQ this isn't talking about your standing before god
[time=1686] this is talking about the word vessel there i told you is like it's like fine china and i want
[time=1693] you to think this morning about fine china not tupperware i want you just to write that down
[time=1699] most of you in the room remember tupperware i think we have a i think we have a picture of fine china
[time=1705] and then i think we have a picture uh yeah so there it is a big hand for tupperware you remember tupperware right there's tupperware back to fine china god's words this guys treat your wife in an
[time=1716] understanding way that means you handle her like you would handle fine china you don't handle her

[time=1730] my friends is handled with great care fine china is handled with great care and gentleness
[time=1736] not burped remember how we used to burp tupperware you just squeeze it down the middle and lift up
[time=1742] the side and it kind of burped you know let out all the air no no no no we don't handle wives
[time=1749] like tupperware you handle a wife like you would find china she is as a wife as a vessel she is

[time=1763] tupperware or things like tupperware in our kitchens and you know and i know where that drawer is and
[time=1770] you literally just toss it in the drawer and when you need it you go in and just reach it and grab something and you try and match the top with the bottom that's not what we're talking about here she's not plasticware she's china we we make separate cabinets for china we put china on display

[time=2087] with her to befriend complexity assumes patience i read this this week to befriend complexity
[time=2094] assumes patience vigilance and the readiness to guys say it try again try again try again
[time=2104] on the fine china front three things real quick this is this is helping her to have a sense
[time=2111] that she's married to a man who's coming at this in a way not to treat her like Tupperware but to
[time=2118] treat her like fine china number one go out to dinner or to dessert without your phone
[time=2125] oh do i hear name n ladies no listen listen technology technology listen technology can help
[time=2133] you know that and i know that there are all kinds of ways technology can help our marriage or parenting our spiritual leadership in the home to have the thing out at debrands is not one of them
[time=2144] okay you and i both have to keep making progress on the level of distraction
[time=2151] that we allow into these brief but potentially sweet moments take her somewhere have her take
[time=2159] her phone if the kids need something they'll call her leave your phone at home secondly number two
[time=2167] talk to her about talk to her about schedule calendar and plans before you say yes
[time=2174] for her talk to her about schedule calendar and plans talk to her before you say yes to others
[time=2182] it sounds very basic i know sounds very just rudimentary but guys we need help on all fronts
[time=2189] amen talk to her it makes her feel cherished it makes her feel valued it doesn't just make her feel
[time=2195] that way it is it is showing your willingness to talk things through with her before certain
[time=2201] commitments get made it's a huge help ministers to her incredibly number three i heard this years
[time=2207] ago what a great great principle this is i would say that i'm about i would say that i'm i'm going
[time=2215] at about a c plus b minus rate on this one i'm going to keep working on it it's a lifelong
[time=2221] journey but i think it's really good guys to hold on to this apologize first you say but what if i didn't start it
[time=2232] you know what that statement right there that so many of you in the room just made quietly
[time=2240] that i have made way too many times is so childish it's so did you hear that
[time=2247] what if i didn't start it what if she it's just so it's so immature be a be a servant leader devoted to god and his
[time=2260] design to put your arms around this thing that gets messy at times whether you started it or not
[time=2266] bring peace and restoration by being in the one willing to just put aside 10 minutes close the
[time=2272] door and say hey you know what i'm i contributed to this thing and i just want you to know i'm sorry and i want to just say let's go in a different direction right now you and me lead humbly
[time=2285] i don't know of a better example than humble leadership than apologizing first
[time=2293] and paving away for her to say wow okay well i'm sorry too and let's make our way down this road
[time=2302] together let me say something about an understanding way and again i'm not trying to be comical here and i'm certainly not trying to make light of this
[time=2313] so i want to say that to you wives and i want to say that to you guys as i say this
[time=2319] the scripture here in first peter three says to live with her in an understanding way i have to be careful and i think i even did this last week i sometimes when i read this i think to
[time=2338] myself kelly you've got to understand kebrah i sometimes say to you that what this is saying
[time=2346] is that you husbands need to have to for this thing to work understand your wife
[time=2352] and a lot of you ladies hear that and go yes yes please and i just want to i want to just make
[time=2363] this little point here it doesn't say understand them through and through 100 percent i get you
[time=2374] completely i have become a woman in my mind and i know exactly what that's about it says live with her in a way that would appear to be what understanding
[time=2390] i'm not trying to give any shortcuts here i'm trying to help you see that if you view or like a temple if you view or like find china if you take the time put aside the space to get to
[time=2402] know to ask the questions to live with her with humility and servant leadership there's going to be a great opportunity for you day in and day out to live with her in a way
[time=2413] that communicates understanding even if you don't understand everything can i maybe get an amen all right thank you i'm not trying to lower the bar i'm trying to make
[time=2426] the bar accurate and i'm trying to make sure that we understand there's a way for us to come at this that i think really honors god and encourages a wife okay guys Ephesians 5 moving on from an understanding way turn in your bibles to Ephesians chapter 5 i want to read to
[time=2442] you 525 and 26 husbands it says love your wives just as christ also loved the church and gave himself
[time=2450] up for her so that he might verse 26 so that he might christ might sanctify her
[time=2459] do you know what that means it's the very first thing mentioned here in Ephesians 5 once he gets to this list of things that Christ models for husbands
[time=2472] he gave himself up for her so that he might sanctify her having cleansed her by the washing
[time=2482] of water with the what say it with the word so we've got sanctifying your wife and we've got
[time=2489] washing her making sure she is washed with the word this text husbands this text teaches us
[time=2500] that the husband's christ like love is so consuming that sanctifying his wife sanctifying means
[time=2509] spiritually seeing her grow spiritually seeing her mature her spiritual development
[time=2516] becoming more and more like christ that sanctifying his wife is priority of all of his priorities
[time=2523] this passage says that that endeavor her spiritual growth is priority number one
[time=2532] in your life as a husband not her wardrobe not her house not her figure not her trips not her hobbies
[time=2544] not her comfort not her fun not keeping her happy not her kids not her friends many of those
[time=2551] tremendous endeavors but that shouldn't be your number one priority as a husband when it comes to
[time=2558] what you're bringing to this relationship it says here sanctifying her her spiritual growing is the
[time=2565] most important priority to the husband described in Ephesians 5 and every husband in this room every
[time=2573] husband watching the broadcast every husband listening online has to ask yourself that question this morning is that your really is that your number one priority when you think about your
[time=2587] relationship with her and the husband encourages don't forget and the husband encourages and makes
[time=2593] sure that his wife has given every opportunity possible to be engaged in and connected to the
[time=2600] simple most powerful sanctifying tool in existence which is the scriptures
[time=2607] the Word of God now husbands listen to this it's very this is this can get dicey this can get
[time=2615] interesting it can also get extremely fruitful and it can be a blessing but understand this
[time=2621] husband's you can I know this you can't make her you can't as a husband make her be washed in the
[time=2629] Word but I tell you what you can do as a servant leader pursuing integrity and character in your
[time=2638] own life three things write them down number one you can model this I mean what does she see in you
[time=2645] what does she see as she observes you in your life what do what would she say is your number one
[time=2653] priority growing yourself spiritually or a list of 15 other things
[time=2660] so you can't make her guys but you can certainly model it for her
[time=2667] secondly you can make sure here's one thing you can do you can make sure and again I hesitate to use that phrase because sometimes you can't but you can certainly do your best to make
[time=2677] sure you and her are here on a Sunday morning to hear the word of God you can certainly do your best
[time=2685] to make sure that you and her are in a small group or an a bf on a Sunday morning where the word of God gets taught and lifted up and people get it infused into their lives and thirdly you
[time=2696] can try you really can husband's you can try to free up some time for her maybe to help make the
[time=2702] washing of the word happen in her life maybe there's something you can do to help with her schedule so that she could meet with a friend who wants to mentor her maybe there's something you could provide in terms of schedule that would allow her to go to a bible study on a certain day or evening I don't know how that works but I bet there's probably something you could do to help encourage that let me just say this and we'll move on what we're talking about here husbands with your wives what we're talking about here is what's influencing her the washing of the
[time=2732] word this really comes back to what's influencing her because listen don't miss this whatever is
[time=2740] guiding whatever is guiding her in her day-to-day life whatever it is that she's going to that
[time=2747] provides her with direction whatever is guiding and directing her is controlling her
[time=2755] and you you don't want that to be Ellen you don't want that to be a chat room
[time=2765] you don't want that to be culture no no no no no you want that to be the scriptures
[time=2774] you want the word of god the life-changing eternity altering word of god to be the thing
[time=2781] that is guiding and directing and controlling and so you do everything you possibly can to model that for her to encourage her in that direction to make it possible for her husband's
[time=2793] love your wives washing her in the word wives I'm going to jump in here we'll make our way
[time=2800] through a little bit and we'll come back to some more next week but now let's talk to you women in the room married or unmarried either way lots to learn and lots to think about
[time=2810] as we look at God's design for the wife let's go back to first Peter can we back to first Peter
[time=2817] chapter three verse one there is some familiar terminology in the same way you wives same way
[time=2825] be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word
[time=2834] they the disobedient husband may be one w o n meaning one back meaning turned around from his
[time=2845] disobedience so that if any of them are disobedient to the word they the disobedient husband may be
[time=2852] turned around without a word from you without a word could have said with few could have said
[time=2866] with minimal could have said with just a little no it says without a single word
[time=2880] you see how does this work by the behavior instead by the behavior of their wives what kind of behavior
[time=2891] as they observe the disobedient husband as he observes your chaste talks about purity and
[time=2897] integrity your chaste and respectful behavior your chaste and respectful behavior
[time=2906] and I just maybe it goes without say but I'm going to just say it anyway you say hmm that's
[time=2913] interesting chaste and respectful behavior gets brought up in this discussion about a wife's
[time=2921] course of action with a disobedient husband it makes all the sense in the world and again I'm
[time=2928] not trying to be cute or humorous because in the midst of I know okay I've been I'm a disobedient
[time=2936] husband I'm disobedient at times and I see with my own eyes the impact that my disobedience has
[time=2945] and I'm a human being like my wife and like many of you and I'm telling you this in the midst of
[time=2951] being the recipient a wife of the actions of a disobedient husband the last thing humanly speaking
[time=2959] that you want to do in that case is be quiet you just you want to say you want to say something
[time=2969] you want to do something you want to grab him by the you want to do anything you can to get him to
[time=2975] understand are you hearing my verbiage you want to do everything you can to get him to understand
[time=2981] what you want and I don't think it's a coincidence that here in this passage God says you know what
[time=2988] that's not how we're going to do this and it's really tough when the Bible gets counterintuitive isn't it when you get slapped on the cheat the last thing you and I want to do is
[time=3003] offer the what the other one for God's word says do it why you know how in the world can I be
[time=3012] Bibles is be anxious for nothing how can we be anxious for nothing when there is so much to be
[time=3018] anxious about I don't know about you but the last thing I want to do for an enemy of mine is what
[time=3026] pray for them and yet the Bible says I am to love them and pray for them the Bible gets so
[time=3033] counterintuitive and wives I think this might quite possibly be one of the the greatest examples
[time=3040] of this ever when you look here in first Peter three and you see the course of action that God
[time=3046] commands you to follow when it comes to your disobedient disappointing frustrating husband
[time=3053] and what does first Peter three one and two say that course of action is what is that course of
[time=3061] action silence and modeling God honoring character choose quietness and live with integrity
[time=3077] now listen listen please don't walk out of here and start sending me emails that said I am
[time=3083] telling you to live 24/7 lives of silence this is not I am not standing here saying that God has
[time=3090] designed for you as a woman to be quiet all the time we're talking about an instance we're talking
[time=3097] about situations here we're talking about when face to face with his disobedience and its effect
[time=3103] on you now that might be often but I'm not saying women walk around quiet there are so many things
[time=3110] so many things that you bring to our lives verbally that we need in this case God has designed your
[time=3117] course of action to look like this God's word says please please write this down God's word says
[time=3125] here that your best shot wives and by the way God's designed for your best shot and God's designed
[time=3131] for seeing your husband won over turned around is not your verbal correction it is not your verbal criticism it is not your verbal reminders it is not your verbal confrontation
[time=3144] just look at that and there are wives humorously and seriously
[time=3155] both the same time all over the room saying wait a minute you are kidding me if I don't correct criticize remind or confront how will he ever be who he's supposed to be and that's a great question if what you're wanting him to be is what God designed him to be
[time=3174] and if you're willing to trust God to bring about the change because the answer to how in the world will he ever be what I know he's supposed to be the answer
[time=3188] is by your chaste and respectful behavior Titus 2 3 to 5 look at it real quick older women likewise are to be
[time=3199] reverent in their behavior here are the words that are used not malicious gossips or enslaved to
[time=3205] much wine teaching what is good it goes on and for to say so that they may encourage the young
[time=3211] women to love their husbands to love their children and in verse 5 to be sensible there's that word pure chaste above reproach workers at home kind being subject to their own husbands
[time=3224] so that the word of God will not be dishonored and and again there are wives that sit there and they listen to this and they say wait a minute wait a minute you're telling me that behavior
[time=3235] is more inspiring to him than my words and I am telling you I am telling you as your pastor who
[time=3246] has studied this and I'm trying to communicate this to you in a meaningful way yes and I am telling you as a man yes you say explain that to me kel do my best and then we're going to be done
[time=3259] you see here's how it is from a man's perspective be a student here if you will humbling just be a student from a man's perspective
[time=3273] he knows see he knows when he's being disobedient he understands many times the ripple effect of
[time=3279] that he sees what it does to her from a man's point of view godly behavior from you
[time=3286] wife in the midst of this godly behavior that is connected to a love for and a trust in god
[time=3293] is not only attractive but it works it works it works because it is viewed as it is perceived as
[time=3302] and it is selfless men don't like nagging men don't like incessant negative correction men
[time=3316] don't respond well to criticism because men see all the above for what it is it's self serving
[time=3323] you want this and you want it now and you're going to get it and you'll pay the price
[time=3331] and there usually is one as you start in with the words you see one approach serves and follows a
[time=3339] higher purpose it leaves change and correction for the most part up to god the other approach
[time=3345] wants their way now here's the truth of the matter the truth of the matter is the without a word
[time=3354] approach is so hands-off and it's so vulnerable it's scary oh it's a scary place to be
[time=3363] i know that again i've experienced it and i have caused it and wives i'm not wrong am i
[time=3372] it's a scary place to be and i want you to stand with me this morning as i read god's word i want
[time=3380] to say this to you as i read this god's word god in his heart understands how scary it can be to
[time=3386] follow his course of action that's why i'm so thankful that we can end this morning with first peter three five and six right here in this very passage for in this way in former times the holy
[time=3398] women also who hoped in god used to adorn themselves being submissive to their own husbands just as
[time=3405] sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord and you have become her children if you do what is right what
[time=3412] god has prescribed without being say it ladies frightened by any fear would you bow your heads
[time=3421] i'm going to ask elders and staff to just make their way down to the front it was so encouraging last week any husbands any wives any couples in the room that would love to be prayed for and
[time=3432] encouraged along these lines we'll have elders and staff down here at the front they'd be more than happy to pray with you this morning oh our father in heaven with our heads bowed we stand before you i hope and i pray god as a family with great humility oh we need these truths oh god we
[time=3449] need to understand and live out these principles and we are helpless without you oh god give us the
[time=3456] strength to pursue these things god i pray you give us the the willingness and the readiness to ask for help from those in our lives who maybe we we believe or or think have an understanding of
[time=3468] these truths that they could pass along to us oh god i pray that with great humility we would follow you ask others for help and encouragement even come down these aisles this morning and be
[time=3479] prayed for oh god we know what a difference this can make in our homes and our lives even in our
[time=3487] culture god marriages that are made better we pray god you'd move us in this direction
[time=3494] in your son's name we pray amen
[time=3517] [MUSIC]
[time=3547] you
