[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It's great to have you with us and I'm thankful for the times that we've had recently as we've been making our way through this new series we've entitled We Are Family.
[time=44] We have been taking a weekly look at this biblical picture of marriage and parenting and spiritual leadership in the home.
[time=54] And so far as we've made our way through God's design for the husband and God's design for the wife, the response has been overwhelming and so encouraging as we see couples giving themselves in some cases for the first time.
[time=71] In other cases it's been a wake-up call, a reminder of what God has designed but either way we're seeing couples embrace what God has designed.
[time=80] They're giving themselves in a whole new way to marriage the way God wants it to happen and it is so encouraging to see.
[time=89] This morning's message, we shift to the parenting realm and the next week on to spiritual leadership, the kind of spiritual leadership that can really make a difference in a home and in the lives of kids and parents alike.
[time=103] But I wanna say this to those of you watching as we've talked about marriage and as we've talked about the role of the husband and the wife and the way God designed that and the way it can be very, very fruitful and encouraging and right.
[time=118] I wanna give you something to look forward to, the art of marriage.
[time=121] You see the graphic here on the screen and the information at the bottom of the screen.
[time=126] This is something I want all of you to consider coming and being a part of with us this spring here at Blackock.
[time=132] It's gonna be a two-day conference and a great, great chance for you, whoever you are, thinking about marriage, maybe you're newly married, maybe you've been married for 30 years and you need a shot of encouragement.
[time=144] We want you to come and be a part of the art of marriage.
[time=148] You can go to our website at blackockministries.org.
[time=151] You can learn all about it.
[time=152] All your questions can get answered.
[time=154] There's registration opportunities right there online or you can call the church office and we'd be happy to point you in the right direction.
[time=161] Marriage is huge and when we do it right, the way God designed it, the blessings are huge as well.
[time=168] I hope you'll come and be encouraged.
[time=171] Okay, thank you for tuning in.
[time=172] Thanks so much for your friendship and your partnership and the broadcast.
[time=176] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=179] God bless.

[time=493] (piano music)
[time=512] (piano music) - Thank you so much, Jonathan and choir, and with Sanctity of Life Sunday, what a great Sunday to be jumping into a discussion on parenting.
[time=526] A child is truly one of life's greatest gifts and joys.
[time=535] From that first miraculous moment when you first held them in your arms to the days of your aging and their willingness to now hold you, the journey of a parent brings immense blessing and joy, so much happiness and heartache and regret and sorrow.
[time=556] You see, sometimes all of our parental hopes
[time=565] and dreams don't materialize.
[time=567] Sometimes choices get made by us or others that change everything.
[time=572] And the road that now gets traveled can at times feel like a painful, disappointing detour.
[time=578] And do you know where our minds go?
[time=584] Whose fault is it, we ask?
[time=588] Did you as a mom or dad do something wrong?
[time=592] Did you miss something along the way?
[time=594] Was there anything?
[time=595] There's something you could have done better.
[time=597] You think?
[time=601] Probably.
[time=604] Or what about an 18-year-old or a 19-year-old or a 25-year-old?
[time=610] Can they now be judged on their own merit or is everything they do simply a reflection on us?
[time=616] Or is it now purely an indicator of who they are?
[time=619] Answer?
[time=621] Yes.
[time=623] Probably yes, so for parents, plenty of mistakes to be confessed.
[time=627] Lessons hopefully learn forgiveness and grace liberally given by God, but what to do with the pain of parenting?
[time=638] The ache that at times can feel so persistent.
[time=642] Three-year-olds or 30-year-olds makes no difference.
[time=645] What to do with parenting's pain?
[time=650] Maybe these are the moments we turn into kids again.
[time=654] Think about it, church.
[time=655] Maybe this is when we lean into the arms of our gracious heavenly father who's well acquainted with our failures.
[time=663] And like a kid, allow his unconditional love and mercy to remind us that parenting isn't a performance, it's not a recital.
[time=672] Best foot forward, crowd gathered, look how good I am.
[time=678] No, parenting is a flawed endeavor from the beginning that presents multiple opportunities in countless settings along the way to beg God for help and wisdom with our kids, where that wisdom was applied well and fruit was produced.
[time=692] We thank him, wherever that wisdom was ignored or misapplied, we confess our failure, we live with the results, we do, we live with him.
[time=706] And we choose hopefully not to be defined by our failures, but instead by our humble repentance and our pursuit of a God who redeems us and our failures.
[time=718] And in time and in ways we would have never dreamed he makes things new, kids, moms, dads, families, futures, he makes them new.
[time=735] So disappointment or shame need no longer reign.
[time=739] Hope is rising for any parent willing to be a child again in need, in need of their Heavenly Father's touch.
[time=752] [MUSIC - 69 seconds]
[time=824] - If you're a parent in the room of smorning
[time=838] and you can identify with the truth of every hour needing God and His grace and wisdom, say amen, amen.
[time=846] Well, as we begin this morning, I've got a question for you as a parent, maybe as a grandparent for those of you who are directly involved in the care and oversight of the children that God and His sovereignty has given you.
[time=863] Question for you, with your own eyes, I want you to think about this, really think about it, with your own eyes.
[time=868] What have you seen God do in your life in the last week, in the last several months?
[time=876] What have you seen God do?
[time=879] And I want to show you how this relates to parenting.
[time=881] Have you ever marveled at His creation?
[time=884] Anybody ever just stood back and said to yourself, "Oh my goodness, look at what He made." Have you ever marveled at His creation?
[time=892] Have you seen that with your own eyes?
[time=894] God's creative power.
[time=895] Have you ever watched God save someone spiritually?
[time=900] You ever seen that?
[time=901] You ever seen God begin to tug at someone's heart?
[time=905] You ever seen God reveal over time their need for a savior?
[time=909] Have you ever seen God bring them to a place of fully surrendering themselves to Him?
[time=914] Someone you never would have imagined.
[time=916] You've seen God do that.
[time=918] Have you witnessed His redemptive rescuing power?
[time=922] Have you ever watched God meet a need that just seemed completely out of reach?
[time=928] Have you seen the power of God and His compassion and care?
[time=934] Have you ever watched God do something in you?
[time=939] You never would have dreamed He'd do something that just blew your mind.
[time=943] Have you seen God do this?
[time=945] Have you seen with your own eyes the love and faithfulness of God?
[time=950] So many of you in the room say, of course, absolutely.
[time=954] But what's this got to do with parenting?
[time=956] Well, I would submit to you this morning that it really, if in fact you have seen these things, it forms the foundation of one of the great biblical pictures of parenting given to us in God's Word.
[time=970] Turn with me if you would to Deuteronomy 4.
[time=972] If you've seen these things, just like the people of Israel had seen these things.
[time=977] Look what it says in Deuteronomy 4.3.
[time=981] First part of Deuteronomy 4.3, look at it church.
[time=984] It says right there.
[time=986] It says, "Your eyes have seen what the Lord has done." Your eyes have seen what the Lord has done.
[time=996] Many of you in the room this morning can echo that very thought.
[time=999] You have seen parents with your own eyes what the Lord has done.
[time=1004] And then look what it says in verse nine.
[time=1006] So because of that, give heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently so that you do not forget the things which are what?
[time=1016] Say it, which your eyes have seen.
[time=1019] Do not let them depart from your heart
[time=1025] all the days of your life.
[time=1027] But make them these things that you have seen.
[time=1029] Make them known to your sons and your grandsons to your daughters and granddaughters as well.
[time=1036] Remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Orib.
[time=1039] When the Lord said to me, assemble the people to me that I may let them hear my words so they may learn to fear me all the days they live on the earth and that they may teach their who?
[time=1053] Children, oh church, be reminded this morning that a child's view of God, their appropriate and reverent fear of God, their understanding of God and his love and his faithfulness towards those he loves, a child's knowledge and understanding of God's laws and God's will, it all comes according to scripture, it all emanates from, it all starts with mom and dad.
[time=1082] And maybe for you that's just mom, maybe for you that's just dad.
[time=1086] Wherever you're at this morning be reminded of God's design that the spiritual investment that gets made in a child, the scriptures teach that parents are the ones that disciple their children.
[time=1100] I'm really grateful, personally, very thankful for the, wow, the 13, 14, 15, so the years
[time=1113] that Blackhawk Christian School has been investing in our kids, I'm so thankful for the years that Blackhawk Ministries Sunday School classes have been instilling love and truth into the lives of our kids, I'm so grateful for student ministries, so thankful for what goes on and liquid in 212, I'm so thankful for the myriad of people in this family who have spiritually invested in our family, absolutely grateful, love it, can imagine where we'd be without it, it is all ancillary benefits that we are grateful for, it's wonderful, but at the core of our kids, spiritual formation, God's Word says to you and to me this morning, it's you.
[time=1156] It is you, it is the time and the effort and the willingness
[time=1163] and the readiness that you have to teach them and love them and model for them and walk with them and invest in them, the truth of God's Word, the truth and the strength of his character, the things that he's called them to begins with you, hey, I wanna do something this morning, would you turn in your Bibles to Deuteronomy 11, you may be in four already, so just go over to Deuteronomy 11, verses 18 and 19, so many times on a Sunday morning and I can feel it already this morning, I start reading passages to you quickly
[time=1198] and trying to explain them somewhat quickly so we can move on and this morning, I'm gonna just kinda put the breaks on and this morning, I'm gonna give you an opportunity to do something that we don't give you the chance to do on a regular basis, maybe we should do it more often, but I wanna, I wanna read, I wanna meditate, I wanna give you the chance to read and meditate and pray, I wanna allow the Word of God and the Spirit of God to do just in you this morning what it wants to do and I'm trusting God with this and so I'm gonna just kinda walk you through a brief exercise as it relates to this passage, we're gonna start by reading this passage and then we're gonna ask God to show you some things and I really hope you'll participate in this with us and I really hope God uses it to bless you and encourage you this morning, Deuteronomy 11, 18 and 19, would you in honor of God's Word, would you just stand quietly?
[time=1259] Parents, listen up, it says here in Deuteronomy 11, 18
[time=1265] and 19, you shall therefore impress these words of mine on your heart and on your soul, there's the internal part of this, now watch and thus you shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead, internally and externally, you are to have the Word of God around you and in you, you shall teach them verse 19,
[time=1295] you shall teach them to your sons, talking of them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road and when you lie down and when you rise up, teaching and talking, and talking and teaching and talking, all right, I want you to have a seat and here's what I want you to do is that scripture stays on the screen as the music starts, I just want you to use this time to be a very private and personal time as the scripture comes on the screen there, I want you to just read through it quietly in your own heart and mind slowly, as you read, I want you to pay attention to what word phrase
[time=1340] or idea catches your attention and I don't believe that'll be an accident, as you read this morning, pay attention to what word, what phrase or idea catches your attention as you just read through that passage slowly, go ahead, please do that, take the time and read.
[time=1371] Deuteronomy 11, 18 and 19.
[time=1375] As you read slowly, what captures your attention,
[time=1398] what word phrase or idea, now what I want you to do is I want you to meditate and by that, look, I mean this, the passages are gonna stay on the screen, I want you to read through them again and again and begin to meditate, focus your thoughts, it's a very biblical discipline, meditate on the word phrase or idea that has captured your attention, repeat it to yourself, again and again, these words of God in your mind, consider what thoughts come to mind as you meditate on this word, this phrase or idea, what are you reminded of in your life, what are you convicted of, what does it make you hope for?
[time=1445] I just want to give you a few minutes here to just repeat that word, that phrase or idea, again and again and ask yourself those questions, just work your way through those questions I just read for you and let the spirit of God and let the word of God minister to you.
[time=1487] (emotional music) What thoughts come to your mind,
[time=1505] what are you reminded of in your life?
[time=1509] You sense God bringing any conviction?
[time=1518] Does it excite you, what does it make you hope for?
[time=1520] And now I want to just invite you to pray,
[time=1527] right there in the quietness of your own heart, right there in the seat that you're sitting in.
[time=1532] Let's read the scripture one more time and as we do, you can speak to God.
[time=1542] I think most of you know that, you can tell God right now, what word, phrase or idea captured your attention and what came to your mind as you meditated upon it.
[time=1553] Ask God right where you sit this morning, ask God to use this word, phrase or idea to bless and transform you, tell him in your own words, what you've been thinking and feeling as you've listened and meditated.
[time=1569] Confess your failures, you can do that right now.
[time=1576] Celebrate recent victories.
[time=1578] Tell God from your heart how you hope this word, phrase or idea will change your heart to be more like his.
[time=1588] Go ahead and just speak to him, pray to him.
[time=1606] (gentle music) It says in verse 21, "So that your days
[time=1618] and the days of your sons, daughters, may be multiplied on the land which the Lord swore to your fathers to give them as long as the heavens remain above the earth."
[time=1635] Our Father in Heaven, I thank you for your word.
[time=1637] I thank you for these two verses.
[time=1639] I thank you for just a few moments to stop literally and allow the great truth that they possess to sink into our hearts and minds.
[time=1650] God, these are things that we can do each day.
[time=1652] We can read, meditate and pray.
[time=1654] I hope this would encourage many in the room, even those watching on the broadcast, come before you again and again and again in the days that come willing and ready to read, meditate and pray.
[time=1668] Thank you for how your word changes us.
[time=1672] Thank you for how it shapes and molds us.
[time=1675] And God, thank you for these few moments in your son's name, we pray.
[time=1680] [AMEN - 1 seconds] I bet God did something significant in many of you in the room this morning as you just took a few minutes.
[time=1692] Wish we had more and again, you can take more on your own, but I hope that's an encouragement to you.
[time=1696] Okay, now I wanna ask you to keep going here in this conversation, we're gonna shift gears just a little bit, I wanna ask you to think with me about a biblical parenting principle that so oftentimes parents like you and me recoil from, oftentimes actually truth be told parents like you and me, we run from this principle.
[time=1715] It is the principle of discipline.
[time=1718] I hope you'll write that down.
[time=1719] The biblical principle of discipline as it relates to parenting and the opportunities and responsibilities that God has given us as parents, discipline, bringing discipline to our kids.
[time=1734] And please understand that in the parent-child relationship, there is quite possibly no other principle that has been so completely underutilized or over applied than what has happened with the principle of discipline.
[time=1749] What do I mean by that?
[time=1750] Well, there really are two ends of the spectrum, usually on the discipline front.
[time=1756] On one end, we have parents who have been lazy, parents who have been too busy and/or afraid, that's true, grown men and women are afraid of kids.
[time=1768] And there have been some who have been too busy, too lazy, or actually just afraid to discipline with the result being abuse.
[time=1777] That's right, absolute utter abuse.
[time=1782] The abusive result of a boy or girl growing up self-absorbed and spoiled, believing they can actually do whatever they want without consequence.
[time=1796] Oh, the tragedy.
[time=1800] Oh, the absolute utter tragedy of never bringing discipline to the heart and life and mind of a child.
[time=1811] Yeah, there's a picture right there.
[time=1815] What do you mean, no.
[time=1817] Or on the other end of the spectrum, equally abusive.
[time=1825] We have parents who have over-disciplined with anger and years of harshness, with too many words and too much rage, with the result being boys and girls growing up in fear, afraid, embittered, and detached from mom and dad instead of intimately connected.
[time=1844] One abuse leads to one picture, another abuse leads to another.
[time=1850] And I wanna make sure that you all understand that this morning as we come to this idea of discipline, we're holding up neither.
[time=1858] We don't hold up the extremes.
[time=1860] What we attempt to do this morning is simply begin to touch on this idea of the discipline, the discipline that was the balance of discipline, the firm loving balance of discipline that God has so perfectly struck in his dealings with you and me and we hear about that perfect balance and we see the fact that God has in fact, not only authored but implemented discipline as a parent, as he parents you and as he parents me, we see it here in Hebrews 12.
[time=1896] Would you open your Bibles, turn to Hebrews 12.
[time=1899] I wanna read this through seven through 11, Hebrews 12, make a few comments as we go, but I want you to hear this.
[time=1908] I want you to let this sink in.
[time=1910] I want this to help form and shape your understanding of the discipline that God has called you as a parent to apply to those in your care, your children.
[time=1921] It says in Hebrews 12.7, it is for discipline that you endure.
[time=1928] God deals with you as with sons.
[time=1933] For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
[time=1938] Did you see that?
[time=1939] I mean, it's just absolutely out of the question.
[time=1942] That's what this says.
[time=1943] I mean, it's just absolutely, it can't even happen there.
[time=1947] There is no son who's a true son that doesn't experience the discipline from his father.
[time=1953] Look where this goes, but if you are without verse eight, if you are without discipline of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
[time=1964] Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us and we respected them.
[time=1971] Shall we not much rather be subject to the father of spirits and live?
[time=1978] For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them.
[time=1984] Let me just stop right there for a second.
[time=1987] For they verse 10, for they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, earthly fathers and mothers, bringing discipline to children as seemed best to them.
[time=2000] I just wanna make sure you understand that phrase.
[time=2003] That means they tried.
[time=2004] I hope you're trying and kids, I wanna make sure you understand, that also means they failed.
[time=2013] That also means that that effort was given within the context of their humanity and that humanity, that imperfect humanity.
[time=2024] It didn't always go well.
[time=2025] It wasn't always done right, but he contrasts that imperfect humanity with absolute perfect deity in the next phrase.
[time=2033] I love this for they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but he God disciplines us for our good so that we may share in his what?
[time=2044] Say it, church.
[time=2045] We've talked about this before.
[time=2048] Discipline brought for the sake of holiness.
[time=2053] And yet there are so many of you and the one standing in front of you this morning thinks this very thing way too many times.
[time=2063] There are so many of us who want them happy.
[time=2066] We want them to like us.
[time=2070] We don't want conflict and tension.
[time=2072] We want them smiling, not frowning.
[time=2074] We want them speaking well of us with their peers.
[time=2078] And so we don't toe the line.
[time=2081] So we don't make the hard decision.
[time=2083] So we don't bring loving but firm corrective measures.
[time=2088] And while we try to help them be happy, they lose out on the holiness that God intended for them, holiness that's gonna come from what Hebrews 12 says through his discipline, through his discipline.
[time=2105] All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful.
[time=2108] There you go.
[time=2110] But sorrowful, yet to those who have been trained by it afterwards that yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.
[time=2120] Say amen to that.
[time=2122] Such hope and such promise to look forward to as we try to emulate and model the discipline of our loving Heavenly Father.
[time=2130] So for now, as we talk about discipline this morning, I want you just to get any preconceived ideas or pictures about disciplining kids.
[time=2143] 'Cause I just say disciplined kids and all of a sudden half the room starts thinking about what it looks like and the abuses of that and debates between timeouts and spanking.
[time=2152] Listen, just for right now, let the word of God speak into that, we'll get there.
[time=2159] But for right now, just take that stuff out of your mind, the form, if you will.
[time=2163] And for a moment, as we come to the scriptures, I just invite you today to let the word of God help you to consider the heart and the purpose behind, the heart and the purpose behind discipline.
[time=2178] You can, we can flesh out forms of discipline as we go.
[time=2184] I hope as we come to the scripture that you'll give some thought to the heart and the purpose behind discipline.
[time=2192] Let's start with just a few words on discipline.
[time=2195] Discipline is they stop in the action.
[time=2197] It really does require that somebody step in.
[time=2200] Something needs to be done.
[time=2202] A stop in the action to bring loving correction, not screaming correction, not angry correction, not out of control correction.
[time=2211] No, the biblical concept of discipline carries with it the idea of loving correction for some of you in the room that's so difficult to understand because you grew up with an angry dad or a raging mom, you grew up with this picture and all you can connect to discipline is the painful abusive side of that and that breaks my heart.
[time=2236] And it's a very real issue, but that's not what we're talking about.
[time=2242] And I want to free you up this morning just by helping you understand that discipline in God's eyes is this loving correction, admonishment, and the clear communication that what just got said or done is without question unacceptable to mom, dad, and God.
[time=2259] We begin early on to help our kids understand that it's not just because I say so, it's because he says so.
[time=2266] We begin to help them understand the great authority that exists between them and their maker.
[time=2271] This is done, this stepping in, this loving correction, admonishment.
[time=2276] It's done with the understanding that effective discipline by its very definition brings with it discomfort and a costly consequence.
[time=2285] I hope you'll write that down.
[time=2287] I hope you'll think about that.
[time=2288] Hebrews 12 just said, it's not fun.
[time=2291] No, it brings with it discomfort and a costly consequence.
[time=2298] Oh, please realize that children are blessed and kept from a heartache when early on they come to the clear understanding through loving, careful discipline that disobedience hurts.
[time=2314] So many of you, parents in the room today,
[time=2321] you know that that's true.
[time=2323] We sometimes connect those lessons learned to adulthood
[time=2329] and every one of you would look me in the eye and you would say, absolutely disobedience hurts.
[time=2336] Walking outside the lines that God has established
[time=2342] brings pain and yet sometimes you and I are so hesitant to bring that training and that realization into the mind and heart and soul of a two-year-old or a three-year-old or a four-year-old.
[time=2361] A loving spanking, an intentional swat, a loss of privilege, however, wherever you arrive on the discipline issue, please allow these words of God that we're about to read to penetrate your hearts and minds, parents and kids.
[time=2376] Oh, kids, hang on here, just real quick, kids, kids in the room, anybody who is still under the roof, anybody in the room who's still under the authority of your mom and dad, three-year-olds, 13-year-olds.
[time=2393] I mean, whoever you are, there's a lot of you here today.
[time=2396] Can I just remind you quickly of the great benefit of discipline?
[time=2400] I know so many of you are kind to me.
[time=2403] I hope you'll be kind to me after I say this to you.
[time=2406] You need to be disciplined.
[time=2408] You desperately need to be disciplined.
[time=2413] Look what it says in Proverbs 13, 18, kids in the room.
[time=2417] Just kids just kind of tune in here for a moment.
[time=2420] Proverbs 13, 18, poverty and shame will come to him who neglects discipline, but he who regards reproof, he who accepts it, he who sees it is valuable.
[time=2433] Do you see that?
[time=2434] We'll be honored.
[time=2435] Oh, kids, understand that the end of the road for you, if you're one who neglects and wants to stay away from the discipline that God brings through parents, it is poverty and shame.
[time=2449] And that poverty and shame there is literal, and that poverty and shame there is figurative, it does not go well.
[time=2457] Kids, look at Proverbs 3, 11.
[time=2462] My son, he says, do not reject the discipline of the Lord or lo his reproof.
[time=2471] So many kids grow up and parents don't help with this.
[time=2475] So many kids growing up hating discipline, they've got this view of it that it's just bad.
[time=2480] And we have to help them understand, don't lo that, don't hate it, don't reject it.
[time=2488] It brings life, it brings promise, it helps you have a future.
[time=2493] Oh, I hate even reading Proverbs 5, it always burdens my heart, but we've got to again consider it's truth because there are times kids in the room, there are times when you grow up, times when you have rejected discipline, there are stories I could tell you of those who were kids and they aren't kids any longer and they didn't listen to these truths.
[time=2522] And they end up with everything, just sideways and broken and it's harsh and it's empty
[time=2530] and it's lonely and the author of Proverbs says and you've grown at your final end when you're flesh and your body are consumed, this is not a good picture.
[time=2543] And you say, what do you say then?
[time=2547] What you say then is how I have hated what?
[time=2552] Instruction.
[time=2553] Yeah, Hebrew word there for instruction is the word for guess what?
[time=2557] Discipline.
[time=2559] How I have hated instruction and my heart spurned reproof.
[time=2563] You don't want to be at that end.
[time=2569] And so I say to you kids, oh, young ones and older ones,
[time=2575] love it, look for it, welcome it, God will use it with imperfect parents who don't administer it properly all the time.
[time=2584] He will use it to grow you as a young woman and as a young man.
[time=2589] Parents, be used by God to grow mold and lovingly shape your kids into the image of God.
[time=2597] Let me just read these passages to you.
[time=2600] Oh, please listen with great humility.
[time=2602] Proverbs 13, 24, he who withholds the rod.
[time=2606] Here we see an instrument of discipline being referred to.
[time=2610] He who withholds the rod.
[time=2612] He who doesn't discipline hates his son.
[time=2617] Or daughter, but he who loves him disciplines him diligently.
[time=2622] You're marked by this, you're characterized as a parent,
[time=2629] as one who lovingly but firmly brings correction to help mold and shape their heart, not to scare them but to love them and to help them grow up to be young men and women who can make decisions that honor God because you help them see the difference between what was right and wrong.
[time=2651] Proverbs 19, 18, all these are sobering words, discipline your son while there is hope.
[time=2659] And do not desire his what, say it.
[time=2664] Yeah, it's hard to say that, I know.
[time=2667] But what that's saying to you this morning is that you might as well desire that he or she just die.
[time=2673] If what you're going to say is, you know what, we're not going to do the discipline thing.
[time=2681] I don't want to stifle, I don't want to squelch.
[time=2684] I don't want to put parameters.
[time=2685] I want you to let them be who they want to be.
[time=2687] You know what, if you're not going to bring correction where God's word calls us to bring correction, you might as well wish for their death.
[time=2695] Because that's where they're headed without the loving correction of God administered through a willing parent who understands and sees the truth.
[time=2708] Proverbs 22, 15, foolishness is bound up
[time=2714] in the heart of a child.
[time=2715] Kids, we love you, but that is true, amen?
[time=2717] Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child.
[time=2721] It's just 'cause you're a child.
[time=2723] It's just okay.
[time=2724] You don't know, I'm not being condescending.
[time=2728] You don't know, you're just a what?
[time=2731] You're just a kid.
[time=2732] What do you know compared to what God has taught, you know, him or her or me or your gramp?
[time=2740] I mean, it's okay, you're just a kid, but you need help to navigate and decipher choices that need to be made, attitudes that need to be harbored.
[time=2751] I mean, it's just so clear.
[time=2754] The rot of discipline will remove it.
[time=2757] The foolishness that is bound up in the heart of a child, the rot of discipline will remove it far from him.
[time=2764] Discipline helps you as a kid understand that living outside the parameters God has established brings pain, disobedience hurts.
[time=2772] That's wisdom.
[time=2773] Foolishness gets chased as wisdom takes up residence.
[time=2778] Proverbs 29, 15.
[time=2781] The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child who gets his own way brings shame.
[time=2789] Bring shame to his mother.
[time=2791] Now, there's a, I don't know if there's such thing as a slight elephant in the room, but there's a certainly little elephant in the room here.
[time=2800] And it is this, it's this idea of a rod.
[time=2802] And I want to just say to you, here's where you get, here's where you get my opinion.
[time=2809] And it's a strong opinion because I really don't think it's an opinion.
[time=2814] I think I'm just really telling you what it says.
[time=2817] Sometimes I give you opinions where things seem to be a little fuzzy.
[time=2820] I don't think that the issue of physical discipline,
[time=2826] corporal punishment, call it whatever you want.
[time=2831] The Bible right here clearly communicates that there is an instrument that God designed to be used.
[time=2840] And it's not a hand, it's something else.
[time=2846] And I think there's purpose and intention behind that.
[time=2849] But the Bible clearly says right here that there is an instrument that is used to help bring this loving firm correction.
[time=2860] And listen, here's my opinion.
[time=2862] I don't think the trouble with this issue is the paddle or not the paddle.
[time=2867] I think the trouble is how it gets done.
[time=2871] And I think rods of discipline have been used for hundreds of years wrongly.
[time=2878] I mean, rods of discipline have been used in anger.
[time=2882] Rods of discipline have been used with out of control moms and dads who aren't anywhere close to what God is asking for here.
[time=2890] But the notion that a rod of discipline can't be used in a loving, healthy way, I think, is erroneous.
[time=2900] And I'm saying that because it says so.
[time=2904] Right here that I am to use this and we could go on and on and on.
[time=2909] And I can show you, and I'm trying to show you here in the time we have the spirit and the heart behind it is to be one of great love and sensitivity and care.
[time=2920] The rod of reproof, the rod and reproof give wisdom.
[time=2925] We think the rod's going to make them hate us.
[time=2929] We think if we discipline them, they're going to just be scarred.
[time=2933] When actually the word of God says right here that the rod delivers wisdom to them.
[time=2939] And it helps them see and it helps them understand.
[time=2943] And they're thankful for us.
[time=2945] You saw it in Hebrews 12.
[time=2947] They respect the father who's willing to lovingly, the mother who's willing to patiently administer godly discipline.
[time=2957] But a child who gets his own way, oh, please read this, please write it down.
[time=2961] Please post it on your refrigerator.
[time=2963] Please put it in your car.
[time=2964] Please have it in your bathroom.
[time=2966] The child who gets his own way brings shame to his mother.
[time=2971] Go to a grocery store and watch.
[time=2976] Grown women embarrassed to the point of shame and anger.
[time=2987] Now here's the deal, after almost 20 years of parenting under my belt and countless experiences of watching you and me parent.
[time=2998] I'm going to just share this with you.
[time=3001] Again, from most of you, this is a reminder.
[time=3003] I think for some it might be new learning, but we all too many times fall into the extremes of discipline.
[time=3012] I tried my best this morning in the time that we've had to just kind of present the two extremes.
[time=3017] We all too many times fall into those two extremes rather than the balanced hard work and time required middle.
[time=3028] There is a place in the middle and it's called balanced hard work and time required.
[time=3035] And too many times we choose not to land there and we choose to land on the ends.
[time=3041] Here's a picture of it.
[time=3042] We've described it earlier.
[time=3043] Now we'll get visual.
[time=3044] There's a godly discipline graph.
[time=3047] On one end, you have afraid to, too busy to, or just selfish and lazy.
[time=3054] On the other end of the godly discipline continuum, you've got rage, anger, and you know what?
[time=3061] I'm going to scare them into compliance.
[time=3064] And that's the mindset.
[time=3066] Sadly, if too many who are living on that end, I'm just going to scare them to death.
[time=3072] And I'm going to yell loud enough and I'm going to kick some things and break some things and you watch them move.
[time=3076] They'll do what's right.
[time=3078] And then in the middle, you've got the balance, the hard work and time required middle.
[time=3085] Thoughtful firm, thoughtful firm discipline that loves them not toward compliance but toward trust and what?
[time=3094] Say it, obedience, there's a difference.
[time=3097] Oh, there is a difference between compliance and obedience, especially if we're talking about obeying God.
[time=3105] Oh, the tragedy of kids who grow up.
[time=3111] Enduring rage and anger and developing simply this compliance to do what God says I should do as long as they've got to.
[time=3121] Because watch what happens.
[time=3124] This won't be on the screen.
[time=3127] But on the one end, under afraid to, too busy to, or just selfish and lazy, understand where that ends up.
[time=3134] Understand that that ends up with you looking foolish while your whole life is controlled by the whim of a three year old or a 10 year old or a, I mean, it just goes on.
[time=3144] Understand where that leads.
[time=3146] That just simply leads to foolishness and a life that you've abdicated so you've just given it off to a kid and now you spend your days chasing them around.
[time=3162] Early on, it's a grocery store.
[time=3164] Later, it's more.
[time=3165] On the other end, you've got rage and anger
[time=3172] and I'm gonna scare you into doing what you should do and understand this just upfront.
[time=3177] At least you gotta know this, where that ends up.
[time=3179] Where that ends up is you'll be alone someday.
[time=3184] Because who in this room, please raise your hand.
[time=3189] Who in this room wants to spend time with?
[time=3193] Who in this room wants to, by your own choice, be with that person?
[time=3198] I mean, if you had a choice, nobody.
[time=3200] Of course, nobody wants to be with you and there will be a day when no one will and you will be alone.
[time=3211] In the middle, please understand where God's words,
[time=3218] God's word talks about it in the Psalms, God's word talks about it in Proverbs.
[time=3221] In the middle, you know where that ends up?
[time=3223] That ends up with you blessed.
[time=3224] It ends up hard days, absolutely.
[time=3229] Hard lessons learned, you bet.
[time=3231] But when this is what characterizes your approach, you put yourself in a position by God's grace and with his help to experience the blessing of family, to experience the blessing of kids.
[time=3241] Who know you are not perfect?
[time=3244] Because you've been humbled with them but they also know you love them enough to keep trying to communicate what's right and what God requires and that there are parameters.
[time=3253] So don't be afraid to discipline.
[time=3258] The absence of it will kill them.
[time=3261] Be very afraid of over-disciplining.
[time=3265] The abuse of the principle will kill them.
[time=3271] I'm gonna ask Corbin to come up if he would and we're just gonna sing as we go.
[time=3277] I hope you'll write down Ephesians 6-4.
[time=3280] It says not to provoke.
[time=3282] I really hope you'll write this down.
[time=3285] Meditate and read and meditate and pray on Ephesians 6-4.
[time=3290] As this day comes to an end tonight, maybe in the morning you can do this.
[time=3296] Fathers don't provoke your children to anger.
[time=3299] You see it there on the screen.
[time=3301] Fathers don't provoke your children to anger.
[time=3306] (gentle music) To provoke means to confuse, frustrate or dismantle.
[time=3313] Don't do that.
[time=3314] But bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
[time=3319] Powering up without relationship, strictness without softness never, ever, ever works.
[time=3326] Bring them up in the discipline and the instruction of the Lord.
[time=3332] Oh, how I need his help.
[time=3337] And if there's anybody in the room who needs his help with that, would you stand?
[time=3345] And would you sing this with me this morning and Corbin as he leads you?
[time=3351] Sing it from your heart.
[time=3352] It's the cry of a parent today who desperately needs the Lord's help.
[time=3361] [MUSIC - 64 seconds]
[time=3432] Our Father in Heaven, that is the cry
[time=3438] of so many in the room today.
[time=3440] We've heard truth and we know in our hearts and souls, it's right and oh God, we need your help and we need your courage.
[time=3448] We need people to come around us.
[time=3450] We need to ask for help.
[time=3452] Oh God, we need the accountability of those that we live in community with and if we're not in community, if we're trying to somehow parent alone, God, please reveal the foolishness and the pridefulness of that.
[time=3466] Oh God, I love these friends and I pray that you would walk with them as they leave this place, give them a boldness and a courage, give them a softness in their heart where that's needed.
[time=3479] God, if there are those who need help and encouragement that would wanna pray with me or others this morning, we'd love to do that.
[time=3485] I pray you'd lead them down here to the front.
[time=3488] God, thank you for this time this morning.
[time=3490] Thank you for the great privilege of worship.
[time=3493] (upbeat music)
