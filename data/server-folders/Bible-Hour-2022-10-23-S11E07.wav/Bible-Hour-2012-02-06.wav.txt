[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=28] - To make this next hour or so that we have together, a huge inspiration for us to worship him in the next six days.
[time=36] Would you pray with me?
[time=37] God, you are worthy of our praise,
[time=44] morning, noon, and night, seven days a week.
[time=49] Your praise should be on our lips when we wake up in the morning as we move through our day when we lay our heads on our pillows at night.
[time=56] But God, I confess this morning that's not a natural thing for us to do.
[time=61] We have a sin nature that we struggle with and we get distracted and we get confused about what's most important.
[time=67] And I pray that you would help us to be 24/7 worshipers of you, always mindful of your presence, always mindful of a chance to bring a smile to your face.
[time=78] And God, I ask specifically for this next hour that we get to be together, that you would make it salve on the souls of people who've been beat up this past week.
[time=88] I pray that you would use this hour to help us get inspired about what the next six days of worship might look like.
[time=95] And I pray that you'd help us to never forget that our corporate worship and our individual worship is tightly connected and it can be a mutually beneficial thing in our lives.
[time=106] Pray that by your spirit's power, that would happen in each person's life more and more.
[time=110] And we pray all of this in the powerful name of Jesus.
[time=115] [AMEN] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 74 seconds]
[time=202] (gentle piano music) - Colossians 1, 15 through 20.
[time=214] He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
[time=219] For by him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible.
[time=227] Whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things have been created through him and for him.
[time=235] He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
[time=240] He is also head of the body, the church.
[time=243] And he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he himself will come to have first place in everything.
[time=250] For it was the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in him, and through him to reconcile all things to himself.
[time=259] Having made peace through the blood of his cross.
[time=263] Through him, I say, whether things on earth are things in heaven.
[time=268] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 559 seconds]
[time=836] It's a clap for God together.
[time=839] [MUSIC]
[time=844] Let's sing one more chorus together, the reminders of the truth.
[time=849] And if God is for us, no one and nothing can be against us.
[time=855] Sing "If Our God is for us." [MUSIC - 133 seconds]
[time=994] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=997] It's great to be with you and I'm so excited about what God has been doing over these last five weeks here at Black Hawk.
[time=1003] It has been a tremendous start to the new year and specifically in this teaching series that we've been in entitled We Are Family.
[time=1012] We have spent the last several weeks looking at God's design for the family.
[time=1017] We've looked at husbands, we've looked at wives, we've looked at parenting.
[time=1021] And I wanna just draw your attention back to a week ago.
[time=1025] I hope, I hope all of you got a chance to watch that last message in the series by Jesse Hannah.
[time=1033] It was entitled Sticky Faith and it's about parents being able to pass along a faith that is sticky, a faith that is attractive, a faith that is real and meaningful to their kids.
[time=1048] Parenting especially adolescent kids today is such an enormous task.
[time=1054] It is a huge challenge and one of our ultimate responsibilities and I hope if you missed it, I hope you'll go to the website and go to blackhawkministries.org.
[time=1065] And I would invite you, I would invite you and your friends.
[time=1068] I would tell everyone you know who's trying to parent kids today to go to the website and watch Sticky Faith.
[time=1076] It's from the last Sunday in January and you're gonna absolutely love it.
[time=1082] And then secondly, I want you to do this.
[time=1084] I want you to be willing to think about coming on a Sunday morning, starting next week.
[time=1091] Jesse is leading a five week class for parents of kids from any age, but it's called Sticky Faith.
[time=1098] It is a five week class where he is going to interact with you on the challenges that parents are facing today, the way in which we can face those challenges with the truth of God's word and do it in a way that is authentic and genuine and real.
[time=1115] And I can't tell you how good it's going to be.
[time=1117] So come on Sunday mornings here at Blackhawk, Sticky Faith, you see the information right here on the bottom part of the screen.
[time=1123] If you have any questions at all about it, please call us and we'll steer you in the right direction.
[time=1129] But go to the website, watch the message, Sticky Faith.
[time=1133] Come on a Sunday morning and be a part of this class.
[time=1136] We'll make room for you.
[time=1137] We want you to come and be here.
[time=1139] We love what God can do in the heart of a parent as they invest truth and love into the life of their kids.
[time=1146] Hey, God bless you.
[time=1147] I hope today's message is an encouragement to you.
[time=1150] So thankful that you tuned in.
[time=1152] Have a great week.
[time=1153] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=1155] [MUSIC]
[time=1159] Allowing them to fail and be nagging them.
[time=1170] I think I want--
[time=1176] I have the tendency to have an urgency that they need to do it right now or it's going to affect them for the rest of their life.
[time=1184] Sometimes I find that one of the struggles would be trying to be a friend to the teenager instead of a parent.
[time=1193] You want to be the best buds, but that will come later.
[time=1196] You did help in giving us some proper times
[time=1203] for when we allow freedom, whether it's 13 or 15 or 18,
[time=1210] different levels of freedom for our children.
[time=1212] The class really gave me ideas and thoughts.
[time=1216] Jesse did a really great job of helping me understand the teenage mind.
[time=1221] I have a background in education, but it's elementary education.
[time=1225] I was a teenager a long, long time ago.
[time=1227] I don't remember how those things go.
[time=1228] Just reminds us how the kids are thinking, what he hears from them, so that we can kind of have a better idea of how to talk to them on their level.
[time=1236] The thing that most encouraged me in the class
[time=1244] was seeing Jesse's heart for the kids that came out in his teaching.
[time=1249] And just as vast knowledge, I was impressed with the amount of information that he brought to the table.
[time=1256] The biggest encouragement to me, sadly, was to hear that all the parents are facing the same struggles and it's not just me.
[time=1263] Because sometimes when you talk to your friends, their children seem great, but your children, the ones that have the struggles.
[time=1268] And it was great to hear everybody share.
[time=1270] Everybody being open, everybody being willing to talk about, I'm having trouble.
[time=1275] What do you think?
[time=1276] And giving answers that were genuine and empathetic.
[time=1279] One thing that we did as a result of the class that we took
[time=1287] is just reiterating to our son how much that we love him, no matter what.
[time=1293] No matter what he does, no matter what decisions he makes, no matter what stupid things he does, no matter what fun things he does, we love him.
[time=1301] That's the bottom line.
[time=1302] One thing I really remember doing is to verbalize what the child is feeling and empathize more with the feelings, but don't change your stance on things.
[time=1318] [MUSIC]
[time=1322] Just because you have children born in three decades, 70s, 80s, and 90s, doesn't mean you know what's going on.
[time=1328] Things are constantly changing, and you need to be aware of what's changing and learn all you can.
[time=1335] [MUSIC]
[time=1337] It's good.
[time=1342] I love what Sherry said there at the end, just because you had kids born in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, doesn't mean you know what's going on today.
[time=1347] I love the spirit that I see in so many of you that you want to keep learning.
[time=1352] You want to keep growing.
[time=1354] And so I would just encourage your parents, not too late.
[time=1357] Sign up this week, go online.
[time=1359] Call the office.
[time=1360] We'll get you in, and I can't wait to see what happens.
[time=1362] Next week, it starts.
[time=1363] First hour, they'd love to have you.
[time=1365] I hope many, many of you will do it.
[time=1367] Well, most of you, I would guess in the room, know the story of the great Apostle Paul.
[time=1375] And those of you that don't, that's all right.
[time=1378] This is a great time for you to catch up right here.
[time=1381] And the short version is this.
[time=1382] Paul was one of the great persecutors.
[time=1386] He was, as Saul, he was one of the great tormentors of the early church.
[time=1392] He was a hater of God, a devout Jewish leader
[time=1398] who rejected the message of Christ.
[time=1401] And he was unbelievably saved and transformed by God on the road to where?
[time=1409] Anybody?
[time=1410] Damascus.
[time=1410] He's on his way to Damascus, actually, to persecute the church.
[time=1415] And God comes in the light, and God dramatically, and absolutely saves him, calls him to himself.
[time=1423] And he turns Saul, he changes his name to Paul, and he turns him into a pastor.
[time=1429] Can you believe that?
[time=1430] And he turns him into a pastor, a church planter, if you will, who ended up spreading and proclaiming the very gospel.
[time=1438] He had once tried so hard to destroy.
[time=1442] From murdering Christians to ministering to Christians, this was Paul's story.
[time=1448] He established churches, went to great lengths, was faithful and diligent in his efforts, and established churches in places like Ephesus.
[time=1460] He went on and started a church in Galatia.
[time=1463] He went to Colossae.
[time=1465] He started a church in Thessalonica, and also in the city of Philippi.
[time=1471] And while each time, he would eventually move on from these places.
[time=1475] He was always willing and ready to write letters filled with God's words of wisdom, direction, and truth, letters back to these churches, back to those who led them and to those who were a part of those respective families.
[time=1493] That's how we get, many of you know, that's how we get the book of the letter of Ephesians, Galatians, Colossians, first and second Thessalonians, and Philippians.
[time=1507] Philippians, the book that we, the letter that we begin to study here this morning on Sunday mornings over the next eight weeks.
[time=1515] Philippi, the letter to the Philippians.
[time=1519] I want you to remember this morning that it was a real church, just like ours.
[time=1526] Filled with real people, just like you.
[time=1531] Real struggles, real heartache, real questions.
[time=1536] It was led by, founded by a real pastor, just like yours.
[time=1544] There are a lot of ways in which Paul and I aren't alike.
[time=1547] I hear he was short.
[time=1550] But I tell you what, I share with him one thing.
[time=1554] And that is he had this deep and profound desire
[time=1560] all that these people who he loved and cared for would become, would grow into and become all that God had created them to be as followers of his son.
[time=1571] And that is exactly what I want for you.
[time=1574] That every one of you, young and old alike, would allow the spirit of God and the word of God and the people of God to be used by God to grow you into everything he called you to be.
[time=1589] And so we come to this letter from Paul to his dear friends at the church in Philippi.
[time=1597] Now, real quick, let's talk about the challenge.
[time=1601] I want to just address this.
[time=1603] I've had some great conversations about this in recent days.
[time=1606] I want to address the challenge that we sometimes face when we jump into a passage by passage, verse by verse, page by page study of a book of the Bible.
[time=1619] Especially when the verse by verse page by page study comes on the heels of a five week series that we entitled, "We Are Family." What do I mean by that?
[time=1629] Well, one of the hurdles we'll face is that there may be some in the room.
[time=1633] And if this is you, it's okay.
[time=1634] Really, truly, I understand the thinking here.
[time=1637] I want to help you a little bit if I can, but I understand it, there are some in the room this morning who might get concerned by a book study of Philippians, a letter written by an ancient apostle to a church in 60 A.D.
[time=1651] Maybe, maybe you're thinking to yourself,
[time=1657] I don't think this is going to be as relevant as what we just went through.
[time=1663] You might even think you're signing up for something that could be boring.
[time=1670] So I had the guys load up the iPad with the top 12 soundtracks from Roman Greco movies over the last, no, just kidding.
[time=1679] I didn't, I didn't.
[time=1682] But I know, I know what you're thinking.
[time=1684] Some of you might be thinking, oh, but okay, but are you family, Kelly?
[time=1688] I mean, it was like right where I live.
[time=1691] You were talking about husbands and you were talking about wives and you were talking about parenting and you were talking about leadership in the home and I so identified with that.
[time=1702] Now you're thinking, that was real life stuff.
[time=1704] And I got excited about it.
[time=1707] What can I learn from, I can't even say it.
[time=1710] I mean, you're thinking, I can't even say it for Philippians.
[time=1713] So here's what I did.
[time=1716] I feel you.
[time=1716] And I just sat at my desk the other day and I just opened up Philippians.
[time=1723] It just took like 15 minutes, that's it.
[time=1727] And I just started reading just page after page.
[time=1732] I'd kind of just maybe skip a paragraph and read the next page.
[time=1735] I just randomly kind of went through Philippians and I wrote down, as I read, I wrote down the answers to questions that get asked by you and me.
[time=1752] I found in a few minutes answers to just these questions.
[time=1759] Will God ever give up on me?
[time=1763] Many of you in this room have asked that.
[time=1771] Many of us in this room, whether we've asked it or not, have certainly thought he should.
[time=1777] Will God ever give up on you?
[time=1781] How can God allow hardship?
[time=1785] How can God allow heartache?
[time=1788] I found as I went through the pages of Philippians, answers to questions like, "What does true commitment to Christ really look like?"
[time=1801] I mean, lived out in a life.
[time=1803] What does true commitment to Christ look like?
[time=1806] How does God use personal suffering for his good?
[time=1811] How does this work?
[time=1814] Personal suffering, somehow being leveraged for God's purposes, was Jesus really God?
[time=1827] Sort of an important question.
[time=1830] Was Jesus really God?
[time=1834] How can Christians make a difference?
[time=1837] I mean, a real difference in a corrupt and evil world.
[time=1841] How can those who love the Lord truly make a mark in a culture and society that is absolutely and utterly corrupt?
[time=1855] How much sacrifice is required today to really follow the Lord?
[time=1861] What is God's design for dealing with anxiety?
[time=1866] Do we have any anxious people in the room today?
[time=1873] What is the secret?
[time=1879] Love that phrase.
[time=1880] In other words, what is God's design for?
[time=1883] What is the secret for true contentment in life?
[time=1888] Should I keep going?
[time=1891] How irrelevant does that sound?
[time=1897] Are we bored yet?
[time=1900] I just want you to know, and I want to say it to you again.
[time=1904] I've been saying it for years, and I'll keep saying it for as many years as you let me.
[time=1907] The Word of God is so relevant.
[time=1910] The Word of God is so powerful.
[time=1913] The Word of God speaks to every issue in your life and mind, and oh, what a privilege.
[time=1918] Whether we teach the Word of God in a five-week series on the family, which was an absolute kick and God used it in powerful and profound ways, or whether we come to a book and go page by page, oh my goodness, what is contained in those pages?
[time=1934] We'll shape you and transform you and change you into all that God designed you to be.
[time=1941] And I can't wait, so what do you say?
[time=1943] Let's get started, open your Bibles.
[time=1944] If you brought them this morning, I hope you did.
[time=1947] If you need help with a Bible, let us know.
[time=1949] We'll get you one.
[time=1950] Absolutely, open to Philippians.
[time=1953] Galatians, Ephesians, and then right there in between Ephesians and Colossians, you will find Philippians.
[time=1960] And I want to start this morning right at the beginning, Philippians 1-1.
[time=1967] The first thing I want to show you is in that very first line, it says, Paul and Timothy, bond servants of Christ Jesus to all the saints in Christ who are in Philippi,
[time=1982] including the overseers, the elders and deacons.
[time=1986] I want you to see church this morning that as this letter begins, it is extremely important to Paul for some reason.
[time=1995] I think you'll see it here in just a moment that he identify himself as something.
[time=2000] And it says there, Paul, a bond servant of Christ.
[time=2006] Paul refers to Paul, Paul postures himself right out of the gate as a bond servant.
[time=2014] I want you to note, he doesn't say Paul an elder, he doesn't say Paul a leader, he doesn't say Paul a pastor, he doesn't say Paul an apostle, he doesn't say any of those things.
[time=2024] No, he uses the Greek word do-loss, and he calls himself a bond servant, which means the word do-loss in the Greek.
[time=2031] Listen, it means slave.
[time=2034] Paul calls himself a slave of Christ.
[time=2042] This word do-loss doesn't speak to the activity
[time=2048] of his service or the direction of his service.
[time=2051] He's not talking about with the use of this word, his service or his serving of the Philippians or of the Lord necessarily.
[time=2058] When Paul uses the word do-loss, this word speaks to ownership.
[time=2062] Now, please hear me.
[time=2066] Without speaking to the moral or social implications that come with our concept of slavery today.
[time=2075] I understand where our minds can go.
[time=2077] Let's not go there right now.
[time=2079] Let's not go to the civil war.
[time=2081] Let's not necessarily go to the abuses of masters and slaves.
[time=2086] Paul uses the analogy to powerfully illustrate that he was willingly posturing himself as one who is fully owned and utterly controlled by his master.
[time=2103] The Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2106] There's two things I want you to see with the use of slave.
[time=2110] Number one, Paul knows, Paul knows what 1 Corinthians 6-20 says.
[time=2116] He wrote it.
[time=2117] He would be very aware of what it says.
[time=2119] For you have been bought with a price.
[time=2124] You are not your own.
[time=2127] 1 Corinthians 6-20 informed the church at Corinth for you have been bought with a price.
[time=2132] By using this phrase, Paul makes it clear to the Philippians and to each of us this morning that by choice he is the absolute possession of Christ.
[time=2144] Christ has loved him, Christ has purchased him with a price, his life on the cross.
[time=2150] And Paul can never ever, ever, ever belong to anyone.
[time=2156] What else?
[time=2158] Property of possession of the Lord.
[time=2164] Dualos, slave.
[time=2167] Paul is also stating that as a follower of Christ he owes absolute as a dualos.
[time=2174] He owes absolute obedience to Christ.
[time=2179] I hope you'll write that down.
[time=2180] Absolute obedience to Christ.
[time=2184] That's how it works with a servant and their master.
[time=2190] The slave, as you know, has no plans or agenda of his own.
[time=2195] No, his master's intent must be his with this one word, dualos.
[time=2203] Paul declares that he is without rights and fully devoted to the desire and direction of his Lord and by the use of the phrase what is implied to those that Philippi and those here in the church that Blackhawk you should as well.
[time=2222] So how do we view yourself?
[time=2230] Think about it.
[time=2233] What do we call ourselves?
[time=2235] It's always an interesting discussion.
[time=2239] How do you, when you're talking about this,
[time=2245] how do you name us?
[time=2248] What phrases do you use?
[time=2253] Sometimes in our efforts to make it sound attractive.
[time=2258] I think sometimes in our efforts to make it sound interesting or maybe sometimes in our efforts to somehow make it sound acceptable.
[time=2267] We come up with all kinds of things.
[time=2270] Couple years ago flying home to Fort Wayne, sat down the plane and asked the guy next to me the same question I ask every person I ever fly next to, what do you do?
[time=2280] And he looked at me and he kind of took a deep breath and he kind of threw his shoulders back and he leaned over and said to me, I'm actually a, I'm a life enrichment consultant.
[time=2291] And I said, wow, that's great.
[time=2297] He said, what do you do?
[time=2298] And I said, I'm a pastor of a church in Fort Wayne and he went like this.
[time=2304] So am I.
[time=2305] And I'm like dude, just say it.
[time=2311] I'm a pastor, another name for it, I guess.
[time=2316] And we do that sometimes.
[time=2317] We name it different things.
[time=2319] And then there's the biblical names that we find right in the pages of scripture all of which are acceptable and appropriate.
[time=2326] There's born again, right?
[time=2330] Jesus used the phrase there to describe not the first birth but the second birth.
[time=2335] Not the one of flesh and blood, but of spirit.
[time=2338] When someone comes to faith in him, we get to be born again.
[time=2343] What a powerful picture and what a great phrase.
[time=2346] You read through the pages of scripture, you find Christian.
[time=2351] Many times I say I'm a Christian in Antioch.
[time=2355] They first got called Christians, little Christ's.
[time=2360] What a cool picture.
[time=2363] Follower of Christ, Christ follower.
[time=2365] We hear that oftentimes these days.
[time=2367] I love the picture of that believer, ambassador.
[time=2372] All very good, all very accurate.
[time=2374] When was the last time you called yourself a slave?
[time=2379] When was the last time that you referred to yourself
[time=2386] or saw yourself as a slave?
[time=2388] Let me ask you this morning.
[time=2389] Does God own you?
[time=2392] I mean, does he?
[time=2395] Is that how you see it?
[time=2397] Whatever he says, goes.
[time=2401] Whenever he says it, you're ready to roll.
[time=2405] Are you devoted to pleasing him?
[time=2408] Think about it, above all others.
[time=2411] 'Cause you know what's at stake?
[time=2413] Is that how you think or does he somehow
[time=2419] work for you, at least in your mind?
[time=2424] Is that how it is?
[time=2426] Is he like a genie in a bottle and you rub him and get what you want?
[time=2431] Or are you his slave?
[time=2436] Are you completely and utterly and forever
[time=2442] and always ready to serve at his beck and call out of the gate right here, Philippians 1-1, Paul sets us straight.
[time=2451] What a great, great picture.
[time=2453] Now, as this opening passage unfolds, I want you to see something here this morning.
[time=2458] Paul is, the something I want you to see is that Paul is profoundly grateful for what is happening with the gospel.
[time=2466] Paul is deeply encouraged by what he sees going on with the message of the church, the gospel, the good news about Christ.
[time=2476] You know what the gospel is, the good news about Jesus, his love, forgiveness, and the life people can have in relationship with him.
[time=2486] The ministry of the gospel was advancing.
[time=2489] Paul's fired up.
[time=2491] It was moving forward.
[time=2492] It was transforming people then just like it does today.
[time=2496] And I want you to quickly take note of two things this morning and the time that we have remaining.
[time=2501] I want you to see two things, two key factors and how the gospel goes forward.
[time=2507] You got it?
[time=2508] I want you to write this down, two key factors and how the gospel, the message of Christ goes forward.
[time=2513] We've been titled at the gospel's advancement.
[time=2516] The gospel's advancement.
[time=2517] The way, here you go, number one.
[time=2519] The way God designed it, my friends, don't know why he did, but he did.
[time=2523] Oh, he did.
[time=2524] The way God designed it.
[time=2528] People who have embraced Christ.
[time=2533] People who have themselves been transformed by the gospel.
[time=2538] People are the instrument that God uses to move the gospel forward.
[time=2545] I want you to write that down.
[time=2547] I want you to understand how, while mind boggling, it's true.
[time=2553] He stood there that day as he ascends into heaven and he looks at those guys, that ragtag group of nobodies and he says, "The kingdom's advancement is on you." Go make what?
[time=2569] Disciples, go move, you guys.
[time=2572] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[time=2573] I'm gonna help you.
[time=2575] The answer to every spiritual question I know is God, but now that we get right down to it, it's these people.
[time=2581] And it was that way then and it is that way today.
[time=2586] The gospel's advancement is something he has given you.
[time=2591] Responsibility for, opportunity in, oh, what a gift.
[time=2597] And Paul, here's the thing about this gospel advancement team of people.
[time=2603] Paul is confident.
[time=2606] I'm gonna show you verse six here.
[time=2607] Paul is confident because he knows, he's grateful, because he knows the God is going to keep growing his people.
[time=2614] His gospel advances will not be found lacking.
[time=2619] Look at one six.
[time=2621] He says, "For I am confident of this very thing." In verse three, he thanks God in all of his memory of them and what he shared with them.
[time=2632] In five, he's so grateful for their participation in the gospel.
[time=2638] Four, then he says in verse six, "For I am confident of this very thing that he who began a good work." There's the gospel, there's salvation.
[time=2646] He who began a good work and you will perfect it, will complete it, will see it through.
[time=2653] He'll keep developing you until the day of Christ Jesus.
[time=2658] Paul knew the gospel and its advancement
[time=2664] depended upon the people's willingness to obey.
[time=2667] And he knows that people who aren't growing don't do that, but he wasn't worried, he knew they'd keep growing because he was confident that he who began to work in them will continue to work in them, amen?
[time=2682] And I wanna make sure you understand this morning, you never get cut from the team.
[time=2692] You never get cut from the gospel advancing team.
[time=2697] He never, do you hear me?
[time=2700] He never, ever gives up on you.
[time=2705] He who started, remember, it was, remember, it was God who saved you and not we ourselves.
[time=2713] He who started the salvation work in you, he says here, he is going to complete it.
[time=2721] He is going to make you more like his son.
[time=2724] It might not be on your timeframe, it might include a number of events and circumstances that you and I both would have rather avoided, but you know what?
[time=2733] He who started a work in you will complete it.
[time=2738] He wants you on that team moving this message forward.
[time=2742] Listen, church, God is going to faithfully, relentlessly, always find ways to bring you to a place of deeper trust.
[time=2751] Has he done that with you?
[time=2755] Deeper obedience and a deeper awareness of your need for him because he's chosen you to move the gospel forward and for each of us to move it forward, we have to keep growing.
[time=2768] The gospel goes forward through people who God never gives up on.
[time=2775] Say amen if you're thankful for that, me too.
[time=2779] Number two, trials and heartache.
[time=2805] Trials and heartache are used by God to move the gospel forward.
[time=2815] Say, what do you mean?
[time=2818] Well, look at, look at verse 12, Philippians 1, 12.
[time=2823] Paul wants them to know, he says, now I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out
[time=2832] for the greater progress of the gospel.
[time=2836] Do you see that?
[time=2837] You say, well, what circumstance?
[time=2838] Well, look at 13, so that my imprisonment in the cause of Christ, stop right there, he wants them to know that this circumstance that he bumped into along the way has been used by God for the greater progress of the gospel, and the gospel, in other words, has been advancing through this circumstance, and then he says, the circumstances I got thrown in prison.
[time=2870] Rome is tired of Paul.
[time=2872] They are irritated and annoyed by his persistent, ongoing, unending message of Christ.
[time=2879] He eventually, now in short time, will lose his life for the cause, but now he wants them to know that this circumstance has been used by God for the greater progress of the gospel, so that my imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well-known throughout the whole Praetorian Guard and to everyone else, two things there, the Praetorian Guard would have been the imperial army, the imperial troops, hundreds of them who would have over time made their way through a rotation of watching over and guarding Paul, these were hundreds of Roman soldiers who were now being impacted for the gospel's sake because of this circumstance he would have never, ever wanted.
[time=2927] And not only the Praetorian Guard, I love the text here, it says, the whole Praetorian Guard and to everyone else.
[time=2935] Everybody, everyone watching,
[time=2941] you and I have been there before, you and I have been in situations where we have seen people, who we know, love, respect, you and I have seen people have to deal with a circumstance and you and I have sat there and we have said to ourselves, not in a critical way, but in a genuinely curious, hopeful way, wow, I wonder how they're gonna do that.
[time=2963] I wonder how they're gonna make their way through that 'cause we're gonna see a lot about what's in here
[time=2974] by the way they navigate that, oh my God, please be with them.
[time=2978] And there were just thousands of people who knew he was in prison, who knew who he was, they knew what his message was, they knew what he stood for.
[time=2990] And now as he stands faithfully, now as he's diligent to be who God called him to be, it makes a difference for the gospel's sake.
[time=2999] And that most of the brethren, this is great, verse 14, and that most of the brethren, trusting in the Lord, because of my imprisonment have far more courage to speak the gospel, to speak the word of God without fear.
[time=3017] Understand this, doesn't have to be Paul.
[time=3021] It doesn't have to be me.
[time=3024] When you stand for what's right, when you're willing in whatever your circumstance is, when you're willing to stand there and not bend, and when you're willing to stand there and articulate what needs to be said, when you're willing to show obedience instead of compromise, when you're willing, whoever you are, whatever that spot might be, there is somebody behind you going, wow, if he can do it, if she can do it, I can do it.
[time=3055] There are brethren, verse 14, who are becoming envisioned, emboldened, encouraged to stand as well, not fearing, as the text says, imprisonment, not fearing the loss of life, 'cause he did it, I can do it.
[time=3072] And that's what happens when in your faithfulness and in your boldness and in your trust in him, you're willing to walk forward.
[time=3083] Now here's what I want you to do.
[time=3086] I want you to come back with me, would you in the passage here, come back to 12, come back to verse 12, now Paul says, I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel.
[time=3102] I want you to read that to yourself, and I just want you to put yourself in that verse.
[time=3109] I just want you to, in your own life, in your own circumstance, in your own situation, I just want you to be able to like pretend that's you saying that.
[time=3118] So just kind of just, I'm gonna read it again, and you just picture yourself saying this.
[time=3123] Now I want you to know, brethren, that my, yours, circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel.
[time=3133] So that my, it says imprisonment.
[time=3138] I want you to put something else there.
[time=3147] Something you didn't want, something that you never would have asked for, something that's been hard, something that has really tested your faith.
[time=3161] I want you to be willing to put something there instead of imprisonment.
[time=3168] Don't think most of you, maybe there are a few of you who have been thrown in prison recently.
[time=3177] But I want you to figure out something else.
[time=3179] What is it?
[time=3179] Is it your sickness?
[time=3182] Is it your unemployment?
[time=3186] Was it your family crisis?
[time=3191] Was it a great loss that you encountered?
[time=3198] Be willing, I'm not saying you gotta have this all figured out today, but would you be willing this morning for the advancement of the gospel?
[time=3209] The message of hope and life and forgiveness for his sake and for the message of his son, would you be willing to say, so that my blank in the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the whole, throughout my circle of influence.
[time=3234] I hope so.
[time=3240] The advancement of the gospel brought great joy to Paul.
[time=3246] I'll tell you what, it brings great joy to me, especially when I see you and your willingness
[time=3255] to see and understand how tightly he holds you and to see and understand that the circumstances you endure can be used by him to make much of God and draw people to a hope and to a salvation
[time=3274] that can utterly change and transform them.
[time=3276] Would you stand and let me pray for us this morning?
[time=3281] When I asked Corbin, if he'd come and just play for a minute and as he comes and plays, I wanna just share this with you as we go.
[time=3294] Wow, I just was so encouraged.
[time=3297] My friend Rod sent this to me last week and I was reading it and I wanna just end our time with this picture for you this morning, this idea of do-loss and how we view ourselves.
[time=3308] Paul helping us to understand that we need to view ourselves as a slave of Christ.
[time=3315] You know, in that day, in Philippi, in that culture, there were those masters who owned slaves and when a master would die, his household, his servants,
[time=3330] there was a sense where they could be freed unless if they wanted to stay on in service to him
[time=3342] who was now dead, the only way they could do it is if they worked out an arrangement with his son.
[time=3350] The son would be the one that the servant,
[time=3356] do-loss, would connect himself with and if they could make an agreement, the servant would go before the judge and say, I'm with him and I wanna be with him for the rest of my days and they would take the servant, the do-loss and that son would take him to the doorpost of the home and he would literally put his earlobe on the doorpost and they would drive a piercing through his lobe and in that lobe would go a ring and that ring would be a seal.
[time=3397] This signature, if you will, from the son and from the servant to the son, that now we're together, me serving you and no father in heaven
[time=3411] we stand this morning and we just ask you for the courage so many of us need it, the courage to lay down our lives, put our earlobes on a doorpost and beg your son to come and claim us as his own.
[time=3427] Oh father, we commit this morning, our service, our gratitude, our allegiance, our obedience to you, our master.
[time=3438] We're grateful that you're a good one.
[time=3440] We're thankful that you're a kind one.
[time=3442] Oh God, we're so thankful that you're a merciful one and in that father, we rejoice.
[time=3450] Bring us back together next week as we continue to make our way through this book of the Bible, this letter from Paul that has for us God the very things that we desperately need and all the people who agreed with the prayer said,
[time=3465] [AMEN] - As longtime Black Hawk family members, Elmer and Darlene Johnson appreciate the opportunity to support the Bible hour by helping to underwrite a broadcast.
