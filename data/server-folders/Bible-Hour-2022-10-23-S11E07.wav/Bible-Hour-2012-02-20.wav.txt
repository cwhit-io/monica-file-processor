[time=171] Jesus
[time=201] Be the center of our lives, Be the place we fix our eyes, Be the center of our lives.
[time=230] We lived our eyes to heaven. We wrap our lives around your life. We've lived our eyes to heaven to you.
[time=269] Oh Christ, be the center of our lives, Be the place we fix our lives, Be the center of our lives.
[time=285] Oh Christ, be the center of our lives, Be the place we fix our lives.
[time=296] Be the center of our lives. We've lived our lives to heaven. We wrap our lives around your life. We've lived our lives to heaven to you.
[time=326] Be the center of our lives. We've lived our lives to heaven. We've lived our lives to heaven. We've lived our lives to heaven.
[time=345] You are only one I need.
[time=351] You are only one I need. We've lived our lives to heaven. We've lived our lives to heaven. We've lived our lives to heaven.
[time=373] We've lived our lives to heaven. We've lived our lives to heaven.
[time=384] You are only one I need. We've lived our lives to heaven. We've lived our lives to heaven. We've lived our lives to heaven.
[time=474] In Christ alone, my hope is found. He is my light, my strength, my song.
[time=486] This cornerstone, this solid ground, turn through the fuses, drown in stone.
[time=497] What lights above what depths of years, when fears are still, when strife is seized,
[time=508] by comfort or by all in all, here in the love of Christ I stand.
[time=535] Oh, Christ the star, like I stand. Oh, I have the power to sing He said.
[time=544] Oh, love the crown, His thinking said, my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=557] And tear not across the sweetest frame, but all you need, on Jesus' name.
[time=569] And when darkness seems to hide His face, I rest on Him, some changing grace.
[time=578] In every high story again, my anchor holds within the veil.
[time=591] Christ the star, like I stand. Oh, I have the power to sing He said.
[time=599] Oh, love the crown, His thinking said.
[time=608] Hey, the sun found, Jesus. Oh, Christ the star, like I stand. Oh, I have the crown, His thinking said, my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus.
[time=615] Oh, Christ the star, like I stand. Oh, I have the power to sing He said.
[time=620] Oh, Christ the star, like I stand. Oh, I have the crown, His thinking said, my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=628] His thinking said, my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood, His thinking said, my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=645] No guilt in life, no fear in death. This is the power of Christ in me, from life's first cry to final breath.
[time=663] Jesus commands my destiny. No power of hell knows He no man can ever mark me from His hand.
[time=679] Phil he returns, or calls me home, here in the power of Christ I stand.
[time=694] Word is the land who has slain, holy, holy is He.
[time=709] Sing a new song to Him, 'cause it's on Him and His verses.
[time=723] Holy, holy, holy is the love of our lives, who was the means of His power.
[time=737] With all the days that I sing, praise to the King of Kings, you are my everything, and I will adore you.
[time=752] Holy, holy, holy is the love of our almighty, who was the news and news to come.
[time=764] Yeah, with all the angels I sing, praise to the King of Kings, you are my everything, and I will adore you.
[time=781] Holy, holy, holy is the love of our lives, who was the means of His power.
[time=793] Yeah, with all the days that I sing, praise to the King of Kings, you are my everything, and I will adore you.
[time=823] A cavalry's mountain, wonderful morn, walked Christ my Savior, weary and warm,
[time=845] bracing for sinners, death on the cross, that He might save them from endless loss.
[time=858] Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer, seems now I see Him on cavalry's tree, wounded and bleeding.
[time=873] For sinners fleeting, blind and unheating, dying for King.
[time=888] Father forgive them, my Savior pray, even while His light blood flowed fast away,
[time=900] praying for sinners while in such war, no one but Jesus ever lost so.
[time=913] Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer, seems now I see Him on cavalry's tree, wounded and bleeding.
[time=928] For sinners fleeting, blind and unheating, dying for King.
[time=941] Dying for He.
[time=950] Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer, seems now I see Him on cavalry's tree, wounded and bleeding.
[time=966] For sinners fleeting, blind and unheating, dying for King.
[time=980] Oh, how I love Him, save your end friend, how can my praises ever find and through years are numbered?
[time=996] On heaven's shore, my song shall praise Him forevermore.
[time=1006] Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer, seems now I see Him on cavalry's tree, wounded and bleeding.
[time=1021] For sinners fleeting, blind and unheating, dying for Me.
[time=1030] Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer, seems now I see Him on cavalry's tree, wounded and bleeding.
[time=1045] For sinners fleeting, blind and unheating, dying for Me.
[time=1063] I have to tell you, we're going to be in Philippians chapter 2 this morning, there's an outline in your bulletin.
[time=1069] If you got one, I just have to full disclosure, I have to tell you that this passage has completely wrecked Me in every possible good way.
[time=1080] I'm overthrown by it.
[time=1082] I'm overwhelmed by trying to describe this to you in the time allotted and completely inadequate to do it anyway.
[time=1091] If you have your Bibles, this will not be on the screens before you, but go over to Colossians chapter 1.
[time=1101] I wanted to, I always love it when I get to really put some feet to what I've actually sung.
[time=1110] And that song by Charlie Hall and Matt Redmond's Center, I love that song, I love it because it's right out of the New Testament.
[time=1118] And I'll just specifically look at Colossians 1, 15. I think this is actually a really good introduction to Philippians 2, 1 through 11, what we're going to be this morning.
[time=1126] But I'm in Colossians, Colossians is right after Philippians, go eat, pop, corn, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, if that helps you.
[time=1135] Colossians chapter 1 and verse 15, you never know.
[time=1141] Colossians 1, 15. He is the image of the invisible God.
[time=1147] He refers back to the beloved son of Colossians 1, 13.
[time=1151] We're talking about Jesus, the firstborn of all creation.
[time=1155] For by Him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible.
[time=1163] Whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things were created through Him and for Him.
[time=1173] He is before all things and in Him all things hold together, He holds everything together, we sang that.
[time=1180] He is the head of the body, the church, He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead.
[time=1185] That in everything He might be preeminent, yours might say that He might have first place in everything.
[time=1193] For in Him all the fullness was pleased, the fullness of God was pleased to dwell and through Him to reconcile to Himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven.
[time=1206] And here's where I just start shortening out in my head, making peace by the blood of His cross.
[time=1217] Corbin drew a treble cleft for us last week and put it up on the screen, so there's another musical term called "day crescendo".
[time=1224] Do you ever watch Little Einstein's?
[time=1226] You see those musical terms? "day crescendo" means what? It gets quieter, right?
[time=1231] So he's the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, and at the end he's shutting his blood on a cross.
[time=1240] Friends, there is no analogy, there is no clever analogy I could give to you to adequately describe the lowering that Christ undertook.
[time=1251] It is not possible. It is overwhelming, it is humbling to be sure, and I have to tell you, I have to tell you this morning,
[time=1260] it's the most wonderful news I could possibly tell you that He did do this, because there was no other way.
[time=1265] There was no other way for the need before God that I have to be met, there was no other way, and He did it willingly.
[time=1273] It's truly overwhelming, it's truly encouraging, I think.
[time=1278] The hymn, "Thou didst leave thy throne", do you guys know that hymn?
[time=1285] I'll change some of the King James pronouns to make it a little bit more understandable, but you did leave your throne and your Kingly crown when you came to earth for me, but in Bethlehem's home was there found no room for your holy nativity, and the chorus is, "O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
[time=1305] there is room in my heart for the," what a beautiful thing to consider this morning.
[time=1311] That's Philippians 2, 1 through 11. That's this great emptying of Himself, this lowering of Himself.
[time=1319] I need to pray about this, I need to pray with you, please pray with me as we approach God's Word together.
[time=1327] Father, I stand in awe this morning at the truth of your Word.
[time=1339] I am overwhelmed at my own inadequacy.
[time=1344] I confess with my friends, my sisters and brothers in the room this morning,
[time=1352] my great need for you, my overwhelming, overwhelmingly great joy that you have made peace,
[time=1362] the blood of your Son. Father, this morning we need open ears, eyes, hearts that are soft and responsive.
[time=1373] Would you make it so?
[time=1375] Would you please help us to understand what you said in your Word that we might love and serve you,
[time=1381] that we might love and serve others in the way that you would have us to do that?
[time=1386] May there be room in our hearts for you today. We ask all these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1394] We will be in Philippians chapter 2 this morning, 1 through 11.
[time=1398] Would you please stand with me as we read the passage and you'll see what we're in for.
[time=1403] I think that fastening your seat belts would be appropriate if you have them.
[time=1411] Philippians 2, 1 through 11 are going to read through it, it will be on the screen behind me if you don't have a Bible. With you, Kelly has said in recent days, if you don't have a Bible, we will get you one and he means it. So if you don't have a Bible and you want one, would you please personally come see me when we're done this morning and I will walk you to a Bible and I'll put it in your hand. There could be no greater gift that we could give you.
[time=1433] Philippians 2, 1 through 11. So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection,
[time=1444] and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love,
[time=1450] being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from rivalry or conceit,
[time=1459] but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.
[time=1465] Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.
[time=1471] Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus,
[time=1477] who though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God, a thing to be grasped,
[time=1484] but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men,
[time=1491] and being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death,
[time=1497] even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him
[time=1503] and bestowed on him the name that is above every name.
[time=1507] So that the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
[time=1514] and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God, the Father.
[time=1520] Amen. Would you have a seat, please?
[time=1527] There's a lot to say here, and Philippians 2, 1 through 11 in your outlines, the notes I think is basically about a couple of things.
[time=1537] The first part of our section today is about Christ's encouragement.
[time=1545] You may have been here last week, and Kelly talked to us about the end of Philippians 1 last week, and if I could take you back there just for a minute, because Philippians 1 comes before Philippians 2.
[time=1555] I'll give you a second to process that, and then we'll get there.
[time=1559] Verse 29 of Philippians 1, you'll see how very nicely these things work together.
[time=1566] I think it's weird to receive a letter from someone and only read the second page,
[time=1573] but we do that sometimes. With the Bible, we jump in, we jump out, we jump out, we jump in, we jump out. As often as you can, read through these things in one sitting.
[time=1583] You can read through Philippians in about 10 minutes, and it will be time, each time you come to the gathering, I would encourage you to read Philippians before you come, so you have a sense of the whole picture that Paul is painting, and we only have time to go through these 11 verses today, but I think it will be good to do that.
[time=1600] Again, we're at the very end of Philippians 1 here, verse 29.
[time=1604] It's been granted to you that for the sake of Christ, you should not only believe in Him, but also suffer for His sake.
[time=1613] Engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had, and now here that I still have, Paul is writing Philippians from prison, likely in Rome.
[time=1622] Under very difficult circumstances, he has a perspective that Philippians 1 makes clear to us that of his current situation is not what defines his state of mind.
[time=1635] His life, his state of mind, his joy is not contained to or bound up in his circumstances,
[time=1643] which is a very good reminder for us, because I can often only stay with this far in front of my face.
[time=1648] My circumstances are driving my state of mind. That's not a biblical perspective, and Paul is helping us with that even today. He begins in verse 1 of chapter 2
[time=1659] by talking about encouragement. What an appropriate thing to say to people who are suffering.
[time=1665] He doesn't say, "Listen, you guys are going to suffer. It's going to be really, really hard.
[time=1668] I'm all the way over here, so good luck." That's not what he says.
[time=1674] He gives him this incredible truth about a common experience of comfort
[time=1681] follows after a common experience of suffering.
[time=1684] Kelly said that unified suffering trumps individual ease last week.
[time=1689] He's right. It's exactly what Philippians 1 is saying.
[time=1692] And then Paul is saying in response to that, "The God knows what you need." He knows exactly what you need. And we've read Colossians 1, and now we've read Philippians 2, friends. I would just say this to you as we begin this morning.
[time=1706] I would just say this to you.
[time=1709] I know that you've probably had these moments in your life where you've wondered, "God, where are you?" in my suffering.
[time=1717] What's going on? I don't understand it.
[time=1720] This is not going the way that I planned it to go, and I'm not happy about it.
[time=1726] I need to tell you that if you have any trace of that in your spirit, and I bet you, if you're honest, a lot of you have at some point in your life, remember this. The answer to your question, "Does God think about me? Does God care about me?
[time=1738] Does God have any idea what's going on in my life?" Your answer to that is the cross.
[time=1742] He is fully aware of your suffering.
[time=1746] His son, watch, has participated in it.
[time=1751] So don't think he's far away. He is not silent. He is not distant.
[time=1756] Paul said that to the people in the Ariapagos. He's closer than my very words are to you right now.
[time=1764] Therefore, you may be your says "therefore" in verse one there.
[time=1768] I'm not sure when you're looking at it, but the word that I'm reading from is so sense in which the Paul is talking about what's gone before in forms that we're doing right now. And the word there is "if." So if there is any encouragement, any participation, any affection, he's provoking them.
[time=1787] Is it to say, "Is there any of these things among you?
[time=1791] Does it look this way for you? Does it not look this way for you?" The encouragement in Christ has to be seen again through the lens of suffering, but that's how they're going to see it. See it with this perspective.
[time=1803] You can do it. God knows what you need and he knows how you need it and he will provide for your needs.
[time=1811] I'll say it again and I'll wait for you to respond.
[time=1815] God knows what you need and he knows how you need it and he will provide for those needs every single time. Okay, that's good. You're there. That's good.
[time=1823] Verse one, "Any encouragement from Christ made for the Holy Spirit describe as a periclete." Not a periclete, but a periclete coming alongside someone who, that's what the word means, someone who comes alongside. So if you have any encouragement, the word encouragement is not a tough word to define. It means to give somebody else courage to embolden them in some course of action.
[time=1847] You can do it. Christ has willed that you should suffer as his follower and if he tells you you're going to suffer, he will also allow you, some familiar to you, a way to get through it, a way of escape from temptation. He will allow you to suffer well.
[time=1867] He didn't promise that you would not suffer.
[time=1871] In fact, friends, this is what I would say in light of Philippians 1 and 2.
[time=1875] That my prayer should often, more often not be, "God, get me out of this suffering, but my prayer should probably more often be, "God, help me to suffer well." That I realize, as I say that, that's a very weighty thing for me to say. I don't say it lightly.
[time=1895] Any comfort from love, Paul says in verse 1, "Comfort from love." Here in your outline, friends, we're talking about his encouragement in verse 2 to be unified. So watch what this all works together.
[time=1911] A Roman number 1 is his encouragement, then we have this be unified. Any comfort from love, a baby needs to be comforted and when it's mother or maybe father, but definitely mom, holds the baby, there's a sense in which the baby is crying, the baby stops crying at some point. Eventually, the baby will hopefully stop crying. It needs to be held to be comforted.
[time=1935] Solace afforded by love is what this word "comfort." It means it's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.
[time=1943] This is the father's role here. We have encouragement in Christ who come from love, through the father.
[time=1951] People are attracted to this in this verse. It's a father-son-spirit thing going on.
[time=1955] I'm attracted to that.
[time=1959] In the spirit, this is the word "conania." You made for that word before.
[time=1963] Fellowship. Let me talk for a minute about smaller settings, because I mentioned last week that you need that. This is a good thing. For us to be in here right now, together is a good and appropriate thing. We're not going to stop doing it.
[time=1975] It's part of what we are doing, what God's called us to do. But this is not enough. This hour together or so is not enough in your spiritual life. Growing churches are filled with growing people.
[time=1987] We want you to be growing people, and you're going to need more than this 80 minutes or so can provide. Because there's not as much of this. There's a lot of this. There's as much of this going on, person to person. A smaller setting, a grow group, a Sunday morning community, a small group, meets during the week.
[time=2007] Please go to our Welcome Center. Please talk to me. Call the church.
[time=2011] If you want to get plugged in, you can't. I've lost people who are new to this church, you can get involved, get involved. You have to want to. If you want to, we will help you. You need that. You need coinonia. Fellowship.
[time=2023] Participation, one with another. So people can pray for you and know what you need. When you're in trouble, they'll know. And they can call you and say, "How can I help?" I might not know. I want to know.
[time=2035] I might not. That's why you need each other. I'm here to equip you to do the work of the ministry. That's my job. Part of my responsibility before you, my calling from God, your job is to do it. And I'm encouraging that this is how you do it, together in smaller settings. The next word is my favorite word in this verse and it's the word affection. The Greek word is splachnon.
[time=2059] Isn't that fun to say? Splachnon. Do you know what it means?
[time=2063] My students know what it means. It means guts. It means your intestines. Corbin didn't draw two sets of intestines up on the screen and drew two hearts, right? Because we say, I love you with all my heart. I know it and I know what you mean if you say that. I'll say, I love you with all my intestines. I wouldn't say that to you. It wouldn't look nearly as good in a valentine's card.
[time=2083] Probably, I wouldn't say. Love you with all my innards.
[time=2087] But that's what it means. Because the Greco-Roman world said when they had affection, they felt it. You ever been there?
[time=2095] Just felt it down in here when she walks in the room, guys?
[time=2099] Do you feel it? It's, right? It's affection.
[time=2103] Listen, this is an appropriate thing for people to experience. This feeling, I have to know.
[time=2111] I have to know what's going on to feel that way about you. Do I rejoice with those who rejoice? Is your victory my victory?
[time=2123] Is your suffering my suffering? That's not going to happen in this big room.
[time=2127] This is a good place for us to be. I want to say it again. This is really good.
[time=2131] But you need to be with people who are living life on life with you who know when you're having a hard time and can pray for you intelligently and be affected by you. Have sympathy for you. Tenderness, maybe your translation says.
[time=2147] Verse to you. So, if you have all this, encouragement, participation, sympathy, completion, complete my joy, by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord, being of one mind, by being unified, letter A in your outline.
[time=2167] It's what we're setting our minds on. Set your minds on the same thing. Paul encourages unity of thinking, guys, but also unity of feeling. Do you feel the same way about things? Thinking is fine.
[time=2183] I'm going to have A, B, C, D, E, F, and G all end up in my mind. I think the same way.
[time=2187] I have all the right answers. But do I feel the same way? That's not really what he's encouraging.
[time=2191] He's piling on. There's no doubt what Paul is after. Paul is after. Look at that verse. Look at verse 2 again. Complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being of full accord, and then again of one mind.
[time=2211] There's no place for all the things that sometimes bog us down friends when we're doing this.
[time=2219] And now verse 3.
[time=2223] Verse 3. Do nothing from rivalry or conceit. You know what the word nothing is in the original language? Nothing.
[time=2231] Nothing?
[time=2235] Do nothing from rivalry or conceit.
[time=2239] But in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Verse 4. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. Screw tape letters by C.S. Lewis. Do you guys know that book? It's a well-known book where he's writing a fictional account of a senior devil counseling a younger devil as the younger devil has been assigned to this guy to keep him from what they call the enemy from God. You following me?
[time=2271] Okay. So this is what the older devil is telling the younger devil about how to keep his subject from falling into the hands of the enemy which is from their perspective God. This is remarkable.
[time=2283] God wants to bring the man to a state of mind in which he could design the best cathedral in the world and know it to be the best. Rejoice in the fact without being any more or less or otherwise glad you've done it than he would be if you had been done by another person.
[time=2299] He wants him in the end to be so free from any bias in his own favor that he can rejoice in his own talents as frankly and gratefully as his neighbor's talents.
[time=2311] Or in a sunrise. Or an elephant.
[time=2315] Or a waterfall. He wants each person in the long run to be able to recognize all creatures even himself as glorious and excellent things. When they are really learned to love their neighbors as themselves they'll be allowed to love themselves as their neighbors. Free from any bias.
[time=2335] That's what God wants. No bias in my own favor. That's high guys. That's a really high bar. Nothing from rivalry or conceit.
[time=2343] Conceit is maybe your says empty conceit. Vane glory is how the King James used to say it.
[time=2351] Vane glory. Rivalry is selfishness.
[time=2355] Selfishness. The new living says don't live to make a good impression on others.
[time=2363] How much of my life is spent trying to make a good impression on other people? How much of your life is spent trying to make a good impression?
[time=2375] It's even a jingle in a commercial. Ouch.
[time=2379] It's not a false modesty though.
[time=2383] These verses aren't talking about do nothing for yourself.
[time=2387] This is not an Eora mentality. Oh I'm having such a bad day. Do you guys know who Eora is? I got no response in the first hour. I guess I'll go down.
[time=2399] Okay, some nodding heads. Okay. That's false. That's like looking down on yourself. It's false modesty. That's not what Paul's after here.
[time=2407] Paul wants us to have a proper view of himself, of ourselves. I know exactly who I am and what I'm not.
[time=2415] True humility is focused, is not focused anywhere. It's focused outward.
[time=2423] Putting other people's needs ahead of our own.
[time=2427] I just can't help but wonder guys what our families, what our church, what our schools would look like if we took these verses again as seriously as we pretend to.
[time=2439] Nothing from rivalry. Nothing from conceit.
[time=2443] Your needs are more significant than my needs.
[time=2447] How much marital strife can you imagine under those circumstances? Not very much.
[time=2455] If we took it seriously, if we begged God to help us.
[time=2459] Verse 4, with me.
[time=2463] Let each of you look not only to his own interests. Look to your own interests, but not just to your own interests. Also to the interests of others.
[time=2475] This is the consideration of the excellencies in somebody else's character. This is encouragement.
[time=2483] I need that desperately.
[time=2487] I'll bet you do too. I need to be encouraged.
[time=2491] Because life is hard.
[time=2495] Serving Christ. The suffering that comes with serving him is hard. It's taxing.
[time=2503] Where is fault finding? Where is accusation? Where is jealousy?
[time=2507] It goes away in those two verses.
[time=2511] It just doesn't even exist anymore.
[time=2515] In Ephesians 5, Paul tells husbands to love their wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.
[time=2527] Guys, that's the standard as husbands. That's what he's called us to.
[time=2531] Consider your wife's interests more significant than yours. Yeah, but no, yeah, but.
[time=2543] How easy it will be for wives to subject themselves.
[time=2547] How much easier, I should say. Not how easy.
[time=2551] How much easier it is for wives to subject themselves to a husband who loves them in that sacrificial way.
[time=2559] Those are a partnership, guys. It's not just one or the other. It works together. This is free marriage counseling. I can't tell you how important this is. How much of your kids bad behavior and your and your unpleasant response to it is about how it makes you look.
[time=2579] I'll ask the question again because it's worth repeating.
[time=2583] When your kids behave badly, I should say if because maybe yours aren't like mine, but if your kids behave badly how much of their bad behavior and your in your response to it is about how it makes you look.
[time=2599] My mindset should be how can I help them? Not you're making me look bad.
[time=2607] Are you hearing me parents? File that one away, okay? Because it will save your kids and you from lots of heartache.
[time=2615] You're making me look bad. If they ever sense that from you you're going to have struggles with building trust.
[time=2623] Be selfless. Let her be in your outline.
[time=2627] Be selfless.
[time=2631] Seth Godin was one of the presenters at last year's Leadership Summit with Willow Creek that we do here. Please come this summer. You will not regret it. I promise you. Kelly talks it up all the time and he should.
[time=2647] He's not a believer, but even he understands this.
[time=2651] This is what he said February 12th, but it's about nine days ago.
[time=2655] More often than not, the selfish person is insecure, fearful, and filled with doubt. The selfishness springs from his belief that this is his only good idea, his last dollar, his one and only chance to avoid failure.
[time=2671] "I need this, not you," the selfish person says. Because he truly believes he's got nothing else going on, no other chance, no hope.
[time=2683] The irony of course is that selflessness, not selfishness, is precisely the posture that leads to more success.
[time=2691] The person with the confidence to support others and to share is repaid by getting more in return than his selfish counterpart.
[time=2699] Sharing your money, your ideas, your insights, your confidence, all these things return to you, maybe not in the way you expected, and not with a guarantee, but again and again the miser falls behind.
[time=2711] In Mark chapter nine, Jesus is walking to Capernaum with the disciples, and he can see they're talking. He knows that kind of stuff.
[time=2723] He was what he was talking about. They just kind of are quiet, they don't say anything.
[time=2727] And it comes out, they were talking about which one of them was the greatest.
[time=2731] They were talking about the discipleship, championships, series, standings, where they stood.
[time=2735] And that was a joke. And where they stood in those beginnings and they didn't come to good things.
[time=2743] He goes, "Guys, I almost seem to kind of go like this." Listen, guys, if you want to be great, be a servant.
[time=2755] So he goes into the house and takes a little kid and puts him on his lap and makes much of this child, men didn't do that in those days, but Jesus did.
[time=2767] If you want to be first, be last.
[time=2771] It's completely counterintuitive.
[time=2775] Verse five is the beginning of the second part of Philippians chapter 2, 1 through 11. Christ's humility is the point on your outline, Roman numeral 2, Christ's humility.
[time=2787] So in light of all that, now we have this.
[time=2791] Have this mind among yourselves, yours might say attitude, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant.
[time=2815] Wow. Behavior in keeping with Jesus.
[time=2819] Verse five says that.
[time=2823] These are theologically massive verses.
[time=2827] I cannot tell you how big and important these are. It says that he was in the form of God in verse six, and the word form there is the word that we get the word morph from.
[time=2839] It means the exact and true nature of something.
[time=2843] It doesn't mean that he was sort of God, but not really.
[time=2847] The people who come to our houses knocking our doors all dressed the same way. They think it means he was sort of God, but not really God.
[time=2855] It's not what Philippians 2 says. It's not what John 1 says. It's not what Colossians 1 says.
[time=2859] It's not what Hebrews 1 says. He's the Radians, Hebrews 1, 3.
[time=2863] He is the radiance of the glory of God. The exact imprint to ring picture. The exact imprint of his nature.
[time=2871] He wasn't less, he's never been less than God. He never will be.
[time=2877] The form of God means that he has the essential characteristics of God and never lost him.
[time=2885] He was characterized but was essential to being God.
[time=2889] That's the force of it.
[time=2893] This is who he is, and he doesn't count that something to be grasped.
[time=2901] He doesn't think it's a thing that he can exploit to his advantage.
[time=2905] It's a hard word to define. That word grasped.
[time=2909] Didn't count it robbery with God and old translation says. It's a hard word.
[time=2913] Only used once in the whole Bible. We now know it means something like this.
[time=2917] It means he didn't take his position and use it to his own advantage. Jesus didn't do that. And how often do I have that temptation?
[time=2929] Every day. So let our A in your outlines, friends, let go.
[time=2933] Let's follow his example. What are you clutching on to?
[time=2937] To exploit, to use for your own advantage.
[time=2941] To make it better for you. Well, I'm right and she's wrong and I'm hanging on. I'm hanging on.
[time=2949] Let it go. Jesus didn't count equality with God a thing to be grasped. What do you have to let go of?
[time=2961] I don't know. I promise you the Holy Spirit will do work on you to help you figure that out. I promise you it's not that.
[time=2969] Nobody had more to lose than Jesus. He did it willingly.
[time=2973] What are you clutching on to? Bitterness or anger or regret or hurt from years ago. Let it go. You can trust him.
[time=2989] He made himself nothing, verse 7, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.
[time=2997] Jesus didn't have to come and subject himself to infancy.
[time=3001] To diapers and teething and all of that.
[time=3005] But he did. He subjected himself as a baby. Why? He didn't have to.
[time=3013] He could have shown up as a fully grown man.
[time=3017] Let's do this. Let's not what he did.
[time=3021] He was here for 30 years.
[time=3025] Plus, he didn't have to, but he did.
[time=3029] Do you doubt that he loves you?
[time=3033] I'll bet you do. Sometimes don't.
[time=3037] Does he love me or not? This is your answer.
[time=3041] He has given you that answer. He became obedient to death on a cross. Verse 8 says that to us.
[time=3049] The Romans would crucify people not far away, like up on top of a mountain, so it was distant and you wouldn't ever see it.
[time=3057] People were crucified outside the city gates, out of public place, out of public crossroads, about eye level.
[time=3065] Garbage, don't at them, spitting, all kinds of things.
[time=3069] That was the preferred method of execution by the Roman people, the people who were in charge of the land to which he was born. He didn't have to do that either. Crucifixion was a message by the Romans that we are in charge.
[time=3085] We can do what we like with you, and if you mess with us, this will happen.
[time=3089] So don't do it.
[time=3093] Even death on a cross.
[time=3097] The sharpest imaginable contrast, is the reality of God to a cross. The Romans would do things with graffiti, and a famous one has been found.
[time=3109] It's a picture of a donkey, a donkey's head on a man's body, hanging on a cross, because the Romans couldn't possibly explain or understand a crucified God.
[time=3121] They forgot to read the rest of the story. Philippians 2, 9-11.
[time=3125] Read that with me, 9-11. Therefore, God has highly exalted him and given him, bestowed on him the name it's above every name. At the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth, every knee. Every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God, the Father. This is probably my pointer to the Philippians own future.
[time=3161] So you can suffer well now because you have this, because of what Christ has done to look forward to. This is the only appropriate response to everything that we've read. This is the only appropriate response.
[time=3173] It's sent to bow down. Let her be in your outlines to bow down.
[time=3181] All gathered worship is dress rehearsal for eternity.
[time=3189] All of it is. We are practicing right now.
[time=3193] If you know him worship him with your heart, with your voice, with your money, with your time, all of it. If you don't know him.
[time=3205] Romans 10 says if you confess with your mouth, the Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead that you will be saved.
[time=3217] It would be full-hearty for me to read all that we've read and not give you an opportunity to respond.
[time=3225] And you don't need me to do that. God is working perhaps in your heart right now to respond to him in faith. Maybe for the first time.
[time=3233] I don't know.
[time=3237] Heaven's gates have been thrown wide open. And he is the key. Revelation 5, 1 through 5 gives us a picture of this.
[time=3249] It's an amazing picture. I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back.
[time=3257] Sealed with seven seals. I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice.
[time=3261] Who is worthy to open the scroll and break the seals?
[time=3265] Crickets.
[time=3269] If you have it on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or look into it, and I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look into it. And one of the elders said to me, "We've no more. Behold the lion of the tribe of Judah. The root of David has conquered so he can open the scroll and it's seven seals." He's done it. It's done.
[time=3297] In light of what he's done, he wants each one of us to respond to him for the first time or for the thousandth time.
[time=3309] Let me close with this illustration that I've found very helpful over the years. I don't think I've read it to you guys before, but if I have I need to hear it again.
[time=3321] The 8,000 mourners filed out of Vienna's St. Stephen's Cathedral and fell in line behind the cataphalk drawn by six black horses.
[time=3329] Two hours later, the procession ended at the Capuchin Church where, in keeping with tradition, a member of the funeral party knocked on the door and a priest asked, "Who goes there?" The titles were read, "Queen of Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia, Queen of Jerusalem, Grand Duchess of Tuscany and Krakow. I do not know her," said the voice, "a second knock.
[time=3361] Who goes there?" Brought the response, "Zeta, Empress of Austria, Queen of Hungary." Again the reply, "I do not know her." The question came a third time and the answer was simply "Zeta, a sinning mortal." "Come in," said the priest.
[time=3385] Opening wide the door, not for royalty, but for a faithful member of the church whose life had finally reached its end.
[time=3393] Would you pray with me?
[time=3397] Heavenly Father, I thank you for your son's encouragement
[time=3405] and for his example, his humility.
[time=3409] I thank you for the promise because he's asked us to be unified that we can be because he's told us to be selfless, we can be.
[time=3421] In light of his humility, we can let go whatever we're holding onto and respond to you rightly.
[time=3429] God, I beg you this morning, on behalf of the people in this room and anyone who's in the sound of my voice, your word says that if I confess with my mouth that your son is Lord and believe in my heart that he's risen from the dead, highly exalted that I will be saved, that anyone who prays that will be saved, I believe it, God. And so I pray for those who even right now, your spirits drawing them to yourself that you would be with them and you would bring them to us, that they would talk to us about that new creation that's happened in their life, that we could come alongside them and support them and oh Father, for those in the room who are already your followers, may we seek to love you and follow you and serve you in this way.
[time=3485] We ask all these things in Jesus' name and with great thanksgiving.
[time=3489] [AMEN]
