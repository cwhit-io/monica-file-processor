[time=492] - Well, hey, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=493] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Black Hawk and I have the privilege almost each and every week of spending these few minutes with those of you and our viewing audience.
[time=505] And I wanna say something to you today, to those of you in our viewing audience, you know that we've always considered you as part of our family.
[time=513] We care a great deal about you and what God is doing in your life.
[time=517] And I wanna say something to you this morning.
[time=520] I'm a little casual as you can see.
[time=523] Every once in a while you'll catch me doing an insert here for the broadcast and my sweats.
[time=530] Usually sometimes on those days I've got a bathing suit on because those are the days when I'm about to go into the worship center and we're about to celebrate the great, great miracle of baptism.
[time=542] That's right.
[time=543] Those who have fully surrendered their hearts and lives to Christ, kids, teenagers, young adults, moms and dads.
[time=552] It is an amazing experience.
[time=554] I've been in ministry for almost 25 years.
[time=557] I've never, ever gotten weary of the great joy of baptism, people standing in the water and sharing with our family how Christ has absolutely and utterly not only forgiven them but transformed them.
[time=572] That's right, God changes lives.
[time=575] And the New Testament commands that when one comes to faith in Christ that they would then be baptized as a public declaration of their faith.
[time=584] And it is so cool to watch people go into those waters and share with our family what God has done.
[time=591] And I want to say this to you.
[time=593] Today, for instance, there are several who will be in those waters getting baptized in front of our church family and their spiritual journey started with them in a living room or a bedroom somewhere turning on the TV and watching the Bible hour.
[time=610] That's right.
[time=611] The Bible hour has been for so many people, kind of the beginning point when God began to draw them to himself.
[time=618] And oftentimes, they'll watch the Bible hour for a while.
[time=623] They'll be drawn to not so much me or this place.
[time=627] They're drawn to the truth of God's word and what it says about their lives.
[time=632] And they begin to ask questions and they begin to think maybe I should go and actually attend a service.
[time=639] And so they walk through these doors and they come into this family and they're never the same.
[time=644] And I hope for you this morning, for any of you watching, wherever you are, whoever you are, whatever your story might be, I hope you understand that this isn't a mistake that you're watching and that I, in the weeks to come, would love nothing more than to meet you face to face it in person.
[time=660] Come at nine o'clock or 1045 on a Sunday morning and allow God and his word and his people and his spirit to continue to bring you down this road of spiritual change and transformation.
[time=673] It is an awesome thing to see.
[time=676] Well, I hope you have a great week.
[time=677] I hope today's message is a message that will encourage you.
[time=680] I hope that it'll help you understand more of what God has for you in this life.
[time=685] If we can help it all, please let us know.
[time=688] God bless you, have a great week.
[time=689] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=691] - This morning to help you prepare your hearts for the Lord's Supper, I wanna take you back to a story in the Old Testament in second Samuel chapter nine.
[time=701] We meet a man with a strange name, his name is Mephibosheth.
[time=706] And it's a real name.
[time=708] It was probably really cool back then.
[time=710] And it just sounds really strange to us right now.
[time=713] But Mephibosheth was his name.
[time=715] And this is a little boy who was crippled at age five and grew up and was crippled his whole life.
[time=721] And he was actually a grandson of King Saul.
[time=724] And back in the day, when King Saul's dynasty was over and King David's dynasty began, the rules of engagement were that King David would murder any descendants of the previous king.
[time=738] King David was not a normal king.
[time=742] He was a king after God's own heart and he chose to extend Mephibosheth, a seed of honor at his table.
[time=750] He didn't kill him.
[time=751] He offered him grace and kindness and love.
[time=756] One of our elders sent me an email about Mephibosheth a few weeks ago and I wanted to read you this email.
[time=763] It's a devotional about Mephibosheth in second Samuel chapter nine.
[time=768] Let me read it to you this morning.
[time=770] There's a beautiful story in the life of King David, illustrating God's grace to us through Christ.
[time=778] Mephibosheth was the son of David's friend, Jonathan, the son of Saul.
[time=783] He'd been crippled in both feet at age five.
[time=786] After David was established as king over all Israel, he desired to show kindness to anyone remaining of Saul's family for the sake of Jonathan, which is important, that's what the Bible tells us, motivated the king to do it for the sake of Jonathan.
[time=803] So Mephibosheth crippled and destitute, unable to care for himself and living in someone else's house, he was brought into David's house and ate at David's table like one of the king's sons.
[time=817] Why was Mephibosheth treated this way?
[time=821] It was for Jonathan's sake.
[time=823] We might say David's, excuse me, we might say Jonathan's loyal friendship with David earned Mephibosheth seat at David's table.
[time=832] Mephibosheth in his crippled and destitute condition, unable to improve his lot and wholly dependent on the benevolence of others, is an illustration of you and me, crippled by our own sin and unable to help ourselves.
[time=849] We're like Mephibosheth.
[time=850] David in his graciousness is an illustration of God the Father, the kind and gracious king.
[time=858] And Jonathan represents Christ, the one who died to make it all possible.
[time=864] Just as Mephibosheth was elevated to a place at the king's table for Jonathan's sake, so you and I today are elevated to the status of God's children for Christ's sake.
[time=876] And just as being seated at the king's table involved not only daily food, but other privileges as well, so God's salvation for Christ's sake carries with it all the provisions we need, not only for eternity, but for this life as well.
[time=891] This account in Second Samuel Mine begins and ends with the statement that Mephibosheth was crippled in both feet.
[time=901] He never got over his crippled condition.
[time=904] He never got to the place where he could leave the king's table and make it on his own.
[time=910] And neither do we.
[time=912] So this morning while we sing a few songs, I want you to have that picture in your head.
[time=920] The picture of you crippled by your sin nature that you were born into worthy of death because of the transgressions you've committed beyond that to break God's loss.
[time=931] And then because of Christ's death on the cross, you're no longer an outcast worthy of death, but you've been invited to eat every day at the king's table.
[time=944] So this morning we're going to a different table, a table that reminds us of Christ and how it was his blood and his bruised body that made it all possible.
[time=956] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 332 seconds]
[time=1298] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 252 seconds]
[time=1558] God, we praise you this morning because of your great sacrifice.
[time=1566] He gave your only begotten son to come to the world and live a perfect life but face a criminal's death so that we, your crippled and lame children,
[time=1581] could believe in him and not perish but have everlasting life at the king's table and our hearts are grateful.
[time=1590] [AMEN] If you take the bread,
[time=1602] for I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you
[time=1608] that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said this is my body which is for you.
[time=1617] Do this in remembrance of me.
[time=1619] In the same way, also he took the cup after supper
[time=1635] saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[time=1638] Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[time=1648] [MUSIC - 269 seconds]
[time=1921] - It went an amazing morning and I want to just,
[time=1933] if you'd let me just share a few things with you today from Philippians two, would you open your Bibles to the book of Philippians?
[time=1939] And as you open your Bibles to the book of Philippians, we're studying this letter, looking at this week by week, kind of going passage by passage, making our way through stuff that is incredibly applicable.
[time=1951] We've already seen and learned that over the first few weeks.
[time=1954] And this morning, as you open to Philippians, I want to ask you a question.
[time=1957] So who's ultimately responsible for your spiritual growth?
[time=1961] What do you think about that with me this morning?
[time=1965] So who is it that is ultimately responsible for your spiritual growth?
[time=1973] If you're going to mature and develop in your walk and relationship with the Lord, who's mostly responsible for that?
[time=1982] Who has more to do with your spiritual progress?
[time=1988] You or God?
[time=1991] People answering already, I love it.
[time=1998] You know, people have debated this.
[time=2001] For years and years, people have debated and discussed this question for all the ages.
[time=2007] God's control over us or on the one side.
[time=2012] And then on the other, you've got man's ability to choose.
[time=2017] Now, there are those who on this question of who's ultimately responsible for your spiritual growth, there are those who tend to fall way over on the God is completely in charge side.
[time=2030] They would say that all spiritual growth or progress is only the work of God.
[time=2036] God grows us, the spirit of God grows us, spiritual development, they would say, comes only from Him, period, is that you?
[time=2045] That kind of where you would land if you were going to answer that question this morning who's ultimately responsible for your spiritual progress?
[time=2056] A lot of those folks would go to verses like the one we looked at just a couple of weeks ago when we started Philippians, Philippians 1-6.
[time=2063] Remember what it said?
[time=2064] Paul writing to the church at Philippi about their spiritual progress.
[time=2068] He said in verse six, chapter one, for I am confident of this very thing that he who's he, say it, God, that he who began a good work in you, he who started this spiritual work in you, he will complete it.
[time=2087] He will perfect it, it says there in verse six.
[time=2092] He will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.
[time=2096] Go, turn your Bibles to first Thessalonians.
[time=2101] Go back several books.
[time=2105] Go to first Thessalonians five.
[time=2107] First Thessalonians five, those who would really land over on the, it's only and always just God camp.
[time=2118] They might take you to first Thessalonians five, 23, where it says this, it says, now may the God of peace himself sanctify you entirely.
[time=2128] May the God of peace himself, may he sanctify you entirely, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2145] Faithful verse 24, faithful is he who calls you, and he also will bring it to pass, bring what to pass, the spirit, soul, and body being preserved complete without blame at the coming of our Lord.
[time=2162] Faithful is he, he will complete it.
[time=2169] I think about Zechariah 4-6.
[time=2171] Zechariah 4-6, many of you know it.
[time=2175] These words oftentimes kind of echo through my heart and mind.
[time=2179] Then he said to me, this is the word of the Lord to cerebral saying, not by what?
[time=2185] Say it, might, not by might, nor by what?
[time=2190] Power, the context here is talking about human might
[time=2196] and human power.
[time=2199] And here in Zechariah it says it's not gonna happen that way, not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit says the Lord of hosts.
[time=2211] On the other side of the discussion though, there are those who believe that man has been given choice and that spirit will growth and progress are completely a result of man's doing.
[time=2225] Is that you this morning?
[time=2228] Maybe that's where you feel like you would land on this and they read verses like Philippians.
[time=2233] Go back to our book that we're studying.
[time=2236] Go to Philippians three, listen to the language, listen to the lingo of Paul in Philippians three.
[time=2242] You see the same things in Romans.
[time=2244] We'll look at that in just a moment.
[time=2245] Look at Philippians 3-13.
[time=2247] Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet, spiritual maturity, progress.
[time=2255] You know, the end, but one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[time=2273] Look at Romans, Paul and his writings to the church at Rome.
[time=2278] Look at Romans six, I know we're kind of flipping around here, but stay with me, follow along and read from your Bible if you've got one this morning.
[time=2285] Look at Romans six, second part of verse 19.
[time=2290] Roman six, 19.
[time=2293] It says for just halfway down there, for just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, prior to faith in Christ, he says, remember how you presented your members as slaves to impurity, resulting in further lawlessness.
[time=2314] So now present your members, you present your members as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification.
[time=2323] Here you get sanctified when you present your members as slaves to righteousness.
[time=2330] Second Corinthians, go over just a couple of more books, first Corinthians, go to second Corinthians seven.
[time=2341] Second Corinthians seven, one.
[time=2343] Says therefore, Paul in his second letter to the church at Corinth, therefore having these promises, beloved Paul says, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
[time=2364] He says, you do this.
[time=2366] Let us together, cleanse ourselves and from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
[time=2376] So I ask you again, who's responsible for your spiritual growth?
[time=2383] Really, is it you or is it God?
[time=2387] I'm excited this morning.
[time=2389] And if you know me and if you know my personality, if you know my bent, you'll understand this because there are a lot of people in this world who really do enjoy living at, at both, you know, living at one of the other ends of the spectrum.
[time=2406] You know what I mean?
[time=2406] There are those who love living in the extremes.
[time=2409] I'm just not one of those.
[time=2411] I've always found myself feeling better about somewhere in the middle.
[time=2416] And I'm so thankful because as we come to our passage this morning in Philippians two, we come to the answer right here.
[time=2424] We come to the answer to this question in our ongoing study of Paul's letter.
[time=2429] Would you stand in honor of God's word and let me read this to you, Philippians chapter two verses 12 through 18.
[time=2440] Philippians chapter two verses 12 to 18, you'll hear the answer right here at the beginning.
[time=2447] But let me read the whole thing to you.
[time=2448] So then my beloved, just as you have always obeyed.
[time=2453] Not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence.
[time=2456] Work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[time=2461] For it is God who is at work in you,
[time=2467] both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
[time=2471] Do all things without grumbling or disputing so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you appear as lights in the world holding fast the word of life.
[time=2490] So that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain.
[time=2497] But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering, Paul was gonna meet his maker here soon.
[time=2504] It was all coming to an end.
[time=2506] Even if I'm poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all.
[time=2515] You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me.
[time=2524] Father in heaven, we pray this morning that you will just in these few moments give us some encouragement, give us some conviction, give us some reminder, God, give us new learning.
[time=2535] God allow us just to see in these words truth that will transform and change not only how we think but how we live in your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=2546] You can have a seat, I wrote some things out this week.
[time=2549] I entitled it a worked out, think barbells, think weights, think treadmills, think no donuts, a worked out salvation.
[time=2561] How does a salvation, three questions, how does a salvation get worked out?
[time=2566] How does a salvation get stronger?
[time=2568] How does a salvation, yours stay fit in its movement toward that which God has called you to?
[time=2577] Who does this?
[time=2580] Second question, which is the one we started with this morning.
[time=2582] Who's responsible for your spiritual life moving forward and getting stronger?
[time=2589] And thirdly, what does it look like?
[time=2591] When a faith, when a salvation, in this case yours in mine is getting worked out, what are some practical things that we'll see in your life that would be indicators that you are in fact having your faith worked out.
[time=2609] You go to the gym, I go to the gym.
[time=2613] We try to watch what we eat, we do a few push-ups, we do a few crunches, we get on an elliptical, we do whatever we do when you do that faithfully when it's really happening.
[time=2625] You see it, you know it, you feel it, it's obvious when we work out, there's progress.
[time=2635] What does this worked out faith look like?
[time=2640] He gives it to us right here in this passage.
[time=2642] We'll get as far as we can here and then we'll come back to it.
[time=2647] Number one, how does this salvation get worked out?
[time=2651] One word I want you to see here my friends, look at verse 12, so then with this whole discussion about you working out your faith or God working out your faith with that whole thing coming at the end of this verse, he starts the verse by saying this, so then my beloved, just as you have always, what?
[time=2677] Say that word again church, one more time, obeyed.
[time=2682] At the outset of this really amazing discussion,
[time=2689] he sets this principle right out in front and as he begins to talk about spiritual, as he begins to talk about salvation being worked out, strengthened, he puts it right there in front of us, this principle my friends of obedience, obedience.
[time=2709] As you have always obeyed, Paul urges them, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, obedience.
[time=2718] This one principle really is my friends at the foundation of your salvation getting worked out.
[time=2726] We've already mentioned it that when you work out you get stronger, so if you want your salvation to get stronger, if you want it to have more endurance, if you want to be able to persevere, if you want your salvation to be able to withstand the pressure and the trials and the challenges.
[time=2748] I want to remind you this morning, obey, obey him.
[time=2755] When you just think about a kid,
[time=2761] think about a little kid that you and I are working on, think about your kids, think about kids in a classroom, think about kids on a team, just think about little lives that we're trying to shape and mold and move down if they do what's right.
[time=2774] They get better and better at doing what's right, they get stronger.
[time=2781] Obedience breeds strength.
[time=2787] Obedience breeds progress.
[time=2790] Disobedience negates it.
[time=2793] Disobedient hinders it.
[time=2797] At the beginning of the discussion about spiritual growth and salvation getting worked out, we see the great enduring biblical principle of obedience.
[time=2808] I want you to think about obedience just for a moment with me, think, obedience requires a growing trust in God.
[time=2816] Think about this, how obedience, births, spiritual strength, how obedience helps a salvation get stronger.
[time=2828] Think about the things that get connected to obedience.
[time=2831] When you obey, think about what goes on.
[time=2833] First of all, obedience requires a growing trust in God.
[time=2838] You are not going to step out on that limb, are you?
[time=2844] You don't, I don't.
[time=2846] We don't step out on limbs that we don't trust.
[time=2850] As you're trusting Him, as your faith in Him is growing and developing, obedience is heightened.
[time=2857] Obedience requires a growing trust in God.
[time=2860] Think about this, obedience is fostered in community.
[time=2863] You and I don't obey alone.
[time=2866] You and I left to ourselves, don't do so well.
[time=2870] You and I just left to our best effort.
[time=2874] Usually not going to happen.
[time=2877] No, you and I, as it relates to obedience, that gets fostered when there's accountability in our lives.
[time=2884] You and I, obedience gets fostered when there are others that are living very close to you and me, seeing all the things that are really truly there, praying for us, encouraging us, speaking the truth and love toward us.
[time=2898] See, obedience requires a growing faith in God.
[time=2902] Obedience is fostered in community.
[time=2904] Obedience is motivated by the Word of God.
[time=2908] David said he hides God's Word in his heart so he will not disobey.
[time=2913] Obedience is motivated by the Scriptures when your life and your mind and your heart are surrounded by the Scriptures.
[time=2922] Obedience is more and more so up and to the right.
[time=2925] You remove God's Word from your life.
[time=2928] You remove the Scriptures from your daily routines.
[time=2930] You remove the power of the Word of God from your everyday experience and your everyday experience begins to look more and more detached from obedience.
[time=2944] Obedience is prompted by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2947] I just share these things with you to just show you in just kind of a composite picture.
[time=2956] How obedience births a strengthening of your faith in when the Holy Spirit is reigning and not the flesh when the Word of God is present when community is engaged, when a trust in God is increasing, obedience moves us toward great strength and great progress.
[time=2975] Joshua 5'6, just a reminder, we've read this before in days gone by for the sons of Israel.
[time=2982] Remember these guys, didn't go so well.
[time=2985] Walked 40 years in the wilderness until all the nation, that is the men of war who came out of Egypt perished because they did not what?
[time=2998] In a word, they didn't what?
[time=3001] Obey.
[time=3002] They did not listen to the voice of the Lord
[time=3008] and I would beg you this morning because I'm so very interested in your salvation getting stronger, I would beg you to listen to the voice of the Lord, young people, old people, anybody in between, obey God.
[time=3028] And it positions you for all that he has in store for you.
[time=3033] The promised land, your horse, the promises of God, obedience is your best bet.
[time=3041] It is the mechanism of salvation getting worked out.
[time=3045] Okay, who does this?
[time=3046] Second question, real quick, who?
[time=3050] We come to the question that we started with this morning.
[time=3054] Who's behind the spiritual movement in our lives?
[time=3058] You or God?
[time=3061] I love the answer, look at verse 12.
[time=3063] It says there, second part of verse 12, not as in my presence only, but now much more.
[time=3068] Am I absence?
[time=3069] And then he says, you, Philippians, you work out your salvation, couldn't get any clearer.
[time=3076] You work out your salvation with fear and trembling, it says.
[time=3084] That Greek verb to work out, to work out one's salvation.
[time=3089] It means this, listen, to continually toil to bring something to fulfillment or completion.
[time=3096] This isn't something he's saying he wants you to just kind of take a swipe at.
[time=3101] No, he is saying to you to the point of toil, to the point of physical exhaustion, you are to continually work to bring this, your salvation to fulfillment or completion.
[time=3115] It means you fulfilling your spiritual progress, your spiritual growth journey connected here in this passage directly to you.
[time=3126] And Paul says, at the end of that phrase, and you better do it with fear and trembling.
[time=3132] I'll tell you the same thing I told first hour.
[time=3134] I had a whole bunch of notes here, but I left them with this.
[time=3138] Why do you think it says that?
[time=3140] I left them with a question I didn't give an answer, I won't give you one either.
[time=3144] I'll leave it up to you.
[time=3148] To think about it, talk to some friends about it, look it up, give it some thought.
[time=3152] Why do you think it says?
[time=3156] That you are to work out your salvation.
[time=3159] We're not talking so much about that phrase, but with fear and trembling, that's the phrase I'm asking you about right here.
[time=3167] Why do you think God says that you and I are to work out our salvation and do it with an attitude with a mindset of fear and trembling?
[time=3178] It's a really interesting question.
[time=3181] I believe the answer is significant.
[time=3184] So everything in me wants to tell you what I think the answer is, but I'm gonna just let you wrestle with that, think that through, and give some thought to it.
[time=3193] So who's responsible?
[time=3194] Some of the room would say, well, clearly we are.
[time=3197] Well, but wait, 'cause then there's, because then there's 13.
[time=3201] 'Cause 12 says work out, I love the play on words here too.
[time=3204] 12 says work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[time=3209] For it is, here we go, verse 13, for it is God who is at what?
[time=3215] Say it, work.
[time=3218] So who's doing the work?
[time=3219] Or who?
[time=3221] Yeah.
[time=3223] For it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
[time=3232] You work it out, he says, because verse 13, because God is in you working it out.
[time=3242] See, it's not either or, it's what?
[time=3244] It's both and.
[time=3246] It is you and I on a regular basis, cooperating with God and his divine eternal work in you, and watch this, last thing, and then we'll go.
[time=3258] And it's not just some superficial, it's not just some superficial work he's doing.
[time=3264] He's not just patting you on the back.
[time=3268] The script, the text here gives us some great indication as to the depth and the level at which, if you're a child of God, he is at work in you because it says, for his God who is at work in you, both to what?
[time=3280] Both to will and to work.
[time=3284] That phrase to will that speaks to the deepest desires that you have.
[time=3291] The deepest part of you, that part of you where things go on that no one knows about, that part of you that is so ultimately and so intensely personal and private, that part of you that hardly anyone knows about, that part of you that has been wounded, that part of you that has been violated, that part of you that has been through so much, that part of you that today you know and I know causes so much confusion in you down deep
[time=3325] at the point of your will, your desires, he says, I am at work.
[time=3332] Both to will and to work for who's good pleasure.
[time=3339] There's a question.
[time=3342] Yeah, see, be careful, my friends, because sometimes we'll come back to this, but sometimes when you and I start thinking about our salvation and what it looks like and where it's going, we just wanna make sure it's what we want.
[time=3355] We just wanna make sure that it ends up the way we want it.
[time=3360] We just wanna make sure it goes the way we'd like it to go and I just want you to understand that God is at work in you.
[time=3368] God is at work in the deepest parts of you and he is going to finish what he started, one six, and it's going to be for his good pleasure, not who's.
[time=3385] Doesn't mean that we can't be on the same page with him.
[time=3388] What it means is hang on, hang on to him.
[time=3394] Be faithful, go where he goes.
[time=3398] I wrote this out, I'll leave you with this this morning.
[time=3402] Here's a prayer I challenged first hour to be willing to pray, God I'm begging you, do whatever you need to do with me as you work out my salvation in order for you to be what?
[time=3414] Please, let's stand.
[time=3417] Father in heaven, we're grateful this morning how great a salvation the author said, and it is a great salvation.
[time=3427] Oh, we've been reminded of that this morning through the Lord's table, through baptism, through fellowship, worship, and now even your word, how great a salvation.
[time=3437] Oh God, we commit to you again to do our best to follow you as you work in us and as we cooperate with you and work as diligently and as faithfully and as hard as we can, toiling to bring it to fulfillment.
[time=3453] God, a fulfillment made possible only by your work in us.
[time=3458] So God, please keep growing us.
[time=3462] I pray that as we come to the preparation tonight, maybe as families or as small groups or even as individuals, as we read and as we choose what we will fast and as we begin to think through our alms offerings, oh God, may you prepare not only our hearts individually, but God, I pray this morning that you would prepare the heart of this church as we look forward to the resurrection.
[time=3486] Oh God, do a great thing we pray in your son's name and everybody agreed and said amen.
[time=3491] (upbeat music)
