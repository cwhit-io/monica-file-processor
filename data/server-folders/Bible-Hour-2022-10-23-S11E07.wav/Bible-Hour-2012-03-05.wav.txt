[time=126] (audience applauding)
[time=132] - Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=135] My name's Kelly Bird and I'm the senior pastor here at Black Hawk and part of an amazing team, a team that is really thankful for you, each and every one of you.
[time=144] We're grateful you're part of the Bible Hour audience and as always, we wanna make available to you everything that we make available to those that are here on a regular basis and here is an opportunity coming up in March that I don't want you to miss.
[time=158] It's called the Art of Marriage.
[time=161] Most of you may remember in January, we went through a five week teaching series called We Are Family and as part of that, we talked specifically about God's design for marriage, God's design for husbands and wives.
[time=173] And this is an opportunity for anybody in the marriage arena.
[time=178] Maybe you're thinking about getting married.
[time=180] Maybe you've been married for a few years.
[time=181] Maybe you've been married for a lot of years and you could really benefit from some reminders, some encouragement, some practical help.
[time=189] March 16 and 17, you see the dates right here on the bottom of the screen.
[time=194] The Art of Marriage, Friday evening, most of the day, Saturday and you are gonna get encouraged, you're gonna get helped, you're gonna be given practical biblical principles to help your marriage be all that God designed it to be.
[time=207] I want you to go to our website at blackcockministries.org, click on the Art of Marriage and learn all that you can.
[time=213] If we can help, call us here at the church office.
[time=216] We'd love to point you in the right direction, but it's something that I really want you to be a part of.
[time=220] I don't want you to miss.
[time=222] So make plans now to join us in March for the Art of Marriage.
[time=226] Hey, I'm glad you tuned in today.
[time=227] Really thankful that you're gonna get to hear this morning's message.
[time=230] I hope it's an encouragement to you, wherever you are in your spiritual journey.
[time=234] And I hope in the days to come, you'll come and visit us on a Sunday morning at nine or 1045.
[time=240] We'd love to meet you.
[time=241] Yeah, God bless you.
[time=242] Have a great week.
[time=243] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=245] - Doug?
[time=250] - Glenn?
[time=252] Hey, how are ya?
[time=254] - I'm good, I'm good, and you?
[time=255] I mean, what are you doing now?
[time=256] - I'm in marketing.
[time=258] - Now here, there's a little one now.
[time=259] - Yeah.
[time=260] - How's fatherhood treating you?
[time=262] - Really well, really well.
[time=263] - Sleepless nights?
[time=264] - Yeah, yeah, but it's totally worth it though.
[time=267] Oh, is that the time?
[time=268] I gotta run, I'm gonna be late to a meeting, but it was good to see you again, and we should catch up sometime, over coffee.
[time=273] Yeah, I'll call you, soon.
[time=275] - That phrase sounds really familiar, doesn't it?
[time=279] I'll call ya, we'll have coffee sometime, soon.
[time=283] We've all said it, I've said it.
[time=285] But I haven't always meant it.
[time=289] I've also taken phone calls that we're never really there.
[time=293] You know, I think there's an app for that.
[time=295] But on the other hand, some of us have said it, and although we really meant it, we just never followed through.
[time=303] It's easy to get caught up in the everyday chores of life.
[time=306] Going to meetings, doing laundry, taking kids to practice, and then what little time we do have left seems to get swallowed up in going to the games, checking our email, or updating our Facebook status.
[time=319] Sometimes it's tough to find an hour, half an hour, 15 minutes even, to just sit down and catch up with an old friend.
[time=326] Sometimes it takes a little bit of sacrifice.
[time=329] But when you finally sit down for the first time in months with that cup of coffee with a friend, well, there's nothing like it.
[time=340] You talk, you laugh, you share, you just love each other.
[time=345] You see, I think that's what people don't realize is that coffee equals love.
[time=350] Coffee is quality time.
[time=355] When you set that time aside for a friend, it's like you're giving them a gift, especially when time is so precious in the world we live in today when there's so little of it to go around.
[time=365] It's a sacrifice, but it goes both ways.
[time=369] If we don't put time into our relationships, they begin to fall apart.
[time=377] Let me ask you this.
[time=379] When was the last time you invested in your most important relationship?
[time=383] When was the last time you had coffee with God?
[time=386] When was the last time you just, you sat down and you shared with God?
[time=390] Or have you been blowing him off, taking phone calls that didn't really matter, making excuses, oh, I just don't have the time.
[time=399] Because you see, it's just the same as having coffee with anybody else.
[time=403] I mean, it takes a little work, a little bit of scheduling, you've got to shuffle things around so that you can devote some time to the one who gave you eternity.
[time=411] And when you finally do sit down, there's just nothing like that in that friendship and that relationship that you have.
[time=419] And you know what?
[time=420] It might be that you have to get up a little bit earlier.
[time=423] You might have to take a quicker shower or maybe spend your break not on Facebook.
[time=428] But that's just it.
[time=430] That's what makes it a sacrifice.
[time=432] That's what makes that time a gift and actually worship to God.
[time=436] Now, I know what some of you may be thinking.
[time=440] 10 extra minutes in an ice warm cozy bed in the morning, next to your spouse is a good thing.
[time=445] And I totally agree.
[time=446] But what if you didn't talk to your spouse every day?
[time=452] What if you stopped spending times with your loved ones?
[time=454] What would happen then?
[time=456] Because essentially, that's what we do to God.
[time=458] We put him on a shelf.
[time=459] Or we take an imaginary phone call.
[time=462] We get distracted and we miss out on the most precious communication we could have all day.
[time=467] Time with our father.
[time=468] Time for coffee with a friend.
[time=474] (gentle music)
[time=486] [MUSIC - 126 seconds]
[time=615] - Abide in me and I am you.
[time=621] As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me.
[time=630] I am the vine, you are the branches.
[time=633] Whoever abides in me and I in him, he is that bears much fruit.
[time=638] For apart from me, you could do nothing.
[time=640] - Oh God, you are my God.
[time=645] Earnestly I seek you.
[time=647] My soul thirsts for you.
[time=649] My flesh faints for you as in a dry and weary land, where there is no water.
[time=654] My soul will be satisfied as with rich food.
[time=658] And my mouth will praise you with joyful lips.
[time=661] My soul clings to you, for your righteous right upholds me.
[time=666] [MUSIC - 66 seconds]
[time=737] - Hey, open your Bibles if you would to the book of Philippians.
[time=744] In the New Testament, we just recently have started a new study.
[time=748] Paul's a letter to the church at Philippi.
[time=750] We've been making our way through the first couple of chapters.
[time=753] And we come today to chapter two.
[time=757] We're gonna go back to basically where we were last week.
[time=760] We didn't quite get to finish.
[time=761] And so I wanna review just a little bit and then pick up where we left off.
[time=766] Philippians chapter two, verse 12 is where we started last week.
[time=770] And here's the theme that we introduced last week.
[time=773] The theme that we introduced last week was growing or working out weights and dumbbells and elliptical machines strengthening our salvation.
[time=786] This was the theme that we introduced.
[time=790] Working out our salvation.
[time=794] I wanna say this to you as we start.
[time=796] I've been privileged, really blessed.
[time=800] To be able to continue to experience and enjoy the friendship that God has given me with a good friend of mine, a friend of many of yours, his name's Austin.
[time=812] Austin Hatch.
[time=813] Most of you know that last June, Stephen Kim were killed tragically in a plane crash.
[time=817] Austin at the age of 16 was in the back seat of that plane.
[time=821] Miraculously, Austin wasn't killed, though he did suffer severe physical trauma injuries, especially to his brain.
[time=831] And it has been an amazing thing to see over these months how he has continued to progress, how he has continued to heal, how he has continued to gain strength mentally and physically doing things way above and beyond what anybody ever thought he was gonna be able to do.
[time=849] I have the privilege of being with him on a weekly basis.
[time=851] Sometimes a couple of times a week and to talk with him and to be with him is an absolute joy.
[time=856] We have no idea where that's gonna go, but we know today we're thankful.
[time=861] It has gone places, again, folks never dreamed it would.
[time=864] And here's what I wanna tell you this morning.
[time=865] As I talk with doctors, as I've talked with over the months with neurologists, as I've talked with the team that has treated Austin, one thing that I've heard them consistently say is this, as it relates to the progress that he's making today physically, a lot of it has to do with how strong he was,
[time=887] his physical condition at the point at which the physical trauma enters in.
[time=895] At the point at which he meets physical crisis, there was a physical strength and he was strong.
[time=903] He's just a moose.
[time=904] He's a big kid, six, six, two, 12.
[time=907] I mean, he had been working out for a couple of years at a level that most never dream of.
[time=911] And there was a physical strength that when met up against, (coughing) sorry, that when that physical strength met up against physical trauma, it allowed him to face that in a way that had he been physically weak, it never, ever would have worked.
[time=935] And where he's gone today and where he may go in the days to come, a lot of that has to do with the physical strength that he possessed at the time of the accident.
[time=948] Now friends, I want you to follow me here this morning that is exactly what we're talking about when we talk about the importance of your spiritual strength.
[time=959] Your spiritual muscle, your spiritual,
[time=965] you fine tuning your spiritual frame, the point at which spiritual conflict comes in, the degree to which you're able to handle that, the degree to which you're able to move through that, completely contingent upon your spiritual strength.
[time=984] And so we asked three questions last week as we came to Philippians 2, 12.
[time=989] How does, number one, we asked, how does a salvation get worked out?
[time=995] How do we move toward muscular, finely tuned faith?
[time=1001] And we answered that question for you last week in one word, and if you weren't here last week, I hope you'll write it down because that one word is found right there in two, 12.
[time=1009] So then my beloved, just as you have always, what?
[time=1012] Say it, obeyed.
[time=1014] So then my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more even in my absence.
[time=1023] Obaying God, write it down.
[time=1025] Obaying God strengthens our faith.
[time=1028] What a treadmill weights and nutrition bring to strengthening our physical frames, obeying God brings to strengthening our spiritual hearts.
[time=1039] What a treadmill weights and nutrition bring to strengthening our physical frames, obeying God.
[time=1048] Obaying God brings to strengthening our spiritual hearts.
[time=1054] God knew this.
[time=1056] God knew this in 1 Samuel 15, 22.
[time=1058] Some of you know this, others of you don't, but look at the screen, write this one down.
[time=1062] God said, has the Lord as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord answer?
[time=1072] Behold, to obey is what?
[time=1074] Say it, better.
[time=1076] To obey is better than sacrifice.
[time=1079] And to heed, to do what you're told, to heed better than the fat of rams.
[time=1088] Better than the fat of rams.
[time=1089] If it all boils down to one thing, this is what this verse is saying, if it all kind of boils down to one thing, I don't want your words, I don't want your gifts, I don't want your repetition, I want your what?
[time=1101] Your obedience, because it is foundationally, it is your obedience to God that grows and strengthens your faith.
[time=1112] The second question we asked last week was who actually does the work of our salvation getting strengthened?
[time=1120] Is it God or is it man?
[time=1123] Who actually does the work of strengthening and building our salvation?
[time=1129] Well, we asked that question and we allowed the scriptures to answer the question for us, but now much more, end of 12, but now much more in my absence, Paul says to the Philippians, you, you work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[time=1146] For it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
[time=1154] We learned last week that God works in our deepest parts.
[time=1159] To finish what he started, Philippians one six said that he, God, who began a good work in you, God was the one who saved you, God was the one who drew you to himself.
[time=1171] God is the one it says in one six that will complete that work.
[time=1174] It's all God, Philippians one six.
[time=1177] We learned that God works in our deepest parts to finish what he started and we learned that man cooperates in fear and trembling with God as we work out our faith.
[time=1195] If you stay with the physical analogy, it all makes sense.
[time=1198] We have to put on our shoes.
[time=1200] We have to go join by a membership.
[time=1202] We have to put in the hour every day.
[time=1205] You don't get physically strong thinking about it.
[time=1208] You go and do it.
[time=1211] You roll up your sleeves and you give yourself to the part that you play spiritually same thing.
[time=1216] You have to choose every day to obey.
[time=1219] A choice made possible only by the power of God, the Holy Spirit that resides in your very soul.
[time=1225] So last week we had your salvation getting worked out and if we take the first two questions from the message and we bring them together, it's really very simple but very profound.
[time=1239] You, you need to obey God.
[time=1244] You in cooperation with God who is at work
[time=1250] and you have to submit your will as he works, both to will and to work for his good pleasure as he grows you, obedience being the key.
[time=1260] So just think about it practically.
[time=1263] Just practically for a moment.
[time=1265] When out of obedience to God, you respect and honor your husband, wives.
[time=1270] Spiritual muscles get developed.
[time=1277] When out of obedience to God, you love and honor your wife, husbands, when you live with her in an understanding way, your faith gets worked out.
[time=1287] Just think of it practically.
[time=1291] When out of obedience to God, you stop having sex outside of or before marriage.
[time=1297] Spiritual muscles get built when you make that decision and you discipline yourself and put yourself in positions where you can honor God and not disobey him spiritually, you get stronger.
[time=1312] When out of obedience to God, you stop disobeying and deceiving your parents.
[time=1319] Some of you in the room are doing that.
[time=1323] Young ones, younger and younger as the days go by, engaged in deceptive activity.
[time=1332] And when you do that, you get weaker, not stronger, and when you stop disobeying and deceiving your parents out of obedience to God, your spiritual muscles develop.
[time=1347] When you discontinue out of obedience to God, when you discontinue making room in your day-to-day life for temptation and sin, your faith gets worked out.
[time=1357] When out of obedience to God, you start choosing to trust God's timing with those you love and stop trying to control them with your anger or your manipulation.
[time=1370] Spiritual muscles get bigger.
[time=1372] You know the how I need to obey list is long.
[time=1376] I know.
[time=1377] All of it, you and I need to give ourselves to and none of it will ever happen without God's intrusive faithful work.
[time=1387] It's both God and man, amen?
[time=1391] Then we got to question three.
[time=1393] This is where we left off last week.
[time=1394] Question three, what does a getting worked out faith look like?
[time=1399] And what will it actually be like for me or for you when our faith is getting worked out, spiritually developed, finely tuned?
[time=1407] And this is when we came to verses 14 through 16.
[time=1410] So would you let me read this to you this morning?
[time=1412] This is what it looks like.
[time=1414] Here is a faith that's getting worked out.
[time=1417] Do all things without grumbling or complaining so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you appear as lights in the world holding fast the word of life.
[time=1442] This is where we kind of ran out of time last week and I want you to look at what it says there.
[time=1448] Did you hear what I read?
[time=1449] We are, with our worked out faith, we are to appear as lights.
[time=1458] People, the text clearly implies,
[time=1466] that people are watching you.
[time=1469] There is, according to this passage,
[time=1475] there is an assessment going on.
[time=1479] As you and I live out our faith one way or the other, people are forming an opinion.
[time=1486] And it's not just about you.
[time=1488] It's about who?
[time=1490] It's about God.
[time=1491] We are to appear as lights.
[time=1495] People are watching.
[time=1496] There is an assessment going on.
[time=1499] I wonder what they're thinking.
[time=1500] You know, there was a day on the topic of what people think of you.
[time=1505] Let's just talk about that for a second.
[time=1508] There was a day, there were many days in my own life, or that was just a killer for me.
[time=1515] There was a day when I just cared way to, I cared desperately about what people thought of me, how people viewed me.
[time=1525] You know, leaders make decisions, pastors lead churches in certain directions.
[time=1529] There are hard calls that get made, leadership choices that people inevitably have feelings about.
[time=1535] And oftentimes they'll let you know about their feelings regarding your decisions.
[time=1541] And it used to tear me up.
[time=1544] I couldn't stand it.
[time=1545] I couldn't bear the thought of any single person not being happy with me.
[time=1551] It would paralyze me, discourage me, and it began to create in me this effort to preach and lead and shepherd a church in a way that would somehow keep all parties happy.
[time=1562] How'd that go?
[time=1566] It didn't go very well.
[time=1568] Not for you or for me.
[time=1570] So thankfully, so grateful.
[time=1573] I learned a very valuable lesson, that lesson being that while I should love you and serve you and feed you as best I can God's word and lead you with courage and faithfulness, trying to please people as I execute my ministry is a losing proposition.
[time=1594] Anybody disagree?
[time=1596] No, we're all on the same page.
[time=1598] As it relates to pastoring and leading in the church, I learned to primarily please God and our elders and to not lose too much sleep over everyone liking me.
[time=1608] I tell my kids the same thing.
[time=1610] As my kids get older, they bump into it all the time.
[time=1612] Your kids do too, I tell them, look, I know what it's like and you just gotta be you.
[time=1617] Yeah, they're gonna want you to listen to certain stuff.
[time=1620] They're gonna wanna have you go certain places.
[time=1623] They're gonna want you to talk a certain way.
[time=1625] I mean, it's just how peer pressure works.
[time=1627] It's how our culture is and I just keep telling them you can't care about what they think.
[time=1632] You just gotta be you and you gotta do it the way you know in your heart you wanna do it.
[time=1637] So that's the message, critical people in the church.
[time=1642] I know there's not a whole lot I can do.
[time=1645] What people think of us, how others view us for the most part, my advice is don't worry about it.
[time=1650] Just be you.
[time=1651] I believe that, don't worry about what people think.
[time=1653] Unless, here's my caveat, unless what they think of you
[time=1660] is connected to your witness to them.
[time=1670] If what we're talking about here is your character,
[time=1676] if what we're talking about here is your personal integrity, if what we're talking about is your willingness to live out your faith, then it's a different story.
[time=1688] Trying to please critical people's not gonna work, but when the context of this conversation shifts to your spiritual influence of others, your faithfulness to God in the way you live out and model his commands to an on looking world that sees the way you choose, that sees the stuff you value and the principles that you really do follow.
[time=1712] If that's what we're talking about, then I would say to you, oh, please, care.
[time=1718] Care very, very much what they think.
[time=1722] Care about what they see.
[time=1725] Care about what they're saying.
[time=1727] Loose sleep over how they view you.
[time=1731] Because God's word says to you right here in Philippians two, it says so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent.
[time=1739] Children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you appear as lights in the world.
[time=1748] There are people, listen church, there are people trapped in darkness and they are watching you.
[time=1756] And not only should you care, you should live in a way that makes a difference.
[time=1761] So here you go, three ways to light up your dark world for God.
[time=1765] This is what a worked out faith looks like.
[time=1769] Three ways to light up your dark world for God.
[time=1773] And before we jump in here to number one, I wanna say this to you, please don't miss this.
[time=1778] I wanna show you what it says here.
[time=1785] It says so that you will prove yourself to be blameless and innocent.
[time=1788] Children of God above reproach in the midst of, you see that 15?
[time=1798] In the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.
[time=1803] Here's what I wanna say before we start.
[time=1805] And I say it because I get worried sometimes for us.
[time=1809] The scripture here assumes that you live your life
[time=1817] in such a way that you are in proximity.
[time=1821] Please understand the word midst.
[time=1825] In the midst of doesn't mean on the peripheral of.
[time=1830] In the midst of doesn't mean on the parameter.
[time=1834] In the midst of means smack dab in the what?
[time=1839] In the middle.
[time=1841] So scripture here assumes that somehow
[time=1847] you and me have figured out ways, even though we're saved, even though we love church, even though we have small group, all of which are important, even though we're engaged in ministry, even though we love being with believers who encourage us in our faith, it assumes you live in the midst of a perverse and crooked generation.
[time=1871] The Bible assumes proximity.
[time=1875] And if you're not in proximity, you're not gonna light any thing or anybody up.
[time=1882] So I just give that to you.
[time=1887] To think about where you live.
[time=1890] I know some of you, your workplace problem solved.
[time=1894] I know some of you, where you live in your neighborhood, boom, plenty of opportunity.
[time=1898] Some of you in your own family, great.
[time=1901] But some of you, some of you need to think about this.
[time=1904] Where have you positioned yourself?
[time=1906] How do you live life?
[time=1909] What kind of opportunity are you giving yourself to light up a dark world for God?
[time=1913] Number one, don't grumble.
[time=1915] Don't grumble or question.
[time=1917] Three ways to light up your dark world for God from Philippians chapter two.
[time=1921] Do all things without grumbling or disputing.
[time=1926] The word grumble in the Greek means to complain.
[time=1928] When you look up the Greek word for grumble, which means to complain, it's interesting.
[time=1932] It tells you that not only is this what it means, it's an interesting thing.
[time=1936] It tells you what it sounds like.
[time=1938] Literally in my Greek stuff that I look it up and it says that you're supposed to not only define it, but what they say when you define it, make sure that you sound like it because there's a sound that was connected to that word and you all know what the sound is.
[time=1956] It's grumbling.
[time=1958] And it says I was supposed to say it this way.
[time=1960] So I will, it's grumbling.
[time=1962] It's an emotional rejection of God's providence and commands.
[time=1967] It basically fundamentally says, write this down.
[time=1972] I don't wanna, everybody say it.
[time=1977] I don't wanna, I don't wanna have a good attitude
[time=1983] in the midst of my pain.
[time=1987] I don't wanna admit I'm wrong.
[time=1989] I don't wanna say I'm sorry.
[time=1991] I don't wanna be patient when wronged.
[time=1993] I don't wanna get up early to be with God.
[time=1996] I don't wanna keep working hard at my job.
[time=1999] My job stinks.
[time=2000] I was pretending there.
[time=2003] (audience laughs) I love my job.
[time=2005] I wanna be nice to the jerk at school.
[time=2009] Grumbling, complaining.
[time=2014] Not good.
[time=2016] Not good and not just not good, but understand why it's not good.
[time=2021] This is exactly what the dark world does that you're supposed to be lighting up.
[time=2027] So don't do what they do.
[time=2028] And why do they grumble?
[time=2030] Why do they question?
[time=2032] Because they're on their own.
[time=2034] Because they're alone.
[time=2037] Because they have no hope.
[time=2040] They have no trust.
[time=2041] They have no good God to hold on to.
[time=2044] They've got nothing.
[time=2045] You, you have a God who saved you, who is at work in you.
[time=2051] Both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
[time=2054] You have a God who began something.
[time=2056] He's gonna complete and you know it or you should.
[time=2059] So don't grumble.
[time=2062] Don't emotionally reject the providence and commands of God.
[time=2067] No, you know him and you know he's good and you know his providence and his commands are right.
[time=2072] So it's not I don't wanna, it's I will.
[time=2076] I will what?
[time=2078] I will obey and I will be who God has called me to be.
[time=2082] I will not grumble or question.
[time=2085] Secondly, don't give anyone.
[time=2090] Write it down.
[time=2091] Don't give anyone the opportunity to point a finger.
[time=2095] You wanna know what a worked out faith looks like.
[time=2098] You wanna know what a faith that lights up their dark world is characterized by.
[time=2103] They are above.
[time=2104] This is a faith.
[time=2105] This is a person, a man or a woman, a student, a boy or a girl who is above reproach.
[time=2113] So that you will prove verse 15, that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent.
[time=2118] Children of God above reproach.
[time=2123] That word, that phrase above reproach in the original language.
[time=2128] That's why I used the phrase to point a finger.
[time=2132] It means beyond accusation.
[time=2135] I want you to think about that.
[time=2136] It means beyond accusation.
[time=2139] Nobody can really point a finger at you and accuse you of something immoral.
[time=2146] Accuse you of bad character.
[time=2148] Accuse you of a lack of integrity.
[time=2151] As a pattern in your life, you are one who has given yourself to obedience at such a level for such a period of time that truly you come to a place not of perfection, but of character.
[time=2166] And that when people might try to say something about you, here's how it got defined for me.
[time=2172] Years ago, I learned it this way.
[time=2173] It is to live at such a level of personal integrity that anyone who knows you, like really knows you and you know and I know, there's people who really, really know us, that anyone who knows you would laugh if someone came to them and said you were doing this.
[time=2194] They would say, no way.
[time=2198] You are so, you are so wrong.
[time=2202] You don't know him.
[time=2202] I know him.
[time=2204] And that's not him.
[time=2206] That's not her.
[time=2207] You got your story wrong.
[time=2208] That's above reproach.
[time=2212] And God's Word says to you and to me this morning that if you and I are engaged in a faith that is getting worked out, we will be people.
[time=2220] What did it say there?
[time=2221] I want you to read these two words, blameless and innocent.
[time=2228] Do you see it?
[time=2229] Underline those.
[time=2231] Blameless and innocent.
[time=2234] You know what those two words mean?
[time=2236] Those two words mean blameless without blame.
[time=2242] And not guilty.
[time=2244] Now I understand, please hear me.
[time=2245] I am not preaching nor is this passage promoting some doctrine of perfection.
[time=2250] This is talking about the pattern, the growing pattern of your life.
[time=2255] And I bring these two words to your attention because today my friends in the church, we really have come to a place where more and more so as the years have gone by, we've watered down words like this.
[time=2267] And we've watered down concepts like this.
[time=2270] So many times you and I have heard, well, no one can be that.
[time=2274] You can't really be blameless.
[time=2278] You can't really be innocent.
[time=2279] So we almost set these principles aside.
[time=2284] And I just want to invite you this morning to not set this aside.
[time=2288] Because it really is indicative of a faith that is getting worked out, that you would strive, that it really would be your goal, that there would be a heart in you that would want to live in a way at home, that would want to live in a way at work, that would want to live in a way privately in your world that would be blameless, that would be characterized by obedience, not disobedience, where you and I fall, we're grateful for God's grace and mercy, the forgiveness that he brings.
[time=2319] But I want to be a part of a people who see things like this and say, that's who I want to be.
[time=2324] I don't want to be the exception.
[time=2326] I want to be that.
[time=2327] I want to move in this direction.
[time=2329] Strong, healthy.
[time=2331] Don't give anyone the opportunity to point a finger.
[time=2334] And let me mention it to you one more time.
[time=2336] This occurs when over time you faithfully say, yes, instead of I don't want to, remove the I don't want to obey day in and day out,
[time=2351] week after week, month after month, there's an integrity that will grow, that will bring you to a place of living above reproach.
[time=2360] Thirdly, don't let go of the gospel.
[time=2362] You want to light up your dark world for God?
[time=2367] You want to have a faith that's strong and muscular and finely tuned, don't let go of the gospel.
[time=2376] Look at verse 16, it says right there at the beginning, it says at the end of 15, it says, among whom you appear as lights in the world, holding fast the word of life.
[time=2391] You say, words, you get the gospel.
[time=2393] Well, let me just make sure you understand this, the word.
[time=2395] You see the word, you and I see that phrase, the word, and we think of the scriptures, that's good, we should, that's usually what that means.
[time=2402] When you see this phrase, the word of life, this is a unique phrase that has to do with the word specifically the truth of, listen, the life giving eternity altering truth of the gospel, the word of life.
[time=2422] See, you've been given, if you know him, you've been given the word of life, you have not only experienced the gospel.
[time=2432] I say gospel, I want to make sure we all know what that means.
[time=2436] The gospel, that man in his sinfulness is left to himself separated from God.
[time=2444] No if, ands, or buts.
[time=2446] That God, in his great love for God so loved the world
[time=2453] that he gave his only son.
[time=2456] That God gave his son, Jesus Christ, to come, to live die, experience death on your behalf in mind, cancel the debt of sin, he defeats death, comes out of the tomb like we will, and in that gives us the hope of eternal life, the gospel.
[time=2475] See, you've been given this, and he says to you with a growing and strong faith, you're not gonna grumble, you're not gonna question, you're gonna live lives above reproach and you are not going to let go, you are going to hold fast this gospel.
[time=2495] Now listen, I hope you'll write this down.
[time=2498] It took me like 20 minutes.
[time=2500] I scribbled, you know me in my scrim, I scribbled forever on this one, and they finally came up with this.
[time=2505] It should be your consuming thought.
[time=2508] It should be the gospel and your role, your opportunity to share it.
[time=2516] It should be your consuming thought and regular, if not constant message.
[time=2532] We ought to be impacted, struck daily by the desperate need people have for the good news, and we should be lovingly, carefully, but intentionally saying something.
[time=2545] I know there was a day when maybe the church got to a point where you think or I think the church was saying too much.
[time=2552] Well, guess what, we're certainly not in that day anymore.
[time=2555] Too many of us have gotten way too quiet with the gospel and there are opportunities, legitimate ones.
[time=2563] I'm not talking about obnoxious ones, I'm talking about legitimate chances for you and I to say something, to offer an invitation, to go to coffee, to, in fact we're gonna do a drama next week.
[time=2577] That was a great drama by the way.
[time=2578] I think next we're gonna do a guy's drama and with all the guys sitting watching a game, 'cause games equal love, right guys, amen?
[time=2585] No, but we can say something.
[time=2589] You can say something.
[time=2591] You can engage in conversation with our heart to hopefully have God use that to, but we don't, too many times we're way too quiet.
[time=2600] You know what, too many times I'm too quiet.
[time=2603] You say, wait a minute, you're you, you gotta be thinking this all the time, I don't.
[time=2606] I'm sorry, I don't, I should,
[time=2612] but I don't, I've been asking God, I ask God Monday.
[time=2616] I started on this last Wednesday and I ask God Monday, oh God, please help me go into situations differently.
[time=2624] Help me walk into conversations differently.
[time=2626] God, give me some antenna or something to help me be impacted by what I'm seeing and the opportunity it represents for the gospel.
[time=2635] So I get a call late last week, I think,
[time=2642] and I get the privilege of getting to be with a family one night this week in the midst of a crisis, in the midst of death and hurt and pain and just dear people who were really hurting and there was a lot going on that night, but I was so thankful to get to be there with them and a whole lot of other folks came and it was such a great idea.
[time=2666] The daughters decided that they wanted to open up the room for people to say things about this individual who had passed away was their dad.
[time=2677] Well, so here's the deal and this happens more than you'd realize, it shocks me still that this happens, but I didn't know this guy, but guess what this guy in the last few years of his life, guess what he watched on Sunday mornings?
[time=2692] He watched the Bible hour.
[time=2696] His daughters find notes tucked away in his Bible with my name on it and notes from messages and friends and family begin to talk about the change that had transpired in this guy's life in the last couple of years, drastic change.
[time=2714] And so as the people in the room are talking about this change, I start to realize that many of the people, if not all, who are talking about the change are talking about it in glowing terms, but each of them in their own way kind of said, "But we didn't understand it." And it hits me, they need the gospel.
[time=2741] And so I just kind of changed my mind right there and instead of going to the next thing, I just gave the gospel because this had been on my heart and on my mind.
[time=2754] It ought to be my consuming thought and if not my constant message, it should be pretty regular.
[time=2762] And I hope that makes sense to you.
[time=2765] And I'm not lifting myself up in that illustration, really I'm saying I should have done that a whole lot more times than I have.
[time=2771] But I hope it sinks in.
[time=2775] We ought to be impacted and struck daily by the desperate need people have.
[time=2779] Now, let me say this and we're gonna go.
[time=2781] Here's a really important, this is very important, theological, historical truth and light of everything I just said.
[time=2789] Listen, this divine strategy of God to reach people who need Him by using the light and reputation of the people who know Him doesn't find its beginnings here in Philippians two.
[time=2804] No, it doesn't find its beginnings in the New Testament, it doesn't find its beginnings in the gospels.
[time=2809] No, this idea that God's people would live their daily lives in such a way as to attract or draw people who are far from God closer to God starts back at the very beginning in the early pages of our first Testament, otherwise known as the what?
[time=2828] The Old Testament, look at Exodus, chapter nine, everybody please turn real quick.
[time=2833] Exodus 19, I want you to see God's design how from the very beginning it was His heart that His people, you, me, Israel would reach others through the way we lived, through the light and reputation, the blamelessness of our lives, Exodus 19.4, He says, "You yourselves have seen what I did "to the Egyptians and how I bore you on Eagle's wings "and brought you to myself." Stop right there, that's salvation.
[time=2867] You and I were born on Eagle's wings and God brought us away from our Egypt to a place of salvation.
[time=2875] That's what He's saying there.
[time=2877] Now, now then if you will indeed, there it is, there's that word, everybody say it.
[time=2884] Obey, now if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is whose?
[time=2897] Mine, and you shall be to me a kingdom of what?
[time=2902] Say it, priests, we've taught you about priests over the years.
[time=2906] Priests are those who are gods and they represent God.
[time=2909] Priests pass along the attributes of God to an on-looking, needy world.
[time=2916] It's all right here.
[time=2917] A kingdom of priests and a holy nation.
[time=2920] Different, distinct, unique, not common, but uncommon.
[time=2926] Set apart for work, the work of the kingdom.
[time=2931] Go to Isaiah, please turn to the middle of your Bible, right?
[time=2937] Go pass Psalms, go to Isaiah 42.
[time=2939] Would you please turn there?
[time=2941] I want you to read this with me.
[time=2943] I know some of you may not have Bibles and so it is on the screen, but if you can, turn and read with me.
[time=2948] Isaiah 42, six and seven.
[time=2950] Isaiah 42, six and seven, I am the Lord.
[time=2955] You see that?
[time=2957] I am the Lord.
[time=2958] I have called you in righteousness.
[time=2961] I will also hold you by the hand and watch over you.
[time=2965] And I will appoint you as a covenant to the people.
[time=2969] As a what?
[time=2970] Say it, church, as a light to the nations.
[time=2974] This is great.
[time=2974] To open blind eyes.
[time=2978] This is what he has called you to do.
[time=2980] You, in cooperation with him.
[time=2985] Opening blind eyes.
[time=2989] To bring out prisoners from the dungeon and those who dwell in darkness, in sin, from the prison.
[time=2996] Look at 49.
[time=2998] Go to 49, six.
[time=3000] Isaiah 49, six, he says, is it too small a thing?
[time=3005] That you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved ones of Israel.
[time=3012] I will also make you a what?
[time=3014] Say it, church, light, a light of the nations so that my salvation may reach to where?
[time=3023] To the end of the earth.
[time=3025] You and I, called by God.
[time=3027] Original design to be his people.
[time=3030] And represent him in this way, 60.
[time=3034] Go to Isaiah 60, a few pages over.
[time=3036] Isaiah 60, verses one to three.
[time=3040] Arise, it says, wake up, shine for your what?
[time=3045] Say it, for your light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you, for behold, darkness will cover the earth.
[time=3053] Does it, yes or no?
[time=3055] Yes, and deep darkness covers the peoples.
[time=3059] Does it, yes or no?
[time=3060] Yes, but, but the Lord, in the midst of that, the Lord will rise upon you and his glory will appear on you.
[time=3070] Nations will come to your what?
[time=3074] Light and kings to the brightness of your rising.
[time=3078] Even in Acts in the New Testament, go to Acts.
[time=3082] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts 13.
[time=3085] Paul, here who wrote Philippians, talking about the movement forward that the early church was needing to make toward the Gentiles, those who weren't Jews, the nations, if you will.
[time=3098] This is all so cool, it just all comes together.
[time=3102] Look at 13.47, for so, here's Paul, announcing this to the Gentiles, for so the Lord has commanded us, I have placed you as a light for the Gentiles, that you the church may bring salvation to the end of the earth, quoting from Isaiah 42.
[time=3123] When the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord.
[time=3129] And as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed, right there, and the word of the Lord was being spread through the whole region by those who knew the Lord, love the Lord.
[time=3143] Sometimes my friends, it's just really good to get really clear on this.
[time=3154] And so I'm gonna try and be really honest and really clear with every one of you here in this room this morning, those of you watching on the broadcast, it is ultimately, it is most importantly, why, as a believer, you are here.
[time=3168] This is why you are here.
[time=3175] And I know, I know so many of you, I know you have families, and I know you have jobs, and I know you have hobbies, and I know you have areas of interest, and I know God is even using you in a number of different ways.
[time=3188] I know there are things in this world that draw you, that attract you and me both, but I wanna remind you this morning that this is our calling.
[time=3199] You are here to reach others.
[time=3205] You are here to bring glory to God as you reach others.
[time=3211] And his design has always been to reach them through his people.
[time=3216] And you are his people.
[time=3220] And this is why you are here.
[time=3223] Bottom line, and too many times, we just like blameless and innocent, too many times we brush by it, so I just didn't wanna brush by it today.
[time=3232] This is why you're here.
[time=3235] This is what should consume you and me.
[time=3237] Reaching others with strong, worked out faith.
[time=3244] God's people being so intentional about obedience and living out their faith boldly and lovingly that their dark world is lit, their dark world is impacted.
[time=3257] This dark world which encompasses them is enlightened by the light and power
[time=3267] of their spiritual muscle and their devotion to God.
[time=3274] Why don't you bow your heads right where you're at, close your eyes, let me just read this to you.
[time=3277] There's some things that'll dim your light.
[time=3278] There are some things, let me just say it to you this way, I know 'cause I know you and I know me.
[time=3287] And I know that there are things that dim our lights.
[time=3292] And I wanna just give you a chance this morning as we close, gonna ask Steve Webster to come and pray for us as we dismiss this morning.
[time=3302] And I wanna just give you a chance to think about this.
[time=3305] My friend's unconfessed sin, ongoing patterns of sin can dim your light.
[time=3313] Shallow distractions, I mean I know there are things
[time=3320] that you enjoy and I know that they're not evil in and of themselves but when it comes to this, if in any way, shape or form, your pursuit of that is diminishing your pursuit of this, it's shallow, and it's a distraction because it's just not that important.
[time=3338] Sin can dim your light, shallow distractions can dim your light.
[time=3344] You know what, just selfishness.
[time=3348] You and me just some days just saying, you know what, I don't want to.
[time=3352] I'd rather sleep, I'd rather play, I'd rather watch, I'd rather waste, I'd rather, I'd rather, I, I.
[time=3360] And God says, wow, I wanted you to be my possession.
[time=3365] I wanted you to be my priest.
[time=3368] I set you right in the middle of daily opportunities.
[time=3371] Oh, he's just begging you and me that we would be.
[time=3374] Not grumblers, not complainers.
[time=3379] Living with character above reproach and not letting go of this gospel of life.
[time=3387] I want you to think about that.
[time=3392] And I'll ask Steve to come and close us this morning.
[time=3395] Father, you have made us the light of the world,
[time=3403] a city on a hill.
[time=3408] And too often we retreat into the shadows.
[time=3413] Too often we remove ourself from culture
[time=3419] or we embrace it instead of being a force, God as you've called us for redemption.
[time=3428] May we, Father, this week shine as lights in a crooked and perverse generation.
[time=3437] Because we used to be crooked and perverse and we would be God without the intervention of your son, Jesus.
[time=3446] He made himself nothing, Father.
[time=3450] So whatever I'm holding onto you, whatever advantages I might have that I might wanna play my cards about to be selfish.
[time=3459] May I remember his example.
[time=3463] And Lord, may I remember also that you have made all these things possible in him.
[time=3468] You have given us his righteousness.
[time=3472] May we tell that story.
[time=3473] God, it is a story worth telling.
[time=3476] Help us to tell it well.
[time=3478] Dismiss us now in your grace with the confidence to know that you have done all that's necessary for our salvation and that you will be with us always.
[time=3489] We pray this in Jesus' name.
[time=3491] [AMEN] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[time=3525] (upbeat music)
