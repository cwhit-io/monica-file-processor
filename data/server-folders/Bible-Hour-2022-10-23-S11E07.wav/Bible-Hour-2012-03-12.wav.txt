[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, good morning and welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It's great to be with you and I'm thankful for these few moments that we get to share together.
[time=38] If you're new to the broadcast, let me introduce myself to you.
[time=42] My name's Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege and have had the privilege for 16 years of being on the team here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=51] It is an amazing family of people.
[time=53] It is an incredible team that I get to work with each and every week, and on a weekly basis, it is our hope and desire to bring to you, those of you in our broadcast audience, the teaching of God's Word and the spirit of what God is doing in this place, in these people, it is amazing for me to get to be a part of it, and we're thankful each and every week for the broadcast opportunity, the chance to bring to you the life-changing eternity-altering truth of God's Word.
[time=83] Doesn't matter who you are, doesn't matter what circumstance you're in, doesn't matter how old you are, doesn't matter if you're red, yellow, black, or white, white collar, blue collar, old, young, or in between, the Word of God has a message, we believe, it's pertinent and relevant to where you live, each and every day, and so we're thankful that we get to bring it to you.
[time=104] I want to just invite you, I do this every once in a while, I want to invite you to go to our website at blackhawkministries.org, and just take 10 minutes, and just kind of click around.
[time=114] I know many of you maybe are aware of it, but others of you maybe have not gone to the site, there are so many things for you there, chances for you to leave us messages, you can write us a note, and we'll get it, you can go to our media section and watch messages from previous Bible hour broadcasts, you can see what's upcoming in the life of our church and ministry, you can learn more about our school, what an amazing school God has given us, Blackhawk Christian School, preschool all the way through 12th grade, approaching 900 students total.
[time=148] We're growing like we've never grown before, there are more kids and families inside our four walls than we've ever had, we're so grateful that God has given us the chance to invest, not only in education into our kids, but the word of God and the spirit of God and the people of God, all coming together to form quite a family at Blackhawk Christian, we'd love for you to look into that.
[time=170] If there's any questions about anything you see on our website, please give us a call, we'd love to help you out.
[time=176] Hey, God bless you.
[time=177] Thank you so much for tuning in this morning, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=182] - Well, I've never been to heaven, yet I miss it.
[time=187] Eden's in my blood.
[time=189] The best things of life are souvenirs from Eden, appetizers of the new earth.
[time=197] There are just enough of them to keep us going, but never enough to make us satisfied with the world as it is, or ourselves as we are.
[time=208] We live between Eden and the new earth,
[time=214] pulled toward what we once were, and what we yet will be.
[time=219] - Nearly every Christian I have spoken with has some idea that eternity is an unending church service.
[time=227] We have settled on the image of the never-ending sing along in the sky, one great hymn after another, forever and ever, amen.
[time=236] And our hearts sink forever and ever.
[time=241] That's it.
[time=242] That's the good news.
[time=243] And then we sigh and feel guilty that we are not more spiritual.
[time=249] We lose heart, and we turn once more to the present, to find what life we can.
[time=256] - Most of us would love to spend the evening with a great author, musician, artist, or head of the state.
[time=264] God is the master artist who created the universe,
[time=271] the inventor of music, the author and main character of the unfolding drama of redemption.
[time=280] Head of state, he's the king of the entire universe.
[time=285] - We think of ourselves as fun loving and of God as a humorless killjoy.
[time=291] But we've got it backward.
[time=293] It's not God who's boring, it's us.
[time=296] Did we invent, went, humor and laughter?
[time=301] No, God did.
[time=302] We will never begin to exhaust God's sense of humor and his love for adventure.
[time=308] The real question is this, how could God not be bored with us?
[time=314] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 252 seconds]
[time=571] I suspect that every saved soul in heaven is a great wonder, and that heaven is a vast museum of wonders, of grace and mercy, a palace of miracles
[time=586] in which everything will surprise everyone who gets there.
[time=592] Something better awaits and beckons us all.
[time=595] We shall be like the angels, which means not neutered and even experienced, but full, free and liberated persons in whom all the possibilities of our God-given humanity will burst forth in undreamed up fulfillment.
[time=611] We want to serve God more, but we have to sleep.
[time=616] We want to pray and study the Bible, but we grow weary.
[time=622] In heaven, our bodies will do whatever we want them to do.
[time=627] We will possess boundless energy with which to serve God.
[time=632] Christian, meditate much on heaven.
[time=637] It will help thee to press on and to forget the toil of the way.
[time=642] This veil of tears is but the pathway to a better country.
[time=646] This world of woe is but the stepping stone to a world of bliss.
[time=651] And after death, what comeeth?
[time=654] What wonder world will open upon our astonished sight?
[time=660] I dream of a city called glory.
[time=672] So bright and so fair.
[time=684] When I entered the gates, I cried wholly.
[time=696] The angels all met with their.
[time=706] They carried me from mention to mention.
[time=717] And all the sights I saw.
[time=727] But I said, I want to see Jesus the one who died for all.
[time=747] I shout all my knees and cry wholly.
[time=758] Holy, holy, I clap my hands and sing wholly.
[time=776] Glory to the Son of God.
[time=799] As I entered the gates of that city.
[time=809] My loved ones all knew me well.
[time=820] They took me down the streets of heaven.
[time=829] All the scenes to many to tell.
[time=839] I saw a favorite hand.
[time=848] Jake up and I said.
[time=854] Talked with Mark and Timothy.
[time=864] But I said, Timothy, I want to see Jesus.
[time=877] 'Cause He's the one who died for all of me.
[time=887] And I shout all my knees and cry.
[time=894] Holy, holy, holy, holy.
[time=906] God is holy, I clap my hands and sing.
[time=935] Glory, holy, holy, holy.
[time=955] Glory, holy, holy, holy to the Son of God.
[time=970] I sing glory to the Son of God.
[time=985] Holy, holy, holy, holy.
[time=998] Lord, God Almighty.
[time=1004] Early in the morning.
[time=1010] Our song shall rise to thee.
[time=1016] Holy, holy, holy.
[time=1022] Perciful and mighty.
[time=1028] God in three persons.
[time=1033] Blessed Trinity.
[time=1041] Holy, holy, holy.
[time=1053] Lord, God Almighty.
[time=1059] All thy words shall praise thy name in earth.
[time=1066] God in three persons.
[time=1073] Blessed Trinity.
[time=1080] God in three persons.
[time=1087] Blessed Trinity.
[time=1093] God in three persons.
[time=1099] Blessed Trinity.
[time=1111] You are holy.
[time=1119] Blessed Trinity.
[time=1126] You are mighty.
[time=1139] You are holy.
[time=1153] Open your Bibles if you would, please, to Philippians chapter two.
[time=1157] We're going to come back to our study of the book of Philippians.
[time=1160] And I want to say to you right out of the gate this morning that what we're going to find at the end of chapter two in Philippians, which is right where we left off, is Paul's going to be together.
[time=1168] Paul's going to be talking to the folks at Philippi about two guys that are really, really important to him.
[time=1175] Two ministry partners, two men who we learn a lot about in our passage today.
[time=1182] The church at Philippi was in need of their encouragement.
[time=1186] The church at Philippi was in need of strong spiritual leadership.
[time=1192] And he talks about Timothy and he talks about Epaphroditus.
[time=1197] And as he talks about Timothy and Epaphroditus, he talks about personal character.
[time=1204] He talks about things that they'll do.
[time=1206] He describes them in a way whereby we will gain a picture today of God honoring spiritual leadership.
[time=1218] Those who lead in the church.
[time=1222] And I want, as we begin this morning, I want you to think of one, think of a spiritual leader in the church.
[time=1229] I don't care, I mean, current, present, past, just think about a leader, a spiritual leader who you've experienced, who in your opinion has experienced in their leading great success.
[time=1243] I want you to think about an individual in spiritual leadership who as you've experienced them or you watched others experience them, there was a great sense of he or she really got it right.
[time=1258] And I want you on the flip side of that thought to just, and again, we're not going to go judgmental on them.
[time=1265] I just want you to have in your mind someone maybe who hasn't done so well.
[time=1273] And as you think about a spiritual leader, maybe from your experience or from the past who hasn't done so well and as you envision one that you can remember who has, what was the difference?
[time=1287] What are things that begin to come to your mind that separate those who lead well and those who don't?
[time=1297] And with that in mind, I want to bring you to our discussion this morning, the truth, the truth about ministry.
[time=1304] You know, one could make an argument that over the years, the greatest damage done to the reputation and/or effectiveness of the church has in fact been done by those who have led it.
[time=1317] Church leaders have been hurting the church effort since the day it began, while there have always been those who have faithfully done it right.
[time=1326] The moral, ethical, personal, spiritual failure of so many church leaders has hindered its potential for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years.
[time=1341] And while the passage we come to this morning in our ongoing study of Philippians isn't by any stretch and exhaustive treatment of the church leader issue.
[time=1352] We do find some real nuggets of truth here today, my friends, some great principles regarding ministry in the church and those who lead it.
[time=1363] I am convinced, I told first hour this morning, convinced that those of us who lead need to hear these things and study these truths and understand and embrace the implications of this.
[time=1376] I'm equally convinced that those of you who don't lead, those of you who are led in the church need to understand and see these things as well.
[time=1388] Why do you think?
[time=1391] It's the question we'll start out with this morning.
[time=1393] Why a message on church leaders is so important for those who don't lead.
[time=1402] Number one, I hope you'll write these down, I really believe as we come to the scriptures this morning in this passage that gives us this insight into church leaders and who they should be and how they should function.
[time=1413] I believe it really allows you to evaluate.
[time=1417] And I know you do and I believe to a degree you should.
[time=1421] It allows for an evaluation of leaders based on biblical principle, not personal preference.
[time=1431] Does that make sense?
[time=1434] In other words, when you assess the effectiveness of a leader, what are you going to use as the grid through which you assess that leader?
[time=1445] Or are you going to use your preference when I've experienced that?
[time=1451] I can make light of it at times.
[time=1453] Other times it's been very personal and hurtful, but the fact of the matter is I have bumped into it in 25 years of ministry.
[time=1459] People who have assessed my leadership and they've used their personal preference as the grid through which they've judged me and that's how that goes.
[time=1469] Sometimes they don't like the way I talk, sometimes they don't like that I stand down here instead of at the door, sometimes they don't like how I dress.
[time=1479] Can you imagine that?
[time=1482] Seriously, come on.
[time=1485] We'll go Spartans this morning maybe, huh?
[time=1490] It happens.
[time=1491] It happens and again, we can sort of make light of it at times, but it's a very serious issue.
[time=1497] I don't think I should be or any church leader should be.
[time=1500] I don't think our elders should be.
[time=1502] I don't think our staff team should be.
[time=1504] I don't think a small group leader should.
[time=1506] I don't think anybody who leads should be judged, evaluated or assessed by anything other than the assessment that God provides for those who fill those positions.
[time=1519] And so I think it's important for us this morning as we come to our passes to understand, evaluation should be done based upon God's grid, not ours.
[time=1530] A message on church leaders is important for those who don't lead because watch this.
[time=1535] I think it provides a target.
[time=1537] I really get excited about this.
[time=1539] I think it provides a target for those desiring to one day help lead.
[time=1545] And I look at young people in this room today.
[time=1549] I sat many, many years ago in a seat just like the one you sit in.
[time=1554] And I look at you and I realize that many young people in this room today, young men and young women, will to some degree very likely be leading this or the church someday.
[time=1568] Many young people in this room with the gifts and talents that God has given you, with the gifts and talents that God bestowed upon you.
[time=1578] And you may not see it all right now.
[time=1580] You may not realize it all right now, but there may be in this room future leaders of his bride, the body of Christ, the church.
[time=1588] And I want to make sure that you begin to at a young age understand what really matters for you in that endeavor.
[time=1598] And it's not how well you talk.
[time=1600] And it's not how much you know.
[time=1602] It's who you what are.
[time=1607] It's who you are at the very core of your being.
[time=1611] I tweeted about it earlier in the week.
[time=1613] I was talking to somebody.
[time=1614] They just, it floored me. It was such a great conversation and they had heard from somebody else.
[time=1620] How is, and I probably won't say it right, but how is parents?
[time=1624] We oftentimes do our kids a huge disservice because we talk to them ad nauseum about what we want them to do when they grow up.
[time=1635] We talk to them and we try to inspire them by painting these pictures of what they can accomplish someday when what we should be talking with them about is who they can be.
[time=1650] As men and as women.
[time=1652] Integrity and character.
[time=1654] And these are the things that fill our passage this morning.
[time=1658] The things that matter most thirdly.
[time=1660] I think a message on church leaders is important for those who don't lead because it, it really, these principles that we'll see, they help you know those of you who would be interested.
[time=1670] And I know there are many.
[time=1672] They help you know how to pray.
[time=1675] If you're interested in praying for those of us that lead, this gives you a grid through which to pray for us.
[time=1683] I will tell you right now, every principle we talk about this morning, I desperately need help with.
[time=1694] You can pray for me.
[time=1696] You can pray I know for our team while there may be growth in me or in us on these fronts.
[time=1703] These are things we are in process on.
[time=1706] We need your prayers and we need your encouragement to be more of what God has required and called us to be.
[time=1716] Open your Bibles and look with me at the end of chapter 2 verses 19 to 30.
[time=1721] Would you stand in honor of God's word?
[time=1723] Would you do that this morning?
[time=1724] Let me read this to you.
[time=1726] Paul writing to the church at Philippi.
[time=1728] Here comes some very important principles on the church and leadership.
[time=1733] I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition.
[time=1743] For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare.
[time=1750] For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.
[time=1755] But you know of His proven worth, Timothy, that He served with me and the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving His Father.
[time=1765] Therefore I hope to send Him immediately.
[time=1767] As soon as I see how things go with me and I trust in the Lord, but I myself also will be coming shortly.
[time=1773] But I thought it necessary to send to you a path for Titus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier,
[time=1781] who was also your messenger and minister to my need because he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.
[time=1789] For indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him and not on him only but also on me so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow.
[time=1800] Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly so that when you see him again, you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you.
[time=1807] You receive him then in the Lord with all joy and hold men like him in what?
[time=1816] In high regard because he comes close because he came close to death for the work of Christ,
[time=1826] risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me.
[time=1833] Father God, we pray this morning as we begin that your word would do in us what only it can do.
[time=1840] Oh God, as we read about, think about, talk about and give thought to leadership in the church,
[time=1847] those who spiritually oversee and give direction and the way in which God you've designed us to do that.
[time=1854] Oh Father, I pray that there would be a like-minded desire in this whole room.
[time=1861] Those paid, those not paid, those on the team, those in the pew, God continued to allow there to be this sense of togetherness
[time=1870] as we as a family together lift up your truth and your principles and then God as we flesh it out.
[time=1878] I pray that you'd help us to apply these things with great wisdom.
[time=1881] Thank you for the gathering this morning, so good Father, to be together with those that love and care for not only you but each other.
[time=1890] Give us insight as we study in your son's name, we pray. Amen.
[time=1894] All right, let's jump in.
[time=1896] Spiritual leadership, here you go, principle number one for you this morning.
[time=1900] You find it, look at verses 20 and 21, those who lead must do so with a genuine love.
[time=1906] Those who lead in the church, my friends must do so with a genuine love.
[time=1912] And I know it might sound obvious, but let me just ask the question, a genuine love for who?
[time=1916] A genuine love for people is what's clearly implied.
[time=1923] First point to make, and let's be very clear about it, the endeavor of the church is people.
[time=1930] The target of the church's mission is people.
[time=1934] Some might say, well, wait, I thought bringing glory to God was our ultimate aim.
[time=1938] It is, and glory is brought to God when the church models his love and his holiness and his justice
[time=1945] as we reflect him to people, to people.
[time=1950] Ministry is about a heart for, a love for people.
[time=1959] It seeks to reach them, it seeks to teach them, it seeks to shepherd, disciple, and care for people.
[time=1967] Ministry, biblical ministry seeks to admonish, and even one day, present people complete to Christ.
[time=1977] Do you understand this?
[time=1978] Most of you in the room, others, you may be learning this for the first time this morning.
[time=1981] It's really true.
[time=1983] Colossians 1, 28, and a few other passages talk about how there will be a day when I will,
[time=1990] and others will stand before God and give an account for your completeness.
[time=1997] You being brought down this road of spiritual growth, says in Colossians 1, 28,
[time=2004] we proclaim him admonishing every man, teaching every man.
[time=2007] It's about people with all wisdom so that we may present every man complete in Christ
[time=2014] and how did Paul give himself to that endeavor?
[time=2017] It says in 29, it goes on to say, "For this purpose also I labor, striving according to his power,
[time=2024] which mightily works within me." This is a foundational passage for those of us in leadership here at Blackhawk.
[time=2032] This is a verse, verses that we refer to often.
[time=2035] It is at the core of my own being and heart for what God has given me the privilege of being a part of here.
[time=2042] It's about people.
[time=2043] God will not ask me on that day.
[time=2046] He will not say, "Present to me your buildings." He will not say to me, "Present to me your books." He will not say to me, "Present to me your accomplishments." He will say, "Present to me your people." Ministry is about people and those who do it better have a real genuine love for them.
[time=2070] There better be something in your soul, whoever you are involved in leading.
[time=2076] On the spiritual front, there better be something deep in your soul that stirs.
[time=2081] When you hear us talk about, when you hear the word paint this picture of those who genuinely love,
[time=2089] God honoring church leaders are consumed with growing and helping and loving people.
[time=2094] And the second thing to say on this is the transverse.
[time=2098] They are not consumed with who?
[time=2101] With themselves.
[time=2103] Sadly, some in Paul's day, you saw it right there in the text.
[time=2108] You go back to 2021 for they all seek after their own interests.
[time=2116] In Paul's day, as he's trying to find somebody to go and care for these people spiritually,
[time=2122] he's frustrated because there's so many people in that mix, if you will, he couldn't send because they're selfish, because they're self-seeking, because they weren't really interested in the needs of the people.
[time=2135] They were mostly interested in their own needs and what was going on in Paul's day continues to go on in our day and the sad truth is that there are those who today
[time=2146] find ways to do ministry for financial gain.
[time=2153] It's true.
[time=2155] There are those who find ways to do ministry today in the church for financial profit.
[time=2164] They find ways to make money off the very backs of their people.
[time=2168] There are those who do ministry today in a way that provides them with personal power,
[time=2175] personal prestige, personal privilege.
[time=2178] There are those who do ministry today.
[time=2181] They lead in a way that seeks to make much of them, not him.
[time=2186] They want their reputation heightened.
[time=2189] They want their name enlarged.
[time=2192] They want their reach extended.
[time=2195] There are those today who do ministry for the very same reasons that some in Paul's day were doing it
[time=2201] and he didn't want to have anything to do with him.
[time=2207] There were some then who did it for control, power, and authority over people.
[time=2214] Paul says, "I'm going to send you Timothy because I know he'll love you.
[time=2222] I know he'll pursue the Lord's interest for you and not his own."
[time=2228] It sounds nice, doesn't it?
[time=2230] It sounds refreshing.
[time=2232] It sounds honest.
[time=2234] It sounds loving.
[time=2235] It sounds genuine.
[time=2236] I'll tell you what, I've been encouraged really over the years on this front.
[time=2240] Certainly there are situations where I've been discouraged when I've seen certain things in play on this front.
[time=2247] What a joy in the last few years to just have a few opportunities.
[time=2251] Not many, but to have a few opportunities to sit with because of my relationship
[time=2257] and the opportunity God's given me to be over at Willow Creek with Pastor Bill.
[time=2262] Hibles over there, Bill has made a huge investment in me and so many other senior pastors who are a part of the Willow Creek Association.
[time=2270] In the midst of that, we've had the chance to meet and sit with a number of men who have been very encouraging and who have themselves even invested in us, have been absolutely blown away by what I've seen in those times and experienced
[time=2286] with one of them in particular, Pastor Rick Warren out at Saddleback in Orange County.
[time=2292] It was interesting to sit with Rick in a number of settings and at the prodding of Bill.
[time=2300] He didn't want to talk about it at first, but as Bill would ask him and encourage him to share with us his journey,
[time=2308] he began to share with us a little bit about his experience after the purpose-driven life.
[time=2314] Most of you may know, purpose-driven life right now currently at about 25 to 30 million copies
[time=2321] sold over $450 million in profit.
[time=2327] Millions, probably, of those dollars have ended up in Rick's pocket, he and his wife's.
[time=2334] And so I understand that's a starting point that's a little different starting point than your experience or mine, but it's just been encouraging to know about a year and a half after the book came out.
[time=2344] Rick and Kay decided that they would, from that point on, live on 10% of their income
[time=2351] and give away on a monthly basis 90.
[time=2356] What a great example.
[time=2358] I don't care how much we're talking about, a willingness to live on 10 and give away 90.
[time=2363] It was about a year and a half after the book came out that he officially rescinded his entire salary
[time=2369] from Saddleback, a church of thousands and thousands and tens of thousands of people and a budget of millions and millions and millions of dollars, and yet he said no more for me.
[time=2380] Not only did he do that, but they decided at that point to pay back Saddleback.
[time=2385] After 30 years of ministry, they paid Saddleback back every penny they'd ever paid him.
[time=2393] One check wrote a check for everything.
[time=2397] They'd ever paid him from the day he started.
[time=2400] I love this, the GMC Sierra pickup that he drove when he took that manuscript to the publisher
[time=2406] for the first time that day in LA is the same GMC Sierra pickup he drives today.
[time=2412] Still doesn't wear socks when he preaches, still owns two sport coats.
[time=2417] I'm going to try that, by the way.
[time=2419] I think it's a very California thing to do.
[time=2423] But I say all that really not to lift up a guy, I say all that to lift up a principle.
[time=2429] Amen?
[time=2430] There is a humility that you just sense and you see in someone who gets this right.
[time=2438] And Paul just makes a great, great point here.
[time=2441] Genuine love for others, not a genuine love of you is the mark of one who leads.
[time=2449] Number two, one of the great qualities, the greatest quality, in my opinion, of a church
[time=2455] leader is a readiness to what?
[time=2457] Say it, church, to serve.
[time=2460] Capital S, all caps, bold.
[time=2462] Just circle it, underline it.
[time=2464] And I want you to, I would want you to gauge me by this.
[time=2468] I would want you to gauge our team by this principle.
[time=2471] One of the great qualities of a church leader is a readiness to serve.
[time=2477] I think in verse 22, but you know of this proven worth, that he served with me.
[time=2483] It's interesting, proven worth, but you know of his value.
[time=2487] And when it comes to his value, Paul initially doesn't talk about his speaking.
[time=2492] Paul initially doesn't talk about anything but this great foundational quality of serving.
[time=2501] He says how he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel, like a child.
[time=2507] Don't miss this, like a child serving his father.
[time=2512] No, I don't know where you go when you read that.
[time=2516] I know that there might be a few of you in the room like me who can think of times where your children didn't serve you very well.
[time=2524] I understand that.
[time=2525] Sometimes you ask them to do something and it gets done obligatory.
[time=2530] It gets done with a sense of oh gosh, do I have to?
[time=2535] He's not talking about that.
[time=2537] There are times I can think of many.
[time=2541] When I've asked my kids to do something more better yet, when I didn't ask them to do anything, right?
[time=2550] And yet because of their love for me, why I sometimes don't know.
[time=2556] But they're great, deep, enduring love for me.
[time=2562] They do something hard, like strenuous, like out of the box, like really?
[time=2568] And they do it with this sense of oh dad, I want you to be what?
[time=2574] Please.
[time=2576] And this is the kind of service to the Father that Paul describes here, this willingness
[time=2583] to go to great lengths, to roll up one's sleeves, and give an effort of service like a child
[time=2592] does to a father.
[time=2594] I love what he's saying here.
[time=2595] And I want you to turn to Matthew 20.
[time=2597] We're only going to turn one place this morning.
[time=2600] No really, no real need to turn any other place than Matthew 2024.
[time=2606] Oh church, I want you to see this.
[time=2609] I want you to read this.
[time=2612] Jesus was a servant leader and anyone trying to lead better be one as well.
[time=2625] It says in 24 and hearing this, the 10 became indignant with the two brothers, but Jesus
[time=2631] called them to himself and said, you know what the current landscape in our culture is regarding
[time=2640] leadership.
[time=2642] You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lorded over them.
[time=2647] And their great men exercise authority over them.
[time=2652] Stop right there.
[time=2653] That is what I just read.
[time=2655] That is what we were saying just a few moments ago.
[time=2658] That is, I want to make money off you.
[time=2661] That is, I want to be powerful and prestigious in front of you.
[time=2665] That is, I want to control you.
[time=2668] That is how the world perceives leadership.
[time=2672] I love this next line.
[time=2674] It is not this way among you.
[time=2679] In the kingdom of God, my friends, we do it differently.
[time=2684] But whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your what?
[time=2688] Say it church out loud.
[time=2690] And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your what?
[time=2693] Say it just as the son of man did not come to be served but to what?
[time=2698] Say it and to give his life.
[time=2704] Do you see that?
[time=2705] This is a leader.
[time=2708] One who gives his life away.
[time=2715] Not irresponsibly.
[time=2717] I'm not talking about that.
[time=2720] Not without wisdom.
[time=2722] I'm not talking about that.
[time=2723] I'm talking about the level of the depth of desire.
[time=2727] He loves those people that much and he loves the cause that much.
[time=2734] And there is that great a desire in him to make much of God and not him.
[time=2738] And he knows these people at some point will be presented, complete or incomplete.
[time=2744] And so he gives, like Jesus did, he gives his life.
[time=2749] What a picture, a ransom for many.
[time=2754] All authority, all power, all strength, all might was given him and how did he use it?
[time=2765] He served.
[time=2766] Sleeves rolled up all the time, gave himself away, helped the difficult, helped the disabled,
[time=2772] helped the disenfranchised, helped the dying.
[time=2774] Sleeves rolled up wherever he went, whoever he comes in contact with.
[time=2779] He fed that crowd.
[time=2780] He healed him.
[time=2781] He brought their son or daughter back to life.
[time=2783] He stopped the woman's bleeding.
[time=2785] He removed the demon.
[time=2786] He saved the wedding, endured the cross, serving, giving, offering himself to others.
[time=2792] Church leaders, church elders, staff members, small group leaders, ABF leaders.
[time=2798] Show me a leader who doesn't serve and I'll show you a fraud.
[time=2803] Because that is not leading unless there is service.
[time=2810] Selfless, Sleeves rolled up service.
[time=2813] Number three.
[time=2814] And before I mention this one too, I'm going to ask you a question.
[time=2818] It was interesting.
[time=2819] The response we got first hour, before I show you this next point, I want you to, I wonder how you would if I just kind of gave you the chance to say it out loud, which I won't, but I want you to say it to yourself.
[time=2829] How would you fill in this blank?
[time=2832] Ministry, in God's design here, we're going to talk about this, but I want you to think
[time=2838] about it.
[time=2839] Ministry is what?
[time=2840] If you were going to answer that for me, if you were going to answer that for Webby
[time=2848] or Jesse or Janice or Corbin or our elders or just somebody you know who's engaged maybe
[time=2854] in the, you know, the every day of ministry, how would you answer that?
[time=2860] Ministry is what, don't say it out loud, but think of something.
[time=2868] Ministry is viewed as, ministry is experienced as, my view of ministry is that ministry is
[time=2876] what?
[time=2877] I wonder what words or thoughts come to your mind.
[time=2883] Let me read this verse and then I'll tell you what we see here in our passage, back to Philippians 2.25, it says this, so powerful, but I thought it necessary to send to you
[time=2898] a paphroditis, my brother and fellow worker and fellow, what?
[time=2909] Say it louder, soldier.
[time=2914] Truth is, my friends, and it's a good thing, but ministry is war.
[time=2925] Money for those who are truly and really engaged in it is a fight.
[time=2934] It is a battle.
[time=2939] Don't ever forget somebody once said that culture isn't the opponent of our ministry
[time=2945] efforts.
[time=2946] No, we're not up against materialism or humanism or postmodernism, the challenge that those in ministry face and their efforts to bring redemption and hope to a hurting helpless world isn't secular thought or false religion.
[time=2958] No, the greatest challenge we face in ministry is Satan, Satan himself.
[time=2968] I have, I'll stay PG here because of the crowd, but the truth is I've seen this.
[time=2977] Others of you in the room have.
[time=2978] I've seen Satan at work.
[time=2983] I've watched him in some situations.
[time=2986] Sometimes he does it very overtly and very painfully.
[time=2989] It's an awful thing to see someone who is possessed, it's an awful thing to see someone
[time=2996] who is under the influence of, it's an awful thing to see somebody in the chains of Satan.
[time=3004] It's incredible as you watch ministry trying to go forward to these people at times of
[time=3010] the fight and the battle that goes on.
[time=3014] I have over the years been in situations where I have been face to face with that and it is something I would never, ever wish on any of you.
[time=3022] It is something that has scared me to my bones because it has reminded me of the reality
[time=3030] of this statement that I just read you, Satan hates the church.
[time=3037] Satan hates and despises those who are committed to leading it and he stops at nothing to thwart
[time=3044] and hinder ministry, which is why leading in the church requires soldiers.
[time=3053] Let me say it to you this way, that's why it's so important that we have soldiers leading
[time=3059] it.
[time=3062] Not financial gainers, not prestige and power hunters, not consumers, no, no, no, we need
[time=3074] soldiers who are willing to fight a battle that is described for us in Ephesians 6.
[time=3081] Maybe you've read this before, maybe this morning in light of our brief conversation here, you can read it with new eyes, but please look at Ephesians.
[time=3090] Go back a book, back a letter, Ephesians 6.10, these words take on a whole new light.
[time=3096] Finally, he says, "Be strong in the Lord," and here he's talking to the church, not just leaders, certainly those are included, but here it's for all of us to see, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might, put on the full armor of God so that you will
[time=3112] be able to stand firm against what?
[time=3116] What is it that's coming at you?
[time=3119] What is it that we're having to deal with?
[time=3122] The schemes of the devil are what we encounter, schemes of the devil for our struggle is not
[time=3132] against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places, and
[time=3144] so soldiers, he says, put on verse 13, put on the full armor of God.
[time=3150] Schemes of the devil, will you write this down?
[time=3152] Schemes of the devil, what is it that we're facing each and every day?
[time=3155] What is it that I as a leader face in this war of ministry?
[time=3161] Schemes of the devil in the Greek, it means clever, crafty, cunning lies.
[time=3167] Ever crafty, cunning lies.
[time=3170] Evil deception at the highest, most complex level.
[time=3174] It is a deception that is ultimately promoted and communicated through the world's system and culture over which he rules.
[time=3182] He rules, you know that right, over our culture, our world's system, and it's carried out by
[time=3188] the legions of very real demon hosts.
[time=3195] Our struggle, I want to say this to you, then we're going to start to wrap it up.
[time=3199] Our struggle, you see that in verse 12, for our struggle.
[time=3203] What is this?
[time=3204] I'll tell you what, when you look at that phrase, our struggle in the original language, it gives some real sobering perspective.
[time=3214] That phrase, our struggle is hand-to-hand combat.
[time=3216] It means to literally wrestle.
[time=3219] Did you hear that, hand-to-hand combat is what we are engaged in to literally wrestle.
[time=3226] What's the significance of this?
[time=3227] He is not, oh church, listen, he is not to be viewed as some distant precaution.
[time=3234] He is not a far away waving yellow flag.
[time=3239] No, no.
[time=3241] Your attempt to avoid him and his schemes in your daily routines, your parenting, your
[time=3247] private life won't work because he is right here.
[time=3252] He is right in your grille.
[time=3256] He is close.
[time=3257] He is ready to put his hands on you and you better be ready to fight.
[time=3264] Fist to fist, blow for blow, wrestling with, fighting against, wants to kill you, wants
[time=3277] to kill ministry, wants to kill those who lead.
[time=3279] He wants to, as we talked about last week, he wants to stop the light from penetrating
[time=3286] the darkness.
[time=3288] You want to lead?
[time=3290] In the church, you better be ready to lead against that.
[time=3298] Serious stuff, serious stuff.
[time=3303] Look with me if you would, as we close this morning, in fact, I want to just ask if you
[time=3309] would stand and as you stand, I want to draw your attention to them.
[time=3314] The end of our passage here, you won't see this on the screen, but let me just say this to you.
[time=3320] I think it's important that we give the passage.
[time=3324] It's full respect.
[time=3325] It says that 29 and 30, it says, "Receive him then in the Lord with all joy and hold men
[time=3334] like him in what?
[time=3337] In high regard." Because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service.
[time=3347] Let me say this to those of you in this room, those of you who are a part of this family,
[time=3354] those servants among you, those who lead spiritually in your life, listen, those who
[time=3360] have evidenced a genuine love for you, those who haven't used you but have served you,
[time=3372] those who have in their efforts with you shown themselves to be willing to face the enemy
[time=3379] with and for you, to stand and fight a war for what's true and right and good, those individuals,
[time=3386] the Scripture says to you today are worthy of your respect.
[time=3390] They are worthy of your honor.
[time=3393] I want to stand here this morning and thank you as a family.
[time=3396] I have been enormously far from perfect on this and yet over the years as a family you
[time=3406] have shown me great respect and honor.
[time=3409] You don't stand here this morning really deficient in this.
[time=3412] If you feel like there's something you need to work on, on the honoring and respecting
[time=3418] front as it relates to anybody who leads in your life, I would encourage you to make that right or send a card or give a hug or an encouraging word.
[time=3428] But I want to just say thank you for being an honoring and respecting family.
[time=3434] I believe God is honored.
[time=3435] I know leaders are encouraged by that.
[time=3439] It means the world to them and their families and their teams.
[time=3444] And so praise God for what He's done in you on that front and would you just continue to pray for us.
[time=3450] Again, not an exhaustive list but on the things that we've talked about this morning, would you pray for our team and our leaders.
[time=3458] This is truly who we want to be and this is how we want to be defined and remembered and
[time=3464] so we'll continue to bring ourselves to the standard, not of your preference, but of God's
[time=3470] principles.
[time=3471] In the days to come and I pray you'll help us in that way.
[time=3494] [MUSIC], and I pray you'll help us in that way.
[time=3524] [MUSIC]
