[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] [MUSIC - 20 seconds]
[time=61] (audience applauding) - But God, we dedicate this time to you.
[time=69] You're the great Redeemer, the one who did that.
[time=71] You washed our sins away.
[time=73] You restored us and you've made us new creatures in Christ.
[time=76] And we offer you our praises today in Jesus' name.
[time=80] [MUSIC - 181 seconds]
[time=264] Let's sing the chorus again.
[time=266] [MUSIC - 46 seconds]
[time=315] (audience applauds) - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=321] It's great to be with you today.
[time=323] So thankful that you've tuned in and what you will see today is something that I've been looking forward to for a long time.
[time=330] I'm so grateful for Corbin and Tanya Miller.
[time=333] Most of you know Corbin and Tanya.
[time=335] Corbin is our worship pastor, has been for a number of years.
[time=338] And Tanya has been a part of our worship team and part of our family here at Black Hawk for all those years.
[time=345] Today on the broadcast, you're gonna see a dramatic, kind of a one person dramatic presentation of what is called the history of redemption.
[time=355] And Tanya has spent months memorizing this whole thing.
[time=359] It is the story of the Bible.
[time=361] It is the story of God's design for mankind.
[time=365] It is the beginning and the end of all that God has accomplished and done on our behalf.
[time=372] It is an amazing look back at really God's unfolding salvation story, his love for, his pursuit of, his dealings with all of mankind in about 20, 25 minutes.
[time=387] You're gonna be absolutely amazed and I think you'll be really encouraged as well.
[time=391] I want you to listen, whoever you are, whether you know the Lord, whether you're still on a spiritual journey, whether you're far from God this morning and you have no idea why you've tuned in to watch church on TV.
[time=404] Whoever you are, I want you to watch.
[time=407] As Tanya gives her heart and soul to a proclamation of God's design for all of mankind.
[time=414] And I hope as you watch it, I hope that the spirit of God will move in you.
[time=419] I am so looking forward to not only you watching this, but really it's a precursor for what's gonna be happening in these next few weeks.
[time=427] You realize, don't you?
[time=428] That Resurrection Sunday is right around the corner and we are so thankful that we get to celebrate Easter with so many of you.
[time=437] I hope you'll make plans even now to come and be with us on Sunday morning, April 8th.
[time=442] It is going to be a phenomenal celebration of Christ and his death and his resurrection and the new life that we have in him, nine and 1045 on Sunday morning, April 8th, come and be with us.
[time=456] I can't wait to celebrate that day with so many of you, those of you who are a part of our broadcast family.
[time=464] Hey, watch this this morning.
[time=465] Be encouraged.
[time=466] I'm so thankful for what God's gonna do through the story, through the history of redemption.
[time=472] - Today marks our halfway point
[time=478] in the preparation for Resurrection Sunday morning.
[time=482] It's a six week journey that we're taking as a church family to study the different elements of following Jesus.
[time=488] And today is the halfway point, three weeks down, three more to go before we celebrate together, what we just sang about, how Jesus is risen.
[time=498] And we're looking forward to that celebration with you in just a few more weeks.
[time=502] The element that we're leading into this week is the one about Jesus devotion to the word of God and how we should imitate him with our own passion about the word of God.
[time=513] And I hope that you'll take advantage of the resources we've given you to study this element and experience this element throughout the rest of the week.
[time=520] And this morning, in honor of this element of following Jesus, we have something really special for you to experience this morning.
[time=527] About a year ago, I learned about this book called The History of Redemption.
[time=532] There's a pastor down in Texas who had spent some time teaching the big story of God, taking the plot points from Genesis through Revelation to kind of see what God was up to in history past, present, and once he had to come.
[time=546] And he ended up compiling this book that's filled with scriptures from the word of God that tell those main points.
[time=553] He also hired a freelance artist that went to his church and this artist created beautiful illustrations to go with every plot point in God's big story in the Bible.
[time=564] And so this morning, I'm excited because we've been waiting for the right time to show it to all of you, but my wife has learned the book and she's gonna present it for you this morning.
[time=573] And the artist, we contacted him and got permission to show you just today his photographs on the big screen, which is exciting and they're beautiful and inspirational.
[time=582] I think you'll enjoy them.
[time=584] We also have got some extra copies of the book because I think that some of you will enjoy it as much as I have and might want a copy of your own.
[time=592] We've got them at the information desk for $20 and all of the proceeds go to our alms offering for the preparation, the proceeds go to the vine.
[time=600] So consider getting one after the service today.
[time=603] Before we experience the history of redemption together, I'd like to take a minute to pray.
[time=607] So would you bow your heads and let me lead us in a word of prayer?
[time=610] God, your word is powerful.
[time=617] We know it because you've told us so and we're excited to hear it spoken to us today.
[time=623] God, the Bible also tells us that your word is precious.
[time=629] It's as precious as gold.
[time=632] And God, I pray that as your words fall on our ears today, we would perceive them as precious, more precious than the world's monetary system.
[time=640] God, your word tells us that the Bible is sweeter
[time=646] than honey from the comb.
[time=648] God, as we listen, would our souls experience the sweet taste of hearing your words?
[time=655] And God, the Bible tells us that your word is sharp and it is powerful and it's like a double-edged sword that pierces our souls.
[time=664] And as we listen, would you let your words pierce us?
[time=667] Help us know the difference between our flesh
[time=673] and what's not our flesh.
[time=674] And would you divide our souls today as we listen and experience the power of your word together?
[time=681] We ask all of these things in the name of your precious son, Jesus.
[time=685] [AMEN]
[time=700] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[time=705] The earth was without form and void and darkness was over the face of the deep and the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
[time=715] And God said, let there be light and there was light.
[time=718] God separated the light from the darkness and he saw that the light was good.
[time=723] And then God said, let us make a man in our image
[time=729] after our likeness and let him have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.
[time=740] So God created man in his own image in the image of God he created him.
[time=747] And God saw all that he had made and behold, it was very good.
[time=752] And then the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man,
[time=758] he made into woman and he brought her to him.
[time=762] And both the man and his wife were naked and they were not ashamed.
[time=765] And then the Lord commanded the man saying, you may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat.
[time=776] For in the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die.
[time=779] Surpin said to the woman, you shall not surely die.
[time=784] For God knows that when you eat of it, your eyes will be open and you will be like God knowing good and evil.
[time=791] So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was a delight to the eyes and that it was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and she ate.
[time=805] She also gave some to her husband who was with her and he ate, claiming to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.
[time=822] Therefore, God gave them up in the less of their hearts to impurity and to the dishonoring of their bodies because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who was blessed forever.
[time=838] And in the eyes of both were opened and they knew they were naked.
[time=845] For the creation had been subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it in hope.
[time=852] Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in all the earth and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
[time=865] Then the Lord said to the serpent, "I will put enmity between you and the woman, between your offspring and her offspring.
[time=874] And you shall bruise his heel and he shall bruise your head." Then the Lord said to Abram, "Go, go from your country
[time=883] and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you and I will make of you a great nation and I will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing.
[time=894] I will bless those who bless you and those who dishonor you I will curse and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed." And then he took him and he said, he took him outside and he said, "Number of stars if you are able to number them.
[time=915] So shall your offspring be." And he believed the Lord and the Lord counted it to him as righteousness.
[time=924] And Abraham became the father of Isaac and the sons of Isaac were Esau and Israel.
[time=930] Then the Lord brought Israel up from the land of Egypt and redeemed them from the house of slavery.
[time=938] But Israel did not listen to God's covenant and they refused to walk according to his law.
[time=947] They forgot the works and the wonders that he had shown them.
[time=953] When he killed them, they sought him.
[time=956] They repented and sought God earnestly.
[time=959] They remembered that God was their rock, that the most high God was their Redeemer, but they flattered him with their mouth and they lied to him with their tongues.
[time=969] They even sacrificed their own sons and daughters to the demons.
[time=974] They poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and their daughters.
[time=981] Then God gave them into the hand of the nations so that those who hated them ruled over them.
[time=989] Yet he, being compassionate, he atoned for their iniquity and he did not destroy them.
[time=997] He restrained his anger often and did not stir up all of his wrath.
[time=1005] Nevertheless, he looked upon them in their distress when he heard their cry.
[time=1011] For their sake, he remembered his covenant and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
[time=1019] And God raised up judges in the land to deliver them from those who had plundered them, but Israel did not listen to their judges.
[time=1030] They played the harlot after other gods, bowing themselves down before them.
[time=1039] Then all of the elders of Israel gathered together and they came to Samuel at Rama and said, "A point a king for us to judge us "that we may be like all the nations." The Lord came to Samuel and said, "Listen to the voice of the people "in regard to all that they say to you.
[time=1061] "For they have not rejected you, Samuel.
[time=1064] "They have rejected me from being king over them." Nevertheless, the people refused to listen to Samuel and said, "No, but there shall be a king over us "that we also may be like all the nations "that our king may judge us "and go out before us and fight our battles." And the Lord said to Jeremiah in the days of Josiah the king, "Have you seen what faithless Israel did?"
[time=1097] She climbed up on every high hill and went under every green tree and she was a harlot there.
[time=1104] And I thought, well, surely after she has done all these things, she will return to me, but she did not return.
[time=1112] Her spirit of harlotry has led them astray.
[time=1118] She has polluted the land and committed adultery with stones and trees.
[time=1124] Her deeds will not allow them to return to the Lord for a spirit of harlotry is within them and they do not know the Lord.
[time=1132] What then?
[time=1135] Are we better than they?
[time=1138] Not at all.
[time=1141] For we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin.
[time=1147] As it is written, none is righteous, not even one.
[time=1153] No one understands.
[time=1155] No one seeks after God.
[time=1157] They have all turned aside and together they have become worthless.
[time=1161] No one does good, not even one.
[time=1165] This rote is an open grave.
[time=1170] They use their tongues for deceit.
[time=1172] Venom is under their lips.
[time=1175] Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.
[time=1179] In their paths are ruin and misery.
[time=1182] The way of peace they have not known.
[time=1184] There is no fear of God before their eyes.
[time=1188] For all have sinned and full short of the glory of God.
[time=1194] Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord.
[time=1202] When I will make a new covenant with the House of Israel and the House of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers.
[time=1209] When on that day I took them by the hand to bring them out of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband.
[time=1215] This is the new covenant that I will make with the House of Israel after those days declares the Lord.
[time=1222] I will put my law within them and I will write it on their hearts and I shall be their God and they shall be my people and they will all know me from the least to the greatest declares the Lord.
[time=1235] For I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more.
[time=1240] Therefore, say to the House of Israel, thus says the Lord.
[time=1245] It is not for your sake, a House of Israel that I'm about to act.
[time=1250] But for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came and I will vindicate the holiness of my great name,
[time=1261] which has been profaned among the nations in which you have profaned among them.
[time=1265] The nations will know that I am the Lord, declares the Lord God went through you.
[time=1273] I vindicate my holiness before their eyes.
[time=1276] I will take you from the nations and I will gather you from the countries and I will bring you into your own land and I will sprinkle clean water on you and you shall be clean from all your uncleanness.
[time=1294] And from all your idols, I will cleanse you and I will give you a new heart.
[time=1300] And a new spirit I will put within you.
[time=1302] I will take your heart of stone and I will give you a heart, a flesh.
[time=1309] And I will put my spirit within you to cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.
[time=1320] For I am the Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression in sin.
[time=1338] Where the law came in, transgression did increase.
[time=1343] But where sin increased, grace abounded all the more so that even as sin reigned in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[time=1359] Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign.
[time=1363] Behold, a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a son.
[time=1368] He will be called manuel and he will save the people from their sins.
[time=1374] And the government will be upon his shoulders and he will be called wonderful counselor, mighty God, everlasting father, Prince of peace.
[time=1387] God, after he had spoken to the fathers in the prophets in many forms and in many ways, in these last days, he has spoken to us in his son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he also made the world.
[time=1406] He is the radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his nature.
[time=1414] He upholds all things by the word of his power.
[time=1418] And after he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand, have the majesty on high.
[time=1424] In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God.
[time=1432] He was in the beginning with God, and all things came into being through him.
[time=1438] In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
[time=1442] The word became flesh and twelfth among us.
[time=1447] And we have seen his glory, the glory as of the only begotten full of grace and truth.
[time=1454] But the light has come into the world, and men have loved the darkness rather than their light, for their deeds were evil.
[time=1467] For anyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.
[time=1473] For he grew up before him, like a young plant,
[time=1480] like a roof out of dry ground.
[time=1482] He had no form or majesty that we should look at him, no beauty that he should be desired.
[time=1490] He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows acquainted with grief.
[time=1497] And as one from whom men hide their faces,
[time=1503] he was despised and we esteemed him not.
[time=1506] Surely he has borne our grief and carried our sorrows.
[time=1513] Yet we esteemed him, stricken, smitten by God and afflicted.
[time=1519] Yet he was wounded for our transgressions.
[time=1524] He was crushed for our iniquities.
[time=1527] Upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and by his stripes we are healed.
[time=1532] All we like sheep have gone astray.
[time=1536] We have turned everyone to his own way, and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[time=1545] He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth, like a lamb that has led to the slaughter, and like a sheep before its shearers is silent, he opened not his mouth.
[time=1560] As for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living and stricken for the transgression of my people?
[time=1574] And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death.
[time=1582] Although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit found in his mouth, yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him.
[time=1590] He has put him to grief.
[time=1593] When his soul makes an offering for guilt, he shall see his offspring and shall prolong his days.
[time=1600] The will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand, and out of the anguish of his soul, he shall see and be satisfied.
[time=1609] By his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquity.
[time=1619] Therefore, I will divide him a portion among the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the many, for he poured out his soul to death, and was numbered among the transgressors, yet he bore this in a many and made intercession for the transgressor.
[time=1639] Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.
[time=1646] Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth and the life.
[time=1656] "No one comes to the Father but for me, "so come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, "and I will give you rest.
[time=1666] "Take my yoke upon you, for I am gentle, "and humble and hard, and you will find rest for your souls.
[time=1675] "For my yoke is easy in my burden, light.
[time=1678] "Why do you spend money for what is not bread, "and your wages for what is not satisfying?
[time=1686] "Listen, carefully to me.
[time=1688] "Eat what is good, and delight yourself in abundance."
[time=1694] He said, "I came that they may have life, "and have it abundantly, so whoever has the Son has life, "but whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
[time=1706] "For you were dead in your trespasses and sins, "and were by nature children of wrath, "like the rest of mankind.
[time=1714] "But God, being rich and mercy, "because of the great love with which he has loved us, "while we were still dead in our trespasses, "he made us alive together with Christ.
[time=1728] "By grace you have been saved.
[time=1731] "While we were still helpless, "at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
[time=1738] "For God who said, let light shine out of darkness "is the one who has shown in our hearts "to give us the light of the knowledge "of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
[time=1753] "Just as he chose us in him "before the foundation of the world "to be holy and blameless before him.
[time=1760] "In love, he predestined us to adoption as sons "through Jesus Christ to himself, "according to the kind intention of his will "and to the praise of the glory of his grace.
[time=1771] "Those whom he foreknew, "he also predestined to become conformed "to the image of his son, "and these whom he predestined.
[time=1782] "He also called.
[time=1783] "And these whom he called he also justified.
[time=1786] "And these whom he justified he also glorified.
[time=1789] "For we were buried with him by baptism into death.
[time=1794] "In order that just as Christ died "and was raised by the glory of the Father, "we too might walk in newness of life.
[time=1802] "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, "he is a new creation.
[time=1806] "The old has passed away, behold, the new has come.
[time=1810] "For the love of Christ controls us.
[time=1814] "And we have concluded this, that one died for all.
[time=1818] "Therefore, all have died.
[time=1820] "And he died for all, "so that those who live might no longer live for themselves.
[time=1825] "But for him who died and was raised, "and all of this is from God, "who through Christ reconciled us to himself.
[time=1837] "And has given us the ministry of reconciliation.
[time=1840] "Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ.
[time=1846] "Go, go therefore.
[time=1848] "And make disciples of all nations, "because Christ was slain and purchased for God "with his bloodmen from every tribe "and tongue, people and nation.
[time=1861] "And love the Lord your God with all your heart, "all your soul and all your mind, "but do not love the world.
[time=1867] "The things in the world.
[time=1869] "For whoever loves the world, "the love of the Father is not in him.
[time=1873] "Do not be surprised, brothers, "that the world hates you.
[time=1878] "For Jesus said, you will be hated by all because of me.
[time=1882] "But it is the one who endures to the end that will be saved.
[time=1885] "For a disciple is not above his teacher, "nor a slave above his master.
[time=1892] "So do not fear the one who is able to kill the body, "but is unable to kill the soul.
[time=1899] "But rather fear him who is able to destroy "both body and soul and hell.
[time=1904] "Whoever confesses me before men, "I will confess him also before my Father who is in heaven.
[time=1920] "Whoever wishes to save his life will lose it.
[time=1923] "But whoever loses his life for my sake, "it is he who will be saved.
[time=1927] "Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake.
[time=1932] "For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1935] "And blessed are you when others revile you, "and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil "against you, false on my account.
[time=1944] "A choice and be glad for great is your reward in heaven.
[time=1951] "Indeed, anyone who desires to live a God in life "in Jesus Christ will be persecuted.
[time=1959] "So suffer hardship with me, "like a good soldier in Jesus Christ.
[time=1964] "For this reason I endure all things, "for the sake of those who have been chosen, "that they too might attain salvation "and whiz it eternal glory.
[time=1974] "Fist light and momentary affliction
[time=1980] "is preparing for us an eternal way "that is beyond all comparison "as we look not to the things that are seen, "but to the things that are unseen, "for the things that are seen are transient.
[time=1997] "The things that are unseen are eternal.
[time=2000] "And after you have suffered a little while,
[time=2008] "the God of all grace, "who has called you into his eternal glory, "will himself restore, restore, "confirm, shrink of him and establish you.
[time=2020] "So we exalt in hope of the glory of God.
[time=2025] "Not only this, we exalt in our tribulations, "knowing that tribulation rings about perseverance, "and perseverance, proving character, "and proving character hope, "and hope does not disappoint.
[time=2040] "For the love of God has been poured out in our hearts "through the Holy Spirit has been given to us.
[time=2046] "Therefore, prepare your minds for action.
[time=2051] "Keep sober in spirit and fix your hope completely "on the grace that is to be brought to you "at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[time=2060] "But know this.
[time=2064] "But if the master of the house had known "in what part of the night with Eve was coming, "he would have stayed awake, "and he would not have let his house be broken into.
[time=2074] "Therefore, you also must be ready "for the Son of Man is coming at an hour "you do not expect.
[time=2081] "Who then is the faithful, "and why servant whom the master has said over his household?
[time=2088] "Blessed is that servant "whom the master will find so doing when he comes.
[time=2095] "Truly, I tell you, "he will set him over all his possessions.
[time=2098] "But if the wicked servant says to himself, "my master is delayed, "and begins beating his fellow servants "and eats and drinks with drunkards, "the master of that servant will come on a day
[time=2118] "he does not expect, "and at an hour he does not know.
[time=2123] "And he will cut him into pieces, "and he will put him with the hypocrites.
[time=2129] "And in that place there will be weeping "and gnashing of teeth.
[time=2133] "And the Lord will descend from heaven
[time=2139] "with the cry of command, "with the voice of an archangel "and the sound of the trumpet of God.
[time=2147] "And then John saw heaven open, "and behold, a white horse.
[time=2154] "And the one sitting on it is called faithful and true.
[time=2159] "In righteousness he judges and makes war.
[time=2162] "His eyes are like a flame of fire.
[time=2166] "On his head are many diadems, "and he has a name written that no one knows but himself.
[time=2172] "His robe is dipped in blood, "and the name by which he is called is the word of God.
[time=2181] "The armies of heaven are arrayed and fine, "lin and white and pure, "and they are following him on white horses.
[time=2189] "From his mouth comes a sharp sword, "with which to strike down the nations, "and he will rule them with a rod of iron, "and he will tread the winepress "of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.
[time=2202] "And on his robe, and on his thigh, "he has a name written, King of Kings, "and Lord of Lords.
[time=2214] "And they will make war on the Lamb.
[time=2216] "The Lamb will conquer them, "for he is the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings, "and those with him are chosen and called and faithful, "and the devil himself was thrown into the lake of fire, "and death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire, "and if anyone's name, not found in the Lamb's book of life, "he was thrown into the lake of fire.
[time=2238] "Then he saw a new heaven and a new earth, "and a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, "and he shall dwell among them, "and they shall be his people, "and God himself will be among men.
[time=2256] "Then he said, "Behold, high in making all things new."
[time=2263] And then he said, "I will wipe away every tear "from their eyes, and there will no longer be any death.
[time=2271] "There will no longer be any mourning or crying or pain.
[time=2274] "The first things have passed away." And he said, "Right, for these words are faithful and true."
[time=2282] And then he said, "It is done.
[time=2285] "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.
[time=2290] "I will give to the one who thirst "from the spring of the water of life without cost.

[time=2467] (audience applauding)
[time=2475] [AMEN] Let me just as we come to, in these next moments, as we come to what is a privilege for us, the remembering of the sacrifice of Christ, as we come to a time of communion this morning here as a family.
[time=2494] I wanna just take all that you just heard and all that we just experienced.
[time=2498] Let me just take a few minutes here and just remind you of some basic biblical truth that just leads us, I think, to an even greater, deeper appreciation for what we're about to participate in, so much of what you just heard, you know, so much of that, all of that is really his redemptive story.
[time=2520] I wanna just pull out a few things here this morning.
[time=2522] And as you and I, those of us in the room who know, who have fully surrendered our hearts and lives to Christ, as we come to this table, I want you to have these truths in mind.
[time=2534] You can write these down, you can commit these to memory.
[time=2536] God created number one, God created.
[time=2539] We saw his creative power here and what we just experienced.
[time=2543] God created in order to relate and display.
[time=2548] I want you to remember this this morning.
[time=2550] God created in order to relate and display, relate to man.
[time=2557] He created in order to relate to man and to display his creation.
[time=2563] What do we mean by relate to man?
[time=2566] He created man, I hope you know this.
[time=2569] Our God, the God of this universe, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the great superior and magnificent God, he created man to walk with him.
[time=2581] He created man to be in relationship with man.
[time=2586] Go back to the beginning if you would.
[time=2587] Go back to Genesis chapter three.
[time=2589] We've seen this before.
[time=2590] I wanna remind you of this this morning.
[time=2593] Look at the relationship between God and man.
[time=2598] This is what God had in mind.
[time=2600] This is what God intended.
[time=2602] This is what God designed.
[time=2604] He loved man so much he creates him and desires to be close to him.
[time=2611] Says in verse eight, Genesis chapter three, they heard the sound, they knew him so well, they knew his sound.
[time=2618] They heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day.
[time=2626] And the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden and the Lord called to the man and said to him, where are you?
[time=2636] Where are you?
[time=2637] He said, I heard the sound of you in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid myself.
[time=2647] They were so close to him.
[time=2651] He was so close to them.
[time=2653] We see here as we look into these two, three verses, we see the pattern of their relationship.
[time=2659] We see the kind of walk that they experienced, a closeness that led them to a familiarity, a walking in the garden in the cool of the day.
[time=2671] This is the kind of relationship he has with them.
[time=2674] God created man because he wanted to be with him.
[time=2678] Do you understand that?
[time=2678] God doesn't want to be distant from you.
[time=2680] God doesn't want to be a far off God.
[time=2682] No, he is a God who designed, he creates man with this desire to be close to man.
[time=2689] Adam and Eve, Israel, the church,
[time=2696] God has always wanted to have his people.
[time=2699] I shall remember, I shall be your God and you shall be my, what, my people.
[time=2706] And I love how it says and you shall be my possession.
[time=2710] Again, a word that carries with it the great picture of intimacy.
[time=2714] You shall be my possession, you shall be my people.
[time=2718] And it's not just God the Father who has this heart for people, it's not just God the Father who wanted to be close and with.
[time=2725] If you flip over to Matthew, look at the words of Jesus himself.
[time=2730] Matthew, go to Matthew 23.
[time=2732] It says in Matthew 23, 37, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jesus cries out.
[time=2740] Jerusalem who kills the prophets and stones, those who are sent to her, Matthew 23, 37.
[time=2747] How often I wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings.
[time=2756] And you were unwilling.
[time=2759] Jesus himself displaying the very heart of God, this deep, intimate, personal love for people and this desire to be with God creates man in order to relate God creates the earth.
[time=2776] God creates the earth in order to display his magnificent glory, his greatness.
[time=2783] He creates the earth to display his majesty, to say to his people in essence, look what I did.
[time=2790] As you live with me, point the nations toward me, the creator of all of this.
[time=2797] He creates the earth and all that is in it as a way to communicate to an on-looking world, to the nations, to the peoples, his greatness and his glory and his majesty.
[time=2810] Look at Romans 1.20, it says it right there for sense the creation of the world.
[time=2818] His invisible attributes, his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen.
[time=2824] Do you understand this?
[time=2827] Being understood through what has been made, this is general revelation for all of the people and all of the world and all of the nations for all of time, being understood through what has been made so that they are without excuse.
[time=2846] God creates in order to relate to man
[time=2852] and display his greatness and his glory through his creation.
[time=2858] But tragically, as the book and as Tanya
[time=2864] so eloquently and powerfully communicated, man has always resisted God's design.
[time=2872] Write that down.
[time=2873] Man has always resisted God's design.
[time=2878] As for relationship, remember we said, God created man for relationship with him.
[time=2884] As for relationship from day one, from Genesis three, from that encounter in the garden, man has looked everywhere else other than God.
[time=2894] Man has gone to everyone else other than God, looking for that connection with everything else other than God.
[time=2909] Instead of pointing people to worship the Creator, we've worshiped the creation.
[time=2917] As it relates to relationship, we've gone everywhere else we can think of.
[time=2921] As it relates to worshiping the Creator, we've instead worshiped the creation.
[time=2927] Romans tells us about this as well.
[time=2930] Romans one, just pick it up in that next verse, verse 21, for even though they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations and their foolish heart was darkened.
[time=2945] Professing to be wise, they became fools.
[time=2948] And what did we do?
[time=2951] The text there in verse 23 says that we exchanged.
[time=2956] It's the word that means trade, we've traded God.
[time=2961] Can you imagine?
[time=2963] They've exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.
[time=2977] One author said we'll trade God for a condo
[time=2983] in 20 seconds of pleasure.
[time=2985] And that's exactly what this text tells us right here.
[time=2993] Adam, Eve, the Jews, Israel, us, think about it.
[time=2998] Eve worships, Eve follows the serpent.
[time=3004] What did it say there in Romans 123 crawling creatures?
[time=3009] Eve follows and worships the serpent.
[time=3014] Israel, I'm reminded of Exodus 32, where the people grow weary of waiting and they throw all their gold together and they build a golden what?
[time=3028] Say it louder, a four-footed animal, Israel worships and follows the golden calf.
[time=3036] You and me, you and me, we worship celebrity.
[time=3041] You and me, we worship wealth, pleasure, status.
[time=3049] What did the text say?
[time=3050] Corruptible man, corruptible man.
[time=3055] Well, man's constant resistance to God's design results in two things.
[time=3062] I want you to just hang on to these things this morning as we come to the table today as a family.
[time=3068] Two things result from man's resistance to God's design.
[time=3072] Number one is death.
[time=3074] I wanna just remind you of this this morning.
[time=3077] I think on this, my friends, death is the number one result of man's ongoing resistance to God's design.
[time=3085] Death, a sinfulness that separates.
[time=3088] Let's just think about that for a moment.
[time=3090] What did God say?
[time=3091] You heard Tonya mention it at the beginning.
[time=3093] What did God say to Eve?
[time=3094] The day you eat of it, you surely will what?
[time=3099] He introduces this from the very beginning, that disobedience and separated from him means one thing and that is what, say it, death.
[time=3109] Look at Romans 5, 12.
[time=3110] Romans 5, we see this all throughout the gospels.
[time=3115] We see it all throughout the epistles.
[time=3117] You see it all throughout the scriptures.
[time=3118] Romans 5, 12, therefore just as through one man, Adam, Eve, sin entered into the world and death through sin and so death spread to all men
[time=3133] because all have what, say it, sinned.
[time=3136] Romans 6, 23, most of you in the room know this for others of you, it may be a new truth for the wages, wages, what you earn, what you get for the wages of sin is what?
[time=3149] Is death and Tonya quoted from Ephesians 2 and you were dead in your trespasses and sin.
[time=3157] Your sin, my trespasses, our iniquity, minus God left us dead, not sort of dead, not kind of dead, dead.
[time=3172] This is the condition of man.
[time=3175] This is the number one result of man continuing to resist God's design.
[time=3182] Not only are we left dead, but also and obviously so, we are left in need with a need for a solution, a savior, a savior who would redeem.
[time=3196] John 3, 16, I wanna draw your attention to a great phrase in the middle of this often quoted verse and I wanna just allow you to bask and rejoice in the great truth of this in light of the reality of death for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son
[time=3215] that whoever believes in him say this out loud with me, shall not perish.
[time=3222] I wanna just remind you of that this morning as we come to the table.
[time=3229] You, those of you who know him, listen, 'cause I don't think we say this right.
[time=3236] I think we say this wrong, you're not going to perish.
[time=3245] There is no death.
[time=3246] To be absent from the body is to beware.
[time=3252] To be present with the Lord, you shall not die.
[time=3257] Physically, you'll die.
[time=3260] Sure, your heart, my heart's can stop beating one day.
[time=3264] But understand that in the great or more important reality, the scripture is so clear that in light of death and its consequence and all that comes with sin because of Jesus Christ and because of God's redemptive love and this story, this history that we've seen today, you shall not perish ever.
[time=3284] Ephesians two, this was quoted as well.
[time=3290] One of my favorite passages of all time.
[time=3294] Turning your Bibles, look at Ephesians chapter two,
[time=3301] two, one, we were dead and our trespasses in which we used to walk according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit of the sons of disobedience, verse three, among them two, we all used to live in the lusts of our flesh indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind.
[time=3317] We were by nature, children of wrath, but God.
[time=3322] Verse four, but God being rich in mercy
[time=3328] because of his great love with which he loved us, even when we were what, there it is, dead in our transgressions, say this out loud church, made us alive, made us alive together with who?
[time=3342] Say his name, say it again.
[time=3346] Romans seven, oh wretched man that I am.
[time=3349] Never forget the first time I ever heard this.
[time=3352] 1983, 20 years old as lost as lost could be.
[time=3358] And I heard the preacher say, quoting from Romans seven, oh wretched man that I am, who will say who in the world is gonna save me from this body of death?
[time=3370] Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=3375] And that is the name that we lift up this morning.
[time=3380] That is the name that we pay honor to today.
[time=3383] Christ, the beginning and the end in God's history, God's story of redemption.
[time=3390] Christ our substitute for the punishment we deserved.
[time=3394] Christ is who we come to the table this morning to remember.
[time=3399] And if you know him, if you have bowed the knee of your heart and fully surrendered yourself to him, then this is for you.
[time=3408] And if you haven't, and I know there are those in the room,
[time=3415] I have the privilege.
[time=3416] And you know I mean that, the privilege of knowing you.
[time=3419] And there are many of you still thinking this through.
[time=3424] And I wonder what a better day, what a better setting, what a better time for you to bow the knee of your heart, to say to God in your own words in your own heart this morning, oh God, my sin has separated me from you.
[time=3441] Oh God, I know that I am dead without you.
[time=3444] Oh God, thank you for the sacrifice of your son.
[time=3448] God your willingness to part with him, to send him to die and to defeat death on my behalf.
[time=3453] For you to be able to say, oh God, I submit myself to you and to follow in your son from this day forward and in saying that to confess with your mouth and believe in your heart.
[time=3466] It says you will be what?
[time=3469] Saved.
[time=3472] So maybe this morning right here in these moments, he's saving you.
[time=3478] If you're admitting, if you're proclaiming, if you're saying these things to him, would love for that to be the case if we can help you with that.
[time=3488] We would love nothing more than to be able to do that.
[time=3491] (upbeat music)
