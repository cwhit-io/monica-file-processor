[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It's great to be with you and I'm so thankful that my good friend Rod Ovid is here with me again.
[time=39] Rod, as you may know by now, some of you may not.
[time=42] Rod and his wife Carolyn are the founders of the Logos Institute of Biblical Studies.
[time=48] Logos is an amazing opportunity that we at Blackhawk are so thrilled to be kind of a part of.
[time=54] I have the privilege of serving as chairman of their board and also just as their good friend.
[time=60] And Logos is all about getting the word of God, the truth of God, the scriptures, great doctrine, life changing stuff into the hands of everyday people through reasonably, really reasonably priced classes.
[time=76] There's opportunities all over the region.
[time=79] You can go online and learn more about the bigger picture.
[time=82] Today though, we wanna catch you up on a great new development that I'm really, really excited about.
[time=88] I want you to hear about this and I want you to go and look and see if maybe it might be something that you or those that you know in this area may wanna be a part of.
[time=98] Something great going on in Decatur.
[time=100] In the Decatur region, gosh Rod, it could be Van Wert, could be Bluffton.
[time=106] - Burn.
[time=107] - Monroeville.
[time=108] - Monroeville, ASEAN.
[time=110] Tell what's going on.
[time=111] - Yeah, it's an exciting opportunity.
[time=113] We're opening up the Decatur Regional Campus and it's fantastic.
[time=118] This has come together recently.
[time=122] We have about 20 churches we've been meeting with down there in Decatur and it's their ministerial board and they are pumped.
[time=130] I mean, there's all these various denominations and they put their heads together.
[time=135] They found us a neutral location.
[time=137] - Wow.
[time=138] - One gentleman down there, two gentlemen, they've offered us a banquet facility, part of a bowling alley of all things.
[time=146] - Wow.
[time=147] Bible classes at the bowling alley.
[time=148] - That's right.
[time=149] We really struck it rich, so to speak.
[time=151] No, anyway, it went on with about 10 minutes of bowling jokes.
[time=155] But anyway, it was really, really great.
[time=159] It's a 1500 square foot room, beautifully facilitated and it's going to be great and we'll have it every Monday night.
[time=167] Every Monday that we have class will be there in Decatur.
[time=170] It's right on Nutment Avenue, right near 27.
[time=175] It's easily located.
[time=178] Villa Lane's, everyone knows where it's at.
[time=180] And we'll be at the east end of the building.
[time=182] - Fantastic.
[time=183] - And to have our own entrance, it's great.
[time=185] And we'll be starting off for the first five weeks.
[time=187] We start April 9th.
[time=188] The first five weeks, we're going to have an intro to theology for both the six and the 730 class.
[time=194] And then on May 21st, we'll start New Testament survey from six to 730.
[time=200] 730 to nine will be Old Testament survey.
[time=202] By the way, Kelly, repeat after me.
[time=205] - Yes.
[time=206] - My name is Kelly Bird.
[time=208] - And I'm a theologian.
[time=210] - That's right.
[time=211] We've been doing that in a lot of classes lately.
[time=213] We have everyone recite that.
[time=214] - That's good.
[time=215] - We're thinking of getting name tags.
[time=216] - So 20 churches coming together to give all of their people a chance to go deeper into the word of God, go deeper into doctrine.
[time=226] - Absolutely.
[time=227] - Again, with Logos, it's not just about going deeper into doctrine.
[time=230] I know these guys.
[time=231] And it's about understanding it so that you can live it out and experience its great blessing in your life.
[time=239] So go to the website.
[time=241] Right here at the bottom of the screen, you'll see the Logos website.
[time=245] Don't forget this is coming up.
[time=246] It starts what date?
[time=248] - April 9th.
[time=248] - April 9th, Monday.
[time=250] It's going to be every Monday night out in the Decatur region.
[time=252] If you know people that live out there or if you live in that region, please go to the website.
[time=258] All the information that Rod just gave you is going to be right there for you to better see and understand.
[time=264] Shoot 'em an email, call 'em.
[time=265] There's contact information there on the website.
[time=268] They'd love to answer any questions.
[time=270] Hey, God bless you.
[time=271] Thanks for tuning in.
[time=272] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=274] [MUSIC - 121 seconds]
[time=398] Verse 10 says so that you may approve the things that are excellent in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ having been filled with the fruit of righteousness.
[time=411] A righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.
[time=417] The word of God says in Philippians two, verses 12 and 13, so then beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation.
[time=433] Work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who is at work.
[time=441] In you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
[time=447] Our Father in Heaven as we come this morning to your word, as we are privileged again, to be able to be in your presence as a family.
[time=457] Oh God, may the word that you've given us today, here in the book of Philippians, may it speak to us, may it pour down like rain, may it wash us, may it convict us, may it answer questions that we've needed, answered God, may it raise new ones, that we need to ask.
[time=476] Oh God, may we come to this moment with humility, may we come with a sense of wanting to learn and to grow.
[time=484] May you and your word and your spirit do its perfect work in us, for it's in your son's name that we pray.
[time=492] And everybody who agreed and said, amen, you can have a seat.
[time=496] Thank you, Corbin.
[time=499] Now as we come back to our study of the book of Philippians, Paul's Letter to the Church at Philippi, we find ourselves at chapter three.
[time=508] Would you turn there, Philippians chapter three?
[time=511] And what we're gonna see, I read that to you on purpose this morning, that whole thing about you and I working out our faith and God working out our faith.
[time=520] We're gonna come this morning at chapter three and we're gonna see Paul lay out for us.
[time=524] Listen, it's gonna lay out for you a workout plan.
[time=527] It's gonna lay out for you a working it out plan,
[time=533] if you will, a spiritual growth P90X, my friends,
[time=539] designed by God, embraced by Paul to help the Philippians and you.
[time=545] Listen, to help them, but to help you this morning.
[time=548] If in fact you're interested in getting stronger, if in fact you're interested in getting spiritually more durable, if in fact you're wanting to experience a foundation strengthening, establishing process where your salvation is grown.
[time=567] Do you want that?
[time=568] I appreciate that.
[time=571] Anybody else want that?
[time=573] And I'm asking you for a reason.
[time=574] All right, I'm asking you for a reason.
[time=577] 'Cause you may not.
[time=578] And I'm asking you because there's nothing more pitiful.
[time=583] There's nothing more embarrassing.
[time=585] Believe me, I've been there, you've been there.
[time=587] There's nothing worse than someone saying they wanna get stronger, saying they wanna work out plan, being given a workout plan and then they what?
[time=597] They don't do it and they don't do it because you know what?
[time=600] You can give me all the excuses.
[time=603] I can give you all of mine.
[time=604] The fact is you don't want it.
[time=606] As much as you want some other things.
[time=610] And so I'm asking you this morning, I mean it.
[time=613] Do you want this?
[time=615] Do you wanna see what Paul has for us in chapter three as it relates to a plan that you and I can give ourselves to that will grow us in the strength and the durability and the establishment of our faith.
[time=630] You know, I've been learning a bit these days about the correlation between physically working out and spiritual exercise and the balance between our part, the role we play and the part, the role that God plays over the last couple of years or so.
[time=648] The alarm's been going off next to my bed pretty early, a lot earlier than it used to.
[time=654] And I've been trying to drag my aging 49-year-old body over to Spiece where my dear friend Becky Levi, director of Spiece Sports Performance and head trainer there at Spiece.
[time=669] She's really a strength and conditioning expert.
[time=672] She's a godly woman, a dear friend of Cabra and I and our kids and a wonderful gal, very kind and sweet when she's not at Spiece.
[time=683] (audience laughs) And she was here first hour and I said that to her face.
[time=687] I want you to know that.
[time=688] You get her inside Spiece back in the back there where she works us out and oh my gosh, she just becomes evil I think at times.
[time=696] (audience laughs) But that's just how she rolls.
[time=700] She's been working with me at times giving me direct hands-on instruction, working me out.
[time=708] And I want you just to listen here as I talk about this, just for a couple of minutes.
[time=713] I'm trying to kind of make sense in my own mind and maybe I'm trying to help you make sense of this balance between the role we play and the role God plays and how this interaction between him and you and me, how this works.
[time=728] She's been working me out along with high amounts of verbal feedback, words of encouragement at times like that was decent.
[time=740] She'll say to me, that's encouragement.
[time=743] Words of admonishment at times like that was horrible.
[time=747] Do that again.
[time=748] She's been working with me.
[time=752] I've been trying to work with her.
[time=754] She has on the God front in this analogy, she's kind of like God.
[time=759] I know she was uncomfortable hearing me say that this morning but just for the illustration sake, think about it.
[time=764] She's taught me so much.
[time=766] She plucked me out of the 40s.
[time=768] And by 40s I don't mean age.
[time=772] I'm here to tell you that when I was 30, I swore, I made an oath.
[time=776] I said to anybody who would listen to me, I would never wear size 40 waist pants.
[time=783] Ever, not gonna go there.
[time=785] Well, I went there and I stayed there and I traveled down that road even further and thank God, Becky comes along, she plucks me back out of the 40s.
[time=796] Listen, she educates me, she works with me, she pushes me, she helped me grow, set new goals, expand my knowledge of the process.
[time=807] She did incredible amounts of work with me.
[time=810] And then months and months and months down the road, she slowly started to let me go.
[time=816] I'd work out on my own.
[time=818] She'd have other clients to work with and so then the day came when I'd show up and now it was up to me to work out my commitment.
[time=830] To do the things that I had said I wanted to do and I just killed it.
[time=836] You would have been so proud of me.
[time=837] Total focus, absolutely dialed in.
[time=840] Nothing could get in my way.
[time=842] I was a machine, I was an animal.
[time=844] I wouldn't even set my alarm in the morning.
[time=847] I was just so excited and so ready to get there.
[time=850] New dry fit shirts and new shorts and I was set to geek.
[time=855] People probably laughed at me, but I didn't care because I was on track and doing my thing.
[time=860] It was amazing for about two weeks.
[time=864] (audience laughs) And then I'd stay in bed a little longer.
[time=871] You with me?
[time=872] Feeling my pain, aren't you?
[time=873] Then I'd cut the work out a little bit shorter
[time=879] 'cause I'm on my own now.
[time=880] And then you'd know I was really struggling and anybody who's been to speech knows these guys.
[time=887] I became one of them.
[time=889] You'd know I was really struggling when I'd start watching the TVs.
[time=893] They got these darn TVs everywhere.
[time=895] And when I was focused, I didn't see 'em but then see that I wasn't focused.
[time=898] So then you'd see me leaning up against the machines, watching the early morning sports center with a shake in my hand.
[time=904] It was pitiful.
[time=905] So then I'd get back with Becky, confess my waywardness.
[time=908] Oh, Becky, please forgive me.
[time=909] And listen, she would always point me back to the plan.
[time=914] She would always point me back to the routine.
[time=916] Her routine, she had uniquely designed for me.
[time=919] And if I would be faithful and focused and diligent with it, I would grow.
[time=924] In this case, I would shrink.
[time=926] I would get stronger.
[time=929] It's the same thing with God and you this morning, my friends, there is a workout plan.
[time=934] There is an approach to spiritual formation and spiritual growth in your life.
[time=941] Given you right here, Philippians 3, some tremendous principles that I want you to hold onto that can help strengthen and solidify your spiritual heart and soul.
[time=953] Do you want this?
[time=953] Yes or no?
[time=955] All right, good.
[time=957] Philippians 3, Paul's workout plan.
[time=959] Here we go, number one, don't dread it, smile.
[time=962] Don't dread it, smile as you roll out each day.
[time=967] I can talk to you about my physical routine at space.
[time=971] As you and I roll out into our spiritual development routines as we begin to spend time with him on a personal basis, more faithfully and more consistently, as we make a commitment to come into this place, a big commitment to gather with the family of God, as we connect with smaller settings than this and give ourselves to a small group or a Sunday morning, ABF, as you and I make personal commitments to serve each week in different settings, as we sit down and write our check and give and serve through our game, as we give ourselves to these things, this endeavor, this process.
[time=1011] It's amazing to me how many people I bump into on the spiritual front as it relates to all those things and you'd think it was drudgery.
[time=1021] It's like it's painful.
[time=1024] It's like me rolling into space at 5.30 or 6.30.
[time=1028] It's amazing watching people walk through those doors to come and work out and be healthy.
[time=1032] They're angry.
[time=1034] It's like they're bitter.
[time=1035] It's like they're upset.
[time=1036] It's like they started out on the wrong foot.
[time=1038] Real quick attitude on this front.
[time=1041] Look what he says, verse one.
[time=1042] So then Philippians three, finally my brethren, what's it say, church?
[time=1047] Say it out loud.
[time=1048] Say it like you're rejoicing louder.
[time=1051] Say it again.
[time=1052] Rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1055] Finally my brethren, rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1057] Don't get negative.
[time=1058] Don't be pessimistic.
[time=1060] The workout's gonna be grueling at times.
[time=1062] It's gonna push you and stretch you literally.
[time=1065] Yes, it'll hurt.
[time=1065] Yes, it'll test your resolve.
[time=1067] But here's what the first line of verse one is saying, Spirit's up.
[time=1071] Spirit's up.
[time=1073] It's okay.
[time=1074] You've got him.
[time=1075] You're with him.
[time=1076] The Lord's got your back.
[time=1078] Literally what it says is be joyful.
[time=1080] You're in the Lord.
[time=1083] On this journey that you begin.
[time=1087] On this spiritual discipline path that you and I walk as we give ourselves to growing, rejoice.
[time=1094] It's a good thing.
[time=1095] It may be tough, but you're in literally with him.
[time=1100] He's working out back to the tension and the dynamic.
[time=1105] He's working out with you.
[time=1108] You're with him.
[time=1109] He's with you.
[time=1110] Can't tell you how many times I'm laying there on the bench press back there with Becky.
[time=1117] I'm bench pressing and she's telling me how many times I've got to do this certain way.
[time=1124] Can't tell you how many times.
[time=1125] I know I'm supposed to do 10.
[time=1127] I get to six and I'm done.
[time=1128] I know I'm done.
[time=1129] I have nothing left.
[time=1130] I couldn't lift it if you paid me a million bucks.
[time=1133] And there she is.
[time=1133] Go, go.
[time=1135] And I start to go and all of a sudden I can do it.
[time=1138] And I start to think, wow, I can really do this.
[time=1141] And I do number seven.
[time=1142] And I come down and eights a little bit harder, but I do it.
[time=1145] And then I'm going to do nine because now I'm the man.
[time=1147] I didn't think I could do seven or eight, but now I can't so watch out world.
[time=1151] So here comes nine and boom.
[time=1152] And as I'm coming up, I see she's got her hand on the thing.
[time=1156] (audience laughs) She's just reaching down.
[time=1159] She's just spotting me.
[time=1160] She's just got her hand gently under the bar.
[time=1162] I'm spitting and grunting.
[time=1164] I don't even pick it.
[time=1165] She's got her hand right there and she's just helping eight, nine, 10.
[time=1169] Good job, weakling.
[time=1170] (audience laughs) She's with me.
[time=1175] She's right there when I couldn't.
[time=1180] She could.
[time=1181] And it helped me.
[time=1185] And I knew, I knew it wasn't me, but I did 10.
[time=1190] How did I feel about doing 10?
[time=1192] I made it.
[time=1193] Was it all me?
[time=1194] No, it was a little bit of her.
[time=1196] That's how it goes, my friends.
[time=1198] It's all, it's all him, a little bit of you.
[time=1201] Him and you, you and him.
[time=1203] You just blowing and grunting and spitting into the best you can, no matter how hard it might be.
[time=1207] There he is, hand under the bar.
[time=1211] There's a real great doctrine here, but I just wanna teach you real quick.
[time=1215] We could go on for hours on this, just a couple of minutes.
[time=1218] The doctrine is really, I want you to understand this, your position in Christ.
[time=1223] This verse just touches on it.
[time=1225] Paul reminds them, he reminds you and me both, but literally when we came to faith in Christ, we were transported, you were.
[time=1233] You were transported by virtue of your faith to a completely new and divine sphere of existence.
[time=1240] A place where trial cannot destroy you, where hardship cannot defeat you, no matter what happens to you, you and the Lord are now irrevocably connected and his sovereign loving control over all and his sovereign loving comfort in the midst of any storm allows genuine Christ followers to rejoice.
[time=1264] As you and your faith get worked out, here's the phrase in him.
[time=1270] You are not on your own, you are not by yourself.
[time=1273] You are far from it.
[time=1274] In fact, the scriptures teach us and what a great doctrine it is that you are literally in Christ.
[time=1282] He has enveloped you.
[time=1284] He has surrounded you.
[time=1286] He has consumed you.
[time=1287] You are in him.
[time=1289] And so as you and I get worked out,
[time=1295] you and I make our way.
[time=1297] We are not alone.
[time=1298] He is not distant.
[time=1300] His hands under the bar, rejoice, amen?
[time=1305] Rejoice.
[time=1307] Christ is with you.
[time=1310] The second step to your spiritual workout, repetition reaps rewards.
[time=1316] Will you write that down?
[time=1317] Repetition, my friends, reaps rewards.
[time=1321] What does Paul say about repeating himself?
[time=1324] He says a number of things in a number of different places.
[time=1326] Here's one for you.
[time=1327] Look at the screen in 1 Peter.
[time=1330] Write this down.
[time=1331] It says 1 Peter, you got it up there.
[time=1336] 2 Peter chapter 1.
[time=1337] I consider it right, he says, in his second letter to Peter, I consider it right as long as I am in this earthly dwelling, as long as I'm alive, as long as I'm in this body, I consider it right to stir you up by way of what?
[time=1352] Say the word.
[time=1354] Reminder, reminder.
[time=1357] He says I consider it a good thing in your spiritual development to continually stir you up by way of me saying to you things
[time=1368] that I've already said to you.
[time=1369] And I love how he says it there in chapter three of Philippians.
[time=1374] Finally, my brethren rejoice in the Lord to write the same things again as no trouble to me and it is a safeguard for you.
[time=1383] Now, most of you who know me know this about me.
[time=1387] I'm a firm believer in the huge danger of ruts.
[time=1392] I hate ruts.
[time=1394] I don't like people who are in ruts.
[time=1396] I think ruts are dangerous, ruts are a bad thing if you're in one, climb fast, and get out.
[time=1403] I hate ruts.
[time=1404] And yes, I also believe that God connects with us in new and fresh ways.
[time=1411] I believe that, but I also believe that there is great value in consistently hearing the word of God, sometimes consistently hearing the same word of God again and again and again.
[time=1426] And I also believe that practicing some spiritual disciplines again and again and again is a good thing.
[time=1433] That's not a rut, that's healthy.
[time=1435] If what we're talking about is the word of God, if what we're talking about are spiritual disciplines, it's healthy.
[time=1442] You need, I need those spiritual muscles exercised repeatedly.
[time=1449] Amen?
[time=1451] Back in the back there at Spies when Becky hands me those 40 pound dumbbells.
[time=1455] So I hand me these two 40 pounders and she'll say curl them and press them.
[time=1459] Curl them, you know, I got a curl them.
[time=1462] And then when I'm done curling, I'm gonna stand there and I've gotta press them.
[time=1466] Well, I want you to know, and I'm not bragging, I'm just telling you how painful and hard this is.
[time=1471] I don't curl them twice.
[time=1472] No, you curl them 10 times.
[time=1477] And then you do that three more, you do three sets of 10 curls and three sets of 10 presses.
[time=1485] And by the time that 15 minutes is over, I've done it 60 times.
[time=1490] And by 50, I'm bagging her for mercy.
[time=1494] As if she were God.
[time=1495] Oh, please stop, you know.
[time=1497] I'm on the verge of tears.
[time=1499] Paul says, I've absolutely no problem telling you the same things I've already told you because repetition is good for you.
[time=1511] When I was in seminary, I met an old preacher.
[time=1513] Told us the story of the time he went to one of his first churches and preached the same sermon the first four weeks he was there.
[time=1519] Preached the same sermon the first four weeks he was there, deacons came to him and said, preacher, when are you gonna change your sermon?
[time=1526] He says, listen, I'll give you a new sermon when you guys start applying the first one.
[time=1530] And that's a great point.
[time=1533] Sometimes your kids, sometimes me, sometimes you, sometimes we need to hear some things.
[time=1540] More than once, repetition brings reward.
[time=1545] The text, look at this.
[time=1548] The text also tells you something about repetition.
[time=1551] Look at it, it says, look at the inverse one.
[time=1554] It says, it is a safeguard for you that I would tell you something I've already told you, that I would teach you something I've already taught you, that I would stir you up by way of reminder.
[time=1566] He says it's a safeguard.
[time=1567] If you look that word up, that phrase safeguard, you look it up in the Greek, it means so as not to fail.
[time=1574] You ever been saved by something that you've heard again
[time=1581] and again and again, you ever have something come to mind that you've heard repeatedly and that you heard it repeatedly.
[time=1591] There was just a time where all of a sudden it kicked in at just the right moment and boom.
[time=1600] A choice got made, a decision was made.
[time=1602] When I was 16 and started to leave the house at night,
[time=1610] go do something here or there, you know, go with a buddy.
[time=1614] 17, 18 going out with a girl or whatever.
[time=1617] Every time I leave the house, from the time I was 16 on, my mom would say, remember who you are.
[time=1630] And there were so many nights, you know, I've got to confess, most of you know that about me, from 16 to 20, 16 to 20, where I thoroughly forgot who I was.
[time=1646] But I'll never forget that night in that church in September of 1983.
[time=1653] I've told you the story a lot of times when I came to faith in Christ.
[time=1657] Here it was, you know, almost five years later, and she must have said that to me a hundred times.
[time=1664] And I remember praying that prayer that night in the back row of that church surrendering my heart to God.
[time=1669] And I remember those words coming to my mind.
[time=1672] Now I know who's I am.
[time=1675] Now I'm yours.
[time=1676] She had instilled this in me.
[time=1678] She had just repeatedly said it to me.
[time=1680] And I try and do the same thing with my kids.
[time=1682] I hope you try and do the same thing with yours.
[time=1684] I hope you're trying to develop a culture, a verbiage, a vernacular that reminds them of truth, repetition, saying it again.
[time=1692] Paul says it's a safeguard, so is not to fail.
[time=1696] Success is born out of repeated and disciplined efforts.
[time=1703] I know that there are athletes in the room who think that's an athletic truth.
[time=1708] I know that there are businessmen and women in the room who think that's a corporate truth.
[time=1712] I know there are parents in the room who believe, rightly so, that it's a parenting truth.
[time=1716] I know there are educators in the room who believe it's an educational truth.
[time=1721] You know what that statement is?
[time=1722] It's a biblical truth.
[time=1725] It's just true.
[time=1727] It's true.
[time=1728] Capital T. Success is born out of repeated and disciplined efforts.
[time=1733] Paul knew a little bit about this, my friends.
[time=1735] Take just a minute, Wijian, go back to 1 Corinthians 9.
[time=1738] Would you do that?
[time=1739] Everybody, just turn your Bibles to 1 Corinthians 9?
[time=1744] Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize?
[time=1751] That's how this passage starts out in 24.
[time=1753] Look at 26, Paul here talking about his workouts.
[time=1759] "Therefore I run in such a way as not without aim." No, there's purpose and intent behind his running.
[time=1767] "I run in such a way as not without aim." "My box in such a way as not beating the air, but I discipline my body and make it my slave
[time=1778] so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified."
[time=1786] Running, boxing, disciplining, enslaving.
[time=1791] Success is born out of repeated and disciplined efforts.
[time=1795] There is great reward with repetition.
[time=1799] Do you believe that?
[time=1801] [AMEN] Workout principle number three.
[time=1805] Here you go.
[time=1806] Write this one down, never, ever, ever.
[time=1809] Don't ever trust you.
[time=1817] Go back to our Philippians 3 passage, if we will.
[time=1819] Look at verse two.
[time=1820] Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision, oh, people,
[time=1827] there was a, there was some things going on, there were things going on in the church there at Philippi.
[time=1832] There were things going on in Philippi.
[time=1833] There was a movement afoot with false teaching and false doctrine, Paul calls in dogs.
[time=1840] They were trying to destroy the church.
[time=1843] They were trying to move these dear people away from their faith.
[time=1848] He says, "Be aware, for we are the true circumcision as believers who worship in the Spirit of
[time=1855] God and glory we do in Christ Jesus.
[time=1860] And as we do that, He reminds them and we put no confidence in the flesh."
[time=1868] In this spiritual journey, there is zero confidence put in the flesh.
[time=1875] Now if there was ever somebody who was going to put confidence in the flesh, Paul says it's me.
[time=1880] Although I myself might have confidence even in the flesh, if anyone else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh, I far more circumcise the eighth day of the nation of Israel, of
[time=1892] the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, as to the law of Pharisee, as to zeal a persecutor
[time=1899] of the church, as to the righteousness which is in the law found blameless.
[time=1905] You know what that's telling us?
[time=1906] It's saying that in his culture, in that day prior to Christ, being in his life, in
[time=1912] his culture, in that day, Paul had quite the resume, very accomplished, huge achievements
[time=1919] and status.
[time=1921] He was a really big deal and he says he puts zero confidence in his flesh spiritually.
[time=1935] When you think, and I've watched many of you do this, you've watched me do this at times.
[time=1949] If you get to this point where you really believe you're all you need, when you get to the point
[time=1961] where on the spiritual workout front, on the spiritual progress front, you have the audacity
[time=1970] to look somebody in the eye or even just say it to yourself when you say, "Hey, I got it."
[time=1977] Dude, you're in so much trouble.
[time=1983] You're just about to go down.
[time=1987] You end up leaning against the equipment, watching Good Morning America on the TV, talking
[time=1993] to people with a protein shake in your hand, thinking you're all that, and really you're just making a fool of yourself.
[time=2003] Guess who trusted in themselves?
[time=2007] Think about it with me just for a moment in a few minutes here.
[time=2011] Think about the Bible.
[time=2013] Think about the Scriptures.
[time=2014] A lot of you in the room have had some experience with this book and the stories, the truths that we find in it, all the way through.
[time=2022] Think about some people who said, "I got it, I'm good, I'll walk this alone."
[time=2034] Samson, who was really what?
[time=2040] Really strong.
[time=2041] Think about Samson who got so strong and he got so tough and he had so many victories.
[time=2047] He began to believe the press.
[time=2051] Think about Samson who ended up losing all of his strength dead with his eyes gouged
[time=2059] out under the rubble of the temple that he destroyed in his last act of valor.
[time=2067] Think about David.
[time=2069] Think about King David, a man after God's own heart, yes, who had a very, very sad season
[time=2078] where he sleeps with Bathsheba, has her husband murdered, lies, infant son, dies.
[time=2084] How'd that go?
[time=2086] How was he doing kind of on his own, sending the other generals out to fight while he decided he was going to sit this one out, because after all he had become the man?
[time=2098] Think about Saul who came before David, lost his kingdom due to his pride and his stubbornness, ends up dead, prodigal son, lost his inheritance, squandered it all, lost his dignity, ended
[time=2110] up eating with the pigs.
[time=2112] Think about the foolish man who built his house upon the sand, how'd that go?
[time=2117] Washed away, gone, rich young ruler, tech, seems to say he ended up in hell.
[time=2126] How do you do on your own?
[time=2130] About as well as I do.
[time=2132] We weren't designed to live on our own.
[time=2135] You don't got this.
[time=2138] It's not going to work.
[time=2144] Workout principle number four.
[time=2146] Number one, don't dread it, smile.
[time=2148] Number two, repetition reaps rewards.
[time=2150] Number three, never trust you.
[time=2152] You need more than you.
[time=2155] Number four, if you want to gain, you have to lose.
[time=2160] Number four, if you want to gain, if you want to go forward, you have to lose.
[time=2166] What do I mean by this?
[time=2167] Look with me at the passage, verses seven and eight, but whatever things Paul says, here you go, but whatever things were gained to me, whatever things were cool to me, whatever things were awesome to me, whatever things I put great value in, whatever things were gained to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
[time=2184] More than that, I count all things to be lost.
[time=2188] In view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them, all those things I lost, but rubbish so that
[time=2200] I may gain Christ.
[time=2204] You want to gain?
[time=2205] You got to lose.
[time=2206] And never forget the first morning I met with Becky.
[time=2207] I scared me to death.
[time=2208] We're standing back there in the back.
[time=2210] She's just looking me up and down.
[time=2211] She says, "Why are you here?
[time=2213] What do you want?" I said, "Well, you know, the whole 42 ways think back to the 30s, and I got these kids at home that are still young, and I want to be able to play hoops in the driveway and throw the ball.
[time=2222] I got to stay at it.
[time=2223] So I need your help." She says, "All right.
[time=2225] So you want this?" I said, "Yes." I thought I was in boot camp.
[time=2230] She says, "You like Coke?" I'm thinking, "Oh gosh, just, okay, tell the truth." I said, "Yes, I love Coke with lemon." She says, "No more Coke." She says, "You hear me?" I said, "Yeah, I got it.
[time=2244] No more Coke." I go, "Okay.
[time=2246] I thought we were done.
[time=2247] I thought we were going to move on and start working out." She says, "No.
[time=2249] You like donuts?
[time=2251] You like cake?
[time=2252] You like cookies?
[time=2253] Do you?" I'm like, "Gosh." She's like a Christian.
[time=2257] I'm not going to lie to her.
[time=2258] She's going to, like, her spirit will detect my lying spirit, and then I'll be all embarrassed, and I don't lie anyway.
[time=2263] So yeah, I love donuts and cookies.
[time=2266] No more.
[time=2267] If I see you with one, I'm like, "It's okay.
[time=2270] I'm not going to have any more, I promise.
[time=2272] No Coke.
[time=2273] No donuts.
[time=2274] No cookies." I think we're done, but no.
[time=2276] There's more.
[time=2277] That's what you like creamy dressing, don't you?
[time=2281] I said, "Yes." I'm thinking.
[time=2283] Just tell the truth.
[time=2284] I said, "Yes." I love creamy dressing, and I know where you're going, and I hate vinaigrette, all right?
[time=2290] I hate oil and whatever.
[time=2291] She goes, "We'll get used to it." So then she's done, but now I'm all guilty and thinking about all the food stuff, and I should have loved well enough alone, and she's kind of starting to walk away, and I say, "Well, I guess that means I can't have my cereal at 10 o'clock at night, because I like having cereal." Two bowls, 10 o'clock at night.
[time=2310] Anybody with me?
[time=2312] She just crushed me.
[time=2313] No more.
[time=2314] Just crushed me.
[time=2316] She says, "You want to gain an essence?" Here's what she said.
[time=2319] "You want to gain that 38 waist back?
[time=2321] Lose the peanut butter, Captain Crunch at 10." And Paul goes on to say, "Paul goes on to say, it's not just the peanut butter, Captain Crunch.
[time=2330] It's not just the bad stuff.
[time=2332] It's anything that I may have attained.
[time=2335] It's anything I may have achieved or possessed anything that might in any way." Listen, church, please don't miss this.
[time=2342] Anything that might in any way come in between you and a deeper, more meaningful relationship
[time=2350] with Christ.
[time=2351] As the text says, anything that might in any way come in between you and a deeper, more
[time=2357] meaningful valuing of him.
[time=2362] I mean, this takes guts.
[time=2364] Are you hearing him?
[time=2365] Let's consider it all rubbish.
[time=2369] I think in the NIV it might say garbage.
[time=2375] The word means manure.
[time=2381] And I'll just leave it at that.
[time=2383] We'll just leave it at manure.
[time=2386] It's manure, he says.
[time=2389] "I view that stuff as dung.
[time=2394] I view it as waste." He says.
[time=2398] And that's where we get into a problem.
[time=2401] I won't speak for you.
[time=2402] I'll speak for me.
[time=2403] The problem is I don't view it as waste.
[time=2407] Too much of that stuff I view as cool.
[time=2417] Too much of the stuff that gets in the way between me and him I view as pretty neat.
[time=2426] And he says it's manure.
[time=2428] He says flush it, which is what you do with that stuff, right?
[time=2433] Flush it.
[time=2434] You'd better dislodge it, remove it, throw it away.
[time=2438] Anything that competes with intimacy with the Lord.
[time=2441] You want to gain him, lose you.
[time=2447] Blue cheese dressing isn't evil in and of itself, but it leads back to the 40s.
[time=2456] And there's a whole lot more in my life, my friends, and I would suspect there's a whole lot more in yours that needs attention more than blue cheese dressing.
[time=2467] You need a Becky in your life spiritually.
[time=2474] You need someone to speak the truth to you.
[time=2477] You need someone to remind you of what's right.
[time=2479] You need someone who is consistently committed to look you in the eye and say, I love you.
[time=2485] Knock it off or I will destroy you.
[time=2490] We need that because there's a whole lot more going on in your life and mind than dressing in donuts.
[time=2498] And we need a workout plan.
[time=2502] And we need this relationship between us and God helping us move down that road.
[time=2507] And all I hope you hear is Corbin and the team come this morning, oh, I hope you hear me today, my friends.
[time=2513] It has got to be less and less and less of you and more and more and more of him.
[time=2520] [AMEN] Let me ask you again.
[time=2523] [AMEN - 1 seconds] Let me just pray as we begin to worship.
[time=2526] Let's respond today in worship.
[time=2528] Please don't leave.
[time=2529] Let's just respond today as we lift our voices.
[time=2532] It's Corbin and the team lead us.
[time=2534] Oh, Father in heaven, how grateful we are for your word today, how thankful we are that it has washed over us.
[time=2542] And oh, God, as we respond to you this morning, as we lift our voices, may you be glorified.
[time=2547] May this truth that we've heard today sink even deeper into our minds and our lives.
[time=2553] Oh, God, we want to be strong and oh, God, we know we can't do it.
[time=2558] We need your hand under the bar.
[time=2561] We need your help.
[time=2563] And so, God, we come to you this morning begging for it.
[time=2566] And all the people agreed and said, "Hey, man, would you stand and let's worship our God together?"
[time=2596] Oh, Lord, I lift you high and bow down low, how high can you be, how low can I go, I
[time=2618] You must increase, I must decrease, Lord.
[time=2624] I lift you high and bow down low, how high can you be, how low can I go, I lift you
[time=2642] high and bow down low, how high can you be, how low can I go.
[time=2650] Oh, you must increase, I must decrease, Lord.
[time=2656] I'll bow down and you will be a drug.
[time=2667] You must increase, you must increase, I must decrease, Lord.
[time=2686] I lift you high and bow down low, how high can you be, how high can you be, how high
[time=2708] can you be, how low can I go, I lift you high and bow down low, how high can you be, how
[time=2730] low can I go, I lift you high and bow down low, how high can you be, how low can I go.
[time=2738] Oh, you must increase, Lord, how high can you be, how high can you be, how high can you
[time=2762] be, how high can you be, how high can you be, how high can you be, how high can you be,
[time=2977] be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith.
[time=2990] I want to know Christ, yes, to know the power of His resurrection and participation in His
[time=2997] sufferings, becoming like Him in His death, and so somehow attaining to the resurrection
[time=3004] from the dead.
[time=3034] And then for us, really you've been for us.
[time=3046] Christ is risen from the dead, tripping over death, my death.
[time=3052] Come away, come away, come and rise up from the ring.
[time=3058] Christ is risen from the dead.
[time=3061] We are one with Him again.
[time=3063] Come away, come away, come and rise up from the ring.
[time=3070] Oh, death, where is your sin?
[time=3076] Oh, hell, where is your victory?
[time=3082] Oh, Church, come stand in the light, the glory of God has defeated the night, singing
[time=3094] note, death, where is your sin?
[time=3100] Oh, hell, where is your victory?
[time=3106] Oh, Church, come stand in the light, our God is not dead.
[time=3113] He's alive, he's alive.
[time=3116] Christ is risen from the dead, tripping over death, my death.
[time=3122] Come away, come away, come and rise up from the ring.
[time=3128] Christ is risen from the dead.
[time=3131] We are one with Him again.
[time=3134] Come away, come away, come and rise up from the ring.
[time=3140] Christ is risen from the dead, tripping over death, my death.
[time=3145] Come away, come away, come and rise up from the ring.
[time=3151] Christ is risen from the dead.
[time=3154] We are one with Him again.
[time=3157] Come away, come away, come and rise up from the ring.
[time=3163] [AMEN] The same power that conquered the grave lives in me.
[time=3322] [AMEN] You know, as the guys play, let me just say this to you before we go, there are those of you in the room this morning, and you just sang that song, and that's really true of you, and you know it, you sense it.
[time=3339] You're at a place with God today, and the Spirit of God is alive and well in you.
[time=3345] He is strengthening you. He is envisioning you.
[time=3348] He is bringing greater levels of faith and courage to you.
[time=3353] You're not Superman. You're not Wonder Woman, but you know what? You're living faithfully in a way, and you know it's making a difference, and I'm thankful.
[time=3364] Amen? Get up in the morning and go to the gym.
[time=3367] That makes sense? Do not stop.
[time=3370] Keep giving yourself to him.
[time=3373] There are others of you in the room this morning, and in all honesty, you would say to me, "Had it at one time, I could feel the power of God conquered the grave, but not these days. It's not there." That makes you sad, and you long for a day again when you can walk with him in the strength of his might and his power, and we would love nothing more than to pray with you, to encourage you. We'd love nothing more than to pray with you who are doing well, going to give you a chance in fact elders. Past and present, would you make your way to the front down here on the floor?
[time=3417] We'd love nothing more than to pray with you who are doing well.
[time=3420] Encourage us and let us know. Staff, come on down.
[time=3424] Those of you who had it once, it's not there today and you know it, and then there are others of you in the room, and you would say to me today, you would say the truth be told. That's not me.
[time=3434] Honestly, power of God that conquered the grave, don't know what that is.
[time=3442] I'd like it. I'd like to know more about it.
[time=3446] I believe that it's possible, but no, I've never, never surrendered my heart fully to him.
[time=3453] We'd love to pray with you. We'd love to talk with you.
[time=3455] These guys will be down here at the front afterwards, as the team sings. Music continues to play.
[time=3461] You're welcome just to come down. Just let us encourage you.
[time=3463] Let us answer any questions. Let us put our arms around you.
[time=3466] Whatever needs you might have, we'll be down here to help you.
[time=3469] Father in heaven, we thank you for the morning.
[time=3472] We thank you for the opportunity you've given us to worship.
[time=3475] Oh God, I pray that because of this time, we would be different.
[time=3479] Keep working us out, God please.
[time=3482] Give us the courage to follow. In your son's name we pray. Amen.
