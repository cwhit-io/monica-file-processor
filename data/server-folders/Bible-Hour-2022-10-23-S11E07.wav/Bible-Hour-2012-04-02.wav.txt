[time=450] Let's put our hands together while we sing this next one
[time=462] Sing a great state, great state history Teeth is beating you, clever excuse me, sing it out Jesus is alive
[time=485] Give to cross the empty grave, I've eternal you, I've won the day, sing it out, Jesus is alive
[time=497] He's alive, sing it out, happy day, happy day You watch my sin away, oh, happy day, happy day I'll never be the same
[time=518] Oh, no, forever I can change
[time=529] When I send in that place Free life, make you face to face, I am yours, Jesus you are mine
[time=541] And let's join, let's join the perfect peace Earthly may find out He will receive to celebrate Jesus is alive
[time=555] He's alive, sing it out, happy day, happy day You watch my sin away, oh, happy day, happy day
[time=571] I'll never be the same, oh, no, forever I can change
[time=586] And don't what a glorious day What a glorious way, that you have saved me
[time=600] And don't what a glorious day What a glorious day, sing it out, happy day
[time=616] Happy day, you watch my sin away, oh, happy day, happy day I'll never be the same, oh, happy day, happy day
[time=632] You watch my sin away, oh, happy day, happy day I'll never be the same, oh, forever I can change
[time=650] What a glorious day, I'll never be the same, oh, forever I can change
[time=670] Rejoice greatly, O people of Zion, shout and triumph, O people of Jerusalem
[time=676] Look, your king is coming to you, he is righteous and victorious, yet he is humble, writing on a donkey, even a donkey's cult
[time=685] I will remove the battle chariots from Israel and the war horses from Jerusalem and I will destroy all of the weapons used in battle
[time=693] Your king will bring peace to the nations, his realm will stretch from sea to sea and from the Euphrates River to the ends of the Earth
[time=701] Because of the covenant I made with you, sealed with blood, I will free your prisoners from death in a waterless dungeon
[time=708] Come back to the safety, all you prisoners, for yet there is hope I promise this very day, I will repay you two mercies for each of your woes Because when we see you, we find strength to face the day
[time=730] In your presence, all our fears are washed away, washed away
[time=747] O Santa, you are the God who saves us worthy of all our praises, go Santa, go Santa, go Santa, come back away among us
[time=770] Welcome, your king, Lord Jesus
[time=786] As they came to the towns of Beth Fage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives, he sent two disciples ahead
[time=792] Go into that village over there, he told them, and as you enter it, you will see a cult tied there that has never been written
[time=799] Untie it and bring it here, if anyone asks what you are doing, just say the Lord needs it
[time=806] So they went and found the cult, just as Jesus had said, and sure enough, as they were untying, if the owners asked them, why are you untying our cult, and the disciples simply replied, the Lord needs it
[time=819] So they brought the cult to Jesus and threw their garments over it for him to write on
[time=825] Then the crowd spread out their coats on the road ahead of Jesus, as they reached the place where the road started down from the Mount of Olives
[time=832] All of his followers began to shout and sing as they walked along, praising God for all the wonderful miracles they had seen
[time=840] Bless the king who comes in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven and glory in highest heaven
[time=847] But some of the Pharisees among the crowd said, teacher, rebuke your followers for saying things like that
[time=853] He replied, if they kept quiet, the stones along the road would burst into tears
[time=883] After this, I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count
[time=908] Every nation tried people and language standing before the throne in front of the land
[time=915] They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands And they cried out in a loud voice, salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the land
[time=930] So when we see, when you find strength to face the day
[time=939] In your presence, hold our fears, I'll watch the way
[time=945] Sing that again, 'cause when we see you, we find strength to face the day
[time=956] In your presence, hold our fears, I'll watch the way, watch the way
[time=967] Sing that again, oh, stand up, you are the God who saves us
[time=979] It's worthy of all our praises, sing those hands down, oh, stand up
[time=991] Come on away among us, we welcome you, dear Lord Jesus
[time=1012] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest
[time=1025] Hosanna, Hosanna, oh, stand up
[time=1032] Hosanna in the highest
[time=1044] I want to read for you a poem by Joseph Bailey "King Jesus, why do you choose a lowly donkey to carry you to ride in your parade?
[time=1056] Had you no friend who owned a horse, a royal mount with spirit fit for a king to ride?
[time=1063] Why choose a cold, small, unassuming, beast of burden, trained to plow not carry kings?
[time=1074] King Jesus, why did you choose me, a lowly, unimportant person, to bear you in my world today?
[time=1083] I'm poor and unimportant, trained to work not carry kings, let alone the king of kings
[time=1091] And yet, you've chosen me to carry you in triumph in this world's parade
[time=1100] King Jesus, keep me small, so all may see how great you are
[time=1108] Keep me humble, so all may say, "Blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord
[time=1115] Not what a great coat he rides"
[time=1124] Hosanna, oh, stand up, Hosanna in the highest
[time=1151] human heart heal my body, make it be
[time=1157] open up my eyes to the things I don't see
[time=1165] show me how to last like you have loved me
[time=1179] to drink my heart for a great show Everything I am for your team down strong
[time=1191] as I walk up into eternity
[time=1208] Sing, Hosanna, oh, stand up
[time=1236] Hosanna, oh, stand up, Hosanna in the highest
[time=1288] Every secret, every shame, every fear, every pain
[time=1299] Lives inside the dark, but that's not who we are
[time=1306] We are children of the day
[time=1313] So bring up sleep, and lift your head You were meant for more than this Fight the shadows, conquer death Make most of the time we have left We are, out of the world We are, sitting on a gate We are, out of the world We have, got, got, a little action We are, out of the world We are, sitting on a gate We are, out of the world We got, got, got, a little action
[time=1354] Let the light shine, let the light shine
[time=1364] We are called to spread the news
[time=1371] To tell the world simple truth
[time=1377] Jesus came to say this freedom in His name
[time=1384] So let His love break the news
[time=1390] We are, out of the world We are, sitting on a gate We are, out of the world We got, got, a little action We are, out of the world We are, sitting on a gate We are, out of the world We got, got, got, a little action We are, out of the light We got, out of the light So spread your light shine, right We are, out of the light We got, out of the light Jesus, we are, out of the light We are, out of the light We will lift you by, and shine, shine, shine
[time=1443] We are, out of the world We got, sitting on a gate We are, out of the world We got, got, got, a little action We are, out of the world We got, sitting on a gate
[time=1462] [MUSIC - 14 seconds]
[time=1489] (audience clapping) - That last song that he just sang there,
[time=1499] we're the light of the world to the extent
[time=1507] that we abide in him.
[time=1509] It's his light.
[time=1512] He's the source, and we are light bearers.
[time=1520] What an incredible privilege.
[time=1522] About 30 years ago, I was sitting in what we call
[time=1533] the asylum today, and some of you remember when that was the church.
[time=1538] And not many of you remember when that was the church.
[time=1543] It had pews, and there was a balcony
[time=1549] with pews, and the Bible hour was first produced there in that place that we called the chapel after we built the Convocation Center across the street.
[time=1562] They moved in there.
[time=1563] And Rick Hawks was teaching, well, it was either a Sunday night or a Wednesday night, and I don't know if he was the youth pastor still or our senior pastor, but I know it was the early 80s because we got rid of the pews a little bit later than that.
[time=1579] And I remember sitting on that left side, just past the balcony, about three pews in on the left, and Rick was teaching.
[time=1591] And he taught on this passage that we're gonna look at this morning.
[time=1597] And I remember, I don't know what caused me to go
[time=1604] where I went that night in the passage.
[time=1607] I'm sure part of it was him.
[time=1609] Part of it was just a word.
[time=1610] I'm sure the Holy Spirit had a lot to do with it, but I went someplace that night that changed me.
[time=1617] Just had a huge impact.
[time=1621] And I've been looking forward to teaching on Philippians 3, 12 through 21 for 30 years, so get ready.
[time=1628] (congregation laughs) That night, I realized that this passage of scripture moved me to some places in scripture, along with it,
[time=1645] that answered a question that had been really plaguing me and others, especially high school students.
[time=1656] In those days, Tom Cashman was actually skinny and young.
[time=1663] And the students would ask us, what's God's will for our life?
[time=1669] Because about 17, 18 is the first time you really start caring about that.
[time=1674] And about the time you're ready to leave high school,
[time=1680] people really start to care about where's next, what is next, what am I supposed to do?
[time=1689] And they'd ask those questions.
[time=1692] And we had good guidance programs and we gave them aptitude tests and we did all kinds of things to help them think about what they might be good at and what they could do and where they could go and what they might enjoy and how they could be productive and the input they might be able to make.
[time=1707] And that wasn't satisfying usually because a lot of students really wanted to know, what's God want me to do and where does God want me to go?
[time=1722] And that night over there, I got an answer.
[time=1727] Verse 12, chapter three, Philippians.
[time=1739] Not that I have already obtained all this
[time=1745] or have already been made perfect.
[time=1753] But I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
[time=1760] Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it, this Paul.
[time=1766] But one thing I do, forgetting what is behind
[time=1772] and straining, that word's best said like this.
[time=1781] Straining, it really is the kind of word that it's every ounce of energy that you can muster up and use and put toward something.
[time=1794] It's that kind of word he's straining ahead.
[time=1798] The kind of force I used to use when I'd be under the car trying to loosen a rusty bolt and put both hands on the wrench and try and smack my knuckles.
[time=1810] But I just, with every ounce of energy, it's the kind of energy that a guy uses coming out of the starting blocks for 100 yard dash, just exploding out of their straining ahead.
[time=1822] Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,
[time=1832] I press on toward the goal to win the prize
[time=1838] for which God has called me heavenward.
[time=1842] That was the answer to my question in Christ Jesus.
[time=1848] I thought, oh my goodness.
[time=1853] This fits really well with Hebrews 11.
[time=1861] They didn't get to the place, they were promised.
[time=1866] This is a direction, God's called me to be who he wants me to be on the way to him.
[time=1874] And he's the way, not only am I heavenward going toward him,
[time=1882] he's the way to get there.
[time=1888] Jesus said, I'm the way, the truth and the life.
[time=1893] No man comes to the Father, but by me.
[time=1895] Then Paul says, all of us who are mature
[time=1901] should take such a view of things.
[time=1903] And if on some point you think differently, that too, God will make clear to you.
[time=1910] God will work that out with you.
[time=1912] Only let us live up to what we have already attained.
[time=1916] Join with others in following my example brothers
[time=1922] and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you.
[time=1925] For as I have often told you before and now say again, even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.
[time=1934] Their destiny is destruction.
[time=1938] Their God is their stomach.
[time=1940] Their destiny is destruction.
[time=1946] Their God is their stomach.
[time=1950] And their glory is in their shame.
[time=1953] Their mind is on earthly things.
[time=1959] But our citizenship is in heaven.
[time=1967] And we eagerly await a savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that we will be like his glorious body.
[time=1993] Father in heaven, thank you so much
[time=2006] for transforming us.
[time=2008] Thank you, Father, that you have seen fit to choose us, to redeem us, to ransom us, to save us, to adopt us, lowly, undeserving.
[time=2024] And you've chosen to love us that way.
[time=2029] We want to respond to you appropriately, God.
[time=2033] Help us, please.
[time=2035] Please help us understand whatever it is you have for us, Lord, in this passage of Scripture.
[time=2041] Please move, and in us, I pray your spirit would just move us, please.
[time=2046] In Christ's name I pray, amen.
[time=2048] All in one direction, no matter where you are in the world, if you're with believers, you're headed the same way.
[time=2064] Let's look at verses 12 through 14 again.
[time=2068] I have not arrived until I'm with him in heaven.
[time=2075] There's no place to arrive here.
[time=2078] Verse 12, not that I have already obtained all this or have already been made perfect, he's referring back to everything he has said in chapters one, two, and the first half of three.
[time=2090] Paul says, I haven't arrived, I haven't attained all this yet.
[time=2095] Or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
[time=2106] I'm gonna take hold of what Christ Jesus did in taking hold of me.
[time=2113] Brothers, I do not consider myself yet
[time=2119] to have taken hold of it, but one thing I do, forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
[time=2138] There was, when I thought that through
[time=2149] and it dawned on me, oh my goodness, my life is a direction.
[time=2153] Wherever he takes me, wherever he takes me,
[time=2162] not where I figure out I have to go, wherever he takes me, I'm called to be there.
[time=2171] If I'm abiding in him, he'll make it clear.
[time=2177] One of the things I believed in a long time ago, and I go to our elders and ask them, I think God wants me to do this.
[time=2185] I've made two big career moves in my life that the elders said, yep, you ought to do that.
[time=2192] I believe God was moving that way.
[time=2194] I always wanna do whatever's broader or deeper
[time=2201] for building the kingdom.
[time=2203] The job offers I kept getting when I was working here as an associate pastor at Black Hawk Christian School, the job offers I kept getting were for more money to do the same thing.
[time=2212] They weren't broader, they weren't deeper and so God just kept me doing the same stuff for 24 years here.
[time=2219] I wanna press on toward the goal to win the prize
[time=2227] for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
[time=2231] I want to be going in his direction.
[time=2237] And I have some pretty good company.
[time=2239] Look at Hebrews 11, will ya?
[time=2243] Hebrews chapter 11 is that faith chapter.
[time=2248] It lists all of those great saints in the Old Testament that did what God called them to do and they moved toward him and he promised them life and they thought many of them thought they were going to a place.
[time=2268] And they died and Hebrews 11, 39 says, "These were all commended for their faith." Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Gideon.
[time=2279] There's a long list in there, Rahab.
[time=2281] Yet none of them received what had been promised.
[time=2288] Verse 40.
[time=2295] "Since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect."
[time=2306] God is making perfect Abraham, Isaac,
[time=2313] and Jacob with us when we get there.
[time=2316] That's good company.
[time=2326] Are you in the transformation process?
[time=2333] That's a great question.
[time=2336] Am I in the process of being transformed?
[time=2340] When students would ask me later, I want to know what God's will for my life is, I'd say I know his will for your life.
[time=2348] It's to go toward him and I urge you brethren and view of God's mercies to present your body a living sacrifice wholly and pleasing to God, which is your spiritual act of worship.
[time=2363] I said that he wants you to present your body to him.
[time=2367] Do not be conformed any longer to the patterns of this world.
[time=2373] Don't get trapped in doing the things that people who have earthly minds do.
[time=2384] Do not be conformed to those patterns, but be transformed by renewing your mind.
[time=2391] God wants me and he wants you to be in the renewing process all the days we're here.
[time=2399] Renewing our minds.
[time=2403] We say that the Scripture is true and we lift it up as one of our five elements.
[time=2408] And we say prayerful abiding in Christ is absolutely necessary in order for us to be in the transformation process.
[time=2417] His word and prayer keep us focused on his ways, his thoughts, not ours.
[time=2425] Earthly minded people listen to other people's opinions about how to do life and they listen to their own opinions about how to do life.
[time=2437] Heavenly minded people seek his ways
[time=2443] and his thoughts and they renew their minds.
[time=2448] And their minds are being renewed in the renewing process every day because I need that.
[time=2454] My flesh keeps jerking me back to thinking like earthly people.
[time=2461] And I have to be in the renewing process being transformed in Christ
[time=2470] in order to experience a heavenward direction.
[time=2476] Paul uses that metaphor of running,
[time=2484] racing, prizes all over the place.
[time=2486] One of them is 1 Corinthians 9, 24.
[time=2489] We can look at that one. I just picked one.
[time=2491] Do you not know that in a race all the runners run but only one gets the prize?
[time=2496] Run in such a way as to get the prize.
[time=2500] Strain.
[time=2503] There's an effort on my part.
[time=2507] God wants me to strain toward heaven like a runner who's running to get the prize.
[time=2515] Every single one of us should run as though we're running there for toward him and we just are looking forward to the prize.
[time=2526] He'll decide what we get.
[time=2528] But I know there's perfection in Christ.
[time=2530] Prize enough.
[time=2532] Secondly, verses 15 and 16,
[time=2541] I just noted that mature Christians live up to what they have attained.
[time=2551] All of us then who are mature should take such a view of things.
[time=2555] And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear.
[time=2559] I love that.
[time=2560] I might think a little differently than what, but God will make it clear to me.
[time=2564] And you know what?
[time=2565] He does shape our own thinking differently than somebody else's.
[time=2568] In different circumstances, the spirit of God working in us, we're unique.
[time=2574] Now, depending on him though, to make that clear, that's the key.
[time=2578] God too will make it clear.
[time=2585] Verse 16, "Only let us live up to what we have already attained."
[time=2591] Well, what have we attained?
[time=2598] All that stuff he said in the beginning of Philippians.
[time=2602] And much of what God has revealed to us all through the Bible, and I picked one place to just read through to help us think through what it is we've attained.
[time=2616] Let's look at Ephesians chapter 2 verses 1 through 7.
[time=2624] He says, "As for you, you were dead." Do you realize that?
[time=2630] You were dead in your transgressions and sins.
[time=2635] You, all of us, were separated from God due to our transgressions and sins.
[time=2643] In which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world.
[time=2648] Don't do that now.
[time=2650] And of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who's now at work in those who are disobedient, earthly-minded people.
[time=2663] All of us also lived among them at one time, trying the cravings of our flesh. I still fight that.
[time=2674] And following its desires and thoughts like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath.
[time=2683] God's justice.
[time=2685] But because of his great love for us, for me, because of his great love for us, God who is rich in mercy made us alive, not dead.
[time=2697] Alive with Christ, even when we were dead in transgressions.
[time=2702] It is by grace you have been saved, made us alive in Christ,
[time=2708] positioned us with him, past tense.
[time=2712] We've been positioned, watchmen knee, sit, walk, stand.
[time=2716] We're seated with Christ.
[time=2720] And he's at the right hand of the Father.
[time=2723] Your name's already there if you've come to know Christ.
[time=2727] It's just a matter of a little bit of time compared to a whole lot of eternity
[time=2733] before you'll realize that.
[time=2736] And the extent to which I can realize my position in him now empowers me to live a heavenly-minded life.
[time=2748] Are you aware that he snatched you out of all of that earthly junk
[time=2754] that still pulls at you?
[time=2757] That he snatched you, that he adopted you, that he saved you, that he loves you so much, that through the blood of his son he positioned you beside him.
[time=2768] That's who you really are.
[time=2773] And I thought, what's the best way to illustrate that?
[time=2777] I just love for everybody to get excited about the cross of Christ and what that meant in your life and what it means in your life today.
[time=2791] And I thought, the best way for you to think about that
[time=2798] is to think about your own testimony.
[time=2802] You know you.
[time=2806] You know what he snatched you from.
[time=2811] You know what he's snatching you from today.
[time=2818] You know the power that he gives you today, your testimony in Christ.
[time=2822] He has seated you and you need to rejoice in that.
[time=2825] So what I want to do is take just a minute, less than that, because it's a long time on television.
[time=2831] Just a minute and I want you to think about who you are outside of him
[time=2842] and who you are because of him, his blood shed for you,
[time=2849] positioning you in the heavenlies with Christ.
[time=2879] Thank you, Lord.
[time=2896] Thank you.
[time=2900] Filthy, worthy, deserving of the wrath of God.
[time=2909] Instead of his wrath through the blood, a son.
[time=2921] Verse 17.
[time=2924] Our citizenship is in heaven.
[time=2935] Join with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you.
[time=2944] For as I have often told you before, and I'll say again, even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.
[time=2954] Their destiny is destruction.
[time=2959] Their God is their stomach.
[time=2965] What that really means, that word is an incredible word.
[time=2968] It talks about all the appetites you can think of that could be placed in front of God himself.
[time=2975] Any appetite you have in the flesh,
[time=2986] their mind is on earthly things.
[time=2992] But our citizenship, brothers and sisters, born again, believers in Jesus Christ, our citizenship
[time=3004] is in heaven, and we eagerly await a Savior from there.
[time=3013] The Lord Jesus Christ, who by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control,
[time=3020] will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.
[time=3029] Do you understand, will be like him?
[time=3033] Can you believe it?
[time=3035] I can't, but I do.
[time=3044] Nancy and I have been in a lot of countries.
[time=3048] I'd say 25, 30 countries the last 10 years.
[time=3053] And we have been able to do so many amazing things.
[time=3060] One of the things that I noticed is they don't let me in unless I have my passport.
[time=3068] They want to see it, and a lot of them would like to have it.
[time=3074] You hear a lot about bad things about the U.S., U.S. passport is a very nice item to have.
[time=3083] But I want to tell you something, unless they ask me what country my citizenship is,
[time=3090] when I get asked about citizenship, I try to tell people about the fact that I'm a citizen
[time=3096] of the kingdom of the living God.
[time=3100] And I happen to be blessed and thankful that I get to live in this country while I'm here,
[time=3106] but I'm not here long.
[time=3113] Our citizenship is in heaven, and that changes everything.
[time=3125] The only passport stamp that matters is the blood of Christ,
[time=3133] and the seal of the Holy Spirit in me.
[time=3141] Praise Him.
[time=3143] He chose that.
[time=3145] He chose to take me to His kingdom.
[time=3151] He chose to give me opportunity to worship Him now while I'm headed there.
[time=3162] Hebrews 11 again, those great people of faith look back there, verse 13.
[time=3168] All these people were still living by faith when they died.
[time=3173] They did not receive the things promised.
[time=3176] They only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth.
[time=3188] They say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own.
[time=3192] If they'd been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return.
[time=3198] Instead, they were longing for a better country, a heavenly one.
[time=3205] Therefore, God has not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them and for us.
[time=3212] Corwin was singing about that light when we get there.
[time=3216] Revelation 21 says, "No sun, no moon, no need."
[time=3222] He's the light.
[time=3225] He's all the light we'll need.
[time=3231] My first wife, many of you don't know, a few of you do.
[time=3236] Renee died 16 years ago this month.
[time=3240] She was sick for a year and we went through a lot of incredible life together then.
[time=3251] It came down to the night she was dying.
[time=3255] We were at the hospital.
[time=3260] I was trying to help.
[time=3263] It was obvious that she wasn't doing well.
[time=3266] A nurse told me that this probably was it.
[time=3269] I crawled up in bed with her and her eyes were kind of rolled back.
[time=3275] Tears of joy, by the way.
[time=3282] Nancy knows how thankful I am for her and for Renee.
[time=3288] Tears of joy.
[time=3291] I'm holding her there and the breathing was so difficult.
[time=3294] I just wondered to go.
[time=3298] So I'm saying go.
[time=3301] Go to heaven.
[time=3302] Go to be with the Lord Jesus.
[time=3304] Go.
[time=3305] And I'm saying take her, take her.
[time=3308] Just crying out begging would you do that?
[time=3312] And he did.
[time=3316] And I'm not kidding you.
[time=3317] I don't know if it was like the seconds before her last breath.
[time=3323] In the middle of her last breath.
[time=3327] Right after.
[time=3329] I don't know but I'm just telling you this.
[time=3332] I just jerked up in that bed and I had this urge.
[time=3338] You know what it's like when one of your kids is kind of missing and you've lost them in a store or something you're worried about.
[time=3343] There's a panic that comes over you that you want to find them.
[time=3347] I just wanted to take off after her.
[time=3349] I knew I could chase her down.
[time=3352] If I knew what direction to go.
[time=3355] But I didn't, it wasn't out the door.
[time=3358] I didn't know if it was up or down or over or whatever.
[time=3361] But I remember just that panic feeling.
[time=3364] It didn't last very long.
[time=3366] Because I realized you know shortly three to five seconds probably oh my she's going to be with the Lord.
[time=3371] But my first instinct you guys was to chase her down.
[time=3381] I don't know what direction her spirit went.
[time=3385] If it went in a direction as we know it at all.
[time=3390] I don't know.
[time=3392] But I know this.
[time=3396] She knew the way.
[time=3404] And it wasn't a place, he's a person.
[time=3412] He's the way.
[time=3416] And I am willing to go to any place that he takes me.
[time=3425] It's not that long here anyhow.
[time=3429] I do know this.
[time=3431] I want to be going the right direction no matter what place I'm in.
[time=3439] Do you know him that way?
[time=3443] Paul does.
[time=3446] I want to know him that way.
[time=3451] Father in Heaven, thank you Lord for your word, for power in your words.
[time=3459] In your thoughts.
[time=3461] Your thoughts are higher than ours.
[time=3463] Yours, your ways are higher than ours.
[time=3465] Just like you said, like the heavens are higher than the earth.
[time=3468] Your thoughts and your ways are higher than ours.
[time=3471] We can't get there without you.
[time=3474] Thank you for the cross.
[time=3479] Thank you for making a way for us to come to you.
[time=3485] I'm so grateful.
[time=3488] Thank you Lord.
[time=3490] [AMEN]
