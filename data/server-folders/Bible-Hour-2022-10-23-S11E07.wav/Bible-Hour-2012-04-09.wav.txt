[time=338] Christ has risen indeed.
[time=341] Today we celebrate our Lord's triumph over sin and death and the good news that eternal life has broken into this life to be enjoyed now and for all time.
[time=353] In the next few minutes, Corbin and Tanya are going to sing about how God can make beautiful things out of dust and out of us.
[time=362] The cross is a perfect example of how God can take something that seems broken beyond repair, something lost, empty and dark and make something absolutely beautiful.
[time=375] God is the ultimate artist.
[time=378] He is not limited by the material he uses.
[time=381] We asked a couple artists in our church family to craft something as they were inspired by the song we were about to hear.
[time=388] So look, listen and soak in the truth that God is able to make beautiful things out of anything.
[time=396] [MUSIC - 47 seconds]
[time=448] You make beautiful things out of the dust. You make beautiful things. You make beautiful things out of us.
[time=477] Matthew Stump used the lyrics of this song to inspire the window art you see beside me, took a common ordinary window pane and turned it into a beautiful image of the depth of God's love for us.
[time=489] Dust is ordinary.
[time=493] It is so small the slightest breeze carries it away.
[time=496] We only notice that when it clicks around our houses, and let me wipe it away. It's a nuisance to us.
[time=504] Useless. God used the very dust of the earth to form man in his image. This window pane wasn't
[time=512] special, but Matt made it into something special, something beautiful. Dust is not special, but God's
[time=519] breath gives life and beauty to what is insignificant on its own. He makes beautiful things out of
[time=526] the dust that is us. We lack the power to make ourselves into anything other than the dust from
[time=533] which we came, but he can and will make us into something more if we let him. He will use dust.
[time=541] He will use our broken lives. He will use death, even death on a cross. He made Adam from dust,
[time=551] knit Jesus together in the womb of a common young girl and turned the horrific torture and death
[time=558] of his only son into victory and salvation for all who believe. This God does not need us
[time=565] to try to make ourselves into something beautiful for him. We cannot. He wants us to be willing to let
[time=573] him make us into something beautiful.
[time=603] "You make beautiful things, you make beautiful things out of the dust. You make beautiful things,
[time=620] you make beautiful things out of the dust."
[time=633] Hillary Richard found paper, trash and discarded materials and crafted them into small butterflies.
[time=640] She carefully attached them to a canvas to design the beautiful winged creation you see here.
[time=646] Butterflies spend a good portion of their short lives becoming. Their journey is not so different
[time=654] from ours. It begins in the dust, but ends in the freedom of flight. They begin their lives tied to
[time=661] the ground crawling, creeping, searching for food. The transformation into winged beauty takes time
[time=668] and a passage through the dark confinement of a cocoon. While we see his waist brokenness
[time=676] and darkness, he and only he can weave together into such beauty as we cannot imagine. He knows
[time=686] what he can do with dust and with a debris of broken lives. Just as Hillary beautifully crafted
[time=692] this butterfly from things we would throw away, our God can take all the broken pieces of our lives
[time=699] into his loving hands and through the cleansing power of the cross, Christ our Savior, make us
[time=707] into something beautiful.
[time=720] You make me new. You are making me new. Oh, you make me new. You are making me new.
[time=744] Make beautiful things. You make me new. You make beautiful things. You make beautiful things.
[time=761] You make me new. You make me new. You make me new. You make me new. You make me new.
[time=805] [MUSIC]
[time=812] Well, good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour and what a morning this is. As you watch this,
[time=818] we prepare here at Blackhawk to celebrate Resurrection Sunday. That's right. It's a Sunday that we've
[time=824] been preparing for for weeks. It is something that we have anticipated really for months since
[time=830] the last one. It is the most significant, the most amazing, the most important Sunday of all.
[time=837] And as you join us today, I hope that your heart and mind are open to what God will have for you.
[time=843] I want to ask you a question as we begin this morning. What do you have in common with a woman,
[time=851] a married woman who also spends time as a prostitute? That's right. It might seem like an odd
[time=860] question for an Easter Sunday morning, but I want you to think about this. How is your life and the condition of your heart similar to a married woman who lives a life of prostitution? The fact of the
[time=872] matter is the Old Testament tells a story of a woman named Gomer. And the story is an amazing
[time=879] story not just because of all that Gomer did and not just because of all that she was involved in, but it's amazing because of where she ended up. In her brokenness in the chains of her sin,
[time=890] in the weariness of her iniquity, she finds herself at this point where God sends her husband
[time=897] back to her to literally buy her back off the auction block. He buys her back and it's this
[time=905] incredible picture that God's giving to the nation of Israel. And I just want you to see it today.
[time=911] I want you to be reminded of his great love. I want you to be informed all over again that
[time=917] no matter how far you go, he's willing to redeem you. It's what that word means. Redeem means to buy back and we're going to celebrate that picture of redemption today in our service. I hope that
[time=929] it'll be an encouragement to you. I hope you can share it with others. Don't forget you can watch all of our messages online at blackhawkministries.org. Happy Resurrection Sunday to you, even though
[time=940] it's a week late, we want you to be rejoicing all over again as to what God did and the opportunity
[time=947] we had as a family to gather and celebrate that this morning. God bless you. And thank you so much for being a part of our family. Thank you so much for tuning in. And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=970] God is risen today. Alleluia, sons of men and angels say. Alleluia, raise your joys and triumphs.
[time=988] Halleluia, sing the heavens under three-ply. Halleluia, halleluia. Hallelu, halleluia.
[time=1015] Lives again our glorious King. Halleluia, where o' death is now thy sting. Halleluia, dying once
[time=1034] see your good life. Halleluia, where thy victory o' gray. Halleluia, halleluia. Hallelu, halleluia.
[time=1064] Thank you Ben, Jamie, and Tanya. Well, my friends, I believe that one of the most compelling truths
[time=1083] regarding man's relationship with God, one of the most compelling truths of all time is
[time=1091] powerfully brought to the forefront of our minds right here this morning in the midst of our
[time=1097] resurrection celebration. And what is that compelling truth? That compelling truth is this.
[time=1104] Listen, at the resurrection of Jesus, if genuinely embraced, can literally transform people.
[time=1120] It can utterly and completely change their lives, the resurrection of Jesus. It's that
[time=1128] powerful. Let me say it to you this way, the power of the resurrection, which is available
[time=1134] to those willing to follow the one who was resurrected, the power of the resurrection
[time=1140] transforms people who are slaves to sin, caught in sin, stuck in sin, bound by the chains of sin,
[time=1151] and it turns them into slaves for God. The resurrection can transform you. It can turn you into a slave
[time=1166] to what is right instead of living as a slave to what is wrong. The resurrection changes people
[time=1175] from the shame and despair of sin's bondage to the freedom and healing of God's redeeming love.
[time=1182] I see it all the time. From the humiliation of our repeated failures,
[time=1190] raise your hand this morning if you're a repeat offender of God. From the humiliation that I know
[time=1198] you've experienced and I've experienced of our repeated failures to the joy of his repetitious
[time=1205] grace, his repeated grace, this is what can happen. My friends, there's a message
[time=1212] that we want you to hear today, a Savior, a rescuer, we want you to meet, but first there is a very
[time=1218] important word, a word that I want you to understand, a word that's crucial to the meaning of the
[time=1227] resurrection, and in order to better understand this one word, there is an immoral, unfaithful
[time=1234] woman and her husband I'd like you to meet. Now the word, the word my friends, is redeemed.
[time=1245] Say that back to me. Redeemed. Do you know what the word means? The word redeemed. The idea of
[time=1251] redemption is basically this. We'll talk more about it, but here's the scoop on redemption.
[time=1256] Redemption is when someone who is helpless, someone who is stuck, someone who is at the end of their
[time=1263] road is bought back to life, bought back in a loving way, bought back from the brink
[time=1275] by the careful, gracious love of another. This word redeemed is something I want you to
[time=1284] understand better this morning. The woman and her husband, I want you to meet them right now.
[time=1292] My good friends, we are here today to tell you a tale of entry, adventure, mystery, drama, love,
[time=1311] love. Yes, love. It is a strange and timely tale. A love story. Ah yes, the story of Josea
[time=1322] and his wife. And her name was? Well the story is a lot better if you don't have to say her name.
[time=1329] Yeah, but her name is important. Her name was Gomer. If there's a lesson learned from this story,
[time=1337] it's to not name your daughter Gomer. Oh, but there's a much greater lesson to be learned from our
[time=1343] tale today. Gomer was a prostitute. Josea was a prophet. Not exactly the kind of match that you
[time=1351] would find on eharmony.com. Yeah, but the internet, it wasn't around yet. So God was this matchmaker.
[time=1359] Indeed. And if there's one thing you must learn from our tale today, one thing more than anything,
[time=1365] it was that Josea loved Gomer. Please, please, do you know where my wife is? Her name is Gomer.
[time=1377] Please, have you seen her? Please, Gomer. Josea searched and searched for her.
[time=1387] But he never found her. That is until he looked in the red light district of the northern kingdom.
[time=1393] In spite of her lies. In spite of her adultery. Josea loved Gomer. In spite of her cruelty.
[time=1401] In spite of her sin. Josea loved Gomer. Why won't you leave me alone? I'm not good enough for you.
[time=1411] I can't live my life as a prophet's wife. Please, stop rescuing me, Josea.
[time=1417] But I love you. Listen to me. I don't care how many brothels you have pulled me out of.
[time=1423] I will return to them sooner or later. Your love is not strong enough to hold me.
[time=1428] I'm not the woman you dreamed I could be. Am I? No. You're not the woman I dreamed you to be.
[time=1438] Not now. Not yet. You are a dreamer. And you're my wife. I'm not your wife. I quit. I gave up.
[time=1451] Can't you hear me? I hear you. Then leave me alone. No. I love you.
[time=1465] Do you have any pride? Do you have any self-respect? I have love. That wasn't the question.
[time=1475] You're ruining my business. Your love is humiliating. I know it is.
[time=1483] But it is also strong. Josea was a romantic in the purest form. Every fiber of his being
[time=1494] was love. Every thought. Every breath. Every moment was consumed with this God-given love for his wife. Like a madman to the world.
[time=1504] Josea kept searching and searching for his unrequited love.
[time=1508] And no one, not browning nor Shakespeare. Norma Cartney, Orlin, it could write a song like Josea lived. Yeah, but this romance was a nightmare.
[time=1518] Josea was a failure. And yet, Josea loved Goma. And at the apex of this romantic catastrophe,
[time=1529] we find Josea yet again searching the inner city for his lost love.
[time=1534] And we find Goma captured and chained to an auction block.
[time=1538] She was an elderly sight to look upon, bruised and beaten, exposed and humiliated.
[time=1544] Chained and captured like an animal. A broken woman who had nothing left.
[time=1549] Before the auction began, Josea ran to his home, gathered all his possessions, his money, his food,
[time=1556] anything of value. And when they started the bidding, Josea ran towards the auction block.
[time=1562] And who will give me five checkles? Five checkles? Who will give me five checkles for this woman?
[time=1565] Who will give me five checkles? Five checkles here. Who will give me seven? Who will give me seven?
[time=1568] Seven, seven checkles right here to this gentleman. Find specimen of a woman. Who will give me ten?
[time=1572] Who will give me ten checkles right here? Ten. Who will give me twelve? Twelve? Twelve checkles.
[time=1576] Twelve checkles right here. Who will give me fifteen? Fifteen. Who will give me fifteen checkles for this woman? Who will give me fifteen right here? Fifteen checkles going once, going twice. And I will give everything I have.
[time=1587] The crowds parted as Josea handed over all his money and every morsel of food that he had.
[time=1598] He covered her trembling, humiliated body. He picked up this beaten woman who had been
[time=1606] caged and chained like an animal. We see the chains fall as he carries her home. Paid in full.
[time=1615] Relentless, romantic, solid as a rock. Love to the extreme, unthinkable, unfathomable.
[time=1625] My dear friends, we hope today that you see the story behind the story here.
[time=1630] Before the time when God looked down on the auction block of us and saw you and saw me.
[time=1639] An ugly sight to look upon, bruised and beaten, exposed and humiliated,
[time=1645] chained and captured like an animal, broken with nothing left.
[time=1651] And before the bang of the gavel, the earth quaked as God shouted, "I will give everything
[time=1657] that I have!" And the hammer fell and the ransom was laid down. Paid in full.
[time=1664] God sent his only son into this wicked world. To die on a Friday. To rise again on a Sunday.
[time=1679] And in this act, we see what love is. We see what real redemption is.
[time=1686] God paid the price tag for our sins, my sin, and for yours.
[time=1692] By giving up what was most precious to him. Something so costly.
[time=1698] The life of his son, Jesus. We have been paid for. We have been bought back.
[time=1709] No more auctions. No more chains. We have been redeemed.
[time=1729] Once in darkness. Now in light. Once blind. Now you see. Once a sinner. Now a saint.
[time=1750] Once bound. Now free. That's the power of the cross.
[time=1761] See the chains fall. That's the power of the cross. See the chains fall.
[time=1781] Once a stranger. Now a child. And he. Now fail. Once condemned. Now reconcile.
[time=1802] Broken. Now healed. That's the power of the cross. See the chains fall.
[time=1819] That's the power of the cross. See the chains fall.
[time=1832] That's the power of the cross.
[time=1847] Once a child. Now home. Once lost. Now bound.
[time=1857] Once in enemy. Now all the rain. Once more now around.
[time=1870] That's the power of the cross. See the chains fall.
[time=1916] See your chains. The chains fall.
[time=1945] Thank you Denise. That is the power of the cross my friends. We were once lost and now
[time=1951] we are found. Once in enemy. Now a friend. Once poor. Now crowned. No more chains.
[time=1959] It is the power of the cross and it is the great message of this glorious resurrection
[time=1966] Sunday. And we will come back to Hosea and Gomer. I know most of you in the room know the story
[time=1974] for those of you that don't want a picture of God's redeeming love. What a picture of his
[time=1981] faithful pursuit. He had Gomer and Hosea go through all of that. It was a picture of his love for
[time=1988] Israel. Israel's unfaithfulness. Israel's iniquity. Israel's unwillingness to be the people that God
[time=1997] had called her to be. Your Gomer. I'm Gomer. Hosea is God. And we see this picture of this
[time=2012] relentless like you got to be kidding me. Relentless. Faithful. Love. And we'll come back to that
[time=2022] in a little bit right now though. I want to open up the Word of God. I hope you'll take your
[time=2028] Bibles. I want to try my best to explain what the Spirit of God's help. What actually happened
[time=2034] to you in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Not so much what happened physically to him.
[time=2043] I want you to hear the truth this morning regarding the implications, the spiritual realities of the
[time=2050] resurrection for you. And not so much from a practical perspective, but this morning I want you to see
[time=2058] the resurrection of Jesus Christ from a doctrinal perspective. And immediately when I say that,
[time=2065] there are those of you in the room that go, oh no, wait a minute, doctrinal. Kelly, come on.
[time=2068] This is Easter. Easter's supposed to be light and fluffy in general and everybody's got to be able to understand it and you're going to go doctrinal on us. I'm going to go doctrinal on you today.
[time=2080] I'm going to go doctrinal. I want you to see some things. I want you to understand some things.
[time=2086] And maybe I'll just set it up like this. There is the practical side and it's not a bad side at
[time=2094] all. There is the practical side. The practical side of the resurrection, listen, is that it happened.
[time=2104] It physically literally happened as promised through prophecy hundreds of years earlier on the third
[time=2110] day after a brutal death in a real garden tomb just outside Jerusalem. The power of God rolled
[time=2117] away the stone enclosure and Jesus of Nazareth, the Savior, our Redeemer, was revived from death,
[time=2124] walked out of the grave alive, fact, not fiction. It really happened. I was reading this week. It
[time=2134] won't be on the screen. Let me just read this to you. John 19. John 19, talk about it happened.
[time=2141] John 1935. It says, and this is John, the disciple who Jesus, what? The disciple who Jesus loved.
[time=2151] This is John who was there. This is John who witnessed everything. John 1935, just listen.
[time=2158] And he who has seen John has testified and his testimony is true and he knows that he is telling
[time=2168] the truth so that you also may believe. It really happened. The crucifixion of our Lord and the
[time=2179] resurrection, John 20. John 20 verses 30 and 31, listen. Therefore, many other, this is after the
[time=2187] resurrection, John who was there, writes, therefore, many other signs. Jesus also performed in the
[time=2193] presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book, but these have been written so that
[time=2199] you may, what? Believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have
[time=2207] life in his name. Practically, it happened. And sometimes, that's the Easter message.
[time=2216] But this morning, we're going to go a different route. There's the doctrinal side as well. What
[time=2222] do I mean by this? There is the very real, listen. There is the very real, absolutely true, biblical
[time=2228] realities and results, if you will. The big picture, spiritual implications of the resurrection
[time=2237] on you as it relates to him. Think of it this way. Practically, it happened.
[time=2243] Doctrineally, that it happened. That it happened means that there are some things, some very important
[time=2254] truths that are spiritually true for each of us, for all of time. There is, in the story of the
[time=2261] death and resurrection of our Lord, a body of principles and truth that we can believe,
[time=2267] that's what you do with doctrine. There's this body of truth, and you own it, you believe it, you give yourself to it, and it grows you, and it encourages you, and it emboldens you. The doctrine
[time=2279] this morning of the resurrection of our Lord. And I know there are those who think when they hear
[time=2285] doctrine, they think, "Oh, gee, this isn't going to be relevant." They think doctrine isn't as
[time=2292] applicable. They think maybe that somehow doctrine isn't as real, and I have been begging God
[time=2300] all week long. I have been begging him in this setting, in this moment, that he would, with you,
[time=2308] as you listen, and as you take this in this morning, that he would help you to see that there is a body of doctrinal theological truth surrounding the death and resurrection of our Lord that is
[time=2319] actually as relevant and real as the day is long, so real in fact that I believe, I believe in about
[time=2327] 20 minutes, the doctrinal truth surrounding the resurrection of Jesus will move many of you in
[time=2335] this room this morning to get up out of your seats and come forward and take part in something that
[time=2341] God has put on our hearts to do today that you will never forget for as long as you live.
[time=2347] So let's open up our Bibles, should we? To Romans chapter 6, the doctrine of the resurrection,
[time=2354] Romans 6, verses 3 to 7, and would you, in honor of God's Word, please stand as I read this to you
[time=2362] this this morning. Paul writes to the church at Rome in the sixth chapter, verse 3, he says,
[time=2369] "Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized
[time=2380] into his death. Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death so that as Christ
[time=2387] was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk."
[time=2393] Say it with me church out loud, "In newness of life, for if we have become united with him in the
[time=2401] likeness of his death, certainly we shall also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection,
[time=2410] knowing this, that our old self was crucified with him in order that our body of sin might be
[time=2418] done away with so that we would no longer, here comes Gomer, back into the picture so that we
[time=2425] would no longer be what, say it church, slaves to sin. For he who has died is what? Free.
[time=2436] For he who has died is freed from sin. Some things I want you to see here that affect you
[time=2443] and your relationship with him and your relationship to this day. Please have a seat. Point number one,
[time=2449] I want you to see it. I want you to understand it as best you can. It might stretch your mind, but it's good to have our minds stretch. You actually died with Christ. I want you to see
[time=2462] and understand this. You actually, if in fact you have placed your faith in him, if in fact you have
[time=2468] fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ, the spiritual doctrinal reality is that you died
[time=2477] with Christ. You see it there in verse three, or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized
[time=2483] into Christ Jesus have been baptized into his death. Now listen, here Paul uses the phrase
[time=2491] baptized metaphorically. He's not referring to water baptism, but he's painting a picture of this
[time=2500] unbelievable spiritual union. And immersion, think of baptism. He's painting a picture by the use of
[time=2511] this word, of this immersion, literally of you into Christ, Christ into you. It is thorough,
[time=2522] it is complete, it is whole, it is total. It's hard to even describe. It's why sometimes I sort
[time=2529] of, not a lot, but sometimes I sort of cringe at the idea of knowing him or having a relationship
[time=2536] with him. I understand those terms, but it's sometimes that undersells it. In salvation you have been
[time=2545] united at the deepest level with Christ. That's why we, that's why we encourage you to take this so
[time=2557] seriously. You're with him, he's with you. When you came to faith in Christ, the Scriptures teach
[time=2566] that you literally experience a joining together of Christ in you, you being identified with him.
[time=2574] How does Scripture describe this? Flip over if you would go, go past first and second Corinthians.
[time=2579] Let me hear those pages turning. Galatians, go to Galatians chapter three. Galatians chapter three,
[time=2586] I want to pick it up in verse 26. Galatians chapter three, verse 26, listen to the words of Paul.
[time=2593] He says, "For you, you who have come to faith in Christ, for you are all sons of God.
[time=2599] Through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were here it is, baptized into Christ,
[time=2607] have clothed, underlined that, circled that, have clothed yourself with Christ." The clothing of
[time=2616] yourself in Christ has gone so far that there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. Why? Watch this.
[time=2629] Why Jew or Greek? Why slave or free man? Why male or female? He uses these expressions.
[time=2637] These would be things that would be clearly seen as being like this. These are things that you read
[time=2645] that, those are things that, man, you got a man and you got a woman, you got a slave and you got a free man. I mean, there is no confusing that. They are distinct and separate. And he says, no,
[time=2656] the clothing of you in Christ encompasses you. It surrounds you. It engulfs you. You are draped.
[time=2672] In that day, clothing was from head to toe, covered everything. You are utterly covered
[time=2680] by Christ. You are in him. You are under him. You are surrounded by him. You are knit together
[time=2686] with him in Christ. And know this. Watch this. You want to blow your mind? Listen.
[time=2696] Know this. The union of Christ in you, you clothed in Christ. This didn't just happen
[time=2705] three months ago when you prayed that amazing prayer of repentance that Sunday morning. I mean,
[time=2712] I mean, it did, but it didn't. Let me explain. Guess when it happened? Guess when it really
[time=2720] happened? Look at Ephesians. Just go past Galatians. Go to Ephesians. Here's when it happened.
[time=2726] Look at Ephesians 1, 3, and 4. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=2732] who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ.
[time=2738] When? Just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world.
[time=2748] It happened forever ago. It happened before time began.
[time=2760] He was actually united with you then. He knew you then. He had you in his heart then.
[time=2767] Wow. So as a follower of Christ, I am in the doctrine of the resurrection. I am intimately
[time=2777] joined with Christ so that when he died, you died with him. I know, I know, I know. We often say that
[time=2791] it was Christ who died for our sins. We separate him and us in that picture. And I don't mean to
[time=2802] confuse you, but that's true. His death, his was the substitutionary death, literally, right? Amen?
[time=2813] Not your heads. I want to make sure I don't confuse anybody. Your sin should have hung
[time=2820] you on that cross. Literally, physically, he died in your place. At the same time though,
[time=2829] as we look at this from a spiritual perspective, at the same time, what we see here doctrinally
[time=2835] is that we were there. Our salvation, listen, here's the great truth of this. Our salvation, what Jesus did, isn't a passive, detached reality. It's not like it's over there.
[time=2846] No, when you come to faith in Christ, you and your body of sin died with him. But it doesn't end there.
[time=2859] Praise God. The doctrine of the resurrection goes on to say that second point, you were
[time=2865] indeed buried with him. It says it right there in verse 4. Go back to Romans 6. It says in Romans
[time=2873] chapter 6, verse 4, it says, "Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death."
[time=2882] I love this. I love this part. Let me ask you a question. Why the tomb?
[time=2891] Why be buried? I don't know if you've ever asked yourself that question. Don't know if it's ever
[time=2906] crossed your mind. If you're Christ, and you're there to do what God has you there to do,
[time=2913] why the tomb? Why not take your last breath on the cross, die, then hop down and get on with
[time=2925] what you came to do that would be miraculous. Why be buried? You know why? Because it was the
[time=2939] great setup for the great miracle. Because, listen, because everyone gets buried.
[time=2951] Everyone goes into the ground. The dead get put in tombs. Death leads to caskets,
[time=2960] right? And it was the last human common thing he did. Because while everyone ends up in a coffin,
[time=2973] nobody comes back. Nobody comes up out of the grave. No one defeats death. No one is resurrected
[time=2983] except Christ. And in this act, he is set up to establish himself and separate him from all others.
[time=2991] No one is resurrected except Christ. And don't miss it. According to the doctrine of the resurrection,
[time=3000] you, you were with him in the resurrection. You actually died with Christ. You were indeed
[time=3014] buried with Christ. And you were raised from the dead. Or you can be, depends on who you are this
[time=3025] morning, raised from the dead with Christ. Let's read about it. Go back to verse 4 of Romans 6,
[time=3032] therefore we have been buried with him. We died now. We're buried with him through baptism and to death. So that, here you go. As Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
[time=3043] Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if, verse 5, for if we have become
[time=3051] united with him in the likeness of his death and the doctrine of the resurrection teaches us this
[time=3057] morning that we have, for if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection. Knowing this, that our old self
[time=3069] was crucified with him in order that our body of sin might be done away with so that we would no
[time=3076] longer be gomer, so that we would no longer be unfaithful, so that we would no longer be enslaved
[time=3085] to sin. The doctrine of the resurrection, my friends, teaches us this morning. It proclaims
[time=3093] to us on this greatest of all Sundays that by placing your faith in Christ, you become
[time=3102] inextricably united with Christ in his resurrection, and what was dead now springs forward into,
[time=3111] what a great phrase, into newness of life. Oh, oh, what newness of life must have felt like
[time=3123] for gomer. Oh, what newness of life felt like for you. And for me, I remember that day.
[time=3134] I remember feeling and experiencing newness of life. It's called doctrinal term for you.
[time=3145] Don't be afraid of it. Write it down. It's called regeneration. You familiar with that phrase?
[time=3151] It's regeneration. It's when what is dead becomes alive.
[time=3162] Some of you know, others of you may not, over the last couple of years, we've had some,
[time=3169] we've had some foot surgeries in our family. One of our kids has had some struggles with a broken
[time=3176] bone in a foot, and it just wouldn't get well in another surgery, and it wouldn't get well and
[time=3184] fine. Never forget the day. This is great. Never forget the day the surgeon who's going to kind of
[time=3190] come in and try and really solve this problem comes in, tells me, says, "Mr. Bird, here's what we're going to do with this bone in this foot that just won't heal." He said, "The deal is the bone's dead."
[time=3204] He says, "I know you may not understand this." The bone's dead, he says. There's been no blood supply to the bone, so it's not going to heal. It's done. It'll always break. But what we're going
[time=3218] to do is this. He says, "We're going to go in and we're going to jam into his hip. We're going to
[time=3226] suck out from his hip, and it's going to hurt. It's painful, but the pain will bring good." He's
[time=3232] saying this to me. He says, "It's going to hurt. We're going to suck out all this bone marrow from the hip, and the bone marrow's filled with bone marrow that's alive. I'm going to bring all this
[time=3243] bone marrow over to this busted up dead bone. I'm going to drill hundreds of little holes all
[time=3249] around this bone break, and I'm going to take the syringe full of live bone marrow, and I'm going to
[time=3255] take it and insert it in there." And all that live bone marrow is going to seep into that dead bone,
[time=3262] and he says, "Guess what?" He says, "That bone's going to come back to life." He says, "No, I know
[time=3269] this is surgeon talk. Do you understand what I'm saying?" I said, "You got five minutes?"
[time=3276] It was amazing. He is describing what is for him in his world, regeneration, what is for you and I,
[time=3285] in our world, in this world, regeneration, it's what happens because of the resurrection.
[time=3293] What's dead is now alive, made new. What's the text say? Look at verse 6 again,
[time=3303] "That our old self was crucified with him, broken bones, in order that our body of sin might be
[time=3310] done away with, so that we no longer would be slaves to sin, for he, verse seven, for he who has died
[time=3318] is freed from sin, so that we would no longer be slaves. Chained up to brokenness and sin as
[time=3330] Corbin comes this morning, "Oh, I hope that you'll just consider this with me for just a few more moments here, so that we would no longer be slaves. Chained up to brokenness and sin.
[time=3343] My friends, the doctrine of the resurrection proclaims to you this morning to every single one of you,
[time=3350] the gospel, the good news." I remember being 20 years old sitting in the back right hand corner
[time=3359] of a huge church in Los Angeles, California, hearing Romans 7, 24, and 25 for the very first time.
[time=3366] Well, I may have heard it many times, but it was the first time I ever heard it.
[time=3371] Oh wretched man that I am. Who will save me from this body of death?
[time=3381] Praise be to God. It says, "Through Jesus Christ our Lord, the resurrected one,
[time=3390] the Redeemer, whoever you are this morning, whatever you've done, no matter how many times
[time=3398] you've done it, truth is you're just like Gomer. This room is filled with prostitutes.
[time=3408] This room is filled with unfaithful people who have rejected the faithful pursuit of a God whose
[time=3415] love is enduring and everlasting." You and I have been that unfaithful, and the resurrected
[time=3422] Lord shows up this morning as you stand on your auction block, and as you live daily,
[time=3431] with these chains that just weigh you down and strike at your hope and discourage your spirit,
[time=3438] buried in your sin. He shows up just like Jonathan did in that drama, and he says,
[time=3446] "I got him." He says, "I will," here's that word, "I will redeem you. I'll buy you back.
[time=3457] I'll pay the price to have you." Think about it. God says, "I'll pay the price to have you,
[time=3465] you with me," he says, "better yet," he says, "to have you in me, in my death, in my burial,
[time=3475] and in his what?" Resurrection. I'll buy you back, resurrected, regenerated, redeemed.
