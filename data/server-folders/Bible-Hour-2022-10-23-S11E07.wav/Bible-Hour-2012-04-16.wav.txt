[time=1083] Our Father in Heaven as we come to your life changing eternity altering word this morning
[time=1092] as we as a family come again to this place of worship where we open not only our Bibles but God
[time=1098] we open our hearts and our lives and our souls to you oh would you do what only you can do would
[time=1104] you work in us would you cause us to see things would you remind us of places where we need help
[time=1111] God would you bring conviction would you bring encouragement would you help us to be a people
[time=1117] willing to obey and follow these commands that you give us today and we'll thank you for it
[time=1123] and all the people agreed with the prayer and said amen maybe you saw him you can have a seat maybe
[time=1130] you saw him as we read I believe we can't experience the strength of God I believe we can't experience
[time=1138] the blessing of God I believe we become the people and the church of God that he designed
[time=1144] us to be when we stand firm let me just run through these real quick when we stand firm in the Lord
[time=1151] when we live in harmony with each other when we rejoice and reject anxiety when we pray and when we
[time=1160] dwell on God honoring things let's just jump in this morning with the first of the five and I'll tell you what as I looked at it this week I realized there were five week you could find six or seven
[time=1171] we're going to focus on five commands this week and so with five in mind I'm just throwing this out
[time=1177] to you can do with it what you will I think are are digging deeper curriculum this week we'll kind
[time=1183] of go in this direction even though you'll get it on Wednesday I want you to think about the five days of the week maybe maybe you would be willing this week to each day give thought to to each day
[time=1197] be mindful of to each day be prayerful about one of the five commands and we'll just go Monday
[time=1205] Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday so let's start in with what maybe you could give yourself to tomorrow
[time=1211] let's look at this first command found in Philippians 4-1 you can read it with me how I long to see
[time=1217] you my joy and crown in this way he says stand firm in the Lord command number one my friend
[time=1225] stand firm in the Lord really three very important parts to this command that any believer needs to
[time=1233] see and understand let's start with that first word stand stand spiritually he says to you this
[time=1243] morning stand don't sit stand up don't fall back stand don't relax stand don't chill no the word is
[time=1265] stand don't shrink back it talks about how there is no room for you or I in the day to day of our
[time=1273] relationship with God there's no room for us to spiritually coast and I want you just to think
[time=1280] with me this morning about your spiritual posture are you standing see to stand is to to stand is
[time=1288] to be ready it actually in the original language was a military term which had to do with being at
[time=1294] the ready it was standing a post see when he says stand firm in the Lord the stand has to do with
[time=1302] being sharp the stand has to do with being engaged the stand has to do with being alert
[time=1309] one of the younger ones in our home has a really tough time I know this isn't anything new
[time=1322] but this is like gone to new links one of the younger ones in our home has a really tough time getting out of bed in the morning and they're not like a bad kid it's just there's this there's this deal with this one where it's like you could bullhorn over their head and it's just tough to get him out of bed so we're just working on I'm working on it with him and it's and then there's this phrase that we kind of have landed on and it's been it's been working a little bit and we got to be patient and then you know we're trying to get there to be some response on the other end but I'll say hey are you up I'll say hey hey feet on the ground I'm just trying to get the feet on
[time=1356] the carpet does that make sense I think if I could just get the feet on the carpet we're making progress so literally I'll come in sometimes and the feet are on the carpet and the body's in bed but I want him to I want him to I want him to get up I want him to face it's time to face the day
[time=1377] it's not time to sit back it's not time to lay down it's time to stand what's your spiritual posture
[time=1385] today stand firm in the Lord let's look at that word firm the main idea here where it says stand
[time=1393] firm is to stand without wavering it means to stand without compromise it means to stand and to stand
[time=1402] solid to stand with conviction to stand with strength and I could go a number of different
[time=1412] places with this I can just tell you that if I talk to you about any number of three or four or five sports if we were talking about a number of different sports if we talked about the training for those sports if we were trying to coach kids and help them be better in those sports you name a sport almost all of them has to do with a strong and solid foundation whether you're talking about
[time=1434] basketball whether you're talking about football whether you're talking about baseball whether you're talking about volleyball nothing good happens when you're off balance nothing good happens
[time=1449] when you're not standing solid I can go away from sports to just memories of camps when I was a kid
[time=1459] participating in it or even watching it as a counselor or even as a parent going to lakes and
[time=1466] you see the you see the logs you know now they're inflated they used to be real uh the the inflated
[time=1473] logs and the kids they get on them and they spin each other and they have the batch the plastic things and they hit and you know and I know the ones that succeed are the ones that stand firm they're the ones that stand ready they're the ones that have a good base
[time=1488] nothing excellent ever happens with you or with me when we're not standing firm without
[time=1499] wavering without compromise what a beating what a what a beating the church has taken because we
[time=1511] say and proclaim one thing and then don't stand that way question for you what has
[time=1522] what has made you what has caused you to what has tempted you this week to waver in your standing what big inflatable bat has the enemy swung to somehow try and get you off
[time=1538] kilter seriously what is it what is it for you that you know in the in the in the depths of your
[time=1545] heart has the potential even again this week to cause you to waver to say things you shouldn't say
[time=1553] to go places you shouldn't go to think stuff you shouldn't think identify that see that this morning
[time=1561] right now in the in the honesty and quietness of your heart beg god right now to give you the
[time=1567] strength and courage to stand and to be firm in your stance he says stand firm oh i love the last
[time=1578] phrase here what in the who in the lord learn this years ago i'll say it to you this morning i've
[time=1586] i must have written it down a hundred times in my life it's just it's just right there i'm so grateful for those who deposited this truth in me when you want to be in the lord
[time=1597] do you want to be if you want to stand firm in the lord i hope you'll write this down then you
[time=1604] have to be in the word then you have to be in prayer then you have to be in the spirit
[time=1611] and you have to be in community in community i mean in relationship with others and i don't mean
[time=1621] hey how you doing relationship i mean there's got to be in your life
[time=1627] somewhere a few who live with you at a level of relationship where there is no hiddenness
[time=1637] where there is no secretness where there is nothing but absolute total authenticity
[time=1645] vulnerability and transparency see we will function and stand in the lord
[time=1651] when that stance is bathed in the word in prayer in the spirit in community
[time=1661] stand firm in the lord first command here in philippians four what a great few thoughts for
[time=1673] us to hold on to as you would come to your monday tomorrow i hope you'll dwell on that i hope you'll
[time=1679] read these verses again i hope you'll pray tomorrow morning oh god give me the courage and strength to stand firm in the lord tuesday command number two here we go it says right there
[time=1690] in verse two i don't know if you picked it up he was urging those two gals whose names i haven't
[time=1697] read the same in twenty four years of ministry he said to them he said i urge these gals to what
[time=1704] live in what say it harmony to live in harmony he says to you and i this morning my friends live
[time=1712] in harmony live in unity live together do not let anything come in between you and your relationships
[time=1724] because it is so very important that we would as a family live together well this one is real
[time=1732] simple my friends we make god i believe this with all my heart i've seen it in twenty four years of ministry i've seen it in forty nine years of living we make god his great gospel and the church
[time=1744] look bad when we destroy each other when we detach from each other and create disunity
[time=1751] why how because because listen because our gossip about each other because our fighting
[time=1760] with each other because our leaving each other because our lack of grace with each other our
[time=1766] disputing with each other shows the absence of the one quality that's truly supposed to distinguish us
[time=1776] from the world it's the whole ball game the whole ball game is that he has us here as the body of
[time=1783] christ to to live in such a way yes with them but also with each other that distinguishes us a
[time=1790] holy nation separate and different there's to be this quality about us that makes them look at us
[time=1798] and go wait a minute they're all humans they're all people just like us and yet they they will
[time=1806] know we are christians by our love they love each other they say they they on the sides looking in
[time=1815] going it's amazing they it's like they're weird they just love each other it's endless you wouldn't
[time=1824] believe the things that they're doing for each other in that place but no we bicker and we fight
[time=1833] and we fracture and we hold grudges and we say stuff we shouldn't say
[time=1843] live in harmony command number two literally means the phrase literally means be of the same mind
[time=1851] be of the same mind who's mind yours no christs forget your mind forget mind it's not about you
[time=1863] being like me or me being like you it's about us being like who him be of the same mind
[time=1871] and we can't last thing here on this one we can't do that if there's something in between you and me
[time=1879] if i've done something to offend you if you've done something to hurt me if you heard i said
[time=1887] something if something's gone down in weeks or months or heaven forbid you know years whatever
[time=1893] it might be believe me if there's something in the way and it's a day old or ten years old it's
[time=1899] going to divide this thing called a family it's going to hinder our effectiveness
[time=1905] and diminish the work of god in this place if there's anything that's not right
[time=1914] between us if there's anything wrong i hope to god you'll make it right with whoever
[time=1926] you might need to make it right with whether it's little you know we're big say something
[time=1932] command number three move on to wednesday maybe on wednesday you can be thinking about
[time=1939] mulling over praying about meditating on this one you probably saw it right there in verse four verse four five little bit of six rejoice in the lord always again i will say rejoice it's in the
[time=1952] imperative it's a command the lord is near be anxious for nothing closely connected so we've
[time=1959] connected them into one here but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your request be made known to god rejoice don't be anxious rejoice reject anxiety let's start
[time=1971] with the first part of this command rejoice i want you to really i want you to look and see here how this is worded i want you to look at the grammar of this please understand that you are
[time=1982] being told to rejoice really you are being told he's saying this to you hey christian be joyful
[time=1997] be joyful he is saying to you i'll go a little further choose to be joyful
[time=2006] and i'm saying it to you this morning the word of god to you this morning is choose joyfulness
[time=2013] be joyful and so many times what i see back in your eyes so many times what i hear back in the
[time=2022] honest conversation is you're going i'd like to be i mean i want to be you say but then you look
[time=2028] at me and you say have you seen my life i mean do you know what's going on with me do you have any idea what i'm facing i'd like to be and see that's where i want to help you understand your confusing
[time=2040] joyfulness which has no conditions joyfulness is not tied to your circumstance
[time=2049] feelings are tied to your circumstance you hear me i know you might be sad i know you might be
[time=2059] bummed i know there might be a lot of things going on no listen don't confuse joyfulness with feelings joy is connected to god feelings are connected to circumstances and people
[time=2072] here's the definition that will help you make even better sense of this a definition of joy
[time=2078] for you is this it's a deep inner reality it is a deep inner sense of confidence that a loving
[time=2085] heavenly father is thoughtfully and with purpose underline those thoughtfully and with purpose
[time=2093] ordering or orchestrating the events of your life that is joy the reality of that phrase
[time=2102] that statement right there and you owning that you believing that you claiming that to be true
[time=2110] and then living and choosing in the way you talk and the way you look and the way you carry yourself
[time=2118] you choosing to go forward in light of that that's joy that's joy joy is connected to god
[time=2128] feelings are connected to circumstances and people you say how in the world okay i see
[time=2137] the definition kelly i see the phrase hey that that's huge it's powerful it makes sense how how can i do that and i want to just remind you that at the very core of that statement at the
[time=2148] very core of that definition i just want to remind you that you can do it because what you're placing
[time=2155] your trust in that which you're placing your faith in is god it's god i mean it's god god
[time=2168] who isn't far away or detached but no who is Emmanuel who is within near you and he is thoughtfully
[time=2175] and with purpose not randomly and out of nowhere no with great purpose and thought he's
[time=2183] orchestrating the events of your life and you can trust him you can't trust me you can't trust
[time=2189] people you can't trust circumstances but you can trust him amen i get reminded of this i get the
[time=2198] joy as many of you do of seeing this lived out in this family i get to watch as my good and
[time=2207] dear friend jan van till goes through her days nowadays fighting cancer i watch her i was talking
[time=2216] to jack this morning as the effects of radiation are starting to set in and as i talk with her and
[time=2222] as i hear her voice all i hear all i sense all she ever says is how thankful she is for the love of god
[time=2230] for the way in which he is holding her up the way in which he is strengthening her
[time=2236] all she ever wants to talk about is me and my family and our needs in this place and there she
[time=2242] sits going through the brutal reality of that ugly disease with nothing but joy
[time=2250] a deep inner confidence that a loving heavenly father is thoughtfully and with purpose
[time=2256] orchestrating the events of her life i feel the same thing i hear the same words i get the same
[time=2262] sense when i talk with my good friend many of you know him well he's been here he's preached our churches are friends luther witfield going through cancer these days radiation chemo the
[time=2274] whole nine yards it's taken its toll and you get luther on the phone i love hearing his voice
[time=2280] and his voice has changed a bit but his spirit hasn't giving himself daily moment by moment
[time=2290] to the great love and grace of god as he faces a very uncertain physical reality
[time=2297] with a very certain spiritual strength amen i was thinking about it drop by saturday yesterday
[time=2306] just to pray with corbin and tanya and the girls wanted to see him one more time before they got on the plane and left and as i was driving away from the miller as i just thought about their their year i thought about them losing zoei thought about just the reality of them realizing that
[time=2323] they were going to give birth to a little girl that wasn't going to live in the way they faced that the way they walked through that the way they've walked since that and i thought about the joy that god has given them
[time=2340] because it's god you don't have to be scared and i wonder i said at first hour and i wonder even
[time=2349] second hour i wonder how many people in this room this morning right now are scared i don't know what all of you are facing i don't know what all of you are going through but i would imagine that there are some in this room this morning and you're just flat out scared
[time=2365] and he says here have have anxiety about nothing have anxiety about nothing well what's anxiety
[time=2376] be anxious for nothing what's that word mean that word means a deep consuming fear regarding a what
[time=2383] say a future unknown anybody got any future unknowns running around inside your life
[time=2392] in your head and heart this morning i bet there is and the point here is this it's a deep consuming fear regarding a future unknown and god through the pin of paul says to
[time=2402] you don't have any don't have anything to do with it no choose a different tact
[time=2409] but don't allow yourself to be afraid there is nothing i want you to i want you to write
[time=2417] this down if you can it won't be on the screen so i'll say it slowly there is no future unknown that can in any way come in between you and god's best for you
[time=2429] and if you believe that like really truly believe that and if you're willing to live then
[time=2439] choosing your attitude and your words and the way you carry yourself based upon that it makes all the difference in the world you're filled with joy
[time=2450] there is no future unknown that can in any way come in between you and god's best for you he is not thoughtless he is thoughtful and with purpose he is orchestrating
[time=2462] everything in your life hey quick question for you those of you who maybe have some familiarity with
[time=2469] the scriptures some of us not all of us but we've been hearing stories from this amazing history
[time=2475] of redemption from the day we were born others of us have had the privilege of bible studies or
[time=2481] classes or even a college education that had a christian bent who in here as you think about the
[time=2489] stories of the bible who like in the old testament let's say who comes to your mind old testament
[time=2499] that stood there and faced like oh my goodness this could be really really bad oh my word
[time=2508] this is this could be awful who faced that with a great sense of joy inner confidence that a
[time=2518] loving heavenly father is thoughtfully and with purpose orchestrating these events so i'm gonna be
[time=2527] okay i'm gonna be all right here joseph ester daniel jobe abraham married
[time=2540] joshua these are great stories jobe are you kidding me me he was on the fence there for a
[time=2551] little bit but at the end of the day he found a little joy got things dialed in
[time=2557] abraham absolutely joshua wow somebody said daniel i wrote down i just i wrote down and i love
[time=2570] this story i've said it before i said it for years if ever i had like a bunch of cash if i ever had like ten million dollars probably i probably need more i would pay to have this i would pay to have
[time=2581] the story of shadrach michak and abednego made into a movie like big screen you with me i would
[time=2589] love to see the truth from go ahead and turn there i tried to just talk about it first hour without
[time=2596] turning there i couldn't do it go to daniel three after he's ekeel after he's ekeel comes daniel
[time=2604] go to daniel three i just want you to see this joy this deep inner confidence that a loving heavenly father is thoughtfully and with purpose orchestrating these events so that means i can
[time=2615] stand in the midst of this and i am all right daniel three sixteen now nevica nesser you know
[time=2624] nevica nesser those of you who know the story know that this guy is like hitler i mean he's like sadam who's saying this guy is the whacked crazed leader of these days these times and he is
[time=2636] down on a rampage because he is demanding the worship of the people here these chewyish boys
[time=2643] taking captive fifteen hundred miles away from home thirteen fourteen fifteen years of age and he's
[time=2650] wagging his ring in their face saying when that music plays you will bow down to this image
[time=2658] the statue that i have built in these boys see they had a little they've had a little teaching
[time=2664] these boys somewhere back in jerusalem had some really good parents who taught them the law and
[time=2672] the love for god and at thirteen fourteen fifteen a long way away from home where nobody would have
[time=2678] ever known with their lives in danger because he said if you don't i'm gonna burn you alive
[time=2684] i'm gonna heat the furnace seven times it's normal heat i'm gonna throw you in and you're gonna fry and i've always from the day i read this i can't get through it without just imagining
[time=2697] how they said these words so pardon me if i take some liberty i just believe in my heart that this
[time=2706] is how they said it is that okay shadrach michak and abendigo replied to the king oh nevica nesser
[time=2715] we do not need to give you an answer concerning this manner because you know why if it be so
[time=2724] our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire and he will
[time=2735] nevica nesser look at me i'm talking to you i know it doesn't say that but i guess i see it it just comes to my mind he says and he will deliver us out of your hand oh king
[time=2748] but even if he does not let it be known to you oh king that we are not going to serve your gods
[time=2760] or worship the golden image that you have set up so throw us in the fire go ahead
[time=2768] we're all right because either way did you hear that either way he orchestrates with thought and purpose that which is best for me
[time=2779] either way he says we're gonna be we're gonna be fine so there is no fear it's no room paul says there's no room for fear don't be anxious
[time=2796] there is no future unknown that can come in between you and god's best for you no fear rejoice
[time=2807] i told first hour i'm driving in this morning and i know this that dates me it's gonna make me
[time=2815] look old and it's gonna embarrass my kids but i'm driving in this morning by myself i'm thinking

[time=2898] that comes without people on their knees fallipians four let's go back to verse six be anxious for
[time=2907] nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication and i want to just stop there first thing go
[time=2916] back to that word everything i want to just free you up i want to give you permission this morning because people ask me about this they sometimes wonder if the in everything is that just jan and
[time=2926] luther is that just corbin and tanya or can i bring can i bring the things that are on my heart can i
[time=2935] bring the the little stuff maybe that's getting in my way can i let me just tell you be anxious for
[time=2943] nothing but in what say it everything whoever you are whatever it looks like you get the privilege
[time=2952] of knowing today that you can bring everything to him by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving
[time=2960] let your requests be made known to god and the peace of god oh i'm so grateful for verse seven
[time=2967] and the peace of god which surpasses all comprehension which goes beyond all understanding
[time=2973] humanly speaking humanly you know what that means right beyond comprehension humanly speaking the peace of god in the midst of what we've been talking about today
[time=2985] humanly speaking when they look at us in the midst of whatever it is we're facing
[time=2991] the peace of god in the midst of that makes no sense beyond comprehension it just shouldn't be
[time=3002] but it is because he's god will guard your hearts and your minds in christ Jesus
[time=3014] this got given me years ago as well it's been my privilege to just pass this along over the years
[time=3022] i'll pass it along to you this morning do you want to be what does it say there
[time=3032] but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god i want you to i want you to understand what it means in three parts to pray and it breaks
[time=3046] it down for you right here in the text i want you just to write down three things i want you to write
[time=3052] down pray i want you to write down supplicate and i want you to write down thanks
[time=3061] there is an umbrella of prayer if you will broken down into three components and it's so important that as you come to him with joy instead of anxiety making known to him the things that
[time=3074] are going on in your life that you would engage yourself in these three things because at the end of these three things is the peace that surpasses all understanding pray this phrase pray here
[time=3087] simply means and i don't mean to diminish it in any way but in this context it means that you're simply coming to god you're willing in whatever it is you're facing to stop going to him
[time=3100] stop going to her stop going to it stop going to them this means you've now decided to come to
[time=3108] capital h i m amen and you and i both know how difficult it is sometimes to humble ourselves
[time=3118] and stop going to all of them and all of that and all of this and just say okay that's it god i am coming to you pray you see it there in the text be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer
[time=3133] and supplication so pray is i'm coming to you god supplicate is the word means it's great it means
[time=3141] to ask and it means to ask specifically it means to be absolutely clear with what it is you're asking
[time=3152] for you're coming before him and you're sharing with him the desire of your heart oh god if it would
[time=3159] be your will please i am asking that you would move in this way and some say well gosh i hate
[time=3167] doing that because it might not happen and i say whoa whoa wait a minute there's nothing that can
[time=3174] come in between you and him and his best for you so whatever happens is good but there's still the
[time=3183] freedom and there's still the opportunity for you and i to come and ask that which is on our hearts
[time=3189] he's a good god he listens and he hears pray i come to you god supplicate i'm asking god for help
[time=3197] thanks and this is the key i'm thanking god in advance can you do that
[time=3203] see this is this is where it really gets interesting can you with this issue i mean this thing that
[time=3212] means so much to you can you say oh god if it be your will this is what i oh god i hope this could
[time=3218] happen and then can you in the next breath say and i thank you in advance for whatever it is you

[time=3439] today are starting to take steps to dwell on good things men and women who are so tired
[time=3445] and so weary of their failure and their sin that they are actually starting to do things that would
[time=3452] blow your mind when it comes to their willingness and their readiness to finally be done and walk
[time=3459] away from be done establish new patterns of obedience it's amazing to see what people are
[time=3467] willing to do when in their heart and soul they're finally to that point where they want nothing more
