[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well good morning again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It's great to be with you.
[time=35] I'm so thankful that we get a few minutes like this each and every week if you're tuning in for the first time, allow me the privilege of introducing myself to you.
[time=44] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the honor of serving on the team here at Blackhawk Ministries as the senior pastor and each and every week we have the honor of bringing to you those of you in our broadcast audience what took place on Sunday morning right here at Blackhawk as we gather at nine and 1045 each and every week.
[time=64] We're in a series on the book of Philippians and what you're gonna see today is actually the last message in our study of Philippians.
[time=71] And in this last section Paul deals with a very, very important topic.
[time=75] It's a topic that really speaks to the every day of your life and mine.
[time=80] It is a principle, it is an issue that I know I have struggled with for years.
[time=86] And I thank God that he continues to grow me in it but I know there is a lot of work still to be done on this front and the front that I'm referring to.
[time=95] This issue we look at today is the topic of contentment.
[time=99] That's right, contentment.
[time=101] I think a lot of times people think of money or finances, resources when we think of contentment.
[time=107] I want you to think about it today though, contentment really isn't just about paychecks and the size of your home.
[time=113] It's about also life circumstances.
[time=116] It's about what God allows.
[time=118] It's about what you're facing.
[time=120] And as we look at circumstance and provision, God's circumstance and provision, that which he allows for you, there is a great truth today in this passage that you can be in the midst of whatever you face, content.
[time=134] That's right, there can be a deep sense of satisfaction in you regardless of physical surroundings.
[time=140] And I can't wait for you to see what God's word has to say.
[time=144] Hey, we're thankful for you.
[time=145] Thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=147] Thankful that you're a part of our family by virtue of being out there in the broadcast audience.
[time=152] We want you to know that as always, we would love to meet you face to face.
[time=156] We'd love to get to know you.
[time=158] We'd love to help you find a place in this family here at Blackhawk and please come by on Sunday morning.
[time=164] Please come by during the week, email us, just contact us and let us know that you're out there.
[time=170] We'd love to meet you and come alongside as best we can.
[time=173] Hey, God bless you.
[time=174] Thanks for tuning in.
[time=176] And as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=361] - Hey, would you open your Bibles this morning, please,
[time=371] to Philippians chapter four.
[time=374] Philippians chapter four, we come today to the end of our study of Philippians.
[time=378] What a great study it has been.
[time=380] We have been encouraged and we have been challenged with what Paul has had to share to the church at Philippi and to us as well.
[time=387] And this morning, I think it doesn't get any more practical, it doesn't get any more significant, it doesn't get any more important than the truth that we're gonna get to interact with today.
[time=399] The resource, the source of contentment, Philippians four, verses 10 through 20, let me start this morning by asking you a question, have you ever been around someone who had it all?
[time=411] You ever been around somebody who had it all?
[time=415] Do you know that guy?
[time=420] You've been around that family?
[time=422] I mean, the fact of the matter is it just seems as if as you spend time with them and you're around them and they may make it obvious or it might be subtle, but either way, they just have it all.
[time=432] Someone who clearly has compiled enormous resources, tons of toys, all the stuff, amazing trips, huge house, top of the line clothes, everything.
[time=444] You ever been around that guy?
[time=445] And sensed from him or better yet sensed in him
[time=452] that in spite of all he possessed,
[time=458] it just wasn't what?
[time=459] Enough.
[time=463] He's stingy, it's uptight, he's rude, demanding, always reaching for more.
[time=478] This maybe is how you might describe that guy or that gal.
[time=485] There's another question for you, have you ever been around the guy who didn't have anything?
[time=490] Have you ever been around the guy who didn't have a thing?
[time=493] Or the gal?
[time=494] Nothing, didn't try the nice car, doesn't have the newest stuff, no toys, doesn't travel to luxurious destinations, doesn't have any of that stuff.
[time=505] And in light of not having any of that stuff, this guy, he's angry.
[time=511] Been around, you've been around that guy?
[time=515] He's just ticked all the time.
[time=520] Seems like he's always upset.
[time=524] You listen to him talk and it's like, why couldn't he ever get lucky?
[time=528] You listen to him talk and it's like, it's always the other people's fault.
[time=532] There's this bitterness and there's anger in him, under-resourced and bitter.
[time=539] Both of these guys, this morning, examples for you and for me, both scenarios exposing a lack of what we wanna talk about this morning and where our passage takes us.
[time=558] It's a word that starts with C and it's called contentment.
[time=562] Contentment.
[time=566] How content are you this morning?
[time=571] Somebody once said, I love this, when you can think of yesterday without regret.
[time=578] And when you can think of tomorrow without fear, you are nearer to contentment.
[time=584] Think about that when you can think of yesterday without regret and tomorrow without fear, you aren't there, you are nearer to contentment, which helps us again this morning realize and be reminded of, I think, the great truth, that contentment is a tough one.
[time=599] Contentment isn't something that most of us can just grab in a moment.
[time=607] I love what Jonathan Edwards said, he said contentment is a pursuit not quickly nor readily befriended.
[time=616] That won't be on your screen, but I'll say it again if you wanna write it down, contentment is a pursuit not quickly or readily befriended.
[time=624] The definition of contentment, I hope you'll write this down as well, contentment is the state of being, it is the state of being at peace with both circumstance and provision.
[time=637] It is to be truly satisfied.
[time=640] And I want you to underline, if you wrote that down, just go back and underline circumstance and provision.
[time=647] Because a lot of times, not always, but a lot of times when we start talking about contentment, a lot of times if I ask you, "Hey, are you content these days?" A lot of times, even my opening questions took us to the financial side.
[time=661] It took us to the resource side of this issue.
[time=664] It took us to the provision side of our definition.
[time=668] And while provision, resource, bottom line, your checkbook or mine, where we go, what we own, while that comes into the discussion of contentment, don't forget about circumstance.
[time=679] Because whether it's circumstance or provision, what you'll hear me say today, and what I believe the word of God teaches us is that God is behind both.
[time=694] The state of being at peace, with both circumstance and provision.
[time=700] It is to be truly satisfied.
[time=702] And for the Christian, those of you in the room, who have fully surrendered your heart and lives to Christ.
[time=708] For the Christian, it goes even further.
[time=710] Our contentment, our satisfaction, and being at peace with both circumstance and provision, you see for us, it goes beyond just a positive mental attitude.
[time=725] The contentment of a believer is, in fact, rooted in the character of God.
[time=731] The degree to which you will be an experienced contentment is directly related to your understanding and your belief in the character of God.
[time=742] In the absolute, in this case, in the absolute goodness of God, the goodness of God and your contentment, utterly and absolutely and inextricably linked.
[time=755] Well, what do I mean?
[time=757] What I mean is this, Christians believe, Christians believe deep in their hearts and souls that God is good.
[time=766] If you know Him, if you walk with Him, if He's the one that you follow, you have a belief down deep in your heart that He is good, Psalm 31.
[time=777] Psalm 31 19, I hope you'll just put an asterisk by it.
[time=781] I hope you'll remember it, Psalm 31 19.
[time=784] It says this, it says, "How great, great, how big,
[time=793] "how wide, how awesome, how great is your goodness, "goodness which you have stored up for those who fear you, "which you have wrought for those who take refuge in you, "how great is your goodness.
[time=810] "We as believers have a deep-seated understanding "that our God by nature of His character is good.
[time=816] "No good thing will He withhold," the Bible tells us.
[time=821] And whatever He allows, this will start to sound like last week, but bear with me here, whatever He allows on the provision front, whether excess or the lack thereof, you and I can be faithful, humble, and we can say because of our belief in Him and our understanding of His character, as the provision comes, whatever that is, we can say what I say, and maybe you say it, when I'm at a restaurant, and I've been there for about two hours, and I've been having a great time, and I'm done, and she comes and she says, "What else can I get for you?" And I say, "Thank you, I'm good."
[time=868] Say, "I'm good." "I'm good." Say it louder.
[time=873] "I'm good." You're good.
[time=875] You've been provided for.
[time=877] You've taken in.
[time=878] It is what it is.
[time=881] It's what was on the plate, right?
[time=883] He provides.
[time=885] He provides morning, noon, and night.
[time=888] He is an office throne.
[time=891] Nothing got by Him.
[time=893] There are no mistakes.
[time=895] Say it again.
[time=900] I'm good.
[time=902] You and I can say, "I'm good," because God's good.
[time=906] It's not mean.
[time=907] He's not unfair.
[time=909] He's not slow.
[time=910] He's good.
[time=912] Psalm 119, it's really short and simple.
[time=915] Again, I hope you'll write this down.
[time=918] Psalm 119 verse 68.
[time=922] Look at what it says.
[time=923] Psalm 119, turn there in your Bibles.
[time=925] I want you to see this.
[time=927] Psalm 119, 68, talking about the goodness of God.
[time=931] You are Psalm 119, 68.
[time=933] You are good, and you do good.
[time=937] This is the proclamation of the Psalmist.
[time=942] Here in Psalm 119, 68.
[time=944] You are good, and do good.
[time=948] That's who our God is.
[time=950] That's how He functions.
[time=952] That's what's behind His activity with and toward us.
[time=955] He is good, and He does good, amen?
[time=959] All right, Philippians 4.
[time=960] Let's look at 10 to 14.
[time=962] And would you, in honor of God's word, would you stand?
[time=965] And let me read this to you this morning.
[time=966] Philippians 4, 10 to 14.
[time=969] But I rejoiced, Paul says.
[time=974] There's that word again, joy.
[time=976] But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last you have received your concern.
[time=982] You have revived your concern for me.
[time=985] Indeed, you were concerned before, but you lacked opportunity.
[time=989] The Philippians have done something for Paul, and we're gonna see that a little bit later in the passage.
[time=995] But you lacked opportunity, verse 11, not that I speak from what?
[time=1003] For I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.
[time=1008] I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity.
[time=1014] In any and every circumstance, I have learned that the secret of being fulfilled, I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry.
[time=1026] He's learned the secret, both of having abundance and suffering need.
[time=1031] What is that secret?
[time=1033] I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.
[time=1039] Nevertheless, verse 14, you have done well to share with me in my affliction.
[time=1045] Let me pray for us this morning.
[time=1046] Our Father, God, as we come to this topic, as we come to this passage, as we come to this great truth that affects so many of us.
[time=1055] Oh God, I pray that you would, and your spirit would, and your word would penetrate into places where we need to be corrected, where we need to be reminded, oh God, where we need your comfort and help.
[time=1068] Would you do that this morning?
[time=1069] In your son's name we pray, amen, before you sit down.
[time=1074] I wanna just give you an opportunity, it won't take long.
[time=1082] And really, it's okay to think this one through, and however you go on this one, it's okay, it is, but I just wanna give you the chance.
[time=1090] If this morning, you can already sense in your heart and life wherever you're living today, whatever's going on today.
[time=1099] And here's the great thing about getting to be with you guys for as long as I've gotten to be with you guys.
[time=1103] They get the privilege and joy, and it really is of knowing you.
[time=1106] And I know there's a lot of you this morning who need this.
[time=1111] I stand with you.
[time=1112] And I'm gonna just ask everybody to have a seat, but this morning, if you really, really know already that you need an extra dose of this truth in your life, I'm gonna invite you to stay standing just for a moment.
[time=1127] You can be seated or you can stay standing.
[time=1131] And I'm gonna just pray, Father God, for those who are standing this morning as we think about contentment, as we think about our lives and where they are today and what we're facing and what we have or what we don't have, God, what we need or at least we think we need, and where you are in the midst of all of that.
[time=1151] Oh God, I pray that you would minister to those who stand this morning in their honesty and authenticity.
[time=1158] They stand saying, "We need your help, God." And so I pray you would bring it in your son's name.
[time=1164] We pray, amen, you can be seated.
[time=1166] Four things I wanna show you this morning.
[time=1169] Four truths to take home regarding contentment.
[time=1177] You ready?
[time=1178] So number one, it is learned.
[time=1182] Contentment, my friends, is learned.
[time=1186] The phrase, the concept of something being learned, it assumes a process.
[time=1192] It assumes a period of time.
[time=1195] Contentment isn't something that you just get.
[time=1197] Contentment is something that you learn.
[time=1201] It's an interesting thought.
[time=1204] You're not as content as you know you should be.
[time=1208] Somebody once said there's always later this afternoon.
[time=1211] You're always gonna get to work on this.
[time=1214] You're always gonna be faced with this.
[time=1215] This is never going away.
[time=1217] You will and I will face circumstances again and again and again that force us to deal with the truth regarding contentment.
[time=1225] A.W. Tozer said, "This won't be on the screen.
[time=1228] "Write it down.
[time=1229] "I'll try and say it's low.
[time=1230] "It's so profound and so true." Tozer said, "True contentment is too often distant "from our youth.
[time=1238] "True contentment is too often distant from our youth.
[time=1242] "It is something much more familiar to our years "and to our toil." And I'm not saying that 17-year-olds can't be content.
[time=1252] I'm saying it's really, really hard sometimes for a 17-year-old to be content.
[time=1258] It's tough sometimes in our youthfulness to truly grasp the principles around contentment as you turn 27 and as 27 turns to 37 and as 37 turns to 47.
[time=1273] And I don't wanna think about what comes after 47.
[time=1276] You all know what I mean.
[time=1279] Not your heads.
[time=1281] There is something about age.
[time=1283] There is something about experience.
[time=1285] There is something about walking with God through life over time that instills in you this even deeper and greater desire, this ability to really be at peace.
[time=1299] It's a really, really interesting thought.
[time=1301] I'm not trying to say to you young people, "Hey, it's hopeless." I'm saying, "Hang in there." I'm saying, "Walk with him over some years.
[time=1310] "Be faithful to him over time "and this idea of contentment will become "much, much more of a friend." But I wanna just remind you this morning that it's learned.
[time=1323] I wanna remind you this morning that it's learned through the experiences of our life.
[time=1328] And you know me, I'm not a great artist, but I hope you can see this.
[time=1334] If you can't, you can hear me and we can kind of talk it through.
[time=1339] You guys aren't gonna be able to see too well.
[time=1342] But I see if I help you, then I kind of hose them.
[time=1344] So we'll just kind of leave it like that.
[time=1348] Here's the deal.
[time=1349] I drew a picture of the umbrella, if you will, this is the umbrella of God's provision for us in our lives.
[time=1357] Not a great picture, but it's, you know, there you go.
[time=1359] This is the umbrella of God over us.
[time=1362] Now in the conversation about provision, especially as it relates to what you have or what you don't have, what's coming in or what's not, I do wanna always just add a little caveat over here.
[time=1375] It's called, read that, what's it say?
[time=1378] Hard work.
[time=1379] I really get bothered, side note.
[time=1380] I get bothered when people who don't work, people who don't try to work.
[time=1385] I get bothered when people who don't try to work come and wanna complain about its provisions.
[time=1391] Does that make sense?
[time=1392] Bible makes it really clear.
[time=1394] Say it again.
[time=1395] Work hard.
[time=1398] Do something.
[time=1399] There really is something of value in doing something, in the effort that you and I give toward hard work.
[time=1406] Hard work, God's provision.
[time=1408] So you couple that and down it comes.
[time=1411] Whatever it is, wherever it lands, down comes the provision.
[time=1415] So here's what I do on this one.
[time=1417] I draw a guy over here kind of down on this end.
[time=1421] Yeah, and this end is the, this end is the, it's the minus end.
[time=1425] It's not so good for that guy.
[time=1427] Circumstantially and provision.
[time=1429] Doesn't have much.
[time=1431] Wondering what's wrong.
[time=1432] Wondering what he's gonna do.
[time=1433] Wondering how he's gonna make it work.
[time=1436] All the while, kind of, he's got these, he's got these things called eyes.
[time=1440] And so he can see what's going on down here.
[time=1442] So then he gets jealous, then he gets bitter.
[time=1444] You know what this guy gets?
[time=1445] If he's not careful, if he's not cautious, if he doesn't exercise wisdom, this guy, I've seen it day after day, year after year.
[time=1452] This guy gets depressed.
[time=1454] This guy gets bitter.
[time=1458] This guy gets angry.
[time=1461] Right there.
[time=1462] Minus end of the spectrum.
[time=1464] God's provision has come.
[time=1466] It looks like what it looks like.
[time=1467] And he's down there going, what in the world is going on?
[time=1470] And I have seen, I'll say this, in my life, I have seen the results of depressed, bitter, angry living.
[time=1484] I've watched you live bitter, angry, depressed lives at times.
[time=1493] And guess what, I've learned, what I've learned is that when that's where we are, we're lousy spouses, we're lousy parents, we're lousy workers, we're lousy followers of Christ, we're lousy.
[time=1506] Nothing good comes from that.
[time=1509] And thank God, because of God and others who have helped me
[time=1515] and thank God for those who have come alongside you, many of you have learned that this isn't gonna work.
[time=1522] And then you got this end over here, 'cause you got some people living in abundance, you know?
[time=1529] Yeah, they worked hard.
[time=1531] But those of you who are in abundance and who worked hard, be careful there.
[time=1535] Don't get too happy with yourself.
[time=1537] 'Cause this is the deal right here.
[time=1540] God's provision, in your situation, for some reason, you got a whole bunch.
[time=1546] And here I talked about it earlier, what happens if we don't exercise wisdom here is oftentimes this guy ends up being selfish, this guy ends up being arrogant, and this guy ends up being prideful.
[time=1561] I mean, this guy's a real peach, these are real gem.
[time=1566] Nobody wants to be around him, nobody wants to be in relationship with him, he makes a lousy spouse, he makes a lousy father, he makes a lousy mom, they make lousy followers of Christ, they're just lousy.
[time=1582] And hopefully, you've had somebody come alongside you and help you understand, they've helped you learn that this isn't where you want to live, and they've helped you learn that this isn't where you want to live.
[time=1596] And guess what?
[time=1598] Bad picture here, I didn't leave my space.
[time=1600] Guess what, there's this place in the middle, it's called content.
[time=1604] There's this place in the middle called contentment where you can, what did Paul say?
[time=1610] It's right there in the passage.
[time=1611] You can have either, you can be loaded, you can have nothing, you can be in prosperity, you can be in humble needs.
[time=1620] There is a place in your life where you can live content because of the character of God, not the balance on your portfolio.
[time=1633] Does this make sense?
[time=1635] Wow, this is a good truth.
[time=1636] Are you learning?
[time=1639] Have you learned that?
[time=1641] Are you exercising?
[time=1642] Are you applying what you've learned and moving more and more toward this place of contentment?
[time=1648] I kind of let the cat out of the bag, but I'll say this, number two, it's like joy.
[time=1653] It's learned, number one, it is also like joy.
[time=1657] And what I mean is I'm referring back to last week, and I'm telling you this morning that like joy, contentment is not circumstantial.
[time=1667] Then some of you are gonna go, "Well, wait a minute, okay?" I gave you the benefit of the doubt on the joy thing, not being circumstantial, but how can you stand here and tell me that contentment, as it relates to circumstance and provision, where my life's at and my check, how can you tell me contentment's not circumstantial?
[time=1687] Well, I've already told you, I wanna tell you again, look what it says in verse 12.
[time=1693] I know how to get along with humble means.
[time=1695] I also know how to live in prosperity in any, there it is.
[time=1699] In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, Paul right there, just blows the circumstance thing out of the bag because he tells you he's learned how to do both.
[time=1714] So it's clearly not circumstantial because circumstances don't control not only his joy, but now his contentment.
[time=1721] How do we get there?
[time=1724] Well, what'd we learn last week?
[time=1728] We learned that I'm joyful, not because of how things are going.
[time=1732] How are things going in your life?
[time=1733] Joy has nothing to do with how things are going.
[time=1739] No, no, no, way before how things are going, far removed from how things are going, I'm simply joyful, we learned, because I'm in relationship with a loving God who thoughtfully and with purpose is ordering the events of my life, and whatever he allows, I do know this, there is nothing that can come in between me and God's best for me, so I rejoice.
[time=1763] We learned that last week, and we're learning the same principle again this week.
[time=1769] As it relates to his provision, as it relates to circumstance and provision, I live in relationship with not a mean, unfair, unjust God who is slow and has things slipped by him.
[time=1781] No, he is an omniscient, provident God who sees everything and nothing, nothing comes my way.
[time=1788] That I cannot survive, get through, while honoring him in a state of contentment.
[time=1795] I am at peace with both circumstances and provision because God is what, say it good.
[time=1803] It is learned, it is like joy
[time=1809] in that it is not circumstantial, and number three, it is found, it is found in Christ.
[time=1816] I don't know about you, but when I'm reading things like Philippians 4.12, and I see in 4.12 the statement, I have learned the secret, that fires me up.
[time=1829] Whenever I read that, I'm like, okay, cool, I'm gonna get my pen out, I'm gonna figure out what this thing is.
[time=1834] 'Cause when Paul says he has learned the secret of being content in really, really tough times and in really, really good times, I wanna know what the secret is, and he gives us the secret right here in the very next verse.
[time=1848] Here it is, I can do all things.
[time=1852] Everybody read those next two words, go.
[time=1854] Through him, through Christ Jesus, through him, through Christ Jesus, who strengthens me.
[time=1866] Boy, underline that, who strengthens me.
[time=1869] Through him, what a phrase.
[time=1870] Let me just teach you a little bit here about this phrase, through him who strengthens me.
[time=1876] In the Greek, in the original language here, it means literally where it says through him who strengthens me.
[time=1884] In the original, it would say literally to put power through the one who puts power into me.
[time=1892] That's how you would read it.
[time=1894] It's having power put into you.
[time=1898] I can do all things.
[time=1900] That points back to the passage.
[time=1902] We're talking about contentment.
[time=1904] We're talking about having a lot, having nothing.
[time=1906] And you can live in the balance and contentment.
[time=1909] You can do all things.
[time=1910] You can pull that off through the one who puts power into you.
[time=1916] It's a great phrase.
[time=1918] And if you wanna just know what that would look like, if you know what it does look, if you wanna know what it looks like, it looks like this.
[time=1925] If we were in the athletic arena, the best illustration here would be performance enhancing drugs.
[time=1934] The best illustration here would be steroids.
[time=1938] Because this phrase, how he puts power into you, it's talking about the union between you and Christ and how he literally puts into your person at the deepest part of who you are.
[time=1951] He puts into you this power that makes you something that you by yourself aren't.
[time=1956] And steroids, you get shot with steroids.
[time=1959] You take pills that are steroids for these performance enhancing drugs.
[time=1963] And you've heard the stories and you've seen the pictures and you know how that goes.
[time=1966] You get normal, nothing, everyday average guys or gals who aren't doing anything.
[time=1973] And they get injected with these steroids.
[time=1976] And all of a sudden, they're stronger than they used to be.
[time=1979] All of a sudden, they can do more than they used to do.
[time=1982] All of a sudden, they're performance level and where they can go and what they can do and how far they can hit the ball, how much they can lift everything off the charts because of what's been injected into them.
[time=1993] And this is exactly the picture that God gives us here in Philippians 4.13.
[time=2000] You are injected with a superhuman strength and extreme capacity to face any excess more than you should have ever been given.
[time=2013] Or any lack of the absence of what we sometimes thought we'd need and where they strong, contentment, you can say to the waitress, what?
[time=2028] I'm good.
[time=2031] I'm okay.
[time=2033] I really, truly am.
[time=2036] And I want to say this to you.
[time=2039] You really, truly can be good.
[time=2044] Positive mental attitude?
[time=2047] No, no, no, no.
[time=2048] She, and I want to make a point here.
[time=2050] We're talking about those.
[time=2052] We're talking about a contentment that is available to those who have fully surrendered their hearts and lives to Christ.
[time=2060] You see my friends, we're talking today about something that you only get in who, in Christ.
[time=2068] Somebody asked me after first hour, so you're telling me, I don't know the Lord.
[time=2072] You're telling me I can't be content?
[time=2074] Yep.
[time=2078] It's a short conversation.
[time=2082] (congregation laughing) I said yes.
[time=2085] If, if, what we're talking about is true contentment.
[time=2090] 'Cause if you want a positive mental attitude, just keep buying the tapes.
[time=2096] Just keep going to the seminars.
[time=2099] Just keep going to the workshops and just keep dumping hundreds and thousands of dollars and why do people keep dropping hundreds of thousands of dollars on positive mental attitude, seminars and workshops?
[time=2112] Because it doesn't work.
[time=2114] Oh, it works, but then it fades and then you need more.
[time=2120] So you write the check, does this make sense?
[time=2124] I'm talking about no more checks, 'cause it already got what paid.
[time=2130] I'm talking about a contentment that is real and that is lasting, that doesn't fade and doesn't go away.
[time=2138] It is found in Christ.
[time=2143] And we want you to have that.
[time=2147] Anybody here this morning, I want so desperately for you to have that and to experience that.
[time=2153] For the rest of your days.
[time=2156] I hope you will.
[time=2158] It's learned.
[time=2161] Over time, it is like joy.
[time=2163] Has nothing to do with circumstances.
[time=2165] It is found in Christ.
[time=2167] And lastly, it births, I love this.
[time=2171] It births contentment has a way of birthing generosity.
[time=2176] It really does and I want you to think about this with me.
[time=2179] First of all, I want you to read with me.
[time=2181] I told you we'd come back to this.
[time=2183] They gave Paul a gift.
[time=2184] These Philippians were, they were a content people.
[time=2188] You yourselves also know Philippians, verse 15, that at the first preaching of the gospel, after I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, but you alone.
[time=2202] You've always been gracious.
[time=2204] You've always been content for even infessional in Ika.
[time=2207] When he wasn't with them, when he wasn't there, when he was away at another place, at another church doing other things, even while at Thessalonica, you sent a gift.
[time=2216] More than once for my needs.
[time=2218] Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which increases for the profit which increases to your account.
[time=2227] But I have received everything in full and have an abundance.
[time=2232] I am amply supplied.
[time=2234] I have noticed my friends.
[time=2239] Those of you here today, those of you watching on the broadcast, I have noticed this.
[time=2245] I'm gonna just share a few things about what I've seen over the years as it relates to contentment and generosity.
[time=2252] I have noticed content people want or need, however you wanna say that, less and less and less as the years go by.
[time=2265] I've watched that.
[time=2267] It's amazing.
[time=2268] They want less and less and less as the years go by.
[time=2274] I would say this to you.
[time=2275] You know, you know you are growing in contentment.
[time=2279] You know that you are content when you start spending more time thinking about what, how to whom you can give, then what, how, or to whom you can get.
[time=2294] There's a lot of people, myself included over the years, spend a lot of time thinking about how we can get.
[time=2302] And when you stop thinking about getting and you start thinking more and more and more about giving, it's a surefire sign, God's doing a work of contentment in your spirit and in your life, amen?
[time=2317] Yeah, here's another one for you.
[time=2320] Content people, I love this, content people, have a way of, and they do it all the time, they recalibrate their wish list.
[time=2328] And believe me, you know it's true.
[time=2333] I know it's true, we've all got 'em.
[time=2335] Some of us even write 'em out.
[time=2338] But if we don't write it out, you know in your heart and soul that you've got this list that you live with, right?
[time=2345] Of what you wish you had, what you wanna get.
[time=2350] What would be really cool to have.
[time=2353] What you wish you owned, what you wanna get, what would be really cool to have.
[time=2358] You and I both, we've got this list in our minds that if we could just attain this or if we could just achieve this.
[time=2364] And there's this list and the list just is more and more and more about this.
[time=2368] And as contentment grows in you, that list gets recalibrated, it gets changed.
[time=2373] And all of a sudden the list is doing this.
[time=2376] All of a sudden the list starts to look like, "Wow, maybe I could do this for them." Maybe they need that.
[time=2381] Maybe all of a sudden the list becomes very others centered.
[time=2385] Whereas the list used to be extremely you centered.
[time=2391] Contentment is growing as that list gets recalibrated.
[time=2397] Here's one last one for you.
[time=2398] Contentment grows hearts.
[time=2402] It does, contentment has a way of making hearts big.
[time=2408] And maybe you know what I mean by that because maybe you know what it's like to be greedy.
[time=2412] Because greed shrinks 'em.
[time=2415] Greed shrinks hearts.
[time=2418] It's why greedy people can say the meanest things.
[time=2422] It's why greedy people can be so unspeakably unthoughtful at times.
[time=2428] It's why greedy people are so insensitive.
[time=2431] Greed shrinks hearts into little, shrunken, hard, calcified, nothing.
[time=2440] Contentment breathes life into a heart.
[time=2446] The heart grows.
[time=2448] The heart gets big.
[time=2449] You start thinking things you've never thought.
[time=2451] And there is a grace and a kindness and an other centeredness in you that just blossoms.
[time=2458] It's learned.
[time=2462] It's like joy.
[time=2464] It's found in Christ.
[time=2465] It births generosity.
[time=2467] Oh church, I hope this morning that you will take these truths and allow God to teach you.
[time=2473] Allow God to convict you.
[time=2476] Allow God to move in you in ways that would move you more and more toward the middle of that picture.
[time=2482] And a life where you could truly say, I'm good.
[time=2485] I'm gonna invite Adam and the team to come back.
[time=2488] I'll invite you to please not go anywhere.
[time=2491] We got time left this morning.
[time=2492] I pray that you'll stay and be a part of this closing time of worship.
[time=2496] Here's what I wanna do.
[time=2497] I wanna ask any elders in the room.
[time=2503] I wanna ask any of our staff people in the room to just make your way down to the front here.
[time=2509] In a moment, I'm gonna have all of you stand and we are just gonna worship God from our hearts and thank him this morning for all that he has shown us and all that he's doing in us.
[time=2518] If there is anybody in the room that would just simply like to be prayed for as it relates to this issue that we've touched on today, you need help to be content.
[time=2529] God has made you content and you wanna thank him for that.
[time=2533] You're facing something and you just don't know how it's gonna go and you wanna be content, but you're worried, whatever the situation might be, anybody in the room, as we sing and as we worship, couple two three songs, just make your way down, we'll pray with you.
[time=2545] If you wanna just come down and be on your own and just kneel at the front down here, you can do that.
[time=2550] But let's have this be a closing few minutes where we worship God, where we come to God in prayer and where we do that together as a family.
[time=2556] Would you stand and let's pray and let's worship.
[time=2560] (gentle music)
[time=2584] [MUSIC - 519 seconds]
[time=3108] - Hey, we're gonna sing one more song.
[time=3116] I just hope and ask that you as a family would just lift the roof off this place with worship and praise and thanksgiving.
[time=3125] Anybody in the room, you wanna meet the Lord for the first time, come let us pray with you.
[time=3131] You're never gonna have joy.
[time=3132] You'll never be content without Him.
[time=3134] So come on down and let us pray with you and talk with you.
[time=3136] Anybody in the room facing anything at all.
[time=3140] It's got you all sideways and concerned and anxious and worried and you want to have joy and contentment.
[time=3145] Let us pray with you.
[time=3146] Make your way on down and we'll do that with you.
[time=3148] Let's sing one more and let's worship our God together.
[time=3152] [MUSIC - 46 seconds]
