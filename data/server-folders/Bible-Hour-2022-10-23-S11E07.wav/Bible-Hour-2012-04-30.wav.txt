[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Well, hey, how are you folks?
[time=33] Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=35] It is good to be with you.
[time=36] And I am really, really excited about what's coming your way today and not just today, but the next couple, two or three weeks, we are jumping into a teaching series that we've entitled sent.
[time=48] And you can see the graphic on the screen.
[time=50] It's a great picture and a great word.
[time=54] And it is a great principle that God's people, those who live in relationship with Him, have to understand.
[time=61] And I would say that so many of us over the years have forgotten it, so many of us over the years, maybe have just become confused about it.
[time=70] And I think it's time for us to get really, really clear that as believers, the last thing in the world that God ever designed for us to do was to sit still.
[time=80] The last thing God ever wanted from us, His people, His prized possession, this priesthood that the scriptures talk about, the last thing He ever wanted was for us to huddle up and call it a day right here in our comfortable, holy huddle, if you will.
[time=97] No, God's word is clear, His people from the beginning.
[time=100] And you'll hear about this today.
[time=101] From the beginning, God's people were always designed by God to go.
[time=106] That was the plan that we would be a people who would go because God from the beginning sent us to the nations, to those who don't know Him, to those who desperately need His redemptive, merciful, gracious love.
[time=122] And so we want to talk about it.
[time=123] We want to teach about it.
[time=124] Over these next three weeks, we're going to give you the chance to consider the fact that you've been sent, but are you responding in a way that honors God?
[time=133] Are you going?
[time=134] Are you willing to take the great message of hope, the great truth of the gospel, and where you live, where you work, where you travel, here in the States, across the world, whatever God may have in store for you, are you one who has been sent?
[time=149] Are you living as one who has been sent?
[time=152] I can't wait to talk to you about it.
[time=154] I can't wait for your hearts and mind to be encouraged on this front.
[time=158] Three weeks sent, can't wait to see what God's going to do.
[time=161] I hope you'll tune in.
[time=163] As always, I hope more than tuning in.
[time=165] I hope you'll come Sunday mornings nine and 1045.
[time=168] We'd love to have you here.
[time=170] Hey, God bless you.
[time=171] Have a great week.
[time=172] I'm glad you tuned in.
[time=173] (upbeat music) (singing in foreign language)
[time=207] (singing in foreign language)
[time=237] [MUSIC - 106 seconds]
[time=347] Hey, I wanted to say before we go any further, so very thankful for what you just saw, so grateful for what you just heard, for the worship that we got to experience.
[time=356] I know some of you know this, others of you may not, but the truth of the matter is that the demographic of individuals today in this world that are leaving the church in mass all over the world, this one demographic of people are leaving the church in mass, and they're leaving because they don't feel like they belong, they don't feel like they can connect, they don't feel like they're gifts, and their talents can somehow fit into what's always been done.
[time=391] That demographic, my friends, are late high school, post high school, 16, 17, 18, mid 20s.
[time=400] They're leaving.
[time=402] And I'm so grateful that we are a family who can take a Sunday morning like this and other Sunday mornings and other settings here in this church and celebrate the giftedness and the passion and the abilities that God has given young people, and it might be different and it might be louder, and it might be this or it might be that, but I am so thrilled that they're doing this and not something else, amen?
[time=428] So thankful.
[time=429] (applause) And it is the mark, it is the mark of a mature church, it's the mark of mature people who look at something or observe something that might not be up your alley and say, "Praise God, they're here." And thank God that we get to experience what's in their hearts, and I'm so proud of this place, and so thankful.
[time=450] I looked at Matt Morese, he was up here playing guitar, Hannah here singing, 16 years old, both of them.
[time=457] And I thought about me when I was 16, and I shuddered, and I just got so grateful for Adam Jones, who leads them and other young people here, and now they've developed this passion for worship and the passion for the church, and it's all good.
[time=473] Jesse, Hannah, come on up.
[time=475] I want to just make sure that all of you know who Jesse is, some of you who've been around for a while, you have no problem recognizing Jesse.
[time=484] Others, if you might be new, if you're new, Jesse oversees all of our student ministries, he has for a number of years, but he is way, way beyond just a youth guy.
[time=494] Jesse's been gifted by God as a communicator and as a teacher, he helps lead our staff on a number of different fronts.
[time=501] God's given him a great mind, and he's been a huge encouragement to me, and I can't wait for you to hear what God's put on his heart.
[time=508] We're kicking off a new series this morning.
[time=510] Jesse's going to start us out, I'll be back the next couple of weeks, and I'm really looking forward to it, so Jesse, Hannah, here we go.
[time=517] All right, all right, all right, here we go.
[time=519] Yeah, yeah.
[time=520] All right, come on, that's a little better than that.
[time=523] How's it going?
[time=524] Ah, just kidding.
[time=526] If you're new here, this is your first time.
[time=528] You've never been in Black Hawk.
[time=529] I am his boss.
[time=531] So we would like to welcome you.
[time=533] He's doing a great job as pastor here, and I evaluate him weekly, and he's doing such a good job leading in the areas.
[time=541] I allow him to lead in, and he's doing a good job.
[time=544] If you've been here for a while, you know that that's so true.
[time=549] Just kidding.
[time=551] Whitty banter, so good.
[time=553] Okay, good morning, it's April, it's cooler outside.
[time=556] The sun's shining, it's back, we're kind of here.
[time=558] It's good to be at church today, and I just want to reiterate what he talked about, just the awesomeness of teenagers using their gifts in our body, just how our family, when we surround them and put our arms around teenagers, the statistics shoot through the roof of them, their faith lasting past high school into their adult lives, and that is the goal of all that we do in student marriage.
[time=583] We want to see them embrace and pursue Christ for a lifetime, not just four years in high school for a lifetime, and that is so cool.
[time=591] And I didn't mention last service, the drama, you know, more teenagers, it was just such a good picture of God, makes beautiful things, and that is so true.
[time=601] I know it's true in my life.
[time=603] When I was 16, I was not even close to Christ.
[time=606] I didn't even know there was this guy named Jesus.
[time=609] I didn't have a Bible, I had never been in church, I didn't come to Christ till 17, okay?
[time=614] So I was like KB out doing crazy stuff, and having a good time, and then Jesus radically changed my life forever.
[time=623] And the unsung hero of the morning, I think, is the guy who has the ear who can make all of that work together, and he turns these knobs in such a way with his ears, his name's Ross, he's my buddy, and he just did such a good, I'm just so thankful to see him.
[time=643] I don't know if you've ever noticed, but when he's running the soundboard, nobody can really see it, but he is worshiping God.
[time=652] He is using his gift, and he is worshiping me.
[time=655] I just wanted to shout out to Ross Boss, he's my buddy, he's my pal, in fact, when I first came here, he hated me.
[time=661] He didn't like me, but now we're good buddies, everybody.
[time=666] So, yeah, your shout out's coming, don't worry.
[time=672] Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, beautiful things, we are new, I hope you know that this morning, and so we are starting a new series like KB said, we have finished Philippians, and I hope the truths that KB expounded for us and taught us from Philippians is still challenging you in your relationship with Christ, and I'm hoping that that is really affecting you in your walk.
[time=693] So, what's next?
[time=694] As he said, we're kicking off a new series called SENT, and a few weeks ago, KB just was talking in our staff time, and something was stirring in his heart, he said, "I just want to make sure that we keep throwing seed, the idea of Luke 8, parable of the sewers, that we don't forget that that is what we are called to do as a people." See, we've been in this season last few months at Black Hawk, and we've been doing these things called Grow Group, but we've been encouraging people to be in a Grow Group because we want people to grow.
[time=725] We want to focus on this discipleship-based, this spiritual formation piece, and there are classes across the street killing sin and racing hell.
[time=734] When sinners say, "I do marriage stuff," studying the word for altar was really good, solid classes, taught by gifted people who really love God, but Kelly felt like we have to keep throwing seed, and we can't forget that each one of us is called,
[time=754] that each one of us is SENT to proclaim the gospel in the lives of people.
[time=760] We work with, we go to school with, in our neighborhoods, each and every single one of us in this room.
[time=767] If you have come to Christ in a saving knowledge in a saving way, we are called, "We are SENT to the world to proclaim Him." There are two lakes, one is the Sea of Galilee, one is the Dead Sea, and these lakes have the same river source feeding into them, the Jordan River.
[time=785] They are only 65 miles apart in distance, but they are vastly different.
[time=791] One is thriving and lush, and life is happening in this lake.
[time=795] The other is completely dead.
[time=797] It's just completely dead.
[time=799] Nothing can really live in there because it's like 10 times the salinity of the oceans.
[time=804] Why is this so different?
[time=806] See, the Sea of Galilee takes in water from the north, and it flows out to the south. There is an outlet.
[time=813] These two, the difference is there is an outlet for one and not for the other.
[time=818] The Dead Sea has no place for the water to go.
[time=820] It doesn't flow out. It's one of the deepest spots on the planet, and it has no outlet.
[time=827] So it just keeps taking in and taking in and taking in, and has no outlet.
[time=832] And as Christ follows, all we do is sit and soak.
[time=837] If we just come to church, we sit and we just listen.
[time=841] We become constipated believers.
[time=847] Yeah, I knew you'd like that.
[time=850] See, if we don't have an outlet for the hope that is in us, if we aren't regularly sharing, regularly involving our lives in the other people's growth and sharing the word of God, the gospel, then we are just dead.
[time=864] We cannot grow because growth, in my mind, equals more steps of obedience.
[time=870] And this is a command, not something we just, maybe you should do it.
[time=874] This is a command, growth happens when we share, when we get outside of ourselves, we have an outlet.
[time=880] See, God is on mission to renew all things.
[time=884] He's working, he wants to work, and he's going to work through his people to bring transformation into this fallen world.
[time=893] For God to restore the brokenness through us, we will have to realize and remember that we are sent.
[time=901] Send into the world to do that, to call people and to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ.
[time=907] So for the next few weeks, we're going to remind ourselves.
[time=910] We're going to encourage each other.
[time=911] We're going to kick each other in the booty and make sure that we know and we remember that we never forget that we are sent to tell the world about Christ.
[time=922] So, where did this sentence begin?
[time=926] If you have notes and you want to turn it this way and you can draw this image on the screen, it's kind of hard to see, but it's basically like greater than less than signs.
[time=936] They're kind of coming together like this at points.
[time=938] I'm going to walk through something.
[time=940] We're going to start really tall.
[time=941] We're headed to Matthew chapter 28.
[time=943] So if you want to turn there, you can.
[time=945] But in the meantime, we're going to head from God, and we're going to come to this other side, and in the middle is going to be Jesus.
[time=950] So that's kind of where we're headed.
[time=951] We're going to start with God in the beginning.
[time=953] We're going to head towards Jesus and then see what Matthew has to say.
[time=956] Start begging, we'll get really small, okay?
[time=960] So, first thing is God.
[time=962] And I should come up on the notes.
[time=964] God in the beginning, God created.
[time=966] God made all things.
[time=967] This is the all-powerful, all-knowing, all-loving God who through his spoken word created all things.
[time=976] In the beginning, God.
[time=978] Secondly, God sends Adam and Eve.
[time=980] He creates them out of the dust of the ground and he creates them and he sends them to the garden to care for it, to nurture it, to work it.
[time=989] He sends Adam and Eve to care for all of creation.
[time=992] Then in chapter 3, in Genesis chapter 3, everything goes wrong.
[time=998] Sin enters, destroys and wrecks and perverts all the harmony and all the peace that is on the planet.
[time=1005] D.A. Carson wrote a book called The God Who Is There.
[time=1009] Excellent, excellent book.
[time=1011] And the chapter that he devoted to Adam and Eve, he titled it The God Who Does Not Wipe Out Rebels.
[time=1019] So, when Adam and Eve sinned, he had every right to just destroy them, just to kill them.
[time=1026] But he doesn't.
[time=1027] We get this little picture into the heart of God, the mission of God, is not so much to destroy,
[time=1033] but he's going to do something.
[time=1035] He doesn't. He slays an animal. He puts it covering on them with this little window into God's heart that he's not quite done.
[time=1043] He's going to do something. He's heading somewhere, right?
[time=1047] They mess up. He takes care of it. And then after that, you know, there's the sin gets kind of worse.
[time=1053] It kind of keeps going. There's murder and it just gets bad and so God says, "All right, that's it." And he sends the flood, but he holds back just another time.
[time=1061] He doesn't completely wipe off the people from the planet.
[time=1066] He spares Noah and his family.
[time=1068] And it's almost time he's like, "Ah, it's going to happen, but it doesn't. He spares Noah." And so you can kind of see that God is doing something.
[time=1076] And then after the floods recede and it just kind of keeps sin, keeps going, and the man decides, "Well, we're going to build a tower and make a name for ourselves.
[time=1084] We're going to raise ourselves up." Because there's no, no, I don't share any glory with anybody.
[time=1091] I am the God. And so he confuses the languages and that happens.
[time=1096] And then on the pages of our Bibles, it got explodes in an unprecedented act.
[time=1101] Abraham, Genesis chapter 12, Abraham, he sees he's going to send Abraham out of his country
[time=1108] and all that he knows. And in Genesis chapter 12, he says this, "The Lord had said to Abraham, 'Go from your country, your people and your father's household to the land I will show you. I'll make you into a great nation. I will bless you.
[time=1120] I will make your name great and you will be a blessing.
[time=1124] I will bless those who curse you and whoever curses you, I will curse.
[time=1128] And all peoples on earth will be blessed through you." Eventually that promise in 12 becomes this covenant in 15 and 17.
[time=1135] And he says, "These four things God will give Abraham many descendants.
[time=1139] They will possess the land. God will be their God." And number four, this is a big one, I think, as we think about sentness.
[time=1147] Through them all the nations of the world will be blessed.
[time=1151] That's the big one. This is, we kind of get a sense of God's heart that on the first time in Scripture that we see God using a people to bring blessing to others.
[time=1162] God is now going to use people to bring blessing to the world.
[time=1167] So we have this sentness field. God's heart is exposed a little bit.
[time=1171] He doesn't want to bring destruction. He wants to bring life.
[time=1175] He wants to restore all things to the way they were in the garden.
[time=1179] And so we have this unprecedented act that God is going to use people to bless the world.
[time=1184] And then God sends Moses to the Israelites and the Exodus.
[time=1188] And he sends the laws so they can interact with each other.
[time=1191] And then we have this in the Gospel of Matthew, Matthew chapter 3.
[time=1194] John the Baptist comes and he says, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is near." This is he who has spoken of through the prophet Isaiah, a voice of one calling in the desert, "Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight
[time=1209] paths for him." God sends Jesus.
[time=1214] God comes to planet earth.
[time=1218] See Colossians 1 that says this about Jesus, "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation, for by him all things were created, things in heaven and on earth visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities, all things were created by him and for him."
[time=1239] He is before all things and him all things hold together and he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead so that in everything he might have the supremacy.
[time=1251] For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven by making peace through his blood shed on a cross.
[time=1264] So all of the beginning in the beginning God and now we're funneling down, everything is flowing towards Christ.
[time=1272] And we have this climax, but it's not the end.
[time=1276] It's going to come to this and it's going to flow out of.
[time=1279] It's a powerful image of what God is doing.
[time=1281] See, Jesus stood on the planet and he was baptized and he was tempted.
[time=1285] He began to preach, repent for the kingdom of heaven is near.
[time=1289] He sees some guy fishing and says, "Hey, come follow me and I'll make you fishers of men." He heals the sick and teaches on the mount of a salt and light and law fulfillment and prayer and fasting in heaven and judging others.
[time=1303] He then he feeds 5,000 rebukes of religious leaders of the day, puts them to shame, heals some more people, teaches some more parables, teaches with authority.
[time=1313] Jesus is on the planet.
[time=1315] He is eventually betrayed and arrested and crucified and dies on the cross and then three days later resurrected, defeating death, conquering evil and ascending to heaven.
[time=1327] Hebrews 1 tells us in the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets and many times in various ways.
[time=1333] These last days he spoke to us by his son, whom he impounded air of all things and through whom also he made the universe.
[time=1341] The son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his power forward.
[time=1349] After he had provided for verification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the majesty of God.
[time=1356] But before he goes to sit next to God, before he leaves the planet, before the God who comes down to provide purification and sin forgiveness, before he leaves the planet, right?
[time=1373] He's going to gather his disciples together.
[time=1377] He's going to bring them close and he's going to say some words to them before he takes off, right?
[time=1383] He's probably sitting down, he probably looks them in the eye and it says that he was on the mountain in Galilee.
[time=1390] It's probably a high hill, okay?
[time=1392] Probably a high hill.
[time=1393] And we know from the rest of Scripture that God uses these mountains or these high hills to reveal some important things about himself.
[time=1404] Mount Sinai to the Sermon on the Mount to the Transfiguration.
[time=1407] God uses these to reveal something of utmost importance.
[time=1410] And our text is no different.
[time=1412] Jesus bring all disciples together one last time for something really, really important.
[time=1419] Almost kind of like parting words or the words that are spoken before we go to battle.
[time=1426] And I think Hollywood gets these moments right.
[time=1430] Hollywood does a really good job with how they kind of set it up and the music they use, right?
[time=1436] If you think of rocky too.
[time=1439] It's like 15.
[time=1441] But if you think of rocky too, right?
[time=1443] The first one he gets a shot at the title.
[time=1445] He goes all rounds with the champs.
[time=1448] And the second one he's going to get another shot at the title because the champion's tick.
[time=1453] He's like that was a freak thing.
[time=1455] And I'm going to show the world that I can dominate this guy.
[time=1458] But this time around rocky can't really get into his training.
[time=1463] He's just kind of not really into it.
[time=1465] See this time he's got a wife and his wife is pregnant.
[time=1468] And she's really concerned that he's going to get hurt.
[time=1472] And so she's been kind of talking to him about don't get hurt.
[time=1474] Don't get hurt.
[time=1475] So he's kind of like I'm not sure if I can really.
[time=1477] His head's just not in the game.
[time=1480] And so then his wife Adrian gets sick and she's in the hospital and she falls into a coma and the baby's delivered early.
[time=1487] And it's like oh no, is Adrian going to die?
[time=1489] And you're just like in a movie so good, right?
[time=1491] And so he's sitting there at her side.
[time=1493] He's waiting.
[time=1495] Finally she wakes up and the baby's fine.
[time=1496] Everybody's happy.
[time=1497] And they're just kind of sitting there talking.
[time=1499] She pulls him close in the hospital bed.
[time=1501] So baby, she's holding the baby.
[time=1502] He's right here.
[time=1503] He's looking at the baby.
[time=1504] Well, she'll be cold.
[time=1505] He's doing that.
[time=1509] So she pulls him.
[time=1511] She goes I just have one thing I need you to do for me.
[time=1514] Right?
[time=1515] Now she just come off coma and he's all excited about the baby.
[time=1518] She pulls him close and she says one thing or she's like what?
[time=1522] What is it?
[time=1523] And she says win.
[time=1528] And then the music goes ding, ding, ding.
[time=1531] And then the next thing is he's running.
[time=1533] You know, he's going.
[time=1534] He's pumping.
[time=1535] He's doing it.
[time=1536] He's just going crazy.
[time=1537] Like all right, my wife, my woman has told me to win.
[time=1540] And I'm going to go and I'm going to train and train and train.
[time=1543] His head's in and he's going crazy.
[time=1546] Right?
[time=1547] He gets into the ring and he beats the champ.
[time=1549] Whoo, nice.
[time=1550] Right?
[time=1551] There was just that click moment when she says win.
[time=1554] She sent him out to accomplish that mission to win that fight.
[time=1559] There's another great movie, Braveheart.
[time=1562] Right?
[time=1563] Departing words to a battle.
[time=1565] It didn't work out so well for them.
[time=1567] But these words that he said were just super good.
[time=1571] Eventually it would.
[time=1572] Right?
[time=1573] That was the battle that he had to lose before he had the victory.
[time=1575] But he's just like, you know, you know what he says.
[time=1578] I'm not going to try to quote him.
[time=1580] It was awesome.
[time=1581] No.
[time=1582] And then another one I found was remember the Titans.
[time=1587] Such a good movie.
[time=1590] And it's the part when the rest were trying to cheat and they're calling the calls wrong.
[time=1598] And the coach goes on and says, you call this game fair?
[time=1601] And he's like, whatever.
[time=1602] So he coached everybody on me.
[time=1604] Right?
[time=1605] And he says, you guys want to hit.
[time=1606] We're going to blitz all night.
[time=1608] Right?
[time=1609] He just gets in their face.
[time=1610] And I want you to remember forever the night that they played the Titans.
[time=1614] And all these guys are like, yeah.
[time=1616] And they go on there's smacking people and kicking them.
[time=1619] And it was amazing.
[time=1621] It was just that switch moment when somebody says something.
[time=1625] And it changes the trajectory of where you're headed.
[time=1629] Right?
[time=1630] And this is Jesus.
[time=1631] He's pulling people together.
[time=1632] He's pulling his disciples together for that click moment when he's going to say some things.
[time=1637] Here's what he says, all authority and heaven on earth has been given to me.
[time=1642] Therefore go and make disciples of all nations.
[time=1646] Baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1649] And teaching them to obey everything I've commanded you.
[time=1652] And surely I am with you at the very end of the age.
[time=1656] See, like I said earlier, everything flows towards Christ in the image.
[time=1661] And now at this moment, now it flows from Christ.
[time=1665] It's now sending his disciples to the world.
[time=1668] And he gives them this mission.
[time=1669] He gives them this task.
[time=1671] And it's to change the world basically.
[time=1673] Tell them about me.
[time=1676] That's what he says.
[time=1677] Now we're going to zero in verse 18.
[time=1679] We're going to go verse by verse on this Matthew 28.
[time=1682] Verse 18 says this, all authority has been given to me.
[time=1688] All authority is mine.
[time=1689] The word authority is highlighted all throughout Matthew that Jesus taught with this authority.
[time=1694] The Greek is uksia, pasa uksia, all authority that's like this divine power.
[time=1699] The supernatural power, having the right or the ability or the capacity to.
[time=1705] The official right to change your life with what I'm about to say.
[time=1711] Right?
[time=1712] The right, the capacity to alter your destiny.
[time=1718] And these words that he speaks to these disciples alters their destiny and ours.
[time=1726] What I'm about to tell you will change your life from now on.
[time=1731] There's not too many things in our lives that when somebody says it to you or you hear it,
[time=1738] does it change your life?
[time=1740] But there are some.
[time=1741] For example, when my wife came to me and said, I'm pregnant.
[time=1745] Whoa, are we trying to do that?
[time=1749] I don't remember.
[time=1750] I have cancer.
[time=1752] That changes your life.
[time=1754] I won the lottery.
[time=1756] I didn't really, but the Cubs just won the World Series.
[time=1765] This is not the message, but here's one of my greatest fears is that it's game seven,
[time=1771] two outs, Cubs are winning, World Series, bottom of the night, whatever.
[time=1775] And Jesus comes back.
[time=1780] True confession.
[time=1781] Just throwing it out there.
[time=1782] I'm like, just wait.
[time=1785] Anyway.
[time=1789] There's not too many things that can change your life.
[time=1792] Like, I'm, you're fired.
[time=1794] Katie tells me they're like, once a week.
[time=1796] You're fired.
[time=1797] Oh, come on.
[time=1798] It wasn't that big of a hole in the wall.
[time=1802] Okay.
[time=1803] Oh, Amy came when we went to the doctor, and the doctor said, I think it might be twins.
[time=1809] What?
[time=1810] I don't, I don't have a big enough house for that.
[time=1814] When Amy said, yes, when I said, will you marry me?
[time=1817] It changed my life.
[time=1818] She said, no, that changed my life.
[time=1820] That had been horrible.
[time=1822] Some of you are probably wondering, why did she say yes?
[time=1825] I don't know.
[time=1827] Still trying to figure that one out.
[time=1829] So there's just, there's not too many things that people can say to us that just alter our destinies, but there are a few.
[time=1835] He says of authority, he's going to change.
[time=1837] Verse 19, he says, therefore, right?
[time=1840] All authority is for me, mind, God has given it to me.
[time=1843] I'm going to change your life, what I'm about to say.
[time=1845] Therefore, the imperative, which means an unavoidable command.
[time=1849] Jesus is going to command them.
[time=1851] He says this, make disciples.
[time=1854] Call people to follow Jesus with all their life.
[time=1859] And he kind of gives a, how?
[time=1861] How should they do this?
[time=1862] Well, the first thing he says, go.
[time=1865] He says, go, which implies scent.
[time=1868] Right?
[time=1869] He says, go.
[time=1870] As you are walking in your life, as you are going about your life, you are sent.
[time=1876] You should be going.
[time=1877] You should be thinking all the time, how can I help people know Jesus better?
[time=1880] This is what now is the mission.
[time=1883] This is the sentness.
[time=1884] This is what we should do.
[time=1885] Go.
[time=1886] As you go about your life, as you work, at workplace, at home, in your neighborhoods, in your families, at school, wherever you're at, you are sent.
[time=1894] You go.
[time=1896] Regardless of if you're a pastor, a teacher, a lawyer, a doctor, doesn't matter.
[time=1901] This is universal.
[time=1903] Go.
[time=1904] Make disciples.
[time=1905] The second thing he tells him is, baptize them.
[time=1909] Emerse them in community.
[time=1911] Emerse them in love.
[time=1913] Emerse them in the acceptance of the church.
[time=1917] That is one, I think, one thing that happens when we baptize.
[time=1920] We are saying, we are welcoming you into this family based on your belief in Christ.
[time=1928] Emerse them into this body.
[time=1935] It's not just, I go to church.
[time=1938] We are connected with this community of people who need to be present for each other.
[time=1944] You don't go to church for yourself.
[time=1947] You are here for the person next to you.
[time=1952] This is a community that God dreamed, that God sends to be the church to each other and
[time=1960] to the world.
[time=1962] We don't go to church.
[time=1963] If we like it or we don't like, we come because we're a family.
[time=1966] See, we don't go to church.
[time=1967] We join our family for dinner.
[time=1970] I like that.
[time=1971] To celebrate Christ.
[time=1973] A follower of Christ without a church is an orphan and that's sad.
[time=1978] The third thing he tells them is teach them.
[time=1982] He tells them to go.
[time=1983] You are sent.
[time=1984] He says, bring them into the community.
[time=1986] He says, teach them.
[time=1987] It's bigger than just who wants some Jesus.
[time=1989] Raise your hand.
[time=1990] Awesome ice cream in the back.
[time=1992] It's bigger than that.
[time=1993] It can't just be that.
[time=1995] We have to go further than that.
[time=1997] We have to bring them in.
[time=1998] We have to help them.
[time=1999] We have to sit with them.
[time=2000] We have to walk them through.
[time=2001] What does it mean to be a Christ father?
[time=2003] I remember when I came to Christ at 17 and I had no idea this Bible stuff.
[time=2008] I didn't know any verses.
[time=2009] All I heard was the gospel.
[time=2011] Something clicked.
[time=2012] Yeah.
[time=2013] I want yes.
[time=2014] Thank you.
[time=2015] Yes.
[time=2016] And then I started hanging out with the kids in the youth ministry and just kind of hanging out with them.
[time=2020] I kind of learned what it meant to be this Christ follower thing.
[time=2023] I asked my buddy, what should he say?
[time=2025] Well, read the gospel of John letters.
[time=2026] I read in John.
[time=2027] I'm like, sweet.
[time=2028] Now what else to do?
[time=2029] Oh, you should probably pray a little.
[time=2030] I'm like, okay, I'll pray a little.
[time=2031] It was just these little steps that helped me along the way.
[time=2034] There's been multiple people in my life who've helped me along the way.
[time=2037] I can think of Dr. Ashby who was at Ball State, the Ball State University, the Ivy League School in Muncie that you didn't know about.
[time=2045] Okay.
[time=2046] Dr. Ashby who was a former pastor and he was teaching these classes at Ball State called Paul
[time=2053] and Developing Church.
[time=2055] And he was teaching them from a Christian perspective and I'm like, this is awesome.
[time=2060] Does anybody know what's happening at Ball State?
[time=2064] He was like, the Harvard chair supports what we're doing.
[time=2066] Paul, we're doing New Testament, all the tests.
[time=2068] I'm like, this is really, really good stuff.
[time=2070] And it helped me learn.
[time=2071] And through his relationship, he married Amy.
[time=2074] He spurned me on to want to go to seminary and get my master's degree.
[time=2078] Because I just wanted to know the scriptures.
[time=2081] I almost transferred from Ball State because I was just so hungry.
[time=2083] I didn't understand anything.
[time=2084] I'm leaving Bible studies and telling people about Jesus, but I knew like two verses.
[time=2089] I should probably figure something out.
[time=2091] I should probably know something about something.
[time=2093] I should probably know that.
[time=2094] It would be good.
[time=2095] Right?
[time=2096] So it was just this.
[time=2097] He helped me teach me.
[time=2098] So we teach each other.
[time=2099] We help teach.
[time=2100] We have to take people.
[time=2101] There are these high school kids right here, shout out, accomplished.
[time=2104] Right?
[time=2105] They are going to these middle school kids because they know they're sent and they're helping them understand what it means to walk with Christ.
[time=2112] Say, is it all the knowledge they're teaching them?
[time=2115] Some of it, yes.
[time=2116] Some of it's just watching their life.
[time=2118] Unfold.
[time=2119] They're sharing their life together.
[time=2121] Our Taco Bell versus that not only do we come to you, we shared our lives with you.
[time=2126] 2 Thessalonians.
[time=2127] That's such a good thing where we share our lives together.
[time=2131] Small groups, smaller communities, boom.
[time=2133] That is powerful.
[time=2134] We get people in a room who are just sharing life together.
[time=2138] Change happens.
[time=2139] Okay.
[time=2140] Says teach them.
[time=2142] Then so he says, make disciples go.
[time=2144] Baptize teach, Black Caucus said, as a church, that a true father of Christ is passionate
[time=2151] about making more, that each and every single one of us should be taking steps to build a redemptive relationship, whether that be friendship or co-worker, somebody far from
[time=2162] God, and that each and every one of us should be helping others be spiritually equipped by just sharing our lives together, causing others to know God more.
[time=2173] And so my one question is just, are we doing this?
[time=2177] As a community of believers, are we doing that?
[time=2182] Do we regularly see ourselves as sent?
[time=2187] Or do we see it?
[time=2188] That's the church.
[time=2189] That's the pastor's job.
[time=2192] That's a big job.
[time=2195] We got to all do this together.
[time=2197] Go.
[time=2198] Are we going?
[time=2199] Are we sent?
[time=2200] Are we crossing the streets and our neighborhoods and at work?
[time=2202] When we make it baptized, are we immersing people and community here?
[time=2205] Are we teaching?
[time=2206] There's so many opportunities in this place and mentoring programs in our community here.
[time=2214] But we can just help others know Jesus better.
[time=2217] Moms and dads, are you modeling this faith?
[time=2221] Sometimes when they hit that teenage year, they're not going to hear this anymore, they're going to shut you out sometimes, but they're going to watch you, they're going to see how
[time=2230] you live your faith, they're going to watch how you love your spouse, that is teaching
[time=2236] them.
[time=2238] And then not only does Jesus say this, but he says this at the end, and surely I will be with you always to the very end of the age.
[time=2247] We don't have to do it on our own.
[time=2250] God has provided this church, this body, we have friends who know Jesus, who can come alongside, we can do this together, and more importantly, Jesus is with us.
[time=2262] We are a sent people.
[time=2267] I did this last time.
[time=2268] What if in Matthew it would have ended like this?
[time=2274] Jesus says this, "Hey guys, it's been a real joy working with all of you."
[time=2280] We really gave those Pharisees a run for their money.
[time=2283] We had some laughs, some good times and some memories, and I will love you guys forever.
[time=2288] Good luck with your fishing.
[time=2289] But what if he would have, the church would have gone nowhere, it would be no church.
[time=2294] So he sent them, and God sends the church, and he sends us, and that's powerful.
[time=2304] So, band, you can come up, I want to do that into this last time, I think it'll work, I think.
[time=2310] He's on mission to renew all things.
[time=2313] He longs and desires and commands us, his people, to bring transformation to a fallen world, to tell people about Christ.
[time=2322] Luke tells us to be witnesses to the thing, to him and all that he's done.
[time=2326] For Jesus to restore the brokenness through us, we will have to realize, remember, and obey that we are sent, called to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ.
[time=2338] So one of the things I think happens when we hear a message like this, is we've got it
[time=2347] in our heads that I'm not gifted at that.
[time=2350] That's not my spiritual gift, I don't really, listen, it's a universal command.
[time=2360] It's an imperative, it's an unavoidable command.
[time=2364] And we are saved, we sign up for Jesus, we sign up for all of it, and just some of it.
[time=2371] And he's asked us, he's calling, he's sending us to proclaim Christ.
[time=2376] What better message, what better job could you have than to proclaim Christ, who loves
[time=2382] and restores and died on the cross.
[time=2384] But see, when we just think it's just one person's job, here's when I touch your shoulder, I want you to stand up, right, if it's just my job, right, I'm going to tell you about
[time=2396] Jesus.
[time=2397] Look, he comes to Christ, that's awesome, and this young man, and this young man, right, when I touch you to stand up.
[time=2401] But I'm doing my best to tell people about Christ, you don't understand if you don't want to.
[time=2406] Right, I'm doing my best and I'm working on, I'm doing, baby, I can't touch that.
[time=2410] And this guy right here, look, I'm telling him about Jesus, he comes to Christ, he's standing, right.
[time=2413] And I'm working, I'm working in the room, trying to tell more of you about Christ, brother, come to Jesus.
[time=2418] We're working around, right, but I'm getting tired, you understand, yeah, you guys should stand beautiful people right there, that's my wife and kid, right.
[time=2426] So we can tell people about Jesus, you want to stand up, come on up, hey boy, you want to stand up, come on, you want some Jesus good, right, that's awesome.
[time=2436] People are coming to Christ, now you can sit down.
[time=2439] Now let's say we really understand that we are a cent people, right.
[time=2444] So I'm going to tell this young man, when I tell you to stand up, I want you to tell somebody else, and then they stand up, and watch the room explode.
[time=2452] Go ahead, touch somebody else, if I touch you, you touch somebody else, when you get touched, you stand up, when you get touched, you stand up, make sure you touch somebody else, right.
[time=2460] Go on, everybody, come on, we're cent, we got to do this, we got to tell people about Jesus, hey Mark, look at that, look at everybody coming to Christ, when we are cent, we can
[time=2470] change the world, one guy can't do it unless you're Jesus, he already did it, but he tells
[time=2476] us to do it now, right, we're changing the world, somebody's got to go to the balcony,
[time=2482] somebody's got to go, who's going to go, give me a high school kid, get up there Joe,
[time=2489] let's go, there we go, we are cent people, call to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ,
[time=2497] and we all understand that we are cent, we can change the world, look at everybody standing,
[time=2504] I couldn't do that, right, amen, amen.
[time=2534] I'm going to sing falling on my knees,
[time=2545] falling on my knees in a worship, giving all I am to seek your face, Lord all I am,
[time=2562] my whole life, my whole life, I believe sin, your is, got a mercy on me, bow down, in
[time=2583] your presence and your throne, I call, I call, you answer, and you came to my rescue and
[time=2605] I want to be where you are.
[time=2621] Falling on my knees in a worship, giving all I am to seek your face, Lord all I am,
[time=2635] my whole life, I believe sin, your is, got a mercy on me, bow down, in your presence
[time=2663] and your throne, I call, you answer, and you came to my rescue and I, I want to be where
[time=2709] you are.
[time=2739] Falling on my knees in a worship, giving all I am to seek your face, Lord all I am,
[time=2755] my whole life, I believe in all I am, I believe in all I am, I believe in all I am, I believe
