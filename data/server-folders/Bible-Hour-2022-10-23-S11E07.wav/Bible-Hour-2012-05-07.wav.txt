[time=31] - Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] It's great to be with you and I want you to know that every week I say it's great to be with you and I was reminded this week again that it really is great to be with you.
[time=45] It is a blessing to me.
[time=46] It's an encouragement to our team.
[time=48] I have had probably four or five conversations this week alone with people who watch the broadcast and so many of you just expressing your thankfulness and your gratitude for not just the message that comes each week but the spirit with which it comes and I know about that spirit.
[time=67] I am so grateful for this team.
[time=69] I'm so thankful for this place, this family and what God is doing here is a special thing and when you get to experience it each and every week I know that it's an encouragement.
[time=79] It's an encouragement to me and so I mean it when I say it I know that there are all kinds of people out there watching, there are older people, younger people, there are folks who have walked with the Lord for years and years and there are some of you watching on a regular basis and you've yet to really cross over that line of faith but God is at work in you and you're asking the right questions and we are just thrilled to be a part of your life and I'm thankful that you tune in each and every week.
[time=109] As you watch this this morning for most of you it's the 13th of May and for you moms watching I wanna say a special welcome to you it's Mother's Day as you watch this and we are so thankful for the tireless, faithful, loving, gracious and kind effort that you bring as a mother.

[time=407] - Hey, I'm really grateful for the job, Jesse Hannah did last week, so thankful that we have people who can, yeah, absolutely.
[time=416] (audience applauding) You have no idea, you really don't, how grateful I am.
[time=423] To be a part of a place, to be a part of a team that more and more so as the days go by doesn't rely on one person.
[time=431] I'm thankful for the variety of voices that God has given us here and thankful that guys like Steve Webster and Jesse and others can teach and explain the scriptures in a way that's beneficial for all of us and what Jesse did last week was phenomenal.
[time=447] I'm reminded of what's going on with worship, these last several weeks, I miss, we miss Corbin and Tanya.
[time=455] We hear from them, they're doing great over in the Czech Republic, ministry and life and being with the kids, it's all going pretty well.
[time=464] I know they miss us, we miss them, but in their absence, I'm thankful for Chris and for Adam and Hannah and others who have led us in worship, it's the sign of a healthy church, amen, when others can come and do ministry in a way and it allows us to keep moving forward.
[time=479] So really thankful for what Jesse did last week, he kicked off a new series that we've entitled, "Sent." And it has to do with the fact that anybody who has ever come into relationship with God, all the way back to Genesis chapter six and the first time he sent them out to today, you, anybody who has fully surrendered their heart and life to Christ, the scriptures teach us that part of God's design for you, part of being in the family of God is knowing that you have by God been sent.
[time=513] He never designed you to sit.
[time=521] He never designed us to be an immobile people who just gathered and that was it.
[time=528] No, he has from the beginning designed us to be a people who with all that he has given us and all that he has invested in us to be a people who are willing to go, to go and deposit that into lovingly and carefully and yet with great purpose deposit that into the hearts and lives of others, into the hearts and lives of those you live with, into the hearts and lives of those you work with, into the hearts and lives of others in unreached places across the globe, either way, as a believer, it is a mandate, it is part of his design, you've been sent.
[time=565] And so this morning we wanna continue with that thought, we wanna take you to Luke 8 in just a moment, but let me start this morning by asking you a question.
[time=572] Here's the question, you ready?
[time=573] I want you to answer this as honestly as you can.
[time=578] The thought of what?
[time=580] Specifically, the thought of what stirs you so deeply
[time=586] that you take, you can't help it, you are compelled to take determined action.
[time=593] The thought of what?
[time=596] What is it for you?
[time=599] You know, there's an answer to that question for every person in this room.
[time=604] There is something out there for you and the thought of it happening, the picture in your mind of it coming to pass sends you into orbit.
[time=613] If you could have this, if you could have this, you'll do about anything, go anywhere, pay any price, risk, any discomfort, what is that for you?
[time=626] The thought of what stirs you to a deep
[time=632] and determined action.
[time=633] You know, for some, this something that stirs them to action can at times be dark, detrimental, and not very God-honoring for many people today.
[time=649] That something that stirs them is the feeling of, take your pick, being drunk, being high,
[time=661] spending $1,000 at the mall, $1,000 that you don't have.
[time=666] For many people today, that's something
[time=673] that stirs them deeply, so deeply it moves them to action is visiting a certain website.
[time=681] For some people in this room, that website looks like this and for other people in the room, that website looks like this, but either way, something gets stirred deeply and it propels us to action.
[time=698] For some people, it's that greedy pursuit of more, more money, more fame, more toys, more trips, more control.
[time=706] Any number of addictive endeavors, all in an attempt to be free of or reduce life's pain, loneliness or guilt, and it can be very motivating,
[time=720] very motivating, it can get people to do crazy things.
[time=725] I learned about this.
[time=726] I learned about this cycle of being stirred deeply by something that then moves you to determined action.
[time=735] I saw that growing up in one of the most, it was an odd thing, it's one of the saddest, most tragic things and yet in some ways the most special thing to me I ever experienced.
[time=746] I found that whole experience to be true of my grandpa Joe, who I've told you about.
[time=752] Now don't know if I ever showed you a picture of Joe, but there he is.
[time=755] He's like, look at that, good looking dude, any?
[time=760] (audience laughs) Played a lot of golf, can you tell?
[time=764] Little bit Indian, he's got that going, amazing guy.
[time=768] Couldn't hear a thing, absolutely completely deaf.
[time=773] And he was an alcoholic.
[time=776] Boy was he an alcoholic.
[time=778] And I saw this get played out all through my years growing up and of all the things I witnessed and experienced, there may have been nothing more amazingly scary and at the same time funny looking back on it now than what happened on a Friday night in 1978.
[time=798] I played football at Saratoga High School near San Jose, California.
[time=804] I was 15 years old.
[time=806] That was Joe, here's me.
[time=809] Oh gosh, that hurts me.
[time=810] (audience laughs) Hurts me.
[time=813] Yes, that hair is feathered.
[time=818] That's me, that's actually me at 18.
[time=823] So you get a minus three years, I'm 15 years old.
[time=826] I'm playing football at Saratoga High School.
[time=828] Football was huge and they would pack the stadium down at Helmsfield.
[time=832] The stadium wasn't at the school.
[time=835] It was down by town, by the city.
[time=838] And so everybody would come and then after the game they'd bus us back to the high school.
[time=841] And it was kind of a routine where you'd get down with the game and you'd say hi to all the people, you'd get on the bus and you'd go back to the school and your mom would pick you up at your dad or you'd drive your car home.
[time=850] So that was what I was gonna do that night.
[time=852] First game of the season, September '78.
[time=854] I'm already on the bus.
[time=856] We've won, it was a great night.
[time=858] I got my pads off and my helmet off, sitting in the seat next to me and all of a sudden I hear this commotion outside.
[time=866] This car driving up, horn honking, people scattering.
[time=870] And I don't know what's going on until I hear the voice of my grandfather yelling from his favorite car.
[time=879] Boom, old '98, sweet ride, huh?
[time=883] And there's Grandpa Joe laying on the horn, stocking hat on a little cool that night.
[time=888] Yellen K-Buck, call me K-Buck, K-B-K-Buck, I don't know where he came up with these things.
[time=892] K-Buck, I'm hearing him yelling.
[time=895] K-Buck!
[time=896] And everybody's like, and he's just driving fast and he hits the brakes and he's right next to the bus and I've heard that voice and I knew that voice was drunk.
[time=905] And I get off, I grab my pads and I go running out to the car, I grab his head, I kiss him.
[time=913] And I'm like, you know, and he reeks lips really well and I just say, you know, chill out or something.
[time=918] I'm like, just wait and the coach comes up and he's like, hey, are you okay?
[time=922] Coach says, hey, are you okay?
[time=923] He's like in a car 15 feet away and he reeds his lips in the dark and he says-- He's fine!
[time=928] And I'm like, don't worry about him, I'm okay coach.
[time=933] I'm like, I think Grandpa's just gonna take me home and he says, are you sure?
[time=937] And I said, before I could say yes, he says-- He's sure!
[time=941] 'Cause he's reading everything he's saying, so they let me go 'cause he's just gonna drive me home.
[time=946] So I walk around the car, plot my pads and my helmet in the back, hop in the passenger's side and off me and Grandpa Joe go.
[time=952] Well, we get to the end of the parking lot away from the crowds, he stops the car, he looks at me, he says, K buck, I'm drunk.
[time=960] And I said, I know.
[time=962] And he said, here's the deal, we're not going home, we're going to Joe's.
[time=965] Original Joe's was a restaurant downtown San Jose, it was his favorite place, more than anything, the bartender there liked him.
[time=973] And so he told me, we're going to Joe's.
[time=976] And he's not doing real well, and I'm old enough to put two and two together, and I'm like, I don't know, Grandpa, he says, no, no, I gotta figure it out, gets out, walks around, opens my door, tells me to scoot over, he says, you're driving.
[time=993] I'm 15, I don't have my license, I haven't driven to the end of the block yet.
[time=999] And he says, there's just no getting around it, we're going to Joe's, you're driving, he gets this wool blanket out of the back, puts it around me, puts me behind the wheel, closes the door, throws it in drive, and says go.
[time=1011] So I drive my Grandpa Joe on a September night, 1978,
[time=1017] down the 280 freeway to downtown San Jose, about 40 miles an hour.
[time=1022] With him singing, he would sing hymns.
[time=1028] He grew up in the church, he would sing hymns, and you know, deaf people are loud, so he was just singing as loud as he could, one of the greatest memories of my life.
[time=1036] And we get to Joe's, and I get a big thing of pasta, and he orders his whiskey sour, and I get lost in the night, and it's about an hour later, and I realize, oh no, my mom was at the parking lot.
[time=1049] Oh, it was bad, ugly, ugly, ugly, called her from the phone at the restaurant, she's seething, and then she finds out who I'm with, she's even more upset, then she's going to come get me, and I say no, it's going to be okay, which I had no idea if it was going to be okay, I was just enjoying my pasta and my grandpa.
[time=1064] Anyway, long story short, we get back.
[time=1067] I drive us all the way back to my house, block away, 'cause we knew mom would be up front, so then he slides over, I go back over, we drive up, she's yelling and screaming, I get out, and I'll never forget that night talking to him about drinking.
[time=1081] And I remember him saying to me that the thought of a glass of whiskey, and the peace and quiet that it brought, and I thought, wow, he's deaf.
[time=1097] It was the first time I ever realized there really are voices.
[time=1102] The peace and quiet, he would tell me, that it brings, stirred him to do a lot of things.
[time=1112] Kid and half his grandson in September of '78,
[time=1118] put him behind the wheel of a car and go to Joe's, stirred so deeply, he took determined action.
[time=1127] You know, sometimes it's not dark and devious, but you still see the same principle at work, and I'm so thankful for this.
[time=1134] You know, sometimes the thought of being faithful, or filled with character, or of being a good mom, or dad, or exercising purity, or sharing your wealth, or meeting someone else's need, instead of yours, sometimes it's these things that compel us to go to great lengths.
[time=1151] Sometimes what stirs us deeply is bigger, and better, and beyond us.
[time=1157] Thank God.
[time=1158] And you're motivated to roll your sleeves up in a meaningful, determined, relentless way.
[time=1165] Either way, dark or light, good or bad, the thought of what stirs you.
[time=1175] What is it that really stirs you inside to a determined and relentless action?
[time=1184] We'll come back to that, all right?
[time=1188] We're gonna circle back to that very question, I promise you, but right now I want you to open your Bibles if you haven't already, to Luke eight.
[time=1195] Go to Luke chapter eight.
[time=1197] Luke chapter eight, one, what an interesting time
[time=1204] in the life and ministry of our Lord.
[time=1207] He's been at it for a bit, but now it kind of begins to move in a different direction.
[time=1211] Let me read, and I'll explain it.
[time=1214] Soon afterwards, he began, what's it say?
[time=1216] He began going around from one city and village to another, proclaiming and preaching the kingdom of God.
[time=1225] The 12 where he had been pretty stable for a while there.
[time=1228] He'd been kind of sitting tight, but now he begins to take it on the road, if you will.
[time=1233] The 12, the disciples were with him, and then how about this for an entourage, how counterculture is Jesus, and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses.
[time=1244] Had a bunch of ladies who had had disease and sickness and evil spirits, Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, and Joanna, the wife of Chousa, Herod Stewart, and Susanna and many others who were contributing to their support out of their private means.
[time=1264] Wow, what a picture that is.
[time=1267] What a picture of diversity.
[time=1269] What a picture of what so many of us, and I'm sure so many of them in that day wouldn't have expected.
[time=1275] You have the 12 disciples who were all a bunch of guys who didn't make the cut.
[time=1280] They were all a bunch of fishermen who didn't have enough smarts or brightness to really be disciples with the great rabbis of the day, and so he had picked them up, and now here are these ladies, and they go making their way through, used to be sick, used to be possessed, used to have demons, and now they didn't, and off they go to do ministry from city to city, village to village.
[time=1302] Now watch how this goes.
[time=1305] Verse four, when a large crowd, everybody say that, large crowd, large crowd, was coming together, and those from various cities were journeying to him.
[time=1320] He spoke by way of a parable, it says.
[time=1324] It just, again, so counter-cultural.
[time=1328] At a time, when all of a sudden now, if we had a big chart up here, and we were doing Jesus' ministry numbers, you know, we draw the two lines, I mean, now all of a sudden, it's skyrocketing up into the right.
[time=1342] I mean, he's traveling from village to village, city to city, and they're coming from everywhere to see him.
[time=1347] All of a sudden, the crowds are growing.
[time=1350] Why does he do this?
[time=1354] As the crowds are growing, he begins to speak in what?
[time=1357] Say it?
[time=1358] Parables.
[time=1359] You know what a parable is, right?
[time=1363] A parable is a confusing story, hard to understand where they profound truth, woven into it, woven into it in such a way you really, really got to follow.
[time=1375] You really got to track.
[time=1376] I mean, you really got to listen to sorta get it, and then you're probably going to have to come back and go through it again to really get it, but it's confusing.
[time=1385] Why do that?
[time=1389] Why, with the crowds showing up, do you get confusing?
[time=1395] You know why?
[time=1398] Because the Lord knew that the only way any of them were ever going to really, truly make it, was if they were willing to do the hard work of following him.
[time=1411] And that's still true today, by the way.
[time=1415] So he pushes them, he tests them with teaching and truth.
[time=1418] It's not easy to follow.
[time=1420] They're busting them in from all over the region, and he starts to thin out the crowd.
[time=1427] We want crowds.
[time=1432] This forces me and most of us to rethink some things.
[time=1438] See, we want crowds, don't we?
[time=1440] We want numbers.
[time=1441] We want the masses.
[time=1443] We want 'em piled in.
[time=1444] We think bigger is better.
[time=1446] We think more is best.
[time=1448] And yet he knew something.
[time=1451] He knew something here.
[time=1452] Following Jesus requires cost.
[time=1456] There's a price to be paid.
[time=1459] It costs more than most are willing to pay, and over time, don't miss this.
[time=1464] As you read through the Gospels and the ministry of Jesus, over time, oh, don't miss it, they left.
[time=1471] Go to the, his first, go to the feeding of the 5,000.
[time=1477] Most of you know that it was more than 5,000.
[time=1479] In those days they would count.
[time=1481] What we have is 5,000 were just the men.
[time=1483] They just counted the men.
[time=1484] When you get all the ladies and you get all the kids, that was probably most scholars say, about 18,000 people.
[time=1492] That were there in that field, in that canyon, and got fed, and they were amazed, and they were wowed, and it was the most incredible thing they'd ever seen, and we're coming back.
[time=1503] Especially if he feeds us.
[time=1504] Think about the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=1509] The greatest sermon ever given.
[time=1512] As Jesus kicks off his ministry.
[time=1515] If you've been to the Holy Land Day, they take you to the place where he gave the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=1520] And if you look at the geography of it, it's a natural amphitheater, if you will.
[time=1525] Probably 20,000 people were there.
[time=1530] In those early days going, whoo, this dude is awesome.
[time=1534] He's great, 20,000, 18,000, back at the big picnic.
[time=1540] And now I'll just have you fast forward to Acts chapter two.
[time=1548] Acts chapter two, now Jesus is gone.
[time=1550] Now he's been crucified.
[time=1551] The resurrection has occurred.
[time=1553] He has ascended up to the Father.
[time=1555] Now it's the ballgame.
[time=1559] I mean, now it's time.
[time=1560] And if you go to Acts two, many of you know this, those who were left were in a room.
[time=1569] It's a big room, because there were 120 of them.
[time=1578] Oh, there were thousands and thousands when he was making water into wine.
[time=1584] There were thousands when he was the big ticket in town, but now all of a sudden you gotta carry a cross.
[time=1592] Now all of a sudden you've gotta give your life.
[time=1594] Now all of a sudden there's great sacrifice.
[time=1598] Now we're at 120.
[time=1599] So as he fins out the crowds, he now jumps into the sower, the parable of the sower and the seed.
[time=1609] Let me read this for you.
[time=1610] Please read along with me.
[time=1611] He spoke by way of parable, then verse five.
[time=1615] The sower, he says, went out to sow his seed.
[time=1619] And as he sowed, some fell beside the road and it was trampled under foot and the birds of the air ate it up.
[time=1625] Other seed fell on rocky soil.
[time=1628] And as soon as it grew up, it withered away because it had no moisture.
[time=1633] Other seed fell among the thorns and the thorns grew up with it as it grew and the thorns choked it out, gone.
[time=1641] And then verse eight, other seed fell into the good soil and it grew up and produced a crop a hundred times as great.
[time=1652] And as he said these things he would call out, he who has ears to hear, let him hear.
[time=1659] He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
[time=1663] You know what you have here?
[time=1664] You got a few things, I want to just set some context.
[time=1666] I want you to understand what's happening.
[time=1668] We have the sower and the sower.
[time=1673] The sower is somebody in this analogy of the parable and it's spiritual implication.
[time=1679] The sower is somebody who wants to see, who desires to see, listen, the sower is somebody who's been stirred so deeply that they are moved toward determined action.
[time=1694] And they want to see a spiritual crop.
[time=1696] They want to see somebody come to faith.
[time=1699] And so you have a sower with his seed and the seed is the word of God.
[time=1705] The seed is more specifically the gospel.
[time=1707] It's the good news.
[time=1709] It's the kingdom of God.
[time=1710] It's the message of Jesus Christ and the life-changing eternity-altering effect he can have in a life.
[time=1718] So you've got this person who's been stirred deeply and they've got their bag of seed and they're going to throw seed.
[time=1724] And the seed is the word of God.
[time=1727] It's being preached, it's being shared, it's being offered.
[time=1731] And someone's desirous of a fruitful harvest.
[time=1735] Now what happens?
[time=1737] What happens as the seed gets thrown, preached, shared, offered?
[time=1743] What happens is it falls into four, as the parable goes, falls into four different realities.
[time=1749] There are four things that happen.
[time=1750] Some of you understand this.
[time=1751] Others of you don't, let me just bring you up to speed.
[time=1753] Number one, first batch throws, you know, and picture a field, picture a corn field, picture what you drive by and I drive by.
[time=1761] There's the field and then there's the edge of the field and then there's a little frontage road over on the side and then maybe even the highway.
[time=1767] But there's some that gets thrown over on the side, over on the road.
[time=1773] And the passage here, the parable says it gets trampled underfoot, the ground is hard and the birds come and eat it up.
[time=1780] Most scholars would say that he's referring here probably to the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
[time=1785] He may be referring to you.
[time=1788] It refers to anybody with a hard heart.
[time=1791] It refers to anybody with a proud, arrogant spirit who's basically saying, thanks, don't need it, I got this covered.
[time=1801] That hardness, seed doesn't penetrate, birds come, take it, done.
[time=1806] Next batch falls over, it says, into the rocky soil and it eventually withers.
[time=1812] And the rocky soil and the withering that takes place, you see it there in verse six, other seed fell on rocky soil as soon as it grew up, it withered because it had no moisture.
[time=1825] This is the, this is probably again, most scholars would say referring to the shallow, fickle, picky folks who were really there for the miracles.
[time=1835] They were there for the water and the wine, but now all of a sudden something's being asked of them and there's no moisture, there's no roots, there's nothing down below and it doesn't work and it's not gonna happen and boom, they're gone.
[time=1846] Then there's the thorns, thorns, choke it out.
[time=1849] I could just probably ask you and you'd come up with the answer, you know, you'd figure this out.
[time=1854] What chokes out, what chokes out faith?
[time=1858] Faith kind of starts to grow, but then what chokes it out, what chokes it out, wealth, sports, hobbies, career, you know, little gee gods that we worship.
[time=1875] That's what chokes out faith and the thorns are an example of that stuff getting choked out, but then some falls in the good soil, healthy soil.
[time=1885] All tilled up and ready to roll and the seed goes in and boom, sticks and grows, it's water, it's healthy.
[time=1891] A hundred times it says, a hundred times what they had hoped for, huge crop.
[time=1897] So I'm in a meeting, follow this.
[time=1901] I'm in a meeting recently and the guy coaching us and we're with a bunch of pastors and I love these sessions, we get to be coached by a guy who's been in ministry for years and years.
[time=1910] I love just getting encouraged, I love getting to listen to his wisdom and we're in this coaching session and he says to us, have you ever thought about the math in this passage?
[time=1921] And we all basically said, no, we're not mathematicians,
[time=1927] we're pastors, come on, you're killing us, what do you mean?
[time=1929] No, he said, have you ever thought about the math in this thing and the implications of the math?
[time=1937] He went on and said, have you ever just considered what Jesus and I'm asking you this morning to consider this?
[time=1946] He said, have you ever just considered what Jesus may have been saying about sharing our faith as sent people and people coming to faith in Christ?
[time=1956] Have you ever stopped and really thought about what this parable is saying about the process of making disciples and what it's like and what it entails and what happens?
[time=1968] He went on to challenge us by saying it was a parable.
[time=1973] He made it up, which Jesus could do, right?
[time=1978] And he could have made it up any way he wanted to and he went on to say, guys, listen, he could have said it's one and two, he could have made it a half.
[time=1991] He could have said the way the kingdom of God works is that there's seed that falls in bad soil and it doesn't go well and there's seed that falls in good soil and it's great and it is a 50% chance.
[time=2002] There you go, is that what he said?
[time=2004] Yes or no?
[time=2006] No, he could have said one and three.
[time=2008] He could have said good soil, sort of good soil, bad soil, that's how it goes, but he didn't say one and three and he didn't say one and two.
[time=2018] He said one and four.
[time=2021] He says one and four with graphic detail.
[time=2026] He says one and four, why?
[time=2030] Why does he say one and four?
[time=2033] What is the math of this passage?
[time=2037] Well, I'm gonna answer that for you.
[time=2038] I'm gonna try to answer that for you here in just a minute.
[time=2041] It's gonna be the second point we get to, here's three points for you, some things to consider regarding the sower, the seed and one in four.
[time=2048] You ready?
[time=2049] First of all, I'm gonna say this first, then we're gonna get to the answer, I believe, of why one and four, but first of all, write this down, the sower, the sower, through it everywhere.
[time=2060] I know that's pretty simple, but I don't want you to miss this in the parable, Jesus giving us direction on how we're to go about this, sharing of our faith, the sower throws it everywhere.
[time=2073] How do we know he threw it everywhere?
[time=2075] It ended up, where?
[time=2077] Everywhere.
[time=2078] It ended up on the road.
[time=2082] It ended up in the thorns.
[time=2083] It ended up in the middle of the field.
[time=2085] It was everywhere.
[time=2086] And here's what I do.
[time=2087] I won't speak for you, but man, here's what I do.
[time=2091] I go out every day of my life, and I get into all kinds of circumstances where I know there are people who are far from God, who quite possibly, I'm gonna cross their path and get to be for five minutes or 30, maybe a light to them.
[time=2104] And so I'm reaching in my pocket every day for my seed, and I don't know about you, but I walk into settings where I know it's there, and I grab my seed, and I start the conversation, or we're having lunch, or we're having coffee, and I say a few things, and all of a sudden I get this feeling inside that, you know what, I don't think so.
[time=2123] I don't think this is, I don't think the times right.
[time=2128] Say amen if you've ever done that.
[time=2131] I don't think you and I start playing God, and we start deciding arbitrarily, based on what?
[time=2139] Some subjective feeling, I don't think this is right, so I take my seed, I put it back in my pocket, and I don't throw it.
[time=2147] And I don't think, that's good.
[time=2151] I think you and I should be seed throwers.
[time=2154] We're gonna actually talk about this next week.
[time=2156] Week three and Cent is all about seed throwing, and we may actually even throw some, so wear a hat.
[time=2162] But I'm telling you, in this story,
[time=2168] I'm telling you the guy through it.
[time=2170] I think about Jeremiah, I think about the prophet Jeremiah.
[time=2173] Nobody listened, not one single person came to faith, nobody repented, he spent all of his years preaching the message God came to preach, and not one single response.
[time=2187] In fact, they threw him in a pit, they spit on him and heard him, and that was his life.
[time=2194] But wow, he kept throwing, what, seed.
[time=2200] I think about Steven throwing seed as they killed him.
[time=2203] I think about Paul, as he threw seed.
[time=2207] What do you say, beaten times without number?
[time=2209] Are you kidding me?
[time=2210] Can you imagine not being able to remember how many times you'd been beaten?
[time=2214] I think about the guy I flew on the plane with a few months ago, wonderful conversation, couple hours long, fascinating guy.
[time=2223] And I threw some seed, it was great, and he was listening, and we were talking, huge guy, very successful, very driven, a lot going on, plate full, headed to some important meetings.
[time=2236] Yet he's talking to me and hearing about my life, and I'm asking him about his, and we're getting ready to land, and I ask him a few pointed questions, and he says, whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on.
[time=2244] Listen, and please don't miss this, he says to me, I want you to know something, I respect what you do, but in case his words, but in case you haven't noticed, I'm fine.
[time=2256] I don't need, I don't need what you're offering.
[time=2261] Keep offering it, 'cause there are millions who do, he said, but I, I don't need it.
[time=2267] I think about this past Easter, and I know some of you know this about me, others of you may not, I live for Easter.
[time=2276] I live for Resurrection Sunday, it's the greatest day, maybe shy of a few kids' birthdays in an anniversary, glad I said that.
[time=2286] It's the greatest day in the world, amen?
[time=2289] Resurrection Sunday's the day, and I start getting ready, me, I start getting ready for Resurrection Sunday in January, every single year, I start making my list, I do, I get before God, and I look at my life, and I start to think, gosh, who can I ask, who can I invite to come and be with this family that I love as we celebrate this great, great day, in January, in February, in March, in April, it's just on my mind constantly, and in the settings that I get to be in, I try and throw seed, and I get to have those lunches or coffees, and the invitation gets made, and sometimes the invitation doesn't get made, sometimes I just get to be a friend and an encouragement, but sometimes invitations get made, and this year I got to invite eight.
[time=2332] I was so excited, I got to invite eight individuals to come and be with us that day, and I prayed and I begged God to do something special, and one came.
[time=2346] And I was just reminded.
[time=2347] It's hard, it's just, you gotta be faithful,
[time=2353] and it's gotta consume you, and you just gotta keep at it, and you gotta keep at it with a great heart that trusts God and loves people, and one came, and good things happened with the one, but I was just reminded, I was just reminded, seeing people come to faith as hard work, seeing people come to faith as hard work, that's why I think he went one and four, because it's tough, and it requires a great deal, and it's not easy.
[time=2380] So we're through it everywhere.
[time=2384] Seeing people come to faith as hard work, and lastly, you better throw bottom line conclusion, the mathematician and me concluded, and we did that day, you better throw more seed.
[time=2394] You better throw more seed, we'll talk about it next week.
[time=2400] But here's where I wanna leave this with you today.
[time=2404] Do you, and I'm asking you, and I'm asking you just to be honest with God, you don't even have to tell me, I'm asking you, do you really want to?
[time=2418] Do you?
[time=2421] Does the thought of God using you
[time=2428] with someone far from him to redemptively take steps, to invite them to a life-changing, eternity-altering truth?
[time=2437] Does the thought of you throwing seed and you being engaged, every single day, my friend Mitch Cruz, he taught me this phrase eight years ago, he taught it to our church over the years, and there's many of us who live with this phrase, every encounter, every encounter, a divine appointment, every single encounter, a divine opportunity
[time=2465] given to you by God.
[time=2467] Do you really want to live that way?
[time=2470] Truly.
[time=2473] There's the picture of someone far from God coming to faith in Christ, stir you deeply to take determined action.
[time=2482] You know why some people don't?
[time=2484] I just wrote this down, I'll read it to you.
[time=2486] You know why some people don't get very excited about seeing others come to salvation because they're not very excited about their own.
[time=2495] So many Christians today live such malnourished,
[time=2502] dysfunctional spiritual lives that when it comes to sharing your faith with others, it's like, why?
[time=2511] Why would I be excited about sharing with others about salvation when mine is so pathetic?
[time=2518] And weak and short-sighted and unfruitful and not meaningful, does that make sense?
[time=2525] The church is filled with people whose own salvation isn't at all what it should be.
[time=2531] So when it comes to sharing it with others, wow, it just falls flat.
[time=2536] And then you sit and you soak.
[time=2541] And it isn't at all.
[time=2542] And now we're back to what Jesse talked about last week.
[time=2545] Galilee in the Dead Sea, you know how it let you die.
[time=2548] Will you stand with us and worship again?
[time=2571] And faith can move out, let the mountains move,
[time=2579] because we're expectation, waiting here for you.
[time=2587] Waiting here for you.
[time=2601] You're the Lord of all creation.
[time=2604] And so you know my heart, the honor of salvation.
[time=2611] Your love is from the stars.
[time=2617] And waiting for you with our hands.
[time=2629] Lift it up and pray.
[time=2637] It's you, we too.
[time=2644] Sit on.
[time=2648] Ooh, yeah.
[time=2656] Everything you've lost.
[time=2662] Your faithfulness is true, and we're desperate for your forever.
[time=2670] All we need is you.
[time=2679] Waiting here for you.
[time=2684] With our hands.
[time=2687] Lift it up and pray.
[time=2695] And it's you, we too.
[time=2702] Singing all the things new, yeah.
[time=2766] Waiting here for you.
[time=2771] With our hands.
[time=2774] Lift it up and pray.
[time=2781] It's you, we too.
[time=2787] Singing all the things new, yeah.
[time=2801] Waiting here for you.
[time=2805] Singing all the things new, yeah.
[time=2815] And it's you, we too.
[time=2822] Singing all the things new, yeah.
[time=2853] And it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it.
[time=2869] Singing all the things new, yeah.
