[time=633] [MUSIC - 338 seconds]
[time=978] (upbeat music)
[time=1008] [MUSIC - 76 seconds]
[time=1087] (upbeat music)
[time=1093] [MUSIC - 149 seconds]
[time=1246] (upbeat music)
[time=1262] - Let's give him praise this morning.
[time=1264] (upbeat music) - Well, hey, open your Bibles
[time=1272] if you would this morning to Luke chapter eight.
[time=1276] Luke chapter eight, I want us to come back this morning to where we left off last week in the eighth chapter of Luke in this series that we have entitled "Sent." It is a three week series.
[time=1288] This is our third week.
[time=1290] We conclude these thoughts and this discussion this morning.
[time=1293] And as you turn back to Luke eight, I want to invite you again to join me in this discussion regarding the math.
[time=1300] That's right, if you missed it last week, the math of the sower and the seed, the parable of the sower and the seed.
[time=1308] I'll explain what I mean by the math here in just a moment.
[time=1311] Would you read it with me?
[time=1312] I'll read it, you listen, follow along.
[time=1314] Luke chapter eight versus four through eight.
[time=1317] When a large crowd was coming together and those from the various cities were journeying to him, he spoke by way of a parable.
[time=1325] Jesus now, speaking a parable to the crowds and he says the sower went out to sow his seed.
[time=1333] And as he sowed, some fell beside the road and it was trampled under foot and the birds of the air ate it up.
[time=1339] Other seed fell on rocky soil and as soon as it grew up it withered away because it had no moisture.
[time=1346] Other seed fell among the thorns and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out.
[time=1352] Other seed verse eight fell into the good soil and grew up and produced a crop a hundred times as great.
[time=1361] As he said these things, he would call out.
[time=1364] He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
[time=1368] And I would say and repeat that very thing to you this morning.
[time=1372] He who has ears to hear.
[time=1375] This morning I pray that you will hear the word of God.
[time=1380] The math, the math.
[time=1382] What do we mean by this?
[time=1384] We saw from a careful reading of the passage that the numbers, if you will, the percentages from the passage reveal just how difficult it is at times to actually see someone truly and genuinely embrace the person of Christ as their Savior and Lord.
[time=1402] The percentages that kind of play themselves out in Luke eight show us how difficult and challenging it is sometimes to see a disciple made.
[time=1413] The math of the parable showed us that it wasn't one and two, wasn't.
[time=1420] If you were here last week, you remember, it wasn't one and two.
[time=1422] This isn't a 50%, 50, 50 proposition.
[time=1427] He didn't, he made up the parable the way he said it.
[time=1430] He could have said there was good soil and bad.
[time=1432] He didn't say that.
[time=1433] It wasn't one and two and it wasn't one and three.
[time=1435] No, the way Jesus plays this thing out, the picture he paints is one and four.
[time=1441] And he does it with great detail.
[time=1444] One in four, find good soil, produce roots and a crop a hundred times as great.
[time=1453] Only 25% of the time when spiritual seeds get thrown here in Luke eight, do we see spiritual fruit?
[time=1462] So we deduced a few things from this.
[time=1465] So number one, if, and I'll say that to you again, if you're truly genuinely interested in partnering with God and seeing people you know who don't really follow Christ, come to know him in a personal life-changing way if you're genuinely interested in that.
[time=1486] And some admitted last week that maybe you're not.
[time=1492] And two, if only a fourth of the seed-throwing efforts bear fruit then we concluded last week that we might wanna throw more, what?
[time=1504] We might wanna throw more seed.
[time=1508] Now, remember this about the seed.
[time=1510] What do we mean by the seed?
[time=1511] What is the seed that gets thrown?
[time=1513] The seed is our efforts to share with people the word of God.
[time=1517] The seed is our efforts to share with people the gospel, the good news that there's a better life in Christ.
[time=1526] The seed that we're talking about here is your efforts and mine to help those that we love come to a place of faith in Christ.
[time=1535] See, see this is the seed, this effort of ours.
[time=1539] And I know as well as you know that sometimes this seed-throwing effort, this truly remarkable opportunity we have to partner with God in the seed-throwing endeavor.
[time=1552] We know that sometimes it's challenging.
[time=1554] Watch this and just identify with how this goes at times and we're gonna come back and talk about this very thing.
[time=1562] - Jesus, I am just so excited today.
[time=1568] It's like I just woke up this morning and I thought today is the day I get working for Jesus.
[time=1573] - And Emily, I'm so excited to find someone who's willing to take action and get something done.
[time=1578] - Man, I am that girl.
[time=1580] - Exactly, and I've got the perfect thing for you.
[time=1582] So let's get started.
[time=1583] First, what are you doing?
[time=1585] Stand up, come on, let's go, we got stuff to do.
[time=1587] - Yeah, no, this is where I always sit.
[time=1590] - Right, but I want more from you.
[time=1592] - Oh, oh, I see what you're getting at.
[time=1596] Okay, Jesus, how much do you want?
[time=1599] Is $50 enough?
[time=1601] - That's not what I meant.
[time=1604] - Oh, okay, 100 then.
[time=1607] But you drive a hard bargain there, okay.
[time=1610] But you might not want to cash this until like next Friday, okay?
[time=1614] - Emily, Emily, I do think it's great that you want to give, but I had something different in mind.
[time=1623] I want you to mentor a younger woman.
[time=1625] - Oh, yeah, see, Jesus, I just, I don't really get into like teaching and stuff.
[time=1630] You know, it's just really not my thing.
[time=1633] - Okay, you know that woman at work, Amy?
[time=1636] - Yeah.
[time=1637] - Yeah, I want you to take her out to lunch and tell her about me.
[time=1640] - Oh, yeah, see, here's the thing.
[time=1642] Amy, she's different.
[time=1645] I mean, like, she's really different, you know?
[time=1648] - Yeah, I know, but she needs to hear about me.
[time=1651] - Oh, I know.
[time=1654] I'm just gonna tell the people at church to give her a call.
[time=1657] It's easy 'cause they get paid to do that sort of thing.
[time=1660] - But Emily, I want you to do it.
[time=1662] - Oh, yeah, see, Jesus, I'm just not comfortable doing that.
[time=1668] - No, Emily, the problem is, you're too comfortable.
[time=1672] (gentle music) - Yeah, short, quick, into the point,
[time=1692] but I think you got the point.
[time=1695] And we're gonna pick it up right there.
[time=1697] We're gonna actually come back to that very thing, this idea of partnering with the Lord and throwing seed.
[time=1703] We're gonna make our way back to that truth in just a moment, but before we do that, I said something last week that I want to come back to this morning and it'll all kind of come together at the end, I promise.
[time=1715] And I'm gonna come back to what I said last week by way of kind of restating the foundational framework of our series.
[time=1723] So let me just, let me say it to you this way, that these past two weeks we've been looking closely at God's design for all of us who are fully devoted to Him.
[time=1734] So again, let me just say this, it's important that you hear this and at least acknowledge this as we go on in the discussion this morning.
[time=1741] If you have fully surrendered your heart and life to Him, if you are a follower of the Son of God, then what we're about to say has direct implication in your life, not because I say so, but because of God's design.
[time=1756] Because what we've been talking about, what Jesse showed us two weeks ago, what I began to talk you through last week is that God's design, His plan from day one, has been that the people of God, those who are His, would reach out to those who are far from God, empowered by the Spirit of God and the Word of God to invite them into a life-changing relationship with God.
[time=1785] I wanna repeat that in case you missed it.
[time=1788] God's design, His plan from day one, has been that the people of God would reach out to those far from God, but they would do so empowered by the Spirit of God and the Word of God to invite them into a life-changing relationship with God.
[time=1805] We've been talking about how God's design, really God's desire has always been that people, the people of God would go.
[time=1815] His desire has always been that those who know Him would go and represent Him.
[time=1820] I think about a number of passages, right down to Hebrews 11-8.
[time=1825] Let me read to you what it says in Hebrews 11-8.
[time=1830] It says, "By faith," which is oftentimes needed when we're going, right?
[time=1834] "By faith," Abraham, when he was called, obeyed God by going out to a place which he was to receive foreign inheritance.
[time=1844] And he went out not knowing where he was going.
[time=1849] From the very beginning, God has been sending his people to reach the nations.
[time=1855] From the very beginning, God has been sending his people to reach out to those far from him, depositing, passing along as they go.
[time=1865] God's love, God's grace, his truth, God's kindness, his law, depositing these things into the hearts and lives of others.
[time=1872] You and I, Christians, followers of Christ, have been sent.
[time=1877] And Jesse took us to Matthew 28 in week one of this series,
[time=1884] the classic passage that describes and poignantly points out for everybody, the clear sending, the clear commissioning, if you will, of all believers.
[time=1895] Let me take you to Romans 10.
[time=1897] Go to Romans, open your Bibles this morning to Romans chapter 10.
[time=1900] I wanna show you something else about this biblical reality of you and I as believers being sent.
[time=1908] And here's the point I made.
[time=1910] Here's where I'm making my way back to the point I made last week.
[time=1914] I wanna come back to it this morning.
[time=1916] Romans 10, verse nine, all the way through 15.
[time=1920] Follow me here.
[time=1921] That if you confess with your mouth, Jesus as Lord, it says, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
[time=1930] Here we have seed that is taking root in good soil and salvation is transpiring, you shall be saved.
[time=1939] For with the heart, a person believes resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth, he confesses resulting in salvation.
[time=1948] For the scripture says, "Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed." Thank God for verse 12.
[time=1955] For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, no distinction between rich and poor, no distinction between red, yellow, black, or white, no distinction between anybody, any race, any ethnicity, any medium income, nothing.
[time=1974] No distinction, verse 12, for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding and riches for all who call on him, for whoever, listen, for whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be what?
[time=1988] Say it, say it.
[time=1991] How then, verse 14, how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed?
[time=1999] How's this gonna work?
[time=2002] How will they believe in him whom they have not heard of?
[time=2007] And how will they hear without a preacher?
[time=2012] And how will they preach unless they are what?
[time=2017] Say it, there it is.
[time=2020] Just as it is written, how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news of good things.
[time=2028] We got some birds in here?
[time=2029] (congregation laughing) It's kind of a family joke.
[time=2033] (congregation laughing) I was back in the back in between services, and I heard him, and I'm like, you gotta be kidding me.
[time=2041] How did they get, I thought they were back in the back back, so they're in here.
[time=2044] Are they flying around?
[time=2045] All right, you're right.
[time=2048] So maybe he's gonna do his thing, I don't know.
[time=2052] But if he does, I'm more at risk than you.
[time=2054] So we'll just, we'll take this as the enemy trying
[time=2060] to distract you from the message, and we're all gonna focus everybody's eyes right here.
[time=2063] Come on class, right here.
[time=2065] Everybody's eyes right here.
[time=2066] Forget about the bird, that one, not this one.
[time=2069] (congregation laughing) Wow, so here's the point I made last week.
[time=2075] I can't remember it if you paid me right now.
[time=2080] (congregation laughing) Oh, I know what it was, I know what it was.
[time=2084] Here it is, it's verse 14.
[time=2086] When you see the word, see, they can't believe if they haven't heard, and they can't hear unless there's a preacher, and when you read the word preacher, you think of who?
[time=2097] Say it, me, wrong, (buzzer) wrong answer.
[time=2103] That word preacher in the original language is not me.
[time=2109] It is not paid clergy.
[time=2112] It is not what that means.
[time=2113] That word preacher means passionate communicator.
[time=2118] And passionate communicator doesn't mean seminary trained.
[time=2123] Passionate communicator doesn't mean 30 years saved with a closet full of iguana stickers.
[time=2131] (congregation laughing) Passionate communicator doesn't mean scholar.
[time=2136] It doesn't mean gifted teacher.
[time=2142] No, that word preacher means passionate communicator.
[time=2148] It means somebody who's willing to open their what?
[time=2153] Mouth, because there's something inside them that means the world to them, and it means so much to them they can't keep their what closed, their mouth.
[time=2166] People come to faith, according to Romans 10, 14, by way of a passionate communicator, someone who is convinced, someone who feels it deeply, someone who is all in, and maybe, maybe, just maybe, you're not seeing a lot of people in your world moving closer to Christ, because maybe you are.
[time=2191] But maybe you're not, because you're just not a very passionate communicator.
[time=2200] Maybe you don't really live out your faith as if you are utterly convinced.
[time=2206] Maybe yours isn't an all-in faith.
[time=2212] Maybe there's just not much in you that you wanna open your mouth about.
[time=2219] Too many Christians don't feel it deeply.
[time=2221] For way too many so-called Christians today, the good news of the gospel hasn't carried over into a good life in relationship with Christ.
[time=2231] They're not faithful.
[time=2232] Too many believers, not joyful, not content.
[time=2235] They're not experiencing the thrill of obedience and spiritual growth.
[time=2239] They don't allow devotion to God to be more fulfilling than life in the flesh.
[time=2246] They pursue compromise instead of commitment.
[time=2249] They choose worldly pleasure over godly value.
[time=2253] And so when someone far from God needs a preacher, when someone far from God is right there in front of them and they need a passionate, deeply convinced follower of Christ, too many of us are silent.
[time=2266] Nothing to say.
[time=2270] Blank it over our laps, remote in hand, sitting there on the recliner, comfortable.
[time=2275] We're thinking about this in my own life.
[time=2282] And I'll say it to you right now.
[time=2285] I know that there are many of you who I would guess you assume I've got this dialed in my life.
[time=2290] And you think I have it all dialed in in my life because I tell you at times about the conversations I have on the plane.
[time=2298] Well, the truth is I tell you about the conversations I had on the plane.
[time=2303] I don't tell you about the hundreds of conversations on the plane I never had because I'm like you.
[time=2311] Sometimes I just don't open my mouth.
[time=2316] Sometimes it just doesn't stir me.
[time=2318] Sometimes there's things going on in my own life that just keep me from overflowing with a message of hope.
[time=2325] Sometimes I'm scared.
[time=2329] Sometimes I'm preoccupied.
[time=2330] I was thinking about this in the day.
[time=2332] About a year and a half ago, a buddy of mine, Bob, give me a book called "Unbroken." And I like it when people give me books.
[time=2341] Sometimes it's hard because I feel obligated to read them and I got a lot of books I'm trying to read and so oftentimes I don't get to it but there was something about this book.
[time=2348] My buddy Bob gave me, it's called "Unbroken." It's the story of Louis Zamperini.
[time=2354] It's the, the subtitle is a World War II story of survival, resilience, and redemption.
[time=2360] And it just captured me reading the title of "The Front." And I opened this thing up, big, old, thick, true story.
[time=2367] I opened this thing up one night and I put it down 13 nights later done.
[time=2374] Every single waking moment of my day for the most part spent, every break I had.
[time=2380] I had it on my iPhone and I would read it at stoplights.
[time=2385] I couldn't put it down.
[time=2386] It was scintillating.
[time=2387] It was captivating.
[time=2388] It was like, oh my gosh, every page you're going, this can't get any worse and it would.
[time=2395] And then it started getting better and you didn't think it could get any better and then, oh, it gets better.
[time=2400] And then worse and better and unbelievable story.
[time=2403] Louis Zamperini, unbroken.
[time=2405] I must have told, I must have told 100 people.
[time=2409] There's probably a thousand people in the world who have read that book because of me.
[time=2414] I became a, I became a preacher with the message of unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand,
[time=2424] author of "Sea Biscuit." Everywhere I, people got sick of hearing from me.
[time=2429] My friends are going, oh, there he goes, talking about unbroken again.
[time=2434] A book, I had no doubt.
[time=2439] I had no fear with great passion.
[time=2445] I knew anyone with a clear head in the functioning heart would be totally captivated.
[time=2451] I told everybody.
[time=2452] But boy, I'll tell you, I'll sit on a plane with a message of hope and eternity in my heart and sleep.
[time=2464] And not be bothered by the gallant work, whatever, we've all been there.
[time=2472] You know, sometimes when it comes to helping others toward faith, sometimes I think we're afraid.
[time=2478] Sometimes I think we're scared.
[time=2483] Sometimes we just don't walk closely enough with him to be stirred that much.
[time=2487] But I really do think sometimes we're afraid, scared, and unsure.
[time=2490] Raise your hand if you agree with me.
[time=2493] Yeah, I think it's very true.
[time=2494] And I want to just, for those of you who raised your hand this morning, I want to just remind you of something so very important for you to remember and understand, please note that those 12 guys that he left behind on that hill, those 12 guys, when Jesus ascended and said this whole ballgame now is up to you, those 12 guys, they were not the most courageous.
[time=2517] They were not the strongest.
[time=2519] They were not the most gifted, confident, fearless group in the world, right?
[time=2524] Not at all.
[time=2526] No, and Jesus knew it.
[time=2529] God was very aware of that, which is why in John 14, 26, Jesus tells them, hey, by the way, when I'm gone, God's gonna send you a what?
[time=2539] Say it, say it louder.
[time=2542] I help her.
[time=2543] Now, who in the room, when you think about throwing seed, who in the room, when you think about this opportunity that God gives us, who in the room would raise your hand and go, hey, on that front, I could really use some help.
[time=2559] Yeah, you and I both, John 14, 26, but the helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, He will teach you all things.
[time=2569] This is after Jesus is gone and I love this part and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.
[time=2576] How many times have you been in those conversations and thought, oh, I wish I could remember what Kelly said or what I heard in that message or what I read, and then boom, you remember it.
[time=2588] It gets clear and you communicate it as best you can, it's the Holy Spirit of God that resides in you sent by God to do among other things, to give you strength and remembrance and clarity as you throw seed and have conversations and ask questions and make invitations.
[time=2607] Wow.
[time=2608] You and I have been sent.
[time=2612] We have been sent to throw seed and we better throw
[time=2618] as much as we possibly can, as often as we can.
[time=2623] I don't think there's anything wrong.
[time=2625] There's nothing wrong with the product.
[time=2628] I'll just say it that way.
[time=2629] There's anything wrong with the gospel.
[time=2631] What's wrong is you and me sometimes live malnourished, unstirred, unconvinced, disengaged, spiritual lives.
[time=2640] Wow, now we've got problems.
[time=2643] (audience laughing) Need my son with his pellet gun.
[time=2653] That's what we need.
[time=2656] Hey, Jake, just to kill this thing.
[time=2658] Anyway, sorry for you bird lovers, that was just a joke.
[time=2662] (audience laughing) I can't wait to see how this plays on the Bible hour.
[time=2667] Slow motion of the bird flying in front of bird.
[time=2672] Here I go again with my bird jokes.
[time=2674] Hey, one last thing, we'll wrap this up.
[time=2679] One last thing, we know we've studied the gospels as elders and staff here at Blackhawk.
[time=2685] We have scoured the gospels and the book of Acts in recent years, trying to understand and better define what true genuine followers of Christ looked like, how they lived, what they valued.
[time=2699] It's where we came up with our five elements, the marks of a disciple.
[time=2704] And as you study this, I want to just say this to you.
[time=2706] I'm not trying to be dramatic.
[time=2707] I'm not trying to be manipulative.
[time=2708] I just want you to hear this.
[time=2710] That one of the marks of a true follower of Christ
[time=2716] is that they have a desire to make more followers of Christ.
[time=2721] And if you don't have a desire,
[time=2727] then I would just invite you to consider the state and the condition of your faith.
[time=2736] Because the scriptures are really clear that those who know him and those who followed after him were like him and he certainly had this burning, stirring desire to see those far from him come to faith.
[time=2750] And so I would just invite you to think about that and to consider that.
[time=2754] Throwing seed, I told you we'd come back to this.
[time=2757] So let me just say this to you.
[time=2758] Here's some things to keep in mind.
[time=2760] I don't want to say it's a framework.
[time=2762] I don't want there to be really any framework necessarily for you.
[time=2766] I want you to leave this place today willing to consider how it is that you can as a believer throw more seed in your life.
[time=2774] And I don't want to hem you in.
[time=2776] I don't want to say it has to look a certain way.
[time=2779] But I do want to just give you some things from the scriptures this morning that kind of paint an outline, if you will, of situations or circumstances from the word of God.
[time=2788] This is really tough.
[time=2790] Sit, you try to focus here, okay, whatever he does, just try and let's just try and get through this here.
[time=2797] Situations from the word of God, where we see seed being thrown in a number of different ways and you can just write these down and then we'll be done.
[time=2806] Write this word down, relationally.
[time=2810] Relationally, there are times where you get the opportunity and I get the opportunity to because of a friendship that has been established for genuine motives because you love someone, because you care for them.
[time=2822] This could be a family member, this could be a partner at work, this could be a team member, this could be a classmate, this could be a neighbor.
[time=2829] But oftentimes, relationally, God gives this opportunity to throw seed.
[time=2833] I was thinking about Jesus and Nicodemus in John three.
[time=2837] Interesting thing about Nicodemus in John three.
[time=2840] In John three, one through eight, the story is told of a religious leader in that day who came to Jesus in the middle of the what, not the middle of the day, but the middle of the what.
[time=2851] He came in the middle of the night, culturally then even culturally now it would be clear to them that anybody who came in the middle of the night, your friend, you don't just go to someone in the middle of the night that you don't know.
[time=2865] Something had been established there where he comes in the middle of the night and asks these deep spiritual questions about what it means to be born again.
[time=2877] And Jesus and Nicodemus enter into this personal discussion about enormously important things.
[time=2885] And it's what happens when you make that investment.
[time=2888] It's what happens when that investment's genuine.
[time=2890] It's what happens when you have a friend who you care for and who you're willing to engage in discussions about not only eternity, but a meaningful today.
[time=2901] Relationally, sometimes we get to throw seed.
[time=2905] We get to engage in conversations and buy God's grace and with his help point people who we love toward faith.
[time=2912] Proclamationally, let me say that word.
[time=2915] Proclamationally, sometimes we get to throw seed.
[time=2918] What I mean by that is Acts 2, 14.
[time=2922] Look at Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts.
[time=2925] Look at Acts 2, 14.
[time=2926] I love the way this even just sounds reading it.
[time=2929] 'Cause sometimes you know what, sometimes seed gets thrown when somebody stands up and speaks.
[time=2934] It's true, might seem old fashioned, but it's true.
[time=2936] I love what it says there now.
[time=2938] But Peter taking his stand.
[time=2940] This is the day of Pentecost.
[time=2942] The Holy Spirit has come down now.
[time=2945] They have been sent and now they have been empowered.
[time=2948] And so Peter taking his stand with the 11 raised his voice and declared to them men of Judea.
[time=2957] And all you who live in Jerusalem, this would be Times Square.
[time=2963] This would be raising your voice and just shouting it out for those who have ears to hear.
[time=2971] This is what I do in a sense.
[time=2974] In a sense, this is what I do on a Sunday morning.
[time=2976] We proclaim the gospel, seed gets thrown.
[time=2980] You know what though?
[time=2981] This is what you do.
[time=2982] Really, this is what you can do at a lunch table.
[time=2985] You can proclaim what's true and what you believe.
[time=2990] This is what you do in a number of different settings where you might have the opportunity to speak.
[time=2996] This is a way in which you can proclaim and communicate the foundation of your faith.
[time=3003] This may be in a group of 10.
[time=3006] It may be with a couple of thousand.
[time=3008] But either way, seed gets thrown when someone's willing to stand up and say it a little bit louder, not obnoxiously.
[time=3015] This is exactly what like it or not.
[time=3017] Follow it or not.
[time=3019] I tend to follow the sports world.
[time=3020] This is what Tim Tebow does.
[time=3025] He proclaims in a, usually a short sentence or two, what he believes and you may like him or not like him, but I'll tell you what, you have no question about what he believes through service.
[time=3039] Sometimes we throw seed relationally, sometimes we throw seed proclamationally, sometimes we sow seed through service.
[time=3045] I want you to see this.
[time=3046] Acts chapter two, go to verse 43.
[time=3052] Everyone, this is the early church.
[time=3053] Now all of a sudden the spirit of God has moved, the gospels going forward, amazing things are happening.
[time=3058] Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles and all those who had believed were together and had all things in common and look at 45 and they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with, say that word, as, next word, might have need.
[time=3086] Now I know I've heard the discussions and there are people who think that's just talking about believers.
[time=3093] There are people who think they just were this kind of holy cluster and they just saw their possessions and shared all they had so they could simply just take care of themselves.
[time=3104] I don't believe, I don't believe that's what this is saying.
[time=3107] I believe all means what?
[time=3110] All, I believe that the people of God in those early days shared with those in their community, shared with those in their region, I believe they were a giving gracious kind people who reached into the hearts of others because of their generosity and their message.
[time=3130] Who do you have in your life?
[time=3133] I'm asking you, who has a physical need?
[time=3136] Who needs help in the yard?
[time=3139] Who needs help at home?
[time=3140] Who needs help in the kitchen?
[time=3142] Who needs help in any way, shape, or form that you could offer your time and your energy and your heart to go and meet a need?
[time=3151] Believe the spirit of God is at work as you and I go and do the very same thing Jesus did.
[time=3158] He met needs, seed gets sown, relationally, proclamationally, through service.
[time=3165] In community, please write that down.
[time=3167] In community, seed gets sown.
[time=3170] But right there it acts, 2.46, day by day.
[time=3175] All this was going on in the context of what?
[time=3178] Day by day, continuing with one mind in the temple, breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart.
[time=3189] Praising God and having favor with, say it, all the people.
[time=3195] People of God living in rich community, sharing with those in need has a way of throwing seed.
[time=3204] It has a way of impacting those on the outside looking in.
[time=3208] You don't think so?
[time=3209] And the Lord was adding to their number, day by day, those who were being what, say it, saved.
[time=3216] So I would just ask you, how in your Sunday morning ABF, how in your regular small community that you're a part of, how are you intentionally looking for ways to go and serve and meet needs?
[time=3232] I hope we believe, if you're part of this family, that the word of God is part of your community, we believe that prayer is a part of your community.
[time=3241] We believe that encouraging each other is a part of your community, but oh my goodness, what an opportunity God has given you.
[time=3249] In community, through service, even proclamationally, relationally.
[time=3255] And then the last bullet point I've got here is a question mark.
[time=3258] And I just leave it with you this morning.
[time=3260] How should you, how should you throw some seed this week?
[time=3267] What conversations could you have?
[time=3269] What effort could you make?
[time=3271] What invitation could you extend for them to come and join you here in this place?
[time=3278] I had somebody first hour say, oh, why did you say that?
[time=3281] Why did you say come join you in this place?
[time=3286] And I'm like, what did I give it away?
[time=3288] I mean, like, they don't know why you're inviting them to come to this place?
[time=3294] Or do they think it's like an amway thing?
[time=3296] Or, I mean, the people I invite, and I invite them constantly.
[time=3302] Very aware of why I'm inviting them here, and it's not an arrogant thing.
[time=3307] It's an honest, genuine thing.
[time=3309] I want them to listen and hear and consider the truth that I know they're gonna experience.
[time=3315] And so, yeah, we don't make it a secret.
[time=3317] It's not like some awkward deal.
[time=3318] You may be here today with somebody who invited you.
[time=3322] I hope I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.
[time=3324] Here it is, they love you.
[time=3326] There.
[time=3328] They love you.
[time=3330] And they want you to be able to hear the truth.
[time=3334] They want seed to get close to you.
[time=3337] And they're praying that God would do something special with that, and so are we.
[time=3342] So are we.
[time=3343] Would you stand this morning?
[time=3344] Let me pray for us as we go.
[time=3347] Our Father in Heaven, we're grateful.
[time=3351] Even in the midst of distraction, your word has gone forward, and your word says it won't return void.
[time=3359] And so I know that there are people in this room who have listened.
[time=3364] They have heard one communicate, and the truth is taking root in them today, and I pray God that there would be those who would come to faith in the days to come.
[time=3374] Oh, I pray God that there would be those in this room who would be willing to share with others in their world, that they would show themselves to be true disciples by a willingness and a readiness to throw seed in a loving, appropriate kind way.
[time=3394] Oh, Father in Heaven, if there would be anybody in this room this morning standing here, sitting here in this room, and they've yet to fully surrender their heart and life to you.
[time=3405] I just pray God that right here in this moment that they would just take the time to honestly say in their own words, before you right here, they would just say, oh God, I know my sin has separated me from you.
[time=3424] And God, the more I hear about life and relationship with you and your son, the more I want that.
[time=3429] And so God, this morning, I commit my life to you.
[time=3433] Oh God, I commit to follow you.
[time=3435] I commit to honor your word.
[time=3438] I commit to learn more about all that it says, oh Father, forgive me of my sin.
[time=3443] Save me and make me new, restore me and rebuild me.
[time=3448] Oh God, if there's anybody in the room saying those things to you this morning, we know that you will save them.
[time=3457] And we're grateful for that.
[time=3460] It does stir us and it does remind us of what is most important in life.
[time=3465] God, give us courage and strength to be your people as we go concerned about and given to the right things at the right time.
[time=3476] Thank you for the privilege of gathering.
[time=3477] Thank you for the privilege of worship this morning.
[time=3480] Thank you for our moms, be with them and bless them today.
[time=3484] We pray in your son's name.
[time=3486] And everybody agreed and said, amen.
[time=3488] God bless you.
[time=3489] Have a great day.
[time=3490] (upbeat music)
