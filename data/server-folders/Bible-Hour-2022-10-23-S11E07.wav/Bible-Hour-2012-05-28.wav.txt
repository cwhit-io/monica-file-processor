[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] [MUSIC - 187 seconds]
[time=222] (audience applauds) - I forgot to tell him the first hour,
[time=232] but it's a little obvious that Tanya's pregnant, so that's kind of some good news for us.
[time=238] (audience applauds) We found out like the week we were flying away, so she's just like, ugh, okay, morning sickness and year up.
[time=247] Here we go, see what happens.
[time=250] It went really well and it was good and God was faithful in the midst of that.
[time=253] She's 12 weeks along and due December 5th, right in the middle of Christmas with Black Hawk, I'm sure that'll be easy.
[time=260] (audience laughs) What were we thinking?
[time=263] But we're excited about it and we got a great doctor's report that brain development is healthy and normal, so that's exciting.
[time=270] (audience applauds) Wanted to share another story with you about our trip,
[time=279] just cool how God brought our world together with a family from Romania and a cool thing happened.
[time=289] During our time with Josiah Adventure, they asked us to be a part of their missionary conference.
[time=294] Every year, they have all 220 workers from 12 different countries get together with their families to connect relationally, grow spiritually and just kind of refuel for whatever God has for the next 12 months of ministry that they do.
[time=310] And last year, they asked Tonya and I to come and work with their children and we got a chance to do it again this year.
[time=315] My mom's and dad's are learning and we're shipping.
[time=317] We're with the kids, the great schoolers, working on a program that they present to mom and dad at the end of the five days.
[time=324] So it's intense and it's fun and we do some crazy songs and have a good time.
[time=329] Two of the kids that we get to work with are from Romania and I think we've got a picture of them with their mom and dad, Ioana and Johnny are the two kids from Romania.
[time=341] So we knew who they were last year but what we didn't know was that at last year's conference, their mom over on the right, Rodica, had been diagnosed with cancer.
[time=352] We didn't know about that the year before but we found out this year when we showed up that she had passed away the month prior.
[time=359] So we get to engage with these kids in a really painful experience and kind of freaked this out 'cause we're not really child psychiatrists at all and we didn't really know how to, you didn't want to ignore the topic and make it feel weird like we didn't care but we also didn't want to engage them on the topic of their mom's death and get them outside of their comfort zone or maybe break down emotionally in a weird spot and so I'm just like, Jesus help us figure this out 'cause I want to do what's right but I don't want to mess it all up either.
[time=393] And he answered that kind of pathetic prayer.
[time=396] And he answered it in a really cool way.
[time=399] We ended up getting some time alone with the kids, Johnny and Oana, before all the other kids showed up to the concert or conference rather.
[time=407] We got there early and they ended up being there early and we went up to their hotel room and just kind of said, "Hey, how's it going?
[time=414] "We had our kids with us." And we said, "Let's just play, let's have some fun." And they were teaching us some games and it was good and Tonya had even mentioned early on when we got to the room just, "Hey, we want you to know "and that we heard about your mom.
[time=428] "We're really sorry." And they just kind of said, "Thanks." But there was a wall there, you know what I mean?
[time=434] Like that was all they wanted to do is say, "Thanks." And we're like, "All right, let's play some cards.
[time=438] "It's fine." And so we did, we just hung out and played together for a little while and I felt like God was kind of directing me toward the end of that and I had my computer with me and I felt like he was asking me to show them some pictures of Zellie 'cause they knew her in utero.
[time=457] I mean, when we were at the conference last year, they knew about her and had been praying for us.
[time=461] So I just offered it and I said, "Would you guys like to see some pictures of our baby?" And we've got some pictures of the funeral and so we just started talking about it and I popped open the laptop and showed him pictures and they were excited to see and share in that part of our life and then what was really cool was as I started flipping through pictures little Johnny started saying, "Hey, we did something like that "at mom's funeral." It was so cool they hear him say, "Mom's funeral," 'cause they thought, "Ah, he's feeling comfortable "or we can talk about this." And then Yawana said something too about the stuff they did at the funeral, excuse me.
[time=498] And she said, "Can we go on a website?" 'Cause I think we've got a video of stuff that we did at mom's funeral and so we went to the website and they were showing us a balloon launch that they did and we heard all these romanians singing these beautiful worship songs and it was really, really cool and it was just fun because we got the kids to talk about their mom and what felt to me like a really natural way and a warm way and a comfortable way and then there were a few other things that happened that week where we got to engage them again about their mom and engage them with all the kids about their mom and it just felt really smooth and it felt godly.
[time=535] It felt like God had really directed it and his spirit was involved and it was really sweet and Tanya and I just looked at each other later and said, "You know, maybe this is what this trip "was all about." To just have a few moments with some kids who are really hurting in a really weak spot where they feel lost and pain and we get to do 2 Corinthians 1 and it show them the comfort that we've been comforted with by just talking about people we love who are with Jesus and it was really sweet and it was really good.
[time=567] A highlight of the trip for me, I know.
[time=569] This morning we're going to sing a song that talks about how God is for us in our weakness and you may be feeling weak today.
[time=578] Maybe it has to do with something painful like sickness or death but maybe there's other things that are just making you feel weak and I hope that this song encourages you because you need to be reminded in your weak state that God is not against you and that God has good plans for you, that He is for you and that His plans for you are to prosper you in the middle of your weakness and His plans are never to harm you with that stuff.
[time=604] So I hope that as we sing it, that it's just a breath of fresh air as the scriptures are sung over you this morning and maybe if you don't feel weak today, maybe you just want to pray while we sing for those kids on the screen or other people you know that are in a season of weakness, it's important for us to do that for one another.
[time=623] So let's do that while we sing this song.
[time=625] (gentle music)
[time=646] so faithful, so constant, so loving and so true, so powerful in all you do, you fill me, you see me, you know my every move, and you love for me,
[time=676] just sing to you, and I know that you are for me, I know that you are for me, I know that you will never, for take me in my weakness, and I know that you have come now,
[time=702] here I live to run upon my heart, to remind me who you are.
[time=730] So patient, so gracious, so merciful and true, so wonderful in all you do, you fill me, you see me, you know my every move,
[time=758] and you love for me, just sing to you, Lord I know that you are for me, I know that you are for me, I know that you will never, for sake in my weakness, and I know that you have come now,
[time=786] here I live to run upon my heart, to remind me, oh I know that you are for me, I know that you are for me, I know that you will never, for sake in my weakness,
[time=814] and I know that you have come now, here I live to run upon my heart, to remind me who you are.
[time=842] So you and me.
[time=848] I know that you are for me, I know that you are for me,
[time=870] I know that you will never, for sake in my weakness, I know that you have come now, here I live to run upon my heart, to remind me who you are.
[time=901] [APPLAUSE]
[time=907] Let me just say a couple things here before Steve comes and teaches us today, first of all, my mind goes back to a summer in 1984, and it was at that time that I was traveling, just, it was a junior in college,
[time=924] traveling with an athletes in action basketball team over in Europe, playing basketball and representing the gospel and doing it with some amazing players, with some incredible coaches, playing at the highest levels over in Europe, we were in France and we were in Switzerland and we were in Belgium,
[time=944] we were in Ireland and we found ourselves toward the end of our trip in Italy, and we were in northern Italy in a place called Trieste, playing the Italian national team and we got a call, the coaches got a call, they told us late one night it was from those across the border in what was then communist Yugoslavia,
[time=964] and we were being invited to come and play the Yugoslavian national team, it wasn't on our schedule, it wasn't part of the trip, they heard we were there, and so we get invited over across the border into Yugoslavia, we got up one morning in Trieste, got on a bus and went to the border,
[time=979] we crossed over and we were immediately met by armed guards, looked like a hundred of them, we knew it was coming, we didn't know what it would entail, but our bus was stopped and it was boarded by armed Yugoslavian national soldiers, they weren't happy, they weren't gracious, they weren't kind, they weren't excited about our presence, they knew who we were, we were taken off the bus, our bags were taken out from underneath, emptied onto the ground,
[time=1006] and we had to go to the bible's which they anticipated they would find were found and confiscated, we were put up against the bus, we were patted down, we were mocked,
[time=1017] it was a little unsettling, we knew we had a game to play so they weren't going to kill us, but it was the first time in my life I ever tasted what it would be like to not be free,
[time=1034] in a powerful way reminded me then and it has reminded me ever since of what an absolute privilege it is to live in a country and to be a part of a nation where I experience and you experience absolute social personal and religious freedom,
[time=1055] a freedom that has been purchased by the blood of as Steve and I looked on our cell phones this morning on Google 1.3 million men and women who have given their lives in our armed forces so that we could be free,
[time=1073] and for that today this weekend we are so very thankful and if you are here this morning up in the balcony down here on the floor if you served in the past or are currently serving, if you have in your family, maybe even one who served and gave his or her life,
[time=1092] if you are connected to this great endeavor in any way we would love for you to stand right now and allow us as a family go ahead and stand and allow us as a family to thank you for your service and to honor those who have fallen in the past.
[time=1113] Thank you. Thank you very, very much. Hey I'm usually sitting down here at this point thinking about what I'm about to do as I get the privilege of teaching and communicating God's Word on Sundays like this I get to also sit down there now and think about why we do this.
[time=1136] It's a wonderful reminder for me why we gather and why we're given to this endeavor of trying to teach the scriptures and help you grow in the process.
[time=1147] I want to just remind you of something Colossians 1, if you've got your Bibles would you turn there.
[time=1151] This is the foundational verse that really is at the crux and at the heart of our ministry here at Blackhawk.
[time=1160] If you ever want to know what we're about, if you ever want to know what's deep in my heart, if you ever want to know what our staff and elders are completely and utterly given to here at Blackhawk.
[time=1172] If you ever want to know what it is that we hope for you as part of this family here it is right here Colossians 1 28 it says this we proclaim him that him is capital H that's Christ we proclaim him.
[time=1188] And in our proclamation of Christ look what it says we admonish every man and teaching we admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom so that we may present every man that's you complete in Christ.
[time=1205] Say that phrase complete in Christ say it complete in Christ Paul said in Philippians 1 6 I'm confident of this very thing that he who began a good work in you will what will perfect or complete it.
[time=1224] And that is exactly what we are given to and we try and do that in a number of different ways we try and do that in children's ministries we try and do that in the Sunday morning gathering we do it in our worship teams we do it in student ministries
[time=1240] we do it in places outside these four walls but my friends our hope and our prayer and our effort is to provide you with a ministry that is able to complete you grow you in your faith.
[time=1255] And this morning as we gather each and every week as we gather it is something that is heavy on our hearts and we want you to know it we want you to sense it.
[time=1265] I know in saying that our desire is to complete you I am in essence saying that you are deficient.
[time=1275] You are aren't you you and me we are deficient we're not who God has called us to be yet there is more growth to be experienced and I cannot wait for us to continue down this road together as we pursue completeness.
[time=1293] I am going to ask Corbin to come and just sing I'm going to just ask him to sing before Steve comes the preaching and the teaching the explaining of God's truth is so important.
[time=1304] And so as he sings I just want to invite you to prepare your hearts as Steve comes this is the final installment of our sent series and I am so looking forward to what you're about to hear the things that God has put on Steve Webster's heart.
[time=1321] If you have been sings and then you'll hear the word.
[time=1326] Speak O Lord as we come to you to receive the full of your holy word.
[time=1343] Make your truth planted deep in us shape and fashion us in your likeness that the light of Christ might be seen today.
[time=1365] In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
[time=1374] Speak O Lord for fill us all your purposes for your glory.
[time=1396] And speak O Lord and renew our minds.
[time=1404] Help us grasp our hearts of your plans for us.
[time=1412] Truth's unchanged from the dawn of time that we'll echo down through eternity.
[time=1427] And by grace we'll stand on your promises and by faith we'll walk as you walk with us.
[time=1444] Speak O Lord till your church is built and the earth is filled with your glory.
[time=1474] May it be so.
[time=1488] Father pray that your word would speak to us this morning and change us.
[time=1495] Shape us, guide us, convict us, encourage us.
[time=1501] There is nothing else that can do all of those things at the same time.
[time=1506] It's not father, the words that are spoken behind this pulpit this morning.
[time=1513] We are fully and totally reliant on your Holy Spirit to do the work he sees fit to do.
[time=1519] And so here we are.
[time=1521] Lord I ask that you be present and active this morning.
[time=1527] Thank you for what you've already done and as our worship continues.
[time=1531] Now around your word I pray that you would indeed speak to us.
[time=1536] Make us ready.
[time=1539] We ask all these things in Jesus name with great thanksgiving.
[time=1544] [AMEN] Good morning everybody.
[time=1548] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=1549] I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1552] Great to teach in the high school in the morning every day where we are limping toward the finish
[time=1558] of school, sprinting toward the finish.
[time=1560] I'm not sure which one it is.
[time=1561] It feels like it kind of goes back and forth day by day.
[time=1564] But it feels like somewhere outside.
[time=1567] So the kids have been there for a couple months already.
[time=1570] They've already been in summer mode.
[time=1572] So we're getting there officially.
[time=1574] Grateful to be with you this morning.
[time=1576] We're going to be in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 today.
[time=1579] There is an outline in your bulletins.
[time=1582] If you want to use that to follow along, I would encourage you that way.
[time=1588] We are indeed winding up our series together on scent.
[time=1594] And really this will serve as the motivation for the guiding principle through all of it.
[time=1601] So we couldn't have done more to leave you with the things that we should leave you with this
[time=1608] morning.
[time=1609] I would ask you if you would please to stand as we read his word this morning.
[time=1613] We'll read the passage together and we'll begin.
[time=1617] 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verses 11 through 21.
[time=1624] Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others.
[time=1629] But what we are is known to God and I hope it is known also to your conscience.
[time=1634] We are not commending ourselves to you again, but giving you cause to boast about us.
[time=1640] That you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what's in the heart.
[time=1646] For if we are beside ourselves, it's for God.
[time=1649] If we are in our right mind, it's for you.
[time=1652] The love of Christ controls us because we have concluded this.
[time=1657] That one has died for all.
[time=1660] Therefore all have died.
[time=1662] And he died for all that those who live might no longer live for themselves.
[time=1666] But for him who for their sake died and was raised.
[time=1671] From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh.
[time=1675] Even though we once were going to Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer.
[time=1679] Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[time=1684] The old has passed away.
[time=1686] Behold, the new has come.
[time=1689] All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.
[time=1698] That is in Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them,
[time=1706] and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.
[time=1710] Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ.
[time=1713] God making his appeal through us, we implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
[time=1722] For our sake, he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
[time=1734] He may be seated.
[time=1737] May God add his blessing to the reading of his word.
[time=1742] This is a quote from Douglas Webster, just coincidence, Douglas Webster.
[time=1750] I thought this was a great introduction to our passage.
[time=1756] The missionary goes out to men of other faiths and of no faith, not to argue, not to make comparisons,
[time=1766] never to claim a superior knowledge or revelation, but to tell of a glorious deed of the new creation
[time=1776] that has occurred and of the new being that has appeared and into which men may enter.
[time=1785] This is testimony, the testimony of the apostles, and this with the energy of love is the missionary motive.
[time=1795] The insistence task of missionary education, the stuff that people go out and teach,
[time=1801] and responsibility is to engender, to pass along this motive throughout the church.
[time=1808] A task that can only be accomplished as men are confronted anew with the message of the Bible
[time=1816] and with its supreme and central story, the story of the cross.
[time=1823] Judea, Samaria, Jerusalem, the ends of the earth.
[time=1828] It isn't just the Czech Republic singing quasi-Jewish songs, although it is that sometimes.
[time=1834] Our team gets back from Kenya tomorrow.
[time=1837] It isn't just Kenya, although it is Kenya.
[time=1840] It's your cul-de-sac.
[time=1842] It's your workplace. It's the barbecue this weekend.
[time=1846] All opportunities for the gospel.
[time=1850] Friends, I cannot tell you how much this passage has confronted me over the last week and a half or so.
[time=1858] It's confronted me with some very powerful truths about what it is that we're doing.
[time=1863] Do you remember last Sunday about those baptisms?
[time=1867] I said to many, many people last week, and maybe you did too.
[time=1870] I had this overwhelming sense that that's what we're about.
[time=1875] This whole place, all of this, all of this is about that and about seeing that happen.
[time=1882] People be reconciled to God.
[time=1886] That is the great blessing that he hasn't just given me.
[time=1890] He's given to each one of us.
[time=1892] It's the plural pronoun that he uses in the passage.
[time=1896] If you have decided to follow Jesus and you have not been baptized, we would love to talk to you about that.
[time=1904] Please don't deprive the people of God of the blessing and the encouragement of just hearing your story
[time=1910] and of proclaiming to the world that very thing.
[time=1913] I had been reconciled with God and here's how he did it.
[time=1917] What a marvelous thing that would be.
[time=1919] Don't deprive the family of God of that and don't yourself neglect that step of obedience.
[time=1924] Be an encouragement to others, to your family, but more than everything, be a testimony.
[time=1929] Bear witness, persuade others by the course of what God is doing in your life.
[time=1935] Look at verse 11 with me in the passage, if you would.
[time=1937] Again, there's an outline in your bulletin.
[time=1940] I was struck with two things in this passage.
[time=1943] And Roman number one in the outline is persuasion.
[time=1947] Paul says in verse 11, "Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others."
[time=1955] Verse 10, which comes before verse 11, you're welcome, talks about the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=1963] And then the first word in verse 11 is therefore.
[time=1967] So, because I know that Christ will return and he will judge the world, there's fear.
[time=1974] The fear of the Lord.
[time=1976] Francis Chan, I just got then teaching a grove group on one of Francis Chan's books, Erasing Hell.
[time=1981] It was a great time. I would encourage you to pick up the book if you have any opportunity to do so.
[time=1987] Francis Chan also did a video series called Basic in Recent Years where he basically is laying out some fundamental truths for the church and how the church operates.
[time=1997] And this is the first volume in the series, Fear God.
[time=2002] There are other volumes in the series about the Holy Spirit, about the fellowship of the church in general.
[time=2008] But the first one he chose was Fear God.
[time=2011] And the whole 10 minute video is about how we have lost the truth, this biblical truth, of fearing God.
[time=2020] Is it a healthy respect? Yes. But it's more than that.
[time=2025] The judgment that Christ will come and he will visit upon mankind motivated Paul in his witness.
[time=2032] In Chan's book Erasing Hell, he says that it's very, very hard to convince people to be moral, to be good without the reality of hell, which the Bible makes very, very clear.
[time=2043] And which Christ talks about in verse 10, I'm going to come to judge the world and I'll separate sheep and goats.
[time=2049] It isn't sheep and goats and dogs and cats and platypuses and giraffes.
[time=2053] There's two tribes, if you will, those who are in and those who are outside.
[time=2059] The fear of the Lord motivates persuasion.
[time=2063] Persuasion, to persuade in that verse, verse 11, means to inspire men, watch this, to inspire men with words to believe.
[time=2075] With words, Francis of Assisi gets often gets quoted saying preach the gospel, use words if necessary.
[time=2083] I'm not sure what that means exactly.
[time=2086] Lifestyle of angelism is to be celebrated, to be sure, but there is no response.
[time=2091] Romans 10 makes it very clear that words are always necessary.
[time=2096] How do you hear without a preacher?
[time=2098] If they don't hear the word, they won't respond and so on it goes.
[time=2102] We persuade others what we are, verse 11, Paul says is known to God.
[time=2111] I'm going to, this is another profound truth I'll share with you this morning.
[time=2116] Jesus is greater than Santa Claus.
[time=2121] Just give you a second to drink that in, okay?
[time=2124] He sees you when you're sleeping, he knows when you're awake, he knows, you know the song, right?
[time=2131] Jesus goes one better and says he knows why I do what I do.
[time=2137] Paul is in the middle here of defending his role as an apostle because he was under attack.
[time=2142] And so Paul says my motivation is known to God.
[time=2146] He knows why I'm doing what I'm doing.
[time=2147] I have to prove myself to you.
[time=2150] He's just getting left and right, left and right, and the Corinthians are struggling like I, Paul preach the gospel.
[time=2155] I want to believe it.
[time=2156] The Catholic essay is a liar.
[time=2157] I'm not sure what's going on.
[time=2160] Christ knows why you do what you do.
[time=2164] If it's for outward appearance as this passage was on to say, or if it's from the heart.
[time=2169] So he weighs even those motives that you have day by day by day.
[time=2174] And I'm grateful that he knows, need that intimately.
[time=2178] And you can take your cares and your request to him friends for that very reason.
[time=2184] Persuasion.
[time=2186] Persuasion was so important to people living in Paul's day that they worshiped the art of persuasion of rhetoric as a goddess.
[time=2193] They valued words that much.
[time=2196] And here comes Paul into Corinth.
[time=2198] Corinth is a very cosmopolitan place, very beautiful, very exalted, very educated.
[time=2203] And these people, gifted in rhetoric, could get up in the town square and they would preach.
[time=2206] They'd be very good looking and very put together and very smooth.
[time=2210] And by all accounts, Paul is not any of those things.
[time=2213] He's not smooth.
[time=2214] He's not good looking.
[time=2215] He was a little bald headed, you know, Jew.
[time=2219] Here comes walking into town and he gives all this exalted message.
[time=2223] And people just say, who is this guy?
[time=2225] That's 1 Corinthians chapter 1 in the community this week if you want to.
[time=2228] We persuade others.
[time=2230] Like, who are you, Paul?
[time=2232] Look at you.
[time=2233] You're this tall and everybody else is this tall and you have a squeaky little voice and you're not smooth at all.
[time=2240] Why should I trust you?
[time=2241] All of these things.
[time=2243] In Acts 18, Paul tries to persuade Jews and Greeks.
[time=2248] This is his message.
[time=2250] This is what he's after.
[time=2251] All the time.
[time=2253] Look at verse 12.
[time=2254] We are not commending ourselves to you again, but giving you cause to boast about us.
[time=2259] You may be able to answer those who boast about, here it is, outward appearance and not about what's in the heart.
[time=2264] That phrase there in verse 12, cause to boast is a military term appropriate on Memorial Day.
[time=2270] It's a military term that people would use to, it was a word that would use for a base of operations.
[time=2276] Like the place that you would launch an attack from.
[time=2278] It was a safe, secure place.
[time=2281] My uncle, Dan, has been over to the Middle East several times in the last 10 years.
[time=2286] He repairs airplanes.
[time=2287] He's been pretty busy.
[time=2288] But the places that he goes are far, far away from the front lines because there are places where they're like 10,000 Marines at his base.
[time=2296] He flies in, picks up the planes, he flies back out.
[time=2298] Cause you gotta have a safe place to fix the planes.
[time=2300] That's the place we're talking about.
[time=2302] Very far away from the fray.
[time=2304] A place from which attacks our launch that is itself a safe place.
[time=2310] What's the point?
[time=2312] Kelly and I have a responsibility before you to live our lives in such a way that the gospel message that we proclaim
[time=2321] and that the ministry of this place is never under threat.
[time=2325] And you can go out and confidently proclaim the good news because you can trust that during the week, here,
[time=2332] we're after it in a way that you had never any reason to be ashamed about.
[time=2336] To conduct every one of our affairs, forthrightly before you, to be honest with you when you ask us questions and to tell you the truth about what God's word says.
[time=2344] That's what it means to cause to boast.
[time=2346] I need to live my life in such a way that you never have reason to be ashamed of the gospel because of me or because of what Kelly does or anybody else for that matter.
[time=2354] That's what that verse is about and Paul is in the middle of that.
[time=2357] Verse 13, if we are beside ourselves, it's for God.
[time=2363] If we are in our right mind, it's for you.
[time=2365] There's a lot going on there in verse 13.
[time=2367] Let's leave it to say this, okay?
[time=2370] Paul believes that the need for other people to be persuaded and to be confronted with the gospel is more important
[time=2377] than his private spiritual experiences with God.
[time=2381] Paul has other people's needs as more important than his own.
[time=2385] And what a model he is.
[time=2387] So Paul goes on and on in his letters, guys, saying, "Follow my example.
[time=2390] Do the things that I have done." Can you say that?
[time=2395] We should each make it our aim, friends, day by day, to make it easy for other people to follow our example.
[time=2402] And if we can't do that, then in some way our witness is going to be compromised.
[time=2406] Do as I've done.
[time=2408] Think about things in this way, much more to say here in verse 14.
[time=2412] Look at verse 14, now we get into the actual content of the things that we are to persuade others about.
[time=2417] Listen to this, this is amazing.
[time=2420] For the love of Christ controls us.
[time=2423] That's the first thing that we are to guide our persuasion.
[time=2426] Letter A is the love of Christ and what love it was.
[time=2431] Much more to come on that.
[time=2433] The love of Christ, it says there, guys, it controls us.
[time=2436] And that word controls by read compels in your translation.
[time=2441] That was a word that would be used of a straight, of a place, of a very narrow place between two larger land masses where boats would pass.
[time=2449] So the ships were guided, right?
[time=2452] They were guided to this narrow place.
[time=2454] The love of Christ controls, guides, directs us.
[time=2459] Notice, friends, it isn't my love for Christ that controls or compels.
[time=2465] It is his love that controls and compels.
[time=2469] He will never ask you to go somewhere or to do something and then leave you hanging once you get out there.
[time=2475] Go there.
[time=2476] Do this.
[time=2477] And I'll be with you always to the end of the age.
[time=2479] That's a promise that he makes.
[time=2482] That his compelling guiding, the path that you're taking in your life is directed by his love.
[time=2487] And what great strength does that give you to know that God loves you?
[time=2491] Does that give you strength to know that God you are loved by him and the greatest demonstration of love you've ever had is the cross?
[time=2498] Does that encourage any of you?
[time=2500] Okay.
[time=2502] The love of Christ controls, compels.
[time=2505] It's compelling.
[time=2506] People need to hear this story.
[time=2509] God loves you so much he sent his son to die in your place.
[time=2517] I have his son.
[time=2522] And I don't love anyone that much.
[time=2526] I don't think I do anyway.
[time=2528] It's very honest.
[time=2531] Here's my son so you can be free.
[time=2534] If you ever doubt that he loves you, stop.
[time=2536] Stop today.
[time=2538] This is the gospel.
[time=2539] This is the beautiful, glorious, transcendent truth of the gospel, dear friends.
[time=2546] The love of Christ controls us.
[time=2548] Look at verse 15.
[time=2551] He died for all.
[time=2554] It says there.
[time=2555] He died for all.
[time=2556] That those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.
[time=2563] Verse 14 says there at the end, the NLT says there.
[time=2567] We have all died to our old way of life and I would simply ask you if you have.
[time=2572] Have you died to your old way of life or is there really no discernible difference between what you said was before and what you said was after?
[time=2579] I love that about baptism because it makes it very plain.
[time=2582] I was lost and I'm found.
[time=2584] I was blind and now I see.
[time=2586] That's the point of baptism in some ways.
[time=2591] What a beautiful verse this is.
[time=2596] We had some good talks with our daughter in the last week about what it means to be saved.
[time=2601] Because one of our friends in our class got baptized last week and so we talked about a physoli about what do you think about that, Hannah?
[time=2609] Well, all those things.
[time=2610] It was a good thing.
[time=2611] We're very wary.
[time=2612] Jody and I are very wary of Hannah making decisions about Christ.
[time=2616] Please us.
[time=2617] It's hard in this position because she wants to please.
[time=2622] It's a good thing.
[time=2623] But we don't want ever to, for her to feel forced to making a decision for Christ in the wrong way.
[time=2628] Look at verse 14 again before I get ahead of myself here.
[time=2633] Love of Christ's control is because we have concluded this.
[time=2637] To conclude means you make a decision to take all the factors into consideration.
[time=2642] Before you decide to follow Jesus, take all the factors into consideration, walking with your eyes wide open.
[time=2649] If you think that you can mouth a few words as a child and live life totally wayward and sinfully,
[time=2656] and the God is somehow strong armed to overlook your sin because you mouth some words.
[time=2660] That's not true.
[time=2661] It's not the gospel.
[time=2662] It's not 2 Corinthians 5.
[time=2665] We have concluded this friends.
[time=2667] Faith in Christ Jesus or faith in Christ, faith in Jesus.
[time=2671] Rabbi Zechariah said is a cognitive, passionate, moral choice.
[time=2677] That's where we stand before him.
[time=2679] That's what it means to have faith in Christ.
[time=2681] Okay, verse 15.
[time=2683] He died for all that those who live by no longer live for themselves, but for him who for their sake died and was raised.
[time=2690] Let her be in your outline.
[time=2691] So the first thing we persuade those is with the love of Christ as evidence let her be by the death of Christ.
[time=2698] And then let her see having persuaded them in that way, we encourage them to live for Christ.
[time=2707] The love of Christ, the death of Christ, and then to live for Christ.
[time=2710] Friends, I will say this as gently as I can.
[time=2716] As of yesterday, children's ministry still needs 65 people to volunteer in Sunday morning.
[time=2722] 65 people.
[time=2725] I am told that 10 people sign up after the first service, so we're down to 55.
[time=2733] This should not be friends.
[time=2738] Live so that other people and their children may benefit.
[time=2744] From what goes on in this room, it goes on in every room in this place.
[time=2747] I can tell you very straightforwardly, as soon as I'm standing here right now, that we all work hard to make sure that everything that goes on in this place gives him much glory, including what's going on right now.
[time=2758] We've worked hard on it, and Janice and her people work very, very hard and they need your help.
[time=2763] And I think that's appropriate for me to say to you.
[time=2767] Live so that others may benefit.
[time=2769] That's a good chance to do it.
[time=2770] They still need 55 people to do it.
[time=2772] There's a booth right outside that door waiting for you to help out.
[time=2775] They need lots and lots of help.
[time=2777] Would you please consider that the summer?
[time=2779] It's every other week, just for the summer.
[time=2780] I know that you're busy.
[time=2782] I know you'll be traveling.
[time=2783] I know you have responsibilities.
[time=2785] I very firmly believe that if you are willing to help, they'll find a place where you can't help.
[time=2790] Many of you have been ministering to my children over the years and I'm grateful for you.
[time=2795] Please be a blessing to others in that way.
[time=2797] Live so that others may benefit.
[time=2800] To sacrifice worth making.
[time=2802] Verse 16, as the passage concludes, is about perspective.
[time=2806] By having the right perspective.
[time=2808] That's letter 2, I should say.
[time=2810] That letter 2.
[time=2813] Number 2 on the outline.
[time=2815] Perspective.
[time=2818] The right point of view about Christ and what he has done.
[time=2822] Verse 17 says, "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation." It doesn't say like a new creation.
[time=2828] It says, "They are a new creation." I'll say it again.
[time=2833] If anyone is in Christ, it doesn't say that they're like a new creation because they are a new creation.
[time=2838] If you are in Christ, you are a new creation.
[time=2841] And the Holy Spirit, Ephesians 1, has taken up residence in your heart as a proof, as a guarantee that you are his child.
[time=2850] And because he lives in there, guess what?
[time=2853] Love.
[time=2854] Joy.
[time=2855] Peace.
[time=2856] Patience.
[time=2857] Kindness.
[time=2858] Goodness.
[time=2859] Gentleness.
[time=2860] Faithfulness.
[time=2861] Self-control.
[time=2862] The outcome is spilling out of you all the time.
[time=2864] And that's attractive.
[time=2866] That's appealing to people.
[time=2868] Why does he love his wife like that?
[time=2870] How can he be joyful in this tough work situation?
[time=2873] How can you have peace when everything around you is going crazy?
[time=2876] Let's talk about that.
[time=2878] You will have chances to do it.
[time=2881] David prayed that the Holy Spirit, that his salvation would be renewed and the Spirit would renew a right place within him.
[time=2890] Pray that today.
[time=2892] If you are in Christ, those things are true of you whether you think they are or not.
[time=2896] It doesn't matter what you think about it.
[time=2898] They're true.
[time=2899] Speak, oh Lord, the lyrics to that song spoke of that.
[time=2903] Change our minds.
[time=2905] Renew our minds with your truth.
[time=2909] Christ has done this.
[time=2911] Verse 16 says, "We regard no one according to the flesh." It says that in verse 16.
[time=2917] I got this from one of my students, Facebook pages this week.
[time=2920] How great is that?
[time=2921] This quote, I'm about to read you.
[time=2922] I got from one of my students, Facebook pages.
[time=2925] Win.
[time=2926] I have no greater joy than to see my students use their Facebook wisely.
[time=2932] Something like that.
[time=2934] We stand in awe of the ocean, the thunderstorm.
[time=2938] God, we could use some rain.
[time=2940] The sunset.
[time=2941] The mountains.
[time=2942] But we pass by a human being without notice even though the person is God's most magnificent creation.
[time=2951] We regard no one according to the flesh.
[time=2954] C.S. Lewis said in the weight of glory, write it down.
[time=2956] It's the greatest book I've ever read about heaven.
[time=2958] It's called The Weight, W-E-I-G-H-T, The Weight of Glory.
[time=2963] He said, "You have never met a mere mortal."
[time=2969] There are no ordinary people.
[time=2971] Nations, cultures, arts, civilization.
[time=2974] These are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat.
[time=2979] But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit.
[time=2986] Immortal horrors or everlasting splendors.
[time=2991] Everybody you meet at the bank, at the grocery store, on the street, in the lobby out there,
[time=2999] is immortal.
[time=3001] We'll live forever, and it's worth your time.
[time=3005] That's a takeaway.
[time=3006] Everyone's worth your time.
[time=3007] Write it down.
[time=3008] Everyone is worth your time.
[time=3010] But they're annoying, Steve.
[time=3011] I know.
[time=3012] So are you.
[time=3013] (Laughter) And someone else thought it worthy of her time.
[time=3017] Where's Rick Raber?
[time=3018] Rick, go see Rick after the service and ask him to tell you a story about what happened in his class this morning.
[time=3025] And the story of the ministry of reconciliation that happened in the lives of the people that were in his class.
[time=3031] I can't wait for you to talk to him.
[time=3033] If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[time=3037] That's our perspective about us, too.
[time=3040] Let her be on your outline.
[time=3042] My point of view about Christ, my point of view about ourselves, about me.
[time=3047] And if I am in Christ, I am a new creation because of what he's done.
[time=3050] And these verses go on to say these incredible things.
[time=3055] Look at verses 18 and 19.
[time=3059] All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us plural.
[time=3066] Not me alone, us, the ministry of reconciliation.
[time=3071] That is, in Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses
[time=3079] against them.
[time=3081] And entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.
[time=3086] All this is from God.
[time=3090] This is his idea.
[time=3092] We are a part of his story.
[time=3095] We have been grafted into this marvelous, surpassingly wonderful story.
[time=3100] But it gets even better.
[time=3102] Look at verse 20.
[time=3103] "Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us.
[time=3107] We implore you.
[time=3109] We beg you on behalf of Christ.
[time=3111] Be reconciled to God.
[time=3113] Begu, implore is not a, it's a very urgent word.
[time=3118] It isn't a, if you get around to it kind of a word.
[time=3121] It isn't a, if you have time kind of a word, it's, I implore you.
[time=3124] I beg you to the real force there.
[time=3126] For our sake, here it is.
[time=3128] Verse 21.
[time=3130] God made this verse just strike us today.
[time=3133] Look at what it says.
[time=3134] "For our sake, he made him to be sin who knew no sin.
[time=3142] That in him we might become the righteousness of God."
[time=3150] That's unbelievable.
[time=3154] Through the lens of Scripture friends, we get a right perspective on Christ and his work begun in us.
[time=3161] We get a right point of view on ourselves and what we are to do.
[time=3165] And we get a right point of view about other people and their need for reconciliation and their need to hear what we have been given to say.
[time=3175] The perfect, spotless, sinless son of God.
[time=3180] Colossians 1 calls him the firstborn of all creation.
[time=3183] Hebrews 1 calls him the, the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his nature.
[time=3190] God made Jesus to be sin that this wretched person could become the righteousness of God.
[time=3197] That's unbelievable.
[time=3200] In the best sense, it's extraordinary.
[time=3203] Isn't that extraordinary?
[time=3205] That's a message worth telling to people that you come into contact with today, to your waitress.
[time=3212] Maybe she's having a bad day, your waitress, and your icing doesn't get filled up quite fast enough.
[time=3218] I'll show her.
[time=3220] What?
[time=3222] No, God made Christ to become sin who knew no sin.
[time=3227] You can deal with your waitress.
[time=3229] Preach the gospel with dollars.
[time=3232] Leave her a tip that demonstrates grace.
[time=3236] Maybe just ask you about how you're doing.
[time=3238] Maybe your prayer before the meal won't be a stumbling block for her.
[time=3242] Sorry.
[time=3246] Friends, listen, we have been given the ministry of reconciliation and it's good news.
[time=3253] It's a story worth telling.
[time=3255] Friends work hard, work hard to gain the currency with people around you so you can tell them the story.
[time=3261] Then it won't be awkward.
[time=3263] It will be awkward sometimes because the Holy Spirit does that with people.
[time=3267] He makes them feel awkward and convicted of their sin.
[time=3269] That's not very pleasant for people, so they don't react very well.
[time=3273] But work hard to get the currency to tell them what he's doing in your life.
[time=3277] Do you have a story worth telling?
[time=3279] Is my next question.
[time=3282] Are you living, he's making his appeal through you and through me, so be appealing.
[time=3287] Are you appealing or are you a jerk?
[time=3291] If you're a jerk, then you won't have the credibility to tell the story.
[time=3295] Work hard to tell the story and be humble about it.
[time=3301] So we persuade others with the love of Christ, which is demonstrated by his death and which encourages us then to live for him and not for ourselves.
[time=3311] And we have a right point of view about Jesus, about ourselves and about other people.
[time=3315] He has made us a new creation.
[time=3318] He has given us the ministry of reconciliation.
[time=3320] We can tell our friends, our neighbors, our family members, that God is not counting your sins against you.
[time=3327] That's what trespass is.
[time=3328] There is the line.
[time=3329] Let me go like this, right over it.
[time=3332] God's not counting it against you.
[time=3335] I have a long list of trespasses, friends, and so do you.
[time=3340] And he has forgiven them.
[time=3342] You have died to your old way of life if you are in Christ and if you are all things have passed away, those old things and all things have become new.
[time=3352] You don't need to come down forward and praise me this morning if you've never been reconciled to God.
[time=3356] You can do that right where you are and you and him with fellowship.
[time=3359] If you want to talk to me about it though, I can't tell you how happy that would make me.
[time=3363] There will be others down here that would love to talk with you about being reconciled to God.
[time=3368] As a secondary thing I would say this, I would just repeat my emphasis with regard to your ministry with the kids at this church.
[time=3376] Please, please consider going right out that door.
[time=3378] This one right there that I'm pointing at right there.
[time=3381] And being a blessing to those people who are serving so faithfully, let me also say this.
[time=3387] If you feel as though there are relationships in your life that there's too much to overcome, too much baggage, too much water under the bridge, I offer up to you 2 Corinthians 5-21.
[time=3397] He made him to be sin who knew no sin that we could be called Christ's righteousness.
[time=3403] God's righteousness.
[time=3404] There is no barrier that can't be overcome.
[time=3410] But be reconciled to God first, then be reconciled to your neighbor.
[time=3413] Would you all stand with me and we'll pray and be dismissed this morning?
[time=3416] This is our ministry, friends.
[time=3418] It's not just mine.
[time=3419] It's ours together.
[time=3422] And I am delighted for the encouragement of God's Word to go out and to be reconciliation
[time=3432] ministers.
[time=3433] God, thank you for today and for my dear friends in this room.
[time=3436] I am overwhelmed at the surpassingly beautiful exchange that the sinless, spotless Son of
[time=3442] God became sin that this wretched man could be the righteousness of God.
[time=3449] God has a story worth telling.
[time=3452] God, it's compelling.
[time=3454] It's appealing.
[time=3456] You are making your appeal through us.
[time=3461] You have called us your ambassadors.
[time=3466] And oh, Father, may it be so today.
[time=3468] Give us opportunities to speak this truth.
[time=3471] If there is anybody using the sound of my voice that has not been reconciled to you, if they confess with their mouth and believe in their heart that you raised Jesus from the dead, they will be saved.
[time=3481] May it be so today.
[time=3482] I ask all these things, trusting you to give us the power to do what you've told us to do in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3517] [MUSIC]
