[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It's great to be with you again.
[time=35] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege and it is that an absolute privilege to be a part of the Black Hawk Ministries team and we have the honor week after week to do our very best to bring you the life-changing eternity-altering message of God's word.

[time=61] Our hope is that it's making a difference in your life.
[time=64] Over these next several weeks, beginning this Sunday at Black Hawk, we start a teaching series that we've entitled Untouchable and the untouchables are issues that sometimes, the church, I think because of fear or because of uncertainty or a lack of clarity in their hearts and minds, a lot of times the church stays away from these issues and we've just decided to, with the word of God at the forefront of our study, we've decided to delve into these issues and so over these next several weeks, we're gonna be touching on, teaching on and giving us a chance to interact with regards to homosexuality, politics, justice issues, justice issues like homelessness and poverty and AIDS and things of that nature.
[time=115] Singleness and purity and a lot of things that I think we desperately need to understand, things that we need to have a voice in, issues that today, the older ones of us and the younger ones of us, we need a roadmap, we need to know how to navigate these issues in a way that brings honor to God.
[time=137] We need to know how to speak the truth about these issues but also we need to know how to do that in love like the word of God tells us to.
[time=145] So join us, come and be with us on Sunday mornings at nine or 1045.

[time=202] [MUSIC - 727 seconds]
[time=939] â™ª Our Lord lived a perfect holy life, and like the song says, he wasn't guilty of sin, but he suffered as if he was. Corinthians says that God made him who knew no sin to become sin on our behalf. Christ died that cruel death, and in the process, through resurrection power.
[time=963] God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name.
[time=970] When we sing about all authority is yours, it's because God has given that authority to his son, Jesus.
[time=978] And he has the power to overcome death and the grave.
[time=983] There's nothing harder to overcome in the universe.
[time=987] Jesus overcame the hardest thing.
[time=991] There was a phrase in the song in the middle of the choir saying several times, "We will overcome." He extends that to us too. We get to overcome death and the grave because he did first.
[time=1004] And the song says, "We will overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony."
[time=1011] So it's the power of Jesus' blood that lets us be overcomers, and it's us saying, "Yes, I believe in the Lord."
[time=1020] And he is my Savior and King and God that gives us this overcoming power.
[time=1026] And that's a direct quote from Scripture, and I just want to read it to you and let you think about it a little bit this morning.
[time=1033] In Revelation chapter 12, it talks about this overcoming by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony.
[time=1040] And the context is this battle raging in heaven between Satan and the heavenly armies.
[time=1046] And the heavenly armies win, by the way. It's beautiful. You should read Revelation 12 sometime.
[time=1052] And Revelation 12, 10 through 11, talks about this key phrase, blood of the Lamb, word of our testimony.
[time=1058] It says this, "And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, 'Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ have come.'"
[time=1069] For the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God.
[time=1079] And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives, even unto death.
[time=1089] So there's that phrase we were singing about, the blood of the Lamb, the word of our testimony.
[time=1094] And it says that they, Jesus in his army, ended up conquering him, Satan in his army, through that powerful blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony.
[time=1103] What's the word of their testimony? It's the next phrase.
[time=1106] They loved not their lives, even unto death. And so it's a picture of the martyrs. It's a picture of the saints who have been faced with the choice.
[time=1116] They've pronounced the Lord or die, and they said, "My God's better than life. I won't renounce him."
[time=1124] And they loved not their lives, even unto death. And that's a powerful testimony that speaks into our world and it speaks into the whole universe and it speaks into the principalities and powers of darkness.
[time=1138] And they are overcome with the fact that people would love not their lives, even unto death.
[time=1144] When the blood of the Lamb comes in, cleanses and changes us. It makes us see God as the most treasured possession in all of the universe, even to the point of loving not our lives, even unto death.
[time=1158] This morning, perhaps you feel like you have an obstacle that needs to be overcome, probably less cosmic than this amazing obstacle of Satan and his minions.
[time=1170] But nevertheless, we face immediate challenges in our lives where we feel like they need to be overcome, and I would challenge you to overcome them by the blood of the Lamb.
[time=1180] And the word of your testimony that God's love is better than life, that serving him is better than anything else.
[time=1189] Worshiping him is the best thing that you can do with your songs, yeah, but more importantly with your life and with your priorities and your choices.
[time=1199] So we're going to sing another song here together that just reminds us that God through Christ is this amazing overcomer.
[time=1207] And he's going to do it ultimately in this cosmic sense, but he'll do it immediately in whatever circumstance that you feel like here in the midst of that just can't be overcome.
[time=1216] When we say God, you are better than life itself, and you are worthy to be praised.
[time=1221] So let's stand and sing of this overcoming power exhibited in Christ together.
[time=1229] Christ is risen from the dead, trampling over death by death.
[time=1235] Come awake, come awake, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=1241] Christ is risen from the dead, we are with him again.
[time=1247] Come awake, come awake, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=1258] Rise up from the grave.
[time=1264] Beneath the great of all our sin, you have to not but heaven's will.
[time=1276] You're scheme of hell, those coffers crown, no burden, great can hold you down the strain.
[time=1290] You will reign forever like your church proclaim.
[time=1299] Christ is risen from the dead, trampling over death by death.
[time=1305] Come awake, come awake, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=1311] Christ is risen from the dead, we are with him again.
[time=1317] Come awake, come awake, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=1331] Hell, where is your victory, oh church?
[time=1338] Come stand in the light, the glory of God has to be in the night.
[time=1346] Come back, come back, come back, come back, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=1360] Come back, come back, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=1368] Jesus Christ is risen from the dead, trampling over death by death.
[time=1375] Come awake, come awake, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=1381] Christ is risen from the dead, we are with him again.
[time=1387] Come awake, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=1394] Christ is risen from the dead, trampling over death by death.
[time=1399] Come awake, come awake, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=1405] Christ is risen from the dead, we are with him again.
[time=1411] Come awake, come awake, come and rise up from the grave.
[time=1424] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul, worship His only name.
[time=1443] Sing like never before, sing like never before, oh my soul.
[time=1453] I worship Your only name.
[time=1475] About 17 years ago, over in Barrington, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, Bill Hibles and the staff
[time=1486] at Willow Creek Community Church and the Willow Creek Association started what was then known and still is known as the Leadership Summit.
[time=1493] The idea behind the Leadership Summit was and still is to encourage and equip and train
[time=1500] and inspire those who are in leadership in the church and that doesn't just mean pastors,
[time=1507] that means the church, that means anybody who names the name of Christ and has been put
[time=1513] in any situation where you have the opportunity to influence others.
[time=1518] That means you and it has always been in their heart from the day they started 17 years ago
[time=1525] to inspire and encourage and teach and equip the church and those who lead it.
[time=1531] They also, over the years, have found a great avenue of influence into the marketplace and business
[time=1537] and other organizations come from all over to take part and to benefit from the teaching
[time=1543] and what takes place in the summit.
[time=1545] And about 10 years ago, they started doing satellite sites because there was no more room
[time=1551] over in Barrington at the church there that seats 10,000 people.
[time=1556] They were out of room and so they started doing satellite sites all over the country and now there's hundreds of satellite sites.
[time=1564] We're one of them and every August we gather in this room for two days, this year it's August 9 and 10,
[time=1571] to just put on our learning hats and sit together and be encouraged and equipped and inspired
[time=1578] to lead in a more effective way in whatever circumstance God has put you in.
[time=1585] And so last year at the summit, Dr. Henry Cloud, who I've had the privilege of getting to know over these last few years through my association and friendship with the team over at Willow, Dr. Cloud, brought this message to the summit last August and you're going to hear it this morning.
[time=1602] And I want you to hear it because it's full of truth.
[time=1605] I also want you to hear it because it's a message that I believe will encourage you in the everyday of your life.
[time=1611] Again, the summit is for everybody.
[time=1614] And this is just a taste.
[time=1616] This is just an example of what you'll get when you sign up this morning, which you're all going
[time=1622] to do, surprise.
[time=1624] This is just a taste of what you're going to get.
[time=1627] And I just hope that you'll sit this morning and I hope you'll just take it in.
[time=1630] I've watched this message time and time again.
[time=1634] I'll probably just intentionally watch it three or four times a year.
[time=1638] It's something that is important for us to understand.
[time=1642] The title of it is Wise Foolish and Evil People.
[time=1645] And here's the idea.
[time=1646] The basic premise is that you and I have to deal with people in our lives.
[time=1652] If we're going to do what God has called us to do, we're inevitably going to have to deal with people.
[time=1659] That may be family.
[time=1661] That might be marriage.
[time=1663] It could be business.
[time=1664] It could be ministry teams.
[time=1666] It could be a number of settings.
[time=1668] But for you and I to faithfully do what God has called us to do, we're going to have to deal with people.
[time=1674] And there are all kinds of people.
[time=1676] He'll explain it much better than I will.
[time=1678] But just please take it in.
[time=1680] Be so thankful that we get to hear this and see this.
[time=1683] Here it is, Dr. Henry Cloud, Wise Foolish and Evil People.
[time=1687] In my work, which is mostly spent with CEOs and executive teams talking about
[time=1698] all the things of leadership and always going to thinking, this is great.
[time=1702] We're going to talk about vision casting and being a change agent, aligning behaviors and cultures and all this sort of stuff.
[time=1707] And I swear it happens every time.
[time=1710] It is just not that long into the conversation before the topic turns to that guy.
[time=1720] I've got this guy.
[time=1724] Or this woman.
[time=1725] I don't know what to do with the CEO or the leader will say.
[time=1730] Now, so what's the deal?
[time=1732] And we'll go into a process that they think, and innocently so is so unique, that they've
[time=1739] got this person.
[time=1740] And these are people that lead sometimes very significant things.
[time=1744] CEOs of big public companies, tens of billions of revenues and tens of thousands of people,
[time=1752] a lot of experience.
[time=1753] And all the way down to smaller firms and churches, leaders with experience.
[time=1760] But they think it's unique, but it's not.
[time=1763] And once you understand that this guy that they're having problems with is not that unique and you've got the formula, I promise you.
[time=1771] And you'll get your five cents back if this isn't true.
[time=1776] If you can implement what we talk about here today, you can literally save years of time.
[time=1781] But more than that, I'm going to start with kind of the end in mind here.
[time=1785] More than that is this.
[time=1787] Wherever you are, God has called you to be a steward over a vision.
[time=1794] A steward over a vision for the specific reason of changing something in a community or a
[time=1801] world or a family or a nation.
[time=1806] And here's the big leadership question for this moment.
[time=1810] Are you going to allow this guy to stop your vision?
[time=1816] Or this woman that may report to you or be on a team or somewhere and the topic today is,
[time=1822] what do you do with that kind of person that maybe as we will see, very, very gifted,
[time=1829] maybe the smartest cookie at the table, may get great results, but there's some issue
[time=1835] that is not changing with them that robs you of your joy, keeps you up at night,
[time=1842] and also sometimes has the power to stop an entire organization, to stop an entire mission through either non-performance or their divisiveness or
[time=1853] just what they infect the system with or whatever the issue is.
[time=1859] So in this session we're going to talk about a simple tool to begin to figure this out.
[time=1864] Now I'm going to give you the orienting question and basically we can find a lot of words for this, but it's this.
[time=1872] What does a person do when the truth comes to them?
[time=1879] That's the diagnostic question as you evaluate your people.
[time=1884] What does a person do when reality comes to them?
[time=1889] All systems of leadership will tell you that one of the biggest first tasks of the leader is to figure out what reality is.
[time=1897] And then to make that reality engageable and workable within what you're leading, but what do you do if you've got people that you're trying to give reality to, and they're allergic to that reality?
[time=1910] That's our question for today.
[time=1913] Now I'm not going to act like feedback's easy to receive.
[time=1916] How many of you just love to get feedback?
[time=1919] I mean sometimes it's hard.
[time=1921] I've been on the road a lot and I was getting fat again.
[time=1925] I lose my routine.
[time=1927] I lose my structure.
[time=1929] And so I read one of my stupid books and it drives me crazy.
[time=1934] I see the same principle all the way through where your maturity is not strong enough to do something at external structure.
[time=1941] I go, "Okay, so I hire a trainer." I go, "All right, I'm not getting this done on my own, so I get a trainer." So I go to the gym, hire this woman, and she is tough.
[time=1952] And she's working on me, but I'm actually kind of proud of myself because I am doing, I'm doing all the workouts.
[time=1958] She's beating me up every day and I'm in there and it's all going well.
[time=1962] And I've been in it for a little while at this point.
[time=1965] And one morning she's just beating me to death and it dawned on me and I looked up and I said, "Oh no." I stopped and she said, "What?" I said, "We forgot to take the before pictures."
[time=1984] This is an awful waste.
[time=1987] She looks at me and she says, "Oh, we still can."
[time=1997] Feedback is not that easy to hear sometimes.
[time=2003] It is what it is, but sometimes our feedback is not that great either.
[time=2008] I remember one time when I was in graduate school I had two German shepherds and I lived in a small duplex and the houses were close and I was watching TV one afternoon, a golf tournament.
[time=2017] There was a knock at the door.
[time=2019] I go outside and there's a police officer at my door.
[time=2022] And I said, "Yes." And he said, "Well, I got to talk to you, we got a complaint." I said, "What's the complaint?" He says, "Cruelty to animals." I said, "Cruelty to animals." He said, "Yeah, you have two large dogs." And I said, "Yeah." He said, "Well, we got a complaint.
[time=2038] You're cruel to them." I said, "These are the most pampered dogs in Southern California." I mean, I take them out to lunch, at restaurants, I travel, I put them in the dog hotel, they got cable.
[time=2048] I mean, come on.
[time=2051] He says, "Well, it's what it says here." And I said, "Well, specifically, what does it say?" And he says, "Well, you don't feed your dogs and you don't scoop their poop."
[time=2061] I said, "Offster?" [ Laughter ] You're going to have to pick one of those.
[time=2071] [ Laughter ]
[time=2077] He's looking at this.
[time=2078] I said, "If I ain't feeding them, there ain't no poop." [ Laughter ] I said, "It's kind of stupid, isn't it?" [ Laughter ] Okay, so some feedback.
[time=2089] It's our fault.
[time=2091] But I'm going to assume for this session that you're giving good feedback.
[time=2094] There's all sorts of guides on that.
[time=2096] In necessary innings, I've got a guide on that.
[time=2098] You can find stuff out there.
[time=2100] I'm going to assume you're good at it.
[time=2102] But here's the problem.
[time=2103] You make an assumption as a leader as well.
[time=2107] And I know you do, because I've worked with you.
[time=2109] And here's the problem.
[time=2110] You are probably, at this level of leadership, you're kind and you're responsible.
[time=2114] And when you're a kind person, a responsible person, what happens when somebody comes and gives you feedback?
[time=2121] And they show, "You know that report you wrote or that talk you gave or that meeting you led?" You know, it kind of was not so, "Here you ought to change this." And what you probably do, which is why you got to where you are today, is you listen and you go, "Oh, really, tell me, how?" And you take that feedback and you adjust, and you're thankful for it, and you get better.
[time=2144] Now, the problem with you, because you're like that, you lead like that.
[time=2151] And you think other people are like you.
[time=2154] Well, that would be nice if we lived on Mars.
[time=2159] But on planet Earth, not everyone is like you.
[time=2162] And in fact, the Bible teaches very specifically in all psychiatric research and all leadership research will also tell you that not everybody's the same, and therefore you cannot deal with every person you lead the same.
[time=2179] And that's what nice responsible leaders do, and that's where they make their mistake.
[time=2184] You've got to diagnose who you're talking to and then deal with them appropriately
[time=2190] so that you will not lose your mission or your joy.
[time=2195] So what we're going to do is we're going to give you three categories of people.
[time=2200] Now, I hate systems that put people in the categories,
[time=2206] but this is just true, I'm sorry.
[time=2210] Actually, I didn't make it up.
[time=2212] It's right there on the pages of the Bible, but it's also documented by a lot of other research, which uses a little friendlier names, but let's use the ones the Bible uses.
[time=2222] It says that some people are wise, some people are fools,
[time=2229] and some people are just plain old bad.
[time=2233] There's some bad people out there, and you know what?
[time=2236] The larger your organization gets, the more likely you're to gather these.
[time=2242] Now, sometimes if you begin something, you don't have them in the beginning because you start with friends and people you know and all this, but then people hire people and all that, and things just can get out of hand.
[time=2251] But you're going to find these in the population.
[time=2254] Now, if you're not comfortable saying that there are groups of people like this, which is kind of not true anyway, because the reality is all of us have all of these parts.
[time=2263] It's just some people kind of make a career out of one of them.
[time=2267] Now, and we're going to camp out there for a second.
[time=2269] Okay, but let's get the easy one out of the way first.
[time=2273] What is a wise person?
[time=2275] The definition or the description of a wise person is this.
[time=2280] When the light comes to them, that person adjusts themselves to match the light.
[time=2292] When the truth comes to them, they change something.
[time=2298] Themselves are something to match reality.
[time=2302] That's wisdom.
[time=2304] What does the Bible say? Correct a wise person, and he will be wiser still.
[time=2312] So how do we get better?
[time=2314] We have a character that listens to the light.
[time=2317] Sort of like the story I told yesterday.
[time=2322] At the breakfast, I said, you know, there's a dog food company and sales are bad, and dog food company owner says, fire the marketing team, get new packaging, sales still say bad, you know, the next quarter.
[time=2334] Fire them, sales still are bad.
[time=2336] Fire them.
[time=2337] He does this for about a year.
[time=2338] Finally, a little guy in the back right of his hand says, sir.
[time=2341] He says, yeah, I just says, the dogs don't like it.
[time=2344] You know a wise person does at that point?
[time=2353] We tweak the formula, but some people are so stuck.
[time=2357] We'll get to them in a minute.
[time=2359] But the wise ones tweak the formula.
[time=2361] Listen to the truth.
[time=2362] There's another quality of the wise person here, and this is one that I really love, is when you confront them, this is what you see.
[time=2371] You get a smiley face.
[time=2373] They thank you.
[time=2376] Thanks.
[time=2379] I appreciate that.
[time=2381] We can still take the before pictures.
[time=2385] That's good.
[time=2387] (Laughter) Mayor is doing a retreat for a small group of pastors that go off once a year.
[time=2397] They're from all over the country, and they lead big things.
[time=2400] And the first night I got them together, I said, so tell us what you want from this retreat.
[time=2405] And the first one says, well, I'm in an awful place.
[time=2408] I built this ministry with my best friend.
[time=2412] We've been together since youth working days, and said he just split the church and left
[time=2419] and started a new church, right at the end of a building program.
[time=2422] He said, I don't know what I'm going to do.
[time=2426] Turn to the next one.
[time=2427] He said, my wife hasn't spoken to me for six months.
[time=2432] I turn to the next, and he said, well, it's opposite for me.
[time=2434] Things are growing and booming.
[time=2435] I don't know what to do with all the success and growth, and I need help in dealing with that.
[time=2441] I turn to the next one, and he was sort of a young, kind of up-and-comer that they had included because they wanted to build into his life.
[time=2449] And I turn to him, I said, what's going on with you?
[time=2452] And he said, man, I already got what I need.
[time=2455] I said, what do you mean?
[time=2456] He said, these guys are my heroes.
[time=2458] I just found out they're screwed up Zion.
[time=2460] (Laughter) So I can go home now.
[time=2464] (Laughter) I said, well, tell us your story.
[time=2468] They told us his story, and after a little while, one of the older, wiser experience pastors
[time=2474] interrupts him.
[time=2475] He says, you want some feedback?
[time=2476] And I'll never forget this, that young pastor leaned forward, and you know, you see, the
[time=2483] fizzy lot is people's dilated.
[time=2486] He leaned forward.
[time=2487] He opens his facial muscles, shrinks diagnosed stuff like this.
[time=2492] (Laughter) And he says these words.
[time=2494] He says, yeah, man, give me a gift.
[time=2498] See, David said, a righteous man will strike me, and it will be a blessing.
[time=2503] And that's the description of the wise.
[time=2505] So they thank you.
[time=2506] So what do you do when you're leading a wise person?
[time=2509] What are the leadership strategies?
[time=2512] You talk to them.
[time=2514] Talking helps.
[time=2516] Somebody's listening.
[time=2518] So you coach them.
[time=2522] You give them feedback.
[time=2525] You resource them.
[time=2528] Now, these are the easy ones, so I'm not going to spend a lot of time here, but let me give you the leadership kind of challenge with them.
[time=2536] With the wise person, the challenge is this.
[time=2539] To make sure that they are a match for what you need.
[time=2543] You can have wise people that aren't gifted, and they're not going to make it either in the things that you're wanting them to do.
[time=2550] So they've got to be a match.
[time=2552] Bill talked about that earlier.
[time=2554] They've got to be in a place where you haven't outgrown them.
[time=2558] And then you've got to give them good feedback in coaching.
[time=2563] And then the third one is you have to keep them challenged appropriately.
[time=2570] So now you're spending more time on the wise ones because they're the ones that are easy.
[time=2576] Now let's get to the group we know and love.
[time=2580] The fool.
[time=2582] What's the description of the fool?
[time=2585] A fool basically may be the smartest cookie at the table.
[time=2590] They may be the brightest, and they may be the most gifted.
[time=2594] And oftentimes I'll tell you this, they are.
[time=2597] And that's how they've gotten as far as they've gotten with this other character problem they have because they are so gifted and because of the results they can get and their charisma.
[time=2608] And they really do produce a lot of times.
[time=2612] But here's the problem.
[time=2615] With the wise person, when the light comes, they adjust themselves to the light.
[time=2620] With the fool, when the light shows up, you know what they try to do?
[time=2627] They adjust the light.
[time=2631] It hurts their eyes.
[time=2633] They're allergic to it.
[time=2635] And they try to dim it.
[time=2637] And they try to adjust the truth.
[time=2641] See, this person changes themselves.
[time=2644] The fool will try to change the truth.
[time=2648] There's a number of ways to do that, to excuse it, minimize it.
[time=2651] Well, it wasn't that big of a problem or it's not that big of a deal.
[time=2654] Or no, you're overestimating that.
[time=2656] Or they shoot the messenger.
[time=2660] That would be you.
[time=2664] Well, if you would just give me more responsibility, you ever heard that one?
[time=2668] If you would just resource me more.
[time=2671] If you, if you, if you, and whenever you hear feedback, go into somebody and the first reflexive move is external, let that be a warning sign.
[time=2683] Because they're squinting at that point.
[time=2687] And what they're doing, I'll give you a list of them here.
[time=2691] They deny that it's reality.
[time=2694] They minimize.
[time=2695] They externalize it.
[time=2697] They shoot the messenger.
[time=2699] And see this smiley face here?
[time=2701] Not what you get.
[time=2704] They're not happy to hear this.
[time=2706] And a lot of times they get angry.
[time=2709] And they'll go have the meeting after the meeting and find somebody and kind of merge with them in a triangulation and now you're the problem.
[time=2718] And that's how splits begin to happen many, many times.
[time=2722] So how companies are divided, teams are divided, and sometimes churches as well.
[time=2728] So you've got this behavior.
[time=2730] Are you guys recognizing some people here?
[time=2733] Okay, now if you brought that person with you, you might have one have a little chat right now.
[time=2737] Not yet.
[time=2738] I haven't given you the tools yet.
[time=2740] Okay.
[time=2741] I'm here.
[time=2743] I was in a meeting with the CEO and one of his VPs.
[time=2747] And they had a big, big, big, big, big product launch.
[time=2751] And it didn't go well.
[time=2755] And part of it was because the advertising buy had not been done well at all.
[time=2761] And it was because the marketing guy had not really gotten it all done well, timely and all that.
[time=2767] And so the CEO was given a review.
[time=2769] And he instantly says, well, you know, it's because the networks had had promised us this
[time=2775] time and they had sold.
[time=2776] And the CEO says, well, you know, dealing with the networks is that's under your watch.
[time=2781] He said, yeah, but by the time, and then he goes into, you know, the production group that was delayed and this and the other CEO is going, yeah, but you're in charge of the.
[time=2790] And he kept saying this and saying this and saying this.
[time=2793] And so finally I interrupted, I said to the CEO, what are you feeling right now?
[time=2797] That's sort of a shrink thing to do, right?
[time=2799] I try not to do that business settings often, but I could see it in space.
[time=2803] And I thought it would lead to something and it did.
[time=2805] And this is what it led to.
[time=2806] One of the most important feelings that you can have as a leader.
[time=2811] Hopelessness.
[time=2814] I turned to the leader to the CEO.
[time=2815] I said, what are you feeling right now?
[time=2817] He goes, I don't know, man, I'm kind of hopeless.
[time=2820] I said, exactly.
[time=2821] You know why?
[time=2822] Because the problem is not in the room.
[time=2825] It's very hard to solve a problem that's not in the room.
[time=2830] Because every time you talk to a person like this, they do not own it.
[time=2834] And the reality is right there, but they can't make themselves part of the problem and own
[time=2841] it and take it in.
[time=2843] And when you get hopeless about that, that's one of the best things that you can ever do because you know what a nice, responsible leader does?
[time=2851] A nice, responsible leader has hope that a fool is going to one day start listening.
[time=2858] Of course, you've had this conversation 63 times, but today is the day.
[time=2864] And you've talked about this problem.
[time=2866] You know, over here, if you're talking about problems, you're talking about problem A and it goes away and then B and it goes away.
[time=2871] And over here, it's like, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, it'll send you to AA after all this,
[time=2878] right?
[time=2881] And see, that's the deal.
[time=2882] You've got to get hopeless.
[time=2885] You know the definition of insanity?
[time=2888] Continuing to do the same thing, expecting different results.
[time=2891] So here's what the Bible says and here's what all research would validate.
[time=2896] With the wise person, you talk to them, why talking helps?
[time=2900] Confront, rebuke, correct, a wise person.
[time=2904] And they will love you for it and they will thank you for it and they will get better.
[time=2908] So talk to them.
[time=2910] But then the Bible changes its tone or its advice.
[time=2914] And it says, do not confront or correct a fool.
[time=2922] It gets even better, it says, lest you incur insults upon yourself.
[time=2927] That's the shoot, the messenger.
[time=2930] Do not confront a mocker lest they hate you.
[time=2933] And if you look through these verses, it's incredible.
[time=2936] It describes reality like you've never seen it before.
[time=2939] And it basically says, here's your strategy, stop talking.
[time=2946] Stop it.
[time=2948] You know why?
[time=2951] They have stopped your vision.
[time=2954] They stopped the plan.
[time=2956] You're no longer in charge of your mission.
[time=2961] Their allergy to reality has now gotten in charge.
[time=2965] And it's your job as a leader to take stewardship over this and stop the insanity.
[time=2970] So we stop talking.
[time=2972] And we have a different kind of a conversation.
[time=2975] And we call the man and you say, you know what Joe?
[time=2978] You know how we've talked about "A" and "A" and "A" and "A" and "A"?
[time=2984] Talking about problems and all these issues.
[time=2987] You know what, I don't want to talk about problems anymore.
[time=2990] I'm kind of done talking about problems.
[time=2993] I want to talk about a new problem.
[time=2997] They're talking about problems with you, it doesn't help.
[time=3001] I want to have that conversation.
[time=3005] And you begin to get out of the weeds and you take it up to the pattern.
[time=3013] That I don't know how to give you feedback in a way that it changes anything.
[time=3020] I'm hopeless.
[time=3022] So let me tell you what I do when I'm hopeless.
[time=3027] I've got to protect our vision.
[time=3035] I've got to protect the next quarterly's results.
[time=3039] I've got to protect the culture of this team or whatever the problem is.
[time=3045] And we're going to stop talking about the issues.
[time=3049] And we're going to talk about this issue that talking doesn't help.
[time=3054] And we're going to do something different.
[time=3057] I'm going to have some limits here.
[time=3060] Because I'm going to limit my exposure to this problem.
[time=3063] And if that means that I can't have you be in charge of this project, I need to limit my exposure because I cannot lose another product launch.
[time=3074] Or I cannot lose another ministry launch.
[time=3078] Or I cannot continue to have meetings with people that you've gone in and blown up at and they come crying into my office.
[time=3086] I'm going to limit my exposure to that.
[time=3091] What I want from you is I want to know how I can talk to you
[time=3098] where what I talk about makes a difference.
[time=3101] Can you please tell me how to do that?
[time=3103] I really want to do it.
[time=3106] And this is where you get soft and you get loving.
[time=3109] It may be that they're foolish for shame reasons or fear reasons that they give excuses and this, that, and the other.
[time=3117] Because to own something makes them so bad.
[time=3119] And if you can get to, you know, why is it hard for you?
[time=3122] What do you feel when I correct you?
[time=3124] And some of them will get honest and say, I just feel so bad.
[time=3127] I was in a meeting not too long ago and saw a high level leader actually start to tear up and he said, I don't know.
[time=3134] I just feel like I've let everybody down.
[time=3138] And that's when the team rallied around him and they connected for the first time and he could hear it.
[time=3145] And so if you ask them, what is it about this that's so hard?
[time=3149] And if they say, well, because you, and it's true, then fine.
[time=3152] I won't do it like that anymore.
[time=3153] How do you want it?
[time=3155] People want feedback in different ways.
[time=3157] You want me to send flowers when I give it to you?
[time=3159] What do you need?
[time=3162] Let's find a way that it works.
[time=3164] But then you go to a second question.
[time=3166] OK, I'm going to do that, Joe.
[time=3169] But I want to know this.
[time=3171] What will we do if I do it and then it doesn't happen?
[time=3178] I want to plan so we know if we have this conversation again and I do what you want and nothing changes.
[time=3185] What are we going to do then?
[time=3187] And there you get specific about what the consequences are going to be.
[time=3191] Now they might say, well, can you show me that I'm doing it again?
[time=3194] And see, now you've got a listener.
[time=3196] But if they don't, you've got to have consequences.
[time=3198] It may mean that they get moved out of the position.
[time=3201] Or it may be in some cases you give them a chance to go be successful somewhere else.
[time=3207] There are extreme consequences.
[time=3209] There are minor consequences.
[time=3211] But here is the principle.
[time=3213] Fools do not change with truth coming to them that they can get rid of.
[time=3220] They don't change when truth comes to them that they must camp out in and feel.
[time=3225] And when the pain of not changing becomes greater than the pain of changing.
[time=3231] You know what I love about fools?
[time=3234] Besides being a recovering fool?
[time=3238] There's great hope for fools.
[time=3241] Jesus died for fools.
[time=3243] All of us are foolish to some degree.
[time=3246] And if we can lead them right, instead of thinking they're listening and realizing they're not
[time=3252] listening and lead them with consequences and structure, then fools can change.
[time=3257] And you can redeem a career and a position and a giftedness if you do what leadership
[time=3264] requires.
[time=3265] But that takes guts.
[time=3267] And sometimes these are the hardest calls that you ever made.
[time=3270] So what have we seen?
[time=3271] You got the strategy changing and the leadership challenge here, I said earlier, it was to match,
[time=3280] remember, to match the giftedness and then to give the good feedback and then challenge
[time=3289] them.
[time=3290] Well, with the fool, the leadership challenge is you've got to limit your exposure.
[time=3295] You've got to make it clear about the consequences.
[time=3300] You've got to give them a choice and then you've got to follow through.
[time=3307] And I say it like this, I usually have leaders say to these people, you know what?
[time=3315] What I need in that chair that you sit in, in that position, I need somebody that can hear what we need and can hear reality.
[time=3324] And that's what I'm going to have in that position.
[time=3327] I hope that you, I want you to be in that chair.
[time=3332] But that's what that chair is going to require.
[time=3336] And you get to make the choice is what you're going to do.
[time=3341] And then lastly, I wish I didn't have to do this, talk about this category.
[time=3346] Won't spend a lot of time on it, but if the strategy here is to resource people because wise people, you know, I've told you about them, evil people need a different strategy.
[time=3356] Why?
[time=3357] Because they have destruction in their hearts, they want to inflict pain.
[time=3364] And I've seen this and you've got to believe it.
[time=3367] If you're an optimistic loving person, it's so hard to get you to believe that there truly
[time=3373] are bad people in the world.
[time=3375] And sometimes when you try to give them truth and I've seen it in board meetings, I've seen it at high levels of leadership, I have seen people stand up in a board room and turn and point their finger and say, I will bring this place down.
[time=3391] Destruction is in their heart.
[time=3392] And that's why the Bible says where Paul writes to pastors reject, reject a divisive
[time=3402] person after a second warning, have nothing to do with them.
[time=3408] And there are people, and there are people in churches sometimes that you can't talk to because they're evil, you can't fix them by giving them feedback.
[time=3416] So we have a different strategy.
[time=3418] And over here, it's lawyers, guns and money.
[time=3425] Lawyer's guns and money.
[time=3426] We go into protection mode.
[time=3428] And you say, I'll only talk to you through my attorney and you get ready because they're going to sue you.
[time=3433] And you give funds to that.
[time=3435] And sometimes you have to call the police and I've seen it happen.
[time=3440] And that's just a little piece of advice for you leaders who are so loving that you cannot believe that anybody would be like that.
[time=3448] They very well could be sitting in one of your pews.
[time=3451] And the Bible promises that they are.
[time=3454] So I'll leave you with this.
[time=3457] God has called you to lead people.
[time=3460] And sometimes it's not about the plan, there could be five good plans.
[time=3463] It's about getting the people to be able to work the plan.
[time=3467] And that's what leadership often comes down to.
[time=3470] And in your army out there, you're going to have wise ones, fools and evil ones.
[time=3476] Take the leadership challenge to not let somebody's character problem stop your mission that
[time=3485] God has called you to.
[time=3486] God bless you.
