[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It is good to be with you and I wanted to share with you today something that would mean a great deal to us and that is the opportunity to hear from you.
[time=42] We love hearing from you.
[time=44] We've always enjoyed the opportunity whenever it would present itself for you to share with us things that God is putting on your heart, things he's bringing to mind.
[time=53] And in these days at Black Hawk, as most of you know, we're now making our way through a series that we've entitled, The Untouchables.
[time=63] We're actually talking about issues that the church oftentimes avoids.
[time=68] We're trying to go to the Word of God and see what the scriptures have to say about certain topics that today in our world and culture, oftentimes the church either avoids or gets drastically wrong.
[time=81] And so as we go through these four or five weeks, we wanted to make open to you the opportunity to ask your questions, to share with us your feedback.
[time=91] And so what we want to do is this.
[time=93] We want you to use our Twitter that you see on the screen here, use our Facebook page.
[time=99] Again, all of this is on the screen.
[time=102] You can text us at the text number that's shown here, Twitter, Facebook, text.
[time=107] You can just email me or you know what you can call.
[time=110] Either way, all the information is right there on the screen and as you listen to these messages and as you think about what we're saying, what God's Word is saying, whatever questions you might have about any of these topics, homosexuality, social justice, politics, singleness,
[time=129] and things of this nature.
[time=131] Write in your questions, send us your questions, and on the fifth week of the series, we're going to take the entire morning and answer all the questions that have come in or or most of them if we can.
[time=142] And so we'd love to hear from you.
[time=143] I know that God's Word can bring clarity on these issues.
[time=147] It really can.
[time=148] And if you're struggling with or interested in knowing more about these things, I hope you'll be with us week after week and I hope we can answer your questions along the way.
[time=157] God bless you.
[time=158] Thank you for being part of our family.
[time=160] Thanks for tuning in and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=163] [MUSIC]
[time=183] [APPLAUSE]
[time=189] [MUSIC - 259 seconds]
[time=451] All right.
[time=457] Well, we've been talking about it for a while.
[time=459] Today, we begin a new series that we have entitled Untouchables.
[time=464] A couple of things first, just about the title, Untouchables, Homosexuality, Justice, Politics, Singleness.
[time=471] What we've decided to do here, my friends, is really just take some issues that, for a number of different reasons, the church as a whole, usually, in a lot of cases, just avoids.
[time=484] Sometimes because of all that is implied, sometimes because of all that is involved, sometimes because of the delicateness or the diciness of the issue, these issues.
[time=494] Oftentimes, the church just chooses to remain silent.
[time=499] And in the process, I believe the church leaves its people then uninformed and uneducated in terms of scriptural truth on how it is they should not only view but deal with these real life everyday issues.
[time=513] And so it is our desire to, with great sensitivity and with real conviction to the word of God, deal with, talk about, inform, educate, and hopefully give us a sense of understanding on these issues.
[time=527] There are other issues we could have dealt with.
[time=529] These are simply the four that we as a team felt like God wanted us to address, and so we will address and teach on these things as the weeks go by.
[time=539] The format will be very simple.
[time=541] This is how we'll come at this this morning with homosexuality.
[time=545] It's how we'll come at the rest of the weeks.
[time=547] We want to, first of all, look and see what God's word has to say on the issue.
[time=553] Secondly, we do that because if you're new here, we do that because it is our ultimate and absolute authority.
[time=562] Here, the word of God is what we follow.
[time=564] Here, the word of God is what we listen to.
[time=567] We look to it to inform and decide and guide our lives.
[time=574] And so first of all, we will look at the word of God.
[time=576] Second of all, we will look and consider culture's message on these things, but then thirdly, we'll come back and look at our response.
[time=586] In light of what God's word says, even in the midst of what culture may be promoting, what should our response, what should our heart and mindset be on these issues?
[time=597] Make sense?
[time=598] All right, well, let's jump in.
[time=600] This morning, we come to homosexuality.
[time=602] It is quite possible, in my opinion, that in the past 25 years, there has been no other issue, more polarizing or more controversial or more destructive within the confines of the church and our society than the issue of homosexuality.
[time=623] It has infuriated some.
[time=624] It has confused others.
[time=627] It has sparked both compassion and anger, both debate and disdain.
[time=632] It has divided families' churches.
[time=635] It has broken apart denominations.
[time=637] It has divided and enraged political parties.
[time=642] It has angered.
[time=642] It has disillusioned and discouraged our nation.
[time=647] Let me ask you this, how does it make you feel?
[time=651] I wonder what thoughts and what words and what scenarios
[time=657] and what pictures, I wonder what kind of sentiment runs through you as we begin this morning to introduce the idea and the issue of homosexuality.
[time=670] What do you think, I wonder, how have you been trained?
[time=674] How is it that you view this?
[time=677] You know, the problem is-- well, there's a lot of problems with this, but here's one problem.
[time=685] I said earlier that the church oftentimes avoids this.
[time=692] Well, there's a flip side to that.
[time=693] And it really does represent a problem because so many times the church, those claiming to be of God, so many times they do address it.
[time=704] And in the way they address it, completely and utterly miss the heart of God, much less the word of God.
[time=715] And in missing it, they show their ignorance.
[time=717] They show their arrogance.
[time=719] They show their hatefulness.
[time=722] And so while many times it's untouchable, while many times we just stay away all together, there are other times when, wow, things get said that don't at all represent our heart.
[time=734] And I want you to watch this.
[time=736] This would be an example.
[time=737] I was shocked.
[time=738] There were pages and pages and pages of videos and articles when I started looking into this.
[time=744] But anyway, I want you to watch this.
[time=746] This is just an example of how horrible it can be at times in the name of God and truth.
[time=754] Listen, of our president getting up and saying that it was all right to marry or to men to marry, I'll tell you right now, I was disappointed bad.
[time=767] But I'll tell you right there, as you're sorry, as you can get the Bibles again and God's again.
[time=773] I'm again it.
[time=774] And if you've got any sense, you're again it.
[time=777] I had to wait.
[time=781] I figured a way out, a way to get rid of all the lesbians and queers, but I couldn't get it past the Congress.
[time=791] Build a great, big, large fence, 150 or 100 mile long,
[time=798] put all the lesbians in there, fly over and drop some food.
[time=803] Do the same thing with the queers and the homosexuals.
[time=809] And have that fist electrified to let them get out, feed them.
[time=814] And you know what, in a few years they'll die out.
[time=818] Do you know why they can't reproduce?
[time=819] It's an absolute unspeakable offense at church on Sunday
[time=831] morning, an offense to basic human dignity, all in the name of God's truth.
[time=837] The pastor's comments seem in line with statements made by men like Ron Beatty, founding pastor of Berean Baptist Church in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, head of the anti-marriage equality organization who told his own congregation recently that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people should be persecuted and prosecuted as they were historically.
[time=861] And it's in line with Pastor Sean Harris of the Berean Baptist Church in Fayetteville, North Carolina, who advocated parents punch their male child if he is effeminate and crack that wrist if it ever goes limp.
[time=875] I play that ridiculous, offensive bit of footage
[time=882] only to show you how in many real churches today there are real pastors, I guess, speaking about this issue
[time=893] with hearts filled with hate, violence, and ignorance.
[time=899] And I want you to know that here at Blackhawk, we don't view the issue or, more importantly, the individuals within the issue that way at all.
[time=915] That is not how we come at this.
[time=919] That is not the spirit with which we see this.
[time=924] That is not something that we would ever, ever condone.
[time=928] And I only showed it to you to simply help you understand how important it would be that we would have an educated, scripturally, God breathed, God informed approach and view on this thing that would allow us to represent the heart of God and not destroy it like he just did.
[time=950] We view the issue here in this place.
[time=959] We view the issue and all who are engaged in it in the light of and the clarity provided by God's word.
[time=970] And I'll just say that to you again.
[time=971] We view this issue and those who are engaged in the issue
[time=977] from the light and clarity provided by Holy Scripture.
[time=982] The government doesn't inform our view.
[time=985] Culture doesn't inform our view.
[time=988] Hollywood doesn't inform our view.
[time=992] No, it is the light and clarity of God's word that brings warning, it brings boundaries, it brings judgment,
[time=1004] and don't forget it brings hope.
[time=1007] The light and the clarity of God's word on the issue of homosexuality, bringing boundaries, bringing warning, bringing judgment, and bringing hope.
[time=1018] And so let's do that.
[time=1019] Let's look at God's word.
[time=1020] Open up your Bibles this morning.
[time=1022] Let's look at a few passages that speak to the issue.
[time=1025] Turning with me first of all to 1 Corinthians chapter 6.
[time=1029] 1 Corinthians chapter 6, we're going to start in verse 9.
[time=1033] Paul's letter to the church at Corinth, 1 Corinthians 6 verse 9
[time=1040] says right there in verse 9, so important that we as a family would understand the meaning of this passage, or do you not know, he says, that the unrighteous-- everybody say that word, unrighteous.
[time=1057] The unrighteous will not inherit the what?
[time=1060] Say it.
[time=1062] The kingdom of God, or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?
[time=1069] Don't be deceived.
[time=1070] It's not going to happen.
[time=1071] They're not going to inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=1075] Well, who do you mean?
[time=1076] Here we go.
[time=1077] Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers,
[time=1092] none of them, all of them will be kept from.
[time=1097] They will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=1100] Such were-- now listen, such were some of you.
[time=1105] But you were what?
[time=1106] You were washed.
[time=1107] But you were sanctified.
[time=1109] But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the spirit of our God.
[time=1116] And I want you to see in that passage right there, minus, minus, the last couple of verses.
[time=1122] Those last couple of verses where it says, people came to faith in Christ.
[time=1127] Minus salvation, minus redemption, minus somebody coming to a place of being restored by the work of Christ.
[time=1137] Minus that, you don't inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=1143] If you choose to live life on your own and on your own, whatever your sinful bent may be, whatever your sinful direction may look like, he gave you about nine of them here.
[time=1158] And he didn't rank them, he just gave them to you.
[time=1162] None of them inherit the kingdom of God unless there is salvation.
[time=1171] No place in heaven, 1 Corinthians 6, 9 to 11, says it right there.
[time=1176] And we believe, I believe, that's true.
[time=1182] Romans 1, let's keep going.
[time=1185] Actually, go back to Romans 1 in your Bibles.
[time=1188] First chapter in Paul's letter to the church at Rome, we're going to pick it up in verse 26.
[time=1194] Romans 1, 26, wow, what an incredible, it's not like amazing good, it's just amazing powerful.
[time=1200] Boy, there is so much here.
[time=1203] I want to just, we're going to start in 26, but I want to remind you that in 19, in 1 19,
[time=1212] he said that everybody on the earth knows within them what is true and right about God.
[time=1221] God gave everybody on the earth, that understanding of him and who he is and what this is about, people on their own begin to, left to themselves, Romans 1, pinks this picture of people beginning to spiral away from that, left to ourselves.
[time=1241] We begin to move toward greater levels of sin and depravity in 24.
[time=1247] It says, therefore, God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity and then it paints this picture of increasing depraved impurity.
[time=1259] And man, it just gets ugly.
[time=1260] And then in 26, watch this.
[time=1263] And then in 26, it gets a little uglier.
[time=1266] The spiral away from God begins to go even further.
[time=1270] For this reason, 26, God gave them over to degrading passions.
[time=1276] Passions, what's going on here is he gives them over even more so.
[time=1280] And what does this stage look like?
[time=1285] For their women exchanged the natural function for that which is what?
[time=1292] Say it, church, say it again.
[time=1297] And in the same way and in the same unnatural way, also the men abandoned the natural function
[time=1308] of the woman, man with woman.
[time=1312] And instead burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own bodies the du penalty, receiving in their own persons the du penalty of their error.
[time=1328] One thing I wanna note there is that word natural, that word unnatural.
[time=1335] We won't go into this at length.
[time=1336] I just wanna make sure you understand this.
[time=1338] I think most of you do, but if you don't, let me just clue you in.
[time=1342] Media, Hollywood, Madison Avenue, however you wanna say it, please know this.
[time=1348] They have been trying for about 25 years and they are not tired.
[time=1352] They are just now gaining steam and it will go further and it will get uglier and it will continue to be constant.
[time=1360] They are trying their best to help you and your kids understand that homosexuality, immorality, adultery, fornication, you name it, they want you to think it's natural.
[time=1375] They just want you to look at it and go, you know what, it's know what, big deal.
[time=1382] And I wanna just remind you here in the text here in the very words of God that He gave to you and need to inform us and how we will live.
[time=1392] God says there is natural, i.e. what He designed and there's unnatural.
[time=1398] Unnatural is where our sinful, depraved, degenerate minds and lives and thoughts go to when we separate ourselves from Him.
[time=1411] And just as they, verse 28, now watch, He gave them over in 24, He gave them over even more in 26 and it was in 26 and 27 where we see homosexuality, well now what?
[time=1426] Well it goes even further.
[time=1429] You say, wait a minute, I thought homosexuality was as bad as it gets.
[time=1435] Is that what you think?
[time=1437] Well 28 and just as they did not see to fit, as just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God at that point, God gave them over even more.
[time=1448] To a depraved mind, to do those things, what He's about to say are things that God says are not proper, to do those things which are not proper.
[time=1460] Here is the worst of the worst.
[time=1464] Being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, wanting too much money.
[time=1471] Evil, full of envy, it's called jealousy.
[time=1478] Murder, strife, strife, not getting along.
[time=1484] Deceit lying, malice saying mean things.
[time=1492] They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents.
[time=1501] Without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful, this is the bottom of the barrel.
[time=1510] And although they know the ordinance of God back to verse 19, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.
[time=1525] The moral personal decline on its way to absolute utter
[time=1532] depravity when life is lived apart from relationship with God.
[time=1537] And He just gave you about three, four stages.
[time=1541] And in the middle there, we saw homosexuality.
[time=1546] Wasn't what God designed.
[time=1547] It's not how He wanted us to live.
[time=1550] It's not the experience that He had in mind for men or women.
[time=1555] What He had in mind was natural where we go in our sinfulness unnatural.
[time=1562] First Timothy, let's go there.
[time=1566] Go back in your New Testament, go past first and second Thessalonians.
[time=1570] Let's just again take a look at what it says.
[time=1572] First Timothy chapter one, we'll pick it up in verse eight.
[time=1577] Paul says here in his letter to Timothy, the young pastor trying to navigate his way through these things.
[time=1582] He says, but we know that the law is good.
[time=1585] If one uses it lawfully, realizing the fact that the law was not made for a righteous person but for those who are lawless and rebellious.
[time=1597] It brings conviction to the ungodly and sinners for the unholy and profane for those who kill their fathers and mothers for murderers and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and purgers and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching.
[time=1616] Anything, anyone, any circumstance, contrary to sound teaching.
[time=1623] According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.
[time=1630] My friends, God's designed His desire.
[time=1636] Please know this, was from the beginning and still is today for sexual intimacy to be experienced between a man and a woman who are married to each other.
[time=1648] If you're experiencing sexual intimacy outside of marriage,
[time=1656] not God's design, it won't be honored,
[time=1662] it won't be blessed, it's disobedient, he'll judge it.
[time=1667] If you're experiencing sexual intimacy with someone of the same sex, it's not what God designed.
[time=1673] It's not what He intended, it's not how He built us.
[time=1675] If that's what you choose, God won't miss it, He'll see it.
[time=1683] Homosexual or same-sex experiences, relationships or unions are thus outside the lines of God's divine plan for sex and as such, are sinful actions which bring with them serious consequences, sinful actions which bring with them serious consequences.
[time=1702] Homosexuality, just like as we've read, just like adultery, just like anger, just like greed, just like gluttony, just like lust, just like murder,
[time=1718] just like disobeying parents, just like idolatry,
[time=1724] anything that violates God's requirement is sinful and carries with it the consequence of that sin.
[time=1733] We believe that, believe that to be true,
[time=1739] we believe that to be right in terms of God's design and we believe that to be right in terms of how He sees that and how He is able to respond because He's God.
[time=1749] Now what does culture say?
[time=1752] Well, you could stand up here and you could all tell me what culture says, you know what culture says, you hear it, you see it, you experience it every day, our world's message, society's message, if you will, today is really as it's always been, maybe it's a little louder, maybe it's a little bolder, maybe it's a little more brazen, it certainly is more constant, right?
[time=1775] But the message is clear, there are no moral restraints that can or should be imposed, there are no absolutes, culture cries.
[time=1788] Sexual activity of any kind is simply the choice and right of the individual and as such, should not be mandated in any way, shape or form.
[time=1798] You can do, choose, whatever you wanna do, do whatever you feel like doing with whoever you feel like doing it with, whenever you feel like doing it.
[time=1809] You answer to no one but yourself.
[time=1812] You dictate what's acceptable, personal feelings and one's own fulfillment should inform all moral sexual decisions.
[time=1822] Did I miss that?
[time=1825] Does that sound accurate to you?
[time=1830] Is it what you see in the theater?
[time=1836] Is it what you see on TV?
[time=1839] Is it what you hear on the radio?
[time=1841] Is it the message that you receive?
[time=1845] 'Cause it certainly is the message I'm getting.
[time=1848] All right, well, what should our response be?
[time=1855] How should Christ followers?
[time=1860] 'Cause that's what we're trying to be around here at least, right?
[time=1864] We're not trying to be church attenders.
[time=1867] We're not trying to be religious.
[time=1869] We're trying to be people who have fully surrendered our hearts and lives to the Son of God.
[time=1876] And it is our hope and our desire that you would be and I would be and all of us here at Black Hawk would be growing in our willingness to follow Him.
[time=1884] And so if we're gonna follow Jesus and live out our faith in Him, what should our response be to this issue?
[time=1893] What should our response be to these individuals and how should we as a church family somehow find a road to walk through this path that's different than what we saw on the screen earlier?
[time=1909] What should the posture of our church be toward the issue
[time=1915] and those associated with it?
[time=1917] Well, I hope you'll make a note here.
[time=1919] Our response should be biblical and balanced.
[time=1928] Let me just talk about that for a second and let me just start by saying very clearly, let me just make sure that nobody leaves here thinking in some way, shape, or form.
[time=1939] I said something else.
[time=1941] So let me just be very clear right here.
[time=1943] Our response should be, you and I should, in light of scripture, be informed to the reality that God says on this issue, no.
[time=1952] No, not at all.
[time=1959] And it's very important that you understand that my understanding of scripture and our commitment to this issue is that there is a period after no.
[time=1971] There's no comma, no dot dot dot.
[time=1979] It's no.
[time=1981] And we've already talked about 10 or 12 other issues.
[time=1985] I'll lump there right with it where he says the same thing to, right?
[time=1988] What?
[time=1990] No.
[time=1991] It just says no, it's not how I designed it.
[time=1993] It's not what I have in mind.
[time=1996] It's not what I want you to do.
[time=2000] No.
[time=2000] Now, remember, it's interesting what we do
[time=2006] with this topic, I think, because remember, he has said no to a lot of things, hasn't he?
[time=2015] He has said no, and he has, even in the passages we've gone to today, he has been absolutely clear on his no as it relates to a number of lifestyles, a number of choices, a number of inequities.
[time=2034] Oh man, we do something with this issue.
[time=2038] It's really interesting.
[time=2041] I was just looking at some things up this week, and I just want to make sure that we're informed.
[time=2048] I want to make sure that your view of this is as it should be, I want to make sure that our view of this whole issue of sin and lifestyle and choices, this week,
[time=2064] this week, 45, 40 million Americans.
[time=2069] 40 million Americans this week will visit porn websites.
[time=2073] And in most cases, they'll do it two to three to four times a day.
[time=2078] Of the 40 million, one in three are women, and 70% of the 40 million are young men between the ages of 18 and 24.
[time=2091] 25 million people last year were enrolled in anger management courses.
[time=2098] Not all of them, but some of them, spiritually oriented to help people with the sin of anger and the destruction that it brings.
[time=2109] 25 million enrolled in anger management.
[time=2112] 40 million will visit porn sites this week.
[time=2115] An estimated 70 million people are suffering from obesity, not all of which is due to, but a majority of which is due to gluttony.
[time=2124] 68% of all adults are overweight, 65 million Americans
[time=2132] are suffering from alcohol and drug addiction.
[time=2135] Eight million are gay, less than 4%.
[time=2147] You say, well, what are you trying to say?
[time=2150] I'm not trying to say anything.
[time=2152] I'm just trying to help you and I understand that we ought to be concerned about it all.
[time=2159] It all ought to make your skin crawl.
[time=2165] It all ought to make you sick.
[time=2170] It all should be an absolute utter offense to you.
[time=2177] And yet we do something with this issue.
[time=2181] Makes it difficult.
[time=2182] It really does within the church.
[time=2185] How should Christ followers approach this issue?
[time=2189] Biblically in balance, the answer is no.
[time=2192] Personally, personally, I will never condone what God has said is unnatural.
[time=2198] We will, as a church, never condone it politically.
[time=2201] Let me say this, politically.
[time=2204] I will continue to encourage you, as I have for years, to within the confines of this country and constitution that we live under, I will always encourage you to vote.
[time=2213] I will always encourage you to vote your faith and your conscious and your conviction.
[time=2218] But they'll call me sometimes and I'll have people ask me, you know, come march against these people.
[time=2225] Well, I'm not gonna go march against these people.
[time=2228] You know why?
[time=2229] Am I not gonna march because I don't think God's word speaks to it?
[time=2232] No, I'm not gonna march because I'm studying for a message on Sunday that I believe can equip and inform you to live out your faith and make a bigger difference than a march.
[time=2243] And we will continue to teach you this.
[time=2246] We will continue to equip you with this.
[time=2248] We'll continue to invest this into your kids and your sons and daughters and to you and to senior.
[time=2254] We'll continue to spend our time diligently, vigilantly teaching you and pouring this into your life so that you can in the workplace and so that you can at home and so that you can in your neighborhood march by the way you live and the way you interact with and the words you speak that are hopefully consistent with the heart of God and the word of God and are able to be communicated with both truth and love.
[time=2284] Hopefully that's what we'll do with our time.
[time=2287] We're not gonna march.
[time=2289] We're gonna continue to teach people the truth of God's word, amen?
[time=2296] Now some will come to me still under the heading of biblical response.
[time=2301] Some will come to me and say, Kelly, I can't help but I was born this way.
[time=2306] They'll say I was born this way.
[time=2311] From my earliest recollection, I had a leaning toward this.
[time=2316] And I just wanna help you understand how I deal with that, what my response and what I believe our response should be to that.
[time=2326] If you just flip the issue.
[time=2327] If somebody came to me, just imagine, if somebody came to me and they said, Kelly, from the earliest days of my recollection, I believe God made me to be an adulterer.
[time=2337] It's just always been in me.
[time=2341] I just, from the earliest that I can remember, I've had this inclination toward having sexual relationships with people who aren't my spouse.
[time=2350] And I just feel like, Kelly, I feel like you should just let me be, what?
[time=2356] Me, they say.
[time=2358] Well, nobody says that to me.
[time=2361] Nobody comes to me and says, you know what?
[time=2365] I was just born, I was just born angry.
[time=2368] And I know it's destructive and I know it's horrible, but I wish you'd just let me be angry because it's just what I wanna do and I wish you'd just let me be me.
[time=2376] I was born a glutton.
[time=2377] Just let me eat myself into oblivion and destroy my family.
[time=2383] So pick your issue.
[time=2385] What I say to all of them lovingly, but forthrightly is this, you were not born an adulterer.
[time=2393] Genesis 1, 27 says that we were born,
[time=2399] that we were made even before we were born.
[time=2401] It says we were made in the image of who?
[time=2403] Say it, you were made, you were conceived, you were formed in the image of God.
[time=2412] And all of his purity and all of his righteousness and all of his goodness and all of his perfection.
[time=2418] That is the cast, that's the mold.
[time=2421] That's what you were made to be.
[time=2424] You were made in the image of a holy righteous God.
[time=2429] I believe that because it's what God's word says.
[time=2434] I also believe because of God's word says it that because of Genesis 3, because of Adam and Eve and the serpent and the fruit and that whole sin thing.
[time=2444] I believe that that image got cracked.
[time=2448] It got tainted, it got dropped.
[time=2452] And it still functions, you still function, but that image of God got really, really dinged.
[time=2459] And so we live with a brokenness
[time=2465] and all the manifestations.
[time=2467] You wanna go back and read them all? There's many, all of them.
[time=2471] All of the manifestations of our brokenness are sinful.
[time=2476] You pick it, unacceptable in the sight of God.
[time=2482] Not at all what he requires, destructive, sinful.
[time=2487] And if we don't surrender, listen.
[time=2490] And if we don't surrender, our broken, gay, greedy, gluttonous, lustful, angry hearts to God and with the forgiveness and salvation
[time=2504] that only he can provide, commit to follow his son and not our sinful bents, we will be lost forever.
[time=2513] And yes, that is your choice.
[time=2518] You get to choose.
[time=2522] You've got a sinful bent.
[time=2523] I've got a sinful bent, your image and my image and the image of God, yours is as cracked as mine.
[time=2530] And it looks like it looks for you and it looks like it looks for me and it's all heinous and awful and sinful.
[time=2537] And minus the blood of Christ, minus the forgiveness found and the life found in Christ, we will be lost.
[time=2549] We will not inherit the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2551] Not because you're gay.
[time=2554] You don't not inherit the kingdom because you're gay
[time=2560] or because you're angry or a glutton.
[time=2563] No, those are all symptoms of unrighteousness.
[time=2567] You don't inherit the kingdom because you're sinful and you never trusted Christ for the forgiveness that you and I desperately needed.
[time=2579] I wanna remind you, I know most of you in the room are okay with this.
[time=2584] I know most of you understand this.
[time=2586] There are forgiven homosexuals in heaven.
[time=2591] There are forgiven gluttons and angry people
[time=2598] and adulterers and murderers in heaven.
[time=2601] Hope you can meet Paul someday.
[time=2602] The worst of the worst have experienced forgiveness and because they made it right with God through the person of Christ, they inherited the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2618] That's biblical, that's balanced.
[time=2623] And, and don't forget this, please hear me.
[time=2626] Once you do, oh please don't miss this.
[time=2629] Once you do, as you maybe wanna know, there are some here today who are struggling with this issue of homosexuality.
[time=2639] Once you do come to a place of faith in Christ and devote yourself to honoring God first and foremost and following his son, are you and your unique sinful struggles over?
[time=2653] Yes or no?
[time=2654] No.
[time=2655] Boy, you all said that kind of loud.
[time=2657] (congregation laughing) We got a bunch of strugglers in here, don't we?
[time=2662] Anybody in here not on this list?
[time=2665] I didn't think so.
[time=2669] No, your struggle?
[time=2670] Man, I wish it was, I wish it was different.
[time=2675] I wish somehow I could say to you somehow coming to faith in Christ makes it all go away.
[time=2681] But it doesn't.
[time=2684] No, our brokenness will stay with us and the struggle will remain strong until glory.
[time=2690] And this is where our second response comes in.
[time=2696] I hope you'll just jot this down.
[time=2698] We should be biblical and balanced and we should secondly be supportive, gracious and uncompromising all at the same time.
[time=2708] I know I don't need to stand here and tell you that over the 25 years or so of ministry I've sat with people in my office.
[time=2715] I've sat with people in living rooms.
[time=2718] I have sat with people in cars where we just needed privacy.
[time=2722] I've sat with brothers and sisters who have wept.
[time=2726] I've sat with friends of mine who have just balled their eyes out so distraught and so sad and so sorry and so fed up and so weary of their struggle with pornography or their struggle with lying or their struggle with drugs or their struggle with drinking.
[time=2746] I've sat with so many who have just poured out their hearts just saying, Kelly, kind of saying to God, oh God, why, why can't I be done with this?
[time=2755] And when I say that to you right now, the room is immediately filled with compassion, isn't it?
[time=2765] You feel it, I feel it.
[time=2766] And what I want you to know is that even in recent weeks I've sat with those.
[time=2772] I've sat with young men who have cried out and voiced
[time=2779] their absolute disdain for the same sex attraction pull they feel inside them.
[time=2785] I've listened to men and women over the years who have confided in me because they're afraid to confide in you but they've confided in me that they live in a community like this and they want truly down deep inside.
[time=2802] They want nothing to do with what they feel bent toward and they cry out for help and they cry out for accountability and they want desperately to honor God.
[time=2814] There are men and women who struggle with homosexual sin
[time=2821] who want to honor and obey God in his design, his commands and his word.
[time=2826] I've met them, I've talked with them and they, like many of you, as you live in your lust and your anger and your greed and your gossip, violating God's laws on a regular basis, they just like you, they know it's wrong and they want help and encouragement and accountability to do and choose what is honoring to God.
[time=2847] I've met many, I've read about others,
[time=2853] there's a growing number of Christians who struggle with this bent today who are now committing in mass.
[time=2862] I can show you where to read about it.
[time=2864] They're committing in mass to lives of celibacy for as long as that struggle remains in them.
[time=2872] They're committing in mass to purity, they're committing in mass to try and somehow navigate this road and not succumb at all to this sinful broken bent in them.
[time=2883] Now there are some, there are many who aren't humble.
[time=2892] Right? There are many who are angry and militant
[time=2898] and abusive and pushy and they've got a bone to pick and they're coming after whoever they can come after and they're rude and they're abrasive and they've got agendas and they could affect a whole lot in our world and I want you to hear me say this, I am trying my best.
[time=2923] To be gracious, trying my best to stand for what is true, I'm trying my best to speak what I believe is God's heart but all their anger and all their militant stuff and all of their attitude, you've got to understand as do I that they're broken.
[time=2939] They too are broken and they too are struggling with a story I'm sure that were we to know it at least should, I don't know if it would, break our hearts and so it is for you and I to be like Jesus, did Jesus cower, did Jesus walk away, did Jesus say nothing?
[time=2960] No, now Jesus stood with strength and Jesus said what was true but he always spoke the truth and what in love and he saved the harsh stuff.
[time=2970] He did the butt kick and with the guys that knew better.
[time=2975] Right? With the religious people.
[time=2978] No, his heart broke for the woman at the well.
[time=2982] His heart broke for those who were steeped in sin.
[time=2985] Break our hearts for what breaks yours, the song says.
[time=2994] So yeah, I'm not going to yell, not going to argue, not going to pick up a sign in March.
[time=3001] We're going to do our best to live out our faith.
[time=3003] We're going to speak the truth in love.
[time=3004] We're going to keep informing the church with the truth of God's word so the church can live out the truth in a way that makes a difference.
[time=3011] Lastly, what about those who are humble?
[time=3015] What about those who are wanting to live in a right, pure relationship with God and struggle with this issue of homosexuality?
[time=3027] I picked up a book about a year ago by a guy named Wesley Hill washed and waiting.
[time=3034] Reflections on Christian faithfulness and homosexuality.
[time=3039] I came to a part, I want to read this to you as we close this morning.
[time=3042] I hope you'll listen closely.
[time=3043] I want to read this to you from the perspective of a brother and I'm choosing my words intentionally here, a brother in Christ I've met Wesley, a brother in Christ who, for whatever reason
[time=3058] we won't get into all the reasons, I'm not trying to dissect that.
[time=3061] This is his thorn, this is his struggle and I want you just to listen to this and obviously this is in the context of his struggle with homosexuality.
[time=3072] You can listen to it with that context.
[time=3074] You know what you could also do is you could just put your struggle in these very words.
[time=3080] I want you to listen.
[time=3082] There was a time he says in my struggle with homosexuality when I felt that the world was caving in on me.
[time=3087] I'd been living in Minneapolis for only a few months and I felt burdened physically so at times by loneliness, confusion and fear and guilt.
[time=3095] During a brief visit back to Wheaton, Illinois where I had graduated from college, I arranged to meet with my good friend Chris and on a cold winter afternoon in Chicago, I told him how I was feeling and asked for his help.
[time=3107] Out of all the things Chris said to me in response that day, one sticks out, with compassion in his voice, he said, origin, the great Christian theologian of the early church believed Wes, that our souls existed with God before we were born.
[time=3128] What if he were right?
[time=3132] This friend goes on to say I don't believe he was but, and I don't either, I don't think, but listen, he says I don't think he's right but what if he was?
[time=3141] Imagine for a moment if he were, imagine yourself, Wes, standing in the presence of God, looking down from heaven on the earthly life you're about to be born into and God says to you, Wesley, I'm going to send you into the world for 60 or 70 or 80 years, it will be hard.
[time=3161] In fact, it will be more painful and confusing and distressing than you can now even imagine, you will have a thorn in your flesh.
[time=3173] For you, a homosexual orientation that is the result of your entering a world that sin and death have broken
[time=3184] beyond what I ever intended and you may wrestle with it all your life, but I will be with you.
[time=3192] But I, God says to him in this imaginary conversation,
[time=3200] but I will be with you, I will be watching every step you take guiding you by my spirit and my words, supplying you with grace efficient for each day and at the end of your journey, Wes, you will see my face again and the joy we share there will be born out of the agonies you faithfully endured by the power I gave you.
[time=3220] And no one will take that joy, that solid resurrection joy away from you.
[time=3227] Wesley, Chris said to me, looking me in the eye, wouldn't you say yes to that journey?
[time=3236] Wouldn't you say yes if God had that conversation with you?
[time=3243] I nodded and Chris's nod grew stronger,
[time=3249] his eyes flashing deep care and concern, but you have had it.
[time=3253] In a sense, God is the author of your story.
[time=3256] He is watching, supplying you with his spirit moment by moment, he will raise your body from the dead someday to live with him at all the great company of the redeem forever and the joy you will have in that moment will be yours for all of eternity.
[time=3272] Can you endure longer knowing that day will come?
[time=3275] Can you keep walking the lonely road of celibacy?
[time=3279] If you remember, he's looking on and delights to help you persevere.
[time=3287] I read this last part to all of you here in the church this morning.
[time=3291] He said, "Your struggle isn't a mindless, unobserved string of random disappointments." I heard Chris say that day.
[time=3301] And faithfulness is never a gamble.
[time=3304] It will always be worth it.
[time=3306] The joy then will be worth the struggle now.
[time=3309] In the end, Wesley Hill writes, "In the end, I think that it's how I am learning to live faithfully and purely as a Christian who struggles with homosexuality." I'm not sure what your struggle is.
[time=3328] For some of you, it's this, for others of you, it's the other things we've already talked about.
[time=3334] I hope and pray that God would give you the strength.
[time=3338] I believe he does to live faithfully and purely.
[time=3344] And rightly, with character and integrity in the midst of whatever your struggle might be.
[time=3351] Would you stand?
[time=3354] And let me just encourage you as you leave today.
[time=3358] There may be questions that you have.
[time=3361] We're inviting you to find us on Twitter, Facebook.
[time=3365] We've got a number that we can make available to you where you can text us.
[time=3370] You can always just write us a letter.
[time=3371] You can call us on the phone.
[time=3373] But Facebook, Twitter, texting, we're gonna just compile your questions over these next four weeks, any question.
[time=3379] Then we're gonna have a panel on the fifth Sunday.
[time=3381] And we're gonna dive into the questions that you've asked along the way and hopefully provide some teaching that will allow the whole five weeks to be something applicable for you in the everyday of life.
[time=3393] Would you pray with us, Father, in heaven?
[time=3394] We stand before you, a people who have been convicted all over again today about our sin.
[time=3402] And I know we've addressed and looked at a certain topic I believe we've needed to, but oh God, may all of us be reminded of our topics.
[time=3411] May we all be reminded of the heinous ugliness of our sin.
[time=3417] And may we all, God, turn to you, to your word, to your spirit, to your people, for the help, encouragement, and guidance that all of them can bring.
[time=3428] And may we be a people who live life set apart.
[time=3433] Regardless of our struggles, may we overcome those struggles through our faith in your son and our commitment to follow him and then live lives that separate us from the world, that show and portray a picture of a people who are possessed by you and your truth, your grace, your forgiveness, and your hope.
[time=3458] Oh God, I pray that your loving and ongoing forgiveness
[time=3464] would ease the pain of guilt that I know so many in the room feel this morning.
[time=3469] Oh God, I pray that your enduring love would strengthen us to face another day.
[time=3474] Oh God, may we face it with all the strength and courage that you can provide.
[time=3478] God allow us to walk these remaining days, whatever these days may entail, however long we may walk, until glory, God, give us the strength to be your people.
[time=3490] In your son's name we pray.
[time=3492] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=3514] (upbeat music)
