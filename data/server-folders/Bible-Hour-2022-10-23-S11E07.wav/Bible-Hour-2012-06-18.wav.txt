[time=61] >> Heard something this week that just kind of packaged what I've known for years.
[time=67] Let me just pass it on to your real quick dads.
[time=69] I hope you'll take notes on this one.
[time=72] I really hope you'll just remember these three words.
[time=75] They're gonna be on the screen right now.
[time=78] Don't forget these three words, prove, lose, hide.
[time=81] Listen guys, if you wanna have a meaningful relationship that goes on and
[time=87] on and on with your kids, they have got to know that there is absolutely,
[time=95] in their relationship with you, there is absolutely nothing to prove.
[time=102] As it relates to your love and your acceptance, the way this thing works is the love of the Father.
[time=109] In heaven gets kind of passed on to our kids through the love of the Father on Earth, and as a Father on Earth, they have to know that as it relates to your love and your acceptance of them, there is absolutely zero that they have to prove.
[time=125] They also have to know this, that there's absolutely nothing with you.
[time=128] As their dad, there's nothing to lose, as it relates to relationship with you.
[time=135] There isn't anything they could do, there's nowhere they could go, there's no choice they could make, there's no struggle they could have that would ever distance you from them.
[time=145] In other words, they've got to know that they're not going to ever lose you.
[time=150] And I know there are difficulties that we face, and I know there are situations even today where you're trying to figure out how to stay close, keep working on it, make sure they know there isn't anything that they could ever do to lose you.
[time=164] They got to know there's nothing to prove, nothing to lose, and this last one's big.
[time=169] They've got to know, for the sake of your relationship with them, them with you and your days ahead, they've got to know there's absolutely nothing to hide.
[time=179] So many kids today, they learned it from you and me.
[time=183] They live in hiddenness.
[time=185] They don't want to say what they're feeling.
[time=188] They don't want to tell you what they're thinking, and they certainly at times don't want to say to you what they've done, because they're afraid.
[time=198] And when you communicate with them the very same thing that's been communicated to you from the Father in heaven, that there isn't anything that can ever Romans says there's nothing that can separate us from the love of God, nothing.
[time=213] And when they understand that in the way that you deal with them, when you're gracious and when you're patient and when you're kind, and when you go out of your
[time=223] way to reinforce your love, it makes a difference in their lives.
[time=229] Nothing to prove, say it with me, nothing to prove, nothing to lose, nothing to hide.
[time=235] Oh, dads, I hope and pray, and the days to come that you will with me keep working
[time=241] on our ability to communicate these things and live out this kind of love, the love of the Father through Father's on earth, to kids here who desperately need to know
[time=252] in sense that we're there.
[time=255] Let's keep singing and worshiping this morning to the Father in heaven about His
[time=261] great love.
[time=262] Let's do that together.
[time=263] How deep the Father's love for us, how vast beyond all knows you, that He should give
[time=284] His only Son to make a wretch His treasure, how great the pain of searing laws, the Father
[time=304] turns His face away as wounds which are the chosen one, bring many sons to glory.
[time=321] Behold the man upon the cross, my sin upon His shoulders, a shame to hear my knocking
[time=351] voice, call out among the scholars, it was my sin that held Him there, until it was
[time=370] accomplished, His dying grip has brought me life.
[time=380] I know that it is finished.
[time=391] I will not boast in anything, no gifts, no power, no wisdom.
[time=408] But I will boast in Jesus Christ, His death and resurrection.
[time=424] I cannot give and answer, but this I know with all my heart, His wounds have made my
[time=448] life.
[time=478] I want you to know that we are in the midst of a series that we have entitled Untouchables.
[time=489] These are issues that the Church oftentimes in the past has stayed away from.
[time=495] These are issues that oftentimes in the past the Church has chosen not to address, almost
[time=501] as if they were untouchable.
[time=502] But the fact is that these issues are issues that God's word speaks to, and we as believers have to have an understanding.
[time=510] As you watch week after week over these next several weeks, last week we touched on homosexuality, today you are going to hear a message on justice issues, things such as racism or AIDS or homelessness
[time=523] and poverty.
[time=525] As you listen next week, politics, we want you to ask your questions, we want you to
[time=531] make your statements, we want to interact with you on these things.
[time=535] So please, at the bottom of the screen here you see our Twitter account address, you see
[time=541] our Facebook address, there's a texting number, you can just text us a question or two or a
[time=547] thought or a comment, we would love to hear from you.
[time=550] And if you don't Twitter, Facebook or text and you want to give us a call, you can do that or you can email me at the email address shown at the bottom of the page.
[time=559] Hey, we're really thankful for you and this is a way that we want to reach out to you and make sure you know that your heart, your life, your journey means a lot to us.
[time=568] So let us hear from you as we make our way through this series.
[time=572] God bless you.
[time=573] I hope you have a great week and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=593] King to rescue the weak and the poor, King to serve and not be served.
[time=614] We will give, we must go, live to feed the hungry, stand beside the broken.
[time=634] We must go, stepping forward, keep us from just singing.
[time=643] We must go, we must go, we must go, we must go, we must go, we must go, we must go, we
[time=669] must go, we must go.
[time=693] Thanks Corbin, we're going to sing that song after we're in God's word this morning, I
[time=699] can't wait to sing it with you.
[time=701] My name is Steve Webster, I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, I get to teach at the school, but not in June or July, happy to say, doesn't it feel like I'm on break
[time=712] that we've been pretty busy, it's good, it's very, very good.
[time=716] We're going to be in Isaiah chapter 1 this morning as our hub passage, if you want to go there, Isaiah is before Jeremiah, so go to Jeremiah and turn left and you'll find
[time=727] Isaiah, it's a big book, 66 chapters, we'll be in the first one.
[time=732] I was struck by a couple of things this morning as Corbin was praying and as Kelly was sharing
[time=739] earlier, I was struck that when Jesus taught his disciples to pray, what were the first
[time=745] two words of the prayer that he taught to the disciples, our father, our Catholic neighbors,
[time=751] call that prayer, the our father.
[time=754] So how appropriate that on Father's day we should think of God as a father, it's the way that Jesus described his father to the disciples.
[time=763] He used a collective pronoun, our father, that's amazing.
[time=768] And on Father's day I was also struck by what Kelly said with regard to our kids not having anything to prove, nothing to lose, nothing to hide.
[time=777] My daughter had her first swim meet yesterday.
[time=780] So we brought London to Fort Wayne, 25 meter backstroke.
[time=785] She won her little heat and I went over to the tent where all the kids were, were gathered
[time=791] with 400,000 people at the swim meet yesterday, it's just like all Fort Wayne was there.
[time=796] I got my nine year old daughter hand, I took her face in my hands, I said, honey I love you, I don't love you anymore because you won.
[time=805] The fact that you won this race doesn't make me love you anymore if you got first place or sixth place.
[time=810] I got her a pore card a few weeks ago and it was filled with age, she's like your mother, she's very very responsible, very diligent daughter.
[time=819] I don't love Hannah anymore because your pore card is filled with age and you shouldn't love your kids more either.
[time=825] I want, we want them to do well, but if they are in any way, dear friends, on Father's Day, men, if, if your kids have any sense that your affection for them is tied to their
[time=837] performance, then I just pray that God would lead you to a place of repentance over that.
[time=842] Guys, not how God looks at you, if you are his child and aren't you glad, are you glad
[time=849] about that this morning?
[time=850] Okay.
[time=851] Because my performance leaves much to be desired.
[time=856] I just got back on Friday from a week at Wheaton College where I've mentioned that to you before here on Sunday morning.
[time=861] I go over, it's my sixth time going, it's incredible to be filled up during those five
[time=867] days away.
[time=869] About 10 years ago, we were at Wheaton College doing some studies there, about 10 years ago I was walking through the park, a beautiful park in downtown Wheaton and I met a man in
[time=879] the park who had to have been 450, 500 pounds and he had him be $5 bill and he said, "Could you please go buy me a sandwich?" I said, "Of course I'll go buy you a sandwich." So I went and got a sandwich and I came back and I gave it to him and I began to talk to him about his life.
[time=895] He had a white plastic bucket filled up with medication for his, he had a very serious heart condition.
[time=902] And so I was in school, we didn't have much money and so I just began to try to find ways to help this man who had nobody to speak for him.
[time=910] He was homeless, he was living in the park, he was in trouble, he was laboring, breathing.
[time=916] And so I began to call churches in the area asking if they could help out and I called one after the other including the church where I was attending, a very big, very well-known, very faithful church and every one of the churches that I called said, "Have you called social services to help?
[time=933] Have you called social services to help?
[time=935] Half a dozen times I did this.
[time=937] The large, thriving, evangelical churches all across the West Chicago area and every one
[time=943] of them said, "It's not my job, it's the government's job." And my heart broke for this man who had no one to speak for him.
[time=953] And so I put him in a hotel room that night because I could not leave him in the park.
[time=958] I took him to his doctor's appointment later in the week and eventually got him to a homeless shelter later on.
[time=963] I tell you that story in no way to make much of my poor efforts on his behalf but to illustrate
[time=970] that in that respect the church failed him because they had nothing to say, nothing to
[time=976] give to this man.
[time=978] We had commencement services here at Blackhawk just a couple of weeks ago and on our way out a woman approached my wife, Jody, and asked if she could have some money for gas because her husband had a job in Warsaw, he'd be out of work for a long time, could have some gas money.
[time=993] So I came out shortly after Jody and we spoke for a while and she followed us at the gas station at a folder car with gas.
[time=998] I'm in a man downtown a couple of years ago and he goes, "Cost some money."
[time=1004] I said, "Yeah, what would you like money for?" I want a sandwich.
[time=1009] So what kind of sandwich do you want?
[time=1010] I'll get you anything you want.
[time=1011] I told some money.
[time=1012] No, we don't have a sandwich, I'll get you anything you want.
[time=1017] You name it.
[time=1018] I'll get you two sandwiches.
[time=1019] What kind of sandwich do you want?
[time=1020] I'll get you two of them.
[time=1021] No, I'm asking some money.
[time=1022] I'll get you a sandwich, just tell me and you walk the way.
[time=1026] So you see friends, there's a need to be discerning in all of this.
[time=1033] How many of you have seen a person in Fort Wayne in 2012 with a sign asking for help?
[time=1040] Raise your hand if you've seen a person with a sign.
[time=1042] Almost all of you, they're everywhere.
[time=1044] What do we do?
[time=1045] What's our response?
[time=1047] I don't know.
[time=1048] I'll tell you this one more story as we get started.
[time=1053] I was in Wheaton last week doing my sermon preparation from a Starbucks, which is a pretty good place to do sermon preparation.
[time=1059] If I highly recommend it, I ever have a chance.
[time=1062] It didn't have wireless access most of the week and so I got to just kind of live there for a couple of hours every day just doing some reading and some preparing.
[time=1072] And on Friday morning as I was leaving to go out of town, I met this man named Don.
[time=1078] Don was sitting at a table sleeping.
[time=1080] We're out to the Starbucks in downtown Wheaton where I was preparing this sermon about justice all week and there he was.
[time=1088] I said, "Hey, what's your name?" Don?
[time=1091] I said, "Don, what can I do for you?" I showed up a cup of coffee and I had a little sample cup.
[time=1099] They'd give him an inside and so I went inside and bought him a cup of coffee.
[time=1104] So here we go, Don.
[time=1106] God bless you.
[time=1107] Can I pray with you?
[time=1109] Now, if I had seen Don and Don asked him, "What do you need, Don?"
[time=1115] And he had a cup of coffee.
[time=1116] If I had said to Don, "You know what, Don?
[time=1118] You need Jesus, not a cup of coffee." That's true, but I don't think Don would have wanted to pray with me at that point.
[time=1129] So, friends, we have this.
[time=1131] It's everywhere Don was there so I could tell you his story.
[time=1136] Don is a person.
[time=1138] Don has a name.
[time=1141] Don matters to God and I don't know how he got on the streets of Wheaton, but that's not my responsibility.
[time=1146] I don't know what poor choice is Don has made to bring him to that place where he has
[time=1152] nowhere to live in a place as affluent as that.
[time=1155] I don't know.
[time=1159] This morning, we are going to be in Isaiah chapter 1.
[time=1163] I want to go there with you, friends, this morning to illustrate the heart of God on this issue of justice and I'll define justice with you in just a minute.
[time=1171] Before I begin, I want to pray.
[time=1175] And before I pray, I just have to say, this morning, I've never been prouder to serve in this place that I am today.
[time=1181] All the things that are going on, I can't wait to tell you about them.
[time=1183] I can't wait to tell you these stories.
[time=1185] I can't wait to open God's Word with you.
[time=1186] I am so proud to be a part of Blackhawk Ministries and the voice it seeks to be in this community
[time=1193] in the world for the Lord.
[time=1196] Would you pray with me as we start?
[time=1201] Please.
[time=1205] Father, we have all seen, whether this year or not, we've all seen people holding signs.
[time=1214] And none of us probably know how they got there.
[time=1217] And it's complicated.
[time=1218] We're busy people and we have lives and how to help is not always easy.
[time=1226] Whether to help is not optional.
[time=1228] We are called to help.
[time=1229] How is hard?
[time=1231] Help us to know, Father.
[time=1232] Help us to be soft-hearted people this morning as we hear what your Word says.
[time=1238] I pray, Lord, this morning that your Word would afflict the comfortable among us and it would comfort the afflicted.
[time=1244] I do thank you, God, for what's going on in this place.
[time=1246] I thank you for the evidences of your Holy Spirit everywhere I go and the desire to help
[time=1253] those who are broken and who are hurting and who are lonely.
[time=1257] I ask all these things in Jesus' name.
[time=1261] [AMEN] In a book of his sermons, Phillips Brooks said this, "Never let the seeming worthlessness
[time=1268] of sympathy make you keep back that sympathy of which when men are suffering around you,
[time=1277] your heart is full.
[time=1278] You want to help them.
[time=1280] Go and give it without asking yourself whether it's worth the while to give it.
[time=1286] It is too sacred a thing for you to tell what it is worth.
[time=1291] God from whom it comes sends it through you to his needy child.
[time=1296] We are his ministers of reconciliation from a couple of weeks ago.
[time=1299] We still are today.
[time=1301] And reconciliation takes many forms.
[time=1303] The form that Paul's talking about in that chapter is reconciliation with God.
[time=1309] But dear friends, this morning, I pray that we would see this issue of justice through the right lenses, the lenses that God has given us of his Word, justice.
[time=1319] There is not one in your bulletin if you'd like to follow along, we'll be using that to help us navigate Isaiah chapter 1.
[time=1326] Justice is the Hebrew word, Mishpat, I think Tony Opelger has been with us in recent years,
[time=1332] helping us understand that word.
[time=1333] And it means, as it's used in the Bible this way, it means to treat people equitably.
[time=1340] I saw Don Sealy this morning before I came in and he said he wants someone to be dealt with with justice in his life.
[time=1346] Can you give it to him, Steve?
[time=1350] And he was joking, of course.
[time=1352] He really wants justice.
[time=1355] I don't think I want God to deal justly with me.
[time=1357] I'll only think about it for a minute.
[time=1361] I don't want God to give me what I deserve.
[time=1366] I'm grateful that that's been visited upon his son and not me because without that we are without hope in the world.
[time=1373] It means acquitting or punishing every person on the merits of the case regardless of race or social status.
[time=1379] And here's the heart of it, I think, friends.
[time=1382] This consists in finding out a certain thing, said GK Chesterton.
[time=1387] It's finding out a certain thing due to a certain man and giving it to him.
[time=1393] That's the heart of it.
[time=1394] In a book called Heretics, that's what he said.
[time=1396] It consists in finding out a certain thing, do a certain man and giving it to him.
[time=1402] Giving people what they're due.
[time=1404] Punishment, protection, care, that's justice.
[time=1408] What they are due.
[time=1409] Why are they do it?
[time=1411] Why do they deserve equitable, fair treatment?
[time=1415] Why do all of us deserve that?
[time=1417] We'll get there.
[time=1418] I am highly indebted to this book by Tim Keller.
[time=1421] Tim Keller is a pastor in Manhattan and is an incredibly important voice in God's kingdom.
[time=1429] I want to read you a couple of quotes from the book this morning as we get started.
[time=1432] The book is called Generous Justice.
[time=1435] I don't think I've been encouraged by anything on this issue as much as I have this.
[time=1439] The subtitle is, How God's Grace Makes Us Just.
[time=1443] What a great title, Generous Justice.
[time=1447] He says this, "There are valid reasons why many become concerned when they hear Christians talk about doing justice.
[time=1455] Often that term is a slogan being used to recruit others to jump on some political bandwagon.
[time=1459] Nevertheless, if you are trying to live a life in accordance with the Bible, the concept and call to justice are inescapable." I repeat.
[time=1477] We do justice when we give all human beings their due as creations of God.
[time=1484] Doing justice includes not only the writing of wrongs, but generosity and social concern,
[time=1490] especially toward the poor and vulnerable.
[time=1493] This kind of life reflects the character of God.
[time=1495] It consists of a broad range of activities, from simple, fair and honest dealings with people in daily life, to regular, radically generous giving of your time and resources,
[time=1505] to activism that seeks to end particular forms of injustice, violence, and oppression.
[time=1513] He refers to in the book the quartet of the vulnerable in the Old Testament as widows,
[time=1520] orphans, immigrants, and the poor.
[time=1522] Whenever you hear about justice in the Old Testament, those four people, those four kinds of folks always come up.
[time=1529] Today you might hear different words, refugees, migrant workers, AIDS victims, the homeless,
[time=1537] single parents, the elderly, people who cannot fend for themselves.
[time=1544] What is our response?
[time=1545] The justice of a society says the Lord, and Isaiah 1 is measured on how it treats those people.
[time=1551] Let's say that again.
[time=1553] The justice of a society is measured on how it treats the most vulnerable people among
[time=1559] it.
[time=1560] I don't know why there are thousands of Burmese refugees in Fort Wayne, but there are.
[time=1565] Did you know that?
[time=1568] By the thousands here in Fort Wayne, the harvest, the fields are white, my friends, and as the
[time=1577] morning proceeds, you'll see exactly how white they are of needs that we can help to meet.
[time=1583] I cannot wait to keep talking with you about it.
[time=1585] Let's look at Isaiah chapter 1 this morning.
[time=1587] Would you stand with me as we read this together?
[time=1592] We'll start in verse 12 and read down to verse 17.
[time=1595] Isaiah chapter 1 verses 12 through 17.
[time=1599] Verse 12 is God asking a rhetorical question.
[time=1601] It's a question that needs no answer because the answer is obvious.
[time=1605] Isaiah 1 verse 12, "When you come to appear before me, who has required of you this trampling of my courts, bring no more vain offerings.
[time=1615] Incense is an abomination to me.
[time=1618] New moon and Sabbath and the calling of convocations.
[time=1622] I can't endure iniquity, sin, and solemn assembly.
[time=1626] Your new moons and your appointed feasts says the Lord, my soul hates."
[time=1634] And they become a burden to me.
[time=1636] I am weary of bearing them.
[time=1638] When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you.
[time=1645] Even though you make many prayers, I will not listen.
[time=1650] Your hands are full of blood, wash yourselves, make yourselves clean, remove the evil of
[time=1656] your deeds from before my eyes, cease to do evil, learn to do good, seek justice, correct
[time=1664] oppression, bring justice to the Fatherless, plead the widows' cause.
[time=1669] You may be seated.
[time=1671] There is an outline in your bulletins if you'd like to follow along.
[time=1675] Roman numeral one in that outline is God's assessment and it is a bleak assessment.
[time=1681] We're going to read through some more of Isaiah 1 as the outline suggests, but that's a good start.
[time=1687] At the heart of God's indictment against these people is there's no justice.
[time=1692] At the heart of it, it isn't something on the outside kind of orbiting around it.
[time=1696] It's right in the middle and God is unhappy.
[time=1700] It's hard to imagine stronger language friends from God than this language.
[time=1704] He says that he hates when they get together and they do all of this religious things.
[time=1709] He hates it.
[time=1711] He says he won't listen to their prayers.
[time=1713] Why?
[time=1716] Because the needy and the powerless among them are not being cared for.
[time=1720] That's why.
[time=1722] More to come on that.
[time=1724] So that's letter A, that's the problem.
[time=1727] That's the problem.
[time=1728] There is an alarming breakdown here between what's claimed to be believed and what is
[time=1734] actually done.
[time=1737] John Giroge, a Kenyan apologist I talked with last week at the conference where I was attending, said this, "Whatever your mind rejects will be reflected in your life no matter how close you hold it in your heart.
[time=1749] You can't fake it.
[time=1750] What you think up here is going to show itself.
[time=1753] You might have come into church and be devoted and raise your hands and say amen."
[time=1759] What does your life actually show?
[time=1761] That's the mark.
[time=1764] The unbelieving world as you know is scandalized by that breakdown between what we say we believe
[time=1770] and what we actually do.
[time=1772] They're watching us friends.
[time=1773] They're watching black cock ministries on television to be sure, but more than just that.
[time=1781] When you self-identify as a follower of Christ and each say where you go to church they're watching what we're doing.
[time=1786] They hear what we say.
[time=1787] They're hearing it right now perhaps.
[time=1790] But they watch what we do even more closely.
[time=1795] And tragically in Isaiah 1, God will not hear the prayers of these people because they are not accompanied by Godly lives.
[time=1802] I will repeat that.
[time=1804] God does not hear the prayers of these people because they are not accompanied by Godly lives.
[time=1809] That's a warning.
[time=1811] Plain and simple.
[time=1812] The people of Israel know all about the sacrificial laws and the systems and they keep it down to the letter.
[time=1817] But when it comes to helping the powerless among them, nothing is there.
[time=1822] The word fatherless on Father's Day, how appropriate.
[time=1826] The word fatherless shows up 11 times in Deuteronomy.
[time=1830] The last will and testament of Moses for the people of Israel going to the land of promise.
[time=1836] What's at the heart of what God wants for us?
[time=1839] What's right there in the middle?
[time=1841] I suggest to you from the Word of God and on its authority that this issue is not something that if we get around to it, it's right at the center.
[time=1851] Caleb and alerts Mitchell's ministry and you hope Uganda is entirely centered around this
[time=1858] issue of fatherlessness, bringing the fatherhood of God to the fatherless.
[time=1863] And they have chosen as their verses Psalm 68 verses 5 and 6, they will not be on the screen.
[time=1869] Listen as I read them with you.
[time=1870] Psalm 68 verses 5 and 6.
[time=1873] Father of the fatherless and protector of widows is God in His holy habitation.
[time=1880] God settles the solitary in a home.
[time=1882] He leads out the prisoners to prosperity, the rebellious dwell in a parched land.
[time=1889] Matters to God, orphans matter to God.
[time=1894] He self identifies as a father in the scriptures everywhere, especially to those that don't
[time=1900] have any fathers.
[time=1904] Anyone can perform rituals, but the person who acts like God is the person who has entered into a life-changing relationship with him, which is what God wants.
[time=1913] John A.T. Robinson in a book called Honest to God said this, this is very, very convicting.
[time=1922] The test of worship is how far it makes us more sensitive to the beyond in our midst,
[time=1929] to the Christ in the hungry, the naked, the homeless, and the prisoner.
[time=1937] Did you -- were you here for Blockek on the run this morning?
[time=1940] There's an opportunity for you to be a blessing to prisoners during the lobby, build glass.
[time=1950] God's at work, friends.
[time=1951] He wants us to be involved in these things.
[time=1954] Only if we are more likely to recognize him there after attending an act of worship like this, is that worship Christian rather than a piece of religiosity in Christian dress?
[time=1968] We're just playing at it.
[time=1969] If we're actually worshiping Christ together, it will be shown by what you do after the service, maybe in the lobby.
[time=1978] With our own children in children's ministries, in a backyard Bible camp, to prisoners, world
[time=1985] vision.
[time=1988] Has it impacted you, friends, at all, that there are thousands of children that will die today in the 21st century because they had nothing to eat or drink?
[time=2002] Has that impacted you in your heart, truly?
[time=2005] We can do something about it.
[time=2007] We can do something.
[time=2008] Don't think necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
[time=2015] We can do something, and even if it's meager, it's something.
[time=2021] I'm going to run, Eric Emily got me.
[time=2023] I'm going to run four miles for world vision in September.
[time=2026] I got some time to get ready for that.
[time=2030] Four miles is not too much to ask so a child can have water for a year.
[time=2035] Is it?
[time=2039] I don't think so.
[time=2040] Obviously not.
[time=2041] I don't want to insult you by asking again.
[time=2043] Are we so nervous about earning our salvation that it's turned into no works at all?
[time=2051] Has the pendulum swung that far or the other direction?
[time=2054] Go to Ephesians chapter 2.
[time=2057] I had a gentleman taking here after the first service.
[time=2060] I'm so grateful that he did.
[time=2061] Go to Ephesians chapter 2.
[time=2064] These are familiar verses to you.
[time=2065] I want you to watch the progression here.
[time=2067] Ephesians chapter 2, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Go, eat popcorn.
[time=2071] Ephesians chapter 2, verse 8, this will not be in the screens either.
[time=2080] These are very familiar verses to us, but keep reading with me.
[time=2083] Listen, for a bright grace, Ephesians 2, 8, you have been saved through faith and this is not your own doing.
[time=2090] It's the gift of God.
[time=2091] Not a result of works that no one may boast.
[time=2094] We, verse 10, we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus 4.
[time=2102] Good works which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.
[time=2106] There is no distinction between God's grace saving us through faith and that we are His workmanship, His masterpiece created for good works.
[time=2117] We have separated those two things out and I know why we've done it because the reformers
[time=2124] were right to have nervousness about the fact that we cannot earn our salvation.
[time=2128] But Paul says very plainly that the demonstration that God's grace has saved us through faith
[time=2135] is works.
[time=2137] We'll go to James 2 in a few minutes.
[time=2142] John Selden said this, "It was an unhappy division that has been made between faith and
[time=2148] works.
[time=2149] Though in my intellect I may divide them, like with the candle, there is light and heat,
[time=2156] but put out the candle and they're both gone."
[time=2163] Richard Stearns, the president of World Vision, said this, "In today's world, racked by terrorism,
[time=2172] poverty, lawlessness, disease and violence, the message of the gospel and the need for Christians who put their faith into action has never been more acute.
[time=2182] We the followers of Jesus Christ are an integral part of God's plan for the world, the same world that God loves so much that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life.
[time=2195] In this famous verse we see the depth of God's love for our world.
[time=2199] It was not a passive and sentimental love, but rather a dynamic, active and sacrificial
[time=2206] love for God so loved the world that He acted.
[time=2211] There is no distinction between faith and works.
[time=2214] James chapter 2 verses 14 through 26.
[time=2216] Would you go there please?
[time=2217] James is at the very end of the New Testament, right?
[time=2220] After Hebrews, James chapter 2 verses 14 through 26.
[time=2230] I think James sums it up very nicely.
[time=2234] What good is it my brothers, James 2 14?
[time=2236] If someone says they have faith, it doesn't have works.
[time=2238] Can that faith save Him?
[time=2241] If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled." Without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that?
[time=2251] People also have faith by itself if it doesn't have works is dead.
[time=2265] We have, as a church friends, we have to preach the whole council of God.
[time=2270] The whole council of God is Ephesians 2, 8, 9 and 10.
[time=2276] We are saved by grace through faith.
[time=2278] We are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works.
[time=2284] Let me tie a bow on this.
[time=2285] We have the problem.
[time=2287] The problem is disastrous.
[time=2289] Let her be, we also have a solution that's pretty glorious.
[time=2293] Let me say this, liberation from disease, poverty, hunger, thirst is noble, and it's
[time=2300] very much in line with what God wants in the scriptures.
[time=2304] Just meeting those needs, James said, meeting those needs might be the way that we can actually share the gospel with people.
[time=2311] Like Don, outside Starbucks, without those works, no gospel proclamation will be possible.
[time=2323] Don is worth it.
[time=2330] His passage in Isaiah chapter 1, "As an overwhelming display of divine self-revelation, God's showing Himself to us.
[time=2336] What am I like?
[time=2338] He wants to be known, to be found, to be seen.
[time=2340] And here He is.
[time=2341] And He's angry.
[time=2342] He's really angry.
[time=2344] I hate those things among you.
[time=2347] You should know better.
[time=2349] Problem and solution.
[time=2350] What's the solution?
[time=2351] Verse 16, "Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean, remove the evil of your deeds before my eyes.
[time=2356] Seize to do evil, learn to do good, seek justice, correct oppression, bring justice
[time=2364] to the Fatherless." That in the NIV, in the NAS and other translation that says in front of you, it says, "Defend,
[time=2372] defend the Fatherless." What does that mean?
[time=2375] It means there's injustice, and here's the helpless, and you stand in the middle.
[time=2379] You stand in the way of injustice, in the way of things that make them less human.
[time=2388] Hunger, thirst, poverty, all of those things.
[time=2393] I was talking with Jesse Handy yesterday about this.
[time=2396] He's dead right.
[time=2399] Jesus was referred to as a glutton and a drunker because he hung out with those kinds of people.
[time=2407] In other words, friends, he was willing to be misunderstood.
[time=2411] I wonder if we're nervous about giving money to people who might use it for unseemly ends
[time=2420] if we're nervous about it, and so we play God.
[time=2423] You don't deserve it.
[time=2427] You're right.
[time=2428] They don't, and neither did I.
[time=2430] Deserve God's grace, none of us do.
[time=2433] Friends, are you willing to be made a fool of?
[time=2436] To be gracious to someone?
[time=2437] You don't know what that act of kindness might do for somebody.
[time=2440] You don't have any idea.
[time=2441] Neither do I.
[time=2442] Is there a need to be wise and discerning?
[time=2443] Absolutely yes.
[time=2444] I gave you a couple of examples.
[time=2448] But don't close your heart to the needy because you might know better, or I know what they're about.
[time=2453] That's not what God calls you to.
[time=2455] If the needy are right in front of you, what will you do about it?
[time=2459] Are you willing to be made foolish for the case of Christ, acting in obedience?
[time=2465] Are you willing to do that?
[time=2467] Be wise, certainly.
[time=2468] Wise is serpent, sin is sin is doves.
[time=2470] Jesus said, "Christianity today, about three years ago, said this, and I'm hugely encouraged
[time=2481] by this." None of these good works, AIDS research, relief of hunger, poverty or eliminating malaria
[time=2489] or tuberculosis, nay, great works.
[time=2492] They deal with the most, none of them deal with the most profound social problem facing humankind.
[time=2497] That social problem is alienation from God.
[time=2501] And so if our church was 1,500 times more active in our community, I hope we are feeding
[time=2509] people who are hungry and giving so to the homeless, I hope we are.
[time=2514] And that work is not a company with a gospel proclamation, we are failing people.
[time=2521] We're failing people.
[time=2522] That's the most pressing need, but they're not mutually exclusive.
[time=2525] Either feed someone or give them the gospel.
[time=2527] Do both.
[time=2529] Doing one might lead to the other.
[time=2531] That's what James seems to say.
[time=2533] I spoke in chapel a couple years ago about how our students navigate, I think I call it navigating Facebook and older folks among us, I don't know how you feel about it.
[time=2544] But I think we should have empathy for our teenagers who live in a world where their thoughts can be portrayed at any moment, at any given time.
[time=2553] Do you pray for them or you just wag your finger?
[time=2556] You shouldn't do that.
[time=2557] Well, yeah, of course they shouldn't, but you didn't have that opportunity and I'm glad that I didn't because I was mad at my coach and I would have told him about it on Facebook.
[time=2567] I had fights with my parents who are here today, sorry mom and dad.
[time=2572] I'm grateful I didn't have that vehicle to vent my anger inappropriately, but you know what I told them in chapel.
[time=2579] The answer isn't stop posting those pictures on Facebook that are inappropriate.
[time=2585] The answer is get your heart right with Jesus and then what flows out of that heart, what looks so nasty.
[time=2593] Stop treating symptoms and start dealing with problems.
[time=2595] So how do I treat the symptoms of poverty are all around us everywhere?
[time=2598] That's a harder question to above my pay grade, admittedly.
[time=2603] What's my point?
[time=2604] One is that we cannot simply be one handed.
[time=2607] Here's some water.
[time=2608] Good luck with all that.
[time=2610] Here's the gospel.
[time=2611] Good luck.
[time=2613] Find some water.
[time=2614] No.
[time=2615] We can do both.
[time=2616] There are concrete ways to do both.
[time=2619] I am so grateful that our church has been involved.
[time=2621] I told you I was proud to be here.
[time=2622] I am.
[time=2624] We have been active and faithfully, wisely doing benevolent ministry in this place for years.
[time=2630] It's called divine ministry.
[time=2631] I'm so grateful for Mark Arens and his work to head that up.
[time=2633] I'm grateful for a church that treasures and values people in their time of need to pay bills they can't pay.
[time=2641] Grateful for that.
[time=2642] God's evaluation, Romanine rule two in your outline, as Isaiah 1 moves on.
[time=2647] God's evaluation of what's going on, it's bleak.
[time=2652] God's evaluation.
[time=2653] We see here great possibility.
[time=2656] Read this with me.
[time=2657] Look at verse 18.
[time=2658] Come now.
[time=2659] Let us reason together.
[time=2661] You may have a note in your Bible that says let's argue this out.
[time=2663] Let's discuss, says the Lord, though your sins are like scarlet, they'll be whitest
[time=2669] snow, though they are red like crimson, they'll become like wool.
[time=2672] You know that winter time is very, very far away, never farther than today feels like.
[time=2679] And when snow falls, it doesn't need to be whitened.
[time=2684] That first snow, it's beautiful, it's pure as the driven snow, the saying goes.
[time=2690] Snow has no need to be whitened, wool here, has no need of whitening.
[time=2696] So what is God promising?
[time=2698] He is promising a whole new nature, not going to scrub out your dirtiness and give you a whole new nature.
[time=2704] That's what Isaiah says in verse 18 from the Lord, that's great possibility.
[time=2710] That's God's offer.
[time=2711] This is God's offer after what he just said.
[time=2715] I hate when you get together and you pray, I hate that.
[time=2719] When you get together and you offer these sacrifices and your heart doesn't mean it, that makes me disgusted, after all that, he says this, get even now we can reason together
[time=2730] and I'll make you whitest snow.
[time=2731] Great possibility friends, but let her be also disastrous consequences.
[time=2737] Look at verses 19 and 20.
[time=2738] If you are willing and obedient, you eat the good of the land, but if you refuse in rebellion, you'll be eaten by the sword, what a terrifying image that is.
[time=2749] God's appropriately high expectations have been woefully undershot.
[time=2755] To whom much is given, my mom used to say, Steve, to whom much is given, much will be expected and she was right and we have been given much.
[time=2764] And God's expectations of us friends are very, very high and it should be high.
[time=2770] This is all Isaiah, I don't have time to go into all of it, but Isaiah is writing of course about Judah and Jerusalem.
[time=2777] Jerusalem says verse 21, the faithful city, the ESV uses a nasty word to describe that
[time=2784] faithful city, it's become a whore, it's a hard word to say.
[time=2790] They have fallen.
[time=2791] If it's this bad in Jerusalem, in other words, it must be really bad other places too.
[time=2796] So we marked by faithfulness, are we marked by justice, righteousness, all these things.
[time=2805] In Matthew 25, I commend that passage to you as well, I'll do you write that down, Matthew 25 verses 31 through 46, Matthew 25 verses 31 through 46, and that passage Christ separates
[time=2817] sheep from goats.
[time=2820] He says that one of the things that shows you to be a sheep or a goat is what you've done with people who are hungry or naked.
[time=2830] When you see the hunger, the naked, did you close them?
[time=2835] As you do that to the least of these, you've done it to me, Jesus says, and so it doesn't mean that if you feed the hungry, you'll go to heaven, that's not what it means.
[time=2841] It means that by that demonstration of your righteousness, you will show yourself to be a sheep.
[time=2847] If you don't, you're not.
[time=2849] That's what it means.
[time=2850] Be careful about that.
[time=2854] These are disastrous consequences, friends.
[time=2856] So again, we have great possibility, letter A, but disastrous consequences.
[time=2862] God evaluates us through these means, and as we conclude this morning quickly, we have
[time=2868] God's response as chapter one ends, God's response.
[time=2874] Letter A, after God's response, is redemption and letter B is repentance.
[time=2879] These are key words, letter A, redemption, letter B, repentance.
[time=2884] He opens this, Isaiah is an epic vision, and he ends this first chapter with the vision
[time=2891] of comfort and warning about the treatment of the poor.
[time=2895] God will faithfully preserve a faithful remnant, watch this, who show themselves to be faithful
[time=2901] through the redeeming work of God, brought about by repentance, demonstrated by verse 27, "Justice," Zion verse 27, "shall be redeemed by justice."
[time=2913] Wow, there is no disconnect between their state before God and their conduct.
[time=2921] In ancient Near East, because they worshiped idols, that had eyes, but couldn't see, had ears, but couldn't hear, had feet, but couldn't walk around, wouldn't matter if you, if your sacrifice to this deft, dumb, mute idol, it wouldn't matter if you meant it, as if you did it or not.
[time=2937] Guess what?
[time=2938] God's not like that.
[time=2939] Can I get an amen?
[time=2942] Somebody.
[time=2943] God's not like a deft, dumb, mute idol.
[time=2945] He knows why you're doing what you're doing.
[time=2948] It sounds familiar from a couple of weeks ago.
[time=2950] He still does, and if my sacrifice is not accompanied by action, by showing up in my
[time=2957] life tomorrow, then it's vain.
[time=2960] It's what we saw in verse 14 and 15, it's vain, meaningless.
[time=2967] May it not be so of us, Father.
[time=2972] I'm so grateful that Willie Smith is here today.
[time=2975] Willie is the community relations coordinator.
[time=2977] Would you stand up, please, Willie?
[time=2979] Great Willie, everybody.
[time=2980] Willie Smith.
[time=2982] Willie is the community relations coordinator at the Wert Rescue Mission in Fort Wayne,
[time=2988] and I would be remiss if I didn't put some kind of flesh to this for you.
[time=2993] I want to show you a video that highlights what the Fort Wayne Rescue Mission does.
[time=2999] Willie is going to be in the lobby after the service.
[time=3002] Would you please go see him?
[time=3004] Would you please go thank him for coming, thank him for his work, and see how you can come alongside and support him?
[time=3010] Watch this video and be encouraged by what's being done in our city on behalf of those who are powerless.
[time=3019] I lost everything I had, so I ended up coming up here, I spent the time between here and
[time=3026] walking the streets.
[time=3027] Behind the scenes, I was just losing myself an addiction.
[time=3032] I started doing drugs at the age of eight.
[time=3035] I started drinking alcohol at the age of nine.
[time=3039] My life was just messed up.
[time=3044] There are many people who would see us primarily as an agency that provides food and immediate
[time=3064] shelter.
[time=3065] And even though we're providing a significant number of bed nights and meals, we have diversified the way we're providing for our community.
[time=3073] And so, through the houses, we are providing a holistic approach to take care of the needs.
[time=3079] The goal of Caris House is basically to create a safe, healthy environment that fosters change.
[time=3085] All of our residents come looking for something better in their lives, and we provide the environment to do that.
[time=3092] The Restoration House is a facility for men, and individuals are able to come to the Restoration
[time=3099] House, and we will offer them a short-term program, as well as an intensive program.
[time=3106] To just expose them to how much God Jesus really loves them, and then eventually to
[time=3112] get them to move past the Restoration House to a graduation point where they're now back in the community, they're leading a productive life.
[time=3119] The Lighthouse is a community anchor.
[time=3122] If you're from the community and your desires of a meal, and you're not able to put food on your table, you're able to come to the Rescue Mission, and through the Lighthouse, we provide three meals a day.
[time=3136] People come to Lighthouse for a number of different things, because of our shelter that we provide for the men.
[time=3141] Of course, we have men coming in who have no place to stay, they're living on the street.
[time=3145] As far as our community goes, again, we're providing food for them, but we're also doing more than that.
[time=3150] They try to meet additional needs that men might have.
[time=3153] Lighthouse is our thrift store, and so we invite individuals to contribute from their resources, anything that a thrift store would need, and from the proceeds, we're able to then support the ministries of the houses.
[time=3166] But at the end of the day, we want to see a person who would understand and appreciate
[time=3172] where they are, take full responsibility for themselves.
[time=3177] We provide the tools to gather in partnership, they do the work, and then we give God the
[time=3183] glory.
[time=3184] I don't mind waking up in the morning that it's okay, I'm starting to really love my life.
[time=3188] No matter what you did in your past, or what you're planning on doing, hit somebody here to sit down and talk to you, somebody here to show you their care.
[time=3196] They really, truly care about everyone, and they show that.
[time=3200] The restoration houses equipped me with the spiritual guidance I need to move on forward
[time=3206] in my life.
[time=3207] If you want to know who you are and who your higher power is, this is the place to come to.
[time=3213] Rescue mission can restore hope, where hope was lost.
[time=3227] Willie's in the lobby.
[time=3229] Go talk to Willie.
[time=3230] Todd Edwards is right here.
[time=3231] He's going to be in the lobby, too, with prison ministries, Bill Glass.
[time=3234] Go talk to Todd.
[time=3235] Andrew Maley is right over here.
[time=3237] Andrew, raise your hand real quick.
[time=3238] Andrew's done work in the past with Saints in the streets in Fort Wayne, homeless ministry.
[time=3242] He goes under bridges.
[time=3246] World Vision, Backyard Bible Club, friends, all these things are ways to flesh out what
[time=3252] I've just been talking about in response.
[time=3255] All of these things.
[time=3256] Would you stand with me as we conclude this morning?
[time=3258] I can't wait to sing this song.
[time=3260] I've been thinking about it all week, God of Justice, sing it with passion, friends, in
[time=3266] light of what you've heard from God's Word.
[time=3275] God of Justice, save you to born, King to rescue the king, the poor, choose to serve
[time=3291] and not be the same.
[time=3298] Jesus, you have called us, freely we've received them, freely we will give the past go, lift
[time=3315] your feet the rock, stand beside the rock, we must go, step in forward, keep us from
[time=3326] just singing, you best into action, we must go, to justice, every day, the mercy it
[time=3345] ever made, walking humbly before you got, you have shown us what you require, freely
