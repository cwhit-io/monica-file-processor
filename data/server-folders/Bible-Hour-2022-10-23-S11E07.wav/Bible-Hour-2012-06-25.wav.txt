[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] [MUSIC - 432 seconds]
[time=468] - God, in heaven, my prayers,
[time=474] my hearts would be holy and undividedly devoted to you and that we would sing only the name of Jesus.
[time=482] [AMEN] You may be seated.
[time=486] (upbeat music)
[time=500] [MUSIC - 192 seconds]
[time=694] [APPLAUSE]
[time=702] Well, what a great song we're just saying.
[time=706] We are the light of the world.
[time=710] That is the theme song, you know, for the Republican National Committee, right?
[time=716] [laughter] Or is it the Democratic National Committee?
[time=724] Or is it Ron Paul and all the disenfranchised independents, I forget?
[time=732] No, no, it's the theme song for the church.
[time=738] And I want to remind you this morning as we come to this issue of politics that you, you are the light of the world.
[time=748] You make the difference.
[time=754] We, as the body of Christ in God's grand design, are those who have been called to bring change,
[time=764] to bring hope, to bring reform, to bring all the things that God wants to bring,
[time=770] not a party, not an organization, an organism called the body of Christ.
[time=774] And that is you.
[time=776] And so this morning, as we jump into this, I just want you to know, we've been thinking about this, we've been talking about this, we've been praying about this, the Christian's approach to government, the Christian's approach to the political system, if you will.
[time=790] So what should, I want to ask you this morning as we start, what should our posture be?
[time=796] What should your posture be? What should mind be?
[time=800] What should our attitude be?
[time=802] How should we speak about politicians?
[time=806] As Christians, as those who name the name of Christ, what should we say on Twitter? What should we say on Facebook?
[time=812] What should we forward on emails about the government?
[time=818] How should we, as followers of Christ, engage in the political discussion of our day?
[time=824] Or, or should we?
[time=830] Wow.
[time=832] Talk about a volatile issue.
[time=834] It seems a growing number of people in the church today are increasingly energized about political issues.
[time=842] What's going on in Washington, D.C.?
[time=844] Political policy.
[time=846] And who should be in charge?
[time=850] Because it is up to us, right?
[time=854] Just testing you there.
[time=858] We'll come, we'll come back to that.
[time=860] Steve Webster would say more on that later.
[time=862] People are passionate about these things.
[time=866] Christians getting more and more passionate and energized.
[time=868] Question for you this morning.
[time=870] What should a fully surrendered follower of Jesus Christ be most passionate about these days?
[time=882] What should a fully surrendered follower of Christ, my friends?
[time=886] Be most energized and passionate about these days.
[time=892] The Christians view of government.
[time=896] It really, it really can get dicey.
[time=900] It can get very, very interesting.
[time=902] I'm a little nervous this morning.
[time=904] I'll admit that a little, not a lot, a little.
[time=908] Right here in this room this morning there are brothers and sisters in Christ who see things
[time=914] differently on this front and feel strongly about those differences.
[time=920] Mostly for reasons I completely understand.
[time=924] And so when I get up and teach on it as we open up God's Word this morning, I know there's the possibility that there may be as we make our way through these 35 minutes or so,
[time=934] there may end up being somewhat of a divide.
[time=940] There's the possibility that some will be thrilled with what gets taught today.
[time=946] And there's the distinct possibility that some might get, we'll just say not thrilled.
[time=952] How's that?
[time=954] How does this happen?
[time=956] How do we get divided politically as Christians?
[time=960] Well, it's actually easy.
[time=962] Let me try to explain it to you real quick in just a couple of minutes.
[time=964] Here's how it gets dicey.
[time=966] Here's how so many of us get so divided on this.
[time=970] It's when as believers we start the conversation.
[time=974] It's when as believers we start to dive into this arena and when we start
[time=980] with our political feelings.
[time=984] And from our own political feelings when we then go to the Bible
[time=990] to find principles and truths that support where we started,
[time=996] our political feelings, when we start with political feelings, go to the Bible and try and find truths that support our political bent,
[time=1006] then we're in trouble.
[time=1010] Because at least here in this place is we've tried to give you encouragement and leadership over the years.
[time=1014] I hope you understand that the way we'd want you to come at this or any issue,
[time=1020] homosexuality, justice issues, singleness next week.
[time=1024] You pick the issue, we've always tried to teach you to start with what?
[time=1028] You start with the Scriptures.
[time=1032] And from the Scriptures then we allow them to inform everything else that we do and all that we believe and all the things that we say.
[time=1042] You do not want to start with your own political bent and somehow come to the Bible to try and then shape your platform, if you will.
[time=1052] It gets interesting, I'll admit it.
[time=1054] You have strong, faithful Republicans oftentimes, for instance,
[time=1062] and they take the biblical issue of life, let's say.
[time=1066] You take the biblical issue of life and the sanctity of it,
[time=1072] and you end up seeing a lot of brothers and sisters on that side of the discussion, if you will, and they push hard, extremely hard against abortion,
[time=1082] the killing of the unborn baby, as they should, I believe.
[time=1086] They say it is, and I say this as well, they say it is God and God alone,
[time=1094] who gives and what takes away.
[time=1098] And that a human life, I've heard him say it for years, I've heard him yell it, I've heard him pray it, I've seen him write it, they're consistent in this message that a human life once conceived should be allowed to live no matter the circumstance.
[time=1116] The sanctity of life, they stand for it.
[time=1118] God and God alone gives and takes away.
[time=1124] And then in their next political breath, at times, they'll support, let's say,
[time=1132] a capital punishment or the death sentence, hooking up a man on death road to a machine that will attach to different parts of his body in order to electrify him to death
[time=1142] while he shakes slobbers and groans.
[time=1148] And if I've said it once, in my lifetime, I've said it a thousand times,
[time=1154] and I'm just being honest with you, I've said this a thousand times, if it took a life, I'm okay with us taking his.
[time=1166] It's interesting.
[time=1170] My mind can't help but go back to some of the unspeakably difficult
[time=1176] and yet meaningful conversations that I got to have with Corbin and Tanya last year as they walked that road, the two of them, they allowed
[time=1186] all of us to walk it with them as well as they were informed about Zoe not having a brain and as they were contemplating how to go forward
[time=1196] as they were contemplating how to live out their faith we would sit and we would talk and talk.
[time=1202] The clear message that they received from Scripture, the clear message they received from wise counsel, the clear message they received from me was that God and God alone
[time=1216] gives and takes away.
[time=1220] And yet in my politics you get me going on certain things and I'm talking out the other side of my mouth, it feels, it seems.
[time=1232] There are faithful democratic brothers and sisters, democrats who hear messages like the one that Steve Webster
[time=1242] gave last week, a tremendous message that Steve gave last week on biblical justice.
[time=1248] For a variety of reasons, many of those brothers and sisters are drawn to the New Testament notion of personally caring for the poor, even going so far as to take it beyond personal care, to the establishing of governmental programs, to do the same.
[time=1262] They're for that, they want that, but then some of them, some of those dear Christian democrats will raise an eyebrow when reminded of the same New Testament's mandate that all men should stop at nothing to provide for their families, no matter what.
[time=1278] It's interesting.
[time=1280] And it can be confusing at times because guess why?
[time=1282] Because while the Bible certainly does speak to all the issues, just mentioned it does not speak to republicans,
[time=1292] the Bible does not speak to democrats, the Bible doesn't speak to federal social programs or the conservative rights action committees, no.
[time=1300] We've really, really jumbled this thing up in some ways and made it very, very difficult for us to navigate.
[time=1308] Let me remind all of you this morning, the Bible is not synonymous with Fox News.
[time=1316] I know that's a heartache for a few of you, but it's true.
[time=1320] The Bible is not altogether synonymous with Fox News, nor does the Bible teach that we should take away all wealth from hardworking gifted people so that it's more fair for everyone else.
[time=1332] It doesn't say that.
[time=1334] There were wealthy people in Jesus's life.
[time=1338] There were wealthy people in the Scriptures.
[time=1340] And the church and Jesus benefited from their generosity.
[time=1346] So all of that brief discussion, I know I opened up a bunch of worms, cans, or however you say that.
[time=1354] All that leads us to really where we want to come this morning.
[time=1356] It's where we came with the issue of homosexuality.
[time=1358] It's where Steve took us with the issue of justice.
[time=1360] It's where we'll go with any issue.
[time=1362] We're not going to start with the issue.
[time=1364] We're going to start with what does the what?
[time=1366] What does the Bible say?
[time=1368] Not what do I believe politically?
[time=1370] Then I'll go to the Bible to support it.
[time=1372] No, we always start with Scripture, so would you please open your thoughts to 1 Timothy, chapter 2, some things I want you to see from the Word of God pertaining to our posture, our approach, our words, the spirit with which we engage in the political
[time=1390] discussion and those in government today.
[time=1392] 1 Timothy, chapter 2, verses 1 to 4.
[time=1396] 1 Timothy 2, 1 to 4.
[time=1398] Now, real quick, before I say that, Paul, writing to Timothy, Timothy's pastoring the church in Ephesus, and Ephesus, I just want you to know, is this political cultural hotbed.
[time=1410] I mean, there are so many things going on in Ephesus politically and governmentally as it relates to these new believers and their efforts to move forward in this new church thing, it was, wow, it was really, really interesting.
[time=1426] So it was imperative that Paul addressed these things.
[time=1428] And so here we go.
[time=1430] It says in 1 Timothy, chapter 2, verses 1 to 4, first of all, then I urge that in treaties and prayers, petitions
[time=1440] and thanksgivings be made.
[time=1444] On behalf of all men, for kings, I want in treaties and prayers and petitions and thanksgiving.
[time=1450] And all who are in authority, in treaties, prayers, petitions and thanksgiving so that we, the church,
[time=1460] may lead a tranquil and quiet life.
[time=1464] In all godliness and dignity, this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires, now pointing back to, just in the text, I want you not to miss this, now he's pointing back to all the kings and those who are in authority.
[time=1482] For God our Savior, who desires all men to be what?
[time=1488] Saved.
[time=1490] And to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=1494] The first thing I want you to notice here, just write this down, pray, pray, pray, pray for those who are in authority over you.
[time=1506] This is the first thing I want you to notice about the posture, the mindset, the spirit of the church, the believer toward those in the political system, in the governmental scene.
[time=1518] Don't criticize, he says, don't criticize, don't malign, don't rally against the only verbal words the Bible tells you to speak
[time=1528] about, let's just go with President Obama, how's that?
[time=1534] The only verbal words the Bible tells you to speak about President Obama
[time=1540] are words of prayerful petition, prayerful petition,
[time=1546] kings and all who are in authority.
[time=1550] Listen, because so many powerful and influential political rulers are hostile to God, they are often the targets
[time=1560] of bitterness and animosity from the church.
[time=1564] But Paul urges believers to pray that these leaders might repent of their sins and embrace the gospel, which meant that
[time=1574] the Ephesians were even to pray for the salvation of the Roman Emperor Nero.
[time=1582] It was interesting a few weeks ago as we were talking about this as a staff, I started talking about it with others outside the staff circle, just getting feedback and stuff, and as I was talking about politics with a guy I bumped into, I was telling him a little bit about where we would be going with this and this idea of praying for and what the Bible says about that, and there's a good guy with good intentions and not a lot of understanding yet, but we're getting there with him, and he just said to me, that's ridiculous.
[time=1610] I know it says it here, but we're dealing, Kelly, we're dealing
[time=1616] with leaders today, we're doing really, really bad things.
[time=1622] So I want to just lovingly remind you, anybody in the room who may be thinking there's some discrepancy here, Nero skinned
[time=1632] Christians alive.
[time=1636] He skinned them.
[time=1638] Nero impaled fathers and husbands, even young teenagers impaled
[time=1646] them with spears and lit them on fire with tar to serve as lights for his garden parties, true stuff.
[time=1654] Nero, the Roman government, in this context that Paul writes in, took believers and threw them into the Colosseum so that lions could gnaw on them and chew on them and kill them and tear them
[time=1668] limb from limb for sport.
[time=1672] So anybody in the room thinking that maybe we've got it tough because we got leaders that are doing really bad things that we're being called to pray for, the Ephesian believers are being called in this context to pray for Nero.
[time=1688] And it's the only verbal thing we see them being called to say.
[time=1696] A tranquil, boy, I love this passage.
[time=1700] It says to pray for them, for kings and all who are in authority.
[time=1706] Look at the text so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life.
[time=1712] What do you think that means?
[time=1714] What's the connection there?
[time=1716] Do you see where he's going?
[time=1718] Let me just read this to you.
[time=1720] A tranquil and quiet life.
[time=1722] Quiet refers to the absence of external disturbances.
[time=1726] A tranquil refers to the absence of internal ones.
[time=1728] You're thinking, are you kidding me?
[time=1730] I'll take that.
[time=1732] The absence of external and internal disturbances, I'm in.
[time=1736] What do I have to do?
[time=1736] Pray for those who are in leadership.
[time=1740] While it remains uncompromising in its commitment to the truth, the church, you and me, we are not to agitate or disrupt
[time=1750] the national life, if you will.
[time=1752] When the church manifests, when you and I articulate love
[time=1758] and goodness to all, and when we pray passionately and energized
[time=1764] for the lost, including rulers, the church may experience a certain
[time=1770] amount of freedom, the text is saying.
[time=1774] Persecution should only be the result of righteous living, not civil disobedience.
[time=1782] A tranquil and quiet life is what God calls us to live
[time=1788] under the authority of those who are ruling.
[time=1794] And then that gets even more convicting.
[time=1796] And I mean that.
[time=1798] This is convicting for me as I stand here in front of you.
[time=1802] And I would guess for many of you it will feel the same as we get to this next part here in the passage.
[time=1806] Look what it says, this whole political discussion, you and I and the way we carry ourselves in it.
[time=1812] He says we're to pray, only verbal thing we do is we pray petitions and thanksgivings so that we can lead a tranquil and quiet life than what's it say.
[time=1820] In all godliness and dignity.
[time=1826] And I just want you to let those two words ring in your head for just a moment.
[time=1830] Just say them to yourself.
[time=1832] Godliness and dignity.
[time=1836] Now add to that little mantra in your head.
[time=1840] Now say political discussion with opposing friend at work.
[time=1846] Godliness and dignity.
[time=1852] Go ahead.
[time=1852] Think about you in the car listening to talk radio.
[time=1858] And say the words godliness and dignity.
[time=1864] This is to be the spirit of the church.
[time=1868] This is to be the mindset of the Christian.
[time=1870] This is to characterize the way in which we conduct ourselves in this conversation.
[time=1876] The on looking world should notice this.
[time=1878] They should see this.
[time=1880] They should observe you in your emails that you forward.
[time=1882] In the texts and the Twitters and the Facebooks.
[time=1886] They should sense us functioning with godliness and dignity and when it comes to the way we respond to politics.
[time=1894] All my friends, the Bible is so clear.
[time=1896] Pray, pray, pray.
[time=1900] Pray for those who lead.
[time=1904] And do it in a way that exemplifies your godliness.
[time=1908] What's godliness?
[time=1908] It's like God.
[time=1912] How would he handle it?
[time=1914] We are in disobedience if we are not praying for those who lead.
[time=1922] What else does the Bible say?
[time=1922] Turn with me if you would to Romans chapter 13.
[time=1926] Would you go there?
[time=1928] Just after the book of Acts before you get to 1 Corinthians.
[time=1930] Go to Romans 13.
[time=1934] And let me read this to you.
[time=1936] What should the posture?
[time=1936] What should the attitude?
[time=1938] What should our spirit be as we as believers engage in the political discussion
[time=1944] as we interact with and talk about those in government?
[time=1948] Every person, Romans 13, 1, every person, so that's you and that's me.
[time=1952] No exception.
[time=1954] Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities.
[time=1960] For there is no authority except from who?
[time=1966] And those authorities which exist are actually established by who?
[time=1974] Say it.
[time=1974] Therefore whoever resists authority, whoever goes against it, whoever speaks against it,
[time=1982] whoever is disrespectful toward it, therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God.
[time=1990] And they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.
[time=1994] This is serious stuff.
[time=1998] For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior but for evil.
[time=2004] Do you want to have no fear of authority?
[time=2006] Do what is good?
[time=2008] And you will have praise from that authority, from the same.
[time=2012] For it is a minister of God to you for good, this authority.
[time=2022] But if you do what is evil, all be afraid, for it does not bear the sword for nothing, for it is a minister of God and a avenger who brings wrath on those who practice evil.
[time=2032] Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath but also for conscious
[time=2038] sake, for because of this you also pay taxes for rulers, our servants of God.
[time=2048] When you are sitting here and you are hearing this and you are going, no they are not.
[time=2052] Kelly, listen to the news.
[time=2056] Look around the world.
[time=2058] I know.
[time=2060] I understand the tension.
[time=2062] I am telling you that this is true, that he is on his throne, that nothing has gotten
[time=2068] by him, that there is a grander, schemin plan that you have no clue about, and that all
[time=2076] rulers, whether they realize it, confess it, admit it, are not our servants of God who
[time=2084] sovereignly oversees your life and mine.
[time=2090] For because of this you pay taxes, dividing themselves is very thing.
[time=2094] Render to all what is due them.
[time=2098] Render to all what is due them, tax to whom taxes do, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.
[time=2106] Now we just have to go back quickly, and I will try and make this quick, but I don't
[time=2112] want you to miss verses one and two, just go back to one and two real quick.
[time=2114] Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities.
[time=2118] For there is not one single authority on the face of the earth, except from God, and those
[time=2128] which exist are established by God, therefore whoever resists this authority has opposed
[time=2136] the ordinance of God.
[time=2136] Oh Church, I hope you hear that, I hope you take that in, I hope you receive that as
[time=2142] wisdom today.
[time=2142] So live in submission to our president, live in submission to our mayor, live in submission
[time=2148] to your congressman, live in submission to your coach, live in submission to your boss,
[time=2154] live in submission to your teacher.
[time=2156] For goodness sake, live in submission to the guy who is the president of your homeowners association.
[time=2160] I don't care, anybody who has any role of authority over you in any way, it's an amazing thought,
[time=2168] God put them there.
[time=2172] Think about it, just for a moment, every single authority in your life and mine, nobody in
[time=2180] the world who's ever over you got there without God allowing it.
[time=2188] I remember after the last presidential election, it's at 2008, we all remember it pretty well,
[time=2198] I think that was a huge deal, that was a huge deal wasn't it?
[time=2202] There was a lot going on in culture, there was a lot going on with that deal as it related
[time=2208] to the church, there was a lot of talk, there was a lot of worry, there was a lot of fear, there was a lot of opinion, there was a lot of debate 2008.
[time=2218] We all know how that went and I'll never forget a couple weeks later, a dear woman came down the aisle here, we were down here in the front afterwards and she came up to me literally tears in her eyes and with respect to and reference to the election, she just looked at me and she said how, she was angry and she was scared and she said how in the world
[time=2238] could this have happened?
[time=2244] And I said, God, she said what do you mean?
[time=2252] And so we just had a chance to just talk about this, this was no surprise, this was no shock, this wasn't the end of anything, this was simply what God had as God's word
[time=2263] says, this is what God had allowed.
[time=2268] I think about how he's done that in the past.
[time=2274] While I think he cares about it, I think he cares about other things, much, much more so.
[time=2280] I think about Daniel, we've told you the story about Daniel, we've studied Daniel before, I think about Daniel, I think about a 13, 14-year-old boy who gets kidnapped by some
[time=2291] crazy, maniacal dictator, a murderer, a crazy man, Nebuchadnezzar who takes him to Babylon,
[time=2299] 1500 miles away from his home and his mom and dad who raised him well, I might add.
[time=2306] And I think about how could this happen and whoa, where's God on the throne when a 14-year-old
[time=2312] kid gets kidnapped, so he comes over to Babylon and they say, you know what young man, you're in prison, we're going to change your name, we're going to re-educate you, we're going
[time=2322] to feed you a different menu and we're going to give you a whole different purpose in life.
[time=2326] And he says, well hey, you know what, I'm good with all that except the food thing because I'm not going to do the food thing, I'm just going to, God says and my parents taught me and there's this menu if you will, that me being a Jewish boy, I'm just going to eat this and you can change my name and you can change my education and you can change my
[time=2344] purpose and direction of life, I'll do whatever you say because you're my authority but God
[time=2350] said I got to eat this and so remember what happens, he eats it and God prospers him and
[time=2357] he grows and he grows in favor with Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel 6, you know, they change the law on
[time=2366] them and we'll look at that later and they say he can't pray to God and he keeps praying to God and I'm thinking about Nebuchadnezzar when he, I'm thinking about Nebuchadnezzar
[time=2377] when he realizes all that Daniel had accomplished later in chapter 3, Nebuchadnezzar realizes
[time=2384] the three other young boys, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, they didn't compromise when it came to God's Word and what he had said and at the end of the day, Daniel in Daniel
[time=2396] 6 with the no praying anymore to God, you got to pray to, they threw him in the lion's
[time=2402] den, that didn't work, they threw the three boys in the furnace when they wouldn't bow to the idol, that wouldn't work and if you go to the text you find out in Daniel 3 and
[time=2412] Daniel 6, Nebuchadnezzar and Darius repent, world rulers, world leaders on their knees,
[time=2422] I know it looked scary, I know it looked bad, we know it looked pretty shaky, right?
[time=2431] But at the end of the day as they give themselves to submission where they could and where they stand in great strength where they were supposed to, God does amazing things, listen to this
[time=2441] submit to all, submit to all who are in authority, I love this, God's work people remember this
[time=2447] today, God's work throughout the ages, almost all of God's work has always been done through
[time=2453] God's faithful people, not world rulers, almost all of God's great work has always been done
[time=2461] through God's faithful people, not world rulers, people who were willing to submit to some
[time=2468] world rulers that would in terms of character and mindset, just boggle your mind, listen
[time=2474] to this, governing authorities, when you look at that in the original language and what's being written here, every position of civil authority without regard to competency, morality,
[time=2492] reasonableness or any other caveat, this is what this phrase submission to governing
[time=2501] authorities means, there is no authority except from God since he alone is the sovereign ruler
[time=2507] of the universe, he has instituted four authorities on earth, the government overall citizens,
[time=2514] the church overall believers, parents overall children and employers overall employees and
[time=2520] regardless of reasonableness, regardless of competency, regardless of morality or any
[time=2527] other caveat you want to throw in there, submit to them, he says.
[time=2538] So we're to pray for those who are in leadership and the spirit with which we do that is to
[time=2544] communicate godliness and dignity, we are to submit to them and the only exception given
[time=2552] in scripture on the submission is where I want to take you next, would you go to Acts chapter 5, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, go to Acts 5, 27, here we have Peter and the
[time=2565] apostles in trouble with the government, the government is not happy with them, it's about
[time=2572] to get real dicey and here's why, Acts 5, 27, when they had brought them, they stood them
[time=2578] before the council, the high priest questioned them saying, verse 28, we gave you strict
[time=2585] orders, hey Peter, he says listen, we gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name and what would that name be, the name of who, Jesus, and yet you have filled
[time=2598] Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man's blood upon us but Peter and
[time=2604] the apostles answered, we must obey who, say it church, God rather than who, say it, men,
[time=2612] we must obey God rather than men, there is one clear biblical exception to submission
[time=2618] to government and it's when that government tells you to disobey God, when that government
[time=2626] tells you to disobey God, I do want you to get the flavor of Daniel 6, would you turn
[time=2633] there, we read this first hour, it's just so powerful, I don't think it'll be on the screen but I just want you to see how this works, when you're in a situation submitting
[time=2645] yourself to a governmental or authoritative figure in the political system, in the educational
[time=2652] system at your work I just want you to read this with me and see how it works when you
[time=2658] do it well and then there comes a time when push comes to shove, Daniel 6 verse 4, look
[time=2664] what happens, then the commissioners and say traps began trying to find a ground of accusation
[time=2671] against Daniel in regard to government affairs but they could find no ground of accusation
[time=2678] or evidence of corruption in as much as he was faithful and no negligence or corruption
[time=2685] was to be found in him a believer who was serving an unbelieving king, I just want
[time=2693] you to notice that, spotless in his character and the way in which he gave himself to his
[time=2702] position, these men said we will not find any ground of accusation against this Daniel
[time=2708] unless we find it against him with regard to the law of his God, then these commissioners and say traps came by agreement to the king and spoke to him as follows, King Darius live forever, all the commissioners of the kingdom, the prefects and the say traps and the high
[time=2724] officials and the governors have consulted together that the king should establish a statute and enforce an injunction that anyone who makes a petition a prayer to any God or
[time=2734] man besides you, O King, for 30 days shall be cast into the lion's den.
[time=2741] Now O King established the injunction and signed the document so that it may not be changed
[time=2747] according to the law of the Medes and Persians which may not be revoked, therefore King Darius signed the document that is the injunction, now when Daniel knew that the document was
[time=2759] signed, once he knew that now he was dealing with a biblical mandate, now he was dealing
[time=2766] with something God had commanded, he had served Darius faithfully, flawlessly and yet now
[time=2773] he says no way, nope, even if I have to die, he entered his house now in his roof chamber,
[time=2781] he had windows open towards Jerusalem and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and giving thanks before his God as he had been doing previously and they
[time=2794] came in and they busted him and he went to the lion's den and look at 24, I don't know,
[time=2805] I just, I shouldn't laugh about it, but look at 24, then the king gave orders, they the lion's didn't eat him, God was with him, Darius feels bad, comes to the den the next morning, Daniel's fine, the king gave orders and they brought those men who had maliciously
[time=2819] accused Daniel and they cast them, their children, their wives into the lion's den and they
[time=2825] had not reached the bottom of the den before the lion's overpowered them and crushed all their bones, I guess Darius believed in the death penalty.
[time=2834] And I tell you it says in 26, I make a decree that in all the domain of my kingdom, men
[time=2842] are to fear and tremble before the God of Daniel, do I hear your name in?
[time=2847] For he is the living God and enduring forever, all from the obedience of a faithful young
[time=2856] man.
[time=2857] What does our culture say?
[time=2860] We've seen briefly what the Bible says, what does our culture say?
[time=2864] Our culture, our Christian culture on the issue of politics often says get a bumper sticker.
[time=2874] That's kind of, if you just kind of whittle it all down, a lot of times our Christian cult, not all of our Christian culture, some say get a bumper sticker.
[time=2880] God says, you know what I think God says to us as it relates to this issue, live out the gospel, live graciously, live truthfully, live lovingly, live out the gospel, spread
[time=2893] the message that way.
[time=2897] Culture says we must be passionate about our One Nation under God.
[time=2901] Oh please hear me church, I am, I am so grateful for our nation under God.
[time=2907] I am so thankful for how it was established, I'm so grateful for those who have shed their blood and given their lives for its continued freedom.
[time=2915] I love the country God has allowed me and my family to live in and the rights and privileges
[time=2921] we get because of that, that's true, amen?
[time=2926] Sometimes we get a little, see biblically what we would call America, biblically America
[time=2932] fits into what the Bible would call the kingdoms of this earth.
[time=2937] It's okay and I hope you're energized over your country.
[time=2942] Be more energized about the kingdom of God that the two aren't mutually exclusive but
[time=2953] be more energized, be more passionate about, care more about the kingdom of God going forward.
[time=2962] As you think about in wrestle with this governmental or political discussion, I'm going to ask
[time=2969] Corbin and the team to come up, I want to just remind you of what it says.
[time=2975] In Psalm 121, I was talking with a friend of mine this week, a guy in ministry and he
[time=2981] was having a profound discussion with a pastor from Australia and the pastor from Australia was just simply kind of sharing with my buddy that he had been in the States for a number
[time=2992] of years over time, he had been back and forth between the U.S. and Australia and he said you know I've got an observation, you guys really are involved politically he says to
[time=3004] my friend.
[time=3005] It would never ever be that way in Australia, he says it seems like you all in the church
[time=3012] in America, you seems like you look to Washington DC a lot for your help and yet it says in
[time=3021] Psalm 121, oh where will my help come from, it will come from who, the Lord.
[time=3029] And so I want to just encourage you this morning, I hope we're looking in the right direction for our help and I hope as we engage ourselves in this discussion and as we live out our faith
[time=3040] I hope we can do it in a way that makes a difference, a real difference for the kingdom of God.
[time=3052] No mountain, no valley, no gain or loss we know could keep us from your love.
[time=3067] No sickness, no secret, no chain is strong enough to keep us from your love.
[time=3084] To keep us from your love, how high, how high, no matter where I am, healing is in your
[time=3110] hands, how deep, how strong, now while your grace I stand, healing is in your hands.
[time=3138] Our present, our future, our past is in your hands, we're covered by your blood, we're
[time=3154] covered by your blood, how high, how high, no matter where I am, healing is in your
[time=3180] hands, how deep, how strong, now while your grace I stand, healing is in your hands.
[time=3208] In all things, we know that we are more than conquerors, you keep us by your love.
[time=3238] You keep us by your love, how high, how high, how high, no matter where I am, healing
[time=3263] is in your hands, how deep, how deep is your love, how strong, how strong is your love,
[time=3278] how high, how high, how high, how high, how high, how high, how high, no matter where
[time=3346] I was excited because I know Eric loves Jesus, and I couldn't wait to see if God would do that.
[time=3353] I knew that Eric would be able to influence others because of his willingness to live out his faith, amen?
[time=3359] And whatever position we're talking about, governmental, educational, neighborhood, that's what I wanna see.
[time=3368] I wanna see people in whatever position who first and foremost live out their faith.
[time=3374] Do the rest of your job well as God would want you to, but all we make the biggest difference.
[time=3380] Healing is in God's hands, and when we pass along God to others, things get better.
[time=3388] Things get back to the way God designed them to be.
[time=3391] Father in heaven, we're grateful for the morning.
[time=3393] We pray for those who are in authority over us this morning.
[time=3397] Oh God, we pray for those who give leadership in our lives on whatever front we know they're there because of you.
[time=3405] And so God, as we submit to them and God, as we pray for them, I pray that you would bless that effort.
[time=3411] I pray that you would grow us as we give ourselves to that.
[time=3414] Humble us, help us to exercise greater levels of wisdom and discernment and tact.
[time=3422] And oh God, I pray that you would give us courage as well because there may come a day and there may be a time when we have to stand up and say no.
[time=3434] No, I'm going to do what God has called me to do and with whatever cost may come, whatever that may bring, I pray God that we as the church could stand with great confidence and boldness out of our love and devotion to you.
[time=3448] Oh God, allow us to interact in this discussion today with those outside of these four walls in a way that draws them to you.
[time=3458] I pray God that as a church we would be, we would be deeply committed to a message that communicates what we're for.
[time=3468] Not so much what we're against or who we're against.
[time=3473] Oh God, may they know that we're for you.
[time=3475] May they know that we're for justice.
[time=3477] May they know that we're for what's right.
[time=3479] May they know that we're for love and peace and gentleness and goodness.
[time=3484] And may you help us carry that message forward and all the people agreed with the prayer and said, amen, God bless you.
[time=3491] (upbeat music)
