[time=614] [MUSIC - 142 seconds]
[time=764] - Well, hello again everybody. Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=767] It is good to be with you. My name's Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Black Hawk, and we have had the honor over these last several weeks at Black Hawk to be engaged in a study, a series that we've entitled, The Untouchables.
[time=782] We've been looking at issues, the church oftentimes tries to stay away from, or when they do deal with these issues, they oftentimes do it in ways that misrepresent the heart of God.
[time=795] And so we've looked at homosexuality.
[time=798] We've looked at social justice issues.
[time=801] We've looked at the issue of politics last week, and today we come to the issue of singleness.
[time=807] How does the church approach?
[time=808] How does the church view those who aren't married?
[time=812] And you may think that's a strange topic, but I'll tell you, I've been in ministry for over 25 years, and I think the church has done a poor job, a really poor job of helping those who aren't married see and understand the great value they have in the kingdom of God.
[time=830] It's a very interesting, at times, dicey topic, and we'll try and look at that today in a way that I hope will bring great clarity, and also great hope.
[time=838] I also want to invite you to come next week and be with us, seriously.
[time=841] Come and be with us on July 8th, and take part in our panel discussion.
[time=847] We're going to have a great panel on stage, some people who can speak to these issues, and the whole morning's going to be teaching through the panel discussion, looking back over the five weeks of the series, and hopefully being able to glean and take away from the series stuff that could really be life-changing and encouraging to you and me in our faith.
[time=868] Thank you so much for being a part of our broadcast family.
[time=871] Thank you for the support and the love and the prayers.
[time=874] I know so many of you offer up for us.
[time=878] We're so grateful we get to do this.
[time=879] So thankful that the word of God gets to come to you on a regular basis.
[time=884] We'll keep doing our very best to do it well.
[time=887] You keep doing your best to support and hold us up in prayer.
[time=890] God bless you.
[time=891] I hope you have a great week, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=894] (gentle music)
[time=904] [MUSIC - 266 seconds]
[time=1175] - We pray for us.
[time=1190] Our Father in heaven, we're grateful for the privilege of worship.
[time=1194] What a joy for us as a family today to be able to stand here and sing these songs.
[time=1199] God, to declare our love for you, to sing about all that is right and good and true about you.
[time=1205] God, to be reminded of your goodness, to be reminded of your great name.
[time=1210] God, to be reminded of your saving and transforming power.
[time=1215] And now we continue in worship.
[time=1217] God, as we come to your word, ancient words ever true with the great capacity to change us, to absolutely and utterly change us.
[time=1232] Our thinking and our motives and our desires and our actions and our spirits.
[time=1237] And so God, we ask that you would do that very thing.
[time=1240] And all the people agreed with the prayer and said, [AMEN] Amen. Good to see all of you here this morning.
[time=1247] We welcome you.
[time=1248] We have at Black Hawk been over these last several weeks engaged in a series that we have entitled The Untouchables.
[time=1256] The Untouchables are a number of different topics, a number of different issues that the church has for the most part over the years tended to stay away from.
[time=1267] These are things that church has sometimes been afraid to speak to.
[time=1271] And so they've just in so many cases said nothing.
[time=1274] There have been times where the church has chosen to say things about these issues and in doing so.
[time=1282] I have completely missed and misrepresented if you will the heart of God.
[time=1287] And so we've tried our very best humbly before God to come to these issues, issues like homosexuality, social justice, politics, this morning's singleness.
[time=1297] And next week we conclude the series and I want to invite all of you to come back and be here.
[time=1301] Next week there's gonna be a panel, discussion and teaching.
[time=1305] We will teach as we discuss.
[time=1307] And we're asking you to write in, we're asking you to submit your questions, we're asking you to give us your feedback, we're asking you to voice concerns or confusion you might have on any of these issues over these last few weeks.
[time=1319] If you look on the screen you can see how it is that you can get your questions in, you can Twitter those questions in, you can Facebook, you can email, you can text it, you can even just call us if you want to.
[time=1332] However it works for you, make sure that you let us hear from you because next week we want to be able to address most of, if not all of the things that you've voiced.
[time=1342] And so this morning we come to the final issue in our series called Untouchables.
[time=1348] We come to the issue of singleness, single.
[time=1352] What comes to your mind, when you hear me say that,
[time=1359] all of a sudden we enter into a very unique world, single, singleness, not married on your own alone?
[time=1368] What are the images that come to your mind
[time=1377] when you think about those who find themselves living in and dealing with the realities of solo living, being single?
[time=1387] You know, I've known many an unmarried or single again person over the years and as time progresses and as they stay in that state or stage of life, I know for some it feels like the slow death of a dream.
[time=1401] A gradual painful realization that something hoped for,
[time=1407] something prayed for, something longed for, quite possibly will not happen.
[time=1413] And yet for others, for others they seem to accept it, graciously, they seem to accept it and deal with it with some form of greater or deeper perspective or a measure of grace.
[time=1428] And yet still for others they can turn bitter and heart-hearted, they can be wracked with frustration, disappointment and discouragement.
[time=1438] It's quite a journey, it's quite an issue.
[time=1443] This thing called singleness.
[time=1445] Those who aren't single struggle at times
[time=1451] to interact with or relate in meaningful ways with those who are.
[time=1456] Singles or single again individuals can grow resentful of and distant from those who are married.
[time=1462] Attitudes can get sideways and dispositions can become burdened and weary.
[time=1469] Some quite frankly find it embarrassing.
[time=1474] It's sad, it's a challenging issue, a difficult road at times to navigate in a God-honoring way.
[time=1481] Questions begin to fill our minds.
[time=1484] As we introduce the topic, do we value as a church, as the body of Christ, as individuals, do we value those who aren't married in appropriate ways?
[time=1494] What does God think?
[time=1497] What is God's mindset toward?
[time=1498] How does God view those who aren't married?
[time=1503] Great questions and ones that will attempt to answer here in the moments to come.
[time=1507] And we will with this issue do what we've done with all the other issues we've tackled in recent days in this series.
[time=1514] We will ask three very important questions.
[time=1516] What does God's word say?
[time=1518] What does culture say about singleness and what should our response be as a church as those in the body of Christ?
[time=1527] How should we view it being single?
[time=1531] Open your Bibles this morning, if you would to first Corinthians chapter seven.
[time=1534] Would you first Corinthians chapter seven, Paul writes to the church at Corinth.
[time=1540] And as some of you know, others of you may not know this, in his letter to the church, his letter is to the church at Corinth.
[time=1546] He writes because they asked questions.
[time=1550] This is Paul writing to the church at Corinth.
[time=1553] And in this section that we'll read here, they have clearly asked him about this issue of singleness.
[time=1559] They're interested in, they're curious, they're struggling with this balance between those who are married and those who aren't.
[time=1566] They want Paul to give them some insight on how they should view this.
[time=1571] And so I invite you to not only turn to 1 Corinthians seven, but to stand this morning in honor of God's word and allow me the privilege of reading this to you.
[time=1580] 1 Corinthians chapter seven, verses 25 to 28.
[time=1584] And then we'll skip down to 32 and 35.
[time=1588] Here you go, Paul answers their question and says, now concerning virgins, stop right there.
[time=1595] I hope you caught that.
[time=1600] Right here we have our first cultural wake-up call.
[time=1605] That in the word of God, singleness and virginity
[time=1611] is what synonymous?
[time=1616] God's design is that those who are married, those who are married would no longer be virgins.
[time=1627] The unmarried, Paul doesn't even refer to them in any other word other than what?
[time=1633] Virgins.
[time=1634] Now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord, but I give an opinion as one who by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy.
[time=1644] Interesting note, let me just read this.
[time=1646] The conviction given here is not a command from God, but it's thoroughly dependable and sound advice to remain a virgin, which is counsel included by the inspiration of the spirit from a trustworthy man.
[time=1663] This is the word of God, it made it in.
[time=1666] This is inspired text.
[time=1668] And though it's not a command of God to do this or do that on the married single thing, what we hear from Paul, God says is important and viable.
[time=1678] I think then that this is good in view of the present distress
[time=1685] that it is good for a man to remain as he is.
[time=1687] Are you bound to a wife, do not seek to be released?
[time=1691] Are you released from a wife, do not seek a wife?
[time=1695] But if you marry, you have not sinned, and if a virgin marries, she or he has not sinned, yet such will have trouble in this life.
[time=1704] And I am trying to spare you down to 32, but I want you, Paul says, to be free from concern for one who is married is concerned, for one who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord.
[time=1722] But once, but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife, and his interests are divided.
[time=1732] The woman who is unmarried and the virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy, both in body and spirit, but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
[time=1747] This I say for your own benefit, not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is appropriate, and don't miss this, and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord.
[time=1763] Undistracted devotion to the Lord.
[time=1768] Before you sit down, I'll just say this to you this morning, all week long, we've been praying for this message.
[time=1775] Because while I know that right out of the gate, there may be a sense where you just immediately find yourself in one camp or the other, one stage of life or the other.
[time=1786] And while you do that, we also know that immediately there's a paradigm that most of you have been functioning with forever about this stuff.
[time=1796] And we believe God has something for you this morning on this front, we believe the word of God has something very powerful for you this morning.
[time=1807] And our hope and our prayer is that you would open your life and your spirit and your heart to what he has for you no matter who you are, no matter what stage or state you're in.
[time=1818] Oh, please allow the word of God to minister to you today.
[time=1823] You may be seated.
[time=1824] Few things to point out to you from the passage we just read, number one, God's design clearly does.
[time=1831] God's design clearly does allow for both.
[time=1835] You see it right there in 27.
[time=1836] Are you bound to a wife?
[time=1838] Do not seek to be released.
[time=1840] Are you released from a wife?
[time=1843] Do not seek a wife.
[time=1845] But if you marry, you have not sinned.
[time=1847] The scriptures clearly establish both as absolutely single and married.
[time=1853] Scriptures clearly establish them here as absolutely acceptable in the eyes of God.
[time=1857] One is not better than the other.
[time=1861] And yet what you will see is that one brings expanded opportunity, both absolutely acceptable
[time=1870] in the eyes of God now.
[time=1871] Now, prior to 27, go back to 26 because in 26, there is this caveat, if you will.
[time=1880] I think then Paul says that this is good in view of the singleness, virginity.
[time=1887] He says, I think this is good in view of the present distress, interesting phrase.
[time=1894] And in light of this present distress that Paul addresses, it's good for a man to remain as he is.
[time=1901] In this case, single.
[time=1902] Here's what's going on there.
[time=1904] I wanna just explain that to you briefly.
[time=1906] Paul knew that there would be some in the church who would be deeply committed to ministry.
[time=1912] He knew there would be some in the body of Christ there in Corinth and all over that region who would want to boldly live out their faith.
[time=1921] He knew there were some in the midst who would want to give their lives to the ministry.
[time=1927] Who would want to see the gospel move forward.
[time=1930] Who would want to see unreached people met with the word of truth.
[time=1934] He knew that there would be those in the family who would really take seriously this idea of going.
[time=1942] And he also knew, most scholars would agree that this distress he's talking about was the beginnings of, there were already the beginnings of persecution.
[time=1954] Persecution was coming and it was coming quickly and within 10 years in Corinth, the church would be absolutely inundated with horrific stuff on the persecution front.
[time=1966] And so Paul, in essence, was saying, and will come to it even more so as the passage progresses.
[time=1972] But even right here, he's saying, in light of what's coming, it just might be better.
[time=1978] If all you have to deal with and all you have to take care of in the midst of what is going to come is you.
[time=1987] Interesting insight on verse 26, but clearly God does allow for both.
[time=1992] Both, second point I want to make is this, marriage brings heartache.
[time=1996] Marriage brings heartache and I told the first hour folks and I'll tell you, I sort of stand in jeopardy this morning.
[time=2003] As we make our way through this, I will definitely come across as if maybe somehow I've got a bone to pick with marriage.
[time=2011] I don't, I like marriage.
[time=2014] Marriage is a good thing.
[time=2015] God's word clearly has given it to us as an option, amen?
[time=2020] It's a good thing.
[time=2022] Please do not sit in judgment of me this morning.
[time=2025] I'm going to try my best to teach you this text.
[time=2029] And as we look at singleness and as we hear Paul's words about marriage, I'm telling you, just let it sit.
[time=2036] Let it come into your heart, let it come into your mind and listen to what it says.
[time=2040] And he says here on this front, he says, marriage brings heartache.
[time=2045] It says it right there in 28.
[time=2047] If you marry, you have not sinned.
[time=2048] If a virgin marries, she has not sinned.
[time=2050] Yet such, those who marry will have trouble in this life.
[time=2055] And I am trying to spare you the trouble of marriage.
[time=2062] That's what it says.
[time=2065] That word trouble there in that text.
[time=2069] If you look that up in the original language, it talks about distress.
[time=2074] It literally describes heartache.
[time=2077] There are pressures that come with marriage.
[time=2082] There are disappointments that come with marriage.
[time=2086] There are struggles unique to marriage that people will always encounter.
[time=2091] There are also joys and many, many blessings in marriage to be sure, but as the text clearly implies, it will be difficult and distracting for those who have the responsibility now of another.
[time=2106] And if you think about it, it's really true.
[time=2108] I thought about it this week.
[time=2109] I read what others said about it.
[time=2112] It was interesting to read and to listen to the perspective of people as they honestly look at this thing called marriage.
[time=2120] Somebody said and I wrote it down.
[time=2122] Marriage is this intimate.
[time=2127] Nowhere to hide.
[time=2129] Pressing together of two fallen sinful people with fallen motives and fallen desires and more often than not earthly expectations mixed with little, if any, tools to navigate the fray.
[time=2145] That depressing enough for you.
[time=2149] This intimate nowhere to hide.
[time=2153] Pressing together of two fallen sinful people with fallen motives and fallen desires and more often than not earthly expectations mixed with little, if any, tools to navigate the fray.
[time=2164] That's why so many marriages fail.
[time=2169] I didn't just burst your bubble.
[time=2173] Did I?
[time=2176] They are failing left and right and center behind.
[time=2186] They are failing every single day and they fail my friends because we bring our expectations and not gods.
[time=2197] They're failing every day because we bring too much of our humanness and not enough of our godliness.
[time=2206] Marriages fail again and again and again because of our faulty approach.
[time=2214] So here's a little quick overview.
[time=2217] Certainly applicable to our text and our message today but just some thoughts I wanna make sure that you consider those of you in the room who are single.
[time=2226] Those of you in the room who are single.
[time=2227] Again, those of you in the room who are married and maybe it's heading toward failure.
[time=2234] I wanna just make sure that we quickly look at this marriages today fail for a lot of reasons.
[time=2239] Here's three, I want you to take note of write these down.
[time=2241] Number one, marriages fail because he, listen, I know Jerry Maguire told you otherwise, he won't complete you.
[time=2251] Please write that down.
[time=2255] He or she will not complete you.
[time=2259] Please know this, I know it's difficult.
[time=2261] I know it's exactly how culture has set you up to think about this.
[time=2266] I know it is exactly the message that you have been kidding from the day you were almost born that there would be somebody someday who would come along and just make it all just right.
[time=2278] Please listen, he or she, whoever they are,
[time=2284] does not possess the missing peace to the puzzle of your fulfillment or happiness.
[time=2290] Marriage will not sure you up.
[time=2293] He or she is not the answer to the pain of your childhood, the regrets of your youth or the dreams of your future.
[time=2310] He or she will not complete you.
[time=2313] So if he or she won't complete you, who will?
[time=2317] What will?
[time=2318] It's time for again, you and I to be reminded of the fact that on this very front and a very real tangible, down deep in your heart and soul, real level, the only person who can complete you is the person of Christ.
[time=2335] This is how we have been designed and it's how marriage was designed.
[time=2339] But see, we've broken off, Philippians 1-6, most of you know it, Philippians 1-6 says, "For I am confident of this very thing." Paul said that he who began a good work in you will perfect it, that work there means complete it.
[time=2354] Until the day of Christ Jesus, Colossians 2-10, write it down, Colossians 2-10 says, "And in him in Christ, you have been made," what?
[time=2364] Say it, church, complete.
[time=2367] And he is the head over all rule and authority.
[time=2371] In Christ you are complete.
[time=2374] He began the work in you, this thing, this heart, this soul in you as the years go by, he is the one.
[time=2381] And only him, not some boy, not some girl Christ in him.
[time=2386] In relationship with him, you and I get all shored up
[time=2395] in the way that God designed us to be.
[time=2398] He won't complete you.
[time=2400] Marriage is fail because she won't love you.
[time=2402] I know that sounds harsh.
[time=2404] You could put he or she there, it's true.
[time=2406] She'll listen, she'll try most of them.
[time=2410] He'll try to love you, but they'll fail.
[time=2415] Don't we?
[time=2419] Bury people, nod your heads.
[time=2422] They'll fail and here's the deal, here's the deal.
[time=2427] If the whole thing in your heart and mind, and boy I've met a lot of you, I've met a lot of people over the years and the whole thing has been built on this.
[time=2437] If the whole thing is built upon the fact that now you're getting married and in this marriage you are finally going to be loved.
[time=2445] Now, now in this situation, now with this person,
[time=2451] oh joy, I finally get to be loved.
[time=2455] I'm gonna be loved, I'm gonna be loved.
[time=2458] And if that's what this thing is built on, that castle will crumble.
[time=2463] It won't work because God only designed you to be loved
[time=2469] by at that level, God only designed you to be loved by Him.
[time=2474] And that would be a capital H, not small.
[time=2478] Only God can love you at the level
[time=2484] at which you and I are longing to be loved.
[time=2488] That's the way it was designed, that's the way it works.
[time=2492] And when you try and do it a different way, I was six years old, I told first hour, I remembered it this morning, I was six years old, going to the store with my mom, grocery store, only child, I did a lot of trips with my mom.
[time=2505] I get in the car with my mom at the six years of age, we go to the grocery store, it was a different trip than any other trip, the car didn't run right, the car was jerky, the car was pulling, all of a sudden there's weird sounds, all of a sudden we're pulling into the grocery store, parking lot, there's smoke, all of a sudden, something's really wrong, about a three, four mile trip.
[time=2525] We pull in, this nice guy comes over, pops the hood, he looks inside, can't figure it out, comes around, looks inside, he used to say, you might want to take your emergency break off.
[time=2534] (audience laughing) Little funny, little funny story.
[time=2538] Yeah, it doesn't work when you try and do it
[time=2545] in ways it wasn't designed to function.
[time=2549] Your marriage gets real smoky, yeah, it starts to smell.
[time=2553] Everything kind of starts wobbling, it doesn't work.
[time=2557] If somehow this is your chance to be loved.
[time=2560] He won't complete you, she won't love you and I'll make a few enemies I know with this one, but music videos and chick flicks are lies.
[time=2569] (audience laughing) Okay, they're just flat out lies.
[time=2576] Here's a guarantee, here's a guarantee for you.
[time=2580] There is no point in time in the life or duration of your marriage when suddenly the music will kick in from the skies.
[time=2588] There will be no music kicking in in your life.
[time=2591] Your marriage is not a soundtrack.
[time=2594] It doesn't work that way.
[time=2598] It's not like that.
[time=2600] It's a lie, it sells tickets.
[time=2604] Makes you download stuff.
[time=2607] It's not true.
[time=2612] In marriage, you'll have trouble, it says.
[time=2616] And he's trying to spare you, it says, from this.
[time=2620] And again, you can say, "Geez, Callie, you're so down on marriage today." Look, I promise you next week, we'll come and look at all the flowery, beautiful passages about marriage.
[time=2630] There are some.
[time=2632] I'm just trying this morning on this topic to get you to think about what it says.
[time=2639] And it says, you'll have trouble.
[time=2643] Singleness allows for a, listen.
[time=2646] Singleness allows for a more focused service to God.
[time=2649] 32 through 35, you see it there.
[time=2653] I want you to be free from concern.
[time=2655] He said one who was unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord.
[time=2659] How he may please the Lord, but then you get married and you're not just thinking about pleasing the Lord, you're thinking about pleasing him.
[time=2666] You're thinking about pleasing her, this undistracted focus.
[time=2671] Observing the Lord tends to all of a sudden become muddied.
[time=2676] And I know I can hear many of you right now saying, you know what I think about that?
[time=2680] I don't want a more focused service to God.
[time=2682] I want a husband.
[time=2683] I want a wife.
[time=2689] I want to do all the things married people do.
[time=2691] I want to get down the road and experience everything.
[time=2693] Everybody from the day I was born has been telling me, was there for me.
[time=2700] And what this passage does, oh, this is the point at which we've been praying for God to speak to you today.
[time=2707] What this passage does is lift up high the value
[time=2714] of serving the Lord.
[time=2721] There is great value in serving the Lord.
[time=2731] Serving him without hindrance and serving him without distraction.
[time=2738] Yes, serving him without another.
[time=2742] This passage is really a biblical confronting
[time=2748] of what has become our cultural norm, our Christian cultural norm.
[time=2755] Listen, this is not a slap on the wrist.
[time=2759] This is not a really an either or, it's a both and and here's what I mean.
[time=2766] What I mean is this and I, I'm the chief of, I'm with you in this.
[time=2772] I have been doing this.
[time=2775] I have been saying this from the day our first child was born and you've been doing the same thing and we hear about it at weddings and we hear about it from moms and dads and you hear about it in the nursery and you hear about it in your small group.
[time=2789] Because from the day they were born, we talk about things like how we have prayed for their future, say it, spouse.
[time=2799] Has anybody from the day they were born been praying for them to be celibate, single and serving God for the rest of their life?
[time=2810] Well, of course not, because we all think single people are weird.
[time=2818] I'm not being mean, no, not even trying to be funny.
[time=2821] It's the notion that we've given this thing and we have so bought into it that from the very beginning, we tell our young boys and we tell our young girls that someday somebody's gonna come along and make them complete.
[time=2838] And we tell them someday you're gonna get married and someday I'm gonna walk you down the aisle.
[time=2846] And again, I'm not trying to make it either or, I'm just saying I think we do a huge disservice.
[time=2852] As I look at this passage and I see it lifting up the great value of being a woman or being a man who is most and absolutely devoted to serving the Lord.
[time=2867] And it's become so much our norm
[time=2874] that to many of you in the room, it almost seems crazy or offensive to suggest that maybe serving God with a singular focus is something that shouldn't be relegated to worst case scenario.
[time=2886] And that's really where it's come.
[time=2890] It's almost like it's worst case scenario.
[time=2893] Maybe I'll have to do this.
[time=2895] I'm so thankful for so many singles in this family.
[time=2901] Watch this video, it's a chance I had to sit down with Janice Morese and I'm so thankful for the insights that she has, so thankful for the heart that she has and so grateful that we could talk about this issue.
[time=2912] And I think especially towards the end, don't sleep.
[time=2915] There's some things at the end of this that are really, really profound.
[time=2920] Listen to Janice and I's conversation.
[time=2922] - I am single and when people ask, I say,
[time=2929] I'm happily single most of the time because average days, I'm really good with where God has me at.
[time=2936] And I really believe that this is, I'm single because that's where God has me.
[time=2941] But there also are really dark lonely days too.
[time=2944] And so I think that's okay.
[time=2946] I think it's, I think we all, whether we're married or single, we have hard difficult days.
[time=2951] And so I was looking back through my journals in preparation for this.
[time=2957] And any time I mentioned my singleness, it usually fell into two categories.
[time=2961] It was either those dark days where I'm crying out to God because I feel lonely and I want companionship.
[time=2969] I want help in making decisions or in living life.
[time=2974] And those hard days, you know, where all you can do is cry out to God.
[time=2979] Because you don't have that person with that intimacy that you can talk with.
[time=2983] And so they were either that or they were moments
[time=2989] where God was just speaking love over my life, versus how deep, how wide, how high the love of God is, or how carefully he cares for our hearts and how he speaks love and truth and how he whispers our name.
[time=3009] And so it's kind of a battle between feeling lonely but knowing that God is love.
[time=3016] That's who he is and having to choose to believe that about God.
[time=3022] I think, you know, my dad used to always say to me, Janice, do you believe who God says he is?
[time=3029] And so in those hard days, I have to ask myself, do I believe that God says he is love, that he has the best meant for me, that he has a plan, that he has a purpose, that he's my rock, that he's my protector, you know.
[time=3045] And so for me being single, sometimes I have to choose to listen to God's voice a little harder because of that, because I don't have an earthly voice saying those things to me.
[time=3056] - What are some ways in which you're encouraged as a single woman today relate with me and our team?
[time=3062] How are you encouraged as you look at our church and the way we come at this?
[time=3067] What are some ways we need to improve and get better?
[time=3070] - Well, I think what we do really well is connecting.
[time=3074] I think I'd be lost without my small group in my family.
[time=3076] I think that's so important.
[time=3078] And so I love that we make an emphasis on connecting and being in small groups.
[time=3083] And I love that we put singles and marrieds together in the same group.
[time=3087] I know that I have two married couples that I meet with every week and they're such an encouragement to me.
[time=3092] And when I need wisdom and when I need comfort, they're there to offer that.
[time=3096] And so I think that's something that we do really well.
[time=3099] And I would encourage us to continue doing that.
[time=3102] When I think about what we could do better, there's two things that come to mind.
[time=3107] And it's more of a mindset, I think.
[time=3109] For me, sometimes I feel like I don't know where I fit in.
[time=3113] On the one hand, I have the world telling me, go do whatever makes you feel well.
[time=3122] Go scour the internet for partners and make sure you're compatible before you get married and the abstinence is insane.
[time=3130] And so I'm hearing all those voices over here.
[time=3133] And then on the other hand, I feel like at church, it's, hey, are you dating somebody?
[time=3138] Oh no, well, you'll find somebody soon.
[time=3141] And that's the end of the conversation.
[time=3142] Like there's no encouragement, there's no what else is going on in your life.
[time=3146] And so I feel like-- - Almost like you're not viable.
[time=3148] - Right.
[time=3149] - Until you get that to your life.
[time=3150] - That my life doesn't start until I'm married.
[time=3153] And it's like those two ends and sometimes I feel lost in the middle of that because the reality is, absolutely I wanna be married, absolutely I wanna have a family.
[time=3162] That's not where I am right now.
[time=3164] And guess what?
[time=3164] I'm happy and I'm content and good things are happening in my life and I'm doing good things.
[time=3170] And so I feel lost between that sometimes.
[time=3173] And then the second thing, and I even battle with this sometimes, I think we fear being single more than we fear marrying the wrong person or marrying an unwise person.
[time=3188] Like the idea of being solitary, not having that partner scares us so much that we're willing to compromise that choice we make.
[time=3197] And I think the consequences of that are huge.
[time=3202] And so I think we need to do a better job of being excited for where people are at.
[time=3208] And I think that goes to like, if you're not dating somebody, it's when you, who you date in, when you're dating someone, it's when you're gonna get married.
[time=3216] When you get married, it's when you're gonna have kids.
[time=3218] And so I think we miss out on celebrating where someone is at, trusting that God is leading them and that he is doing good things in their lives and supporting and encouraging them.
[time=3228] So that's my two cents.
[time=3230] (audience applauds) - Wow, I hope you didn't miss that.
[time=3239] The fear of being single sometimes becomes greater than the fear of marrying the wrong person.
[time=3247] A willingness on their part on ours to celebrate where God has people.
[time=3253] Trusting his good intentions and plans and moving forward in a way that's full of grace.
[time=3259] What does culture say?
[time=3260] First of all, two different cultures.
[time=3262] There's secular culture.
[time=3264] There's the world and it's Janus perfectly articulated.
[time=3268] The world is saying no big deal to singleness.
[time=3271] To them, singleness really isn't that big of a hassle.
[time=3275] Increasing numbers of men and women are waiting longer and longer to marry.
[time=3279] The big reason is the widespread acceptance of moral compromise.
[time=3284] Abstinence is insane, they say.
[time=3289] Abstinence is absolutely uncalled for, they say.
[time=3294] And so with that kind of a mindset on they go to violating what God designed and a mindset that says no big deal.
[time=3303] What is Christian culture?
[time=3305] Say well, it's been well documented already this morning I think.
[time=3309] Christian culture says it's a huge deal.
[time=3312] Now we think something's wrong with them.
[time=3316] We feel sorry for them.
[time=3318] We truly believe and we've been saying it from the day they were born that marriage and family is the ultimate calling.
[time=3326] And so I want you to be so very careful in the days to come.
[time=3331] I want us as a family, corporately to be careful.
[time=3334] I want you as individuals to be careful.
[time=3336] What should our response be?
[time=3338] Please write these down, two things.
[time=3339] Three things, don't assume, please don't assume.
[time=3344] Don't assume something's wrong with them as we've uncovered this morning.
[time=3347] Something might be wrong with who, you.
[time=3352] Be careful how you process all of this and be careful what you say.
[time=3356] Don't assume, celebrate and include.
[time=3358] Celebrate them, celebrate like Janice said.
[time=3361] She's okay being where she is, celebrate that.
[time=3364] Celebrate God's goodness, let's live together under the umbrella of a sovereign God who we believe doesn't make mistakes and let's include each other.
[time=3375] And don't just make them, listen, don't just make them the one who's getting the gift of being included.
[time=3383] You're the married one who's in trouble and heartache.
[time=3388] They don't have that, they're doing you a favor.
[time=3391] Celebrate and include and lastly pray for them.
[time=3396] Pray for who?
[time=3398] Singles, pray for those who are married, married, spray for those who are single, pray for each other and pray that God would give each, the grace and the strength and the courage to live with joy right in the midst of where God has placed them.
[time=3415] Lastly, singles, single again, a word of encouragement to you, don't you dare, don't you dare allow the notion of getting to just be, sometimes singleness gets viewed or talked about as just getting to be with God.
[time=3433] Don't you dare allow the notion of just getting to be with God to become some trite or empty idea?
[time=3441] What a privilege.
[time=3445] For you to serve Him.
[time=3447] What a privilege for you to be intimate with Him.
[time=3450] What a joy to get to be with Him.
[time=3454] The one, listen, the one who we keep telling you to follow, which is who?
[time=3462] Say it, Jesus.
[time=3465] He did that.
[time=3468] He was single, it was just Him and God.
[time=3475] It's a pretty good gig.
[time=3476] Our Father, we pray You'd take these truths
[time=3483] and that You would instill them deep in our souls today.
[time=3486] In Your Son's name, we pray.
[time=3490] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=3505] (upbeat music)
