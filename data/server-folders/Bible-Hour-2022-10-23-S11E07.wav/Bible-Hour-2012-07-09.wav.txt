[time=30] [MUSIC - 177 seconds]
[time=210] - Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=216] It's great to have these few minutes with you.
[time=218] My name's Kelly Bird and I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Blackhawk Ministries, and we have the privilege of bringing you week after week after week what God is doing here in our worship services at Blackhawk Ministries each and every Sunday morning.
[time=233] And I'm thankful for what God is doing in us and so grateful.
[time=237] As I hear from you, as I get your letters and your emails and as we have conversations out and about in this city, it's great to hear that God is at work in you as well, and we're thankful we get to be a part of that.
[time=251] Hey, I want to tell you this as you prepare and as we get ready for our next upcoming series, the series title is The Core.
[time=260] The Core, and what I want to tell you about it is this.
[time=262] You know, what you believe, really, what you really believe to be true in life, and especially what you really believe to be true about God, dictates how you live.
[time=276] It's really true, our beliefs dictate action.
[time=280] The things that we do, the places we go, the stuff that we think, the way that we deal, the ways in which we respond, all of our actions are tied to the central foundational beliefs
[time=294] that we have in our lives.
[time=296] And so we're going to take a number of weeks as we continue to make our way through the summer and look at the core beliefs that Scripture tells us are so very important for us to possess.
[time=308] There are truths that we need to hang on to.
[time=312] There is doctrine.
[time=313] There is truth that if we embrace it and really truly believe it, it will inform our actions.
[time=320] It will help us along the way in life.
[time=323] And so I hope you'll join us.
[time=325] Not only on the broadcast, I hope you'll come and be with us live and in person.
[time=330] Every Sunday morning at 9 and 1045, we would love to have you with us.
[time=334] Can't wait to see what God will do.
[time=336] As we look at the core beliefs that can affect and influence all of our lives each and every day.
[time=343] God bless you.
[time=345] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=366] [MUSIC - 97 seconds]
[time=472] It's a good plan.
[time=475] It happened to me again this week.
[time=477] Happens about every couple months that a guy watches me in the store and say, "I watch the Bible hour every week and you ought to be proud of your son the way he plays that piano." It just happens all the time.
[time=494] I've just started lying and taking credit where it should go to Dave and Laurie.
[time=499] No, thank you, Corbin.
[time=500] Thanks for a great morning.
[time=501] Now Corbin's going to join us over here on this panel.
[time=504] We've been talking about this panel for a few weeks or a great four weeks or so we've had with The Untouchables, a series where it was our effort to try and speak to issues that sometimes, oftentimes, the church stays away from.
[time=520] Or if they don't stay away from it, issues that when they do speak to it, sometimes it feels like they miss the heart of God.
[time=528] And so we have spent four weeks opening up God's Word like we always do here and looking at homosexuality.
[time=535] We've looked at justice, we've looked at politics, and we've looked at singleness.
[time=540] And we've tried our best to do it in a way that would honor God and we've asked you to write in.
[time=544] We asked you to tweet us, we asked you to email us, we asked you to text us and you've done all the above and you've written in and you've dropped by.
[time=551] And so we've got some questions that we want to go over today and hopefully, again, you're going to get taught, you're going to get encouraged, you're going to get a chance to, I think, really receive some wisdom to help you wrestle with these things.
[time=564] Hey, no way in the world in 35 minutes, we could get to all the questions, but just, boy, listen in and we're going to do our best to just walk through some of the ones that came in.
[time=574] And again, I hope you'll just open your hearts and let the Word of God and some of the wisdom that God's going to bring to you today.
[time=582] I hope it'll help shape and form the way we walk away from here today.
[time=585] First question came in, I think, as a result of week one on homosexuality and homosexuality, and then the last week even on singleness.
[time=594] And the question is really basic and simple, but really profound.
[time=598] We'll show it to you on the screen here.
[time=600] Question number one is, where in Scripture does it say that sex before marriage is sinful, not God's design?
[time=611] So, Stephen and I decided that the sex question should go to the kids, so we'll let Corbin take.
[time=618] We'll let Corbin take the first one, and as will be the case all morning, Steve and I, Corbin, we'll just all kind of talk and jump in on each other.
[time=627] But Corbin, take it away. Let's start with this one.
[time=630] Yeah, thank you. Thanks for this question.
[time=635] It's kind of fun. My apologies to parents and kids this morning.
[time=640] There's no way to answer this question without saying the word sex a lot, so I'm going to try to limit it as much as I can, but anyway.
[time=647] That's a good question, because in short, the answer is nowhere.
[time=652] The Bible doesn't say the word premarital sex.
[time=655] If you try to look it up on Bible gateway or look it up in your concordance, you'll get nowhere fast.
[time=660] But the longer answer is this, the Bible speaks to the issue clearly and simply.
[time=667] It just doesn't use the same words that we use because it's written at a time that's not today.
[time=674] Similar to the concept of Trinity, you can't find the word Trinity in the Bible.
[time=678] Trinity is a word that the church came up with to describe the truth about God, that he's one God in three persons.
[time=685] This idea of no sex before marriage is a concept that the church came up with in order to describe some passages of Scripture that describe God's design.
[time=694] So we want to look at those together this morning.
[time=697] Before we look at them, let me just mention that adultery is condemned.
[time=702] Sexual immorality is condemned, and people would say that the Greek word that translates sexual immorality encompasses any type of sex outside of marriage.
[time=714] And so we can infer from those things.
[time=716] But there's some specific scriptures that I want to go to.
[time=719] First Corinthians chapter 7, verse 2.
[time=723] Paul's writing to the church, and he says, "But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband." And a couple observations about this verse.
[time=739] In the context, Paul's saying the sexual immorality and the temptation toward it is running amok, and he says that the solution to it is marriage.
[time=750] Why would Paul pick a solution that wasn't part of God's design?
[time=755] He does, and he says marriage is the cure to this problem with passions that are raging sinfuling.
[time=764] You'll also notice in my wife pointed this out to me.
[time=766] In the second phrase, it says, "Each man should have his own wife." She said, "It's interesting that Paul didn't say each man should have his own woman." It doesn't say, "Go pick one person to handle this problem." He says, "Pickle wife." And in order to have a wife, you need to be in a marriage covenant with them.
[time=785] Same thing for the woman, the woman needs a husband, not a man, a husband, and there's a difference.
[time=791] Another scripture passage that mentions marriage is Hebrews 13-4, and it says, "Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled." For God will judge the sexually immoral and the adulterous.
[time=807] In the middle phrase in the verse, it says, "Let the marriage bed be undefiled." I think that's probably referencing sexual sin after marriage,
[time=818] but it's also implying that a marriage bed could be defiled, excuse me, because of decisions made before the marriage covenant.
[time=827] And so one way to defile the marriage bed, as he describes it, is to bring sexual sin into a marriage.
[time=836] And there's repentance and forgiveness for all of that, but it's just worth mentioning.
[time=840] The only other scriptures I want to point out are just the ones that help us get this concept of a marriage covenant.
[time=846] You know, we do marriage ceremonies around here all the time, especially in the summer, and they're beautiful and they're precious, and they're basically our culture's expression of doing this covenant with God.
[time=859] You see it right away in the beginning of the Bible.
[time=862] In Genesis chapter 2, Adam and Eve were joined together.
[time=867] In Genesis 2, 24 through 25, it says, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." So there's this process of leaving and then being joined together.
[time=881] And the next verse says, "The man and the wife were both naked and were not ashamed."
[time=887] And the implication there is if you're not in a marriage covenant and you're experiencing sexual intimacy, there's shame involved.
[time=895] If you go through the process of Genesis 2, 24, and 25, you get to experience intimacy with no shame, and it's beautiful.
[time=903] Jesus quoted those verses in Matthew 19, and he went on to say, after quoting those verses, he said, "They're no longer two, but one flesh, but therefore God has joined together, let not man separate." So Jesus is saying that when this happens, when there's a marriage covenant, God is involved with the promise of the man and the promise of the woman, and it makes sexual intimacy good and right.
[time=927] Anything else is not his design.
[time=930] That's good.
[time=932] And just from a practical perspective, from experience, I'd say I'd look back on my whole life and, you know,
[time=942] when Paul told the Galatians that the acts of the sinful nature are obvious, and then he lists them.
[time=950] The first one's sexual immorality.
[time=952] It really is. I look back and I see healthy, intimate, physical relationships between husbands and wives really a good thing.
[time=962] Anything other than that led to all kinds of destruction and pain, and I just say it's obvious.
[time=972] Yeah, and I would just, what Corbin said and what Steve just added, I would just say to the room this morning, is absolutely spot on.
[time=983] It is true. It is right.
[time=985] It is consistent with what God's word teaches clearly, and in the original language he's right anytime, anywhere.
[time=992] You see the phrase sexual immorality.
[time=995] It in the Greek, in the Aramaic, in the Hebrew.
[time=998] It always had to do with sexual activity outside of what God designed.
[time=1004] And so Janice's video last week, if you were here, as she was talking about singleness, she mentioned how culture views abstinence today as absolutely insane, and it's true.
[time=1016] This issue is simply and only on the rise in our culture.
[time=1020] This idea of sexual relationship really only inside of marriage
[time=1026] is something that culture today says is ridiculous.
[time=1030] Culture has given up on this principle.
[time=1033] And so we need to, as a family, we need to, as the body of Christ, be willing to say with equal energy, no.
[time=1041] No, in fact, it is God's design.
[time=1043] It's not impossible.
[time=1045] It is what he wants, and we can live this out with great conviction.
[time=1050] And it may be difficult at times.
[time=1053] It may call from you, and it may call from our young people a level of commitment and conviction, but we can build that into them.
[time=1063] We can encourage them with this.
[time=1065] And I want to just make sure we say together collectively, as a family today, it's not insane.
[time=1071] It's obedient, and it's right, and God gives us the grace and power to do it.
[time=1076] Amen? Amen. Good. Really good.
[time=1080] All right, we're going to keep moving here.
[time=1082] Number two, I'll start with this one, and then these guys can jump in.
[time=1085] How can we, great question, again from week one, how can we lovingly convince, it says, how can we lovingly convince homosexuals, individuals that we love and care for,
[time=1097] that the path they've chosen is not God's will?
[time=1103] We saw a number of questions like this coming, and I was thankful for the spirit of the questions.
[time=1109] There's a huge desire on the part of many of you to try and do your best
[time=1115] as this person said, convince people to move toward what is right and true and of God.
[time=1124] Let me read for you.
[time=1126] This is just a reminder for you.
[time=1128] Let me read for you 1 Corinthians 6, 9, 10.
[time=1132] I want to just preface my answer with this passage again, or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=1144] Don't be deceived.
[time=1146] What are the unrighteous?
[time=1147] Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor feminine, nor homosexuals,
[time=1154] nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=1161] Such were some of you, but you were washed, but you were sanctified,
[time=1167] but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the spirit of our God.
[time=1173] First of all, I want to just remind us that it's my hope that in every one of us
[time=1179] there would be the desire to convince, if you will, all of that,
[time=1186] all of them toward what is right and true.
[time=1190] And of God as it relates to those who may struggle with homosexuality, I want to just remind you of something this morning on the how can I convince them front.
[time=1202] I don't believe you can, if I can say it that way.
[time=1211] And I don't know that convincing them is our job.
[time=1217] I believe our job in this arena of trying to see people move toward what is right
[time=1224] and of God.
[time=1225] I believe our part.
[time=1226] Listen, I believe it is for us to pray for them.
[time=1230] And we say that very quickly sometimes.
[time=1233] And so I don't want to say that too quickly today.
[time=1236] I want to invite you to think about the times in which, the amounts of time in which,
[time=1242] the effort and the discipline with which you literally pray for those in your life
[time=1251] who you believe may be walking outside of what God designed.
[time=1256] Is there a willingness in you to really truly pray for them?
[time=1261] To ask God to come and help them.
[time=1264] To pray for their hearts and softness and humility.
[time=1268] And to pray and ask God to work in ways that would be beyond what we could ever imagine.
[time=1274] Do you do that?
[time=1275] Would you do that?
[time=1276] Is there a willingness when it comes to those living outside of the will of God walking in unrighteousness for you and me to sit down and to literally pray for them
[time=1287] on a regular basis.
[time=1290] Intentionally, specifically.
[time=1292] There's a start.
[time=1294] I think you can do that.
[time=1296] The second thing I would say, pray number one.
[time=1300] Secondly, I think it is for us to plead.
[time=1304] And sometimes we don't do a very good job of this.
[time=1306] Sometimes we want to go win an argument.
[time=1309] Sometimes we want to be right.
[time=1311] Sometimes we just want behavior modification.
[time=1314] I would ask you to go and be willing to sit down and plead with them.
[time=1320] Now, you know what?
[time=1321] To do that, there's probably got to be a relationship.
[time=1324] And so I hope in your life there's a willingness.
[time=1327] I hope in your life there's space for you to be building relationship with people.
[time=1332] And as God lays it on your heart and as you have opportunity to, I hope that you would prayerfully plead with them to do what is right to invite them to
[time=1344] obedience.
[time=1345] At that point, I truly believe that it is an issue of their heart and the spirit of God
[time=1351] and what they choose to do.
[time=1352] But oh yes, we can jump into that process.
[time=1355] But I don't think it is for you or I to convince.
[time=1359] Make sense?
[time=1360] Pray and plead two things to keep in mind this morning.
[time=1364] Thoughts on that, Steve?
[time=1366] Corbin?
[time=1367] I just had a quick thought.
[time=1368] You said that it isn't our job to convince them that they're wrong.
[time=1372] Perhaps it's my job to convince them that I have sin that I struggle with every day too.
[time=1378] And maybe the convincing, the loving, convincing that the person's asking about, maybe that lies in some really authentic conversations where I say, "I'm not as normal as you think I am." Because this is a sin and I struggle with it every day.
[time=1393] And I'm a sum of you that Paul's talking about.
[time=1399] And I've been washed and I've been sanctified and I've been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1403] And it brings great freedom.
[time=1404] Do you want that too?
[time=1406] And that's a much different platform than, "Hey, did you know that the Bible says that you're sinning?" It's just different.
[time=1413] Well said.
[time=1414] That's good.
[time=1415] Living out and speaking my faith both in ways that Corbin just said,
[time=1424] helping anybody understand that I am a sinner saved by the grace of God
[time=1432] through the blood of Christ on the cross.
[time=1435] I'm forgiven and you can be forgiven too.
[time=1439] And by the power of the Holy Spirit in sanctification,
[time=1445] I don't have to keep doing those things.
[time=1448] And neither do you.
[time=1450] That's good.
[time=1454] Yeah, that's really good.
[time=1456] That makes sense?
[time=1457] Yeah.
[time=1458] Our hope is that we would be a people that would be deeply committed to in every
[time=1465] situation possible, pray and plead and to plead in ways that allow those
[time=1473] dear friends to see the reality of our lives and the fact that the gospel,
[time=1479] the work of Christ on the cross has freed us as well and we're simply inviting them to that same freedom.
[time=1490] Third one, we're going to just all kind of take a stab at, I'll start with Steve and then go to Corbin.
[time=1495] There were some things they both said, first hour that I think are very profound and helpful.
[time=1499] So we'll start there.
[time=1501] It says, talk about the tension that many of us feel.
[time=1505] When we read in Scripture about personal responsibility and providing for one's family, the Scripture does talk about that, the value of hard work and responsibility and other scriptures that teach us to give to the poor and needy without hesitation.
[time=1520] I understood, we understood the spirit of this question.
[time=1523] It's a struggle many have had for years and that is just this tension between here I am.
[time=1528] I've got my stuff.
[time=1530] I've worked for.
[time=1531] I've got my stuff.
[time=1532] I've earned.
[time=1533] I've got my income.
[time=1534] I've got my resources.
[time=1536] And here are people who desperately need help.
[time=1540] And so I get stuck sometimes in the tension of how much should I give or should I give it all.
[time=1545] And by the way, why aren't you working?
[time=1547] Or why aren't you doing this?
[time=1548] Why don't you do that?
[time=1550] It can get real ugly and we can get real stuck.
[time=1553] And I just thought, you know what, this morning, let's just speak to that tension one more time so we can at least get some wisdom on it.
[time=1559] Steve, what are some thoughts you've got for us?
[time=1562] First Timothy 5 was a lesson I learned a long time ago about taking care of my relatives.
[time=1567] They're really talking about taking care of widows there.
[time=1570] But then Paul explains to Timothy what it means to really take care of your relatives.
[time=1576] And he says, give the people these instructions too so that no one may be open to blame for Timothy 5, 7.
[time=1581] If anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for his immediate family, he is worse than an unbeliever.
[time=1591] Ooh.
[time=1592] I remember when I told my dad that he said, no, you don't owe me.
[time=1595] And in 1 Timothy 5 it also says, I need to repay my parents.
[time=1599] It says I need to repay them for what they did for me.
[time=1602] And I remember, I may have told you this before, but I just said, you know what, dad, I know you don't want me to do that.
[time=1607] I know it's not the American way.
[time=1610] But I just want you to know, I need to honor God.
[time=1614] And so I'm only going to change your diapers for a couple of years.
[time=1618] And I'm only going to take care of you financially for 22 years after that you're on your own so I can repay you.
[time=1626] And we had a laugh and it went okay, but I do.
[time=1629] I owe.
[time=1631] And it says your relatives and especially your immediate family.
[time=1636] So there's something there.
[time=1637] So that's a tension I live in.
[time=1639] Also, when I bump into people that appear to have real need, there's a tension that I live in.
[time=1646] And I'll just tell you, my tension really isn't about not having enough to take care of my family and them.
[time=1653] The tension I live in is I want more.
[time=1656] And when I give them what I have, I don't get more.
[time=1660] That's my problem.
[time=1662] I live in a land of plenty.
[time=1664] Nancy and I have plenty.
[time=1666] And so for me, that's not it.
[time=1668] I can do both.
[time=1671] I don't know to what extent.
[time=1672] But I think God wants me in that tension filled relationship with him.
[time=1677] Or he'd tell me how much I should do it.
[time=1679] He would have said give $13.72 to the people that are in need.
[time=1685] He can do that.
[time=1687] But he didn't.
[time=1688] But he wants me.
[time=1690] And I'm so utterly dependent on him for these kinds of things.
[time=1693] Every day it's like tension, but it's healthy.
[time=1698] Well said.
[time=1699] In case you didn't sense it, I'm just telling you that right there is wisdom.
[time=1705] And we learned a few weeks ago with Henry Cloud that whenever you and I hear wisdom,
[time=1712] we get to do one of two things.
[time=1714] We're trying to adjust the wisdom to keep us feeling better.
[time=1719] Or we adjust ourselves in order to receive the what?
[time=1724] The wisdom.
[time=1725] I would beg you.
[time=1727] All wisdom comes from above.
[time=1729] Yeah, sorry.
[time=1730] I'm pointing to him.
[time=1731] Yeah.
[time=1732] I meant to point that way.
[time=1733] You get what I'm saying.
[time=1734] That's good wisdom right there.
[time=1736] And I hope you'll take it in.
[time=1738] Corbin, what else you got there?
[time=1740] I just shared first hour that on a real practical level with this issue of giving to others and providing for a family.
[time=1748] I remember wrestling with it shortly after Tony and I got married nine years ago.
[time=1753] And I came home and I was saying, well, I feel like all these needs are out there.
[time=1757] And I want to help meet him.
[time=1759] But if I'm putting you in jeopardy or me in jeopardy, I just want to know.
[time=1763] And how do we do this?
[time=1764] And we got some good advice and put a plan in place.
[time=1768] We figured out what percentage of my salary we could live on.
[time=1772] And then we started setting aside with direct deposit and internet banking just every time I got paid a little chunk of money went into this separate account.
[time=1784] And we call it our giving account.
[time=1786] And it's the account where we can just go and see if there's any money to help meet needs.
[time=1792] And I'm sure that, well, our prayer was that that account would be spirit-led, that there would be surprising things in our lives that we feel like God wants us to help with.
[time=1801] And then I'm sure that we've messed it up somehow, given to people the wrong way or enabling them to not get a job or whatever.
[time=1811] But we're just trusting God to use that part of our income to teach us good lessons.
[time=1816] And then what it does for me, too, is when that account is empty and God puts something on my heart to give, then I can go to Tanya and say, "I think God wants me to give and it's going to hurt."
[time=1826] Because we have to dip into the chunk of change that we set aside to meet our needs.
[time=1830] So how are we going to do this?
[time=1831] What are we going to sacrifice?
[time=1832] What are we going to do?
[time=1833] We've got to give some stuff up.
[time=1834] Are you good with it?
[time=1835] I'm good with it.
[time=1836] Okay, let's do it.
[time=1837] And I'm a real structured black and white person, so to be able to go to the bank account and look at all that stuff is really helpful.
[time=1846] Wisdom.
[time=1847] It's good.
[time=1848] It's good for us to think it through in real big picture levels.
[time=1854] It's great to think it through in terms of different accounts and practically just on a monthly basis, giving yourself some space to respond.
[time=1864] Good things.
[time=1865] I would just add this and then we're going to move on.
[time=1867] You all, most of you know, if you've been around Black Hawk at all, you know that we're trying our very best with God's help to grow you into being followers.
[time=1875] Being followers of who?
[time=1878] Say it loudly.
[time=1879] Christ.
[time=1880] There you go.
[time=1881] So I would invite you as being one with you who feels this tension at times.
[time=1887] I would invite you to go to the Gospels.
[time=1889] I would.
[time=1890] Go read through the Gospels and I would invite you to look and see as you read how did Jesus respond to those with need?
[time=1899] What kind of hesitation do you sense?
[time=1902] How did he seem to navigate those opportunities and situations?
[time=1906] Read through the Gospels, read through the Book of Acts and see how those who followed Jesus handled this tension.
[time=1914] I think as you read that, I think God will give you great wisdom and insight as to how you can with great freedom live in this tension and be the kind of people that represent the heart of our Lord.
[time=1927] Good question.
[time=1928] Number four, in light of this had to do with our message on government and politics and how we live under and in the midst of that, in light of what Kelly taught recently regarding our approach to those in government, pray for them and submit to them.
[time=1943] How would you assess the involvement of the great German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer in the plot that he was a part of to murder Adolf Hitler?
[time=1956] This is a very interesting question, it brings up all sorts of issues, it's historical in nature, it's theological in nature.
[time=1966] There are great implications from this and so against even I felt like it would be best for Corbin to answer it.
[time=1976] And he answered a great first hour and again we'll jump in but I just again listen, listen and just think about this.
[time=1984] And if there's tension in the room when we're done great, I just think it's good for us to think this stuff through, go ahead.
[time=1991] Well first of all I'm not a historian so I don't know all the details of Bonhoeffer and Hitler and how this all went down.
[time=1998] Second of all I thought when you first read the question, it sounds like Bonhoeffer's just wrong, I mean you don't murder people.
[time=2005] I know that Adolf Hitler's bad but I know that praying and submitting to government is really important and it's biblical.
[time=2012] I tried to think about it some more and really just boiled it down to is there a way that Bonhoeffer could have been right?
[time=2019] That's really between him and God.
[time=2021] And the question is is there a way that he could have been right because Kelly preached a few weeks ago about how we always need to submit to governing authorities except when governing authorities ask us to disobey God.
[time=2034] I gave the examples of Paul and John, I think no Peter Peter and John, defying the Sanhedrin, you know Daniel didn't know by the government.
[time=2044] I was reading about Gideon and Barak and Samson and these are all people that over three governments in the book of Judges and then Hebrews 11 says these were men of faith, they did a good job.
[time=2054] So there are exceptions, so my question in the last few days to myself has just been you know, it was Bonhoeffer an exception to the rule and I don't really know.
[time=2065] I don't know the ins and outs of Adolf Hitler's psychotic nature.
[time=2072] I know that he was evil, I know that he was killing Jews, I know that he was killing Africans, I know that he was killing people with mental and physical disabilities.
[time=2082] But I don't think he was persecuting Christians and when we were reading you know those passages in 1 Timothy and in Romans you were saying it's in light of Nero's rule and Nero was the guy that was persecuting believers.
[time=2101] So what I want to do for you in the next couple minutes is just look at some passages of Scripture that talk about persecution and some that talk about oppression.
[time=2108] And I think there's a difference and I think sometimes we're called to be diligent in fighting oppression but bearing up underneath persecution.
[time=2120] So let's just look at some of these verses together.
[time=2123] Persecution was promised, Jesus promised that it would happen, Paul reinforced the promise of Jesus and believers are called to come up underneath this persecution to bear up under it.
[time=2135] Well Matthew chapter 10 is the first verse we'll go to.
[time=2139] You should read the whole chunk of Jesus' words in Matthew 10 but we'll zero in on verse 22.
[time=2144] He's talking to his disciples and he says, "You will be hated by all for my name's sake, but the one who endures to the end will be saved."
[time=2154] He doesn't say that you're supposed to kill your persecutors, he doesn't say you're supposed to disobey your persecutors, he says you're supposed to endure them.
[time=2163] He promised it was going to happen.
[time=2165] John 15, Jesus is talking to the disciples there too and in verse 20 he says, "If they persecute me, which we know they did, they will also persecute you."
[time=2176] He promises it there and then Paul mentions it in 2 Timothy 3, 12 he says, "Indeed all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted."
[time=2187] So part of me thinks that the reason Paul's asking people to submit to Nero is because Nero is helping to fulfill the promises of Christ and this really sad and horrible way when he's running after the people of God and persecuting them.
[time=2204] Now on the other hand the Scripture talks about oppression.
[time=2208] There are evil oppressive people and governments that should be stood up against.
[time=2215] Look at Psalm 72, this is a psalm that they sang as a prayer for the king of Israel.
[time=2222] And in verse 4 it says, "May he the king defend the cause of the poor of the people, give deliverance to the children of the needy and crush the oppressor."
[time=2234] Sometimes God calls for the oppressor to be crushed.
[time=2238] Isaiah 117, Webster mentioned this verse a few weeks ago, it says, "Learn to do good, seek justice, correct oppression."
[time=2250] And then Isaiah 58 says, "Lose the bonds of wickedness, undo the straps of the yoke, let the oppressed go free and break every yoke."
[time=2260] So I think my question back to whoever asked the original question was Hitler a persecutor or an oppressor and that impacts how I determined what Bonhoeffer did.
[time=2272] I think it gets real shady when you talk about murder because murder is really wrong.
[time=2278] But there are also places in the Bible where it talks about killing and killing being a way to do good ultimately.
[time=2286] And so it just kind of gets fuzzy and confusing. So those are my thoughts.
[time=2290] Good thoughts. Good thoughts. Add a few to that Steve.
[time=2296] The only thing I'd add is that as I reflect back on historical decisions that people have made, I know that I don't know much about the position they were in no matter what I read.
[time=2310] I wouldn't do, based on what I understand the scripture to say, I wouldn't do today what Bonhoeffer was planning to do.
[time=2322] I don't think I should. I think God can do that if he chooses to.
[time=2328] But I also am not going to judge him because that's between him and the Lord. I just know today I wouldn't, I would not think it necessary for me to take that kind of action.
[time=2340] I think it would be sinful and wrong for me to do that.
[time=2347] Just another thought too. Some of you might be wondering if you should even bother reading any of the great books that Dietrich Bonhoeffer has written.
[time=2355] Well, if he was going to do that, what about this book? And is it any good? And should I bother?
[time=2359] And I've read Life Together by Dietrich Bonhoeffer. I think it's an amazing book that any of you should read.
[time=2365] And I think we just need to remember when we find out what authors or people are doing to sin against the Lord.
[time=2373] We should remember that we're all sinners. And I would just kind of throw out the idea that King David wrote some amazing songs and I love them.
[time=2382] And I read them a lot. And he was successful in his murderous plot to kill Uriah.
[time=2388] And it doesn't mean King David was right at all. He was a sinner and he repented of it.
[time=2394] But what it means is that people can be used by the Lord to write good stuff even in the midst of their depravity.
[time=2403] And if you study it at all, you look into Bonhoeffer, you find out that he at one point really did communicate the fact that he believed what he was doing was outside God's design.
[time=2412] He did it out of conviction for his countrymen. He was arrested and he was executed.
[time=2418] And that's kind of how that went. But it is a great question and one that allows us to think about things that I believe are important for us as we try to walk and navigate this road of life and belief and faith and government.
[time=2433] So keep thinking with us.
[time=2435] Hey, to honor time, I'm going to skip one here and I want Steve to address a question that came in. It was about a page long. It was very well done.
[time=2443] It had to do with the government. It had to do with our founding fathers. It had to do with how much should we speak up. It had to do with how active should we be.
[time=2452] And I've heard several questions following our message on the believer in politics. And I just wanted Steve to answer this.
[time=2462] Steve has had a lot of years, but he's also had a lot of time spent teaching government here. In fact, I didn't even introduce you when we started.
[time=2470] There may be a whole bunch of folks in here who don't even know who this silver haired sage is up here.
[time=2476] So just real quick, before you answer that, just give him a quick bio on your years here and things you've done and been a part of.
[time=2483] I came here in 1979 and met Del Hartman when he was 55 and I really thought he was old then. And I worked at the school for 24 years on the staff here at the church all that time.
[time=2498] And I have a chance to work at Ambassador Enterprises where I get to do ministry there. I'm grateful.
[time=2508] I believe the form of government is not as significant as we often make it out to be. And at the same time, I'm very thankful that I live here where the form of government is what used to be a republic.
[time=2527] It's an interesting transition we've been going through the last 75 years in our country.
[time=2536] This question was really a quote from the Declaration of Independence and it was about, I don't know, eight paragraphs long or something.
[time=2544] And it was the defense for why the United States, no, the colonies had the right to defend their rights. A lot of people look at it that way.
[time=2556] And I used to, when I taught government, I had students go home at the beginning of the term and ask their parents if the issues came up today under our government that came up for them,
[time=2571] would they fight with the English or would they fight with the colonies? And it was good debates. We had good discussions about that.
[time=2578] I remember the debate because I was in his class.
[time=2581] You probably ask your dad.
[time=2586] Well, whether they had the rights to defend their rights or not, I don't know. I will know this.
[time=2595] I want to submit to my government the way Kelly taught us the way I think the word does, unless the government tells me to do something that God tells me not to do.
[time=2606] I will not do that. I want to obey the government. It's what Peter and John were talking about to the Sanhedrin. They're in Acts 4.
[time=2614] I will not do that. I will not keep from doing something that God tells me to do either.
[time=2622] So I won't do the admission or the commission.
[time=2626] I will suffer the consequences for that rather than rebel against it.
[time=2632] And I think the real issue is, do I really believe it's about here and now?
[time=2639] Or do I really believe my life here and now is about then and there?
[time=2646] Now, that's the real rub for me. So I'm willing to suffer some things. Paul lived in some really difficult times and so did all the first century believers, incredibly difficult times.
[time=2658] So at the same time that I'm going to say, thank you, Lord, for letting me live here in the United States of America in these days. I'm so grateful.
[time=2664] I'm also going to say, but I know it's not about here and now.
[time=2673] So if we have to suffer, I'm willing to suffer. Francis Schafer used to say, you could protest.
[time=2679] I think we have the right to do that. We should do that. There are some things we should be protesting that are going on right now in our country.
[time=2687] More than I do now. We have the right to flee. I can leave, but you know what? I'm realizing I've been around the world. There's nowhere to go.
[time=2696] It's all like this. It's the world.
[time=2701] So I'm going to choose not to do it or to do it and I'll suffer the consequences. That's where I am.
[time=2710] Good wisdom. I hope you're taking notes.
[time=2714] I'm going to invite Corbin to take his place over at the piano. We're going to wrap this up so much more.
[time=2721] If you have more questions, please keep them coming. We'll do our best to engage you in that.
[time=2726] I will just leave us with one thought. Somebody wrote in. I appreciated, I think, the intent or the spirit of the question.
[time=2734] They wrote in and they said, as it relates to sin in a believer's life and patterns of sin that we're fighting against, I think the question read, is it possible that recovery?
[time=2749] You know, we used the phrase recovery these days in a lot of settings and this person was just wondering if I felt like recovery and its modern day usage was maybe an excuse for people to just continue in sin.
[time=2764] And my short answer is no. My long answer is no.
[time=2773] And I think the reason I say that is this, one qualifier, if by recovery we're talking about a recovery process that is God-oriented.
[time=2783] If recovery in your situation, whatever you're in recovery from, is God-centered, then I would say recovery is synonymous with sanctification.
[time=2794] I believe it's a word we've come up with to describe a process by which we hope and pray and believe God is growing us.
[time=2803] So whatever sin it is you're trying to fight against, God bless you for trying to fight against it. If you're in a program where are those who are helping you with that and encouraging you and holding you accountable and you're in recovery, great.
[time=2817] That's God-centered. That is a fantastic place to be. God bless you in your recovery and your ongoing process of sanctification as he, as he, not a program, as he makes you over time more and more like his son, amen?
[time=2836] All right, hey, would you just sit and listen? As Corbin and Tonya lead us in a song, and then when they're done with this, we'll get a chance to worship one more time together before we go.
[time=2866] If I know hope within, to call my own, for I'm frail of heart, my strength is gone, but deep within my soul, it's rising up a song, here in the comfort of the faithful one.
[time=2894] I walk a narrow road throughout these deep, in search of high ground on mountains deep, and low with fit on sure, I still keep pressing on, for I am guided by the faithful one.
[time=2923] Faithful, faithful to the end, my true and precious food, you have been faithful, faithful to faithful to me.
[time=2954] I see your wounded hands, I touch your side, with thorns upon your brow, you bend and die, but there's an empty tube, I love for all who come, and give their hearts to you.
[time=2981] Faithful, faithful to the end, my true and precious food, you have been faithful, faithful to faithful.
[time=3010] Faithful, faithful to me.
[time=3034] Faithful, when the race is won, I move out down before it's only some, and I will have my hands, and it's for all you do, and I will worship you.
[time=3060] Faithful, when the race is won, my faithful one.
[time=3090] Can we stand together and sing this song?
[time=3110] You could hold the wealth of God, such treasure found in him.
[time=3120] You could comprehend his heart and mind, such wisdom has no hand, from him, through him, to him our own thing.
[time=3139] To be the glory, for heaven, to be the glory, for heaven, to be the glory, for heaven, to be the glory,
[time=3165] for heaven, to be the glory, Lord, amen.
[time=3177] Who has known the mind of God, and who has counseled him?
[time=3188] Who has given gifts to God, that he might be repaid?
[time=3197] From him, through him, to him our own things, through him, to him our own things.
[time=3218] To be the glory, for heaven, to be the glory, Lord, amen.
[time=3241] In dark and life, in death and life, when our times enter in, in all things we will worship you.
[time=3257] When there is no end, there is no end.
[time=3267] To be the glory, for heaven, to be the glory, Lord, amen.
[time=3314] From him, through him, to him our own things.
[time=3327] Glory to God, glory to God, glory to God forever.
[time=3365] Glory to God, glory to God forever.
[time=3437] Take my life and let it be consecrated, Lord, to be.
[time=3451] Take my moments and my days.
[time=3458] Let them flow in ceaseless place.
