[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Good morning, everybody.
[time=32] It's nice to see you today.
[time=33] I'd like to invite you to stand together, and we're gonna begin our time of worship today, singing these songs to the Lord, because he is holy, and there is none like him, and he is worthy of our praise.
[time=47] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 510 seconds]
[time=560] - Jim Pearson passed away last Tuesday, but Jim is very much alive today.
[time=565] And I wanted to encourage you with those words this morning.
[time=569] Mark Posbasal, friend of mine, is speaking at Brookside this morning on these words from 2 Corinthians 4.
[time=576] So we do not lose heart.
[time=579] Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.
[time=585] For this light, momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison.
[time=593] As we look not to the things that are seen, but the things that are unseen.
[time=597] The things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.
[time=603] Take great comfort in those words this morning.
[time=606] I was incredibly encouraged to watch Blackhawk the chapel and Brookside come together to celebrate Jim's life and ministry.
[time=614] Last Friday, if you were there, you were proud as well.
[time=617] If you weren't, you would have been.
[time=620] Please keep praying for Linda, for Kyle, and for Missy as they reckon life for life here without Jim.
[time=628] John Such will be here in next week to share with us more on that in just a minute.
[time=633] He told me on Friday at the memorial service at the funeral for Jim Pearson that this was his text.
[time=640] They're working through Thessalonians at Wallen.
[time=642] And these verses were John's assigned text for this week.
[time=646] Listen, this is 1 Thessalonians 4.
[time=650] But we don't want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope.
[time=657] For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep.
[time=666] For this we declare to you by word from the Lord that we who are alive who are left until the coming of the Lord will not precede those who have fallen asleep.
[time=674] For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command with the voice of an archangel and with the sound of the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
[time=683] Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.
[time=692] He ends with verse 18, therefore encourage one another with these words.
[time=698] I encourage you with those words this morning.
[time=701] I'm so sorry I couldn't be with you last week as we wrapped up the untouchable series with the panel.
[time=705] I wanted to be two places at once.
[time=709] We begin a new series this week called Core, Core Understanding.
[time=712] We felt it's important as a church that we lay out before you key theological principles,
[time=718] understanding regarding several things.
[time=721] We'll begin this morning with Word with the Word of God.
[time=724] How should we think about God's Word?
[time=727] As I mentioned next week on July 22nd, John suits will be with you from Wallen Baptist Church.
[time=733] Such a great friend, John.
[time=735] Josh Rang on sin to follow after that.
[time=737] Jesse Hanna on Christ.
[time=739] And following that kelly bird on the church.
[time=743] We'll have another panel on August 19th like we did last week here at Blackhawk to field and to answer all of your questions.
[time=750] So please, all the information will be in the screens here before you.
[time=753] And please continue to write in over these next five weeks with your questions.
[time=759] Write in.
[time=760] Call us.
[time=761] Tweet us.
[time=762] Facebook us.
[time=763] Whatever verb you want to use.
[time=764] However you would like to get in touch with the church.
[time=766] We do have phones and we do get regular mail.
[time=769] So that works for you.
[time=770] That's good.
[time=771] But all of the information is their friends.
[time=772] Phone numbers.
[time=773] Email addresses.
[time=774] Twitter.
[time=775] Facebook.
[time=776] All of it.
[time=777] We're going to take all of these topics and this array of speakers over the next five weeks.
[time=782] All of your questions regarding all these very foundational fundamental topics.
[time=786] And then do our best to responsibly respond to what you've asked.
[time=791] We're very excited about this.
[time=793] We've been talking about it for weeks and weeks of time and we could not be more excited about the speakers that are lined up to come.
[time=799] And as the band comes up this morning, I think it will be appropriate as we begin a conversation about the word of God and really what the word of God says about itself, it's appropriate to sing and to pray that God would indeed speak to us in his word.
[time=814] You're going to hear a lot from the word of God this morning.
[time=816] And I'm so grateful for Dave coming to read God's word over you.
[time=820] And again, to listen to what God's word says about itself.
[time=825] May he add his blessing to the reading of his word.
[time=827] May he go before this conversation that we're going to have this morning.
[time=839] Joyful are people of integrity who follow the instructions of the Lord.
[time=844] Joyful are those who obey his laws and search for him with all their hearts.
[time=850] They do not compromise with evil and they walk only in his paths.
[time=856] You have charged us to keep your commandments carefully.
[time=860] Oh, that my actions would constantly reflect your decrees.
[time=865] Then I will not be ashamed when I compare my life with your commands.
[time=871] As I learn your righteous regulations, I will thank you by living as I should.
[time=878] I will obey your decrees.
[time=880] Please do not give up on me.
[time=895] To receive the food of your holy word.
[time=903] Take your truth planted deep in us.
[time=910] Shape and fashion us in your lightness.
[time=918] Let the light of Christ might be seen today in our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
[time=935] Speak, O Lord, in fulfillment as all your promises for your glory.
[time=952] Your eternal word, O Lord, stands firm in heaven.
[time=956] Your faithfulness extends to every generation as enduring as the earth you created.
[time=964] Your righteous regulations remain true to this day.
[time=968] For everything serves your plans.
[time=971] If your instructions hadn't sustained me with joy, I would have died in misery.
[time=977] I will never forget your commandments.
[time=980] For by them you give me life.
[time=983] I am yours.
[time=984] Rescue me.
[time=986] For I have worked hard at obeying your commands.
[time=989] Though the wicked hide along the way to kill me, I will quietly keep my mind on your laws.
[time=997] Even perfection has its limits, but your commands have no limit.
[time=1008] O Lord, O Lord, for the obedience, holy reverence through humanity.
[time=1023] Test our thoughts and our attitudes in the radiance of your purity.
[time=1037] As our faith to rise, cause our eyes to see, or majestic love and authority.
[time=1055] Words of power that can never fail, let their truths prevail.
[time=1066] Over I believe.
[time=1071] You have done many good things for me, Lord, just as you promised.
[time=1076] I believe in your commands.
[time=1078] Now teach me good judgment and knowledge.
[time=1081] I used to wander off until you disciplined me, but now I closely follow your word.
[time=1087] You are good, and do only good.
[time=1090] Teach me your decrees.
[time=1092] Arrogant people smear me with lies, but in truth I obey your commandments with all my heart.
[time=1099] Their hearts are dull and foolish, but I delight in your instructions.
[time=1105] My suffering was good for me, for it taught me to pay attention to your decrees.
[time=1111] Your instructions are more valuable to me than millions in gold and silver.
[time=1122] O Lord, and renew our minds.
[time=1128] Help us grasp the heights of your path, O rubs.
[time=1137] Truths unchanged from the dawn of time, that will let go down through eternity.
[time=1151] And by grace we'll stand on your promises.
[time=1160] And by faith we'll walk as you walk with us.
[time=1169] Speak, O Lord, till our church is filled.
[time=1176] And the earth is filled with your glory.
[time=1206] Father, speak to us in your word this morning.
[time=1218] Prepare us even now.
[time=1222] Open our eyes to behold wonderful things from your law.
[time=1228] Heavenly Father, we need you today.
[time=1230] We need your eyes to see, your ears to hear.
[time=1235] Father, I pray that you would go before this time.
[time=1238] I pray that you would indeed add your blessing to the reading of your word.
[time=1242] I pray that our devotion to you and to your word would be demonstrated to God beyond this time,
[time=1249] this assembly, and throughout the week.
[time=1251] I pray all these things in Jesus' name.
[time=1254] [AMEN] William Tyndale gave himself methodically to good works because, as he said,
[time=1264] my part be not in Christ if mine heart be not to follow and live according as I teach.
[time=1272] On Mondays he visited other religious refugees from England.
[time=1276] On Saturdays he walked into our streets seeking to minister to the poor.
[time=1281] On Sundays he dined in merchants' homes reading scripture.
[time=1285] And before and after dinner, the rest of the week he devoted to writing tracks and books and translating the Bible.
[time=1292] We do not know who financed and planned the plot that ended his life, but we do know it was carried out by Henry Phillips, a man who had been accused of robbing his father and of gambling himself into poverty.
[time=1304] Phillips became Tyndale's guest at meals and soon was one of the few privilege to see his tracks and papers.
[time=1310] In May 1535, Phillips lured Tyndale away from the safety of his quarters into the arms of soldiers.
[time=1319] Tyndale was immediately taken to the castle of Vilvorde, the great state prison of the low countries and accused of heresy.
[time=1326] Trials for heresy in the Netherlands were in the hands of special commissioners of the Holy Roman Empire.
[time=1332] It took months for the law to take its course.
[time=1335] During this time Tyndale had many hours to reflect on his own teachings like this passage from one of his tracks.
[time=1342] "Let it not make thee despair, neither yet discourage thee, O reader, that it is forbidden, the in pain of life and goods,
[time=1351] or that it is made breaking of the king's peace, or treason unto his highness to read the word of thy soul's health.
[time=1360] For if God be on our side, what matter makeeth it?" he said.
[time=1365] "Who be against us? Be they bishops, cardinals, or popes."
[time=1371] Finally, in early August 1536 Tyndale was condemned as a heretic, degraded from the priesthood and delivered to the secular authorities for punishment.
[time=1381] On Friday, October 6, after local officials took their seats, Tyndale was brought to the cross in the middle of the town square and given a chance to recant.
[time=1390] That refused, he was given a moment to pray. English historian John Fox said he cried out, "Lord, open the king of England's eyes."
[time=1401] Then he was bound to the beam, and both an iron chain and a rope were put around his neck.
[time=1407] Gunpowder was added to the brush and logs. At the signal of a local official, the executioner standing behind Tyndale quickly tightened the noose, strangling him.
[time=1418] Then an official took up a lighted torch and handed to the executioner who set the wood ablaze.
[time=1425] One other brief report of that distant scene has come down to us.
[time=1429] It is found in a letter from an English agent to Lord Cromwell two months later.
[time=1434] They speak much, he wrote, of the patient's sufferance of Master Tyndale at the time of his execution.
[time=1444] Why would William Tyndale endure such suffering, such ignominy, such pain, tortured to death?
[time=1455] What was Tyndale's heresy? What was his crime?
[time=1459] His crime was the translation of the Bible into the common language of the people.
[time=1466] He was willing to endure things I cannot imagine, all for the sake that men and women, like you and me, could read the word of God.
[time=1476] That it would not be reserved for the privileged few, but that all would have access to what God's word says.
[time=1483] Friends, William Tyndale leaves us a rich, rich heritage in the church.
[time=1491] We owe a debt of gratitude to him that I can hardly overstate to you this morning.
[time=1496] I didn't count, I probably should have counted this week.
[time=1499] But I probably have in my possession at home or at my office, here at the church, two dozen Bibles in my own language and in others.
[time=1510] All available to me in large part friends because of the sacrifices of a man like William Tyndale, he treasured the word of God that much.
[time=1519] Did you hear what Dave read from the word of God just a minute ago, from the Psalms?
[time=1524] The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces.
[time=1532] If I was digging in my backyard this week and I found thousands of gold and silver pieces, I would tell somebody, it would be news.
[time=1539] I might even call news cameras to come to my home and say, "Look at what I found."
[time=1545] And yet those dozens of Bibles in my possession sometimes don't spark conversation.
[time=1552] Even it is convicting friends this morning.
[time=1556] On our church website, there is much information which may not be surprised to you about what we think in this place about the Bible.
[time=1564] And that also is part of Tyndale's legacy.
[time=1567] If you go to our website, bacaclanoches.org and go to our beliefs under the About tab, you'll see their information about our beliefs about the Bible in particular.
[time=1577] At the bottom of the page, there's a separate section totally devoted to this topic.
[time=1582] What do we believe about the Bible?
[time=1585] I would encourage you to go this week.
[time=1587] I will not walk you through it this morning.
[time=1588] I would encourage you to go this week and just pay careful attention to everything that you see there, specifically this.
[time=1594] God's word is inspired.
[time=1598] And we use a very loaded word on the website that I'm so glad that we do.
[time=1601] The word is inerrant.
[time=1603] That is not a word that many people use these days, dear friends.
[time=1606] It means the Bible is without error.
[time=1609] And other folks, other churches, other universities, other colleges are very nervous about that word for a number of reasons that I won't have time this morning to unpack with you.
[time=1620] But we are using that word today on our website with great confidence and with great boldness.
[time=1626] That God's word is without error.
[time=1629] And if you see on the screens in front of you, friends, behind me, again, you can look at it today.
[time=1634] We believe that God's word is inspired 2 Timothy 3 16, breathed out by God.
[time=1640] Got to reveal it to those who wrote it down.
[time=1643] It was inspired by him every single word.
[time=1645] And lastly, just for a minute, talk about this, this word is preservation.
[time=1649] My faith goes far enough, dear friends, to believe that God can inspire his word, breathe it out to those brave folks throughout the ages who wrote down what we called the Bible.
[time=1661] And it can actually be preserved so that I can read it today.
[time=1665] Exactly as it was meant to be read.
[time=1667] My faith goes that far.
[time=1669] I believe that God wanted us to know what Paul said to the church in Ephesus.
[time=1675] So much so that he preserved it across thousands of years.
[time=1679] So I could read it today exactly as it was intended.
[time=1682] And I'll go farther than that, folks.
[time=1684] It seems plain to me from the Scriptures that God understood.
[time=1688] That those letters to the Ephesians, to the Colossians, the churches in Galatia, the church in Rome, and on and on, they were all meant for you.
[time=1697] They were all meant for you.
[time=1701] For Rome first, truly, they were occasional letters.
[time=1705] They were having problems.
[time=1707] But I believe very much that God understood.
[time=1711] I'm glad that I can say that God understood things.
[time=1714] I'm sure he's happy to know that I know he understands things.
[time=1716] Anyway, I'll pass on to you this morning that I believe the whole process was super intended by him in very specific ways.
[time=1726] And that there is nothing at all wrong with what you see in front of you, perhaps on your lap this morning.
[time=1735] Now, friends, I will tell you that it's not a popular thing to say these days.
[time=1739] And I'm comfortable out in that cold air.
[time=1743] I'm comfortable living in that place.
[time=1747] We're going to rally around this morning one verse.
[time=1750] It seems odd.
[time=1751] I told people this week, they were talking, but my topic this morning was the Bible.
[time=1755] And I couldn't think of a thing to say about the Bible.
[time=1758] That's not true.
[time=1760] There's a lot to say about the Bible, but in 30 minutes seems a little daunting.
[time=1764] So I wanted to land on one verse and try to do it justice.
[time=1767] And that verse to your friends is Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12.
[time=1771] There's a familiar verse to many of you.
[time=1773] I want to encourage you with these words this morning.
[time=1777] There's an outline in your bulletins.
[time=1779] If you'd like to follow along there, it's a very full outline.
[time=1781] There's lots and lots of scripture in that outline.
[time=1784] You heard Dave a few minutes ago read from Psalm 119.
[time=1787] I believe it has 176 verses.
[time=1790] And every single verse of Psalm 119 mentions the Word of God.
[time=1795] Take a look.
[time=1796] You can flip through sometime and just check it out.
[time=1798] Ordinances, ways, laws, decrees.
[time=1802] Every verse of that extensive Psalm mentions the Word of God.
[time=1807] I want to take special care of this morning friends to listen to God's Word.
[time=1811] Again, talk about itself.
[time=1813] What is the Word of God's conviction about itself?
[time=1817] Does what I believe?
[time=1819] Does what I say come into alignment with what God's Word says about itself?
[time=1825] It has a very, very, no surprise to you perhaps.
[time=1828] A very high view of itself.
[time=1831] Our culture, we spent lots of time on this series in weeks past Untouchables.
[time=1837] Talk about what culture says, what God's Word says.
[time=1840] There is a vast difference.
[time=1843] A vast difference.
[time=1844] Look at Hebrews 4, 12, with me as we begin.
[time=1848] For the Word of God is living an active, sharper than any two edged sword, piercing to the
[time=1857] division of soul and spirit of joints and of marrow and discerning the thoughts and intentions
[time=1866] of the heart.
[time=1868] Living translation begins that the Word of God is alive and powerful.
[time=1873] It's a good translation.
[time=1875] In fact, in the original language, the first Word in Hebrews 4, 12 is living.
[time=1881] The author of Hebrews can't help himself living the Word of God and active and powerful.
[time=1887] There are three ways the phrase Word of God is used in the New Testament.
[time=1891] The first one is with regard to the person of Jesus as in John chapter 1, Revelation 19.
[time=1897] The name was the Word of God of Jesus.
[time=1900] It's also used of God's creative agency as he made the universe.
[time=1904] That God spoke it by the Word of God.
[time=1906] It says the heavens were made.
[time=1909] The third and by far the most frequent way is the way you see it here in Hebrews 4, 12.
[time=1913] What we would call the Bible.
[time=1915] Scripture.
[time=1917] Holy writ.
[time=1918] What God has said to us and contained.
[time=1921] And the Word Bible comes from the Greek word for book Bibloss.
[time=1925] That's what that word comes from.
[time=1927] And the Bible is a book but not merely a book.
[time=1931] Amen to that.
[time=1933] In your outline, Roman number one was focused on that first set of words there in Hebrews 4, 12.
[time=1939] The Word of God is living and active.
[time=1942] That Word active there, living and active.
[time=1944] The Word active in the Greek is an air-gase.
[time=1947] It sounds like the Word energy.
[time=1950] It's the Word from which we get the Word energy.
[time=1952] God's Word is living and active.
[time=1954] Is that how culture approaches, how our culture approaches the Word of God?
[time=1961] I was asking that question of you folks.
[time=1963] Is that how our culture in your experience approaches the Word of God, living and active?
[time=1969] When we see a division, friends, when there's a breakdown between what was being said about the Bible, what the Bible says about itself, we have a choice to make.
[time=1977] And my encouragement to you would be to come into alignment with what the Bible says about itself.
[time=1982] Look at Psalm 119 with me again in those first eight verses of this marvelous, extensive Psalm.
[time=1989] You might have seen your Bibles.
[time=1991] There's little letters there.
[time=1993] Oliph, Beit, Gimmel, Dalit.
[time=1995] Those are the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.
[time=1998] And every section of Psalm 119 in the Hebrew begins with the first letter.
[time=2003] So the first letter with the first letter for section, second section with Beit, third, with Gimmel.
[time=2009] It's a beautiful expression, friends, of God's creative power.
[time=2013] That God can do this incredible thing.
[time=2018] Okay.
[time=2020] God's word, friends, is living and active.
[time=2024] What does that mean?
[time=2025] It means letter A in your outlines.
[time=2027] It results in obedience.
[time=2030] Listen to what Psalm 119 says about that.
[time=2033] Listen to how there's a connection being made.
[time=2035] Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of the Lord.
[time=2041] Blessed are those who keep his testimonies, who seek him with their whole heart, who also do no wrong, but walk in his ways.
[time=2050] Friends, God's word is a very high calling.
[time=2053] I think about Ephesians 2, 8, 9.
[time=2055] For it's probably gracefully saved through faith.
[time=2057] It's not of yourself.
[time=2058] It's the gift of God.
[time=2059] And then we have that marvelous verse, Ephesians 2, 10.
[time=2063] For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works.
[time=2069] He enables us to do what his word says in the way that only he can, because God's word, friends, is very, very high expectations of us.
[time=2077] In fact, so high that I cannot do it on my own, which is an evidence of its living, active,
[time=2084] dynamic power.
[time=2085] I'll let you think of that for just a minute.
[time=2088] You have commanded verse 4.
[time=2090] You have commanded your precepts to be kept diligently.
[time=2094] I can't do that.
[time=2095] That's where the grace of God comes in when I fail, when I fall short.
[time=2101] Oh, that my ways may be steadfast in keeping your statutes.
[time=2106] Do you ever pray to scriptures, friends?
[time=2109] If you don't, I would encourage you at least to let your prayers be guided by the scriptures.
[time=2115] Oh, that my ways may be steadfast in keeping your statutes.
[time=2119] I don't feel steadfast much of the time.
[time=2121] I need his help.
[time=2123] Then I shall not be put to shame.
[time=2125] Verse 6, having my eyes fixed on all your commandments.
[time=2129] 1 Peter 1 also talks about that God's word is living and active because it can empower my obedience
[time=2135] and my life today.
[time=2136] 1 Peter 1 verses 23-25.
[time=2138] It's a remarkable passage.
[time=2141] Verse 22 says, having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth.
[time=2146] Buy your obedience to the truth.
[time=2148] It's connected.
[time=2151] My obedience to the truth is tied to the living and abiding word of God in the next verse.
[time=2157] For a sincerely, brotherly love, loved one another earnestly from a pure heart since you have been born again,
[time=2163] not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God.
[time=2170] For all flesh, this is from Isaiah chapter 40, your Bible probably says that.
[time=2174] For all flesh is like grass.
[time=2176] And all its glory, like the flower of grass.
[time=2179] The grass where there's the flower falls.
[time=2181] The word of the Lord remains forever.
[time=2184] Listen to this, verse 25.
[time=2186] And this word is the good news that was preached to you.
[time=2192] Peter says that the word, quoting Isaiah 40, that the word from God, Isaiah, thus says the Lord.
[time=2200] He equates the good news of the gospel in the middle of the first century with the prophet Isaiah, the law of Moses.
[time=2208] This word is the good news that was preached to you.
[time=2211] What is the Bible's conviction about itself?
[time=2213] Is it a collection of interesting ancient historical documents that have no connection to our lives today?
[time=2218] That's not how Peter thought about it.
[time=2220] Peter saw the gospel, listen friends, this is very, very important.
[time=2224] Peter saw the gospel as a seamless continuation of God's Old Testament revelation of himself.
[time=2230] The most consistent picture in the Bible of itself is the Bible is God's divine self-disclosure.
[time=2238] God making himself known to you.
[time=2240] I've told you guys that before.
[time=2241] I believe it's still true today.
[time=2243] There's nothing in the Bible off limits to me if I read it in that way.
[time=2248] If the Bible from start to finish, all of those books are about God disclosing himself to me,
[time=2254] but nothing in it is like, well, I guess if you want to, if it works for you.
[time=2261] But the Bible is God's unique, authoritative disclosure of his heart, his mind, of his intentions for our lives.
[time=2272] Do you approach it that way or is it good advice about your marriage?
[time=2278] It's good advice about parenting.
[time=2280] It's good advice about how to do your job.
[time=2282] Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
[time=2284] It's all right.
[time=2285] It's not how the Bible believes it.
[time=2286] That's not how the Bible speaks and thinks about itself.
[time=2289] I want to encourage you with that this morning.
[time=2291] William Barkley said that it's one of the facts of history that wherever men have taken God's word seriously, things have begun to happen.
[time=2298] It's true.
[time=2301] God's word is living in active friends, let her be, and that it will last forever.
[time=2305] It's not tied to one people in one place in one time.
[time=2309] It will last forever when the earth fades away.
[time=2312] The earth, God's word will remain.
[time=2315] It will remain steadfast.
[time=2317] Jesus said, "Heaven, an earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away." Do you believe him?
[time=2323] He said, "I am the resurrection and the life.
[time=2326] He who believes in me will live even though he dies.
[time=2330] That will always be true.
[time=2332] It will never not be true.
[time=2334] It will be true when the earth dissolves as the hymn says like snow.
[time=2339] The sun for bear to shine.
[time=2343] It will still be true.
[time=2345] It will last forever.
[time=2347] It is living in an executive and it will always be so.
[time=2350] Throughout the Eternities.
[time=2352] Psalm 119 again says this, "Forever, O Lord, by your word is firmly fixed in the heavens."
[time=2361] Know what that word forever means in the Hebrew?
[time=2364] It means forever.
[time=2370] Your faithfulness endures to all generations, including ours.
[time=2376] You have established the earth and it stands fast.
[time=2380] By your appointment, they stand this day for all things are your servants.
[time=2385] If your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction.
[time=2391] Wow.
[time=2393] I will never forget you, precepts.
[time=2395] For by them you have given me life.
[time=2397] I am yours.
[time=2399] Save me, for I have sought your precepts." That's good, Isaiah 40 for a minute.
[time=2405] And look at the passage that Peter was quoting from.
[time=2408] God has commissioned Isaiah to go and speak a message to the people.
[time=2413] And it's not a very popular message.
[time=2416] It rarely was for the prophets.
[time=2418] In fact, to speak prophetically is often to speak a hard, truthful message.
[time=2424] That's what it means.
[time=2426] It can't mean to tell the future, but it often means a hard message in the present time to people who didn't want to hear it.
[time=2433] For example, Isaiah 40 verse 6, a voice says cry that is cry out.
[time=2439] And as Isaiah said, what shall I cry?
[time=2443] And here is what God tells Isaiah to say to the people.
[time=2446] All flesh is grass.
[time=2449] How appropriate analogy for today.
[time=2454] The grass in my backyard is some color of brown I've never quite seen before.
[time=2459] Those rain falling softly last night and just waiting for it.
[time=2462] Like every second waiting for the rain to fall.
[time=2464] All its beauty is like the flower of the field.
[time=2466] The grass withers.
[time=2468] [AMEN] The flower fades when the breath of the Lord blows on it.
[time=2473] Surely the people are grass.
[time=2477] The people of Israel and Isaiah's day were living in a time of incredible prosperity.
[time=2482] And their kings were wayward.
[time=2484] And their kings were not focused on the right things.
[time=2487] And they were experiencing this time of incredible again, prosperity and success.
[time=2492] And it threatened their spiritual vitality.
[time=2495] I'll say that again.
[time=2497] The people of Israel living in a time of incredible economic prosperity.
[time=2500] And that prosperity threatened their spiritual vitality.
[time=2505] All this stuff you see, Isaiah says it's grass.
[time=2508] It will wither.
[time=2509] It will fade.
[time=2510] It will fall.
[time=2511] People didn't want to hear that.
[time=2514] We don't want to hear that.
[time=2517] We want to have this everlasting legacy and all these different things friends.
[time=2522] Last week I was talking about First Peter over at Brookside about a living hope that will
[time=2529] never fade away unlike my 401k.
[time=2531] It will never fade away.
[time=2533] It will never be reduced.
[time=2535] It's not subject to markets or mismanagement or any of it.
[time=2541] And the Word of God's promises friends are just like that.
[time=2546] Just like that.
[time=2547] Word of God let her see in your outlines is effective.
[time=2551] The Word of God results in obedience.
[time=2553] It informs our obedience day by day by day.
[time=2558] It will last forever and let her see lastly the first point.
[time=2561] It's effective.
[time=2563] Let's go to Isaiah 55 on that front.
[time=2566] Isaiah 55.
[time=2567] These are familiar verses to you.
[time=2572] Verses that we need to hear today, especially today, on in the middle of a drought.
[time=2578] For as the rain, it says in verse 10, Isaiah 55, "As the rain and snow come down from heaven, so I am told, Lord, and do not return there, but water the earth, making it bring forth
[time=2591] throughout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so shall my word be."
[time=2600] That goes out from my mouth.
[time=2602] It shall not return to me empty.
[time=2606] It shall accomplish that which I purpose and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.
[time=2613] I can remember many moons ago in March.
[time=2617] It rained a lot.
[time=2619] I had to mow my grass like every four days.
[time=2621] I had to mow my grass in four weeks now.
[time=2624] So think about March and how luxurious and green my grass was and all those things.
[time=2631] Kind of came a little early, if you remember.
[time=2634] That's what God's word is like.
[time=2636] It results in this incredible dynamic growth.
[time=2639] Why?
[time=2640] It's living and it's active and it's powerful and it's effective.
[time=2643] It will do exactly what it's supposed to do.
[time=2646] And if you spend time with it, you will never walk away from God's word saying.
[time=2652] I just didn't do it for me.
[time=2655] If you are there and you are reading it as it was read, as it was given to us in the first place, God's word is dynamic, friends.
[time=2664] It will always do what it's supposed to do.
[time=2666] This first does not mean that people can use God's word for all kinds of untoward things and it will work no matter what.
[time=2673] If God's word will always do what it sets out to do.
[time=2677] Afflict you, comfort you, whatever it happens to be.
[time=2682] Whatever it happens to be.
[time=2684] I said in the first hour, and I'll say it again for the first time with you folks, that God's word will mess with you.
[time=2691] It will just mess with you, which goes into the point two in the outline, that God's word is piercing and discerning, it's uncomfortable.
[time=2702] Look back at Hebrews 4-12 with me.
[time=2707] Sharper than a two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, and I don't have time to go into soul and spirit, but everything has a soul that Sukkai is the word in the Greek, but not everything has a spirit.
[time=2720] What's the point of the author of Hebrews in this verse, that it gets right down there to the innermost part of who you are, and it lays it out.
[time=2729] It's a spiritual dissection going on.
[time=2733] That's not fun.
[time=2736] I like the thoughts and intentions of my heart to remain secret sometimes, hidden from people,
[time=2744] and God's word lays them bare, and that's uncomfortable.
[time=2750] In chapter A, it's piercing and discerning friends, and it's judgment, and it's judgment.
[time=2759] Look at Jeremiah 23 with me.
[time=2761] Jeremiah was referred to as the weeping prophet.
[time=2764] Talk about piercing.
[time=2766] He was the weeping prophet because God sent him to give a message to Jerusalem.
[time=2770] It was going to be destroyed if it did not repent.
[time=2775] So he was known, he was thrown into cisterns, he was tortured.
[time=2780] The scriptures have filled up with examples of people who have suffered for the word of God and nobody, perhaps more so than Jeremiah.
[time=2788] It's not my word like fire declares the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces.
[time=2797] Psalm 119, 120 says, "My flesh trembles for fear of you, and I am afraid of your judgments."
[time=2804] Friends, God's word is a fearful thing.
[time=2809] It is a fearful thing.
[time=2812] Someone referred to preachers who are reckless with the Bible like a baby with power tools.
[time=2819] Once, I can remember that very vividly, and it's true.
[time=2822] What you see in God's word, friends, is fearsome.
[time=2826] It is fearsome in the best sense of the word, and it's why sometimes we don't want to read it, because we know that by reading it, we will invite God's sword, Ephesians 6, the sword of God's word to cut the deepest parts of who we are and expose my intentions.
[time=2845] God's word is piercing and discerning in its judgment.
[time=2848] It brings this to bear in my life.
[time=2851] Let her be, it's piercing and discerning in its steadfastness.
[time=2856] It's steadfastness.
[time=2860] It's never going to stop.
[time=2862] Look with me at 2 Peter, chapter 3.
[time=2865] I am astonished by this passage, again, by Peter in the 50s.
[time=2869] In the middle of the first century, this is his conviction about the Bible.
[time=2873] If you're any New Testament scholar, they will tell you that what these folks said,
[time=2880] and when they said it, is crucially important.
[time=2883] The Da Vinci Code and its legacy is a sad one in biblical scholarship.
[time=2888] That these things are pushed back in centuries after they actually happened.
[time=2891] I want you to hear the words of Peter in the middle of the first century about the letters of Paul.
[time=2898] This is from, this is a New Testament, friends, I can't wait to read it with you.
[time=2901] Look at 2 Peter, chapter 3, verses 14 through 18.
[time=2904] What do we believe about God's word?
[time=2906] I wanted this morning just to let you hear what God's word says, again, about itself.
[time=2912] It's not an exhaustive list, but hear Peter's words by the Holy Spirit here.
[time=2917] Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these, this God's return and the summing up of all things in Christ,
[time=2925] be diligent to be found by him without spot or blemish and that peace.
[time=2930] And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you
[time=2937] according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks of them in them of these matters.
[time=2943] There are some things in them that are hard to understand, even for Peter, and certainly for me too,
[time=2950] which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction as they do the other scriptures.
[time=2959] Do you see that?
[time=2961] Peter says that Paul's letters are scripture, and that word is used in New Testament friends
[time=2967] about every part of the Old Testament, every part of it.
[time=2970] You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, take care that you are not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability.
[time=2981] Devotion to God's word caused us to be stable, to be steadfast when the winds blow,
[time=2988] but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be the glory, both now and the day of eternity, amen.
[time=2998] The scriptures, Peter says that Paul's letter to Ephesus is scripture just like Isaiah, the law of Moses, the Psalms.
[time=3009] That is a very powerful conviction, friends, and that flies in the face of modern scholarships
[time=3015] disdain for the Bible as a haphazard collection of somebody's random thoughts about things.
[time=3020] The Bible does not bear that out at all.
[time=3024] I'm so happy to tell you that this morning. It's trustworthy.
[time=3028] In every one of Shakespeare's plays, there are parts missing that fundamentally affect the outcome of the play.
[time=3037] Did you know that?
[time=3039] 39 plays or so.
[time=3041] Every one of them.
[time=3042] And in 1947, some Bedouin shepherds found the dead seas scrolls in a cave,
[time=3048] and there were more changes in the life of the tribe than there were to the text of the Old Testament having found that copy.
[time=3056] Did you hear me say that?
[time=3059] We had manuscript copies of the Old Testament that were about 1,000 years ahead of the documents that they found,
[time=3065] and the 1,000 year gap between copies of the Old Testament does not one change.
[time=3070] Can you imagine that?
[time=3072] The Isaiah scroll, if you rolled it out, it's like 55 feet long.
[time=3077] And there's not one word in the Isaiah scroll that's different.
[time=3081] That's a miracle.
[time=3085] God's words preservation throughout the ages.
[time=3089] It resulted in more changes in the life of the tribe than the text of the Old Testament.
[time=3094] It's miraculous.
[time=3095] God's word is piercing and discerning friends in its exposure.
[time=3100] Its exposure, letter C.
[time=3104] Proverbs 26.
[time=3106] Go there with me. Proverbs 26.
[time=3110] Again, God's word will mess with you.
[time=3114] It will not let you be comfortable.
[time=3116] It will let you, for example, make Jesus out to be this wandering preacher poet figure who said things like,
[time=3122] "Look at the flowers of the field." It covers above the ground, like about 5 feet.
[time=3127] It never messes with anybody.
[time=3128] If you read the Bible, read the Gospel of Mark in 45 minutes sometime this week, and you will see in the Gospel of Mark that he messes with people everywhere he goes.
[time=3138] They want to kill him.
[time=3139] They want to kill him friends early in Mark's Gospel.
[time=3142] Early.
[time=3143] Because he upset their whole authority structure.
[time=3147] They wanted to kill him.
[time=3149] I don't want to kill a guy to look at the flowers of the field.
[time=3151] He's no threat to me.
[time=3152] A wandering preacher poet.
[time=3154] He's interesting, perhaps a little strange, but no threat to me.
[time=3161] Proverbs 26 verse 22.
[time=3163] The words of a whisper are like delicious morsels.
[time=3166] They go down to the inner parts of the body.
[time=3168] Like the glaze covering an earthen vessel are fervent lips with an evil heart.
[time=3175] So God's word exposes this duplicity, this two-faced nest.
[time=3180] Whoever hates disguises himself with his lips and harbors deceit in his heart.
[time=3185] When he speaks graciously, believe him not, for there are seven abominations in his heart.
[time=3191] God's word will mess with you.
[time=3194] I love to sing after we hear from the word of God.
[time=3197] We're going to sing again this morning as the band comes.
[time=3199] I want to give you some recommendations for things to read.
[time=3202] All of these quotes, all of these books will be in digging deeper, published Wednesday afternoon, late afternoon sometime.
[time=3208] So I want to direct you there to our church website again and look at the digging deeper document.
[time=3212] And all these book recommendations will be there as well as all of these quotes.
[time=3217] And even more that I've used today.
[time=3219] Some books to write down if I could trouble you with three things to write down today.
[time=3222] Books about the Bible that I found terribly helpful.
[time=3226] Philip Yancey wrote a book called "The Bible Jesus Read." And it's a book about the way that Christ and his followers talked about the Old Testament.
[time=3234] "The Bible Jesus Read" by Philip Yancey.
[time=3237] I would encourage you also a book called "How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth" by Gordon Fee and Doug Stewart.
[time=3244] Tremendous resource regarding, again, what the Bible says about itself.
[time=3249] And lastly, mentioned here before together, friends, is the Jesus storybook Bible.
[time=3255] I have never, I have not found in recent years a resource that has fostered in me a greater
[time=3261] love for the Word of God outside itself than that resource.
[time=3264] For all ages, it's a children's Bible, but it's for all ages.
[time=3268] If you don't have one in your house, I would encourage you to go get one today.
[time=3272] God, thank you for what you've done today.
[time=3274] Thank you for your Word.
[time=3275] Think of that it's living and that it's active and that it's piercing and it's discerning.
[time=3280] And God, the times that we are most hesitant to go to your Word, the times that we most need to go there, may it be so.
[time=3287] Grow up within this church, Father, a deeper and greater and more profound love for your Word.
[time=3293] And Lord, may we sing now with full hearts, rejoicing at what it is you've done in your
[time=3299] Word.
[time=3300] [AMEN]
[time=3306] Would you stand together and let's sing this song.
[time=3311] Holy words long preserved for our walk in this world.
[time=3320] May you be sound with God's own heart, O let the ancient words impart.
[time=3330] Words of life, words of hope, give us strength, love has grown in this world.
[time=3344] Wherever we roll, ancient words will guide us all.
[time=3352] Ancient words have been true, changing me and changing you.
[time=3362] We have come with open hearts, O let the ancient words impart.
[time=3457] O let the ancient words impart, O let the ancient words impart.
[time=3472] Words of God speak, words of God speak.
[time=3502] Yes, we have come with open hearts, O let the ancient words impart.
[time=3528] [MUSIC]
