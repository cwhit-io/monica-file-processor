[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - You guys don't know how revolutionary it is that John Such has an iPad with him this morning.
[time=38] None of you will be shocked by that, but me, but it is incredible that he has that.
[time=42] So I can read the Bible from my iPhone if he can use an iPad this morning.
[time=47] John Such is here with us today.
[time=49] My topic last week was the Bible.
[time=52] John's today is God.
[time=54] So I'm not sure which one of us got hosed more, John.
[time=56] I guess we'll find out.
[time=58] John was my pastor for about four years at Wallen Baptist Church.
[time=64] I have never known a more passionate defender of the church.
[time=69] You hear him talk about that in just a minute this morning, than John.
[time=73] I've never known a more skilled defender of the church and a more skilled expositor of his word in one person as my friend, than John.
[time=83] In fact, the two men on the front row down here, Kelly and John have met more to me as pastors than anybody else has ever known in my life.
[time=90] And so it is my great, great joy this morning.
[time=93] The notes down front say that John is our guest of honor.
[time=97] I couldn't agree more.
[time=98] Would you please, blackuck ministries, please welcome this morning, Pastor John Such.
[time=114] My response to that is that you need to get out more, Steve.
[time=119] If you think I'm all that and a box of crackers too, you never know.
[time=125] I don't do this very often.
[time=127] Basically, I got to get my stuff stuck.
[time=130] You just talk amongst yourself, I organize.
[time=133] Just do that.
[time=138] I hardly ever leave our church.
[time=140] I preach there about 47 weeks out of the year.
[time=145] So for me to not be there is very unusual.
[time=149] So I am a fish out of water.
[time=153] Rod and Lori, what an honor.
[time=156] I never met you.
[time=158] Here's my opinion about missionaries.
[time=160] Well, just everyone else.
[time=161] I'm just going to talk to Rod and Lori for a minute if you don't mind.
[time=165] We send the varsity to the mission field.
[time=167] The J.V. stays home.
[time=170] That's how it should work, shouldn't it?
[time=173] We send the varsity in the book of Acts.
[time=176] Whenever a missions job was done, they would go, "Hey, where's Paul?
[time=180] Who's the best player on our team?" He needs to go do that job.
[time=184] So it's an honor to be in your presence.
[time=187] Keep it up.
[time=188] Get going.
[time=189] And maybe someday I'll get to be on the varsity team.
[time=191] I've been on the J.V. for a long time, let me tell you.
[time=194] All I want to ever be was on the varsity.
[time=196] I don't know that I'm going to ever get there.
[time=198] But stay at it.
[time=201] I want to give you my connection to blackout because most of you don't know me.
[time=206] I've been gone a long time.
[time=208] So long I have mold growing on me.
[time=211] And most of you don't know I have a clue who I am.
[time=214] So I'm going to give you a brief history because, be honest with you, this is my church.
[time=219] This is my place.
[time=222] This is my home.
[time=225] I've been at wall in almost 25 years, which for some of you remember me flying out the back door because I can't believe that.
[time=233] But Blackhawk was the place for Amy and I that changed our lives.
[time=240] Blackhawk was the place that introduced us to Christ, taught us how to follow him, trained us how to minister for him, and then stuck a foot in our back and said, now get out of here and go do something.
[time=254] And that's what this place has been for us.
[time=258] Easter Sunday, 1978, Amy was my girlfriend.
[time=264] We went to New Haven High School.
[time=266] She had just been a part of youth group here at Blackhawk and really got her faith all put together.
[time=272] And then she started pushing on me, saying you need to wake up because you're a chump.
[time=280] And I can't use the words she would have really said, and said you need to get your life together.
[time=287] And she started loving me to Christ and she drug me to this Baptist church.
[time=292] And I'd never been in one of those.
[time=294] I thought it was a very strange place because they dunked people in water.
[time=299] That was my perspective.
[time=301] I would drive by here on State Street and go, that's the place where they dunk people.
[time=306] What a weird place that is, you know?
[time=310] So on Easter Sunday, 1978, over in the Convocation Center, Dave Jeremiah did his thing, and then we always did.
[time=322] I didn't know what it was, but we sang all seven verses of just as I am.
[time=326] And about verse three, I wandered down to the front and someone, Rick Hawks, met me there.
[time=332] He was the youth pastor and said, why have you come forward?
[time=334] And I said, I have no idea.
[time=338] I didn't know anything about this church thing.
[time=341] I was as green and rookie as you can be.
[time=343] I didn't know what to say.
[time=345] I didn't know the rules.
[time=346] I didn't know the language.
[time=347] I didn't know how to behave.
[time=348] I didn't own a tie, okay?
[time=351] I didn't own one.
[time=352] The first time I ever bought a tie was an evangelism explosion because they made me look like a Mormon missionary going out in the streets of Fort Wayne.
[time=363] Anyhow, I gave my life to Christ that day and nothing's been the same.
[time=370] We put that picture up for me, please.
[time=373] Here is the reality of what I was.
[time=376] I apologize that hairstyle is a little bit out.
[time=379] I'd love to have all that hair, though.
[time=381] I got that part.
[time=382] Read the caption above my picture slowly.
[time=387] Did you get it?
[time=389] This was in the youth group newspaper at Black Hawk in 1978.
[time=397] It was the '70s, and I was from New Haven, okay?
[time=401] So that, Rick Hawks came to me horrifying, says, John, we left school out.
[time=409] It's supposed to say a high school senior, and it just says a high senior.
[time=423] I didn't get what the problem was.
[time=427] I started drinking when I was 12 years old.
[time=429] I started binge drinking at 12 years old from 12 to the time that became a reality in my life.
[time=435] I did four years of college and two years of high school.
[time=440] A high senior, that makes sense to me.
[time=443] I wasn't offended.
[time=444] You're just telling it the way it was.
[time=446] God rescued my life there.
[time=450] From almost the moment that I gave my life to Christ, I started following hawks around.
[time=457] What are you doing today?
[time=458] Washing my car.
[time=459] Can I help?
[time=460] Painting the basketball goals, can I do that?
[time=465] I followed him around.
[time=466] If he'd been a Mormon, I'd be a Mormon today.
[time=469] If he was charismatic, I'd be speaking in tongues to you this morning.
[time=472] Whatever he did, I just followed him.
[time=474] Now, please take that down because it's irritating me.
[time=479] Thank you.
[time=481] That was painful.
[time=485] A little bit after that time in a Sunday evening service, Dave Jeremiah gave this message.
[time=490] I don't know if any of you are here when Dave spoke on Sunday nights, but he preached forever.
[time=496] He'd talk an hour about Moses and we're all like, "Dave, come on, man." In the middle of one of those, he said, "Who here would like to go in the full-time ministry?" Before he was done asking the question, I was on my feet.
[time=510] What was interesting is Amy was on hers right next to me.
[time=514] That started our journey off the ministry.
[time=516] Rick said, "Do you need to go learn a little bit about the Bible?" I said, "Oh, is that a prerequisite to do in this?" I had two choices.
[time=525] We narrowed it down to Moody Bible Institute or Cedarville University.
[time=529] I chose Cedarville for a very spiritual reason.
[time=531] They had a baseball team.
[time=533] Moody did not have a baseball team, so I wandered off to Cedarville.
[time=536] After four years, there's more to that story than I won't go into.
[time=540] Blackhawk invited me back to be on their staff.
[time=543] The history of this church in the early '80s, the whole city of Fort Wayne, we thought they were going to flip the lights out and call it dead.
[time=550] Our church here went through a really tough time.
[time=553] We went from a staff about 11 to a staff of about three if my memory serves.
[time=558] One of those was a counselor who had to pay his own way.
[time=561] I know there was Steve and Rick and George Lantman and Edward.
[time=566] You guys don't care about that, Steve and I are reminiscing together.
[time=569] Also, I come back as a part of the rebuilding thing and was the youth pastor.
[time=575] I really wasn't very good at it, didn't know what I was doing.
[time=578] I was just kind of here.
[time=579] I always say the reason I got the job is they couldn't afford to pay somebody who knew what they were doing.
[time=584] They got me.
[time=585] That's really true.
[time=586] That's not a made up story.
[time=588] I've got youth stories, man.
[time=591] The old school buses, those tan school buses that we had, 70 junior hires and I were broken down in a place called McClure, Ohio.
[time=602] McClure, Ohio is the radish capital of the world.
[time=606] And the reason I know that is it was on the sign as you came into town.
[time=611] Radish kept, really?
[time=614] I don't know.
[time=616] 70 junior hires and me and Barney Fife came by and fixed the bus for us, the local guy and got us out of town.
[time=623] It was a beautiful thing to be a Mayberry at that moment.
[time=627] I spent four hours in a McDonald's in South Bend with 50 junior hires.
[time=633] And beloved, I want you to know that Doctrine of Purgatory is real.
[time=636] I have been there.
[time=639] Our bus broke down.
[time=641] The air breaks froze and I was stuck for four and a half hours in McDonald's with 50 junior hires.
[time=647] I deserved a raise.
[time=649] No doubt about it.
[time=651] One of my favorite stories, we do lock-ins.
[time=653] Anything we could do to help kids find Christ, we'd try anything.
[time=657] And the thing I love about this church, by the way, it'll try stuff.
[time=661] You won't always get it right.
[time=663] Let's do this.
[time=664] Let's try and see if we can figure out is there another way to tell our neighbor and so on.
[time=669] Lock-in means that I'm locked in with junior high kids all night long.
[time=673] I don't remember how many kids, they were just all over the place.
[time=676] And this one kid was the most obnoxious of all junior hire kids that were there that night.
[time=681] And that is working at it.
[time=683] To be the most obnoxious junior high kid in a group that size is really working at it.
[time=688] And we all wish that we could just drop him, you know.
[time=692] About seven in the morning, I'm in the kitchen helping fix breakfast.
[time=695] The parents are clean up breakfast.
[time=697] The parents are coming home and in watch the obnoxious kid, blood is gushing from his face.
[time=703] Some other kid had had enough and he dropped him right there in the foyer.
[time=707] Pow.
[time=710] I did not discipline that young man.
[time=715] At all.
[time=717] Thank you.
[time=718] God bless you.
[time=720] Here's some money.
[time=721] Thanks for taking care of that.
[time=724] Had a lot of fun.
[time=725] I wasn't the greatest youth pastor in the world.
[time=728] But I tried hard and we had some good times.
[time=732] And I run into kids that are part of that youth group to this day.
[time=736] Some of them doing well, some of them doing poorly as far as their faith goes.
[time=741] In 1988, actually December 1 of '87, this church sent to some degree Amy and I out to the
[time=752] northwest side of Fort Wayne de Wallen.
[time=754] It was a church of about 30 people really struggling, having a difficult time.
[time=759] And I just wanted to do this preacher thing.
[time=762] I didn't think I'd really be good at it.
[time=764] I just felt like I was supposed to do it.
[time=767] And Rick said, "I think you should." And off I went.
[time=769] And Blackhawk cared enough about us that they went to this little struggling church and said, "We'll pay their salary if you want us to." How's that?
[time=782] The infinite wisdom of the 20-some people, 30 people at Wallen, they said no.
[time=789] So for the $12,000, I beat down on parsonage and all the produce, and I'm not making this
[time=795] up, from their gardens we took the job at Wallen, which would have been helpful if I ate anything
[time=801] out of a garden, but I don't.
[time=805] And so unless you're growing little debbies out there, I got nothing.
[time=809] That's of no value to me at all.
[time=816] But this place has meant the world to us.
[time=821] And we root for you to be a great church.
[time=826] We're in the same community doing the same stuff, and it may look a little different and sound a little different.
[time=831] I got a tie on because I always wear ties.
[time=833] And you guys don't wear ties, and that's cool.
[time=835] I'm kind of like your style better than ours.
[time=837] But it's not that big a deal, is it?
[time=841] And so Kelly and I are friends, and I want him to be great, and I want Black Hawk to be phenomenal, and I'll be honest with you, all I ever wanted Wallen to be was to become
[time=854] like Black Hawk.
[time=857] And if our church could be like this church, we'd be something.
[time=865] Because I remember this church.
[time=868] I remember when someone went in the hospital and someone, everybody at part of you knew
[time=874] it was Black Hawk time because there were so many people who loved and cared.
[time=878] It was like an Amish person was in the surgery or something.
[time=882] You see all the Amish folks?
[time=884] That's how it was at Black.
[time=885] And I thought, oh, if we could just have a church that cared like that, that loved like that, wouldn't it be something?
[time=892] And I'm not sure we're there or ever will be, but I got to tell you, you're part of a
[time=899] great place.
[time=901] Even this morning, one of the elders walked up to Kelly and said, hey, a young man just
[time=908] gave his life to Christ in the New Believer's class right here today.
[time=912] Is that allowed?
[time=915] [APPLAUSE]
[time=921] Okay, I'm done.
[time=922] I've never gotten applause before while I was preaching.
[time=924] I'm never in my life.
[time=927] If you do the wave, I will retire.
[time=930] [laughter] Long break.
[time=935] You mean now, too, don't you, Steve?
[time=939] Three things I learned at Black Hawk that have served me well my whole life.
[time=942] Actually, there were more than three.
[time=943] Let me boil them down into three and give them to you.
[time=945] Maybe they'll help you.
[time=947] I know they want you to have these three things.
[time=950] Number one, they taught me to believe the Bible.
[time=952] I'd been a part of Christianity.
[time=954] I was raised Romanian Orthodox, and the Orthodox Church has a lot of Bible, and I just didn't
[time=961] know it.
[time=962] No one told me it was the Bible.
[time=963] I mean, we did the liturgy thing.
[time=964] I'd go back and read it and I'd go, that's not bad.
[time=967] Actually, that's really good.
[time=970] But nobody told me it was the Bible.
[time=972] I was just going to page 42 and they said, I was just doing the religion thing.
[time=978] Here, the Bible was expected to be understood and lived.
[time=983] Who would ever think of that?
[time=986] I was blown away.
[time=989] Second, they taught me to trust God when I didn't understand.
[time=994] Believe in Him even when you can't put all the pieces together.
[time=998] When you can't solve all the conundrums that life brings, it doesn't mean He's still not
[time=1005] there.
[time=1006] That's good advice.
[time=1008] And you know what the third one was?
[time=1010] They taught me to care if my neighbor had number one and number two.
[time=1017] This church taught me to care whether my neighbor believed the Bible and whether my neighbor trusted
[time=1023] God.
[time=1029] And if my neighbor didn't, it was a part of my responsibility to figure out how to help my neighbor be number one and number two.
[time=1033] And I am forever indebted to this ministry for that.
[time=1036] Forever.
[time=1039] It's a great church.
[time=1042] I'm glad you're part of it.
[time=1044] Well, I've been assigned the topic of explaining God to you.
[time=1047] I thank Kelly for that marginal responsibility.
[time=1053] And I don't know that I'm going to be able to pull that off, but I hope to help, especially
[time=1060] if you're questioning Him today, and I get it.
[time=1063] There's reasons to question.
[time=1065] When a guy paints his hair red, walks into a movie theater and decides that 12 people don't need to live, and he wished it was more like 70 because he kept shooting him, you have to say.
[time=1077] Was his eye on the sparrow?
[time=1080] Where was he?
[time=1082] I think that's a fair question.
[time=1085] I'm going to give you his answer this morning in a little bit.
[time=1089] You're not going to be very satisfied with it, but it's real.
[time=1095] By the way, our two staffs of our church get together from time to time.
[time=1099] We've been having joint staff meetings.
[time=1101] We've shared missionary endeavors together.
[time=1104] In every shape and form, we are brothers and sisters in Christ.
[time=1109] From Wall and to us, we love you guys.
[time=1113] Go get them.
[time=1114] I hope you fill this thing ten times a Sunday.
[time=1118] If it's okay with you, we'll try to fill ours every chance we can too.
[time=1123] And if that changes this city, so be it.
[time=1128] If it changes one life in this city like it did this morning, that's okay too.
[time=1133] That's okay too.
[time=1136] Well, you want to look at a great good God today?
[time=1139] That's my task, and I hope that you'll enjoy listening to about him.
[time=1146] Would you pray with me?
[time=1148] I always find praying before I teach the Bible to help me.
[time=1151] So if you humor me, that'll help me.
[time=1153] You pray for yourself to be a good listener.
[time=1156] For him who has ears to hear, how about you pray that you have ears to hear what the Spirit says today?
[time=1161] And then I'll pray that the Spirit will speak.
[time=1164] You talk to the Lord a little bit.
[time=1168] Father, thank you for loving us in spite of ourselves, for risking and rewarding us with life when we are rebellious at our core.
[time=1185] I thank you for that man or woman today that gave their life to you.
[time=1191] What a joyous day it is for them, and in your presence, glory is given.
[time=1201] Some of us have known you for a while, and we still take great delight in that.
[time=1207] Help us this morning to embrace, understand you a little bit better, and where our understanding fails may our faith reign.
[time=1220] I pray for these dear friends into the Son of my voice.
[time=1223] May they know your truth.
[time=1225] May that truth give them great liberality on this planet in the face of all kinds of trials.
[time=1232] May your Spirit be our real teacher today.
[time=1237] May we walk out of here empowered and encouraged in our walk.
[time=1244] Father, that's a lot to ask.
[time=1246] That's why we pray.
[time=1248] Can't wait for you to do it.
[time=1250] Let it be so.
[time=1252] [AMEN] The Bible starts out with God.
[time=1256] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning, God.
[time=1260] The story of the Bible is God's story.
[time=1263] It is a revelation of who he is, how he works, what he's made out of, what his character is like, what he likes, what he doesn't like.
[time=1270] There's some passages and there's says, these are some things I hate.
[time=1274] I mean, this book will tell you about him.
[time=1279] Basically, what the Bible does, though, in every page and every verse and every chapter is display his greatness.
[time=1289] It doesn't put it out there as an answer to every problem, but it puts it out there and then says to you, here's this great good God.
[time=1298] What are you going to do with him?
[time=1300] How are you going to respond to him?
[time=1302] What are you going to mean to your life?
[time=1304] Are you going to rebel?
[time=1305] Are you going to submit?
[time=1310] The Bible presents him in chapter 1 as creating.
[time=1315] He's making things.
[time=1318] We like to say it in theology world.
[time=1322] He did it ex nihilo.
[time=1324] It means he spoke it out of nothing.
[time=1327] He didn't take stuff that was already there and connected in ways that hadn't been connected before.
[time=1332] He just said, water.
[time=1335] And there was water.
[time=1337] And he said, light.
[time=1341] There's a lot of debate on how long it took him to do it.
[time=1344] I don't think that's all that important, although I would say this.
[time=1347] Even if you're a seven day literal person, that's me, by the way, just to tip my hand.
[time=1355] My real question is, what took him so long?
[time=1358] Do you think he really needed seven days?
[time=1362] He needed a nanosecond and he could have said, the seven days are for us because he instituted time and gave us a hat to hang time on to define that which he made it out of nothing.
[time=1376] Made it.
[time=1377] I went to New Haven High School.
[time=1380] I'm sorry.
[time=1381] I ain't got no English.
[time=1384] So this great God then, in Genesis 1, is on display as the maker of all things, including human beings, which he, by the way, says are made a little lower than the angels.
[time=1402] You remember the deal you get with evolution if you're a human being?
[time=1406] You're a little more than a what?
[time=1408] You're a little more than a monkey.
[time=1412] In biblical creationism, you're a little lower than the angel.
[time=1416] Take your pick.
[time=1420] You know, once I was a monkey, swinging in a tree, and now I'm a professor with a PhD.
[time=1425] That's how that goes down.
[time=1432] Let's talk about God very quickly.
[time=1434] He is great in his constitutional makeup.
[time=1437] I want to give you seven characteristics of him that display greatness.
[time=1441] We're not going to look up every Bible verse.
[time=1443] I really want to get to the end of this thing earlier than I did last hour.
[time=1446] I don't know if I'm going to pull that off.
[time=1449] People at Wallen bring their lunch with them to church.
[time=1455] Because the line at Cracker Barrel, the Methodist are already there.
[time=1458] They filled up the place.
[time=1459] You're never going to get in.
[time=1463] Okay.
[time=1465] Let me give you seven things.
[time=1466] First, he's eternal.
[time=1469] He doesn't have a beginning or an end.
[time=1471] By the way, this should make you feel more like Kelly's here.
[time=1473] I pull the glasses out.
[time=1474] I was going to put on a step stool so that the cameras wouldn't be shooting the choir loft behind me.
[time=1480] Where's the pastor?
[time=1481] I hear his voice.
[time=1482] I don't see him.
[time=1486] Because this is like a six, seven pulpit.
[time=1490] This is the short one.
[time=1491] I'm really creeped out by that, all right?
[time=1496] But I'm like the shortest guy that's spoken here in a long, long time.
[time=1502] The smartest, but the shortest.
[time=1506] I am not the smartest.
[time=1508] He is eternal.
[time=1509] There was nothing before him.
[time=1511] There's nothing after him.
[time=1512] He predates all that there is.
[time=1513] I can give you passages, Isaiah 57, 15, 1 Timothy chapter 1 verse 17.
[time=1519] And he is forever second.
[time=1523] He is unchanging.
[time=1524] Malachi 3, 6, he says, I do not change.
[time=1528] Imagine that compared to you and I.
[time=1531] There is a God that never changes.
[time=1534] He's always the same.
[time=1536] We're always changing.
[time=1538] We are forever morphing and transcending and growing and regressing and happy and sad.
[time=1546] I mean the whole world is bipolar.
[time=1549] Let's just get it out in the open.
[time=1551] There, it's covered.
[time=1554] He's not.
[time=1557] James chapter 1 verse 17 says, there's no shifting or changing or shadow of turning in him.
[time=1564] And so as he gifts from above, it comes in a constancy that is so reliable.
[time=1572] It's a beautiful thing.
[time=1573] Third, he's omnipresent Psalm 139 verses 7 to 10.
[time=1577] No matter where you go in all this created order, he is there.
[time=1582] If you go to the depths of the ocean, he's there.
[time=1586] When you go to the moon, if you go to the moon and stand on the, he is there.
[time=1591] You can't escape him, that by the way is both comforting and scary, isn't it?
[time=1597] It's scary because there's nowhere to hide.
[time=1601] You think you can go on the closet, close the door, pull the shades, turn out the lights and no one can see and he can see.
[time=1611] But it's also comforting, beloved.
[time=1615] When you are on the gurney about to go into the operating room, he is there.
[time=1623] You with me?
[time=1626] He's omnipresent.
[time=1628] He's also omniscient.
[time=1631] He knows all things.
[time=1634] Corbin referenced Psalm 145 earlier and talked about verse 3.
[time=1640] Verse 5, let's see if I can find this bad boy, in verse 5 of Psalm 145, and I hope we can get in your Bible a little bit because it's way better than I am.
[time=1657] Oh, I said the wrong thing.
[time=1658] What am I doing?
[time=1659] 147 verse 5.
[time=1661] Wow.
[time=1662] Great is our Lord and abundant in strength.
[time=1664] His understanding is infinite.
[time=1667] It has no boundaries.
[time=1669] He knows everything.
[time=1671] That's beautiful.
[time=1672] He's also omnipotent.
[time=1673] That is, he can do all things.
[time=1675] A lot of the music this morning was a great sermon if you're paying attention.
[time=1680] There were songs from Isaiah chapter 40.
[time=1683] There were songs from Romans chapter 8.
[time=1685] There were songs from Romans chapter 11 talking about how awesome and amazing God is.
[time=1691] And when you put these characteristics before you, you're only left to sit back and go, wow.
[time=1698] It stretches the human capacity to calculate, to think about these turns describing anything.
[time=1710] I would suggest to you it is beyond your ability to calculate.
[time=1715] For the words that we use are just earthly handles to help us and God transcends anything that we could ever come up with to describe him.
[time=1727] He's more than that.
[time=1730] Smarter than that.
[time=1732] More powerful than that than on and on.
[time=1736] He's also perfect according to Matthew chapter 5 verse 48, number 6.
[time=1741] And he's infinite according to Psalm 40 verse 5.
[time=1746] These seven characteristics you could add more.
[time=1748] I don't think the list is exhaustive at all.
[time=1750] This topic is so big and so broad.
[time=1753] I just scratched the surface of it for you.
[time=1756] But if you just take these seven things, you would come to this conclusion.
[time=1761] These seven things describe a great being, a great one.
[time=1768] Not a good one.
[time=1773] Having said that, I would suggest to you that this greatness is also seen in the comparison to the people making the assessment of greatness.
[time=1784] That is God, the greatness of God is in his comparison to man.
[time=1790] And so man sees him and as we saw earlier in this Psalm 147 verse 3, or no excuse me, I'm getting all 145 verse 3.
[time=1801] That's what I was doing before.
[time=1803] Great is the Lord and highly to be praised.
[time=1805] His greatness is unsearchable.
[time=1808] We can't fathom it.
[time=1810] That's what we sang earlier from Romans chapter 11 verses 33 that he is undescribable.
[time=1816] We can't comprehend the magnitude of him.
[time=1820] And even if we are a little lower than the angels, he certainly is way above the angels.
[time=1827] And the gap between he and us is significant.
[time=1831] This becomes very important to us when we try to figure out Aurora, Colorado.
[time=1847] Because God didn't look too great about midnight on Thursday, did he?
[time=1853] In fact, he kind of looked like he wasn't paying attention.
[time=1860] But how many of you could tell a story where you sensed the abandonment of this great God
[time=1867] and had to question in yourself and say, what up with that?
[time=1876] Why am I hurting so bad?
[time=1878] Why is cancer now a part of my daily life?
[time=1882] Why did my baby die?
[time=1884] Why did my marriage fall apart?
[time=1888] Where's God at?
[time=1890] Where's this great one who knows everything can do anything?
[time=1893] And yet he sits back.
[time=1899] That's the conundrum for us, isn't it?
[time=1904] Well, this greatness is matched only by a second characteristic of his, and that is that he is good also.
[time=1915] Because it's not hard for someone to be great and be really mean.
[time=1920] We had some of those guys in New Haven too.
[time=1923] You know, the kind of guy that beat up the kid behind the school and stole his milk money?
[time=1927] He was great, but he wasn't very good.
[time=1931] If you go back to most of the mythological God, you know, Roman characters or Greek mythology, they're gods weren't very good, were they?
[time=1939] They're always throwing fire bolts at him and they were great, but they weren't good.
[time=1943] But the Bible proclaims God not just to be this incomprehensible one, but he's also good.
[time=1949] He cares.
[time=1951] It matters to him who would have thought it.
[time=1955] And so he's first good in his character in and of itself.
[time=1958] Again, let me give you seven things and there could be ten more that you would have, but let me just throw a few of these at you that describe him as being good.
[time=1968] Number one, he's holy.
[time=1969] There's no one like him. He's separated from all that is.
[time=1973] And that in itself makes him unique.
[time=1975] He's true, John 17, verse three, holy, by the way, first Peter chapter 1, verses 15 and 16.
[time=1981] He is love, first John 4, 7 to 10.
[time=1987] He's righteous, Psalm 145, 17.
[time=1989] He's faithful.
[time=1993] Peter 4, 19, he's merciful, Ephesians chapter 2, verse 4, and he's kind, Romans 2, 4.
[time=2001] When you put this picture of God together and you say these good things permeate his character
[time=2007] and his greatness and his goodness are meshed together as one where we step back and go,
[time=2013] "Whoa, unbelievable, incomprehensible.
[time=2018] You are," what's the song say, Klaus?
[time=2022] Amazing.
[time=2032] That goodness, by the way, is also seen in the communication that he gives.
[time=2038] This great God didn't have to tell us about himself.
[time=2042] He created things and then offered an explanation of who he was to a degree.
[time=2047] And so when you go outside and you look at the heaven, Psalm 19 says, "They declare the glory of God." And you look up at the sky and you go, "Whoa, I would suggest to you, by the way."
[time=2062] I know science is always poking at our faith and proving that we are fools.
[time=2070] I would suggest to you, science is our friend.
[time=2073] For all they continue to do is to discover how amazing the creator is.
[time=2079] And they just keep laying on layer after layer and they go, "Well, we don't quite understand this, but here's the new discovery." And they go, "Okay, you're just figuring God out." The doctor learned something about the body.
[time=2091] We had a little guy who had surgery this week and they took his appendix and made an escape tube to drain from his bladder.
[time=2099] I'm like, "Who knew? Now we know why the appendix is there." There's a piece of surgical material that nobody knew is needed.
[time=2112] Science is our friend. Don't be afraid of science.
[time=2115] They will never prove God doesn't exist.
[time=2118] The scientists may believe it. I get that.
[time=2122] I even understand why they don't want him to exist.
[time=2126] But at the end of the day, just look in the mirror.
[time=2129] Don't look long because you don't look very good.
[time=2131] But look in the mirror and say, did that just crawl out of a pond?
[time=2139] I didn't say, "Look at your spouse." I said, "Look at yourself." Ladies, ladies and gentlemen, he's climbing.
[time=2147] He's definitely pond scum. I could have told you that before.
[time=2154] The wonder of the Creator is on display at all times.
[time=2158] But that's not the only way he communicated.
[time=2160] It says in Hebrews, chapter 1, verses 1 and 2, that in the former times he communicated in a variety of ways and shadows, giant hands showed up at drinking parties and rode on walls and fire fell from heaven.
[time=2175] And things spoke and whirlwind showed up.
[time=2178] But mostly in the Old Testament, there was silence.
[time=2183] And we all think if a giant hand showed up at a drinking party,
[time=2189] that would really work.
[time=2193] But mostly there was silence.
[time=2196] And by the way, the hand didn't work.
[time=2202] You'd think, "Oh, I got it." If someone rose from the dead and came back, that would work.
[time=2210] And yet the skeptic will find a reason to not believe, won't they?
[time=2215] The proud little lower than an angel guy will rise up and say, "I know better than the Creator." In this passage, in this text, God comes along and he says, "I am the Lord." In these last days, I don't use hands and I don't use dreams anymore.
[time=2236] I speak to you through my Son.
[time=2239] We were in the last days, by the way.
[time=2242] That was ushered in when Jesus showed up.
[time=2245] And then Mr. Webster, Dr. Webster, almost Dr. Webster, last week told you about God's great revelation.
[time=2252] His Bible, I suggested to you earlier when I learned from this church to cherish this book, to try to figure it out.
[time=2258] When I can't figure it out to consider my knowledge to be the problem and not the book's problem.
[time=2265] And this book, God gives you everything you know to be perfect before Him.
[time=2272] Complete for every good work that you would ever want to do on behalf of your Creator is right in here.
[time=2279] And what do we do? I want to know about what's not in here.
[time=2283] I got a few questions about some stuff you didn't tell us about.
[time=2286] Forget it, man.
[time=2288] Go to work on the stuff you do understand.
[time=2295] So God is really good to communicate about Himself.
[time=2298] And number three, God is good in His condescension.
[time=2302] Not a word I would normally use, but I was using C's and I had to come up with one.
[time=2307] You know how that goes.
[time=2308] The Bible was written in a secret code that's all illiterated that preachers mysteriously can find that no one else has a clue how they got there.
[time=2317] But the reality is that God was good when He became a man.
[time=2321] When He sent His Son in full deity to this planet, He was good.
[time=2330] And that Son of His came and rescued us from our sins and gave us a chance.
[time=2336] And there was somebody in this building earlier today that went, "I didn't know that till now I remember that Easter Sunday, 1978, when I gave my life to Christ, and someone opened the Bible and said, "Here's how you can know you're going to go to heaven.
[time=2351] Have your sins forgiven all that?" And go, "Really?
[time=2354] I've been doing church my whole life.
[time=2357] I never heard this before.
[time=2360] Is it because it wasn't there or is it because I wouldn't hear?" On that day, God's Spirit met my soul and I believed.
[time=2371] And that was good.
[time=2374] Even while we're at sinners, Christ died.
[time=2376] He's not waiting for you.
[time=2378] I'll give you a piece of advice.
[time=2379] Don't try to become a good little church person so you'll be acceptable to Him.
[time=2383] There aren't any good church people.
[time=2387] We're pretending.
[time=2391] All us church people are pretending to be good.
[time=2393] We dress up.
[time=2394] We come on.
[time=2395] None of us are any good.
[time=2399] We're all just in the muck and the mire of this planet trying to figure it out
[time=2405] and along comes the good news that we can know salvation.
[time=2408] And we go, "Yes!" And we grab it.
[time=2413] And we're still lousy people.
[time=2415] That's what makes church so hard.
[time=2417] It's a gathering of a bunch of lousy people who are supposed to be good.
[time=2422] And then when one of them is not good, everybody goes, "They're not good."
[time=2428] A bunch of hypocrites.
[time=2435] So we sing.
[time=2436] We pray.
[time=2437] We live in Him.
[time=2439] We live through Him and we live for Him because our great God was also a very good God.
[time=2450] Now, let's talk about the problem.
[time=2455] Watch this.
[time=2456] This is an iPad.
[time=2458] And I'm an old guy.
[time=2462] And I know how to open it.
[time=2467] And it's asking me to hook onto its wireless.
[time=2470] And I don't want to.
[time=2472] This is a quote from a third century B.C.
[time=2476] from an atheistic philosopher called Epicurus.
[time=2479] And he gave a very interesting conundrum for followers of God.
[time=2484] Here's what he said, "Is God willing to prevent evil but not able?
[time=2488] Then He is not omnipotent.
[time=2490] Is He able but not willing?
[time=2493] Then He is malvalent.
[time=2495] Is He both able and willing?
[time=2497] Then once comes evil, is He neither able nor willing?
[time=2500] Then why do we call Him God?
[time=2505] Beloved, we deserve that question.
[time=2509] We deserve the question that says this.
[time=2512] If you're God so great and you're God so good, why did a guy paint his hair red and shoot people?
[time=2522] You sing about his eye being on the sparrow.
[time=2525] I don't think he's paying attention.
[time=2527] How dare you tell me you're God's great and good?
[time=2530] Look at all the junk around us.
[time=2533] If he's so great, why was there a tsunami in Japan?
[time=2540] Or India?
[time=2544] Why did 91 mile an hour winds knock trees over on people's houses?
[time=2553] By the way, I had a revelation yesterday.
[time=2555] I was blowing my driveway off.
[time=2557] And I want a blower that's got like 200 miles an hour worth of air.
[time=2561] You know what I'm talking about?
[time=2562] I'm thinking, why do I need that to blow grass off a driveway?
[time=2565] It took 91 miles an hour to knock an oak tree over.
[time=2567] It was just a thought that came to me while I was out there in the driveway.
[time=2572] Ponder that and the men will go, there's a blower with 200 miles an hour.
[time=2578] Where do I get that?
[time=2581] I could blow my neighbor's house.
[time=2583] No, I don't want to do it.
[time=2585] Epicurus puts it to us and basically saying this,
[time=2592] if you're God so great, then why doesn't he prevent evil?
[time=2597] Perhaps he is great, but he doesn't really care because if he really cared, evil wouldn't exist.
[time=2602] Therefore, since evil exists, we can assume that God is neither great nor good.
[time=2609] Why would we call him God?
[time=2615] I want to give you the answer in an Old Testament, a New Testament, a present-day anecdote, and then hopefully get the illustration in and I have five seconds to do it.
[time=2626] I've always wondered, I've always wondered what it was like, oh, I'm past, I'm already, I'm counting up.
[time=2632] This is a beautiful thing.
[time=2634] I've always wondered what it would be like to be here.
[time=2637] I've never spoken here on Sunday morning and have the clock counting me down.
[time=2641] I always wondered, what if God wanted to do something just past zero?
[time=2651] I apologize to all of you who have reservations at Cracker Barrel.
[time=2654] You will be late.
[time=2656] I really want to tell you this.
[time=2658] I hope you'll humor me and I apologize to the technical people that I'm messing with.
[time=2663] At Wall and they just take it for granted, that they're going to get messed up.
[time=2671] Let me recommend a book for you and then go into this issue.
[time=2674] The author is named Denise D'Souza, D-I-N-E-S-H-D,
[time=2680] apostrophe, S-O-U-Z-A.
[time=2682] The name of the book is God for sake and D'Souza is a leading Christian apologist, travels the world debating atheists on behalf of Christ.
[time=2691] His book is written from a philosophical and rational and scientific point of view to answer these questions.
[time=2697] Why are there earthquakes?
[time=2699] Why are earthquakes good?
[time=2701] D'Souza has a scientific reason about tectonic plates.
[time=2704] I'm able to make life happen that you can read about.
[time=2707] I'm not a scientist.
[time=2708] I don't know anything about that stuff.
[time=2710] But I recommend the book.
[time=2711] In that book, John Stott on page 54 said, "The greatest conundrum for Christianity is the presence of evil."
[time=2720] Here's your Old Testament answer.
[time=2721] The book of Job.
[time=2722] Will you go there with me, please?
[time=2724] It's right before Psalms.
[time=2726] If you're trying to find it, Psalms pretty big, easy one to find.
[time=2731] In this book, lots of bad stuff happens to a really good guy.
[time=2736] And I mean a really good guy.
[time=2738] According to God, there was no one like him on the entire face of the earth, blameless before God, and here's what happened to him.
[time=2746] He lost all of his business.
[time=2748] He lost all of his possessions.
[time=2750] They were destroyed stolen.
[time=2751] His children all died in a tornado hurricane, 91 mile an hour wind.
[time=2756] The only thing that was left was the one thing he probably wished wasn't left, and that was his wife.
[time=2766] No offense, dear.
[time=2769] And I say that because of the type of wife she was.
[time=2772] She was a miserable wife.
[time=2775] So all the good stuff's ripped off of his life.
[time=2778] And in chapter one, he responds in verse 20 of Job.
[time=2781] And Job arose.
[time=2782] He tore his robe.
[time=2783] He shaved his head.
[time=2784] He fell to the ground, and he worshiped.
[time=2787] Are you kidding me?
[time=2791] And he said, "Naked, I came from my mother's womb.
[time=2793] Naked I shall return.
[time=2794] The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away.
[time=2796] Blessed be the name of the Lord." Through all this Job did not sin, nor did he blame God.
[time=2801] What's really interesting in Job's theology?
[time=2804] God is the one who gives.
[time=2806] We all like that.
[time=2808] What else does God do?
[time=2811] It takes away.
[time=2813] That ain't right.
[time=2814] I didn't sign up for take away.
[time=2818] 1978, Easter Sunday, I'm doing the give part.
[time=2821] You know, it's like the husband and wife, for better and better.
[time=2826] For richer and more richer.
[time=2829] In health and in greater health.
[time=2832] That's not what we say when we promise our undying love, is it?
[time=2836] But when it comes to God, man will rise up and say, you're a lousy God.
[time=2843] My life stinks, and you had the power to make it unstinky.
[time=2849] You had the knowledge to keep this from happening, and you let it happen, and it's your fault, right?
[time=2856] That's not what Job did.
[time=2858] Job said, it was good, and now it's bad, and God's still great.
[time=2865] Chapter 2, the attack comes on his own person.
[time=2870] He now has to go to the hospital.
[time=2872] He's sick.
[time=2873] The hospital is an ash heap outside of town.
[time=2875] They weren't real sophisticated in their medical procedures, and those days he's out there scraping stuff with rocks.
[time=2881] His wonderful wife, who's left behind, rises up in verse 9 and says, Do you still hold fast to your integrity?
[time=2889] Curse God and die.
[time=2891] Thank you, sweetie.
[time=2894] Appreciate the love and the compassion.
[time=2901] He said to her, you vile woman.
[time=2905] No, he didn't.
[time=2906] He said, you speak as one of the foolish women speaks.
[time=2909] Shall we accept the good from God and not accept adversity?
[time=2914] And all this Job did not sin with his lips.
[time=2920] The Old Testament answer is this, God gives you good and God gives you bad.
[time=2924] The New Testament answer is from the book of James that says something like this, kind of all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, because those trials have a perfecting work in your life, and if you will stand strong in the midst of that trial, you will become complete in your faith.
[time=2946] But, do you know what happened to Job?
[time=2954] He got whiny in chapter 31 verse 35.
[time=2959] He finally rose up and says, I deserve a hearing before God.
[time=2963] He has treated me unjustly, and I want to talk to him about how I've been treated.
[time=2968] I followed him, I did everything he's supposed to do, and look what I got for my effort.
[time=2973] One cranky wife, that's it.
[time=2980] We don't have time to go into it, but chapters 38 to 41, God shows up and he plays a game with Job.
[time=2988] Are you smarter than the Creator?
[time=2993] And he begins to question Job, where were you when I made the earth?
[time=2997] You'd been here to counsel me, you're so smart.
[time=3000] God used a little sarcasm.
[time=3002] God comes up to a little trash talking.
[time=3006] Job, why weren't you there when I laid the foundations of the earth?
[time=3011] You could have told me where the oceans would have stopped.
[time=3013] If you would have been there, you could have counseled me, you're so smart.
[time=3017] You get what God's doing?
[time=3021] He looks at Job, and he takes him through a litany, and Job at the end goes, "I don't want to talk to you anymore." And literally throws his hand over his mouth, "I don't want to talk to you anymore.
[time=3035] Leave me alone!" And Job falls to his ground and he repents.
[time=3039] If Job had followed the advice of his three friends, he would have had this perspective on God.
[time=3044] You serve God as long as it prospers you.
[time=3049] And when it stops prospering you, you question his validity and his reality.
[time=3057] He's not great, and he's not good if your life isn't making you happy.
[time=3064] Oh, that hurts.
[time=3069] Job rose above his friends.
[time=3082] This is so important for you because I know, I know friends, you're going to face trials of incredible pain,
[time=3092] incredible difficulty in your life, and one of the first things you might be tempted to do is go,
[time=3098] "Where is the guy watching the sparrows?"
[time=3105] Psalm 119, 67, "Before I was afflicted, I went astray.
[time=3109] But now I keep your word.
[time=3113] You are good, and you do good.
[time=3116] Teach me your statutes. What is he saying?" God has allowed perhaps even caused affliction, and the psalmist says that was a good thing.
[time=3129] Verse 71, "It was good for me that I was afflicted, that I may learn your statutes.
[time=3135] The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces.
[time=3139] There is nothing more important to me than knowing you.
[time=3143] And if it means I have to go through pain, then so be it."
[time=3149] Perhaps the reality of pain is not so much a testimony of the inadequacy of God but the stubbornness of man.
[time=3157] What else will teach us? How else do we learn?
[time=3161] How else do we gather information about him other than to go through trial?
[time=3171] Here's the anecdote. Thursday, I was at Riley Hospital.
[time=3174] A little guy from our church is having surgery.
[time=3177] If you've never been to Riley, it's an amazing place.
[time=3180] I thank God. Every time I'm there, I'm just amazed at Riley Hospital and what they do.
[time=3185] This little guy was born in Spina Bifida, and he's five years old.
[time=3188] He's had over 20 surgeries in his life already, and he was facing a 10-hour surgery
[time=3194] where they literally rerouted his entire digestive tract.
[time=3197] I told you they used his appendix to now drain.
[time=3200] Amazing. I'm sitting there with his parents, and I'm thinking about this message a lot.
[time=3206] And so I thought, "I'll take a shot." I said, "Do you guys ever ask why me? Why me? Why's my kid have to go through this?"
[time=3218] And the wife looked at me and said, "It never occurred to us to ask that." And then they said, "No, we asked why?" And then they told the name of another family in our church.
[time=3228] Let me tell you their story. About two months ago, I was at a funeral for a baby.
[time=3233] A baby in our church died, and one of our pastors on our staff was doing the funeral.
[time=3238] And I was just standing there. Amy and I were there, and we were being supportive, cheering on, praying for the guy, hoping the family's okay because these trials can derail your faith.
[time=3247] And I'm kind of looking down, you know, at a funeral like that, scruffing around with my feet. I'm not really paying attention.
[time=3253] And all of a sudden I look down and there's a tombstone right in front of me.
[time=3256] It says, "Noah Scott Conning." Next to it was another one, and it said, "Johanna Claire Conning."
[time=3265] A little ways over. There was the third one, and it said, "Emily Elise Conning."
[time=3273] I'd been there for all three of those funerals.
[time=3276] The Conning's attend our church. Three babies died. Three.
[time=3283] So the couple whose son's in attend our surgery says, "We don't ask why us, but we do ask why for the Conings." I ask why, too.
[time=3293] I do. And you know what the answer is?
[time=3299] Where were you when I made the earth? And will you believe me for your pain on this planet?
[time=3307] If I'm smart enough to do all of this, if my greatness is constantly on display, and I show you my goodness over and over, and I deem it necessary for you to go through this pain
[time=3318] and this trial at this time, I'm still great and I'm still good, and it's okay.
[time=3324] Now that's not an answer, though. I didn't solve anything.
[time=3330] People still paint their hair red and go into movie theaters and shoot people.
[time=3335] I can't tell you why other than men are inherently evil, and they will do evil things.
[time=3344] And God has allowed that evil to exist within the framework of His greatness and goodness
[time=3351] so that He can rescue some people who are covered in evil and make them good.
[time=3357] I'm sure glad He did that in 1978 for me.
[time=3366] Yesterday was yard day at my house. I already had my blower out, right?
[time=3369] There are four tools that takes to do a yard in suburbia. You need a lawn mower.
[time=3374] You need a lawn a weed eater. You need an edger, and you need a blower.
[time=3380] Give me those four things I can make your yard look less brown. That's all I can do.
[time=3388] I'm edging my lawn and I thought about the Lord. I know it's weird. This is what preachers do.
[time=3394] I apologize. We're just strange dudes.
[time=3397] And I'm thinking, this is a perfect illustration of what I'm preaching about tomorrow.
[time=3402] We love life to be straight and clean.
[time=3407] We cannot deal with randomness.
[time=3410] When God grows grass, what does it look like?
[time=3415] He goes every which way.
[time=3417] When I grow grass, I want to cut smooth this way. I want to edge this way.
[time=3422] And I think my life ought to be like a gusta-national.
[time=3428] It ought to be perfect.
[time=3430] And if there's a leaf that drops into my life, there ought to be some guy with a stick or a hose to knock that leaf off the fairway.
[time=3439] That's not how it is though, is it beloved? Jim Pearson got cancer.
[time=3446] Do you think he loved God less than me? No way.
[time=3452] Do you think his faith was smaller than Kelly's? No way.
[time=3459] The fact of the matter is, God rises up and has the audacity to say,
[time=3466] "I am great, and I am good, and sometimes you're going to have unexplainable pain.
[time=3474] Trust me. Trust me."
[time=3480] Here's what I know about my God. I am a sheep to be slaughtered.
[time=3486] And if it brings glory to his name, to slaughter, so be it.
