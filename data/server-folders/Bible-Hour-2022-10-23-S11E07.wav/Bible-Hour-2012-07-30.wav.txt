[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Well hello again everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=35] It's great as always to be with you.
[time=36] I've got two things.
[time=38] We'll keep it real simple today.
[time=40] Two things I wanna make sure you hear me say, I look forward to these moments where I get to share what's on my heart with those of you in the broadcast audience and I wanna make sure today that you hear me talk about two things.
[time=53] Number one, this series that we're in right now, I haven't even taught yet.
[time=58] So far it's been Steve Webster.
[time=60] It's been Pastor John Sootch from Wallen.
[time=63] Today you're gonna hear from Josh Rang, one of our teaching pastors here at Blackhawk.
[time=69] You're gonna hear from Jesse Hannah next week.
[time=71] And then I get to close us out on August 12th.
[time=74] I'm so looking forward to it.
[time=76] This series is called Core.
[time=78] And Core is about core beliefs.
[time=81] We've been doing our very best to bring you week after week doctrines from the Word of God.
[time=88] Doctrine's from the Christian faith that we believe are absolutely essential, essential to what you ask, essential to your everyday life.
[time=100] That's right.
[time=101] I want you to understand that doctrine, theology, that the deep truths of the scriptures, the person of God, the issue of sin, the person in work of Jesus Christ, the church, these are things that you have to understand and having everyday opportunity for you to live out these truths, to understand these truths, to communicate these truths.
[time=127] This is stuff that's absolutely vitally important that you understand and know and are able to practice.
[time=134] You see, they are core truths and at the core of who you are, when you understand these things, they affect the way you live, they affect the way you choose, they affect the way you think.
[time=145] So please watch, please go back and look at them.
[time=148] Please go back and look at the digging deeper material for each and every message.
[time=154] Use the digging deeper material to help you and your small group or you and your own personal study.
[time=160] It's been a tremendous series and I hope you'll take advantage of the great opportunity it represents for you to grow and deepen your own faith.
[time=169] Okay, second thing is this.
[time=171] I'm gonna have the guys put on the screen my Twitter address or my Twitter account.
[time=177] I don't even know how to say it.
[time=178] I'm on Twitter.
[time=180] I've got my Instagram account up there for you.
[time=184] I've got my email address up there for you.
[time=187] This is me saying to you all, I truly want to stay connected with you.
[time=192] I want you to know what's going on, not only in our church, but in my own life and ministry.
[time=197] The media, the opportunity through social media to communicate things that are really important, to communicate things that God's doing in my own life and heart.
[time=206] I want you to be a part of that.
[time=207] So follow me and communicate with me through these avenues and I can't wait to see our relationship grow and I can't wait to share with you the things that God is doing in my life and in our ministry.
[time=220] All right, there you have it.
[time=221] Two things, thanks for tuning in and thanks for letting me share what was on my heart.
[time=225] God bless you and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=229] - Well, good morning.
[time=230] Yeah, I was telling the first service that I've been here for about 39 years.
[time=237] It'll soon be 40 as I turn 40 soon.
[time=240] But yeah, I was here from the very beginning and again, anytime we get an opportunity to be up here, I also want to say thank you to this place for all the influence and all that this place has done to shape me and mold me and I'm just very grateful.
[time=258] So, and also grateful for the opportunity to be up here.
[time=261] As Kelly talked to me about preaching, this was several months ago and when he said the doctrine of sin, I thought, well, my first thought was, okay, that sounds pretty easy because I'm an expert at sinning.
[time=277] But then my second thought was, oh no, it's probably gonna be really challenging because not only am I an expert at sinning, you are an expert at sinning as well.
[time=288] So I thought you probably know just as much about it as I do.
[time=291] But as I was reflecting on it, I just kept coming back to this one main thought, trying to understand how all of this comes together.
[time=302] You know, Steve Webster said it about the Bible.
[time=306] John Such said it about God.
[time=308] How do you talk about one of these topics in 40 minutes?
[time=310] It's rather challenging.
[time=312] But as I thought about it and reflected upon it and God's spirit helped me think through that, I kept coming back to this one main idea.
[time=319] It's this.
[time=321] My mind kept coming back to the fact that the topic of sin, doctrine of sin, cannot really be treated outside of the context of the hope we have in the plan of God to redeem us through the work of his son by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=342] In other words, sin and Christ's work on earth are inseparably linked.
[time=349] Let me define my terms real quick.
[time=353] Sin, as we talk about the doctrine of sin, many different words throughout the Old Testament and New Testament to define what sin is.
[time=361] But some of those words come back to the idea of air.
[time=364] They come back to missing the mark, come back to lawlessness.
[time=370] But I think at the heart of it is really just this idea of rebellion.
[time=374] This idea that there is a creator God who has told us how we are to live.
[time=382] And yet you and I every day want to go our own way and do our own thing.
[time=388] And in essence, we are rebelling against our creator.
[time=392] And so sin certainly is an air and missing the mark and lawlessness and ignorance at times, but comes down to what I believe is just rebellion against our creator.
[time=402] Christ's work on earth, I would say, in defining that really quickly is basically again, what Paul said to the church at Corinth, chapter 15, he said, "I delivered to you that which was a first importance "that Christ died for our sins." It's right there on your hand, it's an easy way to remember it, but that is the essence of the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ.
[time=424] It points to again just his perfect life that he lived on this earth without air, without missing the mark, without lawlessness, without rebellion against his father.
[time=436] And also then his substitutionary atonement
[time=442] through his death at Calvary and his resurrection three days later to signify him conquering death and sin and that we get to participate in that because of what he has done.
[time=456] And so again, I believe the scriptures are clear that sin and Christ's work on earth are inseparably linked because on the heels of any conversation about sin is the hope of redemption in Christ.
[time=469] All throughout scripture, it's that way.
[time=471] Any discussion of sin cannot travel far from the foot of Calvary.
[time=476] I believe it must be centered on Calvary.
[time=479] Give you a few examples all the way back to the very beginning.
[time=481] In Genesis chapter three, we understand that Adam and Eve chose to disobey God that Eve took the apple and ate of it.
[time=490] And after that in Genesis three was God's pronouncements of judgment upon the serpent, upon Adam, upon Eve, upon all of creation.
[time=500] But understand that even in the midst of that initial judgment, there was hope.
[time=507] There was a glimmer of hope as God said in Genesis 3.14, he said to the serpent, because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all the beasts of the field, on your belly you shall go and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
[time=521] I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring.
[time=526] He shall bruise your head, the offspring, the coming one, the Messiah would bruise or crush the head of Satan.
[time=539] And he would bruise Christ's heel.
[time=544] So on the heels of that judgment comes the hope of Calvary, the hope of the anointed Messiah.
[time=553] Something that might be a little bit more familiar to you in Romans 6, 23.
[time=556] Again, they're not far linked, but Romans 6, 23 says, "The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." You see, there's judgment and then there's hope to quickly follow.
[time=570] So in the time we have together this morning, my goal is to show you how sin and Christ's work on earth are inseparably linked as we explore the doctrine of sin.
[time=581] And we're gonna look at this link in three different ways.
[time=585] Before we get into that, would you pray with me?
[time=588] Father, we gather together and again just want to confess.
[time=596] We want to admit that we desperately need you.
[time=600] We need to hear from you.
[time=601] We need your spirit to open our eyes.
[time=605] Lord, you have said that you are the bread of life
[time=611] that has come down from heaven.
[time=613] Would you this morning through your word, through the power of your spirit, would you feed us?
[time=617] And again, every time I step before a crowd
[time=623] to preach your word, I'm reminded of my great need.
[time=628] And I just ask that these words would be your words and that you would give me wisdom and that you'd give me clarity of thought and that you would feed me as well 'cause I need to hear from you this morning.
[time=642] Lord, help us to again see wonderful things from your truth this morning.
[time=648] In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[time=652] Well, sin and Christ work on earth are inseparably linked in three ways.
[time=658] And we're gonna look at those three ways this morning.
[time=660] First of all, they're inseparably linked because we are sinners.
[time=666] They are inseparably linked because God has to judge sin and they are inseparably linked because Christ is the only remedy for sin.
[time=679] So let's look at the first one together.
[time=680] Sin and Christ work on earth are inseparably linked because we are sinners.
[time=685] In other words, if sin had not entered the world, there'd be no need for redemption.
[time=691] There would have been no curse.
[time=697] But it did because of the sin.
[time=702] And as we talk about this, it speaks to the doctrine of what's called total depravity.
[time=708] That may be a term that you're familiar with.
[time=713] But what that speaks to is the condition of who we are as humans.
[time=718] And total depravity does not mean that we are as bad as we can possibly be, but it does mean that you and I apart from Christ have no good in us.
[time=731] We have no capacity to do good.
[time=736] We are totally depraved.
[time=738] Romans 3, 10 says it with this way.
[time=742] There is none righteous, no not one.
[time=747] There's not one of us on our own, apart from Christ that can say we're good.
[time=753] That's just not a reality for the human race because we are sinners.
[time=758] And we're sinners, first of all, by nature.
[time=761] And then secondly, we're sinners by choice.
[time=763] Let's look at the first part.
[time=764] We're sinners by nature.
[time=765] It's a part of our human makeup.
[time=767] It's who we are.
[time=769] Ephesians 2, verses one through three, says this.
[time=772] Says in you were dead and trespasses and sins in which you once walked.
[time=776] Following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the heir, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience, among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and mind.
[time=790] And we were by nature children of wrath, just like the rest of mankind.
[time=797] See, Ephesians 2 is talking about what we were apart from Christ, but as it talks about that, it describes the fact that we were by nature, our very makeup, we were children of wrath, even as the rest.
[time=814] It says, Romans 5, Paul says it this way, verse 12, therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, talking about Adam, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sin.
[time=830] In verse 18, he completes the thought.
[time=832] He says, therefore, as one trespass, what happened in the Garden of Eden, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.
[time=846] Notice there again, you've got judgment followed by hope, right?
[time=849] And then he says this, "For as by the one man's disobedience, "the many were made sinners." So first and foremost, this idea that we are sinners by our nature.
[time=866] It's who we are.
[time=868] But not only that, we are sinners by choice.
[time=873] The humility it takes to receive and obey the commands of God alludes me every day.
[time=879] I'm a proud person.
[time=882] I think we're all proud.
[time=884] But what happens is this, I do not want an authority figure in my life telling me what to do, and when I should do it, it started back in the day with my parents.
[time=896] I wanted to do my own thing.
[time=900] I didn't want to submit to their authority in every way.
[time=903] It moved from my parents then to teachers and coaches, continues with the government and the laws that they have.
[time=913] Even though I know they're supposed to be there for my good, I still don't want anybody telling me what to do.
[time=920] Can you relate to that?
[time=924] Shows up in my workplace.
[time=926] I don't want to submit to the authority of those that have been placed over me.
[time=932] And I would think that you're no different because we all, when given a choice, we want to think that we know what's best.
[time=942] Reminds me of what it says in Psalm two.
[time=946] Listen to the words of verses one through three.
[time=950] It says this, "Why do the nations rage "and the peoples plot in vain?
[time=956] "The kings of the earth set themselves "and the rulers take counsel together "against the Lord and his anointed.
[time=965] "You're a part of the kings of the earth.
[time=968] "You're a part of the rulers that take counsel "against the Lord and his anointed.
[time=972] "And here's what they say, and here's what you say, "and what I say, let us burst their bonds apart "and cast away their cords from us." In other words, I don't want to have God as an authority in my life.
[time=986] I want to cast away any kind of cords that he would have on me.
[time=990] That's what Psalm two says.
[time=993] I think that describes me pretty well.
[time=999] Isaiah 53 says it this way.
[time=1001] All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned everyone to his own way.
[time=1008] Listen to the lyrics from one of our nation's icons
[time=1016] back in the day, you may be able to finish some of these lyrics for me.
[time=1020] But here's what it says in this song, and now the end is here.
[time=1025] And so I face the final curtain.
[time=1027] My friend, I'll say it clear.
[time=1028] I'll state my case of which I'm certain.
[time=1031] I've lived a life that's full.
[time=1032] I've traveled each and every highway, and more, much more than this, I did it my way.
[time=1039] Regrets, I've had a few, but then again, too few to mention.
[time=1044] I did what I had to do and saw it through without exception.
[time=1047] I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway, and more, much more than this, I did it my way.
[time=1055] Yes, there were times I'm sure you knew when I bit off more than I could chew, but through it all, when there was doubt, I ate it up and spit it out.
[time=1066] I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way.
[time=1071] Could be said that that would be the American theme, right?
[time=1078] But that's you, and that's me, and that is the whole human race apart from Christ.
[time=1086] See, we're sinners.
[time=1091] We're sinners by nature.
[time=1093] We're also sinners by choice.
[time=1096] Sin and Christ work on earth are inseparably linked because we are sinners.
[time=1101] Secondly, sin and Christ work on earth are inseparably linked because God has to judge sin.
[time=1108] Sin did enter the world, and God's disposition towards sin is clearly seen throughout Scripture.
[time=1117] It speaks to the doctrine of God's attitude towards sin.
[time=1120] First, we look at different scriptures that God hates sin.
[time=1126] This is what he's like.
[time=1129] Go back to Psalm two.
[time=1131] We saw in verses one through three, the kings of the earth and the rulers take their stand against the Lord and his anointed, and they say, "I don't want you to be my authority figure." Here's his response in verses four and five.
[time=1143] He who sits in the heavens laughs.
[time=1146] The Lord looks, the Lord looks them in derision, holds them in derision.
[time=1152] Then he will speak to them in his wrath and terrify them in his fury.
[time=1157] God doesn't take kindly to those who want to rebel against him.
[time=1166] He hates sin, he hates rebellion.
[time=1168] Psalm five says it this way.
[time=1170] Verse four and five, "For you are not a God "who delights in wickedness, evil may not dwell with you.
[time=1175] "The boastful shall not stand before your eyes.
[time=1178] "You hate all evil doers." Psalm seven says it this way.
[time=1184] God is a righteous judge and a God who feels indignation every day, indignation, just a big word for anger.
[time=1193] Put it this way, God is a righteous judge and a God who feels anger every day.
[time=1200] This is who he is.
[time=1205] This is his disposition towards sin
[time=1212] to say that he doesn't like it is a vast understatement.
[time=1215] He hates it.
[time=1217] Exodus 20 and understanding the severity of sin
[time=1223] in the midst of the context of the 10 commandments.
[time=1226] He says to his people, "You shall not bow down to them "to other gods or serve them for I, the Lord your God, "imme jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers "on the children to the third and fourth generation "of those who hate me." He looks at sin with great severity.
[time=1244] Go to the New Testament in Romans one.
[time=1249] For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.
[time=1262] Have you ever seen anyone full of wrath before?
[time=1268] Pails in comparison to the wrath of God.
[time=1279] Against sin.
[time=1280] So apart from Christ this morning, the wrath of God abides on you.
[time=1290] The hatred towards sin and the hatred toward the rebellion against the Creator.
[time=1296] We all have rebelled.
[time=1298] We're all sinners by nature and by choice.
[time=1301] And yet if you have not bowed the knee to Jesus, that wrath of God, his disposition towards your rebellion and your lawlessness puts you at enmity with God because he hates sin.
[time=1315] Not only does he hate sin, but he has to judge sin.
[time=1320] It's a part of his nature.
[time=1322] He's holy.
[time=1324] He has to do what he said he would do back in Genesis three.
[time=1329] When he said, you shall not eat of the tree.
[time=1333] For if you do eat of it, you shall surely die.
[time=1336] There was pain and punishment and judgment that would come from that original disobedience.
[time=1342] He's promised to judge sin.
[time=1349] He has to judge sin.
[time=1352] You know, as I think about that, I think about my relationship with my daughters and I think about there are times and they happen too often.
[time=1364] But when we talk about discipline and the reality is, in my mind, I just am too tired to deal with it.
[time=1372] And so you know what?
[time=1373] I say, we'll deal with that later.
[time=1375] But the reality is that later never comes usually.
[time=1382] And so I'm sure whenever my kids hear that from me, we'll deal with that later.
[time=1386] They probably, you know, breathe a sigh of relief because they know, okay, that means that's not gonna happen, which is not good for them.
[time=1393] But the reality is that that's a reality.
[time=1396] And as I was thinking about this, it started to help me think how they might be thinking of me in that situation and how that would cause them to feel a greater freedom to disobey me at times.
[time=1419] And I thought about the fact that when I fail to discipline them, it comes back on me to say that I'm really not a man of my word and that they can just get away with things sometimes.
[time=1434] And yet as I go back to God and him being my heavenly father,
[time=1440] he is perfect in that.
[time=1444] Every sin will be judged.
[time=1448] There's no circumstance or situation where he's gonna say, you know what, I'm just tired.
[time=1453] We'll deal with that later.
[time=1455] Now maybe in his mercy, there might be times
[time=1461] when he deals with that later.
[time=1462] But he is going to judge sin.
[time=1468] Every sin will be judged.
[time=1473] God's hatred towards sin will end in his wrath being delivered.
[time=1479] Job 34 says this, therefore hear me, you men of understanding, far be it from God that he should do wickedness and from the almighty that he should do wrong, for according to the work of a man, he will repay him.
[time=1491] And according to his ways, he will make it befall him.
[time=1495] John 3 36 says this, it's a part of this judgment, whoever does not obey the sun shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.
[time=1506] First Peter 1, 17, and if you call on him as father, who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time on earth.
[time=1517] So God hates sin, and also he will judge sin.
[time=1525] Every single sin will be judged.
[time=1533] Then it's just a question of, are you going to take that judgment?
[time=1537] Are you going to take that wrath from God?
[time=1541] Or are you going to allow Jesus to take that wrath for you?
[time=1546] But every sin, every sin will be judged.
[time=1551] It's a part of his character.
[time=1553] He must judge sin.
[time=1555] So sin and Christ work on earth are inseparably linked because first of all, we're sinners.
[time=1562] But secondly, sin and Christ work on earth are inseparably linked because God has to judge sin.
[time=1568] And the third sin and Christ work on earth are inseparably linked because Christ is the only remedy for sin.
[time=1578] This speaks to the doctrine of Christ's work against sin.
[time=1588] And as I think about the Gospels, and I think about the Gospel of John specifically, one of the main reasons Jesus came was to conquer sin.
[time=1597] And so as we move through the book of John, I want to notice, and I want to take examples from Christ's commitment to go to Calvary to conquer sin.
[time=1610] It started in the Gospels in the very beginning when Angel Gabriel came to Joseph and Mary and said, "You shall name him Jesus, or you shall call him Jesus, "for he will save his people from their sins." Before he was even born as a human, there was a mission that he was on to save his people from their sins.
[time=1633] And then in John chapter one, verse 29, as John the Baptist was out in the Jordan River and baptizing those, and out in the distance, he sees Jesus coming as he's beginning his earthly ministry and he says, "Behold, or look, the Lamb of God "who takes away the sin of the world." He was on a mission, dedicated, committed to move to Calvary.
[time=1659] John three, he says this in a conversation with Nicodemus,
[time=1665] and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, he's talking about an Old Testament scenario where the people of Israel were wandering in the desert.
[time=1674] And at this certain time, they were whining and complaining and wishing that they could go back to Egypt and as a result of their disobedience, God causes a judgment to come on them that serpents would come and bite them and kill them.
[time=1686] And yet in the midst of that judgment, there was still hope because God called Moses to lift up a serpent's staff.
[time=1694] And if the people of Israel would look to that serpent, they would be saved and they wouldn't perish.
[time=1699] And so now Jesus takes that Old Testament context, which Nicodemus would know very well, and he brings it forward to his own life.
[time=1707] And he says this, just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.
[time=1718] From his beginning of his ministry, he was on a course to Calvary.
[time=1723] John eight, few chapters later, he said this, "When you have lifted up the son of man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own authority, but speak just as the Father taught me.
[time=1738] He who sent me is with me.
[time=1739] He has not left me alone for I always do the things that are pleasing to him." You see, Christ wasn't down here just living for himself.
[time=1748] He was on a mission to please the Father, to do the will of the Father, to go to Calvary to cover sin.
[time=1756] John 12, 27 to 33.
[time=1762] Listen to the humanity of Jesus.
[time=1767] He says this, "Now is my soul troubled.
[time=1770] And what shall I say?
[time=1774] Father, save me from this hour, but for this purpose I have come to this hour." See what he's saying?
[time=1784] He's dialoguing and he's saying, "What can I say?
[time=1788] Would save me from this in his humanity and understand the emotion of all that he was headed to, the very wrath of God being poured out upon him at Calvary, being lifted up on a cross." And he's there and he says, "Could you save me from this?
[time=1803] And yet this is exactly why I've come.
[time=1807] This is my purpose.
[time=1809] This is what I'm committed to.
[time=1813] And a voice came from heaven, says I have glorified your name and I will glorify it again.
[time=1818] And the crowd stood there and heard it and said it had thundered.
[time=1822] But others said an angel spoken to him.
[time=1824] And Jesus answered, "This voice has come for your sake, not mine.
[time=1828] Now is the judgment of this world.
[time=1830] Now will the ruler of this world be cast out.
[time=1832] And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself." He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die.
[time=1843] And then just the night before, John chapter 18 in the Garden of Gethsemane as he's sweating drops of blood and thinking about all that he was going to experience the next day, the separation from his father, the wrath of God, the judgment that I deserved and that you deserved.
[time=1870] He says this in John chapter 18, when he sees Judas coming in verse three.
[time=1876] Judas having procured a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests went there with lanterns and torches and weapons.
[time=1884] Then Jesus knowing all that would happen to him came forward, said to them, "Whom do you seek?" They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth." And Jesus said to them, "I am he."
[time=1901] They drew back.
[time=1903] Or when Jesus said to them, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground.
[time=1908] Notice the picture here?
[time=1911] We get to see a little bit of the sovereign power of Jesus.
[time=1917] It just took him audibly speaking.
[time=1922] I am he and those who had come to get him could not help but step back and fall to the ground.
[time=1931] This was the very sovereign power of the universe.
[time=1935] Stepping forward to experience all that God had for him
[time=1941] to accomplish my redemption and yours.
[time=1944] He goes on to say this, "Peter pulls out the sword."
[time=1950] Verse 10, "Having a sword, he drew it "and struck the high priest servant's ear "and cut off his right ear." So Jesus said to Peter, "You're to put your sword "into its sheath, shall I not drink the cup "that the Father has given me?" The cup, referring to the crucifixion.
[time=1973] That cup is the cup of God's wrath.
[time=1979] All of God's anger and hatred towards sin.
[time=1983] All of God's judgment on sin.
[time=1987] That you and I deserve.
[time=1991] That cup was deep, that cup was full, that cup was strong, that cup was intense.
[time=2000] And yet he says, "The night before, "shall I not drink the cup that the Father has for me?"
[time=2012] A commitment, a dedication, a ongoing movement toward Calvary.
[time=2017] So that he could be the Lamb of God to take away my sin.
[time=2025] That's why he came.
[time=2030] Not only was it the main reason that Christ came, but also understand this.
[time=2038] No one else can pay for my sin.
[time=2043] There's no other plan.
[time=2049] First Timothy two says this, "For there is one God and there is one mediator "between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, "who gave himself as a ransom for all, "which is the testimony given at the proper time.
[time=2067] "He's the only one that has lived a perfect life.
[time=2071] "He is the only one that could be a substitute for me.
[time=2075] "He's the only one that can pay for my sin, "because he is the only one who is the perfect "spotless Lamb of God." First Peter three says this, "For Christ also suffered once for sins, "the righteous for the unrighteous." We could say the just for the unjust, the one who never sinned to those who are sinners.
[time=2099] And he did that, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit.
[time=2109] No one else can pay for my sin.
[time=2114] There's no other way to deal with sin.
[time=2119] And yet we are people who simply want to manage our sin,
[time=2125] don't we?
[time=2126] Somehow lessen its impact through being better or through self leadership or through psychology, but this is not why Jesus died.
[time=2137] Jesus did not die so that we could simply manage our sin.
[time=2142] Jesus died to eradicate our sin and to conquer our sin
[time=2148] and to mortify our sin.
[time=2154] He's the only answer.
[time=2156] There's no other place to go.
[time=2159] There's no other route.
[time=2161] Not only was it the main reason that Christ came, not only is it that no one else could pay for my sin, but lastly, no one else could accomplish all that he accomplished by dying.
[time=2172] There's no one else.
[time=2177] No one else could take my place.
[time=2182] No one else could be the substitute.
[time=2184] He accomplished the defeat of sin.
[time=2188] My debt has been paid.
[time=2191] Every one of my sins past, present and future has been judged and is over and done.
[time=2200] Romans eight one tells me, therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[time=2208] It's finished.
[time=2210] Every one of my sins has been judged because God is just and yet it didn't fall on me.
[time=2218] I didn't have to drink the cup.
[time=2225] It fell on him.
[time=2230] He drank it all.
[time=2233] He took it all.
[time=2234] He's the only one that could.
[time=2239] He did that for me.
[time=2242] The debt has been paid.
[time=2244] Every one of my sins has been judged.
[time=2249] So he accomplished the defeat of sin, but not just for me, the defeat of sin for eternity.
[time=2256] We don't have time to look there, but in Revelation 20, it tells us that Satan, that death, all of that will be thrown into the lake of fire forever and ever.
[time=2269] The promise of Genesis three made good into all eternity.
[time=2274] God will finally, completely deal with sin forever.
[time=2280] And if you're not found in Christ, if you're not willing for him to be your substitute and you'll be a part of that 'cause no one else can pay for your sin, but him.
[time=2299] He also accomplished through his death the hope of a redeemed world.
[time=2307] You know, in Romans eight, it says this.
[time=2308] He says, "For I consider the sufferings "of this present time are not worth comparing "with a glory that is to be revealed to us.
[time=2314] "For the creation waits with eager longing "for the revealing of the Son of God, "for the creation was subjected to futility, "not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, "in hope that the creation itself "will be set free from its bondage to corruption "and obtain the freedom of the glory "of the children of God." You see, even our world is groaning.
[time=2340] It was not meant to be the way it is.
[time=2343] The death of loved ones, sickness, despair, all of that was not what God intended, intended from the beginning.
[time=2351] And yet even through what Christ has accomplished, that will be made new one day.
[time=2358] So he accomplished the death of sin for me and forever.
[time=2365] He accomplished the hope of a redeemed world and he accomplished that the rendering of sin powerless.
[time=2372] Do you realize that if you are in Christ, you don't have to sin.
[time=2379] You're no longer enslaved to sin.
[time=2381] Romans six says this, "For if we have been united with him in a death like his, "we shall certainly be united with him "in a resurrection like his.
[time=2389] "We know that our old self, "talking about our sinful nature, "our old self was crucified with him "in order that the body of sin, my flesh, "might be brought to nothing.
[time=2402] "That word brought to nothing means rendered powerless.
[time=2406] "My old flesh through the work of Christ "has been rendered powerless "so that I don't have to obey its lusts "and desires anymore.
[time=2415] "But now I can obey the one who has died for me." No one could accomplish all that Christ accomplished
[time=2426] through his death and his resurrection.
[time=2429] So sin and Christ's work on earth are inseparably linked
[time=2435] because first and foremost we're sinners.
[time=2437] We're sinners by nature and sinners by choice.
[time=2439] They're linked inseparably because God has to judge sin.
[time=2443] He hates it and he will judge every single sin.
[time=2447] And thirdly, sin and Christ's work on earth are inseparably linked because Christ is the only remedy for sin.
[time=2454] So in conclusion, knowing that sin and the work of Christ
[time=2460] are inseparably linked, I believe we can conclude that one of the best ways to battle sin on a daily basis is with the gospel.
[time=2470] This is how God deals with it, how he did deal with it.
[time=2477] So why don't we deal with it that way?
[time=2480] Tim Keller has said this.
[time=2484] He says the Bible's purpose is not so much to show you how to live a good life.
[time=2491] The Bible's purpose is to show you how God's grace breaks into your life against your will and saves you from sin and brokenness, otherwise you would never be able to overcome.
[time=2505] Religion, he says, is this, if you obey, then you'll be accepted.
[time=2510] But the gospel is if you are absolutely accepted and sure you're accepted, only then will you ever begin to obey.
[time=2520] That's good, that's the power of the gospel in our lives.
[time=2525] So while we are experts at sin, I am you are.
[time=2534] I must argue this morning that we need to become experts in the work of Christ, because I believe when you're an expert in the work of Christ, that when you sin and you will, probably right after church, that your mind will not be occupied with guilt and condemnation that Satan tries to bring, but your mind will be occupied with the hope and promise of Christ and his work at Calvary.
[time=2560] I believe when you're an expert in the work of Christ, you will remain on the gospel road.
[time=2565] You won't try to just over-perform and be better and you won't go to the other side and just despair and give up.
[time=2571] Your mind will be set on the hope, knowing that your sins have been paid for.
[time=2577] The judgment deserved has been poured out on Jesus.
[time=2581] And while your sin saddens God, it does not change your position before God as a justified sinner.
[time=2589] I believe that when you're an expert in the work of Christ, you will sin less because the gospel reminds you how awful sin is because its true cost was the destruction of Jesus at Calvary.
[time=2603] It does not lessen the severity of sin.
[time=2606] On the contrary, I believe it heightens the severity of sin.
[time=2610] When you believe, I believe when you're an expert in the work of Christ, your life will be more and more about him rather than about you.
[time=2619] And like John the Baptist, you'll say, "He must increase and I must decrease." When you become an expert in the work of Christ, you'll spend more time rejoicing in your forgiveness than wallowing in your guilt.
[time=2635] You need to become experts in the work of Christ because when you sin, Satan is there to bring condemnation and guilt, but also understand that when you sin and what God has shown throughout the Bible is that any judgment on the heels of any judgment is the hope of Calvary.
[time=2656] The hope that he's covered that sin and it's paid for and done and there is no condemnation.
[time=2666] So how do you become an expert in the work of Christ?
[time=2672] We have no problems becoming an expert at sinning, right?
[time=2676] And it's easy for us to do and Satan loves to help out with that.
[time=2681] How do you become an expert?
[time=2684] Couple ideas for you.
[time=2687] As you read the scripture, as you open up your Bible, learn to pay attention to the declaratives of scripture that are in there.
[time=2696] Declaratives are just a grammatical term that means statements of fact.
[time=2701] Those things that are true about God and what he has done.
[time=2706] Imperatives are commands.
[time=2708] Those things that God has prescribed for us.
[time=2709] And while those are important, it's the declaratives that are the foundation of our faith and it's the declaratives that fuel our obedience to the commands of scripture.
[time=2719] Become someone who understands the declaratives of scripture.
[time=2726] Focus on those truths about who God is.
[time=2730] Memorizes verses like Romans eight one.
[time=2734] There's therefore no condemnation for me because I'm in Christ Jesus.
[time=2738] There's a little book out there that I would wish everyone would have the gospel primer by Milton Vincent.
[time=2744] It will thrust you into the depths of Calvary like never before.
[time=2749] Read other books about Christ.
[time=2753] Whatever it may be.
[time=2756] But we need to become an expert in the work of Christ
[time=2763] as we understand the doctrine of sin.
[time=2766] It leads us, propels us, thrusts us into the work of Christ at Calvary.
[time=2774] Just a few minutes we're gonna take communion.
[time=2783] And as we take communion this morning, certainly communion is a time to examine yourself as the scriptures would say.
[time=2794] To make sure that there isn't any unconfessed sin or to make sure that you're not holding on to something that you would be an idol in your life.
[time=2806] And I certainly would encourage you to do that.
[time=2809] And at the same time this morning, would you spend more time in communion thinking about what Christ has accomplished for you
[time=2825] than the guilt of your sin?
[time=2826] Would you take the time to reflect upon
[time=2832] all that Christ has done for you?
[time=2835] When he said in talking about communion that this do in remembrance of me, it's talking about all that he is and all that he's accomplished.
[time=2851] And so would you allow our time together this morning to be a time where yes, you acknowledge your sinfulness, that you are a sinner by nature and by choice, it's very true, but would you let that propel yourself into the glories of Calvary?
[time=2867] Into the wonder and amazement of the fact that there is this creator God who would send his son to live a perfect life, to be a substitution for me, that he would take the wrath that I deserve so that I could be justified and declared righteous before God.

[time=3426] Amen, amen, you may be seated.
[time=3430] John chapter six, Jesus speaking to the crowd,
[time=3439] he says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, "as not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, "but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
[time=3447] "For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven "and gives life to the world." Crowd responded, "Sir, give us this bread always." Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life.
[time=3463] "Whoever comes to me shall not hunger, "and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.
[time=3469] "I am the bread of life.
[time=3470] "Your Father's ate the man in the wilderness, "and they died.
[time=3473] "This is the bread that comes down from heaven "so that one may eat of it and not die.
[time=3478] "I am the living bread that came down from heaven.
[time=3481] "If anyone eats of this bread, "he will live forever, "and the bread that I will give for the life of the world "is my flesh." (upbeat music)
