[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] [MUSIC - 22 seconds]
[time=60] (audience applauding) - Amen.
[time=64] We wanna take some time now to pray,
[time=75] to thank God for what he's doing in your life.
[time=79] He's an amazing, omniscient, powerful God who's at work in each of us doing something good.
[time=86] And so we wanna take some time now over the next few songs to pray and give thanks to him for everything that he's doing.
[time=92] Ask the Spirit of God to bring to mind different parts of your life that you can thank him for.
[time=99] And don't shy away from the parts that seem muddy and dirty and confusing and hard.
[time=104] Thank him for those too, because Paul says that we're to be thankful for everything.
[time=110] The good stuff and the bad stuff and anything in between.
[time=113] We're gonna sing a few more songs and I wanna invite you to take a posture of prayer and just thank God this morning.
[time=147] [MUSIC - 184 seconds]
[time=334] deliver our comfort, our joy throughout the ages. You've been our shelter, our peace in the midst of the storm.
[time=352] We will remember, we will remember, we will remember the works of your hands.
[time=364] And we will stop and give you praise, for praise is that faithfulness.
[time=376] When we walk through life's darkest valleys, we will look back at all you have done.
[time=388] And we will shout our God is good and He is the faithful one.
[time=400] Hallelujah, hallelujah to the one from whom all blessings fall.
[time=411] Hallelujah, hallelujah to the one whose glory has been shown.
[time=423] We will remember, we will remember, we will remember the works of your hands.
[time=435] And we will stop and give you praise, for praise is that faithfulness.
[time=451] Amen, He's worthy to be praised.
[time=463] He's worthy to be thanked for everything that He gives and everything that He allows to take place in our lives.
[time=472] Another way to remain in Christ is to come together in gatherings like this and to sing His praises.
[time=478] When we sing with each other, it inspires us to give Him praise and to worship Him and to remain close to Him as we journey through this life.
[time=487] So I want to invite you to stand with us now and we're going to sing a few more songs together in hopes that help us abide in Christ our Savior.
[time=508] [MUSIC]
[time=520] Lord, I come, I confess, I'll bring you, I find my best, but without you, I fall upon you, the one that guides me.
[time=546] Lord, I need you, oh, I need you.
[time=553] Every hour I need you, my one defense, my righteousness, oh God, how I need you.
[time=573] Your sin runs deep, your grace is more, and grace is found, is where you are, and where you are.
[time=587] Lord, I am free, holiness is Christ in me.
[time=596] Can swear you are, Lord, I am free, holiness is Christ in me.
[time=611] Lord, I need you, oh, I need you.
[time=618] Every hour I need you, my one defense, my righteousness, oh God, how I need you.
[time=638] Lord, I need you, oh, I need you.
[time=645] Every hour I need you, my one defense, my righteousness, oh God, how I need you.
[time=663] My one defense, my righteousness, oh God, how I need you.
[time=679] Christ, oh, cornerstone, we made strong in the Savior's love through the storm.
[time=695] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[time=709] Let's sing that chorus one more time, Christ alone.
[time=717] Christ alone, cornerstone, we made strong in the Savior's love through the storm.
[time=732] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[time=740] Christ alone, cornerstone, we made strong in the Savior's love through the storm.
[time=756] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[time=774] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the earth hear his voice.
[time=784] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the people rejoice.
[time=793] O come to the Father through Jesus the Son, and give him the glory, great things he has done.
[time=804] O God, be the glory, great things he has done, so loved the world that he gave us his Son.
[time=813] He yielded his life and the torment for sin, and opened our life gates that all make go in.
[time=824] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the earth hear his voice.
[time=832] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the people rejoice.
[time=841] O come to the Father through Jesus the Son, and give him the glory, great things he has done.
[time=852] Glory, glory, glory, glory, give him glory, great things he has done.
[time=887] O praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the earth hear his voice.
[time=897] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the people rejoice.
[time=906] O come to the Father through Jesus the Son, and give him the glory, great things he has done.
[time=924] Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour, it's great to be with you, my name is Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege, and it is that, an absolute privilege to serve on this team here at Blackhawk
[time=935] as we do our very best with God's help to bring the life-changing, eternity-altering truth of his word to you each and every week.
[time=945] And as we do that, we're so encouraged.
[time=947] As we see so many of you in our broadcast audience, you begin to over time show up, we get to meet you face to face, you walk through these doors, and Blackhawk and this family becomes a home, a family.
[time=960] And I know in a sense we're family because you watch every week and you feel like you're apart, but I want to just encourage you again, if you've been watching, come and meet these people, and be in this room with us and experience what it's like to worship God, and be in the Word of God together, live and in person, it's really, really something special.
[time=981] Hey, I want to tell you about two things. I hope you'll just mark these down on your calendar.
[time=985] I hope you'll enter them into your iPhone or however you keep track of things.
[time=990] On August 26th, Sunday evening, we're going to have an amazing night.
[time=995] Two things, the night of worship we call it, now night, coupled with a baptism down at Blackhawk Pool.
[time=1001] We're going to do our baptisms outdoor at the local pool down at the Blackhawk Pool.
[time=1006] We're going to walk down there as a family following a night of worship.
[time=1010] So, an hour or so of singing and praising and worshiping our God together, and then those who can, we're going to just march on down to the pool and have a tremendous baptism service down there at the pool, and I hope you'll come and be a part of that night with us.
[time=1024] You can learn more about it on our website at blackhawkministries.org, and it's something I think that will really encourage you.
[time=1032] And then I want to tell you, Sundays, the 19th and 26th of August, the last two Sundays in August, Sunday mornings, the teaching, those two Sundays, is going to be all about where Blackhawk Ministries is headed in the days to come.
[time=1047] It's going to be two Sundays that really will capture our vision and our mission, a vision and a mission, I think, that is so absolutely compelling.
[time=1056] I don't want to be a part of it without you.
[time=1059] And so I want you to come and hear about it as we begin to retool and think about a new ministry season with September just around the corner.
[time=1066] We are really, really excited about the things that God has put on our hearts.
[time=1070] So come and be with us, the 19th and 26th.
[time=1073] Can't wait to see you. Thank you so much for being a part of this family.
[time=1077] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=1081] Have you ever had a week when you just don't click?
[time=1084] You just feel off.
[time=1086] One of the reasons is my oldest just today turned 11.
[time=1091] She's up there.
[time=1094] And I love her.
[time=1096] And I'm proud of your dad.
[time=1099] She's great.
[time=1102] I'm thankful for the 11 years we've had to be with her.
[time=1105] And I love her. Happy work day.
[time=1114] Didn't see that coming.
[time=1116] Geez, every time I come here, I cry or something.
[time=1118] Anyway, we'll get through it.
[time=1120] Anyway, I've just been off.
[time=1122] That was one reason because I'm like, no, my baby girl is getting older.
[time=1125] And the other reason was I just got back from a trip with 24 people.
[time=1129] Most of them students and most of them female.
[time=1133] Okay?
[time=1135] There's two of them right there.
[time=1137] Shout out, shout out.
[time=1139] Okay? And I took them to the Smokies on a backpacking expedition.
[time=1145] And I don't know why I did this.
[time=1150] I don't know where the idea came from.
[time=1154] What evil book I read it out of.
[time=1157] Most of these students had never done anything like this.
[time=1162] For some reason I said, let's go to the Smokies and give it a try.
[time=1167] And we get off the bus and I'm checking packs and they got these backpacks on and they're too heavy.
[time=1174] They're too loaded down with stuff they don't need.
[time=1177] And some of the backpacks aren't the right kind of backpacks.
[time=1180] And some didn't have the right shoes on.
[time=1183] But they get off the bus and they're all excited.
[time=1185] They're just happy and they're talking and laughing.
[time=1187] And then a few hours in it's kind of like, you know, it's still a little chipper but not as much.
[time=1192] And then halfway through it's just like, we hate you.
[time=1196] You know, they're just yelling at me.
[time=1198] And they did completely awesome.
[time=1203] The first day was six hours straight up.
[time=1208] And it was a grueling, grueling hike.
[time=1212] And I was so proud of them.
[time=1215] The girls, I didn't hear much complaining.
[time=1218] I didn't hear any, you know, I didn't hear too much of that.
[time=1221] I was in the back but I didn't hear too much of that.
[time=1225] And I was super proud.
[time=1227] And the whole time we just kept yelling, nobody quits.
[time=1231] Nobody quits.
[time=1233] And that was kind of our theme.
[time=1235] That life, sometimes like the trail is going to get rough.
[time=1238] It's going to get hard.
[time=1240] Things are going to happen.
[time=1241] You're going to step in a puddle and your shoes are going to get wet.
[time=1244] You're going to have to, you'll break a water filter.
[time=1247] So you got to use a couple less than you thought you had.
[time=1249] You got to filter water.
[time=1250] They realized the value of water and how pressure.
[time=1253] They made it was like liquid gold to us.
[time=1256] It was wonderful.
[time=1257] I had a great trip and I'm so thankful for the students who went on it.
[time=1260] And it was really good.
[time=1261] So anyway, I'm off because I'm kind of transitioning from that.
[time=1265] And I just feel off.
[time=1266] I just can't quite get going again.
[time=1269] And so I tried to take some time off this week to be with my beautiful family.
[time=1274] But at the same time, I had to get ready for this morning as I was kind of trying to balance.
[time=1279] And I don't know if I did a good job with it.
[time=1281] But here we are today and I'm glad to be here with you.
[time=1286] Although I'd much rather be at the lake on the pontoon.
[time=1290] Just being honest.
[time=1294] Authenticness is good.
[time=1297] And for those of you who are at the lake on the pontoon, I am not very happy.
[time=1301] Okay.
[time=1302] That's right.
[time=1303] KB mentioned we are, oh, I didn't say anything about my new role.
[time=1308] Because to be honest, I'm not sure what to say.
[time=1311] It's kind of like, that's another reason I'm off.
[time=1313] Because for 15 years, all I've done is just due to ministries.
[time=1317] That was me and that was Amy and I.
[time=1319] And that's where we were headed.
[time=1320] And that's where we linked arms and we're doing that.
[time=1323] And two years ago, God just started working on my heart.
[time=1327] Just kind of saying, hey, that corner is coming to turn that corner.
[time=1332] And I can't explain it other than there's just something in every youth guy.
[time=1336] You know, you're always the interim youth pastor.
[time=1339] You know, age or something is going to catch you.
[time=1342] And so I don't know what exactly it was.
[time=1344] And so now I find myself in a place where I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do when I grow up.
[time=1351] And so we'll just have to see what happens over this year and all that kind of stuff.
[time=1356] So anyways, I'm excited to help with this connecting effort.
[time=1362] Because this morning's message is barely going to scratch the amount of content that we need
[time=1373] to do to give it justice.
[time=1376] And what's cool about this place, Eric Hall mentioned to me this week when we were at a meeting, that this is not the destination, the gathering where we come.
[time=1386] What we do here on Sunday morning is not it.
[time=1390] We cannot do what we need to do in a 30, 40 minute message.
[time=1396] But we can start the conversation here.
[time=1401] And we can take it to those smaller connecting communities, those small groups, those women Bible studies, those men's groups, whatever my ABF's, grow groups.
[time=1410] Or we can get face to face with each other.
[time=1412] We can ask hard questions and we can dig into the scriptures together.
[time=1416] That's what needs to happen.
[time=1419] We're just an hour Christian.
[time=1421] If we just come on Sunday morning for an hour, our faith will be about an hour deep.
[time=1428] We have to, we must, as a body, come together in smaller settings.
[time=1432] Because I believe in the SOTAs KB and SOTAs KB, that's where transformation happens.
[time=1437] So that's what I'm going to be trying to give a lot of effort to.
[time=1441] And I'm now KB's boss and I'm going to try to keep him in line as well.
[time=1446] So awesome, we'll keep going.
[time=1448] That's not true.
[time=1449] Okay.
[time=1450] Kinda.
[time=1451] No, not even kinda.
[time=1453] Alright, so this morning, core understanding.
[time=1455] This is what we're here to do today.
[time=1457] We've been in this series for the last few weeks.
[time=1460] And we have discussed word.
[time=1462] We've discussed God.
[time=1464] We've discussed sin.
[time=1465] And this morning we're going to be looking at Christ.
[time=1468] And the next week, KB's going to come.
[time=1470] And he's, he's pretty stoked about church.
[time=1472] That's what he's going to talk about.
[time=1474] These core understanding, these core theologies.
[time=1477] Okay.
[time=1478] This is kind of what we're talking about.
[time=1479] Theology is important because correct understanding.
[time=1483] Being able to handle the scriptures.
[time=1487] Believing what is in line with scripture is essential.
[time=1490] And it's essential because it's so interconnected to how we are in relationship with God.
[time=1497] See, if we don't understand God rightly, we can't be in relationship with God rightly.
[time=1502] How we think about God is important.
[time=1504] How we think about sin and Christ and the church.
[time=1508] And the other many beliefs that are found in the Christian worldview.
[time=1511] They matter to all of life.
[time=1514] If I were to take a painting, the Mona Lisa, you know, the real, the legit one.
[time=1520] The authentic one.
[time=1521] And put it up here.
[time=1522] Many of us would be like, "Oh, that's pretty cool.
[time=1525] Look at that." We would maybe buy insurance if that was our painting.
[time=1529] We'd want to ensure it, put it in a glass case and protect it.
[time=1532] Put little ropes around it so nobody could touch it.
[time=1535] Now, I put that same painting on this side.
[time=1537] I put some crayons up here and I brought some kids up.
[time=1540] They would say, "All right." And just draw on it because it looks like a great canvas.
[time=1544] She needs a beard.
[time=1546] Right?
[time=1547] Perspective.
[time=1548] How we think about something truly matters to how we will act.
[time=1553] We all have, this is cool.
[time=1554] We all have a core understanding.
[time=1556] Every hall, every one of us in here has a theology.
[time=1560] All of us.
[time=1561] It's either a good one or it's a bad one.
[time=1566] If it strays from the scriptures, then it's a substitute theology, but still a theology.
[time=1572] Atheism is the theology that there is no God.
[time=1575] It's the faith statement that there is no God.
[time=1577] Still, it's a theology.
[time=1580] Not a very good one, in my opinion, but it's a theology.
[time=1583] And side note, I said this in the first hour.
[time=1586] Many times with theology.
[time=1588] When we talk theology, there's theology, right?
[time=1591] We choose sides or we get into camps.
[time=1595] And we choose maybe the Calvinistic stance or the Armenian stance, right?
[time=1601] And now we kind of take, we take this grid and we lay it over scripture.
[time=1605] And that's kind of how we look through that lens.
[time=1608] Now, that's not wrong, right?
[time=1610] But we have to have this thing called, I like to call, balance.
[time=1615] We can never come to the point where we think we have it all, especially this figured out,
[time=1622] locked in, systematized, ordered, alphabetized, boom, boom, boom.
[time=1626] I know exactly what this is saying.
[time=1629] For me, seminary was not so much when I come out.
[time=1632] I know everything about the Bible.
[time=1633] I knew so much less because I knew how much there was now.
[time=1637] It's about the right questions.
[time=1640] And so sometimes our theology can turn into this brick and it's rigid and it's solid.
[time=1646] And when we talk with people, it hurts.
[time=1649] I like to kind of consider it as this big water filled balloon.
[time=1654] It's got some restrictions to it, but it moves with how God is growing and changing me.
[time=1662] That doesn't mean anything goes, but it definitely means it's not a brick.
[time=1666] It doesn't come off as arrogant or rigid or I've got it all figured out because let's face it,
[time=1674] we don't.
[time=1675] We really don't.
[time=1677] We are a people of faith seeking understanding.
[time=1682] That's what we're doing.
[time=1684] And so today we're going to talk about, we're going to seek, we're going to try to understand Christ, week four, Christ.
[time=1693] And the centrality of Christ to the entire created order is a matter of faith expressed in our worship as a church.
[time=1700] John's gospel, the gospel according to John, proclaims it through him all things were made.
[time=1706] Paul writes in Colossians, "By him all things were created, things in heaven and things on earth visible and invisible.
[time=1712] All things were created by him and for him." Paul goes on to claim that all things hold together and through him there will be this reconciliation, Christ is the central figure to our faith and our life and our future.
[time=1727] But what makes Jesus so special?
[time=1730] What is it about Jesus?
[time=1732] No man has had more impact on a world than Jesus Christ.
[time=1736] There is little in our world that has not in some way been influenced, impacted or altered by his words, his actions and his claims.
[time=1745] Jesus is known throughout the world.
[time=1748] Many people who would not claim to be a Christian agree that Jesus was a real person.
[time=1752] Most people would tell you that Jesus was born and what we celebrate is Christmas and his birth divides our calendar.
[time=1758] Many would claim that he was a wise man, a teacher or a philosopher who was one of the most influential figures in history.
[time=1766] Finding a person who believes that he was a real person isn't too challenging, isn't that difficult.
[time=1770] All the major religions hold that Jesus was a real person, a great teacher or a prophet.
[time=1775] On my campus at Ball State every year, at least when I was there, was this campus group.
[time=1782] They would hold this forum, this debate, this discussion in the lobbies of our dorms and
[time=1788] leading up to the day that that was going to happen.
[time=1792] They would plaster the campus and especially the dorm with flyers and posters and these big banners.
[time=1799] This is what it would say.
[time=1800] They would write big letters.
[time=1801] Who is Jesus Christ?
[time=1802] That's what they would put in.
[time=1808] It was designed to stir a motion to get people to come out and talk about who Jesus is.
[time=1814] I don't know how effective it was.
[time=1815] People would usually end up just arguing, but the poster was there and that's kind of the question we're answering to, at least in part, like I said earlier, this only scratches the surface, but our core understanding, the thing we're going to look at today is that Jesus is fully man and fully God.
[time=1836] Now there are so many other aspects of Christ and what was going on with that whole story of Christ, but this one is the one God put on my heart to share with you this morning.
[time=1845] I don't know if it's going to be new.
[time=1847] I don't know if it's you've never heard this before, if you've heard it a thousand times, but that's what church is about, it's about proclaiming Jesus Christ, that he was fully God and fully man.
[time=1857] See, most will admit that Jesus was real and did some amazing acts, but finding people believe that he was really God is very difficult.
[time=1865] That seems to be where the line gets drawn.
[time=1868] So here's how I would state it, our core understanding, a theology of Jesus, at least a piece of Jesus, and the person of Jesus, God physically entered into our world and
[time=1879] infinite God came to live in a finite world.
[time=1882] If God and man became one person, a person unlike anyone in the world has ever seen or will ever see.
[time=1888] Jesus Christ was and forever will be fully God, fully man, and one person.
[time=1894] So our claim today, Jesus Christ was fully God and fully man.
[time=1897] And we begin with, as many of us began, a birth.
[time=1900] So we're going to look at some evidences that kind of point to that kind of highlight that would seem plausible that Jesus was actually human, that Jesus was actually a man.
[time=1910] It says this, I'm in Matthew 1, 24 to 25, if you want to turn there, you can.
[time=1916] It says this, "Now the birth of Jesus took place in this way.
[time=1919] When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph before they came together, she found to be with child from the Holy Spirit.
[time=1927] And her husband Joseph being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolve to divorce her quietly." Now there's something going on there, two things, one, when I first read this as a beginning believer, I still had, I call it street smarts, right?
[time=1942] I still thought Christians were kind of crazy, and church was really weird, and they sing these, it was still kind of odd, right?
[time=1949] And when I read this, I'm like, how did, how did Jesus get in there?
[time=1953] That was my question, I asked my friends mom, how did, how did that happen?
[time=1958] Because it says right here that they, you know, they didn't know.
[time=1961] So you might explain that, as it did, the Holy Spirit's wave of magic wand, pixie dust,
[time=1967] how did that go on?
[time=1968] She explained to me, through the Holy Spirit, this immaculate thing, this miracle thing, I'm like, okay, cool.
[time=1973] And the other thing that's going on here is that Joseph decides to, he was going to just kind of get out of it quietly, because in that day, unfaithfulness, which was it seems like, because Mary's pregnant, that she should be stoned, she should be stoned.
[time=1988] And so he loved her, he liked her, he didn't want her to die, so that's kind of two dynamics going on there.
[time=1993] So, we continue a little later in the verse, she will bear a son, and she called his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins, all this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophets, behold the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,
[time=2008] and they should call his name Immanuel, which means God with us.
[time=2012] When Joseph woke from sleep, he did, as the angel of the Lord commanded him, he took his wife, but he knew her not until she had given birth to a son, and he called his name Jesus.
[time=2022] This is how God chose to come into the world.
[time=2031] This is God coming back to the planet, in the form of a man, a normal way, semi, well
[time=2041] that's unique, but it's still kind of how we were through a birth.
[time=2046] Now it's different, there's a little bit difference between our birth and their birth.
[time=2049] The first thing, the difference, one of the things we can say about this birth is that
[time=2055] why this is important is that salvation, this is key, salvation is only from God.
[time=2063] This shows that ultimately salvation must come from the Lord.
[time=2067] The virgin birth is an unmistakable reminder that salvation can never come through human effort, but must be the work of God himself.
[time=2075] Our salvation only comes about through the supernatural work of God, and that was evident at the beginning of Jesus' life.
[time=2082] This is God doing something here.
[time=2084] Man, Mary has a piece of it, she's mere vessel, but God is orchestrating, God's power, God's
[time=2091] Holy Spirit, God is doing this, and it shows that only salvation comes from God.
[time=2096] The second thing, the virgin made possible that uniting the full deity and the full humanity, right?
[time=2102] That Jesus is fully man, this birth kind of makes that possible to unite full deity and full humanity in one person.
[time=2110] This is how God, in His sovereignty, chose to bring and save the world into the world.
[time=2115] It is possible, now we can think, okay, couldn't God have done it a different way?
[time=2120] Yeah, yeah, we could think about it.
[time=2122] He could have maybe simply created Jesus as a complete human, right?
[time=2128] And brought him on earth and on a cloud, or he could have brought him down a beanstalk, I mean, he could have done a lot of things.
[time=2136] But then it would have been very difficult for us to see how Jesus could be fully human as we are.
[time=2141] See, it's really important that we hold that Jesus was fully man and kind of came in a
[time=2147] birth the way we did, right?
[time=2150] That's a big part.
[time=2151] God could have also had Jesus come of the world through two parents, right?
[time=2155] He could have just married Joseph, married, boom, just kind of waited a little bit, did the whole thing.
[time=2161] Jesus comes of the world.
[time=2162] He could have done that and united the divine nature miraculously in this human nature.
[time=2168] But it would have been very hard to understand for us how Jesus was fully God, because His birth was just like ours, almost identical to ours.
[time=2178] See, the birth, uniqueness of His birth helps us see that, yes, He is human, but also, yes,
[time=2184] He is God.
[time=2187] There are other possibilities, but we're just going to move on.
[time=2190] Well, let me say this.
[time=2191] The virgin birth also makes possible Jesus' humanity without inherited sin.
[time=2197] Now this one, if there was a mountain to die on, I'm not sure about this explanation.
[time=2204] Let me say it and I'll say two things.
[time=2206] The virgin birth makes it possible to true humanity without inherited sin.
[time=2209] See, last week, Rang talked about sin that we all have it, right?
[time=2213] It all came with us, right?
[time=2215] Battery's not included, but sin was, okay?
[time=2219] But Jesus was not, Jesus did not have sin.
[time=2222] Now traditional doctrine, some teach that because Jesus had no father, the line from
[time=2228] Adam was broken and therefore sin did not transfer to Jesus.
[time=2233] See that's the mountain, okay, I'm just going to hold it there.
[time=2236] It's in my balloon, but okay, I hear that.
[time=2239] But then someone would say, "Well, what about Mary?" So Mary was sinful, Mary had sin, right?
[time=2245] Some religions say that she wasn't.
[time=2247] We, I think Protestants would say, "Yes, she was human, she was normal." She had sin.
[time=2254] The answer to this, they would say, "Well, the Holy Spirit came upon her and prevented
[time=2260] the sin of Mary to be transferred to Jesus," okay?
[time=2265] So there's that going on that this kind of helps the understanding that Jesus was sinless.
[time=2270] The other thing I would like to say about Jesus and his sinlessness is that Jesus has always been, in other words, there's never been a point in time when Jesus was not.
[time=2280] The preexistence of Christ means he always has been, right?
[time=2286] Now God is using Mary for him to come into the world.
[time=2290] In other words, he's, he's already there.
[time=2294] So that could also possibly explain why there is no sin in Jesus, because he has already been.
[time=2299] He's not existent.
[time=2300] He's co-eternal with the Father.
[time=2303] So his birth definitely shows the uniqueness of his birth, how it happened definitely shows
[time=2309] that he is human.
[time=2311] There's a second way.
[time=2314] There's three things under this.
[time=2315] One, he had a human, there's three things, three categories, trying to, KB wanted me to categorize these a little better, okay?
[time=2321] First thing is he had a human body, as we just said.
[time=2324] He grew just like us.
[time=2327] I remember my kids, they've been growing forever, right?
[time=2331] And I remember the stages of diapers, right?
[time=2334] It's like, get the little, eat witty, bitty ones, you know, you care, we get them on there.
[time=2340] And then they got the pull-ups, right?
[time=2341] Jesus eventually made it to pull-ups, right?
[time=2344] He grew just like us.
[time=2346] We ate food, and he grew just like we did, kind of points to his humanity.
[time=2349] He became tired and weary.
[time=2353] He was thirsty.
[time=2354] Jesus got thirsty.
[time=2355] Again, these are all things pointing to his humanity.
[time=2358] He got angry.
[time=2359] There's not one of his in here that's never been angry or thirsty.
[time=2364] Remember, in the temple, when he walked in the temple, he just threw all the tables all over because they had turned his father's house into a den of robbers, and he just flipped all the tables up.
[time=2373] I love that story, it's such a good story.
[time=2375] He became hungry, he bled, and eventually he died.
[time=2379] That's the second category.
[time=2380] He had a human mind, just like us.
[time=2384] He increased in wisdom.
[time=2387] If you want to turn in Luke chapter 24, you know how I'm just going to reference it briefly.
[time=2391] This is a cool story.
[time=2393] It's one of Scott's favorites, it's become one of my favorites, but this is after the
[time=2400] resurrection on the road to mass, when Jesus, he's back, and he's walking with these two guys, but they don't recognize him, they don't know who he is.
[time=2410] They're talking about Jesus to him being Jesus, and they're like, "Where have you been?
[time=2415] How'd you miss all this stuff about Jesus?" Jesus is kind of dialogued with talk with him about some stuff, and then they kind of come to the village where they're headed, and this is what the text says.
[time=2426] It says, "Jesus acted as if he was going farther." I love that.
[time=2432] It's kind of like when there's one cookie left, and there's a couple of people around, everybody's kind of acting like they don't want it.
[time=2440] All right?
[time=2443] You got to take it.
[time=2444] All right?
[time=2445] Jesus.
[time=2446] He's walking with these guys, and they're talking.
[time=2447] It's obvious he wants to keep going with them.
[time=2450] Right?
[time=2451] That's kind of what he wanted to do.
[time=2452] But he's just kind of, "All right, see you guys." Right?
[time=2455] He's acted if he was going to keep going, and really, he was just going to go with them.
[time=2459] That to me, just there's humanity all over that with the cookie, and we get that.
[time=2463] We see that.
[time=2464] I love that story.
[time=2465] The third area is he had human emotions.
[time=2470] We are emotional people, and Jesus being fully man was also emotional.
[time=2476] His soul was troubled.
[time=2479] My soul was sorrowful even to death.
[time=2482] He marveled at the faith of the centurion.
[time=2484] He marveled.
[time=2487] He wept at the death of Lazarus.
[time=2492] He prayed with loud cries and tears.
[time=2495] Tempted in every way, yet he was without sin.
[time=2499] In other words, he understands the power and the anguish of temptation, just like we have.
[time=2508] We have a Savior who is fully man and understands all that stuff, and that's pretty cool.
[time=2516] So the question, why is full humanness?
[time=2518] Why is him being fully man so necessary?
[time=2520] The first one is he represents our obedience.
[time=2525] He where Adam failed Christ found victory.
[time=2528] When Adam fell, Jesus stood strong.
[time=2531] This is why Paul calls Christ the last Adam, 1 Corinthians 15, and can call Adam the first
[time=2537] man in Christ the second man.
[time=2539] See, if we look at, I like to draw circles, and in one circle I put in Adam, and in the
[time=2545] other I put in Christ, if we talk about theological categories.
[time=2549] And in Adam we have sin, and we have death, and we have disobedience.
[time=2555] But in Christ we have life, we have righteousness, and we have obedience.
[time=2562] See these two things, that's why he represents our obedience, because he lived sinless life
[time=2569] and he took on the cross.
[time=2571] The second thing is because of that obedience, he is our substitute sacrifice.
[time=2577] As Josh Rang talked a little bit about last week, see Jesus being coming fully man means that he can literally take our place, that we deserve because of sin on the cross.
[time=2588] Jesus can be our substitute for the propitiation of sin, an acceptable substitute for us.
[time=2597] Fully man on the cross, dying for us, that's huge.
[time=2602] If Christ was not fully human, fully man, he could not have died to pay the penalty for man's sins.
[time=2610] Like I said earlier, we're scratching the surface of this doctrine.
[time=2616] This sets up, this holds all the Bible together, right?
[time=2622] The story typically goes, for God so loved the world that he gave his only son.
[time=2628] But then sin happened, right?
[time=2630] But we missed the fact that God so loved the world.
[time=2633] He created all this stuff, he created man, he created woman, and then sin happened.
[time=2638] Now it's all messed up.
[time=2640] Then we just fast forward to Jesus.
[time=2642] Time out.
[time=2643] God was on the planet.
[time=2645] Now he's back on the planet, coming down to take care of what he loves, to restore what
[time=2653] he originally had started.
[time=2656] I mean that's the story, right?
[time=2659] We can't miss that.
[time=2661] So let's continue Jesus' claim, where we claim in our core understanding that Jesus Christ was fully God and fully man.
[time=2668] Let's look at this, fully God.
[time=2671] Fully man and fully God.
[time=2672] So we're going to keep going.
[time=2674] We're going to look at a few scriptures, but let me explain one word to you.
[time=2679] I think it will help as we look at these words for you.
[time=2681] The word is disequilibrium.
[time=2685] In education circles, at least what I've been reading, is that this idea of disequilibrium
[time=2693] is it's caused when new knowledge or new experience or new questions or new problems
[time=2699] come, and there's nowhere to put that information.
[time=2703] There's no category, there's no box, there's no hook to hang it on, and it causes us to
[time=2709] kind of wrestle with that, and that's how we learn sometimes, typically that's how we learn.
[time=2714] And so the thing, Jesus' whole life is disequilibrium, right?
[time=2720] When the people of that time kept bumping into Jesus, time after time, the things he was saying and the things he was doing, they didn't have anywhere to put that stuff.
[time=2731] They had no idea how to handle this Jesus, right?
[time=2736] Because God had never come to the planet before, and so they were blind to it, and they had no idea how to see that, how to understand that, how to handle that.
[time=2745] And so they just, they just said, "Well, we'll just kill him." This is easy, we'll kill that guy, we don't understand what he was doing, we're just killing, right?
[time=2753] So, my favorite one, John 8, if you want to turn there you can, John 858, I'm not going to read the whole thing, but this is where Jesus is kind of talking to these guys again, Pharisees, he's saying he'll teach you the law, those kind of guys, right?
[time=2768] And they're talking about Abraham a little bit.
[time=2772] And Jesus says, "Your father," he's talking to these days, "your father, Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day.
[time=2779] He saw it and was glad." So the Jews said to him, "You're not yet 50 years old and have seen Abraham, how have you seen Abraham?
[time=2788] You're not that old, Abraham has been gone forever, right?
[time=2793] Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was, I am."
[time=2800] And we're looking at claims of Jesus claiming to be God, claiming deity.
[time=2808] Before Abraham was, I am.
[time=2811] Now a little more to the story, in Exodus chapter 3, Moses was going to go talk to some dudes and God's like, "Well, who should I say sent me?" Moses says, "Who should I say sent me?" And God says, "Well, tell him I am sent you." So now Jesus, knowing that, he knows that, put it together and says, "I am."
[time=2831] He basically takes the name of God that God had given to Moses way back.
[time=2837] And these Jewish guys, he's talking to, they're like, "Whoa, wait a minute."
[time=2843] Again, this district of religion is just hitting them right in the face.
[time=2847] You're like, "He just said, 'I am.'" He just claimed to be God.
[time=2850] We don't know what to do with that, so this is what to do.
[time=2852] They picked up stones to throw at him.
[time=2855] That's just what they do.
[time=2857] So if this isn't a claim of deity, this isn't a claim of something huge, right, then why
[time=2863] did they throw stones?
[time=2866] Jesus said something, they ticked them off, they didn't like it.
[time=2872] "I am." That's like another one.
[time=2875] John 10, and John 10, 30, he says, "I and the Father are one.
[time=2880] I and the Father are one." Again, this just equilibrium has happened and in their brains, they just can't quite figure out how do we, what do we do with that?
[time=2891] There was nowhere to go with that knowledge, there was nowhere to go with Jesus' claim.
[time=2896] Again, they picked up stones and said, "Well, it's stone him." Something was radically causing them to bump into the claim that Jesus was making.
[time=2909] And at the end, they said, "We're stoning because you being a man make yourself God."
[time=2915] That's huge, this is huge.
[time=2921] In Mark 2, when these guys, they have a, the paralytic buddy, he's paralyzed and they can't
[time=2929] get in through the door so they go through the roof and they kind of lure him down.
[time=2935] And the first thing Jesus does is he, he says, "Your sins are forgiven." It's like, "Wait, what?" He just came to get healed, but Jesus forgives his sin.
[time=2944] And these scribes are sitting there, these religious holders of the law, these professional law guys, and Jesus kind of sensed they're like, "What's he doing?
[time=2952] Only God can forgive sins.
[time=2955] What is he doing?" And to kind of show him one more, right?
[time=2961] He heals the guy because take your man and get out of here, right?
[time=2966] So not only does he forgive sins, but then he heals the guy right in front of them.
[time=2970] They're like, "We don't know what to do with this." Jesus is God.
[time=2976] Yeah.
[time=2982] There are four options for us.
[time=2987] There might be more, but these four, I think, are good of what we need to do with Jesus.
[time=2993] When we say the claim, "Jesus is fully God and fully man," right?
[time=2997] And we look to some of the evidence of his humanity and some of the evidence of his deity.
[time=3000] Again, we only scratch the surface.
[time=3002] I know this.
[time=3003] I hope you will take it home and look at some of the verses.
[time=3007] I'll put all the Bible references on my blog and you can check it out, okay?
[time=3012] And maybe that'll help you.
[time=3014] But there's only four options where we can go with this, right?
[time=3017] There's only four ways we can go.
[time=3019] The first one is, it's called the four "Ls." I don't know what it's classically called, but this is what was in my notes from school.
[time=3027] Number one is that Jesus was legend.
[time=3029] It's called legend lunatic liar or lord, four "Ls," right?
[time=3034] Legend.
[time=3035] There never was a Jesus who claimed to be God.
[time=3041] Now, if we have a sound mind and we look at just our world and our history, I mean, it's
[time=3050] really hard to deny that Jesus was just mere legend, right?
[time=3058] That he was just some guy born, maybe it was a little weird, but now this big legend grew out of these stories.
[time=3064] Or we look back at the history.
[time=3066] I mean, look at history, just not Christian history, but look at history of the world.
[time=3072] Look at how religion and the name of Christ has shaped so many societies and so many wars
[time=3079] even.
[time=3080] I mean, this cannot just be legend.
[time=3081] This cannot just be made up into this big old legend that has no validity to it.
[time=3088] There has to be that it's just, Jesus is too big of an influence to just be mere legend.
[time=3095] The second one, lunatic.
[time=3097] Jesus really thought he was God, but he was wrong.
[time=3103] But when we look at the scriptures and we look at the character we see from Jesus and we look at the miracles that took place, just doesn't seem plausible that he was a lunatic.
[time=3116] That he just kind of, a little in balance, he just thought he was God.
[time=3120] Just doesn't seem plausible.
[time=3121] The third one is that he was a liar, that he just deliberately deceived people.
[time=3127] I don't think that's true.
[time=3130] Again, the miracles and the sheer outcome of his life.
[time=3134] I mean, there's a lot of people who lie and they'll go a long way to keep that lie going, but to go through what he did on the cross and even right before the cross, I don't think
[time=3145] he's going to go all that way.
[time=3149] I don't think so.
[time=3151] You know, most people wouldn't endure that.
[time=3155] So the fourth option that he is actually Lord, fully God and fully man, Lord, that he was
[time=3164] God in the flesh seems to be possible.
[time=3170] See, the cool part about this core understanding, this theology is when we look at the stories
[time=3179] and the New Testament, when we kind of step back and we put this idea that Jesus was God
[time=3186] in the flesh, the stories take on some new, more powerful meanings.
[time=3192] When we think about the woman at the well, when Jesus, I think he bent down and wrote something on the ground, we don't know what he wrote.
[time=3200] Maybe he was playing tic-tac-toe, I'm not sure.
[time=3203] But he bent down and he said nobody's left to stone this lady and he says go and send them more.
[time=3209] That's God standing on the planet.
[time=3214] When we look at the parable of the prodigal son, right, and you have the son who goes
[time=3220] off and he squanders and the father who gave him the inheritance and the older son who's all upset and all of that whole story and we step back and say, who's telling that story?
[time=3230] It's God standing on the planet who's telling of the forgiveness and the party that this son has returned.
[time=3237] It's God.
[time=3238] I mean, these stories explode when we step back and remember that Jesus is fully human
[time=3245] and fully God.
[time=3247] In one person, the Bible just explodes.
[time=3253] And John chapter 1 verse 14 and the word became flesh and dwelt among us.
[time=3261] We have seen his glory, glory of the only son from the father, full of grace and truth.
[time=3267] See, this isn't just a visitation.
[time=3269] This isn't just coming down to check things out and then taking off.
[time=3273] This is an incarnation.
[time=3276] He, God, became human being in Jesus of Nazareth.
[time=3280] See, this paradox is amazing.
[time=3282] The Creator assumed the human frailty of his creatures.
[time=3287] God, and all his glory and all that he had just happening up there, wherever God resides,
[time=3295] heaven, his world, right?
[time=3299] He comes down.
[time=3302] Assume the human frailty of his creatures.
[time=3304] The eternal one.
[time=3305] God is eternal.
[time=3306] He has no end.
[time=3307] He has no beginning.
[time=3308] He just is entered time.
[time=3314] The all-powerful made himself vulnerable, all-powerful, made himself vulnerable to ridicule
[time=3322] and beatings and death.
[time=3326] The holy one made room for temptation.
[time=3329] God came down and made room for temptation.
[time=3336] And in the end, he died.
[time=3342] Jesus asked him as disciples, "Who do people say that I am?" And they told him, "John the Baptist, others say Elijah and others, one of the prophets, either they say some stuff." And then Jesus asked him, "But who do you say, who do you say that I am?"
[time=3361] And Peter answered him, "You are the Christ.
[time=3366] You are the Christ." Peter stands in a personal relationship with Jesus, God in the flesh.
[time=3375] And isn't confessing about an abstract institution or getting an answer right on a quiz or spotting
[time=3383] off the right answer to the Sunday school lesson?
[time=3386] No, Peter is not confessing about Christ.
[time=3389] Peter is confessing to Christ as God, Savior, and man.
[time=3399] So let me ask you this as we close.
[time=3403] So who do you say Jesus Christ is?
[time=3409] The answer or the question in your brain does that reflect the habits and the lifestyle
[time=3418] that you're living?
[time=3420] Jesus Christ, fully man and fully God.
[time=3425] Who do you say that Christ is?
[time=3428] Let's pray.
[time=3430] Father, God, thank you that not only did you create the world, not only did you make this
[time=3438] world beautiful and awesome and lovely, but you returned to redeem and restore yourself.
[time=3450] You came down in the person of God, in the person of Christ, and you died on the cross,
[time=3457] and you made eternal life for us, you made us being able to know you the one true God
[time=3463] and that personal relationship possible.
[time=3466] God, we are just, we stand in all of your truth.
[time=3469] We stand in all of the depths that that truth and where that truth can take us.
[time=3475] We pray that we will not be the same because your love and your grace is working in us.
[time=3483] They are lies proclaim that Christ is God.
[time=3490] [AMEN]
