[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] [MUSIC - 140 seconds]
[time=176] - Man.
[time=179] (audience applauds) - Would you in honor of God's word, would you stand?
[time=194] And let me read to you this morning from this glorious chapter that we've been so many of us in the room.
[time=201] We've been reading this as the days go by.
[time=204] We've began our study of it last week.
[time=207] I've encouraged you to just beg God to allow its truth to begin to seep into the way you think and the way you choose.
[time=215] And our hope again this morning is that God will use this as well as the clip from the film that we'll view here in a moment to continue to shape our hearts and our ministry and our priorities toward the heart of God.
[time=231] God says to Isaiah, Isaiah cry loudly, do not hold back, raise your voice like a trumpet
[time=242] and declare to my people their transgression the house of Jacob, their sins.
[time=250] And people confused in verse three.
[time=254] Cry out to God, why have we fasted?
[time=256] And you do not see why have we humbled ourselves and you do not notice what's going on God.
[time=265] It says in verse four, behold you fast.
[time=268] God's response, behold you fast for contention and strife and to strike with a wicked fist.
[time=277] They had it all wrong.
[time=278] Verse six, is this not the fast?
[time=280] God says which I choose?
[time=283] This is what spirituality looks like.
[time=286] In my mind God says to loosen the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke and to let the oppressed go free and break every yoke, every burden.
[time=298] Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into the house when you see the naked to cover him and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?
[time=310] When this happens, when you do it my way
[time=316] then your light will break out like the dawn and your recovery will speedily spring forth and your righteousness will go before you and the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard.
[time=334] Would you just look at the screen this morning and can we pray this together?
[time=337] I'll pray a line and then would you just repeat after me and we'll just gonna make our way through this declaration to God this morning as a family.
[time=346] Would you just repeat after me, oh gracious God and heavenly Father, you've seen our sin.
[time=356] You're intimately aware of my own transgressions.
[time=365] Our spirituality is too often a poor reflection of your heart for those in darkness and in need.
[time=377] Oh God, we long for our light to break out
[time=386] for our recovery to spring forth.
[time=394] For our righteousness to go before us and for your glory to be our protection.
[time=405] Allow the scriptures this morning to dwell in us richly.
[time=413] Cause us to be willing doers of your word.
[time=425] Not just listeners.
[time=427] God, may we no longer have it within us.
[time=432] To turn a blind eye or a cold heart
[time=440] to that which breaks yours.
[time=444] Transform us this morning we pray.
[time=451] And everybody agreed and said, amen, you can be seated.
[time=456] Thank you, Chris.
[time=458] Hey, we wanna just give you a moment here.
[time=463] A few minutes to watch this clip for those of you who weren't here last week.
[time=467] We'll be viewing as the weeks go by here, clips from a major motion picture released recently by Compassion International.
[time=474] It's entitled Live 58.
[time=476] It's about living out the truth of the very passage that we're studying.
[time=480] We view it almost as supplemental teaching for our times together over these weeks.
[time=486] It is a powerful picture of what is currently transpiring in our world and the way in which the church can respond.
[time=494] If you missed last week, I just want you to know you can view last week's full service and clip, clip number one on the website at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=503] Watch, listen and take in this morning and then we'll come back to our passage.
[time=509] (gentle music)
[time=540] It's really amazing West to be walking here and that's very mount of Olives.
[time=547] I mean, this very location is where Jesus was overcome with grief as he looked across the Jerusalem and couldn't help himself.
[time=554] He just wept over the sea.
[time=556] This is a setting where he actually spoke
[time=562] this incredible, powerful teaching in Matthew chapter 25 about the kingdom of heaven.
[time=568] He says, and so when the son of man comes in all of his glory, I mean, this guy is split open and we're told that all the nations of the earth are going to gather before him.
[time=580] Then the king is going to separate one from the other.
[time=584] And when this huge process is done, then the king is going to say, now this is what this was all about.
[time=593] It's what the prophets have talked about.
[time=595] It's how I lived my life.
[time=597] It is what my scriptures are filled with 2000 verses about this.
[time=601] It should come as no surprise.
[time=603] This is about the poor, how extremely important they are to me and he will have separated them by what not what did you think, not what did you pray about, what were you concerned about, but what did you actually do?
[time=617] And so this powerful passage was taught on this location
[time=623] in this beautiful scenery and the bottom line messages, the poor really, really matter to me.
[time=631] And those of us who are followers of Christ, we simply don't have the option when it comes to the poor of doing nothing.
[time=638] And this is the message of God for us today,
[time=644] that God is a God of love, God who loves all people equally and that when we see one person hurting and oppressed, then I am oppressed if I don't do anything about it.
[time=658] And when we are looking at our friends in the West, affluent people in affluent societies, they also have a responsibility.
[time=669] Despite the wealth that dominates so much of the West, many still struggle to balance their finances.
[time=677] Kirsty is a young teacher and dressmaker from the UK.
[time=682] She told us how issues of self-esteem and materialism have often been a challenge for her, to the point that she found herself caught into a debt that she couldn't pay off.
[time=692] - I built up a lot of debt over the years.
[time=695] I've always struggled with handling my money.
[time=697] I remember when I got paid my first job when I was 16 and blew my paycheck within the first day.
[time=701] And I remember that feeling of getting to a point where it was all out of control and I'd wake up either in the middle of the night or first thing in the morning and have that sick feeling of how am I ever going to get out of this.
[time=713] But the majority that was spent on trying to alter or improve my image.
[time=719] But I went to university in the center of London and I went to fashion college and that was by far the biggest challenge as I wanted to not so much fit in, but I wanted to have the right image.
[time=733] And I did have a low self-esteem and I just felt that everything was centered around what I looked like.
[time=738] And that was where I placed my hope in me and my future was in those things.
[time=743] - Kirstie made a decision to change her life.
[time=746] She began by cutting up her credit cards one Sunday in front of her church and now is opening her eyes to a bigger world.
[time=754] - I'm cutting down on some of my spend.
[time=756] I've been able to free up some money to be able to support others.
[time=759] I was determined to open up my eyes a little bit more and broaden my perspective.
[time=767] - I had the opportunity to go to Kenya to see some of the work that my church were involved with.
[time=772] And we came and arrived at the church and met Pastor Joel and his team and he started to show us around the community and then talk about the work that they're doing there.
[time=782] - So where are we going down to now?
[time=784] - This is our river.
[time=785] It's a dead river.
[time=788] You don't find anything that lives there, not even a frog.
[time=793] Of course it's very much contaminated.
[time=797] No, even not even germs.
[time=798] Sometimes we joke that not even germs can live in our river because it's too toxic.
[time=805] - Cursed his local church has connected with the work of Pastor Joel and his church in the Mathari Valley proving fruitful for both sides.
[time=815] For the UK church, the link has become a focus for prayer and an opportunity for them to engage.
[time=821] For the church in Mathari, the support is a great source of encouragement.
[time=827] The church is a source of hope and inspiration for many in the congregation and also in the community at large.
[time=836] We have things like the Marnos children that we work with, bringing them to the church kitchen and feeding them with a well-balanced diet and teaching their parents how to feed these children.
[time=850] We want to keep the young people busy with some activities.
[time=855] For example, we teach them the guitar, teach them the piano.
[time=859] There's a dance troupe.
[time=860] We have several of them in the Santa school.
[time=863] We also have football and we go out to national level in competition.
[time=869] That kind of interaction and good positive usage of their energy.
[time=874] We also have vocational training for the young people and also for the women that they can learn some simple skills that they can be able to improve their lives.
[time=886] One of the people that I met was a lovely lady called Anastasia and she was working on the side of the road and she talked a bit about her life as a single mum living in this place and the sewing business is her income and she's known as a local designer and she has people bring stuff to her and she fixes them or she makes things some scratch and she talked about being in a place where there's so many challenges of trying to make ends meet but also doing a job that she clearly loves.
[time=914] That one conversation which lasted 15 minutes was one of the most powerful conversations I've had with somebody.
[time=921] There was me out there thinking, "What can I do to help?" And I think we often think that we can go to these places and think, "What can we do to help?" But there's a massive amount that they can help us with.
[time=931] And I saw people that were in strife
[time=937] and had no money and were really struggling to make ends meet but had hope and they were placing their hope and God.
[time=943] And all this time I've been placing my hope in things.
[time=947] Their faith is so much stronger yet they had virtually nothing.
[time=952] And there was me actually everything around me and my faith wasn't where it should have been.
[time=957] For me, the blessing I've had and that I am having is that my relationship with him is growing deeper and deeper and stronger and stronger.
[time=967] I can look through the years and see.
[time=971] God can make a change in somebody's life, where I am right now.
[time=978] I am a testimony in the valley.
[time=980] I was born to a home where we were 16 children.
[time=985] During that time, my mother used to brew a local brew.
[time=991] So to get food for us, I used to smoke, used to drink, used to fight a lot.
[time=997] I wanted somebody to stop me from doing what I was doing.
[time=1001] Since I received Christ, I was able to go to school, even moved out of the valley.
[time=1007] But the Lord now called me from all that I was doing to come back to the valley and give hope to the children.
[time=1014] Tell them it can be done.
[time=1016] If you come to Christ, it's possible to change you alive.
[time=1021] And we have seen it happening.
[time=1023] I'm always talking to them and telling them, "Guys, I'm just one of you.
[time=1027] "I'm just one of you. It has happened to me.
[time=1028] "And it can happen to you, too." Sadly, for many young people, the absence of good role models means they get into violent gangs, which are fueled by social deprivation and poverty.
[time=1042] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=1055] (speaking in foreign language) - Ory was once a feared gang member
[time=1066] and paid a sass in Brazil, who took many drugs and spent every day of his life in fear.
[time=1071] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=1085] (speaking in foreign language) - But Ory found Christ
[time=1097] and now helps other addicts to come off drugs and escape from the gang culture.
[time=1102] Working deep in communities dominated by dangerous gangs, he's inspiring those around him to see that they, too, can change their lives.
[time=1113] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=1204] - Well, weeks three and four will only intensify.
[time=1209] I promise you that as we look at what's going on in our world today, that which stirs and breaks the heart of God and the opportunity we as the church have to respond.
[time=1219] If you'll open your Bibles this morning to Isaiah 58, here's what I wanna do.
[time=1223] I wanna teach you this morning.
[time=1225] I wanna teach you and help you see straight from the text of Isaiah 58, some things that I believe God desperately wants you to understand and wants us to see and apply to our lives.
[time=1238] I'm very grateful for Steve Gardner and Steve Longbreak and Phil Ferguson.
[time=1243] Right now, second hour, they're down the hall in their first Sunday morning of double exposure, doing that very thing.
[time=1249] They're teaching what we taught first hour and furthering that lesson in the hearts and lives of folks down there.
[time=1256] If you were gonna go and you forgot, boy, I hope you'll go next week.
[time=1259] Come join us first hour and then join that group as they apply immediately the teaching from first hour into the everyday of their lives right down the hallway in room 176.
[time=1270] But this morning, I wanna show you some things right from the text here.
[time=1274] And I want you to understand that when the fast,
[time=1280] when the spiritual activity of the Israelites was wrong,
[time=1286] when it was misdirected, when the fast was wrong, when the Israelites outward expressions of spirituality lacked internal spiritual integrity, they were negating four things.
[time=1299] And I want you just to, we're gonna focus our time this morning on these four things that were getting diminished, these four things that were getting canceled out, these four things that were getting negated when the people of God missed the heart of God and the way they came at life and ministry.
[time=1318] And these are four things, my friends, as we talk about them, as I teach them to you this morning, you will see clearly, as I have all week long, that these are four things you do not wanna go without.
[time=1331] These are four things we desperately need.
[time=1333] And so here we go.
[time=1334] Look for yourself, verses six and seven.
[time=1337] Verses six and seven, is this not the fast which I, God choose to loosen the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free.
[time=1350] There it speaks to those who have been unjustly imprisoned, undoing the bands of the yoke, letting the oppressed go free, break every burden, every yoke.
[time=1360] Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless into the house when you see the naked to cover him and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?
[time=1373] In other words, God says, if you live like this, if you serve like this, if you sacrifice and extend kindness and generosity like this, then and only then will the realities of verse eight be experienced in your life.
[time=1394] And if you don't live like six and seven, you will miss the realities.
[time=1401] You will go without the realities of verse eight, what does verse eight say?
[time=1407] If you live like this, then, then your light will break out like the dawn.
[time=1412] And your recovery will speedily spring forth and your righteousness will go before you and the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard.
[time=1424] So here we go, four things you don't wanna have negated, four things you want to have going on in your life, then and only then will your light break out like the dawn.
[time=1436] Will you write that down then and only then will your light break out like the dawn?
[time=1442] One of the great longstanding illustrations found throughout the pages of scripture is this picture of God's people being lights.
[time=1450] We sang about it as kids, this little light of mine.
[time=1456] I'm gonna let it what, hide it under a bushel, what?
[time=1461] No, I'm gonna let it shine.
[time=1463] God designed you, my friends.
[time=1465] God has divinely designed you as a believer, as a follower of his son, as a Christian to reflect, to possess, to reflect, to pass along his light.
[time=1478] Listen, you have been designed by God to reflect and pass along his light in whatever circumstance you enter.
[time=1487] You're to pass along the light of truth whenever you bump up against a lie.
[time=1494] You're to pass along the truth, the light of his kindness
[time=1500] whenever you bump up against depression.
[time=1502] You and I are to pass along the light of hope whenever we bump into despair.
[time=1507] We're to take light into dark places marked by injustice and sin.
[time=1512] This is the heart of God.
[time=1515] This is what God has designed for us to do with this light that he's given us, John 812.
[time=1523] It'll be on the screen.
[time=1525] You can look there in your Bibles if you want, John 812.
[time=1528] Then Jesus again spoke to them saying, "I am the light of the world, and he who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the word there talks about possession.
[time=1542] We've told you about it in recent months internalized.
[time=1546] At the point of salvation, the light Christ himself comes and dwells in us.
[time=1552] We have this light within us, the light of Christ.
[time=1557] This divine illuminating force, John 812 refers to.
[time=1563] This divine illuminating force that brings what scientists will tell us.
[time=1568] Scientists will tell us that light, the process of lighting brings basically two things.
[time=1572] The process of lighting brings exposure and clarity.
[time=1576] And this is what the light of the truth.
[time=1580] This is what the light of Christ that indwells you.
[time=1584] And as you go into dark places, this is what transpires.
[time=1587] There is exposure and there is clarity.
[time=1590] It's interesting when you live 58, when you begin to practice verses six and seven, it doesn't just accomplish, watch this, it doesn't just accomplish clarity, justice making wrong what's right.
[time=1608] It also exposes the evil behind the injustice.
[time=1613] Exposing and bringing clarity,
[time=1619] the whole process of divine light and divine illumination, Ephesians 5, would you turn your New Testaments, go back to the fifth chapter of Ephesians, Ephesians 5, at eight and nine, and then I'm gonna show you a few more, 11 through 13.
[time=1634] Look at Ephesians 5, eight and nine.
[time=1636] As I read, note the defensive and offensive posture of the believer, Ephesians chapter five verse eight, for you were formerly, you used to be darkness, he says.
[time=1649] But now you are what?
[time=1651] Say it, church.
[time=1652] Now you are light.
[time=1654] You are light in the Lord.
[time=1655] Walk as children of light, for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth.
[time=1665] Do not, verse 11, do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead now even expose them.
[time=1675] For it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.
[time=1681] Look at verse 13, but all things become visible when they are exposed by the light for everything that becomes visible is light.
[time=1692] So participating, Paul says, so participating in the deeds of darkness is now out of the question.
[time=1697] Now that we've got that covered, Paul says, go to wherever you find dark deeds.
[time=1704] And with you are what did verse nine say?
[time=1707] And with your goodness and your righteousness and your truth, with your goodness, righteousness, and truth, light up what's wrong.
[time=1718] And I want to just stop right there.
[time=1723] And I want to just kind of quickly look all of you right in the eye.
[time=1727] There I got all of you.
[time=1728] Would you, would you do that?
[time=1735] Will, will you do that?
[time=1739] Do you, do you do that?
[time=1742] Maybe I should back up.
[time=1745] How does that sound to you?
[time=1748] That God is calling you with this light
[time=1755] that has been divinely granted to you.
[time=1759] He has called you to with that light, having forsaken the deeds of darkness, he now calls you to walk into dark places where these deeds of darkness are occurring.
[time=1773] Home, neighborhood, school, work, culture, community,
[time=1779] I don't know.
[time=1780] And he says that you, with this divine illuminating light are to expose
[time=1790] what goes on and what transpires and what takes place.
[time=1794] I love the Greek word for, I only give you a Greek when it, when I think it's helpful.
[time=1799] Boy, this is really insightful here.
[time=1801] The Greek word for expose means not just to bring to light, it means to bring the light to.
[time=1808] And he's talking to you.
[time=1812] Remember, he's talking to the people.
[time=1814] It's not some ethereal kind of conceptual deal.
[time=1817] He's talking to people who love God about bringing the light to darkness.
[time=1825] And when your heart and mind are in unison with the way God see things, this light thing, it's working when you're not, it's not.
[time=1836] I'll never forget my first year at the Masters College after a couple of years of some pretty intense wandering and that's another whole story, but God finally brought me to a place where he was really growing me and I came to faith in Christ and my roommate at the Masters College, a Christian college in Southern California was Scott and Scott was not only a basketball player with me, but he was an RA.
[time=1861] Remember, RA's in the dorm, the RA's, they were responsible for the floor and they oversaw all the guys.
[time=1868] And at the Masters College, he wasn't just responsible for all the doors getting locked and all the guys getting in, but he was responsible for their spiritual lives.
[time=1878] It was like a, almost like a floor pastor.
[time=1881] And I'll never forget a couple months into that semester, he calls me and he's down at the local Motel 6, a payphone out in the parking lot.
[time=1895] He's really sad, he's bummed out.
[time=1898] And he said, yeah, I'm down here and come to find out there were three guys from the dorm and three gals from another dorm and he had just watched them check into a room.
[time=1915] And he didn't think they were playing cards.
[time=1921] And he was just telling me, I gotta do something and I say, I'll be right down there.
[time=1927] So I drove down there real quick and we sat in this car for a few minutes and it was really, really sad about it.
[time=1934] And finally, he just kept saying to me, I gotta go up there.
[time=1937] I gotta go up there, he kept saying to me, I gotta, I just have to get up there and turn the lights on 'cause the lights had gone off.
[time=1944] And he kept saying to me, dude, I just, I gotta get up there, I gotta turn the lights on, I gotta do it.
[time=1950] So he gets out of his car, I say, I'll go with you.
[time=1952] He says, no, it's my responsibility.
[time=1954] And so I watched him walk across that parking lot up the stairs down the hall and I watched a door open and I watched lights go on.
[time=1963] And there was a sad deal and there was some trouble and there was some consequences and actually some good things came of it if I remember writing them weeks and months to come.
[time=1973] But I wrote this down this week and I wanna just make sure you understand this.
[time=1977] Scott did go up to the room and a light switch did get hit.
[time=1982] Bulbs did illumine and kids scattered like roaches.
[time=1988] It's true, but more than that, I just wanna make sure you understand.
[time=1991] Scott went into the room.
[time=1994] Scott who possessed the light of life.
[time=2002] Scott who possessed this light of truth walked in to a room that desperately needed to be walked into, amen?
[time=2013] And that's, that's what happens.
[time=2016] When your heart is aligned with God, Isaiah 58 tells the people of God, "Hey, when you get distant from the heart of God, "when you get caught up in doing the right things "for all the wrong reasons, you lose your light." Get back church.
[time=2036] Get back, do whatever it takes.
[time=2038] Move back to genuine spiritual activity.
[time=2041] And then your light, then your light will break out like the dawn, then with your light guiding the way you'll see to loosen the bonds of wickedness.
[time=2050] Undo the bands of the burden.
[time=2052] You'll reconnect with the kind of spirituality that God's truly about.
[time=2058] Then and only then will your light spring forth.
[time=2061] Secondly, when you live out verses six and seven back to Isaiah 58, when you live out verses six and seven and your heart and your life and your choices and your ministry begin to resemble the truth of Isaiah 58, six and seven, then and only then will your recovery speedily spring forth.
[time=2081] Then and only then it says will your, these are the words it uses, your recovery.
[time=2088] It says will speedily spring forth.
[time=2093] What do you think he's talking about?
[time=2097] When you hear someone talk about your recovery, sounds like he may think you're what?
[time=2103] Say it louder.
[time=2107] Yeah, look at Isaiah 33.
[time=2109] If you go to Isaiah 33 24, you see that you're exactly right.
[time=2114] For in Isaiah 33 24, it's a similar passage.
[time=2118] There's iniquity and sin that has been transpiring.
[time=2122] There have been patterns of living and choosing and approaching God that were inappropriate and sinful.
[time=2128] And so here we see in 33 24, as God deals with this and as the people begin to repent and move away from it, what does he say?
[time=2138] He says and no resident will say, I am what?
[time=2141] Say it, sick.
[time=2142] The people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity.
[time=2148] So there's this iniquity going on.
[time=2150] There's this activity that's not consistent with the heart of God and the result of this activity and this mindset and this living that's separated from the heart of God is sickness.
[time=2165] And he says, when you move away from that, the people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity and there won't be any more sickness.
[time=2176] When you get distant from the heart of God,
[time=2182] when you lose touch with living the life God designed for you, when you get consumed, listen, when you get consumed with you, when you get consumed with your own complaints, your own wants, your own needs, your own approach, your own agenda, when you get hard-hearted and externally preoccupied instead of soft-hearted and intimate with God in his ways, you can, the scriptures inform us this morning, you can get sick.
[time=2213] Physically, emotionally, maybe, I believe so.
[time=2223] Spiritually, certainly.
[time=2226] And this isn't the day that I'm gonna jump into a treatment of this massive issue of mental or emotional illness.
[time=2236] I'm not here to give you a treatise on that.
[time=2239] I certainly believe that mental illness exists, certainly.
[time=2243] And I certainly believe that there are physiological and personal issues that play into the struggles that folks have at a very deep and legitimate mental emotional level.
[time=2255] I do, I also believe that at times, it is a spiritual issue that can find relief through spiritual health and spiritual consideration.
[time=2267] And as I read this passage and as I come to this truth, it just strikes me that you can get sick.
[time=2275] You can get physically, emotionally, spiritually ill.
[time=2281] You can get depressed, you can get afflicted, you can get addicted, you can get obsessive, you can get despairing, you can get light less, which I think is sick, light less, no more light.
[time=2301] Everything's in, sick.
[time=2306] With your heart distant from God's priorities, you begin banking on outward appearance, do this, do that, do this, look like this, gotta look like this, gotta appear like that.
[time=2317] You begin neglecting the weight of your things, justice and mercy, like Jesus said in Matthew 23, you become legalistic, you become an externalist, you become fixated on what spiritual life looks like instead of what spiritual life is like.
[time=2337] And Jesus called these people out.
[time=2340] They were harsh and critical of others with hearts full of dead men's bones, they were sick.
[time=2347] And Isaiah 58 says, you wanna get well?
[time=2353] You wanna experience recovery?
[time=2357] You're sick Israel, you've moved away from my design.
[time=2361] Your activity doesn't at all reflect the things that I want you to be about, do you want to recover?
[time=2367] I want you to recover.
[time=2369] He says, and I'll have you recover speedily.
[time=2372] Go feed someone.
[time=2376] Go clothe someone.
[time=2379] And now at this point, I want you all to, and I know this is a tension we face as we watch films and as we read passages about the people of Israel.
[time=2387] Now I want you in these next few minutes to think about you and I want you to think about Fort Wayne.
[time=2393] And I want you to think about your block and I want you to think about your family and I want you to think about your workforce and I want you to think about the community you live in.
[time=2401] I want you to think about the context of your life and the opportunity.
[time=2408] And ask God to stretch your thinking.
[time=2412] Ask God to give you creativity if you need it.
[time=2416] Ask God to reveal to you things that maybe you've never ever before thought about.
[time=2424] On the application front, you want to recover, you want to get well, go feed someone.
[time=2432] You say, who, I don't know, think about it.
[time=2437] You think about it.
[time=2441] Who could you go feed?
[time=2443] It says in the text to feed them, those who are hungry.
[time=2448] Go clothe someone.
[time=2450] Go extend kindness to someone who's hurting.
[time=2453] Go pick someone up.
[time=2455] Go push back wickedness in someone's life who desperately needs you to just break into the room and turn the light on.
[time=2462] Go carry a burden.
[time=2465] Go write a note.
[time=2466] You want to get well, think more about them than you.
[time=2473] Have the posture of your life.
[time=2475] Have the direction of your activity and your thinking and your choosing be more about them than you.
[time=2484] And I want to just take a moment this morning, just a couple of minutes.
[time=2490] And I want to just, I want to pray for you.
[time=2492] We had a great time of prayer, first hour.
[time=2494] Would you just bow your heads, everybody in the room?
[time=2496] Just bow your heads real quick.
[time=2497] And I want to pray for those in the room this morning who are sick.
[time=2502] And I believe that there are some in the room this morning and you are experiencing this sickness.
[time=2509] You are experiencing the sickness that comes from being detached and distant from the heart of God.
[time=2517] You have adopted a way of life and you have adopted a way of relating.
[time=2522] You have adopted a way of living that has you utterly and absolutely consumed with you.
[time=2529] And God wants to bring speedy healing to you today.
[time=2538] And he wants you to understand that your recovery will be speedy when your heart is aligned with him and his heart is aligned to those in need.
[time=2549] So who's in need?
[time=2551] Oh God, I pray for my brothers and my sisters here this morning, young and old alike, got anybody in the room feeling the pain this morning of this sickness that comes from being disconnected
[time=2565] with your heart and your priorities.
[time=2568] Oh God, I pray that in a loving and careful way you would reveal to them things they've never ever before thought of, I pray God that you would reveal to them things they've been purposefully ignoring.
[time=2579] God, I pray that as they read through verses six and verses seven that you would open up to them in their hearts and minds, opportunity after opportunity.
[time=2591] Maybe it's an attitude, adjustment.
[time=2593] Maybe it's someone in their own home.
[time=2596] Maybe it's a group of people down the street.
[time=2598] Maybe it's them going across the world with us.
[time=2601] I don't know, but oh God, I pray this morning that you would make it clear and that you would give them the strength to move toward repentance.
[time=2609] Repentance away from the sin of self.
[time=2612] Repentance toward the embracing of your heart and your posture, which is others centered.
[time=2620] It's gracious, it's generous, it's kind, it's giving.
[time=2625] Oh God, do this kind of work in us this morning.
[time=2628] We pray in your son's name, amen.
[time=2632] Then and only then, says right there in verse eight, we're just teaching our way through this verse.
[time=2638] Then and only then will your light break out.
[time=2642] Then and only then will your recovery speedily spring forth and then look at number three, then and only then will your righteousness go before you.
[time=2651] Your righteousness go before you.
[time=2654] What does righteousness mean?
[time=2656] I want you to just jot this down, selfless sacrifice.
[time=2659] There's a number of definitions we could give you.
[time=2661] That's one I want you to hold on to.
[time=2663] Righteousness has to do with a selflessness.
[time=2667] Obviously it comes from Christ.
[time=2669] Righteousness, jot it down, selfless sacrifice.
[time=2672] When you are fast, he says in Isaiah 58, when your spiritual activity is in line with the heart of God.
[time=2680] I want to say it to you this way this morning church.
[time=2682] You'll lead, you'll lead with righteousness.
[time=2687] When your heart is in alignment with the priorities
[time=2693] that God has, you will lead with selfless sacrifice.
[time=2698] It'll mark and characterize your first steps,
[time=2704] your first thoughts, your first response, your lead with righteousness.
[time=2711] When your heart is distant from God, guess what you lead with?
[time=2715] A selfish agenda, a selfish agenda.
[time=2721] You say, well, what does leading with a selfish agenda look like?
[time=2725] What would it be like if my first thoughts or my first responses were a selfish agenda?
[time=2731] Well, here you go, leading with a selfish agenda.
[time=2735] It's saying to yourself, when you see need or pain, and I don't think these are gonna come on the screen, I'm gonna just say these, and hopefully as I just say them, you can just kind of take it in and we can just think about it for a moment, leading with a selfish agenda.
[time=2750] Not a righteous one, is when you see need or pain
[time=2756] and say something like this, you know what?
[time=2760] That's their problem.
[time=2767] And so many of you in the room, and the guy standing in front of you as well, have said that.
[time=2776] Just raise your hand, you've said that, haven't you?
[time=2780] Go ahead.
[time=2781] Yeah, you've said that, you've thought that.
[time=2784] We say that, we think that.
[time=2786] It's their problem.
[time=2789] And as I say that, and as I think that through, wrote a few things down, think what kind of came to the top was just the simple reality that God didn't ask me whose problem it was.
[time=2802] Did he?
[time=2806] I don't hear God asking you.
[time=2810] Hey, by the way, when you see that, when you encounter that, or when you encounter cold water and St. Joe's Center, wherever you are, I don't hear God saying, hey, by the way, whose problem is that?
[time=2826] No.
[time=2827] We say that's their problem, selfish agenda.
[time=2830] We say, I've worked too hard for what's mine to share it.
[time=2834] You think that, I know you do, 'cause I do.
[time=2838] I've worked too hard for what's mine to now share it as I come in contact with his need or pain.
[time=2848] I understand that, and all I would ask you to consider is simply this, whatever it is, you have worked too hard for what's mine.
[time=2859] Whatever it is you have, I would just ask you to consider who's is it.
[time=2865] I'm not trying to be tricky.
[time=2868] I just, you gotta think that one through.
[time=2872] It really is an issue of ownership and stewardship, and if you start white knuckling everything you earned and you start calling it yours, that could get a little dicey.
[time=2885] It's problematic.
[time=2888] What does leading with a selfish agenda look like?
[time=2893] Sometimes you say, and sometimes I say to ourselves, they must have done something to deserve.
[time=2902] They must have done something to deserve their struggle, to which the Spirit of God quickly whispers into your glorious, pristine, perfect life.
[time=2915] Hey, so tell me, Kelly, what did you do to deserve all your blessing?
[time=2922] They did something to deserve their struggle.
[time=2927] What did you do to deserve your blessing?
[time=2932] Good things for us to think through.
[time=2934] They made their bed now they're sleeping in it.
[time=2937] Sometimes you think, and sometimes you say, and sometimes I think and say, if I give them resource, what will they really use it for?
[time=2945] All of a sudden we're the greatest stewards in the world, right?
[time=2950] All of a sudden we wanna really make sure every penny gets spent wisely.
[time=2956] If I give them the resource, what will they really use it for?
[time=2960] I was reading this week and it reminded me of an old mentor of mine who used to say this very thing on this very subject.
[time=2967] He used to say that he used to ask the question, is that exchange, this exchange of a buck?
[time=2975] This exchange of a meal, this exchange of some resource,
[time=2982] he used to say, is that exchange right there?
[time=2985] Is it really about the resource given?
[time=2989] Is that what that's really about?
[time=2990] Or is it about the opportunity for the heart of God to be revealed in that moment?
[time=2997] And I believe with all my heart it's the latter.
[time=3002] I do understand that resources are part of that scenario.
[time=3006] I think sometimes we get focused on the exchange of the resource and we forget that in those moments we get a chance as his people to align ourselves and reflect through the light that's in us, the very heart of God for those in need.
[time=3021] If I give, sometimes we think and say this, if I give, if I help, won't it just enable them?
[time=3028] It could, I don't know.
[time=3036] It has, it hasn't, it does, it doesn't.
[time=3042] I don't know that that's the question.
[time=3045] I don't know that it's about the resource exchange that I'm not sure it's about ongoing enablement.
[time=3050] I know these are things that we think of but sometimes I wonder why we think them.
[time=3054] Gary, what was the phrase you taught me
[time=3060] in between services, deferred what?
[time=3062] Diffusion of responsibility.
[time=3065] It's another thing that comes up.
[time=3068] Diffusion of responsibility.
[time=3070] You see the need, you see the pain and you're just convinced someone else will come along and take care of it.
[time=3078] And here's the last one I just wrote down which is just a, ah, it's just not so good I don't think.
[time=3086] I don't think it carries a lot of weight.
[time=3089] When I watch how you spend yours and when you see how I spend mine, this last one doesn't, doesn't really work.
[time=3097] I don't have the time.
[time=3101] I just don't think that's, I don't think that's necessarily true and I think there's probably time in your day and there's probably time in my day.
[time=3112] There's probably time in our lives to responsibly and lovingly do, say, enact something.
[time=3120] Listen, church, whenever the church encounters the burdened,
[time=3130] whenever you and I meet up with injustice or poverty, if for whatever reason you see the hungry, thirsty or the naked, God's word implores you this morning and I beg you as your friend and pastor, lead with righteousness.
[time=3147] First steps, first thoughts, lead with righteousness.
[time=3153] You know, I don't think it's by chance, open your Bibles, please, go to our turn in your Bibles, most of them I know are open.
[time=3160] Go to 25, Matthew 25, 41, I wanna read this to you.
[time=3163] I don't think it's a coincidence at all that he uses this word and I'm gonna read you this passage and at the end we're gonna get to this one word and this one word's gonna, I think, help you understand the very thing we just talked about, leading with righteousness, selfless sacrifice.
[time=3179] In Matthew 25, 41, West Stafford referred to it in the clip this morning.
[time=3186] Jesus has come, he has divided the nations, he has come back and he is bringing judgment and he's straightening some things out and on the one side are those who acted compassionately toward those in need and on the other side are those who did not act compassionately, those who passed, those who were too busy, those who were worried about enabling, those who had worked too hard to share what they had made, all of those are on the other side and so Jesus says to all of those who passed on compassion, he says, then he will say to those on his left, depart from me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels.
[time=3233] It just got real serious.
[time=3238] For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in naked and you did not clothe me sick and in prison and you did not visit me.
[time=3252] Then they themselves also will answer, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or a naked or sick or in prison and did not take care of you?
[time=3263] Then he will answer them, truly I say to you to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these.
[time=3273] You did not do it to me and here you go, these will go away into eternal punishment, but the what, say it, but the righteous, but the righteous once, the self-sacrificing once, says there will go into eternal life.
[time=3304] Then and only then, be with me, then and only then will you experience the realities of verse eight.
[time=3315] Back to Isaiah 58 and would you just stand with me this morning as we get ready to go, Isaiah 58, then and only then will your righteousness go before you?
[time=3326] And then lastly I wanna just share this with you as we go.
[time=3329] And then lastly, then and only then, will the glory of the Lord be your rear guard?
[time=3336] Then and only then will you be protected by the glory of the Lord?
[time=3342] The glory of the glory of the Lord, the glory of God in Isaiah's time and in the life and history of Israel that would have been immediately connected with this idea of the Shekinah glory.
[time=3355] There was this cloud, there was this brightness, there was this covering that went with them, wherever they went, it was this sign of strength, it was this sign of identification between a God and his people, it was this thing of protection, it was this symbol that basically said, those are my people, here is my glory and I've got them.
[time=3377] I've got 'em and I love how it reads there
[time=3383] at the very end of our verse this morning, the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard.
[time=3389] I've got your back.
[time=3393] You go forward.
[time=3396] You go forward, you shine your light, right?
[time=3400] You shine your light, you lead with sacrifice, you get well and I got your back.
[time=3408] The glory of the Lord for those whose hearts and priorities are aligned with the heart of God as revealed in Isaiah 58, 6 and 7 and the verses to come, I can't wait to get there as we continue to explore what this looks like.
[time=3426] Our Father in Heaven, we stand before you this morning of people who I think most of us in the room would say, we desire God to not negate these four things, we long for these four realities to be present in our lives.
[time=3439] And O God, I pray that as we move from this place into the rest of our day and the oncoming week is we commit to read again and again and again these words, this passage, God, this chapter.
[time=3453] May you instill not only the truth of it but the application of it.
[time=3458] O God, give us ideas.
[time=3461] God, give us a vision.
[time=3462] God, give us an understanding of what we should do and how we should do it and where we should go to apply these things that would represent your heart in ministry and life.
[time=3474] God, thank you for the privilege of being together this morning.
[time=3477] Thank you for the remembrance of your son and his sacrifice.
[time=3480] Thank you for the sweet privilege of worship.
[time=3483] And we look forward to being together again soon if that be your will.
[time=3487] And all the people in the room agreed and said amen.
[time=3490] (upbeat music)
