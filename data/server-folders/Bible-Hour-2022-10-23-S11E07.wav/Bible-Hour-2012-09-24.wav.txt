[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=33] It's great to be with you.
[time=34] My name's Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege of being part of the team here at Black Hawk, and we have the privilege each and every week to bring you this broadcast, hopefully a broadcast that encourages you as we continue to teach God's word, that life-changing, eternity-altering word of God that we're so grateful we get to have.
[time=56] Hey, if you know me at all, and if you know Black Hawk at all, you know that we are so grateful for the chance God gives us to be a part of transformation, lives being changed, lives being restored.
[time=71] And when I think about restoration, I can't help but think about my good friend, one of my best friends in the whole world, Dr. Mitchell Cruz.
[time=79] Mitch and I have been friends for years.
[time=81] And Mitch, over the last several years, God has given them this ministry.
[time=85] It's called Restoration Road.
[time=87] He wrote a book called The Restoration Road.
[time=89] There's a television show on Sunday mornings here in town on our sister station, NBC 33, 730.
[time=96] You oughta watch it, you oughta set your alarm every week, you oughta never miss it.
[time=101] And I wanna have you go to restorationroad.com.
[time=104] That's right, it's right here on the bottom of the screen, restorationroad.com.
[time=109] Go there, and if you go to the website, you could just at your own leisure whenever you want, click on videos, where you could see interviews with Mitch and other people from here and all around the world as they share their story of restoration, ways in which God has miraculously and significantly restored that which is broken.
[time=131] He has made new that which is worn and old.
[time=135] He has brought back to life those things that desperately needed his touch.
[time=141] And the way Mitch does this, the way that ministry reaches people, it's absolutely phenomenal.
[time=147] And I don't want you to miss it.
[time=150] We love what Mitch is doing.
[time=152] And at Blackhawk, we counted a privilege to have him as our friend.
[time=156] So don't miss it.
[time=157] Restoration Road Sunday mornings at 730.
[time=160] Go to the website, be hugely encouraged.
[time=163] And thank you again for tuning in here.
[time=165] We're having a great time making our way through Isaiah 58 and this film, Live 58.
[time=172] Both the text and the film are challenging us in ways that we desperately need to be challenged.
[time=178] And I hope you'll continue walking with us on this current journey we find ourselves on.
[time=183] God bless you.
[time=183] And as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=879] I want to encourage you guys this morning to fasten your seatbelt to your, your in for a ride today.
[time=889] I'm so proud to be part of this church, never more than today.
[time=894] I've said that before and it's still true. I'm still proud.
[time=899] We want to be clear with you as a church, the elders, the staff.
[time=904] We want to be clear to you about a couple of things. We've been journeying through Isaiah 58 in recent weeks.
[time=910] Isaiah 58 is a passage regarding the people of Israel's treatment of the poor and how it was lacking.
[time=917] And God's indictment for the prophet Isaiah of this disastrous oversight.
[time=925] A few months ago, about three months ago, exactly, we talked about justice in an untouchables series
[time=932] and how the church just often just is uncomfortable with these issues and talking, we just don't know what to do about them.
[time=940] And here's one way in which I think Isaiah 58 runs the risk if we're not very careful
[time=946] of being confusing.
[time=948] The chapter again, let's read from Isaiah 58 first so you know what we're talking about.
[time=952] And as you turn there, I want to give you an opportunity.
[time=956] I want to tell you about an opportunity.
[time=958] Grow Groups is coming up starting on October 21st.
[time=962] That's not long from now.
[time=965] And you'll hear a lot more of the next three Sundays about it.
[time=967] But we're doing Grow Groups now on Sunday mornings, first hour on the north campus.
[time=971] And we've got several exciting opportunities.
[time=973] A couple of those in particular are directly connected to an opportunity for you to respond in smaller communities to this call of God to be a missional servant,
[time=984] to pursue justice in the world.
[time=986] So be listening for that.
[time=987] You'll be hearing a lot more about it from us in recent days.
[time=990] Grow Groups October 21st, first hour, nine o'clock across the street.
[time=995] Isaiah 58.
[time=999] This is God talking to Isaiah.
[time=1002] You've got to be careful in Isaiah because there's all kinds of different voice changes.
[time=1005] God's talking to Isaiah.
[time=1006] Isaiah's talking himself, talking to the people.
[time=1009] Look at verse one, God talking to Isaiah.
[time=1012] "Cry loudly, Isaiah.
[time=1014] Do not hold back.
[time=1016] Raise your voice like a trumpet and declare to my people their transgression."
[time=1023] A transgression is a word that means there is the line and I go right across it.
[time=1028] Declared to my people their transgression and to the house of Jacob their sins.
[time=1035] Verse two, "Yet they seek me day by day and delight to know my ways.
[time=1039] As a nation that has done righteousness, has not forsaken the ordinance of their God.
[time=1046] They ask me for just decisions and this is what strikes me." The last phrase here.
[time=1051] "They delight in the nearness of God." This is part of his indictment of them.
[time=1060] This is the people of Israel now talking in response.
[time=1062] Verse three, "Why have we fasted and you don't see?
[time=1065] Why have we humbled ourselves and you don't notice?
[time=1069] Behold on the day of your fast, you find your desire and drive hard all your workers.
[time=1074] Behold you fast for contention and strife and to strike with a wicked fist.
[time=1078] You don't fast like you do today to make your voice hurt on high.
[time=1083] Is it a fast like this which I choose?
[time=1085] A day for a man to humble himself.
[time=1087] Is it for bowing one's head like a reed and for spreading out sackcloth and ashes as a bed?
[time=1093] Will you call this a fast, even an acceptable day to the Lord?" Strong language.
[time=1099] Verse six, "Is this not the fast which I choose to loosen the bonds of wickedness,
[time=1106] to undo the bands of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, to break every yoke." Verse seven, "To divide your bread with the hungry, to bring the homeless poor into the house when you see the naked to cover him and not to hide yourself from your own flesh."
[time=1125] All of that, dear friends, is costly.
[time=1131] I was talking to a person before first service today who talked about a kindness he had done ten years ago that was very costly to he and his family and that kindness in the form of a brother and sister visited them in recent days and came to know Christ.
[time=1147] Let's be careful.
[time=1152] We sang the gospel just now.
[time=1154] Loud and clear.
[time=1156] I was singing loud down there with my friend Kelly.
[time=1159] We were singing it loud.
[time=1160] War is over.
[time=1162] Love has won.
[time=1163] Do you believe that?
[time=1166] I didn't hear you very well.
[time=1168] But it's true.
[time=1170] So in light of that, in light of the gospel, the good news of the gospel that Christ has come and done everything necessary for my salvation, I ought to live in a certain way.
[time=1182] There's a proper relationship, friends, between faith and works.
[time=1186] And we have to be very diligent about this and we as elders and again, and staff, we want to be careful to communicate to you clearly about it.
[time=1193] The economy with God is not that I undo the bands of the yoke and I bring the homeless poor into my house and I give them bread and then God likes me and wants me to be on his team.
[time=1203] Look at what you've done.
[time=1204] Isn't that wonderful?
[time=1205] Come be on my team.
[time=1207] It's not how it works.
[time=1208] Our good works don't flow into salvation.
[time=1211] Our good works, dear friends, flow out from salvation.
[time=1216] And I think that we are appropriately nervous about threatening a salvation of grace.
[time=1221] It's by grace through faith.
[time=1224] We're nervous about threatening that and we should be.
[time=1227] But the pendulum swings the other direction and we say we at least imply that there can be a salvation with no works at all.
[time=1235] And that's not the case.
[time=1238] Verse 10 in Ephesians 2 comes after verses 8 and 9.
[time=1241] I thought I would help you with that.
[time=1243] And it says, for we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works.
[time=1250] That's said after that we're saved by grace through faith.
[time=1254] We are not as a church suggesting that it's your dealing with the poor that will merit your salvation.
[time=1261] On the authority of Scripture we are suggesting that God indicts His people then and now if they do not treat the poor in ways that please Him and they reflect His heart.
[time=1272] We are suggesting that.
[time=1274] A couple of quotes to share with you.
[time=1276] I shared with you months ago but I don't think it took.
[time=1279] So I'm going to share them again.
[time=1281] Maybe this time.
[time=1285] Richard Stearns is the president of world vision.
[time=1290] He said this on the greatest need facing the world today.
[time=1294] In today's world, racked by terrorism, poverty, lawlessness, disease and violence,
[time=1301] the message of the gospel and the need for Christians who put their faith into action has never been more acute.
[time=1308] We the followers of Jesus Christ are an integral.
[time=1311] A key part of God's plan for the world.
[time=1314] The same world that God loved so much that He gave His one and only Son.
[time=1322] That whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life.
[time=1325] In this famous verse we see the depth of God's love for our world.
[time=1328] It was not a passive and sentimental love but rather a dynamic, active, sacrificial love for God's soul of the world that He acted.
[time=1339] And in conclusion, this is from Christianity Today magazine about three years ago.
[time=1346] And this I think is the crux.
[time=1348] This is the key.
[time=1350] None of these good works, HIV/AIDS research, relief of hunger, poverty or eliminating malaria or tuberculosis.
[time=1359] Nay, great works deal with the most profound social problem facing humankind.
[time=1367] That social problem is alienation from God.
[time=1371] We must be clear that dear friends, if we say to a person that has no shirt,
[time=1378] here's a shirt and walk away and don't give them Jesus, that's not okay.
[time=1385] Someone who has no shirt, we don't walk up to them and say, here's, I'm going to give you Jesus and good luck finding a shirt.
[time=1392] That's not okay either.
[time=1394] They're not mutually exclusive and that's the full counsel of God, my friends.
[time=1400] That's Isaiah 58 like a laser beam right at you.
[time=1404] I pray that you will lean in today for what you're about to see.
[time=1408] I pray that you would have open ears.
[time=1411] I pray that you would have ears to hear as the prophet said.
[time=1416] I pray that you would have eyes to see and that God would show you wonderful things from his word about how it is that we might respond as a people to this great offer of salvation and this great truth of good news that God has come in the person of Jesus.
[time=1432] And because he has come, we ought to live in a certain way.
[time=1436] Would you watch and engage this morning and let your heart be open to what God would say?
[time=1466] [MUSIC]
[time=1480] Deep in the jungles of Southern India, the Mudwa tribe live in the trees to avoid being trampled by wild elephants.
[time=1489] Whilst the setting looks simply a dealic, with lack of food or clean water, no medical care, deadly flying snakes and poisonous spiders, this tribe is struggling to survive.
[time=1501] [MUSIC - 52 seconds]
[time=1576] With no money or education, many people who moved to the cities from places like the jungle in India resort to borrowing money in order to survive.
[time=1586] In doing this, they often end up in quarries, brick factories or sweatshops, trapped into bonded labor systems.
[time=1594] [MUSIC - 29 seconds]
[time=1633] The quarry worker comes to the quarry and he takes a big loan from the quarry owner.
[time=1641] What he's paid is a meager amount.
[time=1644] It is just 30 to 40 cents per day, and that will be very difficult for him to clear the loan.
[time=1652] Initially, they don't realize that it's a trap.
[time=1656] [MUSIC - 13 seconds]
[time=1681] They will never be able to live without being in debt.
[time=1684] [MUSIC]
[time=1691] Bonded labor is one of the most shocking outcomes of poverty.
[time=1695] It enslaves people like Sanjeev and Shivama and their families.
[time=1699] Their total debt amounts to only about $600, but they will never be able to pay it back.
[time=1706] It'll be passed on to their children and their children's children.
[time=1710] There's simply no escape.
[time=1712] [MUSIC - 37 seconds]
[time=1756] Working the quarry starts early.
[time=1758] [MUSIC - 45 seconds]
[time=1807] Sanjeev and his family work in the blazing heat, cutting, breaking and collecting the granite rocks.
[time=1814] It's back-breaking work that can often result in injury.
[time=1817] [MUSIC - 41 seconds]
[time=1864] These quarry workers have been injured.
[time=1867] And finally, they are into a lot of problems.
[time=1870] So, if he falls, again, he has to take another loan from the quarry owner.
[time=1876] And again, the debt also gets raised day by day.
[time=1880] If he is not able to work in the quarry because of his old age or hill health or injury,
[time=1886] the quarry owners will not leave them.
[time=1889] Their wife or daughter or son will be caught into this.
[time=1893] [MUSIC - 164 seconds]
[time=2071] This is something that we've seen all over the world.
[time=2074] When children get around 12 years old, their childlike energy and innocence disappears.
[time=2080] Every father will have a dream about their own children.
[time=2084] But unfortunately, all those dreams are built in the sky.
[time=2088] In the cloud, it is not a reality.
[time=2091] That is the hard cry of our quarry worker.
[time=2096] When I say that I'm a follower of Jesus Christ, when I see these sort of misery happening here, I can't be indifferent to it.
[time=2104] In the Bible, Jesus said a parable called as parable of a good Samaritan, where a man was wounded and he was lying on the roadside.
[time=2113] I view this quarry worker as something like that man, lying down, tying without any help.
[time=2121] And as a Christian, I would like to be a good Samaritan to them.
[time=2126] And the church has to be a good Samaritan to them.
[time=2130] [MUSIC]
[time=2149] Let's look at this.
[time=2150] What a spectacular place this is.
[time=2152] This is the exact location that Jesus had in his mind.
[time=2156] When he told the story of the good Samaritan recorded in Luke chapter 10, I mean, he knew when he said there was a man on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho that everyone would conjure up this stark sort of terrifying desolate place.
[time=2173] To be compassionate, to be that kind of Samaritan, it takes some risk.
[time=2177] It takes courage to be a compassionate.
[time=2180] This man didn't know as he stopped to help the smoonded man that the thieves weren't working ready to pounce on him as well.
[time=2187] To be compassionate in a hurting world means it's going to cost something.
[time=2191] It cost this good Samaritan time.
[time=2193] He interrupted his whole journey.
[time=2195] It cost him money.
[time=2197] He said, and Jesus even told exactly how much money, two silver coins.
[time=2201] He said, "You take care of it.
[time=2203] Maybe this will help, but I'll pay the rest of it when I come." And probably most important, it cost him a big chunk of his heart because he had to enter into this man's ugly trauma.
[time=2212] He had to get his hands bloody.
[time=2214] He had to risk rejection.
[time=2215] It cost him a big piece of his own heart.
[time=2218] That is our Lord.
[time=2220] And he ends the story with those incredibly powerful words, "Go and do the same thing." Back in the quarry, the local church are doing what they can to alleviate the extreme poverty among the workers and their families.
[time=2236] This includes supporting women and mothers, a particularly vulnerable group.
[time=2241] We teach them some of the income generation skills.
[time=2245] Immunization.
[time=2246] Tundlin is hygien.
[time=2248] And we also say that our mother should be taught how to take care of the babies.
[time=2254] And most important thing, we say that you're not alone.
[time=2258] Number one, God is with you.
[time=2260] And as a community of God's children, we are with you.
[time=2263] Now they are very happy and they say that, "Yes, it is worth living with Jesus Christ."
[time=2270] And slowly one by one, they started coming to the Lord.
[time=2274] Samuel and his team have also set up a project for children
[time=2286] to look after basic needs like health care, education and nutrition.
[time=2291] For many quarry workers trapped in bonded labour, this brings enormous hope.
[time=2300] We are very happy to see them.
