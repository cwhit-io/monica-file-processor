[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Hey, I'm here in Mr. Guthrie's first grade classroom here at Black Caught Christian at our school.
[time=37] And I've actually been in this classroom a number of times.
[time=41] I think every one of our five kids may have had Mr. Guthrie.
[time=45] And I've been in and out of this room more times than I can remember.
[time=48] And every time I walk in this room screams one thing, it screams kids.
[time=52] It screams little kids from the Play-Doh to the colored pencils and pink erasers and Clifford books and posters.
[time=63] It's all about being little.
[time=66] And we're getting ready to start a series at Black Caught on Sunday mornings.
[time=71] Couple of weeks, October 7 and 14, and we're gonna entitle it, grow or die.
[time=78] Because you're doing one or the other spiritually, especially, you're growing or you're dying.
[time=84] You're either moving forward, deepening your faith and understanding, growing in character and integrity, or you're not.
[time=93] And the thing is, not isn't neutral.
[time=96] Not is dying.
[time=99] If you're not growing, you're fading.
[time=104] If you're not growing, you're heading in a very dangerous direction.
[time=108] And we don't want that for you.
[time=110] First Corinthians three and Hebrews five.
[time=112] This is where we'll be studying in this new series.
[time=115] And in those passages, it talks about how God designed us to move forward from milk to meat.
[time=123] In those passages, it talks about how some early on should be taught, but then as time goes by, they should become teachers.
[time=130] See, the scriptures are just filled with this picture of growth.
[time=134] And we want that for you.
[time=136] We want you to grow and we wanna help you grow.
[time=138] We can't play with Play-Doh forever.
[time=142] We've gotta grow up and face the things that life brings and we gotta face them in a way that allows us to exercise maturity and so come and be with us.
[time=153] As together, we do our very best to grow and not die.

[time=331] (audience applauds) - Wow.
[time=345] My goodness.
[time=347] Just clap again while I try to figure out exactly what to say.
[time=353] I, maybe I'll just,
[time=359] maybe I'll just read this.
[time=361] I'm so grateful for all the families and all the work Corbin and the team did to put this together here.
[time=369] This powerful picture of our God's great love, amen?
[time=374] Says in the NIV in Romans 9, 25, as he, God, says in Hosea.
[time=388] I will call them my people who are not my people.
[time=392] And I will call her my loved one who is not my loved one.
[time=398] And in the very place where it was said to them, "You are not my people.
[time=404] "They will be called children of the living God." And what a joy for us today to celebrate not only the redeeming love of God, that every person in this room who knows him, everybody here who has ever fully surrendered your heart and life to his son.
[time=427] You know that redeeming love that made you his own.
[time=431] And we celebrate that.
[time=432] We also celebrate these families who had it in their hearts to extend themselves and their homes and their futures to give love and the longing
[time=445] and grace and protection and direction they've given so much to these little ones who needed it.
[time=455] And some have given it for years and some have given it for months.
[time=461] And we get the blessing as a family to be a part of that great endeavor, amen?
[time=466] So clap for God and his great redeeming love.
[time=469] (audience applauds) Let me ask the greeters if they would come forward and what a great time to just give of our tithes and our offerings this morning.
[time=482] Would you bow and pray with me?
[time=485] Oh, Father God in heaven, of a Father, the scriptures say, "Dad, this picture of a loving gracious heavenly father who extends himself and wraps his arms around us
[time=501] who pulls us up out of the myery clay who rescues us from our sin and iniquity who gives us a home in the midst of our lostness, gives us hope and meaning, forgiveness." Oh, Father, we celebrate you this morning and we're grateful for all that you have passed along to us.
[time=521] And as we as a family and as these families standing on the stage here today as they continue to try with your help, to pass along your goodness and your grace, your truth and your kindness, God, please build them up.
[time=534] Give them a sweet sense of your spirit and your presence and may their little ones experience the same love
[time=544] and kindness and grace, God, that we have experienced with you.
[time=549] Of people who weren't your people who now have the privilege of being called the children of God.
[time=557] We thank you for that this morning.
[time=559] We give out of hearts that are grateful for that in your son's name we pray.
[time=563] And everybody agreed and said, amen.
[time=565] (gentle music) - Well, welcome back again.
[time=580] So many of you here in the room I know have been a part of these last several weeks as we have engaged in a study of the great chapter in Isaiah chapter 58, giving us God's heart and God's mind, the direction, the bent of God's heart for those in need.
[time=596] Along with this chapter, we've been able to view and watch clips from a motion picture released last year entitled Live 58, actually put out by live58.org, an organization partnering with other ministries to try and help the church, you and me, understand better and see more clearly the need that exists in our world today and the opportunity God gives the church to respond in real and meaningful ways.
[time=625] Last week's clip took us to places
[time=631] where we're at not for the hope of the gospel and the life-giving service of the local church.
[time=637] I think we all would have just curled up in a ball of despair and died.
[time=642] It was hard, it was difficult.
[time=644] And yet hope-giving at the same time.
[time=647] If you missed it, you can see it online.
[time=650] At our website, you can go to live58.org and watch the whole thing.
[time=654] But I hope you'll go back and see it if you missed it.
[time=656] Got some responses here from some who were with us in the service last week with what we saw going on in India with the young gals in the slave trade industry.
[time=668] With that story being played out, one gentleman wrote my response, Pastor Kelly is intense rage.
[time=675] Rage against the enemy and a renewed commitment to in the name of Jesus Christ, wage all out war against him and his schemes of darkness.
[time=686] God didn't give him the inherent heart of a warrior to waste it on playing silly kid games.
[time=692] He gave us a warrior's spirit for war against the evil plots of the enemy.
[time=696] To boldly go to the front lines and to harm's way if needed and rescue orphans and free the daughters trapped in slavery.
[time=704] Rise up, oh men of God, this is what we were made for.
[time=709] If that was my daughter, he wrote, I'd claw through a brick wall to savor.
[time=717] And yet now I can hear some saying, but that's not my daughter.
[time=721] And he writes, but my response is I hear God saying that it's mine and if you love him, I will rescue her.
[time=731] Rise up, oh men of God, this is what we were made for.
[time=734] And then with, I believe, Sanjeev, in mind,
[time=740] our friend at the rock quarry.
[time=742] Another gentleman from our church wrote in, since Sunday, Kelly, when I heard the dad, a dad like you and I in the Indian rock quarry indicate that the $600 debt he couldn't repay was going to keep both him and his children enslaved for the rest of their lives, a phrase from a song that I heard sung by my mom, family and church, from my earliest childhood, has continued to ring through my head.
[time=769] The song says he paid a debt, he did not owe.
[time=772] I owed a debt, I could not what?
[time=774] Pay.
[time=777] I also can't get out of my head.
[time=778] The question I expressed to you, Kelly, after the service says there've been an avenue created to channel $600 in order to buy that family's freedom.
[time=787] The heart of the gospel can hardly be expressed in a more simple way, and I am hard pressed to come up with a more direct correlation of doing something for the least of these that so clearly connects with the gospel message.
[time=800] He writes, I'm so blessed to have experienced something so different as a child having lived in a place that placed a song deep in my heart that 40 years later is stirred.
[time=812] When hearing the story of other children who won't even allow themselves to dream, because there is no hope of ever having anything different.
[time=821] And so I asked Corbin if he wouldn't mind tracking that song down, he did.
[time=829] And I just wanted to have you sit quietly and have Corbin play and just sing a bit from this great song that talks about the one who paid a debt that you nor I could have ever paid.
[time=845] He paid a debt I did not owe.
[time=851] I owed a debt I could not pay.
[time=856] I needed someone to wash my sins away.
[time=866] And now I sing a brand new song amazing grace.
[time=877] Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay.
[time=887] He paid a debt he did not owe.
[time=893] I owed a debt I could not pay.
[time=898] I needed someone to wash my sins away.
[time=907] And now I sing a brand new song amazing grace.
[time=917] Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay.
[time=927] A tragic but hopeful sequence of events regarding Sanjeev.
[time=944] I think maybe they'll have his picture on the screen.
[time=947] We learned recently that even after moving to another quarry where he continued to try and deal with this debt through circumstances that no one's being real clear about.
[time=960] It wasn't film related, but the report we get
[time=966] is that Sanjeev over some dispute was executed, was killed.
[time=972] And in the midst of that tragedy we now learn that live 58
[time=979] and really the local church that we saw in action there in the film last week has come in and taken over care and custody of his wife and five kids.
[time=990] And so freedom was granted in a way
[time=997] that none of us would have ever expected.
[time=999] And yet the need still continues.
[time=1002] And we still continue to look into ways that we as a family possibly could even help in the days to come.
[time=1009] Would you stand and let me read to you this morning as we begin James?
[time=1013] James 127 says pure and undefiled religion,
[time=1021] pure and undefiled religion.
[time=1025] And the side of our God and Father is this, to visit who church, say it, and who?
[time=1033] In their what?
[time=1035] To visit orphans and widows in their distress is pure and undefiled religion.
[time=1042] And then there is this great phrase at the end of that verse that in some ways almost like makes you go, wait, why did he put that in there?
[time=1050] But then when you think about it, you begin to understand why he puts it in there.
[time=1055] And to keep oneself unstained by the what?
[time=1059] Say it, the world.
[time=1062] What does the world have to do with the level of or the lack of compassion?
[time=1070] Think about it.
[time=1071] I don't think you probably have to think about that long.
[time=1075] To begin to understand why it is he would put that in there for you and I to be careful with how stained we get by the world when it comes to then caring about that which means the most to God.
[time=1091] The promise in pursuit, I found this this week.
[time=1094] The promise in pursuit of pleasure can oftentimes be compassion's greatest enemy.
[time=1099] There you have it.
[time=1100] Gluttons, hedonists, and the easily entertained
[time=1106] make lousy helpers.
[time=1109] Let's pray.
[time=1112] - Our Father in Heaven, we come before you this morning, hopeful again for a fresh sense and fresh touch of your spirit and also an experience God this morning with your life giving word.
[time=1124] May the things that we see in Isaiah 58, may the things that we see played out in the concluding segments of our film this morning.
[time=1132] God may all that we experience in this time together, point us toward you and your heart and your mind for those in need.
[time=1139] God those in physical need and those in spiritual need.
[time=1144] May we be ready, God, as a family, with a blanket or the gospel.
[time=1151] May we be ready, God, as a family, as individuals with kindness and generosity with a gift.
[time=1160] And may we be ready to pass along life giving truth as well.
[time=1164] God grow us this morning, we pray in your Son's name.
[time=1167] [AMEN] You can have a seat and as you sit down, would you please open up quickly a lot to look at this morning.
[time=1173] Isaiah 58, I wanna take you back to, I want you to see something today.
[time=1178] If you believe God's word to be true, I wanna show you something this morning that is profoundly important and I think very exciting.
[time=1187] And I wanna start at verse six, verses six and seven.
[time=1190] The first five verses God has gone to great lengths in a succinct way, five verses, to show the people of Israel, to show the people of God how they had drifted from what he designed, how they had moved away from his heart for those in need.
[time=1205] Their fasting or their spiritual activity had become meaningless because it had been lost in formalism and externalism, a going through the motions without it really meaning anything.
[time=1220] And he could tell it didn't mean anything because it lacked their spiritual activity.
[time=1226] It lacked that which he had designed from the very beginning, which was a love for and a sensitivity to and a care for others.
[time=1236] And he says, no, no, no, you're way, way off base.
[time=1239] Is this not the fast which I choose?
[time=1242] To loosen the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke and to let the oppressed go free and break every yoke or a good word there you could put in his burden.
[time=1252] Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into the house when you see the naked to cover him and to not turn your head, to not hide yourself from your own flesh?
[time=1268] And here's what I want you to see, the wording and the verbiage of six and seven, if you'll do this, if you'll do this, if you'll do that, then comes eight, then.
[time=1280] Then your light will break out like the dawn, your recovery will speedily spring forth, your righteousness will go before you, then the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard again.
[time=1291] Then you will call and the Lord will answer.
[time=1295] You will cry and he will say, here I am.
[time=1297] Back at the beginning of 58, they're crying for him and he's not even around.
[time=1301] All of a sudden he says, here I am, if you remove the yoke from your midst, the pointing of the finger and the speaking wickedness and if you give yourself to the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then your light will rise in darkness and your gloom will become like midday, then the Lord will continually guide you and satisfy your desire in scorched places and give strength to your bones and you will be like a water garden, like a spring of water whose waters do not fail, those from among you will rebuild the ancient ruins, you will raise up the age old foundations, you will be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of the streets in which to dwell.
[time=1349] This morning we find in the text of Isaiah 58, this thing that God does at times, this approach when he says, hey listen, hey listen people of God if you'll do this thing,
[time=1366] I'll do these things.
[time=1369] You choose that and I'll bless you with this.
[time=1374] Get this straightened out and I'll take care of you big time.
[time=1379] And as I've learned over the years, there's an interesting dynamic that can start to occur with the people of God as it relates to these kinds of promises from God, people start thinking, so this is how God operates.
[time=1393] I make some good choices, I do some good things, I keep myself in line and boom, God pours out his favor on me, that's sort of what it looks like, huh?
[time=1404] Bear with me for a minute, I wanna make a really important observation here, that to some in the room may seem to just be semantics, but I would offer to you this morning that it's not semantics, it's really important that you understand this.
[time=1421] I want you to look, turn to Isaiah one, go ahead in your Bibles, open 'em up there, I want you to go back to Isaiah one, and here's what I want you to do this morning, church, as we study the word, as we look through this, especially this passage, the next couple of passages, ask yourself this question, what's connected to the promises of God?
[time=1442] We clearly have some promises from God here in Isaiah 58.
[time=1447] As you turn to Isaiah one, as we go on to Psalm 34, you're going to see promise after promise after promise, you're gonna start to see this picture of favor and blessing and goodness, but I want you to ask yourself as you read through this, what are the promises connected to?
[time=1463] Isaiah one, 15, so when you spread out, God's not happy with Israel again.
[time=1470] So when you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you, sound familiar?
[time=1477] Yes, even though you multiply prayers, I will not listen, your hands are covered with blood, wash yourselves, make yourselves clean, remove the evil of your deeds from my sight, cease to do evil, learn to do good,
[time=1496] seek what, church, say it, reprove the roofless, defend the who, say it, plead for the widow, come now and let us reason together, says the Lord, though your sins are as scarlet, they will be as white as snow, though they are like crimson, though they are red like crimson, they will be like wool, if you consent and obey, you will eat the best of the land, but if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword, truly, the mouth of the Lord has spoken, if you consent and obey, you will eat, but if you refuse and rebel, you will die.
[time=1543] God's blessing, his divine favor certainly being offered, if they'll do what, when what takes place, what's connected to the promises of God?
[time=1556] Go to Psalm 34, please church, turn in your Bibles, read along with me if you would, Psalm 3411.
[time=1566] Psalm 3411, come, he says, come you children, listen to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
[time=1574] Who here comes from blessing?
[time=1576] Who is the man who desires life and loves length of days that he may see good, keep your tongue from evil?
[time=1584] It says, keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit depart from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it, the eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous and his ears are open to their cry, the face of the Lord is against evil doers, to cut off the memory of them from the earth, the righteous cry and the Lord hears and delivers them out of all their troubles, the Lord is near to the broken hearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
[time=1620] Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all, he keeps all his bones, not one of them is broken, evil shall slay the wicked and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.
[time=1634] The Lord redeems the soul of his servants and none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.
[time=1641] Let me say it to you this way this morning, the promises of God, my friends and scripture, promises to bless and honor and show favor and protect and lift up and reward at times in scripture aren't so much tied to you doing what you're supposed to do.
[time=1661] No, the promises of God and specifically the promises found in Isaiah 58 are all rooted in and connected to your readiness to stop doing what's wrong.
[time=1674] To stop doing the things that God has commanded us, not to in other words, these amazing promises of Isaiah 58, eight through 12 that I read to you this morning can and will come to pass only when the people of God confess, repent and move away from their sin, sinful arrogance as it relates to those in need, sinful selfishness, sinful pride, sinful isolation from reality, turning your back.
[time=1706] Are you living rightly today?
[time=1711] Are you living righteously?
[time=1713] If you are, I'm glad you should.
[time=1716] You should live that way and you may get some blessings and you may face some heartache.
[time=1720] But if you're following the Lord, honoring God as a pattern in your life with your heart aligned with the things his heart is aligned toward, you're in a great place already blessed, lots of favor.
[time=1733] These promises in Isaiah 58, eight to 12 this morning, what did it say, the glory of the Lord coming back to protect you, his presence again coming close to you, your light that was almost out, rising up out of darkness, your gloom becoming as bright as midday, these promises are for those in sin.
[time=1760] These promises are for those who do not live today
[time=1768] with hearts aligned with that which God's heart is aligned toward.
[time=1773] God's word reminds us today church that there's not a worse place you could ever be than in sin than to have a heart that is hard towards that which softens God's heart,
[time=1793] not a worse place you could ever be than in sin.
[time=1799] As it relates to God's design for the way he wants you to view and approach the opportunities he's given you with those in need, spiritual and physical.
[time=1812] You cry out and he seems distant, you're weak without his strength, you wander without his guidance, you're in gloom, darkness and depression without his presence and make no mistake this morning.
[time=1824] He says to you, "If you'll do this, I'll do that and be clear today that this is confess and repent
[time=1836] to confess and repent of any and all sins
[time=1843] specifically here in Isaiah 58, the sin of not extending kindness and hope, the sin of not reaching out to the poor, the unjustly imprisoned, the hungry, the homeless, the needy that's all from the text, the needy, the physically needy and those who spiritually need you." And God says there's just too much looking the other way.
[time=1870] I want to show you some phrases this morning
[time=1876] as we work our way into viewing the last segment of the film, I want to spend a little bit more time here in the text, go back to Isaiah 58, let me take you to verse nine, some phrases I want you to look closely at.
[time=1888] As you consider how it is that God is asking you to respond, what does confession and repentance for you look like?
[time=1896] What does it look like for us as a family?
[time=1900] I want you to look at a phrase in verse nine, it says there in the middle of verse nine, if you remove the yoke from your midst, you see that, if you remove the burden from your midst, the pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness,
[time=1919] removing the yoke from your midst.
[time=1922] Church, I want you to consider this this morning, if you confess and repent of the yoke, the burden of oppression that you've allowed in your midst.
[time=1933] When you study this and you think about the people of Israel, when you look into it as I did this week and try to understand what this would have meant and how this would have played out with the people of Israel, it's really pretty clear in Old Testament Israel, what Isaiah is saying, what God is saying to the people of Israel through Isaiah is that as the people of Israel are moving around, they are allowing in or near them, in or around them, there is this willingness to allow burden to exist, burden that they could lift, burden that they could address, burden that they could do something about.
[time=1970] And so it is this really clear, really practical in the sense challenge for you and I today in the New Testament age, we're not Israel, we're not the Old Testament community, but we are the church and for us, it's the church, it's the church here in Fort Wayne, it's the church in Nairobi, it's the church in India, in and around the church.
[time=1993] Isaiah 58 reminds us this morning, we can't allow, we can't allow the yoke, we can't allow the burdens that at times exist in our midst to go unaddressed.
[time=2005] We don't have to do nor can we do everything, but you can do what?
[time=2010] Say something, you can do something.
[time=2015] And I wanna just encourage you this morning while we will collectively as a family Lord willing and we're hopeful and praying and you're gonna hear more about it at the end of day, we're hopeful for an enormous opportunity for us to collectively do something about the burden and the yoke.
[time=2031] I want you to understand that while we're thinking about doing something collectively, I just care so deeply that you would do something in your own life, like today, tomorrow, this week,
[time=2045] that you would be willing to think about this and become more generous, that you would be willing to think about this and look for any and every opportunity God may bring across your path.
[time=2056] Somebody under a yoke, you understand a yoke, it's the stuff they would put over the ox and it's the stuff they would put over the cattle, it's the leather straps and the stuff in their mouths and the whips and it was heavy and it was hard.
[time=2068] And so I'm wondering if this morning you would really truly be willing to with this truth in mind, think about even the remaining hours of this day.
[time=2077] And would you ask God to give you the presence of mind and the strength of heart to be somebody that actually lifts a burden?
[time=2087] Maybe you know right now who it is, maybe you would just ask God to make you aware of one that he may bring across your path, but while I'm excited about the big picture of where this may go, I know it'll falter the big picture if individually we're not becoming more gracious and generous and kind and thoughtful.
[time=2106] Would you pray?
[time=2108] Would you in your heart and mind pray right now, God, give me a soft heart to lift a burden?
[time=2114] Give me eyes to see today, God, a burden.
[time=2118] Give me sensitivity to somebody who's hurting.
[time=2121] Give me an awareness of someone whose need I could meet.
[time=2126] And I promise you if you pray that prayer today, I promise you God will give you an opportunity to live out the very truth.
[time=2134] He doesn't want there to be a yoke in our midst.
[time=2138] We, as is people, calls us to do something about it.
[time=2140] Look at verse 10, some more phrases I want you to consider this morning, some things I want you to see in the text.
[time=2146] Two phrases out of verse 10.
[time=2148] And if you give yourself to the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted,
[time=2159] there's your two phrases.
[time=2161] What's the promise?
[time=2162] Then your light will rise in darkness and your gloom will become like midday.
[time=2170] Look at that first phrase.
[time=2172] And if you give yourself to the hungry, you know, there's a lot of us in the room that upon further review, wish he would have written that a little differently.
[time=2184] But it says what it says.
[time=2189] As you study this phrase and look into its deepest meaning, you find that scripture here calls you and me to a response much deeper than the toss of a coin into a can.
[time=2204] Because if God's intent here in this phrase was to get dimes and nickels and cans, he would have said if you give change.
[time=2214] But it doesn't say if you give change, does it?
[time=2221] Does it?
[time=2225] No.
[time=2227] God doesn't say give change.
[time=2229] God says give who?
[time=2230] Give you.
[time=2232] And I just want you to think about that for a moment.
[time=2235] He says give you.
[time=2237] Here's hunger.
[time=2238] Here's need.
[time=2239] And he says give you.
[time=2243] Give yourself.
[time=2247] This isn't just an act.
[time=2252] He's suggesting here in the text that there's something very deep going on.
[time=2258] Or there should be.
[time=2260] Something very deep happening in you when you and I come across need and it's so deep and it's so real and it's so impacts us that we give a dime, a buck.
[time=2275] No, no, he says give you.
[time=2278] You say what does that mean?
[time=2283] I don't know what it necessarily means for you.
[time=2288] But I know this, if you say the same prayer I just asked you to pray about lifting burdens.
[time=2294] If you were to pray today, oh God give me understanding how do I give myself to need that I come across?
[time=2301] How do I honor you God and not throw a nickel but how do I somehow give my heart wisely and appropriately but meaningfully?
[time=2315] You know what he's really saying here and I know this is pretty simple but I think it's a pretty important concept to at least wrestle with briefly.
[time=2326] What he's really saying here is that he wants you to care.
[time=2330] And the truth is a lot of us don't.
[time=2334] Really, truly, deeply.
[time=2340] Care.
[time=2341] And sometimes these are opportunities for us to look in the mirror and stand before God and in the honesty and sincerity of our hearts.
[time=2350] Say, oh God, I should care a lot more.
[time=2353] It feels like I should care more.
[time=2355] I don't.
[time=2356] I feel dead to this.
[time=2358] Stuff doesn't stir me.
[time=2359] I'm not really moved by it.
[time=2362] I got things to do in places to go.
[time=2367] And as cold or as harsh as that may sound, if that's honest, then be honest and give God the opportunity to begin to revive a cold and distant heart and move you again or maybe for the first time toward a response that would truly be in line with his heart.
[time=2387] God's people care about those in need.
[time=2390] What breaks the heart of God is when the people of God don't.
[time=2393] When your heart really isn't stirred in the face of physical and/or spiritual need, then God says, Isaiah 58 1, Isaiah declared to my people their transgression and to the house of Jacob, their sin.
[time=2408] So I would invite you this week.
[time=2412] I would invite you this week to do something to sacrifice time.
[time=2417] Think about it.
[time=2418] Time, talent, treasure, yours.
[time=2420] To think about giving up to some degree your time, talent, or treasure.
[time=2427] To give up part of you this week.
[time=2429] 10 minutes, an hour, redeeming Christmas.
[time=2433] Corbin's gonna come and talk to you about it here in a moment.
[time=2436] How can you and I as a family?
[time=2438] Give ourselves.
[time=2440] And when we give ourselves, if you will, the text says, you satisfy the desire of the afflicted.
[time=2446] There's the second phrase I want you to see.
[time=2448] Verse 10, you satisfy the desire of the afflicted.
[time=2451] Church, question for you this morning.
[time=2453] What is the deepest, most important desire of the afflicted?
[time=2458] I'm asking you, think about it.
[time=2461] What do hungry, thirsty, sick, impoverished, hopeless, people need and want from you?
[time=2467] I don't know what comes to your mind.
[time=2472] I'll tell you, I've been to Kibera.
[time=2474] And I don't say this proudly, I say it, thankfully.
[time=2478] I've gotten to be in Kibera and the Mothari Valley.
[time=2481] I've walked in these places that you see on the screen.
[time=2483] I've held and played with abandoned toddlers at our orphanage at New Life.
[time=2488] I've played soccer with those little guys on that dirt rock field.
[time=2493] I've sat in leaking aluminum churches.
[time=2497] I've walked into those cardboard huts.
[time=2500] I've smelled and seen the raw sewage flowing past the front door.
[time=2504] I've held the hungry, heartbroken mother in my arms who can no longer find the strength to dig through garbage for something to feed her children.
[time=2512] I've seen the darkest despair and hopelessness I ever could have imagined.
[time=2517] And it felt like I saw it in HD.
[time=2519] And guess what I noticed?
[time=2524] Guess what I realized?
[time=2525] Each and every time, I would ever have the chance.
[time=2527] And God would orchestrate these opportunities where I would get to be with and sit with and talk with and guess what would happen?
[time=2534] Eight out of 10 times.
[time=2536] When I'd sit with these eight-year-olds or these 30-year-olds or these 70-year-olds, no kidding, within five minutes, they'd be holding my hand.
[time=2543] We'd be holding hands.
[time=2548] And if I walked, they would walk with me.
[time=2550] And they'd hold onto my hand.
[time=2554] Kids held onto my hand.
[time=2555] Moms and dads held onto my hand.
[time=2557] They wanted hugs.
[time=2560] And I learned that they would let go of my five bucks before they'd let go of me because afflicted people desire love and kindness.
[time=2570] This is how they are reached.
[time=2573] This is how they are cared for.
[time=2575] This is the heart of God toward those in need.
[time=2578] That's why I believe Paul said, "Look at the screen if you would." In 1 Thessalonians, as he talks about his first entrance into Thessalonica, people think this might be his approach to pastoring while it might be, but I'll tell you what before he ever pastored these people, he reached them.
[time=2594] And this is how he reached them.
[time=2597] This is how he came up to people who were in spiritual need.
[time=2600] This is Isaiah 58 stuff, getting lived out in the life of Paul.
[time=2604] For we never came, this is back when he first shows up.
[time=2607] We never came with externalism, with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed.
[time=2614] God is witness, we weren't about formalism.
[time=2618] For we never came, so keep going.
[time=2620] Verse six, and he goes on and says, "Nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others.
[time=2625] It wasn't about externals.
[time=2627] Even though it was apostles of Christ, we might have asserted our authority." He goes on in verse seven and says this, "But we prove to be gentle among you." He says, gentle as a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children.
[time=2644] And in verse eight, having so fond an affection for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God.
[time=2652] There's the spiritual need starting to be met, but also our own lives.
[time=2657] There's the physical efforts because you had become very dear to us.
[time=2664] The kindness and the generosity and the sincerity, a willingness to satisfy the desire of the afflicted
[time=2674] as we give ourselves.
[time=2676] Friends, watch if you would these next few minutes be encouraged as we see this great saga begin to unfold right before us and come to a conclusion.
[time=2686] Keep your hearts and your minds open.
[time=2688] Corbin and I'll be back in just a few moments to wrap up our time together.
[time=2692] There are many ways to get involved in tackling issues of poverty and injustice.
[time=2698] We've come to the US state of Georgia where a coffee shop is modeling a fresh way of doing business.
[time=2705] Wake up coffee is committed to giving some of its profits to charity.
[time=2711] It sells fair trade products, guaranteeing a fair weight for producers and artisans overseas.
[time=2718] It's even become an advocate in the area for issues of poverty and depression.
[time=2722] One of the biggest impacts we have on fighting poverty
[time=2728] is we're a fair trade shop.
[time=2729] We definitely believe in the principles behind fair trade.
[time=2732] We believe in alleviating child slavery.
[time=2735] We believe in using environmentally sustainable practices and all the products that we sell.
[time=2741] Another way is we give a portion of our profits every month.
[time=2744] This is a new company we're not able to give as much money as we would prefer.
[time=2748] But what we are able to do is we're able to be a hub for a lot of organizations that are trying to fight things globally.
[time=2754] One of the biggest things that we as believers can do to fight poverty is first of all, I think we can educate ourselves and to be aware, it just broadens our perspective.
[time=2766] It lets us understand what God's doing globally.
[time=2768] And when we do that, we realize that the way that we live here in a Western culture is very, very, very different in the way the rest of the world functions.
[time=2777] And so for us, there's no greater opportunity than to model something different and something unique.
[time=2782] You know, the Bible does say that they'll know us by the way we live our lives and the way we treat one another.
[time=2786] And so if we're living this counter-cultural life, what a great opportunity for people to notice something that's totally different about us.
[time=2793] With entrepreneurs like Beaumann actively getting involved in issues of justice, fasting some of their profits and strategically linking with people in poor communities, change is taking place.
[time=2805] We used to say that 40,000 children die every day
[time=2812] from hunger and preventable diseases.
[time=2814] And now we're at 21,000 per day.
[time=2816] We've cut in half the number of children who are dying of preventable causes before their fifth birthday.
[time=2823] And one of the reasons for that progress is that these kids now have access to clean drinking water.
[time=2830] Did you know that just since 1990, 600 million people have gained access to safe drinking water?
[time=2838] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2852] Another major killer of children around the world is malaria.
[time=2856] In six years between 2002 and 2008, in that six year span, 22 countries have cut their malaria rate in half.
[time=2866] And they did it through simple interventions.
[time=2868] They did it through insecticide treated nets and better medicines and spraying to kill mosquitoes, things that can be done and are being done.
[time=2875] In my first bone, I had difficulty with malaria.
[time=2879] They gave me two pair of nets.
[time=2882] I was very happy, very happy because I would use one for the kids, the other one for mine.
[time=2889] And I thank God, even the total to trip that net.
[time=2893] - We are making incredible progress, but if you're only gonna remember one thing from all this stuff that I'm telling you, please remember this.
[time=2901] In the span of a generation, we have cut in half the percentage of people living in extreme economic poverty.
[time=2908] The question is, what's it gonna take to get to zero?
[time=2911] World renowned economists have said that $73 billion per year over a span of 10 years is what it will take to end extreme poverty.
[time=2920] And now that might seem like a lot of money, but when you compare it to the $2.5 trillion that God has given, just North American Christians, I'm not talking about all the Christians around the world, talking about those of us who attend church regularly and say our faith is very important to us here in the United States.
[time=2938] $2.5 trillion compared to that $73 billion is nothing.
[time=2942] We have been given everything we need.
[time=2945] God has given us everything we need to end extreme poverty.
[time=2948] - It's amazing to think that our resources can make such a difference to the poor, but money isn't the only answer.
[time=2956] The church has a powerful voice which we can use to bring about change.
[time=2960] In Ethiopia, the church has lobbied solidly for environmental causes to protect the landscape and hopes for the future.
[time=2969] No, it has brought government and religious groups together to plant trees and set aside green spaces.
[time=2976] - Where we are standing now is a good example
[time=2984] of what happens when the church partners and cooperates with local governments.
[time=2992] Things like this, I mean, planting trees, water supply, caring for needy children and elderly, the church taking the lead and then the government coming and working and cooperating with the church.
[time=3008] The thing we have seen here can be replicated
[time=3015] all over the world and the church can actually play its role as indicated Isaiah 58 repairing the broken walls, whether it is a broken wall of the environment, broken wall of relationship and then broken walls of production, the church can actually play a significant role.
[time=3039] - Campaigning against unjust systems that oppress the poor
[time=3045] has always been a vital part of the church's heritage.
[time=3048] Holy Trinity Clapham in London was the spiritual home of William Wilberforce and the Clapham Saints who campaigned for the end of the slave trade almost 200 years ago.
[time=3059] Christian faith is inseparable from concern for the poor,
[time=3065] whether you're talking about Wilberforce or indeed, whether you're talking about the movement under Martin Luther King, Julia in the States or whether you're talking about Desmond Tutu and apartheid in South Africa, just to name a few.
[time=3077] The church has always been at its best leading the way in speaking up for the oppressed.
[time=3084] And I think the voice of God, the spirit of Isaiah 58 is constantly reminding us that God will not allow any kind of barricades between us and his concerns for the poor, so get rid of your sacrifices, get rid of the kind of fasting which oppresses the poor, get rid of your theological conundrums which creates obstacles between my passion for the poor and the needs of the poor and revise your politics if you need to.
[time=3114] - This isn't a radical message.
[time=3116] We're talking about radically requiring Christians to be 1% more generous.
[time=3121] I mean, that's what you're talking about.
[time=3122] You get in financial terms here.
[time=3124] There's nothing radical being asked of Christians.
[time=3126] It's align your heart with God, feel what he feels over the preventable suffering and death caused by extreme poverty.
[time=3135] And then move out of that heart.
[time=3137] Let his spirit move you to use the resources that he's given you to advance his purposes in the world.
[time=3142] - Understanding that it is possible to end extreme poverty
[time=3151] and that we have the very resources at our fingertips, it's exciting to visit churches where they don't simply believe this.
[time=3159] They live it out.
[time=3160] - It's not this the kind of fasting I have chosen.
[time=3164] It's a loose the chains of injustice.
[time=3167] - I'd say about 70% of our kids come from unchurched homes.
[time=3171] And most of those homes, they're probably living on welfare.
[time=3175] They're living in just poor neighborhoods.
[time=3177] It's not just them.
[time=3178] They're two brothers and parents that live in the house.
[time=3180] They probably have their grandmother and their grandfather and their aunts and uncles and cousins and they all live in maybe a two bedroom apartment.
[time=3186] But yet when it's time for them to be a church that they're giving everything they have.
[time=3190] [MUSIC - 13 seconds]
[time=3204] - In the heart of Queens, New York, is Christ's tabernacle.
[time=3208] It's a church actively reaching out to the poor, both locally and further afield.
[time=3212] [MUSIC - 3 seconds]
[time=3219] - That's the place you're going to.
[time=3220] - As a church on Wednesday, we all decided to fast one meal, whether it be breakfast, lunch, or dinner in a fast for global hunger to pray for those people who don't have a meal, you know, the less fortunate.
[time=3232] - When we ask our kids to fast and pray for the poor, it was really a place of the poor, fasting for the poor.
[time=3242] And they're willing to give up everything they have 'cause they know that God is calling them to do this.
[time=3248] - I would love to see world hunger come to an end because some teenagers in a poor neighborhood decided to fast for some people that were poorer than them.
[time=3257] - So what would you say to churches that would be nothing for the poor?
[time=3261] - Get to work, get to work, get to work.
[time=3263] 'Cause that's what we're here for.
[time=3265] - What we understand is that the practical is just as spiritual as the fast and as the prayer.
[time=3271] When you meet somebody where they're at and you meet their needs, they're gonna turn around and they're gonna ask, why'd you do this for me?
[time=3278] - They're pretty passionate about it, son.
[time=3279] - So passionate, 'cause it's why we exist as the church.
[time=3283] Just showing up for our meetings isn't enough.
[time=3286] We actually have to get out there.
[time=3287] That's why in the beginning of Isaiah, the prophecy comes through and he says, I'm tired of your meetings.
[time=3292] - Some of you have been calling out to God for so long and you've been wondering why he hasn't responded because he wanted you to step out, put your own insecurities, doubts, hurts and pain aside and fight someone else's battle.
[time=3306] Go on somebody else's behalf and pray for them because he promises if you pray for them, then he will meet you.
[time=3316] If you go to meet somebody else with the stuff that they're dealing with, you will see his glory come forth in your own life.
[time=3323] [MUSIC - 7 seconds]
[time=3332] - We have to be different.
[time=3334] We have to think differently, feel differently, see things differently and therefore those of us following Christ, we have to act differently.
[time=3343] - We know the power of our faith.
[time=3345] We know that we can move mountains.
[time=3346] We know that if we're bold and act out the way that God's called us to live that we can change things.
[time=3352] - When we wake up to that reality, that extreme poverty can be eradicated from earth, we will become indignant.
[time=3359] I don't know how to convince people to get out of their comfort zone.
[time=3363] - That I lived in for so long.
[time=3366] I mean it when I say that I wouldn't change my decision for anything.
[time=3369] - Now is the time to bring an end to the brutality of extreme poverty.
[time=3374] It's time to say this stops with us.
[time=3377] Join the unprecedented alliance of Christians worldwide and discover how you can live 58.
[time=3384] [MUSIC - 27 seconds]
[time=3418] - God is gonna use us to change the course of history.
[time=3422] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 53 seconds]
[time=3482] (gentle music)
