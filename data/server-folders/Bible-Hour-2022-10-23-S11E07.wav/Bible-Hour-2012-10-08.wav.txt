[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hey, it's great to be with you again.
[time=33] Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] I wanna just jog your memory if I can for a moment.
[time=37] If you'll think back to September, just a few weeks ago, we spent most of that month engaged in a study that was monumental for our family and significant for I know many of you who watched throughout the month of September.
[time=51] We called it Live 58.
[time=53] It was a simultaneous study of that incredible chapter in the Old Testament prophet, Isaiah, coupled with the viewing of a film that we saw.
[time=65] We saw it in four clips and the film itself was entitled Live 58, put out by Compassion International.
[time=72] And the whole purpose of that chapter and the whole purpose of that film is to show the heart of God, God's heart and God's mindset toward those in need.
[time=83] Physical need, poverty, yes, but also the spiritual poverty of sin.
[time=89] And the whole effort in September for us was to try and get our people, to try and remind ourselves that when our hearts, our values, our choices, our priorities are aligned with God's, that will show itself in a compassionate, sincere kind movement of his people toward justice and toward making things that are broken whole again.
[time=116] And we've just had an amazing time coming off that study and people have been asking me, "Hey, what are you guys going to do about all that we saw and all that we learned?" And I want to just send you to our website.
[time=127] Those of you who are out there in the broadcast audience, we want you to participate in this with us.
[time=132] We're calling it Redeeming Christmas.
[time=135] That's right.
[time=136] Our response to Live 58, the great truth of Isaiah 58, is to redeem Christmas this year.
[time=144] And I'll let you go to the site.
[time=146] I'll let you read about it, but I'm going to just tell you in short, we are hoping and praying even now that the Blackhawk family and you in our broadcast family will join us this year and not only give a gift as we do every year here at Blackhawk at the year end, we always give a gift above and beyond, and we always send that gift somewhere in the world where it can do something to actually help and bring restoration and bring hope.
[time=173] And this year, we want to go above and beyond and give, but we're also asking people to think and pray about how you approach Christmas, how you approach specifically gifts and purchases and the spending of money.
[time=186] And so go to the website, read about Redeeming Christmas, and I can't wait in the days and weeks to come to tell you more about where this gift is going.
[time=196] It has to do with the slave trade.
[time=198] It has to do with human trafficking.
[time=200] It has to do with some of the darkest stuff you've ever seen and we can't wait.
[time=204] Our hope is that God is going to allow us to be a part of bringing a gift that will literally bring freedom.
[time=211] So go to the website, blackhawkministries.org, click on Redeeming Christmas and learn more about what we're doing in response to God's call on our lives to live out the great truth of Isaiah 58.
[time=223] Thank you so much for tuning in.
[time=225] Thanks for being a part of our family, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=257] [MUSIC]
[time=261] I'm going to sing the Battle Rages on.
[time=279] The Battle Rages on.
[time=286] A storm and tempest roar.
[time=289] We can't win this fight.
[time=294] Inside our rebel hearts.
[time=300] We'll land down our weapons now.
[time=308] We'll raise a white flag.
[time=311] We surrender all to you.
[time=316] It's all for you.
[time=319] We'll raise a white flag.
[time=322] The war is over.

[time=327] Your love is won.

[time=336] We're on this holy ground.
[time=342] You made a way for peace.
[time=345] Laying your body down.
[time=350] You took our rightful place.
[time=356] This freedom song is more chill.
[time=363] We'll raise a white flag.
[time=367] And we surrender all to you.
[time=372] It's all for you.
[time=375] We'll raise a white flag.
[time=378] The war is over.

[time=754] We lift the cross.
[time=756] It did high, left it high.
[time=758] We lift the cross.
[time=760] A knock-back joke? That is just so dumb.
[time=763] Hey, Laura.
[time=764] The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
[time=766] He makes me to lie down in green patterns.
[time=767] What are you doing? It's me. It's Jesus.
[time=770] Jesus, we take up our cross every day for you.
[time=773] Well, thank you. But the cross is where it begins. Not ends.
[time=776] You are the beginning and the end, Lord Jesus, the Alpha and the Omega.
[time=782] It's all about you, Jesus. Guys, I just want you to be real with me.
[time=788] You are the heir, I breathe.
[time=791] Drew, I think it's great when you worship me.
[time=793] Oh, yes. Praise you, Lord Jesus.
[time=795] Sometimes it just feels like you're putting on a show.
[time=799] Lord, forgive me for putting on a show and for being fake.
[time=805] I forgive you, but-- Oh, yes. Praise you for your mercy, Lord Jesus.
[time=809] Guys, just say something you would normally say.
[time=813] Praise the Lord.
[time=815] Oh, yeah. No. You know, like if we were having a conversation, say what you would say.
[time=823] Okay, Drew, tell us a joke.
[time=826] What? You know, like you were before.
[time=830] That weren't holy, Lord.
[time=831] That's not a joke. Oh, I didn't mean that.
[time=836] What are you guys doing?
[time=838] Jesus, we are living for you, just like we always do.
[time=842] Don't live for me. Let me live with you in your everyday life.
[time=846] When I live with you, you'll understand who you are and what you're living for.
[time=851] I just want something a little bit deeper, but this is all you want.
[time=858] St. Patrick penned a prayer back in the third or fourth century
[time=866] that still remains famous to this day.
[time=868] A part of it goes like this.
[time=871] Christ be with me, Christ within me, Christ behind me, Christ before me, Christ beside me, Christ to win me, Christ to comfort and restore me, Christ in quiet, Christ in danger, Christ in hearts of all that love me, Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.
[time=898] Now I don't know exactly all that St. Patrick had in mind when he prayed that prayer, but I am convinced that a part of his plea was that the Christ who saved him would be with him in the everyday of life.
[time=916] Did Jesus really die just to gain myriads of robotic and ritualistic worshipers?
[time=923] I hope that's not what he gained by dying for me.
[time=927] The Bible says that Jesus died to gain friends and family,
[time=933] people who would relate with him in continual everyday conversation.
[time=938] No pretense, no show, no masquer facade,
[time=944] just real, honest, heartfelt relationship with Jesus.
[time=951] So may your Savior be within, beside, behind,
[time=957] before, beneath, above, and in you today.
[time=963] In maturity, what comes to your mind
[time=978] or better yet, who comes to your mind?
[time=982] When I say the word immature, immaturity, who's the most immature person you know?
[time=990] And you can insert your own name there if you want to.
[time=994] Think about it.
[time=995] Think about the most immature person that you know.
[time=1000] Think about what it's like when you have to bump into and rub shoulders with and experience the effect of immaturity
[time=1009] as it plays out.
[time=1010] It's a painful, painful thing when you're surrounded by it, when you suffer the consequences of it, whether it's your immaturity or someone else's immaturity has a way of jot these things down.
[time=1024] I'm going to give you four.
[time=1025] They're all going to start with D.
[time=1027] And I hope you can remember these things as we make our way through the week.
[time=1032] Think about this, immaturity has a way of disrupting.
[time=1037] Think about it.
[time=1038] Immaturity, when it's in full bloom, doing its thing, has a way of disrupting immaturity disrupts relationships.
[time=1046] Immaturity disrupts homes.
[time=1048] Immaturity disrupts marriages and businesses and teams.
[time=1052] Why does immaturity disrupt?
[time=1056] You know why immaturity disrupts immaturity disrupts because immaturity is characterized by this passion for and this commitment.
[time=1065] Immaturity has this commitment to taking.
[time=1069] Immaturity takes.
[time=1071] Immaturity never gives.
[time=1074] And because it's always taking, it is always disrupting because relationships and homes and marriages and businesses and teams weren't designed to just be taken from.
[time=1087] Immaturity disrupts can't have a good marriage.
[time=1090] You can't have a good relationship.
[time=1092] You can't have a good home with immaturity rearing its head.
[time=1098] Immaturity has a way of destroying.
[time=1100] Write that one down.
[time=1101] Immaturity has a way of destroying.
[time=1104] It destroys trust.
[time=1106] It destroys reputation.
[time=1108] It destroys opportunity.
[time=1110] It destroys partnerships.
[time=1112] Think of an example from your own life.
[time=1114] Think of an example that you're aware of where you saw immaturity destroying these things.
[time=1122] Trust and reputation and partnerships.
[time=1125] How does this happen?
[time=1126] How is it that immaturity destroys?
[time=1128] Immaturity destroys because immaturity is always about immediate gratification.
[time=1134] Immaturity is always about having it now.
[time=1138] Immaturity wants it now.
[time=1142] Immaturity wants immediate satisfaction and is averse to long-term integrity.
[time=1152] Immaturity has a way of disrupting, destroying.
[time=1154] It has a way of distracting.
[time=1157] Think about this.
[time=1158] Immaturity has a way of distracting.
[time=1161] Mostly the immature one from the responsibilities, opportunities, or needed disciplines that he or she could greatly benefit from.
[time=1174] Were they engaged?
[time=1175] Were they paying attention?
[time=1176] Were they willing?
[time=1178] Immaturity has a way of distracting from the responsibility and needed disciplines.
[time=1184] Why?
[time=1185] Because immaturity is allergic to hard work.
[time=1193] Immaturity wants no part of hard work.
[time=1200] Immaturity has a way of detaching.
[time=1204] That's the fourth D for you this morning.
[time=1206] Immaturity has a way also of detaching.
[time=1209] What do we mean by that?
[time=1210] Immaturity has a way of isolating you.
[time=1214] If you're immature, if I'm immature, as we find ourselves in this immature state, it has a way of keeping us away.
[time=1223] Immaturity keeps people away from two things.
[time=1226] Wisdom and accountability.
[time=1230] In our immaturity, we distance ourselves from wisdom and accountability.
[time=1238] Because wisdom and accountability will always require from you.
[time=1243] They always require for me.
[time=1246] Wisdom and accountability always requires effort.
[time=1251] It always requires action.
[time=1254] Wisdom and accountability is always calling you and calling me to do something.
[time=1259] Often times something that's painful, sacrificial, meaningful, then immaturity would much rather be entertained.
[time=1273] Immaturity is an absolute killer because immaturity is selfish.
[time=1280] Immaturity is divisive.
[time=1282] Immaturity is lazy and it's short-sighted.
[time=1286] Now as we jump into this this morning, I want to make sure that we're clear on what I mean by immaturity.
[time=1291] Please know I'm not talking about childishness.
[time=1296] I'm talking about foolishness.
[time=1300] In the physical, real arena, we can talk about this.
[time=1303] We can also talk about this in the spiritual arena.
[time=1306] But please understand, when we talk about immaturity and as we go to the Scriptures this morning and learn more about immaturity, I want you to have in mind that what we're talking about here isn't childishness.
[time=1319] We're talking about foolishness.
[time=1322] I remember the days when we had kids run around the house with sippy cups.
[time=1327] Raise your hand if you've ever had sippy cups in your house.
[time=1329] So we all remember sippy cups.
[time=1330] So I remember watching a little guy or a little gal get a thing full of juice or milk and they take that sippy cup and I always used to get a kick out of it.
[time=1338] They never took the sippy cup to their mouth slowly.
[time=1340] It was just boom!
[time=1344] Sippy cup, you know what I mean?
[time=1346] They just suck it on that thing and it's just boom quick, you know?
[time=1350] And then they get to be the age where you start using real cups and it was always kind of funny those first couple times, you know, with the glass now full of whatever and boom and it's all over them and it's on their chair.
[time=1360] It's in their hair and what do you do?
[time=1362] Do you get mad at them for being foolish?
[time=1366] No, that's just, they'll get that figured out, right?
[time=1369] They have no way of knowing how that was going to go.
[time=1372] That's not immaturity.
[time=1374] It's just growing up, you figure these things out.
[time=1379] Immaturity is when they're pouring milk on their head at age nine
[time=1386] because they should have known what?
[time=1389] They should have known better.
[time=1392] This is immaturity.
[time=1394] You should know better.
[time=1404] But for some reason, you are not and you're immature.
[time=1412] And if you're not better, if you're not mature today, if you're immature and if we are a family and you're part of us designed by God to be this body of believers effective in His service, effective in His kingdom as we grow, if you're not mature, if I'm immature, if you're not growing, you're killing us.
[time=1447] You're killing this effort.
[time=1449] I'm hurting our cause.
[time=1452] If there's immaturity in the ranks, if you will,
[time=1458] then it diminishes and slows down and it alters what God designed for us to be as a growing body.
[time=1467] You're killing us, you're killing yourself because if you're not growing, you're dying.
[time=1474] I believe that with all my heart.
[time=1475] And if you don't think so, ask, ask was fun.
[time=1479] It was really fun, the last week or so, to look through this unbelievable book and think about it.
[time=1485] And maybe you could do this later.
[time=1486] You'd come up with three other ones, I'm sure.
[time=1489] But it was great to look through this book and even talk to friends about it during the week.
[time=1493] Examples of people in her who were immature.
[time=1497] Examples of people in the pages of scripture whose immaturity killed them.
[time=1503] I mean, literally or figuratively.
[time=1505] Examples of people here in the scriptures who knew what?
[time=1510] Who knew better?
[time=1512] But they were not willing to go forward to step forward with maturity and growth.
[time=1518] I was thinking about Samson.
[time=1520] Samson, you're going to read the story of Samson and judges 13 through 16.
[time=1524] Samson empowered by God, called by God.
[time=1527] Samson was very aware of who God was and of God's power and God's calling.
[time=1532] Samson empowered and strengthened literally by God through this Nazarite bow and the long hair.
[time=1538] Most of you know the story.
[time=1540] And God was really clear about how he was supposed to live and what he was to avoid and how the hair was never to be.
[time=1546] And Delilah comes in with Delilah comes all this opportunity for immature, short-sighted compromise and he gives in to Delilah and the hair gets whacked and he gets captured.
[time=1559] And before you know it, this glorious servant of God given strength to move his people forward as in shackles, he's in chains, his head shaved, his eyes are gouged out.
[time=1572] And he dies this horrific sad death under the custody
[time=1578] of the Philistines.
[time=1581] Immaturity, he should have known better.
[time=1584] I was thinking about Jonah, called by God again.
[time=1588] What a great, great, sad picture of immaturity.
[time=1592] Jonah, very aware of God.
[time=1593] Very aware of God's calling.
[time=1595] God says to Jonah, I want you to go to Nineveh.
[time=1597] And it's the classic whining, complaining, immature.
[time=1602] I don't want to go to Nineveh.
[time=1605] You can hear him.
[time=1606] I don't want to go to Nineveh.
[time=1610] And so he gets on the boat as he tries to hide and the boat thing doesn't work out so well and he gets tossed and literally finds himself in the belly of the big fish and tossed out on the shore and finally goes to Nineveh.
[time=1624] God does what God called him to do initially.
[time=1626] God responds, people come to faith.
[time=1629] Jonah's mad because there's agenda.
[time=1631] Again, immature people always have agendas.
[time=1635] And it's not God's, it's theirs.
[time=1636] And so when the agenda thing gets all conflicted and what happens, Jonah doesn't like.
[time=1641] He ends up under this tree whining and complaining.
[time=1644] And it's a sad picture.
[time=1646] Think about Judas.
[time=1648] Think about Judas is scary at both.
[time=1650] If there was ever somebody in the pages of Scripture who just blew it, somebody who knew Jesus, somebody who walked with Jesus, somebody who did ministry with Jesus, somebody who heard all the teachings and watched all the miracles, somebody who should have known what, say it better.
[time=1671] And then all of a sudden you see this immaturity thing, the shortsightedness, the instant gratification, the disruption, the destruction, the distraction, and boom, 30 pieces of silver.
[time=1685] Yeah, I'll take it.
[time=1686] Kisses Jesus in the garden, betrays him.
[time=1688] Jesus goes to be crucified.
[time=1691] Can't live with himself.
[time=1692] Most of you know the end of that story ends up on the end of a row hanging off a tree, kills himself.
[time=1698] Can I ask Samson?
[time=1699] Can I ask Jonah?
[time=1700] Can I ask Judas?
[time=1703] You could ask the 42-year-old guy.
[time=1707] I met with last month, now living alone in a local apartment,
[time=1717] visiting his three teenage kids on the weekends, looking for a job that he's now lost with a wife so hurt and humiliated she may never recover, all because, as he told the story, all because 20 years ago, they begged him to get help.
[time=1737] They begged him to grow.
[time=1741] They begged him to, with God's help and with the spirit of God and the word of God and the people of God's help, they begged him to make right what was 20 years ago, clearly wrong, and he wouldn't do it.
[time=1757] And so he lived and compromised.
[time=1760] Gradually became greater levels of sin and disobedience and today, very sets.
[time=1767] 42 in a loan and apartment with wife and family estranged and no job wondering how in the world he's going to survive.
[time=1776] How do you survive?
[time=1778] Friends, you grow.
[time=1780] You don't sit still.
[time=1783] You keep growing.
[time=1785] You keep allowing the spirit of God and the word of God and the people of God to grow you.
[time=1792] You repent when you sin, you make it right when you fail, and you roll up your sleeves and together we grow because if you're not growing, you're dying.
[time=1800] In this discussion, friends, there is no neutral.
[time=1806] We've got to grow.
[time=1807] Hebrews 5, let's look at it.
[time=1809] We'll look at this this morning.
[time=1810] We'll have a great time next week making our way to 1 Corinthians 3, but would you look at Hebrews 5?
[time=1815] And as you turn to Hebrews 5, would you stand in honor of Scripture and allow me the privilege of reading this to you this morning?
[time=1823] I want to read this to you.
[time=1824] Normally, if you know me, I read to you from my Bible, which is an N-A-S-B.
[time=1830] But I want to read you this morning from the N-L-T.
[time=1832] I've told you about the N-L-T over the recent years.
[time=1836] When we read the Bible at home, sometimes I'll have my younger kids read.
[time=1839] They keep reading to me out of their N-L-T.
[time=1844] And every time I read and then I hear them read, I like there's better.
[time=1848] And so I've just been having a great time lately doing more and more with this translation.
[time=1853] I love it.
[time=1853] It's in the N-L-T.
[time=1854] I want you to see the screen.
[time=1856] It says there is much here is the author.
[time=1858] Listen, here's the author of Hebrews writing to these folks and their spiritual maturity is the issue.
[time=1867] There's an issue here.
[time=1868] There's a problem and he says there is much more.
[time=1871] We would like to say about this, but it is difficult to explain, especially since you are spiritually dull and don't
[time=1880] seem to listen.
[time=1883] It goes on in verse 12 to say, "You have been believers so long now that you ought to be teaching others.
[time=1890] Instead, you need someone to teach you again the basic things about God's Word.
[time=1895] You are like babies who need milk and cannot eat solid food.
[time=1901] For someone who lives on milk is still an infant and doesn't know how to do what is right." And then it says in verse 14, "Solid food is for those who are mature who through training have the skill to recognize the difference between right and wrong." Uh-oh.
[time=1924] I mean, we'll get to this, but I just read that and then I just, it's just, it hits me like a ton of bricks.
[time=1928] You don't know right from wrong.
[time=1931] You struggle with right from wrong when you're spiritually immature, right?
[time=1938] All right, we'll get to that.
[time=1940] Our Father in Heaven, we just stand here as a family and we pray, God, that your Holy Spirit would empower and anoint my
[time=1950] feeble words.
[time=1952] God, we pray that your spirit and your Word would break through here this morning in our hearts and minds, whoever we are, wherever we've been, whatever's transpiring God in our lives today, may this message, may these truths make a difference.
[time=1968] And all the people agreed with the prayer and said, you can be seated.
[time=1973] All right, let's shoot straight here this morning.
[time=1975] This passage is in essence saying this, here are some characteristics of spiritual immaturity.
[time=1982] It's what this, I just read to you those verses and all those verses are saying is, here you go, gang, here are a handful of principles that will show you what spiritual immaturity looks like.
[time=1993] Now, it's not the end of the world.
[time=1994] If you identify with these three things this morning, like I do at times, it doesn't mean game over.
[time=2000] It just means you and I've got some work to do.
[time=2003] We can make progress.
[time=2004] There is growth that can occur.
[time=2006] Fruitfulness can come, but here are some very clear characteristics of the spiritually immature person.
[time=2014] And number one, you don't listen.
[time=2018] You don't listen.
[time=2021] Verse 11 said it, and see it right there?
[time=2023] There's much more we'd like to say, but it's difficult to say it to you because you are spiritually dull and don't seem to what?
[time=2031] Say it out loud, church.
[time=2033] Listen, you've become, according to the text, spiritually dull.
[time=2039] What it's saying there is that you have become spiritually not very sharp, spiritually sluggish, personally and spiritually lazy, dull, and this dullness, all of it tied to this picture of you no longer being one who really listens.
[time=2058] What's listening?
[time=2060] Let's just be reminded of this this morning and let's be very clear about it.
[time=2062] What is listening?
[time=2066] Remember now, according to the concise Oxford dictionary, and I think it'll be on the screen there, according to the concise Oxford dictionary, the definition of hearing is to perceive sound with the ear.
[time=2081] So stop right there.
[time=2083] All of you in the room this morning are hearing me right now.
[time=2086] You're hearing that I'm talking.
[time=2088] You hear my voice amplified.
[time=2091] Hearing is going on widespread right now.
[time=2094] Absolutely no doubt about it because hearing is to perceive sound with the ear, whereas listening is to consider what
[time=2104] you're hearing with thoughtful attention.
[time=2108] So hearing is a physical thing, but listening is a cognitive big word here.
[time=2114] What?
[time=2115] Response.
[time=2118] A cognitive response to what has been heard, which is why I'm
[time=2124] completely rethinking the parenting thing over the last week as I've been studying this.
[time=2130] I've been convicted because you can ask my kids a day doesn't go by where in my conversations with them.
[time=2136] I just I always say this to them.
[time=2138] I say, did you hear me?
[time=2141] Can you see me saying that?
[time=2143] Did you hear me?
[time=2146] You know, I say it nicely.
[time=2148] Did you hear me?
[time=2150] I said intensely.
[time=2151] Did you hear me?
[time=2153] Did you hear it's the wrong I've been asking the wrong question because they all look at me and say, yes, we hear you.
[time=2161] But I don't want their hearing.
[time=2164] You don't want your kids hearing.
[time=2167] We want kids to what?
[time=2169] Say it.
[time=2170] Listen.
[time=2172] Wrong question.
[time=2174] Right question is, are you listening?
[time=2176] Because while I'm thankful that you hear me and same thing from God to us, thankful that you hear me.
[time=2184] I want a cognitive response.
[time=2188] You've got to do it.
[time=2192] Not just hear it somewhere.
[time=2196] For those of you in the room this morning who find yourselves spiritually immature.
[time=2202] I mean, we're verse 10, I know, but maybe the dull not listening thing, maybe it's resonating with you.
[time=2208] And for you, I would just say somewhere along the road of your spiritual journey, you stopped responding to what you were
[time=2217] hearing.
[time=2219] You stopped listening to spiritual inputs, response, action, doing, it sharpens.
[time=2227] There's nothing dull going on with the one who responds because responding homes are character.
[time=2235] Responding develops.
[time=2238] The spiritual nature, response, action, doing, it sharpens, not listening, not responding dulls us.
[time=2247] And here's the scary truth.
[time=2248] Listen, here's the scary truth about dull.
[time=2252] The more you keep not listening.
[time=2256] And I get worried about this.
[time=2260] When we think about our kids, we never want to see this happen with our kids.
[time=2263] I get worried about this spiritually.
[time=2267] When I think about many of you, as I watch you navigate stuff,
[time=2273] the more you keep not listening, not responding, the duller you
[time=2280] get, and the more likely it is that your heart will simply in time harden.
[time=2287] That is what is at the end of not listening.
[time=2291] A hard, detached, calloused heart.
[time=2296] Romans 121 describes it really well.
[time=2300] Romans 121, yes, they knew God.
[time=2302] There you go.
[time=2304] They heard.
[time=2306] But they wouldn't worship Him as God or even give Him thanks.
[time=2309] And they began to think up foolish ideas.
[time=2312] That's what immature people do.
[time=2316] They think up foolish ideas of what God was like as a result.
[time=2320] Their minds became dark and confused.
[time=2327] So I stand here this morning and I beg you as your friend and pastor to grow as a listener.
[time=2336] To grow.
[time=2337] Today, to start growing as somebody who not only hears, but actually responds.
[time=2345] I am begging you to begin to, in small ways or even significant ways, put feet to your faith.
[time=2353] I'm asking you to go back and think about this.
[time=2355] Where did you stop listening?
[time=2359] There was a time when you listened.
[time=2363] There was a time when your life was characterized by spiritual inputs.
[time=2368] There was a time when you were, you were taking in messages.
[time=2372] You were taking in teachings.
[time=2375] You were taking in truth being spoken to you by those that were caring for you and counseling you or discipling you or mentoring you.
[time=2384] There was this time where your life was characterized by this pattern of receiving inputs and then acting upon them as you listened.
[time=2398] And what happened?
[time=2401] Where did it kind of go sideways for you?
[time=2405] What choices got made?
[time=2406] What relationships pulled you away?
[time=2409] What disciplines began to erode?
[time=2414] What patterns in your life started to develop that have brought you to this place where with the audience of Hebrews, you align yourself and you can receive this just like they received it.
[time=2427] I am dull, I'm not sharp spiritually, and I'm not listening anymore.
[time=2436] So here are three things.
[time=2438] I hope you'll do this.
[time=2439] I hope you'll do every one of these three things.
[time=2442] And it is meaningless for me to stand up here and teach you without giving you a chance to apply it.
[time=2447] So here's three ways that you can apply this.
[time=2450] Ask somebody this week, pray about it.
[time=2454] Maybe before the sun goes down on you today, maybe it gets that clear, if not this week, ask someone for help.
[time=2460] Ask for help from a trusted friend or acquaintance to move you toward doing.
[time=2467] You will never become a listener on your own.
[time=2472] It'll never happen in isolation.
[time=2474] Call her.
[time=2475] Call him.
[time=2476] Ask them to meet you.
[time=2478] Sit there.
[time=2478] Look them in the eye and say, would you just meet with me on a weekly basis?
[time=2482] Could we pray together?
[time=2484] Could we read the Scripture together?
[time=2485] Could you encourage me to apply God's truth in my life?
[time=2491] Here's where I could use some encouragement.
[time=2493] Everybody in this room could do that.
[time=2496] This is not rocket science.
[time=2498] And you need help because you're dull and you don't listen.
[time=2502] And so you can change that by inviting people into your life to prompt you and nudge you and love you toward listening, toward doing.
[time=2512] Secondly, respond today to live 58.
[time=2515] That makes no sense to you right now.
[time=2516] But I promise you, by the time we're done today, you are going to be absolutely overwhelmed and grateful for the opportunity that God is giving you today to actually put feet to your faith.
[time=2528] We'll get to that later.
[time=2528] Thirdly, respond, apply to at least one principle.
[time=2534] Respond to at least one principle a week from the Sunday morning teachings here in our gathering.
[time=2541] Make a commitment today to respond to apply to at least apply at least one principle a week from the gathering over the next seven weeks, two weeks of grow or die.
[time=2551] Then come the five weeks of grow groups.
[time=2554] We'll also start the book of James in two weeks.
[time=2558] But make a commitment today to be somebody who on a weekly basis is committing
[time=2564] to God and maybe that person you call back up in point one to apply at least one principle from our messages on Sunday mornings.
[time=2571] You could do this.
[time=2572] You could get help on this by going to double exposure.
[time=2575] Double exposure is a new Sunday morning community that meets right now, second hour.
[time=2579] So you'd have to change your schedule and go to double exposure.
[time=2582] It's a growing Sunday morning community that meets to do one thing.
[time=2586] They take the message from first hour and they apply it to their lives.
[time=2590] Second hour immediate application of the message that morning.
[time=2595] Room 176 right down the hall, Steve Gardner, Steve Longbreak, Phil Ferguson.
[time=2600] It's a tremendous team of facilitators and teachers.
[time=2603] Grow, my friends.
[time=2605] I am begging you to grow as a listener.
[time=2610] No more dull.
[time=2613] Secondly, second trait of spiritual immaturity.
[time=2618] According to our text here in Hebrews 5 is that the spiritually immature person shows little if no initiative.
[time=2625] You have stopped taking initiative.
[time=2628] You say initiative with what?
[time=2631] Well, let me just read the verse to you again.
[time=2632] Verse 12, look at verse 12.
[time=2634] I'm going to read it to you again from the NLT.
[time=2636] You have been believer so long, he says.
[time=2639] You've been believer so long now that you ought to be teaching others.
[time=2643] And I want you just to stop right there and look at that.
[time=2647] You've been a believer long enough.
[time=2649] He says that you ought to be passing along God's wisdom.
[time=2654] You ought to be passing along God's truth.
[time=2660] You ought to be, the whole phrase here talks about spiritually investing in others.
[time=2668] You know enough, you've been around enough, you've been invested in enough yourself.
[time=2673] You ought to be doing that yourselves.
[time=2676] Instead, you need someone to teach you again the basic things about God's Word.
[time=2682] It's been so long, you've gotten lax.
[time=2690] You're like babies who need milk and cannot eat solid food.
[time=2696] In this passage, spiritual maturity is equated with you passing along spiritual
[time=2702] investment toward others.
[time=2704] And my friends, there is a growing number of you here in this room this morning.
[time=2708] And on the spiritually helping others front, on the teaching, discipling front, on the guiding, spiritually mentoring front, however you want to say that.
[time=2719] There is a growing number of you here in this room who should be doing more.
[time=2724] You should be doing more than you are.
[time=2729] And I don't have my ruler out.
[time=2731] I'm not slapping you on your wrist.
[time=2733] This isn't a guilt trip.
[time=2734] This isn't me trying to make you feel bad.
[time=2736] I'm telling you after all the years God has given me with you and all the relationships
[time=2742] God has given us here in this room and the close nittness of this family.
[time=2748] There comes with that knowledge and perspective and I'm just telling you that we believe
[time=2756] there are many of you who because of the investment that has been made into you is room
[time=2764] for you to be doing more, more of what more of what the passage just talked about, spiritually investing in others.
[time=2773] Some of you junior high, dads and moms, some of you, some of you junior high dads and moms
[time=2781] should be showing up at liquid, our middle school ministry volunteering with duty and
[time=2787] dray as they give leadership to help maybe lead a small group of 12, 13 year old boys
[time=2794] and girls.
[time=2797] How painful, I mean how great does that sound?
[time=2800] No, I'm serious.
[time=2803] How great does that sound?
[time=2807] A 13 year old today, a 12 year old, a 13 year old, a 14 year old in this culture.
[time=2818] Oh my goodness, the wisdom that they need and the love that they need and the parameters
[time=2825] and the guidance that they need to be young men and young women who honor God in this society.
[time=2834] Wow, you ought to be lining up to go make an investment in their hearts and lives.
[time=2845] Some of you, I say some because there are others of you, moms and dads of junior high kids and you're up to your eyeballs in commitment, you're doing a fantastic job and we're grateful.
[time=2856] Some of you college age, some of you college age young men and women, post high school,
[time=2866] single adult, young married, I don't care, 18 to 30, just say that.
[time=2872] Some of you ought to be rolling up your sleeves and calling Luke Sefton, Luke Sefton gives
[time=2878] leadership to our high school ministry.
[time=2880] You want to talk about a ministry, you want to talk about an opportunity, you want to talk about a chance to pass along wisdom and accountability, be a 15, 16, 17, 18 year old
[time=2892] today, be a 17 year old navigating this world, somehow trying to stand with strength and
[time=2901] conviction in the face of just an absolute daily talk about hour by hour on slot of temptation
[time=2912] and messages that are utterly and thoroughly anti-God and anti-faith and anti-truth, they
[time=2920] need help.
[time=2921] And you know what, many of you in this room could help them, you could meet with them,
[time=2927] you could model for them, you could learn with them, you could love them.
[time=2934] Some of you that are in ABF, Sunday morning community, some of you that are in home groups, you know, small communities that meet during the week in a living room somewhere, some of all of you who meet in community today, and there's a lot of you, really many of you
[time=2950] need to start thinking about not meeting with the community you're with, and quite honestly,
[time=2958] many of you have been with that community forever.
[time=2962] Many of you need to start thinking about prayerfully and strategically and with our help starting
[time=2968] a new community with, here you go, new people that you don't know, that you might could
[time=2976] get to know better, who today are on the outside looking in around here at community, because
[time=2984] we need help from people who know, who understand, who have been invested in.
[time=2998] Milk here in our passage, I just want to show you this, I want to make sure that you get this and that you see this.
[time=3005] Milk here in our passage creates this powerful graphic picture of not being grown up, right?
[time=3013] Infancy, baby, slobbering, infant pictures, I understand all that, but I want you to take a look again at verse 12, because again, it's not making that one-for-one comparison, it's
[time=3025] really saying, well, let me just read it to you again here.
[time=3029] For though by this time, or I'll read it to you in the NLT, you have been believers so long that you ought to be teaching others, instead you need someone to teach you, and
[time=3039] there's the word I want you to focus on, say it again, again.
[time=3045] You have need again, he's talking to those of you who were already taught, he's talking
[time=3053] to those of you who really do know, he's talking to those of you who are actually very aware,
[time=3060] but you never passed it along to others.
[time=3063] You've never taken the initiative to, through obedience, sharpen yourself by investing in
[time=3071] others.
[time=3072] You know, the great tragedy here, my friends, is this, it's on the screen.
[time=3076] Knowledge without, what, obedience.
[time=3083] Knowledge without obedience makes you a baby.
[time=3091] Knowledge, month after month, year after year, knowledge without obedience makes you immature,
[time=3100] and if you're immature, you're not growing, and if you're not growing, you're what?
[time=3105] You're dying.
[time=3109] You should be spiritually influencing others, but instead you need to be influenced again.
[time=3118] Last week I'm going to bring you to 1 Corinthians 3, 1 to 3, and I'm going to show you the biggest culprit in this whole endeavor.
[time=3125] I'm going to answer the question for you, so why is it, why is it that you knew, why
[time=3131] is it that you got taught, why is it that you're aware, but you never passed it along?
[time=3136] Why are we here now, why are you immature, and what happened?
[time=3142] What is it that took place, that got you so far off track?
[time=3147] The one word, it's a two word answer, and we've got to look at it, we've got to answer
[time=3153] it honestly, and then next week we'll talk about doing something about it, and I hope you'll come back.
[time=3161] Let me just pray for us then.
[time=3162] We're going to move on.
[time=3163] I'm going to ask the band if they'd make their way back up.
[time=3165] Our Father in Heaven, our prayer as we end this morning, as we end this message is simple
[time=3172] and clear, God, we would ask that you would in your Word and your Spirit would give us
[time=3178] strength to be doers of the Word.
[time=3183] The book of James talks about the tragedy of one who looks at himself in the mirror,
[time=3189] and as soon as he walks away he forgets, oh God, we don't want to be forgetful hearers.
[time=3197] We want to, as the text says, be effectual doers.
[time=3201] Oh God, help us to listen, help us to have a response to what it is you've given us,
[time=3208] and may that response God be powerful and God honoring may it represent real obedience
[time=3214] for us in our own lives.
[time=3216] We pray in your son's name.
[time=3219] [AMEN] All right church, here we go.
[time=3224] I've been so looking forward to this.
[time=3228] You got a handout, and this isn't like unrelated to the last 35 minutes, so don't check out on me.
[time=3234] This is all about what we just taught you, but it's also about living 58 at Blackhawk.
[time=3241] Most of you know that over the last four weeks we've been engaged in a series that we've entitled Live 58, we've studied the chapter, Isaiah 58, watched the film, and as we studied
[time=3252] the chapter, and watched the film, it became very clear to us that God's desire is that
[time=3259] we as His people would be willing to put feet to faith, that we would align ourselves and
[time=3265] our choices and our commitments with His heart for those in need.
[time=3269] And so on this sheet, and I know you've been looking at it all morning, are real every day needs of real everyday people.
[time=3278] Many of these represent chances for you and I to make a difference right here in our own community.
[time=3284] A couple of them are worlds away.
[time=3287] Either way, we want to be a people who are willing and ready to step forward and make
[time=3293] a commitment, and I've overseen the putting together of this.
[time=3299] Others did it, and they did a fantastic job, but I know there isn't anything on here that
[time=3306] you can't do.
[time=3307] I know that.
[time=3308] There's nothing out of the realm of possibility, and so what we're going to do is we're going to start to worship God again here as we close.
[time=3315] Every one of these descriptions, as you read through it, has a color, there's a colored
[time=3321] card that's noted in your description, and all those cards are right here.
[time=3328] And I'm going to ask that you would just be quiet before God, just take a moment, and
[time=3334] ask him which one of these is you.
[time=3337] What commitment do you need to make today?
[time=3340] To just make a dent, to make a real dent in the world of need.
[time=3349] So there's the need, there's the opportunities.
[time=3353] Here's the card.
[time=3354] You come and you make a commitment by taking the card and doing what it says on the card.
[time=3361] God bless you.
[time=3362] And I thank you for your encouragement and your support over the last several weeks of Live 58.
[time=3367] I can't wait to see what God's going to do with redeeming Christmas.
[time=3372] I can't wait to see what God's going to do with you this morning.
[time=3374] Let's worship our God and let's make our way up when the time is right to get your card.
[time=3392] [MUSIC]
[time=3420] You won't let into you, have it all my heart is yours.
[time=3463] Because there you as a seal upon my heart as a seal upon my heart, for there is love that
[time=3483] is as strong as death, jealousy demanding as the grave and many waters cannot quench this
[time=3500] so you won't let into you, have it all my heart is yours.
