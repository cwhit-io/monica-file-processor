[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Well hello again everybody, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=35] It's great to have you with us and I'm so grateful for what you've been able to see and really participate in these last several weeks.
[time=42] What a month or so it's been.
[time=45] If you've been watching the Bible Hour, you know we've spent four weeks or so in Isaiah 58.
[time=51] We called it Live 58 and what an incredible experience it was to not only study that text but to watch that film which now I know many of you have watched as well.
[time=62] I know it has prompted many of you to respond in your own lives, in your own worlds, living out the heart of God.
[time=70] We've heard from a number of you who watched the film and went through the study with us and we're so grateful for what God did through Live 58.
[time=77] Then two weeks of grow or die.
[time=80] We've been studying in the New Testament the great theme of spiritual growth, spiritual formation, how absolutely vital it is that we as believers keep growing because if we're not growing, we are dying.
[time=94] There is no neutral in spiritual growth.
[time=96] You're either going forward or you're regressing and when we regress towards spiritual immaturity, boy we've seen over the last few weeks that there's just nothing but pain and heartache and loss and so it's been good to see so many of you responding to that as well.
[time=112] Now as you watch this today, we're on the brink of starting a new series in the book of James.
[time=118] We're gonna be studying the entire book of James over the next five, six weeks and we would love to have you come and be with us live in the room as we open up God's word and do what we oftentimes do here at Black Talk.
[time=131] We simply take a book of the Bible and we just kind of chunk by chunk passage by passage, make our way through what God's word has to say to us today.
[time=141] We believe God's word is true, we believe God's word is relevant.
[time=145] We believe it speaks to all the issues of life and I can't wait for you to see the issues of life that James speaks to.
[time=153] It's gonna be a tremendous study and I hope you'll join us and be a part of that.
[time=157] I also wanna just remind you that on our website, if you go to the media section, you can get to a place where it says digging deeper.
[time=165] Digging deeper, I think we can even show it to you on the screen here, just a picture of what that looks like.
[time=172] Digging deeper is a chance for all of you to go to our website and download or just interact with the screen.
[time=179] It's a study put together by Steve Webster, one of our teaching pastors of that week's message and it gives you a chance to further study, further do your devotions, further think, further consider the truth surrounding that week's message gives you a chance to dig a little deeper.
[time=197] I hope you'll utilize that resource.
[time=199] It's a huge encouragement.
[time=201] I know to many, many people who interact with it on a regular basis.
[time=205] Hey, God bless you, I'm so thankful that you tuned in, so grateful that we get to have this relationship and this time together.
[time=212] We love you, we're thankful for you.
[time=214] And as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=556] (audience applauding) (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 175 seconds]
[time=737] (audience applauding) - Many of you got a letter this week.
[time=743] If you didn't, we can get you one this week over at the office.
[time=746] We're gonna post a link to the letter on our Facebook page and on my Twitter account tomorrow.
[time=754] The letter basically was my best effort at trying to communicate to you an amazing process that God has brought Corbin and Tanya through really in these last couple of years.
[time=765] I have been and I mean this privileged to be able to walk with them through all of this.
[time=771] And the letter basically communicated that they have decided in recent days to begin transitioning from their full-time opportunity here at Blackhawk.
[time=782] An opportunity we've all been the beneficiaries of for the last 10 years.
[time=788] To a new full-time opportunity with an incredible organization called Josiah Venture.
[time=795] Josiah Ventures doing incredible ministry in Eastern Europe there in about 12, 13 countries.
[time=802] And there is some musical worship choir ministry going on that is truly phenomenal.
[time=809] And Corbin and Tanya are going to serve in that regard in the country of Poland, by the way.
[time=816] Poland is where this whole thing ends up.
[time=819] Yeah, it is crazy.
[time=821] I don't even think you can say anything in Polish yet, can you?
[time=824] No.
[time=825] So we got a ways to go on the language training front.
[time=828] But certainly a sad, thrilling, hard, exciting process for me.
[time=842] I can throw, yeah, they can throw scary and for sure.
[time=846] They had this conversation with their girls this last week.
[time=850] That was another big step.
[time=852] And we want to just, like I said in the letter, we're just going to walk with them every step of the way.
[time=858] Probably about six to 12 months.
[time=861] Most importantly, in December, we got a baby coming.
[time=864] So we're going to put all this sort of on hold for a bit and just celebrate with them as December draws near.
[time=869] In the first part of the year, they'll begin more involvement, more intensive involvement in the process of raising support and all that comes with that.
[time=877] And I believe with all of me that God is going to watch over them and I believe with all of me that God is going to watch over us.
[time=886] And there are transitions that take place in ministry that are for really bad reasons.
[time=895] And this isn't one of those.
[time=897] We can rejoice in that.
[time=899] This is a great, great thing.
[time=902] We have been talking for years to you about being priests who stay.
[time=907] No.
[time=908] We've been talking about how this is a family of priests who what?
[time=912] Who go?
[time=913] Cross the street, cross the country, cross the world.
[time=918] So Poland, here we come.
[time=921] So this is really all your fault.
[time=923] Yes.
[time=924] Because if he wouldn't have started preaching all that stuff.
[time=927] That's true.
[time=928] We'd still be here.
[time=930] It's sort of a weird thing, but an exciting thing like Kelly was saying.
[time=936] I'd love to tell you about Sermon I heard on the radio a few months ago.
[time=941] The pastor was preaching on the book of Revelation and he kind of stopped and he said, "Hey Church, you know what God's favorite song is?
[time=948] I like to sing so I listened extra close." And he said, "God's favorite song is a new one." All through the Bible it talks about a new song and God has these new ideas.
[time=959] He's so creative.
[time=960] He didn't just stop creating new things on day seven.
[time=964] In a sense, he's got new ideas and new ways for his church to grow and change
[time=970] and morph.
[time=971] And I just felt like that was true for us.
[time=974] It's just kind of a new thing that God's doing.
[time=977] And new things can be a little unnerving and they require lots of faith and trust in him, which is a great place for anybody to be.
[time=987] So we're really excited about that.
[time=989] We're really thankful for Kelly.
[time=991] Like he said, I just want to reiterate, you know, this isn't a reason to just be done with Blackhawk.
[time=998] We love Blackhawk.
[time=999] We love Kelly and the elders.
[time=1001] And in a way we see this as a chance to stay in Blackhawk but in a new capacity.
[time=1007] We really do.
[time=1008] And when God started prompting and stirring and we wanted to test and approve what his good will was and went to his office first.
[time=1015] And it just said sit down and we need to talk about something.
[time=1019] It's a little bit different.
[time=1020] It's a little bit new and I need your help because he's my mentor and he's my friend.
[time=1025] So we've been in the loop with each other from the beginning.
[time=1028] And this is a big day because we now get to bring you into the loop.
[time=1032] And it's exciting and it's good.
[time=1035] And we'll be prayerful about the future of Blackhawk without us.
[time=1040] It's another exciting new thing that might conjure up all sorts of feelings in your hearts and minds.
[time=1046] But we trust that God has good plans for this church in the midst of this transition too.
[time=1052] So those are my thoughts.
[time=1055] Much more to come in the days ahead.
[time=1057] Tonya, would you come on up here real quick and just stand by Corbin?
[time=1060] Would you all stand and would you just -- we're going to do this.
[time=1063] I bet a lot of times over the next six to 12 months.
[time=1066] But would you all just stand and would you just with your heads about, extend your hands toward the millers and let me just pray for them and with them and we'll do that together as a family.
[time=1077] Our Father and Heaven, we stand here this morning so grateful for these two and for their family, for the way God that you have grown them, for the way that they have continued over the years to respond to you.
[time=1089] God, they have been doers of your Word.
[time=1092] They have allowed your Spirit and your Word and your Son and your people to grow them and move them and we're grateful that now as they continue to respond and obey your nudge, that they have had opened up to them
[time=1106] an amazing opportunity, one that we will celebrate and one that we will watch unfold in the days and weeks and months to come.
[time=1114] All Father and Heaven, we pray that you would give them great strength and wisdom.
[time=1119] God, we pray that you would give them courage for all that is ahead.
[time=1123] We're thankful for Josephia Venture.
[time=1125] Many of us here know many of them and they're good people with huge hearts and an incredible commitment to you and your Spirit and all that's going on in Eastern Europe.
[time=1136] May it be a wonderful relationship.
[time=1139] May you prepare Poland for the millers and may we rejoice in all that
[time=1146] will entail in your Son's precious good name we pray.
[time=1151] And everybody agreed and said amen.
[time=1154] Love you guys.
[time=1155] December 4th, is that the due date?
[time=1157] All right.
[time=1159] Let's just think about that.
[time=1164] Let me just say that I have walked with those two through engagement,
[time=1188] marriage, pregnancies, death, life, ministry, agreement, disagreement,
[time=1205] iron, sharpening, iron, unbelievable fruitfulness and they have only
[time=1214] and always evidenced a willingness and a readiness to learn, to grow,
[time=1220] to honor God and make much of him and I can't tell you how proud I am of them and the way that they have walked through this.
[time=1228] It is a journey that would scare many of you and me away and they have
[time=1234] walked it with great integrity and so it is why I can stand with sort of a breaking heart and also a heart filled with real appropriate pride and tell you that we believe it is a really, really good thing.
[time=1247] So I had a couple of great conversations that this week that just prompted me to write down a few notes before we jump in this morning.
[time=1255] Why do this?
[time=1256] Why spend two weeks now in the fall?
[time=1258] We will spend two weeks in the spring.
[time=1260] We do it every year.
[time=1261] Four weeks a year given to this teaching and this idea of the great biblical value and priority of spiritual formation, spiritual growth in the life of believers.
[time=1272] Why so important to us?
[time=1274] Why would we dedicate all this time and effort to this idea, this issue of spiritual growth?
[time=1279] Well, there are two things I want to say to you this morning just to kind of give you some backdrop on that.
[time=1284] There is a subjective side to the way I would answer that question.
[time=1292] And what I mean by that is that there is a sense that I have that in this culture
[time=1299] in our world today, in the face of a growing and aggressive sentiment against
[time=1305] a biblical faith, only the spiritually mature will survive.
[time=1310] I really sense this.
[time=1313] I continue to see this.
[time=1316] Only the spiritually mature will survive.
[time=1321] Only those with a deepening faith whose minds are being renewed on a daily basis.
[time=1326] Only those who are growing in spiritual knowledge and practice will be able to
[time=1332] endure with strength and experience victory.
[time=1336] I'm becoming increasingly convinced that for the immature, for the spiritually immature, it's only a matter of time until they are completely engulfed.
[time=1347] It's engulfed by both the culture of our day and their immature compromise.
[time=1353] And then in short time, they will be relegated to the spiritual bench, if you will, the sidelines, really out of the game and thus rendered ineffective, which
[time=1365] is what Satan wants.
[time=1367] You know that, right?
[time=1369] For any believer.
[time=1371] It's what Satan primarily desires.
[time=1374] He wants you to be ineffective.
[time=1377] He simply wants you and your faith, listen, to not matter.
[time=1384] If you don't matter, he's happy.
[time=1388] Most of us think he wants you immoral.
[time=1390] Most of us think, you know, he wants you and I in the headlines, having fallen off the ledge and having done some god awful thing that's just unspeakable and gross and seedy, he'll take that.
[time=1404] But really all he needs is for you to simply not matter.
[time=1409] He just needs you immature, compromised, and on the sidelines.
[time=1415] And as for his purposes, he'll be happy.
[time=1420] Subjectively, this is the sense that I get these are the things that run through my mind, then there's objective data.
[time=1429] There really is objective truth that leads us to a series like this.
[time=1433] Statistical facts that lead me to implore you and beg you and give you every
[time=1439] opportunity to grow and not die.
[time=1443] You say what kind of statistical data?
[time=1446] Well, research shows us that there seems to be a growing and alarming disconnect
[time=1452] between Christians and their growth in and understanding of God's word.
[time=1459] And the vitally important principles found within it.
[time=1463] Researchers George Barna and Jim Castelli summed it up this way.
[time=1466] Americans revere the Bible, but by and large, they don't read it.
[time=1472] And because they don't read it, they don't know it.
[time=1475] And because they don't know it, they have become a nation of biblical illiterates.
[time=1480] How bad is it?
[time=1482] You ask while research tells us that it's worse than most could imagine.
[time=1486] Fewer than half of all adults can name the four gospels.
[time=1492] Many Christians cannot identify more than two or three of the disciples.
[time=1498] Go ahead and take a stab at that real quick, just quietly in your own mind.
[time=1501] Name five. Go.
[time=1508] All right, we won't have any hands raised.
[time=1514] Multiple surveys reveal the problem in very stark terms.
[time=1517] 81% of Americans claiming to be born again Christians believe in their hearts that the phrase "God helps those who help themselves" is a Bible verse.
[time=1527] A Barna poll indicated that at least 12% of believing adults believe that Joan of Arc was Noah's wife.
[time=1536] Another survey of Christian graduating high school Christian seniors revealed that over 50% of them thought that Sodom and Gomorrah were husband and wife.
[time=1548] A considerable number of respondents to a recent Barna poll indicated that the Sermon on the Mount oftentimes referred to as the greatest sermon of all time was preached by Billy Graham.
[time=1560] True.
[time=1562] More findings from the Barna group in a recent 2010 poll
[time=1568] surveying born-again Christians across America.
[time=1572] 50% believe that the Bible is totally accurate in all of its principles.
[time=1577] 50% believed.
[time=1583] The Bible is completely and totally accurate in all that it teaches.
[time=1587] 4% of believers surveyed held to the notion that poverty is an issue
[time=1595] that is primarily the responsibility of the church.
[time=1600] 4%, so 96% feel like really we have nothing to do with the issue
[time=1607] and should move on to better things.
[time=1611] 10% believe that Moses is one of the 12 apostles.
[time=1615] Was he on your list? Be honest.
[time=1619] 34% of believing America said that they believe strongly in the notion
[time=1627] of absolute moral truth found in God's Word.
[time=1630] 34% which means 66% don't.
[time=1638] And 45% of believers surveyed said that the golden rule, the golden rule is what? Say it.
[time=1646] 45% believe the golden rule was one of the 10 commandments.
[time=1650] Consequently, here you go.
[time=1653] Consequently, more and more people today are engaged in hybrid faiths mixing elements from different historical eras and divergent theological perspectives, Barna stated.
[time=1664] In some ways he said we are creating the ultimate ecumenical movement where nothing is deemed right or wrong and all ideas, beliefs and practices are assigned equal validity.
[time=1676] Everyone is invited to join the dialogue, enjoy the ride, and feel connected to a far-reaching community of believers, biblically screening or critiquing what that community believes
[time=1689] is deemed rude and inappropriate.
[time=1693] Pragmatism and relativism, rather than any sort of absolutism,
[time=1699] as continued to gain tremendous cultural momentum.
[time=1703] By the time most Americans reach the age of 13 or 14, they think they pretty much know everything of value the Bible has to teach, and they are no longer interested in learning more scriptural content.
[time=1716] It requires increasingly concise, creative, reinforced, and personally relevant efforts to penetrate people's minds with new or more accurate insights into genuinely biblical principles.
[time=1731] In a culture driven by the desire to receive value, more Bible teaching is generally not viewed as an exercise in providing such value,
[time=1743] nor is it usually offered in a meaningful, creative, and relevant way.
[time=1751] And so whether it's the subjective sense that we have, and I believe it's an accurate subjective sense, that we are in dangerous waters in terms of culture's impact on our faith,
[time=1765] or whether it's the objective data that we can clearly see and even back up,
[time=1772] we understand there's an issue.
[time=1774] And so we take these weeks to do all that we can to teach you, to talk with you, to connect with you, to help you young and old understand the great value of growing, not staying where you are.
[time=1788] There is no neutral in this deal.
[time=1791] And we want for you nothing more than to grow, and all that Christ has provided you in your relationship with him.
[time=1799] So last week, we came to the great pain, and the great loss and the great heartache of immaturity.
[time=1809] And we looked at Hebrews 5, 12 to 14, and I want to say this before we read it together again, I want to say this about the great loss and the great pain and the heartache of immaturity.
[time=1822] And what I want to say to you is this, I am very grateful to have experienced myself
[time=1829] and to know many of you who have experienced the second, third, fourth, and fifth chances that God gives.
[time=1835] I'm grateful that when immaturity is found in me, I'm thankful that when mistakes get made, it's not the end of the ballgame.
[time=1843] I'm grateful that no matter how old you are or no matter how far you tumble,
[time=1849] God's grace and his truth and his people allow us to move forward, amen?
[time=1854] I want to say this to you though, and I really want to say this really to younger people in the room.
[time=1860] As grateful as I am for his grace and his willingness to forgive and help us move forward,
[time=1867] I do want you to understand young people, young people, 13-year-olds,
[time=1875] 12-year-olds, 14-year-olds, 15-year-olds.
[time=1880] Boy, we used to be worried about sending kids to college.
[time=1885] Now we're worried about sending kids to high school.
[time=1889] And I want to say to you, younger, young men and young women, that you're at a stage in life where you get to grow.
[time=1899] You get to keep deepening what God has given you.
[time=1903] You don't have to make choices that will alter the rest of your life.
[time=1909] Oh, make no mistake, his grace is available.
[time=1912] You end adults?
[time=1914] But a lot of adults in this room understand this, that that grace has been made available in the context of lives altered forever,
[time=1923] because of the maturity, because of choices.
[time=1928] And I'm going to beg you, young people, to listen and allow us to come alongside you
[time=1934] and help you grow so that you can at 18, 19, 20, and 21 make decisions
[time=1942] and choices that will allow you the privilege of experiencing all of his blessing.
[time=1948] All of his perfection and an easy life?
[time=1951] No, no, no, no, no.
[time=1953] But I'm just reminding you, you get to set a course at 13, 14, 15.
[time=1959] And we want you to set a course that God can honor and that you can enjoy.
[time=1964] So listen, please, all of us, and especially you younger people, what a great opportunity God has given you to be growing and not dying.
[time=1973] Hebrews 5, would you stand as a family?
[time=1975] And let me just read this to you in honor of God's word.
[time=1977] We stand, we'll read again from the NLT.
[time=1980] The writer of Hebrews says to those in his audience, "You have been believers so long now that you ought to be teaching others." Instead, you need someone to teach you again the basic things about God's word.
[time=1994] "You are like babies," he says, "who need milk and cannot eat solid food."
[time=2000] It goes on in verse 13 to say, "For someone who lives on milk is still an infant and doesn't know how to do what is, say it."
[time=2009] Right.
[time=2011] Look at verse 14, solid food is for those who are mature, who through training,
[time=2020] there you go, growing, working at it, giving yourself to the needed disciplines,
[time=2028] who through training have the skill to recognize the difference between say it and wrong.
[time=2038] Father in heaven, we pray this morning that as we continue in our study of these truths that you would open up our hearts each and every one of us, may your Holy Spirit and may your Holy Scripture do what only they can do
[time=2053] as you have your way.
[time=2054] What you began in us, God, it says in Philippians 1, you will continue, you will perfect, you will bring to maturity.
[time=2063] And God, I pray that this would be a room full of people that are willing to cooperate with you in that great endeavor in your son's name, we pray.
[time=2072] [AMEN] Well, you can have a seat in having looked last week at Hebrews 5, 12 to 14.
[time=2077] We begin to look at and name the three traits, the three traits of the spiritually immature.
[time=2084] And I want to just remind you of those first two as we move forward this morning.
[time=2089] It says there in Hebrews 5, the beginning verse 12, it talked about the fact that they should be willing to go forward, that they should be further in their faith,
[time=2102] but they'd stop listening.
[time=2103] First trait there was they don't listen.
[time=2106] Write that down if you weren't here last week.
[time=2108] The first trait of the spiritually immature is they don't listen.
[time=2114] The immature, it's like a little kid, right?
[time=2118] It's like a little baby, it's like a little toddler.
[time=2121] And you can imagine even in your mind's eye, I'm sure adults who act like little kids.
[time=2127] However it works, the immature have one thing on their mind, and that's their own agenda.
[time=2133] Immaturity is equal to one's own agenda, and they don't listen.
[time=2138] We talked about the difference between hearing and listening.
[time=2141] Hearing is taking in what's being said.
[time=2143] Listing is taking it in and doing something with it.
[time=2146] It's a cognitive response to that which has been heard.
[time=2151] And listening all throughout the Scripture, listening, taking in and responding is lifted up again
[time=2158] and again and again.
[time=2159] It's why the author of Proverbs says so many times, listen.
[time=2164] Listen to knowledge.
[time=2166] Listen to wisdom.
[time=2168] Listen to knowledge.
[time=2169] Listen to wisdom.
[time=2172] And oftentimes in Proverbs it says listen to knowledge or wisdom, it is better than fine gold.
[time=2178] Better than anything you can lay your hands on.
[time=2181] The author of Proverbs saying again and again and again.
[time=2184] Listen, listen.
[time=2186] The spiritually immature have stopped listening.
[time=2190] If it's you, you can think back to a time in recent months or years where you made this decision, you just started to shut out the inputs.
[time=2199] You stopped, you stopped allowing the inputs to come in and you stopped responding.
[time=2205] And then your life became not about responding to him, but without the inputs now it becomes about simply responding to you.
[time=2213] Spiritually immature they don't listen.
[time=2215] Number two, they don't take initiative.
[time=2218] They don't take initiative.
[time=2220] By this time he says you ought to have been what?
[time=2224] By this time you ought to have been teachers.
[time=2227] Here he raises the value of making a spiritual investment in others.
[time=2232] This pertains to anybody in the room.
[time=2235] This isn't just the educated, this pertains to anybody here today who claims to know him, who's fully surrendered your heart and life to him.
[time=2243] Part of his plan for your spiritual maturity is that you get to a point where you teach,
[time=2249] you mentor, you disciple, you come alongside others.
[time=2256] And you pass on what has been passed on to you as it relates to taking the necessary steps
[time=2262] to spiritually influencing others.
[time=2265] We see here that the spiritually immature are completely diminishing.
[time=2271] They are derailing, if you will, the plan that God gives us.
[time=2276] Look at 2 Timothy 2.
[time=2278] Go on your Bibles, everybody, just turn to 2 Timothy 2.
[time=2282] Paul is helping Timothy understand how it is and that people are to spiritually grow in the church.
[time=2290] What's this supposed to look like? How's this supposed to work?
[time=2293] Is it really some guy standing behind a pulpit?
[time=2298] And everybody gets grown?
[time=2300] No, look what he says here.
[time=2301] 2 Timothy 2, 2.
[time=2303] He says, "The things which you have heard from me," Timothy, Paul, Paul, saying to Timothy, "Timothy, the stuff you've heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust these things you've heard from me
[time=2315] to faithful men who will be able to teach others also."
[time=2322] This is how spiritual growth is defined for you and I in the New Testament.
[time=2327] This is the blueprint, the things that you have heard from me.
[time=2332] Your willingness to find faithful men, faithful women, faithful 13-year-olds who want to grow,
[time=2340] faithful 80-year-olds who still want to grow.
[time=2343] God's model for spiritual formation is you taking what you've been given
[time=2349] and passing that along to others, others who will pass it along as well,
[time=2355] and on we go toward growth and not death.
[time=2360] Three traits of the spiritually immature, they don't listen.
[time=2363] They've become dull, it says.
[time=2366] Number two, they don't take initiative.
[time=2368] And at the end, last week as we ran out of time, I told you that there was a culprit behind all this.
[time=2377] I said to you, there's a reason that this goes this way.
[time=2381] There's this thing at work in us at times which stifles spiritual maturity
[time=2388] and it really is fundamentally a part of Y.2, why we don't take the time,
[time=2396] structure our lives, make the sacrifice to invest in others.
[time=2401] And I told you I'd show you that culprit, so I want to show you how that all gets sideways.
[time=2407] 1 Corinthians 3 verses 1-3. Here you go.
[time=2412] I'm sure as I read, you'll be able to quickly identify the culprit.
[time=2418] It says in 1 Corinthians 3, 1 and I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men you wanted to.
[time=2429] He knew that was important. He knew it was needed.
[time=2433] He knew enough time had gone by where he should be able to, but he couldn't.
[time=2439] He could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of what?
[time=2444] Say it, flesh, flesh, as to infants in Christ.
[time=2451] I gave you milk to drink, not solid food for you were not yet able to receive it.
[time=2457] It should have been, but you weren't.
[time=2459] Indeed, even now, you're not able.
[time=2462] For you are still, say it, Church, out loud.
[time=2465] Fleshly, there's your culprit, the flesh.
[time=2471] For since there is interesting here, I want you to think about this.
[time=2474] He picks two words, could have picked 28.
[time=2477] He picks two words as he confronts them with their fleshliness, and isn't it interesting?
[time=2485] What do you think about those two words?
[time=2487] For since there is jealousy and strife.
[time=2494] What are jealousy and strife about?
[time=2499] I'd love to just take ten minutes and talk about it.
[time=2504] You know what jealousy is about?
[time=2507] Jealousy's about me.
[time=2509] It's about what I want and I don't have.
[time=2512] It's about what I think I deserve and I should get jealousy and strife, contention, division, control, jealousy and strife, all about me, which is what we've been saying.
[time=2524] Because again and again, he keeps connotating fleshliness, and infancy, and babies, and spiritual immaturity,
[time=2531] because it is the spiritually immature that don't think about the things God has called us to.
[time=2538] Spiritually immature just thinks about me.
[time=2542] You're fleshly, he says to them.
[time=2544] For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly?
[time=2548] And are you not walking like I love this phrase?
[time=2551] Are you not walking like mere men?
[time=2554] You know what he's saying there?
[time=2556] He's saying you're just common.
[time=2559] And I called you to be what?
[time=2562] Uncommon.
[time=2564] I called you to be holy.
[time=2566] I called you to be different.
[time=2567] I called you to be unique and distinct and you're just babies.
[time=2572] You're just infants on a bottle and you're just like everybody else.
[time=2577] There's no distinctiveness.
[time=2580] You're immature.
[time=2584] I love how that starts out.
[time=2586] It's really important that you understand this.
[time=2588] And I, brethren, verse one, could not speak to you as to spiritual men.
[time=2592] Do you know how important it is that God brings you to a point?
[time=2597] Do you understand how vital it is that you get to this place where you're able and willing to communicate with to hear and listen to Him?
[time=2605] Do you understand how meaningful it is for your growth in mind when others who God sends our way can say things to us?
[time=2614] And we can understand it and we can grasp it and we can apply it.
[time=2618] Do you get that?
[time=2619] I remember when our days at home kind of looked like this.
[time=2624] There you go.
[time=2626] Look at that.
[time=2627] In that great, we're missing one.
[time=2628] But there's the four of them.
[time=2630] And our days at home, back back in the day, used to be about dress up and little lunches and teas on the back porch and heavy with her fingers in her mouth and Jake in his bat suit.
[time=2642] He loved that bat suit when he was little.
[time=2644] He'd wear that thing all the time.
[time=2646] That's Jake up there in the bat suit.
[time=2648] He would eat in it.
[time=2650] He'd sleep in it.
[time=2651] He'd bathe in it if we let him.
[time=2654] And I looked at that picture this morning and I just thought, wow, I loved much about those days.
[time=2660] I really did.
[time=2661] But you know what?
[time=2662] Saturday, Friday, Friday.
[time=2663] This weekend, he and I, Jake's 12.
[time=2666] He's 12 now.
[time=2667] He's not wearing the bat suit anymore.
[time=2671] And we had some time in the car this weekend.
[time=2677] And we got to talk about some things.
[time=2681] He and I, we got to talk about some things that really mattered.
[time=2686] And he asked me some questions and I got to try to give him some answers and I got to ask him some questions.
[time=2692] And he kind of turned in that seat and he looked right at me and we had this amazing conversation about things that I needed to talk with him about.
[time=2700] He was receptive and God did a good thing there in those moments and we'll have more of those.
[time=2706] And I just thought, wow, that is so encouraging that we find ourselves at a time of life where I can talk to him.
[time=2714] Make sense?
[time=2716] And you, you, you need to be at a time in your life where God can talk to you.
[time=2723] Where he can say things that matter and you can listen and you can, you can get it and you can take steps.
[time=2731] And yet if you're back here with your bottle and your milk and your immaturity and your flesh, it's just a, it's a messy deal.
[time=2742] And there comes a day when it stops being cute.
[time=2746] And it really gets destructive and ugly and hard.
[time=2751] Well, I told you there was a culprit. There it is right there in verse three.
[time=2754] I want to just say it to you.
[time=2755] I want you to write it down.
[time=2756] I want you to think about it this morning.
[time=2758] Why no initiative?
[time=2762] We're back to our second point.
[time=2764] Why no initiative taken with others in terms of spiritual investment?
[time=2769] Why might you continue to live in such spiritual immaturity?
[time=2773] Because the text says, and I know it's true of you at times and you know it's true of me at times because you're too discreet.
[time=2780] Because you're too distracted by, you're still attracted to, you're still governed more by your flesh than the Holy Spirit of God.
[time=2793] And when you're truly more governed or controlled by your fleshly desires, and if we did a biblical study of fleshly desires, here's the four points we'd end up with.
[time=2804] I want to just give them to you right now so you can think about it.
[time=2807] When you're controlled by what feels good, think about it.
[time=2813] When you're more governed by what looks good.
[time=2817] When you're governed or controlled by what gets you attention.
[time=2822] When you're more controlled by what feeds your appetites, and I don't just mean burgers.
[time=2831] When you're more governed by your appetites, when you're more governed by you looking good, you getting attention, what feels good, these are the fleshly desires.
[time=2842] And when this is what controls you, then your energy for spiritual opportunities simply and always and only fades.
[time=2853] Just goes away, and it becomes a non-issue, and spiritually you become a non-issue, and he's got you right where he wants you.
[time=2863] Initiative taken to do something spiritually with others, directly connected, 1 Corinthians 3 to our flesh.
[time=2873] That's why Samson faded, that's why Judas faded, that's why David faded, drawn more to pleasure than principle.
[time=2885] And is it a heart issue? Certainly.
[time=2888] And I want to just say this to you practically. Is it a heart issue? Most certainly.
[time=2893] But it is also just a time issue. And what I mean by that is, in other words, when making a spiritual investment in others is 11th on your list, guess what?
[time=2910] You go ahead and make your list right now in your mind of the most important things in your life, I'll make mine.
[time=2918] Make a list of the things that matter the most that you think are most important and deserve the most attention.
[time=2924] And I guarantee you, I don't care who you are, I don't care how you're wired, you might get to 1 through 4.
[time=2934] We've got about enough time in our days to maybe get to 4. You're not going to get to 11th.
[time=2944] And so unless this somehow is a priority that finds its way to the top, and I believe it should be in God's word, calls it to be, it's not going to happen.
[time=2955] It's not going to happen. And it doesn't get raised to the top because of this culprit, the flesh, jealousy, strife, and a number of other things that are all about you.
[time=2966] Number three, third trademark of the spiritually mature, they can't, we've seen it in the text, they cannot discern good from evil.
[time=2975] They cannot discern good from evil. Think about all the seasons of immaturity in your life, and think about, just for a moment, some of the choices that you made.
[time=2987] The spiritually immature cannot discern good from evil. Verse 14, I love how the text reads. If you see it there, Hebrews 5, 14.
[time=2996] So solid food is for those who are mature, who through training have the skill to recognize the difference between right and wrong.
[time=3007] What a huge skill that is. Oh, if I could give you a skill, it would be that.
[time=3016] Oh, if you and I could be trained and grown and matured in a skill, the skill to recognize the difference, to recognize the difference in impact, to recognize the difference in consequence, to recognize the difference in bringing honor or shame to the name of the Lord.
[time=3035] To recognize the difference between right and wrong.
[time=3041] And it's only possible, verse says it, for the mature.
[time=3048] Think about it, only the spiritually mature people can navigate temptation.
[time=3056] Immature people don't navigate temptation. Only the spiritually mature can discern between good healthy choices, and that which is foolish.
[time=3067] Only the spiritually mature people can order their lives with the proper and spiritually appropriate amounts of accountability and wisdom.
[time=3078] Immature people fall to temptation. Immature people find themselves in the snare of folly. Immature people try to go it alone.
[time=3090] A toddler doesn't know the oven is hot, and they get scorched, because they're immature.
[time=3102] I love how the Apostle Paul says it in 1 Corinthians 14. He just flat out, says it. You can turn there, or it'll be on the screen there.
[time=3110] Brethren, do not be children in your thinking. You see where this begins, right? Certainly we're talking about maturity in choices and actions.
[time=3119] But you know, many of you by now, that the choices and actions begin in your where? In your mind, and here he implores the Corinthians not to be children in your thinking.
[time=3130] Yet in evil, be infants there. He connects again, infancy and babies and milk with the schemes of the devil and the evil that comes.
[time=3140] But in your thinking, he says, be mature. In Ephesians 4, I want you to see this as we draw to a close this morning.
[time=3149] Look at Ephesians 4. Would encourage you to write this passage down. Would encourage you to turn there this morning.
[time=3157] I want you to see the imagery. I want you to understand the great import of these words, Ephesians 4, 14.
[time=3167] As a result, we are no longer, and I want you to note as a result, this has to do with what comes before Ephesians 4, 14.
[time=3177] And what comes before Ephesians 4, 14 is this unbelievable treatment, this description and this articulation of your faith in Christ.
[time=3187] All the way up to this point, it's about the great benefits of salvation and all that it entails.
[time=3193] And so then he says, as a result, we are no longer to be children tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine,
[time=3206] by the trickery of men, just real quick in your minds, just think back to.
[time=3211] Or even today, if you've got little ones in your world, think how easy it is to trick them.
[time=3217] Think how easy it is to get them going down one road and then yank them back to this one.
[time=3223] Think how moldable they are. Think how they just kind of meander here and can meander there because they don't know any better.
[time=3231] We talked about it last week, no longer carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men.
[time=3238] Here's the most important one, "By craftiness and deceitful scheming." Who's doing that? That's the enemy.
[time=3246] No more of that. But speaking the truth and love, we are to what? Say it, church out loud.
[time=3253] Grow up. We are to grow up in all aspects into him who is the head, even Christ.
[time=3262] Grow up in all aspects in every, listen, in every part of your life.
[time=3270] As a wife, as a husband, as a son or daughter, as a young believer, as an older believer,
[time=3278] in every aspect of your life at work, at home, in public or in what? Private.
[time=3287] In every single aspect of who you are, he says it is time for you to grow up.
[time=3295] Would you stand and let's worship together?
[time=3308] I've only learned to live, have it all, my heart is yours.
[time=3333] I'll send you as a seal upon my heart, as a seal upon my heart.
[time=3347] For there is love that is as strong as death, just as sea demanding as the grave.
[time=3359] And many waters cannot quench this love.
[time=3371] I've learned to live, have it all, my heart is yours.
[time=3393] I'll send you as a seal upon my heart, as a seal upon my heart.
[time=3407] For there is love that is as strong as death, just as sea demanding as the grave.
[time=3419] And many waters cannot quench this love.
[time=3431] I've learned to live, have it all.
