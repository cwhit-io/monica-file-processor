[time=638] Before we open the Word of God together to learn today, would you take a minute?
[time=643] Just bow your heads and quietly in the presence of the Lord.
[time=648] Just offer your prayers of adoration and thanks and glory and honor.
[time=655] [MUSIC - 86 seconds]
[time=765] I also ask this morning, God, that you would help us to not just hear your word today, but to do it.
[time=772] And may that be a sweet offering of worship to you as we obey you.
[time=777] In Jesus' name I pray.
[time=779] [AMEN] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
