[time=61] Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=63] It's great to have you with us.
[time=65] It always is for those of you that are a regular part of our Bible hour viewing audience.
[time=71] We mean that.
[time=72] We're thankful for each and every day we get to spend with you thankful we get the chance to bring God's word to you hopefully in a relevant and meaningful way.
[time=81] And as we find ourselves moving forward in this study of the book of James, I can't think of a more relevant and meaningful study for you and for me.
[time=91] This is a study, a book of the Bible, James that speaks to the everyday real issues of life and it gives you and it gives me a chance together to better understand the ways in which God has called us to respond, the way He's called us to live, the choices He wants us to make.
[time=108] It's all right here in James and I hope that you're enjoying this study.
[time=113] I want to invite you to join me and hundreds of people here at Blackhawk who I know are doing this.
[time=118] We're reading the book of James every week.
[time=121] That's right.
[time=122] Enjoying the Sunday study, but also every day of the week we're committing to read a chapter a day.
[time=128] And I hope you'll do that.
[time=129] I hope you'll take time in the morning or midday or even at night alone or with your family or with your wife, your spouse, your friend, your small group.
[time=136] However you want to do it, we're asking you to read a chapter a day that gets you through the whole book in a week or less.
[time=143] And we can't wait to see what God's going to do with the book of James kind of being instilled in us day by day as the weeks go by.
[time=151] It's going to be a great, great study.
[time=153] Also, as I sit here and take this, I can hear them warming up in the worship center.
[time=158] The vocalists are there.
[time=160] The band is there.
[time=161] And it reminds me of what a special experience it is here on Sunday mornings.
[time=165] And for some of you, I know you don't have a place to gather.
[time=169] You love the Lord.
[time=171] You love joining us via the broadcast.
[time=174] But I want to just encourage you to come.
[time=176] Get up and come be with us on Sunday mornings at 9 or 1045.
[time=180] We would love to have you with us and we'd love to meet you.
[time=184] Get to know you, understand your story better and help you find ways to meaningfully connect with this family here at Blackhawk.
[time=191] Hey, I'm glad you're tuning in today.
[time=193] God bless you.
[time=194] Thank you so much for being a part of our family.
[time=197] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=200] God bless.
[time=230] [MUSIC - 269 seconds]
[time=514] (audience applauds) [MUSIC - 44 seconds]
[time=570] It is where, with my soul, it is where, it is where, with my soul.
[time=600] I said, "Oh, the bliss of this glorious thought."
[time=611] I said, "Not in part but the whole."
[time=623] It's nailed to the force, and I bear in no more.
[time=634] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, oh my soul.
[time=646] It is where, with my soul, it is where, it is where, with my soul.
[time=671] It is where, with my soul.
[time=690] Praise the day when my faith shall be said.
[time=699] The clouds be rolled back as a scroll.
[time=710] Oh, the trowel shall return, and the road shall be sent.
[time=722] Even so, it is where, with my soul, it is where, with my soul.
[time=737] With my soul, it is where, with my soul.
[time=764] God, may you be praised today in our midst.
[time=768] May our souls magnify you and adore you in this place today.
[time=773] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=777] Thanks for singing that out. You may be seated.
[time=794] Light in the darkness. Peace for my soul.
[time=818] You are my rescue. You've never let go.
[time=830] You're light in the darkness. Peace for my soul.
[time=842] You are my rescue. You've never let go.
[time=855] All my hope is in you. All my strength is in you with every breath.
[time=870] My soul will rest in you.
[time=878] Here in my weakness, always the same.
[time=890] Your love is my shelter. Your life is my way.
[time=904] All my hope is in you. All my strength is in you with every breath.
[time=918] My soul will rest in you. All my hope is in you. All my strength is in you with every breath.
[time=942] My soul will rest in you.
[time=951] Come, stand, save your prayer forever. Lord, you have my heart.
[time=976] You have my heart.
[time=1000] Lord, stand, save your prayer forever. Lord, you have my heart.
[time=1024] You have my heart.
[time=1049] My hope is in you. All my strength is in you with every breath.
[time=1063] My soul will rest in you. All the earth beneath you.
[time=1078] All my life before you with every breath. My soul will rest in you.
[time=1092] With every breath, my soul will rest in you.
[time=1114] Thanks, Corbin. Thank you, Tonya, and the band for a great morning of worship.
[time=1118] Would you all thank them for what they brought to us this morning?
[time=1121] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1126] Hey, I want to thank Josh Ring for the job he did last week as he started us off on our study of the book of James.
[time=1132] It's a unique study. It's an overview study, five weeks, a chapter a week, and I'm grateful for the many of you who I know.
[time=1140] I've talked with you, you've emailed, you've contacted us to let us know that you're reading along with us.
[time=1146] I ask you to read as a family a chapter a day, get you through the whole book in a week.
[time=1151] And hundreds of you are doing that. I hope hundreds more of you will do that in the days to come join us.
[time=1157] Would you really? A chapter a day in the book of James. Read it, and as you read it, you'll see what many of us are seeing.
[time=1163] The practical truth it gives to the everyday issues of life. It's a great read. It's an easy read, and I hope you'll join us in the days to come.
[time=1171] We come this morning in our Sunday morning study of chapter two. And you can open your Bibles there if you'd like to at this point.
[time=1178] And as we come to chapter two, I've asked Rod Ovid to come and be with us just for a few minutes this morning.
[time=1183] This is a little segment that we'll just call resource. And resource is going to be a segment periodically.
[time=1189] Rod will come to do what Rod and Carolyn both do so well. Rod and Carolyn founded, along with my help and Blackhawk support,
[time=1196] Lagos Institute of Biblical Studies. And whenever I come up in my studies, whenever I come up against a historical issue,
[time=1205] a doctrinal issue, a contextual, that's the word used for the text. And there's interpretation that you know is involved in teaching.
[time=1215] And when I come up against those things oftentimes, Rod is the guy that I go to. Rod is the one who gives me insight and reminders.
[time=1222] And I'm thankful this morning I've asked him to come because in James 2, we come to this issue halfway through the chapter of this age-old debate.
[time=1232] It's kind of an age-old controversy. There seems to be in the book of James this issue of faith and works.
[time=1240] Paul, many of you know, talking about through the epistles, faith alone saves. And then you come to James and it would appear to some that maybe James is starting
[time=1251] to get into this idea of faith by works. And so which is it? Is our faith, faith alone or is it a faith achieved by works?
[time=1261] So Rod and I have had some great discussions about it. Rod, I'll tell them some of the things that come to your mind and come to your heart as you think about this issue that we see in James 2.
[time=1270] Very good. Thank you, Kelly. I think we'd all agree that the foundational issue of our faith is that salvation is freely given by God.
[time=1279] Wouldn't we agree with that? It's freely given. It's not by works. And of course we have a fundamental foundational verse that Paul wrote that most of us know by heart.
[time=1292] And we read that in Ephesians 2, 8, and 9. And basically it says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith.
[time=1301] Not of yourselves. It is the gift of God. Not as a result of works so that no one may boast." And he talks about this often. He talks about this salvation freely given and you accept Christ as Savior.
[time=1314] Again in Romans 3.28, "For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works." Now, Kelly has the opportunity to look at James 2 today.
[time=1326] And there are some verses there that cause one to scratch your head a little bit. Because James says in 2.17, "Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead being by itself."
[time=1339] And he says, "You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone." And one has to ask oneself what's he saying.
[time=1348] Now, the danger we all run into is when we just take a verse right there on the page and we run with it.
[time=1355] A lot of times we have to slow down and get the context. We have to understand what's going on. Now Paul had a problem. He complained about this.
[time=1363] There was an issue and it happened back in Galatia. And you can see here on the screen, he complained about it in Galatians 1, 6, and 7.
[time=1372] I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ for a different gospel, which is really not another.
[time=1382] Only there are some of you that are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel.
[time=1388] And the disturbing there is that folks were coming into Galatia. Paul was hearing they were beginning to promote this idea of works of righteousness.
[time=1397] Exactly. And he talks about it in chapter 2 and he actually tells what's happening. When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned.
[time=1409] For prior to the coming of certain men from James, he used to eat with Gentiles, but when they came, he began to withdraw and hold himself aloof on and on.
[time=1421] Now, there are scholars that really think there was a conflict here, but we're not done. There's a map I want to show you.
[time=1428] By the way, this is my favorite map of the New Testament. Mainly because it shows all those orange squiggles are Roman roads, so you can trace.
[time=1438] Did you know Paul walked 10,000 miles during his life? 10,000 miles. Yeah. So a lot of walking. Anyway, what you have here is Jerusalem that we all know.
[time=1448] And we know that Italy is here in Rome. Well, up along here, here's Egypt. Up here is where they were first called Christians in Antioch.
[time=1457] And then this whole area here was called the Near East. The Romans called it Pro Counselor East because they took it over.
[time=1465] Here's Ephesus on the water. But right here is Galatia. Now, when the Jews scattered, and we see Peter talks to scattered Jews, James writes to scattered Jews.
[time=1475] This is what we call the diaspora. This is when they were scattered. It goes all the way back to Babylon and other times.
[time=1482] And the Jews, 11% of the world was Jewish at that time. Now, they were scattered all over. And here they would pick up, and we would call it, they would synchronize.
[time=1493] Synchronistic, they would synchronize with other religions, their Jewish faith. And so in this area, in Galatia, there were two gods that they had.
[time=1502] One was called Hasios, which basically means holy. The other one was Decayos, which means righteousness. And they pictured it with a scale.
[time=1513] And they said that you had to live holy. You had to live a certain way to balance the scales. If you didn't, it cost you.
[time=1522] And in that area, in Galatia, we have documents where people lapped off their arms, lapped off their feet, cut off their hands, plucked out an eye, did all kinds of things to their body where they could please their God.
[time=1537] Paul comes in and says, what are you talking about? Salvation is free. It doesn't cost you. Now, imagine his disdain when Judaizers come up and say,
[time=1550] oh, no, there is a piece of flesh. You need to be circumcised. You need to do this. And they said, well, we'll happily do that. Paul was mad.
[time=1560] So they called the council. In 50 AD, it was called the Jerusalem Council. And they all got together. They all went to Jerusalem.
[time=1569] And James was there. Paul and Barnabas, they all went there and they confronted the issue. Well, James says something very interesting. He writes it down and he basically says this.
[time=1580] Since we have heard that some of our number to whom we gave no instruction have disturbed you with their words, unsettling your souls, it seemed good to us having become of one mind to select men and anyway, he goes on.
[time=1596] That dispels the controversy right there. Earlier, Paul's thinking, folks came from James. And James here says at the council, no, nobody came from us.
[time=1606] We didn't give these guys who came and started doing this works thing. We gave them no instruction to go and preach.
[time=1612] Right, very good. And so basically what it comes down to in the Greek in like a lot of language, when you go to translate and you go to read it, you have to translate it in context and take a lot of things into consideration.
[time=1624] You just don't look at the word. And so basically you go all the way back to the beginning and Ephesians where Paul is saying for by grace, you have been saved not of works. When he says works there, he's saying you should do deeds.
[time=1636] He says it right here in the next screen we're going to see. We'll see how they agree basically. He says, you keep the deeds, but just don't do the ritualistic works for salvation.
[time=1646] Look at here. For it is not the hearers of the law who are just before God, but the doers of the law will be justified. And see, so Paul's saying a lot of things that James does.
[time=1657] And you just have to take one step at a time and study it. Very good. Awesome. Thank you very much. Thank Rod for being with us this morning, would you?
[time=1664] And don't forget, Wednesday nights, anybody in the room, anybody here, welcome to be a part of the Lagos Institute of Biblical Studies, Wednesday, 6 o'clock and 732 classes a week right now Rod, Carolyn, you guys are doing what two classes?
[time=1679] Which two?
[time=1681] Let's see, we're doing the doctrine and theology first hour and minor prophets.
[time=1687] Doctrine and theology first hour, minor prophets second hour. And again, you're all welcome to come five bucks a class, a great price and enormously spiritually important experience.
[time=1698] And I hope you'll go and take part in it. Okay, James 2, here we go overview. So it's going to be quick, but we want to make sure we give you some things to chew on, some things to hold on to today as you leave.
[time=1708] Let's begin, if you would open your Bibles to James 2 verses 1 to 4, we're also going to read verse 9 and verse 13. Here's the first half of James 2.
[time=1719] "My brethren," he says, "do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism.
[time=1730] For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes."
[time=1739] So you get two guys coming at the same time, one looks good and one looks bad, and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes, and you say to him, you sit here in a good place, and you say to the poor man, you stand over there or sit down by my footstool.
[time=1756] Have you not made, say that word church, out loud, distinctions? Have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil motives?
[time=1770] My friends, in all my days of truly knowing the Lord and watching him do his divine, redeeming, life-changing work all over the world, I've had the privilege.
[time=1782] I really have had the honor of seeing him do his life-changing, redeeming work all over the world.
[time=1789] I've watched him redeem lives here in Fort Wayne. I've seen him change and transform people in Southern California.
[time=1797] I've watched him take an eternally altered people in Ivanovo, in the Vladimir region of Russia.
[time=1804] I've seen him rescue and bring life and hope to those in Nairobi, Kenya.
[time=1810] I've watched God over the years do this again and again, and not one single time.
[time=1816] Have I ever seen God withhold his mercy or withhold his grace, withhold his kindness, his forgiveness, or his salvation from someone because they were weird?
[time=1830] Because they smelled, because they were awkward, because they were different.
[time=1840] Never have I seen him withhold his grace or his love because they were dark-skinned or light-skinned, blue-collar, white-collar, unemployed, or a CEO.
[time=1852] And I might add even this morning, neither have I seen him withhold his grace from anybody in a political party.
[time=1862] I've watched him save a nun and I've watched him transform a murderer.
[time=1871] What this first passage in James 2 is saying is this, two things.
[time=1875] Number one, there should be no distinctions. I hope you'll write this down.
[time=1878] There should be no distinctions made at all within the family of the local church.
[time=1887] And that's just not talking to me in the way I treat people. No, this is talking to you.
[time=1894] This is talking to all of us who name the name of Christ within the local church, within the body of Christ and the family of God.
[time=1901] There should be no distinctions made at all in the way that we treat people.
[time=1905] The people of God, in fact, I would suggest to you this morning, the people of God should be the most accepting, the most gracious,
[time=1912] the kindest people of them all because of the fact that God was so gracious in his acceptance of you.
[time=1921] You should be the most accepting person on the planet because you above all else know what it's like to be accepted.
[time=1928] You know what it's like to have smelled. You know what it's like to have been awkward and distant in his sight.
[time=1937] You know what it's like to have not deserved the grace and the love and the forgiveness and the hope that he so freely gave you.
[time=1947] We should be of all people, the most gracious.
[time=1954] Don't forget what it says in Romans 3.
[time=1957] Romans 3 gives us something that we should always remember when it comes to how gracious he was and the state in which he found us.
[time=1968] I believe it will be on the screen. Look at Romans 3, I'm going to pick it up in verse 9, just a clear, unedited commentary on our humanness.
[time=1980] It says in 3.9, "What then are we better than they?"
[time=1986] Are we better than they not at all?
[time=1988] For we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin, as it is written there is none righteous, not even one.
[time=1995] You know that's true, right church? Not one righteous, not one deserving.
[time=2001] There is none who understands. There is none who seeks for God.
[time=2005] All have turned aside together. They have become useless.
[time=2008] There is none who does good. There is not even one.
[time=2012] Their throat is an open grave with their tongues they keep deceiving.
[time=2017] The reason of asks is under their lips, whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness, their feet are swift to shed blood.
[time=2025] Destruction and misery are in their paths and the path of peace they have not known.
[time=2031] There is no fear of God. It says there in verse 18, "There is no fear of God before their eyes."
[time=2039] So that's how you were. That's how I was. It's the state of man outside or separated from the acceptance and the grace and the life-changing love of God.
[time=2051] The people of God should be the most accepting people of them all.
[time=2055] The first part of James 2 is that too often the distinction that does get made is preference toward the haves and neglect of the have-nots.
[time=2069] Preference evidenced toward the haves and neglect of the have-nots.
[time=2075] In some places in some church settings, sad but true, if you have influence, if you have money, if you have wealth, in some places in some church settings, if you have a spouse, in other words, if you're not single, if you have a name, if you have a personality, if you have an overt gift or talent, then you're in.
[time=2097] Some sit in the front is what some of those places say in the way that they treat those people. There are distinctions made, and those people tend to be treated, and those people tend to be viewed as special and uniquely important.
[time=2115] And if you don't have those things, if you don't have wealth, and if you don't have talent, and if you don't have personality, in some places it's like, "Who are you?"
[time=2126] Get out of our way. Sit in the back.
[time=2132] That's why at Black Hawk we try to. I try to remember everyone's name. It's why everyone gets a hug. It's why everyone gets a handshake or a personal quick prayer or an appointment on Thursday.
[time=2147] There's days are appointment days, and if you've got a need or you want to talk, we sit and meet with you and encourage you and listen.
[time=2154] It's why there's no privileged parking places. It's why my assistant schedule special lunches in my office with widows.
[time=2162] It's why you can wear anything you want to church. You can wear a $500 suit. You can wear a bathing suit with a T-shirt and flip-flops.
[time=2173] That would be for guys. I'll clarify that.
[time=2178] It's why anyone looking for a country club feel, and a church never lands here, because we're trying to honor James 2.
[time=2189] No distinctions. Say that with me. No distinctions.
[time=2196] We are no respecter of persons when it comes to the giving out of kindness. You understand that, right? That is our desire. That is our intent.
[time=2203] We don't always do it perfectly, but we are no respecter of persons. When it comes to the giving out of kindness, and please don't miss this, we are no respecter of persons when it comes to confronting what needs to be confronted.
[time=2214] You might be really, really wealthy, but if you're not honoring God and if you're disobeying Him and if your attitude's bad, I'll get in your grill.
[time=2225] If you're poor and your attitude's bad, we'll get in your face lovingly with the Word of God and the Spirit of God and an invitation to make things right.
[time=2233] See, it doesn't matter who you are, and it doesn't matter who you know, and it doesn't matter how much you make.
[time=2238] It doesn't matter where your vacation doesn't matter what you drive, because we're trying to be about more than those things.
[time=2245] We're trying to be about a family, and you all know families are different.
[time=2250] And within that difference, we get a chance to stay consistent on the things that matter most.
[time=2256] No partiality. No partiality. Let me read to you. You don't have to turn there. I'm going to just read to you.
[time=2263] It's quick, but I just love how it sums it up. It says in Romans chapter 2, 11, Romans chapter 2 verse 11 says,
[time=2273] "For there is no partiality with God." None. And so there should be none with you.
[time=2283] And as we come to the end of that first section there, my question for you this week, sometimes I give you five or six things to do.
[time=2291] I'm going to ask you to come up with the three or four things. I'm going to ask you to come up this week with one thing.
[time=2298] Stretch yourself. Maybe two things that give you a chance to do what James says you should do.
[time=2304] James says that we should not just be hearers of the last ten minutes, but James says that you should be what?
[time=2310] You should be doers of the last ten minutes. So from these last ten minutes, what will you do this week?
[time=2317] How will you show no partiality at home with the kids? How will you show no distinctions as you walk into your workplace?
[time=2326] How will you be a believer, a true believer who lives out a faith that's based on a God who's against any kind of distinctions being made?
[time=2336] Who's accepting and loving and gracious and kind to whoever might need it no matter who they are, what they've done, what they look like, where they're from?
[time=2348] So I wonder if you would have it within you in the minutes or hours to come, maybe even before this day ends, would you individually or would you with your family, would you with your small group?
[time=2362] Consider how this week will you be a doer of his word when it comes to not showing favoritism to anybody?
[time=2372] I hope you'll think about that. I hope you'll consider that.
[time=2376] All right, let's go to the second part of the chapter in our overview study here of James 2.
[time=2383] And I want to start by simply reading to you what it says in James 2.14, more to get to, but let me start just by having you look at this.
[time=2394] It says what uses it, verse 14, and he's asking, what use is it my brethren?
[time=2401] If someone says he has faith but has no works, can that faith save him?
[time=2412] And you don't have to raise your hand and you don't have to answer it out loud, but I'm asking you that question.
[time=2417] As you think about this initially here this morning, as you hear that question, see that question being asked in the text, what do you think about that?
[time=2425] Can a faith, a state, a verbally stated faith with no works, can that faith save someone? Is that a saving faith?
[time=2441] Well, the age-old truth that James addresses here, and we'll read it here in the verses to come, but I want to just give this to you up front.
[time=2449] It's so profound. It's so powerful. It's so important that you and I think this through.
[time=2454] The age-old truth that James addresses here, the same truth that Scripture communicates in other places again and again and again is this.
[time=2462] And please don't miss this. What you do reveals who you are.
[time=2471] Wow. What you do, the choices that you make, the pattern of your life, that which is characteristic of you, the things you do, the places you go, the stuff you think, the patterns of your life,
[time=2498] what you do reveals who you are. Not your intentions, not your promises, not your words, your choices.
[time=2517] Reveal that which is true about the very deepest parts of you. You can say with this passage in mind, you can say you love God, you can say you follow God, you can say you honor God.
[time=2534] But if, and please hear this, but if as a consistent pattern, we're not talking about every once in a while slip ups that aren't characteristic of you at all.
[time=2545] But if as a consistent pattern, day after day, week after week, month after month, with a somewhat or mostly a hard heart that sort of says, you know what, it's no big deal.
[time=2559] If with a consistent pattern and a hard heart, if you don't act like it, then it's not you.
[time=2569] You can say it's you till you're blue in the face, you can say you love him, you can say you follow him, but if as a consistent pattern and with a hard heart, you don't, then you're not.
[time=2585] Verse 15, here's just what we love about James, how practical he gets, he just brings it into the everyday of our life. If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, and one of you who has claimed verbally, I'm in, says to them, go in peace, in other words, get lost.
[time=2609] Go in peace, be warmed and be filled, and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body if there is no work.
[time=2623] What use is that?
[time=2626] Is that of any use for that person in need?
[time=2629] Yes or no? No, even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.
[time=2637] But someone may well say, you have faith and I have works. Show me your faith without the works, and I believe this is James speaking here where it says, but someone may well say, I believe that's James saying, I may well say, you have faith and I have works, show me your faith without the works, I'll show you my faith by my works.
[time=2655] And he goes on here, it's like he's saying, let me explain this to you, you believe that God is one, you've got faith in God?
[time=2664] He says, you do well, the demons believe that.
[time=2669] The demons also believe that and shudder, but are you willing to recognize you foolish fellow that faith without works is useless, was not Abraham, our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
[time=2686] You see that faith, which was already there, was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected or faith was validated.
[time=2699] It wasn't the offering of Isaac that saved him, he offered Isaac because he was what? Saved.
[time=2709] He's just showing you who he is, because what you do reveals who you what, say who you are, who you are.
[time=2721] You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works he was perfected, and the scripture was fulfilled, which says, and Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness, and he was called the friend of God.
[time=2733] You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.
[time=2739] In the same way, verse 25, was not Rahab the harlot. Oh, what a great story this is, that she gives a place of covering and escape for the spies who came into Jericho, was Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way.
[time=2758] For just as the body without the spirit is what, say it, dead, so also faith without works is what, say it again, dead.
[time=2771] Rahab did such a great job this morning of giving you some background on this issue, and while some may try to make it controversial, let me suggest to you that it's actually very logical.
[time=2784] It's actually very clear, it's stated often in the scriptures, it's not really difficult at all to understand, and I'll just give it to you in a brief little shot here.
[time=2795] Hopefully, again, you can write this down, hang on to this, hold on to this in the days to come, good, obedient, God-honoring works, don't save you.
[time=2805] Saved people do good, obedient, God-honoring works.
[time=2814] And it's worth repeating again, it has nothing to do with intentions, it has only to do with the pattern of your life, and Jesus himself couldn't have been any clearer.
[time=2825] And here's the NLT again, love in the NLT, look how it says it in Matthew 7, 18, a good tree can't produce bad fruit.
[time=2838] And with a tree, we can even be more dogmatic, and a bad tree can't produce good fruit.
[time=2846] What I mean by we can be even more dogmatic, a good tree can't ever, a good tree cannot, in any circumstance, a good tree can't produce, you don't get figs on apple trees.
[time=2858] On apple trees you get apples, that's it, who you, what you do, reveals who you are, and you're either a good tree or a bad tree, and if we want to figure out which one we are, which one you are, we simply look at your fruit.
[time=2880] Because there's no ambiguity there, none at all.
[time=2887] And theologically, or doctrinally, for those of you who like to think a little deeper on these issues, on the Paul James thing, which I think is a very valid thing to consider.
[time=2899] Again, Rod has been helpful for me in my own thinking as I look at the two of them.
[time=2904] On the Paul and James thing, the way I like to say it, and the way I was taught to say it would be this, and you can just jot this down if you'd like, I even have stick figures drawn here on my notes.
[time=2916] I've got these two stick figures, Paul and James, and I want you to understand that as you read their writings in the New Testament, they are not facing off.
[time=2926] They are not coming at each other. No, the way you draw the stick figures is that really they're back-to-back.
[time=2933] Paul and James are on the same team, and they're standing back-to-back together fighting two very serious enemies of true salvation.
[time=2943] Did you know that salvation has enemies?
[time=2948] There are two very serious enemies of salvation, and Paul and James are together back-to-back with their weapons, their sword, their truth helped tightly, and they're going to battle against these enemies.
[time=2963] Paul is defending against the enemy of legalism. Paul is defending against legalistic rulekeepers who think they can earn salvation.
[time=2975] And that's why you hear Paul again and again say we are saved by grace through faith, nothing else.
[time=2985] By grace through faith, Paul continues repeatedly in his writings to promote this, to communicate this, legalism, rulekeepers who think they can earn salvation.
[time=2996] James, back-to-back with Paul, he's fighting against opportunistic fire insurance frauds, really is what it amounts to.
[time=3006] People who try and strip works from the discussion.
[time=3012] People who try to make and still try to make salvation only about words, only about the walk down the aisle to the altar instead of making it about the faith that gets lived out after the walk down the aisle and the altar.
[time=3029] I found this this week. I want to read it to you. I think there's a copy of it that'll come on the screen. Thomas Brooks said it. It's not in my language, as you can tell, but I kind of found a way to kind of just get through it.
[time=3044] And as I got through it, I realized, wow, this is really, really good. Christ hath freed you, Thomas Brooks said, 17th century English preacher.
[time=3054] Christ hath freed you from all your enemies, from the curse of the law, the predominant, damnatory power of sin, the wrath of God, the sting of death, and the torments of hell.
[time=3066] But what is the end and design of Christ in doing these great and marvelous things for His people?
[time=3073] It is not that we should throw off duties of righteousness and holiness, but that their hearts may be the more free and sweet in all holy duties and heavenly services.
[time=3087] Oh souls, I know no such arguments to work you to a lively and constant performance of all heavenly services works like those that are drawn from the consideration that you and I would make of the great and glorious things that Christ hath done for you.
[time=3118] Follow along on your notes, fill this in as we close our time this morning, here in this passage, this second passage of James 2.
[time=3128] James provides us with the three traits of a dead and worthless faith.
[time=3136] It sounds a little dark, I know it sounds a little dismal, but it's important that all of you would understand this.
[time=3143] There are characteristics of a faith that doesn't save, and here are three of those characteristics.
[time=3150] It starts with an empty confession.
[time=3152] We've seen this verse 14.
[time=3154] It says there, what uses it?
[time=3156] He gives you where he's going right there.
[time=3158] What uses it?
[time=3159] If someone says, if someone proclaims, if someone talks a lot about their salvation, if they say, if they speak, if they proclaim it, if they are always talking about it.
[time=3176] What good is that if someone says he has faith but has no works, can that faith save him?
[time=3183] I asked you that at the beginning, your answer to that today would be what?
[time=3187] Say it.
[time=3188] Probably not, no.
[time=3190] The point James makes here is simply this.
[time=3192] Listen, talk is, say it.
[time=3196] Cheap.
[time=3198] Talk's always cheap.
[time=3200] On the spiritual front, talk is all caps.
[time=3205] Talk is cheap.
[time=3207] It's not about talk.
[time=3209] James makes it simple and powerful.
[time=3212] Talk is cheap, and he says that a personal proclamation of faith, no matter how loud or eloquently or often you say it, is empty and useless unless it's validated Abraham Isaac.
[time=3227] Validated, shown to be real by your good deeds, consistent, ongoing week by week, month by month, year after year in your life, we see the pattern going more and more in that direction.
[time=3244] An empty confession, trait number one of a worthless faith, a dead faith.
[time=3251] Number two, a worthless faith is exposed as well by a false compassion.
[time=3257] I hope you'll write that down.
[time=3259] We saw that in verses 15 and 17.
[time=3264] Okay, if somebody's hungry, if somebody's cold, if somebody's thirsty, and you say, oh, I feel for you.
[time=3273] Oh, that's a horrible circumstance.
[time=3276] If there is this sense of compassion that's not followed up by a willingness in you to give him a coat, then your compassion is false and your faith is dead.
[time=3289] It's a worthless faith that turns its head, and most importantly, its heart, from a choice it could make, from a need it could most certainly meet.
[time=3300] A biblical, Christ-imitating faith is compassionate, it's sacrificial, it's kind, it's generous, and yes, it's sacrificial and kind and generous as the body of Blackhawk moves toward December
[time=3317] and gifts that go, and this idea of above and beyond your normal giving, and then another amount that is accumulated as you rethink how you do gifts,
[time=3328] and maybe there's families who don't do gifts this year, and they take all that money and they add that to the above and beyond amount,
[time=3336] and it all gets put together and we give this huge gift.
[time=3340] Yes, James too is talking about that kind of an effort, but it's also talking about the way you act at lunch today.
[time=3349] It's also talking about the way in which you show compassion and sacrifice and kindness in the car on the way to school.
[time=3358] It's also about how you treat a difficult, hurting, in-need coworker.
[time=3366] It's 24/7, it's all the time, it's the characteristic of the believer's life, and a false compassion evidences a problem.
[time=3377] Lastly, and we'll go, a shallow conviction. A dead, worthless faith is exposed as we see in you or in someone a shallow conviction,
[time=3390] and I want to just draw your attention to what it says in verse 19.
[time=3396] You believe that God is one, you do well, the demons also believe and shudder.
[time=3403] Let me just have you stand if you would quietly, and as you stand, let me just say this to you.
[time=3411] If what you're banking on is the fact that you believe in God, let me say that again.
[time=3418] If what you're banking on is that somehow you believe in God, then your conviction has in that been shown to be shallow.
[time=3429] Because my friends, I would say to you in light of what James 2 teaches us here, right there in that verse, that not only is faith without works dead, but faith without works is demonic.
[time=3442] The demons believe that.
[time=3444] You have joined the ranks with Satan and his crew because they all believe the same thing, that he's God.
[time=3454] So that's off the table.
[time=3457] What we're about here is people who believe he's God, who have faith in him and who live lives that evidence that belief.
[time=3466] That is a faith that saves.
[time=3469] Let's pray.
[time=3470] Father, thank you for the time you've given us this morning.
[time=3473] Oh God, we're grateful for the truth of James 2, as many of us in the room read it again and again over these next few weeks.
[time=3481] As we read James 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5, may you fill our hearts and our lives with your truth.
[time=3488] The psalmist said he meditates on it.
[time=3490] The psalmist said he hides it in his heart so that he might not sin against you.
[time=3496] Oh God, we want your truth and the spirit that comes with it to fill us up.
[time=3500] We want to be people who don't sin as a pattern who move in directions of righteousness and obedience and appropriate submission to you.
[time=3508] Oh God, would you allow today in these moments that we've had together?
[time=3512] And would you allow your word and the days to come to move all of us, please God, in that direction we pray?
[time=3518] And everybody agreed with the prayer and said amen.
