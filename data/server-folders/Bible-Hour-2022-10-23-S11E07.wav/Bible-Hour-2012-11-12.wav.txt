[time=30] [MUSIC - 165 seconds]
[time=201] - Thanks Adam.
[time=209] A year ago today, Russell Bird was playing basketball on an aircraft carrier.
[time=217] There were a couple of other games scheduled this year for aircraft carriers.
[time=222] They both were canceled because of some condensation on the floor.
[time=225] Russell played this year, this weekend, and a hanger at an air force base in Germany.
[time=232] I'm grateful, I'm very grateful for those celebrations this weekend.
[time=238] The draw our attention to men and women around the world who are serving our country often in harm's way.
[time=245] It's good to be reminded.
[time=247] I think we often forget.
[time=248] We've been at war now in parts of the world for over 10 years.
[time=252] I think it's easy sometimes to forget the longer that those things go on, the sacrifices being made on the ground today.
[time=260] It will be appropriate for us as a church to do two things today to recognize those among us who have served in the armed forces and then to pray for those who currently are serving, again in harm's way around the world.
[time=272] If you're in the room today and you've served in the armed forces at some point, would you please stand so we can thank you and recognize you this morning?
[time=279] (audience applauds) Thank you.
[time=297] Thank you very much for your service.
[time=301] Let's pray, folks, it will be appropriate again this morning to pray as we begin for those serving this morning, for their protection, and for their soon and safe arrival home.
[time=313] Would you please join me in prayer?
[time=315] The guy I thank you for the men and women in the room that stood today, 7%.
[time=322] I read this week, 7% of Americans have worn the uniform.
[time=326] And we all know someone, God very likely who has or who is.
[time=331] And this morning we thank you for their service, for their work and the protection of the freedoms that we enjoy, and the others enjoy around the world.
[time=338] We pray this morning for many God in harm's way and far away places, away from their spouses, away from their kids.
[time=349] I pray that you would, God help us to be creative as to how we might be an encouragement to them, not only on a Veteran's Day weekend, but God throughout the year, especially as the holidays approach.
[time=360] God, may we be creative, may we be diligent and faithful and careful to remember those who have sacrificed so much.
[time=368] And God this morning as we gather in worship, in a much greater way, we remember, and we offer you praise for the sacrifice of your son, Jesus, who loved us and gave himself for us.
[time=382] May you be pleased by all that is said and done here this morning.
[time=387] I pray these things in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=389] There is now one in your bulletins, you're welcome to follow along.
[time=394] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=396] I'm a teaching pastor here at the church.
[time=397] Next year will be my 10th year of teaching at the school.
[time=401] We've been at the church for a few years helping.
[time=403] Kelly is actually driving to Michigan this morning with his son, Jake, for some music rehearsing.
[time=410] So back from Germany last night, Kelly, off to Michigan this morning, pray for Kelly in his travels.
[time=417] I'd also want to have you jot down as we begin this morning.
[time=420] Josh rang with us a couple of weeks ago.
[time=422] Josh's daughter Jillian, little girl Jillian, how old, Jody?
[time=426] Seven.
[time=428] Had emergency appendic surgery just a couple of days ago.
[time=432] She's fine, but in recovery.
[time=434] So I'd cover your prayers for Josh rang's daughter Jillian this morning as she recovers from surgery.
[time=439] She's okay, but certainly anxious moments for everybody involved.
[time=443] James III is a familiar passage to a lot of us and it talks about the tongue and the great power of the tongue and James helps us in this passage by laying out lots of word pictures as to how powerful the tongue, very small thing, how much power the tongue has.
[time=462] Let's just begin this morning by taking all these word pictures that James lays out before us and putting some images to the words.
[time=471] The first thing it says in verses three and four is that we put bits into the mouth of horses and a bit weighs only a few ounces, but the average horse weighs about a thousand pounds.
[time=483] You can direct a very large animal with a very small thing in its mouth.
[time=487] James also goes on to say also that there are ships, very, very large driven by strong winds, but directed by a small rudder.
[time=496] There's a picture up on the screen behind me in front of you of both a rudder and of a large vessel.
[time=503] This is the SS France, it weighs 78,000 tons.
[time=509] And its rudder weighs less than 1/10 of 1% of that weight and directs the whole things.
[time=516] That blown about by the wind this thing, transatlantic ocean liner, no wind's blowing it around.
[time=521] It's not like they were in the first century, but you get the picture.
[time=524] A very large object directed by a very small thing, a very powerful, very dare I say it, an instrumental thing.
[time=535] James goes on, more word pictures, verse five in James three.
[time=540] If you have your Bibles, please go to James three.
[time=542] He says how great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire.
[time=547] A gentleman named Lewis M. Cone has tried to take CHON, had tried to take credit in recent years before his death for the great Chicago fire.
[time=559] Often legend says by a cow in Mrs. O'Leary shed
[time=565] kicking over, I'm sure you over all hold that story.
[time=566] (humming) Right, okay.
[time=569] That's not how it probably went.
[time=571] No one really knows how it started, but legend says it was the cow in the shed and the whole thing.
[time=575] Well, Mr. Cone's steadfastly maintained the traditional story of the cause of the fire, Mrs. O'Leary's cow, was untrue.
[time=584] He said he and Mrs. O'Leary's son, in the company of several other boys, were shooting dice in the hay loft of the barn by the light of a lantern.
[time=594] But one of the boys accidentally kicked over the lantern, suiting the barn on fire.
[time=599] And so the story goes, 1871, the great Chicago fire burned large portions of city to a ground, all because of a dice game.
[time=609] A great fire, the really, really small start.
[time=613] The picture begins to emerge.
[time=615] The picture emerged at this little thing, dear friends, that every one of us carry around with us all day long, every day, and it's amazing power.
[time=624] Would you stand with me this morning as we read this passage from James 3?
[time=628] We're gonna read verses one through 12.
[time=630] There is a whole lot here.
[time=634] I don't wanna waste any time.
[time=635] Let's get right to it.
[time=636] Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.
[time=645] We all stumble in many ways.
[time=647] And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body.
[time=654] We put bits into the mouths of horses so they obey us.
[time=657] We guide their whole bodies as well.
[time=659] Look at the ships also that they are so large and driven by strong winds.
[time=664] They are guided by a very small rudder.
[time=667] Wherever the will of the pilot directs.
[time=670] So also the tongue is a small member, but it boasts of great things.
[time=675] I once saw a t-shirt that said, "The older I get, the better I was." How great a forest is set ablaze but it's a small fire.
[time=687] The tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness.
[time=692] The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire, the entire course of life, set on fire by hell.
[time=702] Every kind of beast and bird, reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind.
[time=710] But no human being contained the tongue.
[time=713] It is a restless, evil, full of deadly poison.
[time=718] With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God from the same mouth, come blessing and cursing my brothers, these things ought not to be so.
[time=730] Does a spring pour forth in the same opening, both fresh and salt water?
[time=735] Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs, neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.
[time=744] You may be seated.
[time=746] There are three things to say in your notes this morning.
[time=751] Three things that we, I believe in James 3, are encouraged to be helpful summaries.
[time=758] The first thing to say in verses one through four is I would encourage you to be careful.
[time=764] Be very careful.
[time=768] James begins chapter three with words to teachers and says not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, talking to the church.
[time=777] I have learned this over the years, but to teach is to learn first.
[time=785] All teachers, especially those of God's word, must be and remain humble learners.
[time=796] My mom told a story of talking to a gentleman who's a pastor for 60 years.
[time=801] I'm sure I've told you this before.
[time=804] And he said, what have you learned?
[time=807] She asked him, what have you learned in your 60 years of pastoring?
[time=811] And he said, I've only scratched the surface.
[time=814] So I'll kind of humility friends.
[time=818] If you sit there with your Bibles, or if I sit there with my Bible and say, well yeah, the Bible, I got that, on to other things.
[time=825] Again, it's a lot in there.
[time=828] Again, I'm writing you again.
[time=829] There's a lot in here, and it takes a lifetime friends, day by day, dedication, diligence, to hear what God says there.
[time=838] In colonial America, pastors were the most respected workers in the whole colonies.
[time=843] It wasn't doctors or lawyers, it was pastors.
[time=847] And now it seems that someone has to weigh in on a social issue, we'll bring a token pastor in just because we really need to.
[time=854] In the first century, people aspired to be teachers.
[time=858] If there was no false teaching in the first century church, there would be no New Testament.
[time=863] It wouldn't be there.
[time=864] If you flip through your New Testament and read what Paul says to the churches, they said, don't believe those guys.
[time=869] There were fakes and frauds all over the first century church, striving to get an audience, to grab the microphone from their brother and say, here's what I have to say, here's what I have to say, here's what I have to say.
[time=881] There was all this strife and contention about wanting to be up front, wanting to have people look at them and say, well, my goodness, against that, James says, not many of you should ascribe to become a teacher.
[time=894] Why?
[time=895] Because you know that we who teach will be judged, he says, with greater strictness.
[time=901] So in your outlines and your bulletins, my encouragement to you is to be careful.
[time=905] Why?
[time=906] Because God will judge.
[time=909] God will judge.
[time=912] Let me just stop for a minute, and offer you an encouragement and to make a request.
[time=919] We who serve as your pastors, not only here, but all across God's kingdom, we desperately need your prayers.
[time=931] We desperately need your prayers for that reason alone, but for many, many others.
[time=935] My grandmother prayed for me since I was a little boy,
[time=941] 'cause before I was even born, now she's with the Lord.
[time=944] And I feel the weight of her lost prayers.
[time=949] Now she has, now her faith is sight, so her prayers for me really are being answered in so many ways.
[time=957] Friends, can I ask you this morning to please pray for us?
[time=961] We humbly stand before you, or we ought to, and we humbly sit in our offices and counsel with people, and we try to offer up what God says.
[time=970] By His grace and for His glory, we strive to present every person complete in Christ.
[time=976] That's what we're after.
[time=977] And that's got to be underscored by prayer.
[time=981] I am very much convinced on Veterans Day.
[time=984] I'm very much convinced that people who are prayer warriors, who behind the scenes when nobody sees or knows, pray diligently like my grandmother, those are the people in heaven that receive the glittering price of divine approval.
[time=999] Not people up front, not people who get their names on books or who stand before others, but people who behind the scenes pour out their hearts to God for their fellow man, for their church, for the city.
[time=1012] I'm convinced of that, friends.
[time=1015] So would you please pray, pray for those who teach you, pray that we would be guarded and protected from error and from danger, pray that as we counsel others, that we would be careful, that we would be safe, that we would be always hemmed in and protected by the hedges of God's word and what it says.
[time=1033] Why?
[time=1034] Verse two, because we all stumble in many ways, even your pastors, maybe especially your pastors.
[time=1042] If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, never met one of those.
[time=1047] Able also to bridle his whole body, my goodness.
[time=1053] I was talking with Steve Lombrake after the first service.
[time=1057] He talked about how self-control is a fruit of the spirit.
[time=1060] It's a gift that God gives.
[time=1062] It's not a thing that I can conjure up on my own.
[time=1066] That's why James will go on to say, no human being contained the tongue.
[time=1070] You can't do it.
[time=1072] So the takeaway, I'll give you the takeaway at the end, right here at the beginning.
[time=1077] James is clear that we need to watch what we say.
[time=1080] That's why, because the tongue is this restless evil full of deadly poison and the great beauty and mystery and truth is that you can't watch what you say.
[time=1091] You don't have control of your tongue.
[time=1093] You need God to go before you every step of the day, every hour of the day.
[time=1097] I need you every hour.
[time=1099] We sang that a few weeks ago.
[time=1100] It's still true.
[time=1102] We need him every hour.
[time=1103] And what I say, we take our responsibility seriously,
[time=1110] friends, to teach you what God's word says, but we have to recognize our frailty that everyone stumbles in many ways.
[time=1117] And so we have to be humble.
[time=1119] We have to be careful because God will judge.
[time=1123] God is in control.
[time=1125] Look at verse three, again, bits in the mouths of horses so they obey us.
[time=1130] We guide their whole bodies as well.
[time=1132] Ships so large, driven by strong winds.
[time=1134] They are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.
[time=1142] James 1.26, this bridling language from a couple weeks ago, look at what it says in James 1.26.
[time=1147] If anyone thinks he is religious and doesn't bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this person's religion is what?
[time=1157] What does it say up there?
[time=1159] One more time.
[time=1160] It says it's worthless.
[time=1162] You know what worthless means?
[time=1163] It means worthless.
[time=1165] Means it has no worth.
[time=1168] It's meaningless.
[time=1169] It's like it's not even there.
[time=1173] You have all seen, haven't you?
[time=1175] In your own life and the lives of others, that what people say is often the worst enemy of their testimony.
[time=1182] You say you're this, but you say, what?
[time=1187] You claim to be this, but these words make your religion worthless, vain, empty.
[time=1194] All because I can't control what I say.
[time=1199] All because I'm not careful with my words.
[time=1203] God will judge.
[time=1204] I hear people often talk about the things that churches teach and, well, you teach a God of judgment and that there's gonna be a hell and that, well, yes, we do because that's what God's word says.
[time=1216] James 3 is very plain on that front.
[time=1218] There it is.
[time=1220] God will judge teachers with greater strictness or judgment, but everyone's under that microscope.
[time=1227] And there is a hell that inflames my speech to often be unhelpful and that curses other people.
[time=1235] Not okay.
[time=1238] Look at Matthew chapter 12.
[time=1239] This is a very powerful passage about my words.
[time=1244] No matter how much the apple trees,
[time=1250] do we have a slide of trees?
[time=1251] I think we do have a slide of trees.
[time=1253] No matter how much the apple trees in my backyard want to bear pairs, they will never do it.
[time=1259] They cannot.
[time=1260] So it's an image.
[time=1262] The image is good trees, bad trees, salt water, fresh water.
[time=1268] A salt water spring can't just, oh, fresh water.
[time=1271] It can't do it.
[time=1272] It can't summon it up by itself.
[time=1275] This is the way he says in Matthew 12.
[time=1278] Very, very powerful.
[time=1279] Either make the tree good and it's fruit good, or make the tree bad and it's fruit bad.
[time=1286] The tree is known by its fruit.
[time=1289] We can't fake it.
[time=1292] If you claim to be an apple tree, but all we ever see is, this is James' message.
[time=1298] Faith in works.
[time=1299] If you claim to be an apple tree, but all I ever see is pairs, you have a choice to make.
[time=1304] Either you are mislabeled or something's wrong
[time=1310] with your chemical, I don't know what's going on there, but there's no way to fake that.
[time=1316] You brood of vipers.
[time=1318] He's talking to the Pharisees here.
[time=1320] How can you speak good when you are evil?
[time=1323] Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
[time=1333] The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil.
[time=1340] I tell you on the day of judgment, not my idea.
[time=1347] People will give account for every careless word they speak.
[time=1351] The things in the Bible that I don't understand
[time=1359] aren't the things in the Bible that bother me.
[time=1362] Things in the Bible that bother me are things I do understand.
[time=1365] And I know exactly what that means.
[time=1367] For by your words, you will be justified
[time=1374] and by your words, you will be condemned.
[time=1376] Wow.
[time=1379] Sinclair Ferguson, I watched a sermon that he gave this week and he said, "How dare I destroy with a word a brother for whom Christ died, especially in the context of God's people." How dare I do that?
[time=1395] More to come on that just a little bit.
[time=1398] The next point in your outline this morning is like the first.
[time=1403] Be careful because God will judge number two, be cautious.
[time=1406] Be cautious.
[time=1408] Why?
[time=1409] Because words matter.
[time=1412] Words matter.
[time=1415] A lot of these guys down here have had me for class and if AJ asks me if he can go to the bathroom, I will say, I don't know, can you?
[time=1424] Because what's he really asking me?
[time=1426] May I go to the bathroom?
[time=1429] That's a stupid example, but words matter.
[time=1432] Punctuation matters if you say, let's eat grandma.
[time=1436] There's gotta be a comma in there or it's a very different sentence, isn't it?
[time=1440] (congregation laughing) You're welcome.
[time=1443] What I say matters, if it didn't matter,
[time=1450] then nothing James says in chapter three makes any sense at all.
[time=1455] Look at verse five.
[time=1459] So also like ships and horses, the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things.
[time=1465] How great a forest is set ablaze by a small file.
[time=1470] Listen to verse six, this is incredible.
[time=1474] And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness.
[time=1479] Now I don't know how you could say something stronger than that.
[time=1482] The NIV says, maybe before you, it says a world of evil.
[time=1488] The NASB says, the very world of iniquity.
[time=1492] And the new living translation says, "A whole world of wickedness." You get the picture?
[time=1499] It's unbelievably destructive.
[time=1503] Parents of teenagers, okay?
[time=1508] I'm gonna talk to you just for a minute.
[time=1510] We've talked before from this stage about the burdens placed on young people today when it comes to what they can say.
[time=1520] And there are opportunities to communicate that we didn't have when we were teenagers.
[time=1525] I told you before that when I was a teenager, I wanted to call my friend on the phone.
[time=1528] I was on the couch, get up, go to the kitchen, pick up the phone, dial the number.
[time=1531] Hi Mrs. Norris is Steve there, right?
[time=1534] Five or six steps in between.
[time=1535] They have none of those steps.
[time=1536] They wanna say it and out it comes.
[time=1540] Helpful or not helpful?
[time=1542] There it is.
[time=1543] That's not easy for them.
[time=1548] It's difficult for them.
[time=1549] Pray for your students.
[time=1551] Pray for them as they navigate the waters of social media, Facebook, and Twitter, and all of those things.
[time=1559] There are cries for help everywhere there.
[time=1561] And there are no hedges of protection.
[time=1565] If I wanna text message somebody, then when I'm mad with them and be careless, it's very easy.
[time=1572] There is nothing in between it.
[time=1573] It's two buttons and out it goes.
[time=1575] Be careful, you guys.
[time=1579] Be cautious, be careful, because words matter.
[time=1582] My words, how many of you can remember, I'll ask for a show of hands here.
[time=1587] How many of you can remember a hurtful word spoken to you as a child?
[time=1593] Good, raise them so we can all see.
[time=1596] Raise them everywhere, all over the room.
[time=1599] Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words, that's a lie.
[time=1602] That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life.
[time=1606] It's not true.
[time=1607] It pretends as though the James 3.6 isn't true,
[time=1613] which is even a bigger problem.
[time=1615] It says that the tongue is able to set on fire
[time=1623] the whole course of my life.
[time=1626] The original language says, the whole wheel of my birth, all of it, it says it can stain, defile, and corrupt my whole body.
[time=1637] You guys, our tongues are positioned in such a way, but they have an incredible capacity, an unparalleled capacity to defile, to stain, and to corrupt.
[time=1646] Lives, my own life, and the lives of people around me.
[time=1649] So is it too much to be careful?
[time=1652] Is it too much to be cautious?
[time=1654] I don't think it is.
[time=1656] We can't be careless with fire.
[time=1661] And just exactly what James does in chapter three, he attaches my tongue to fire, that can destroy and consume all of these things.
[time=1670] This is from something written this week by a guy I'm Trevin Wax.
[time=1675] I found it very, very helpful.
[time=1678] Taming the tongue may be one of the most difficult tasks for the follower of Christ, but thankfully, Jesus reminds us, clearly, the changing the heart is the key to controlling the tongue.
[time=1691] So if you just stop saying bad words, you can pull it off for a few weeks, maybe.
[time=1696] But that's not the point.
[time=1698] You cannot change your own heart, Jesus can.
[time=1702] That's the good news of the gospel.
[time=1703] And then once he does that, what you say will change.
[time=1706] It's beautiful.
[time=1708] So there is this false gospel, friends, this gospel of sin management, which means stop saying those words, stop watching those things, stop going those places, and you'll be okay.
[time=1719] That's what faith, that's works salvation.
[time=1723] The very salvation that James is not trumpeting in his blooder.
[time=1726] You cannot do those things well enough, that's the point.
[time=1732] But James, on the other hand, remember James and Paul back to back, will be helpful analogy from Kelly last week.
[time=1736] Remember that?
[time=1737] They're fighting together, not each other.
[time=1742] You cannot tame your tongue.
[time=1745] No human being, verse eight, can tame the tongue.
[time=1750] You can't.
[time=1751] That's where God comes in.
[time=1754] He can.
[time=1754] Beautiful promise, a beautiful encouragement this morning.
[time=1759] This is a, I don't recommend a book to you, more than one today.
[time=1763] But one that's been a huge blessing to Kelly and I and others on staff is a book called Life Together by Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
[time=1771] I come back to this book so very many times.
[time=1776] And I thought of this in all kinds of applications to this in our life.
[time=1781] Here's what he says in Life Together.
[time=1783] Often we combat our evil thoughts most effectively if we absolutely refuse to allow them to be expressed in words.
[time=1790] Thus it must be a decisive rule of every Christian fellowship that each individual is prohibited from saying much that occurs to him.
[time=1802] How about, how about that in your marriage?
[time=1804] The marital council I give to others and to myself by association is, you know, much of what occurs to you to say that maybe is true shouldn't be said.
[time=1816] Things about your kids that you could say, you shouldn't say.
[time=1822] At your job, it's probably true.
[time=1828] It doesn't need to be said.
[time=1830] My mom used to always say, is it true?
[time=1832] Is it kind?
[time=1834] Is it necessary?
[time=1834] Sometimes true, but not kind.
[time=1837] Sometimes true may be kind, not necessary.
[time=1839] And that's the picture.
[time=1842] I've heard that so many times in my life and it's still true.
[time=1847] It must be a decisive rule of every Christian fellowship
[time=1853] that each individual is prohibited from saying much that occurs to him.
[time=1856] That is really true.
[time=1857] You've all lived that.
[time=1859] Look at some verses from the Old Testament.
[time=1860] Look at Psalm 120.
[time=1862] Psalm 120.
[time=1863] Echoes of James 3.
[time=1867] In my distress, I called to the Lord.
[time=1869] He answered me, deliver me O Lord from lying lips from a deceitful tongue.
[time=1874] What shall be given you?
[time=1876] And what more shall be done to you, you deceitful tongue?
[time=1879] A warrior's sharp arrows.
[time=1883] Glowing coals of the broom tree.
[time=1886] I'm told that a broom tree makes for excellent charcoal.
[time=1890] That's what he says.
[time=1893] Harmful words are like those burning embers, burning coals.
[time=1898] And you've all, by virtue of raising your hands, experienced what those things are like.
[time=1903] Harmful, hurtful words.
[time=1905] You know this is true from James 3.
[time=1908] You know the tongue is a world of evil because you've seen it in your own life and you've been wounded by it.
[time=1916] Proverbs chapter four.
[time=1920] The proverbs are filled up with verses about the tongue, friends, filled up with verses about them.
[time=1925] Look at verse 20, Proverbs four.
[time=1927] My son be attentive to my words and climb your ear to my sayings.
[time=1932] Let them not escape from your sight, keep them within your heart.
[time=1935] For they are life to those who find them and healing to all their flesh.
[time=1941] I was told by someone recently, that one of my students described my class as life-giving.
[time=1948] And I almost fell down on the floor.
[time=1951] I don't think I've ever been given a greater compliment than that.
[time=1954] I hope it's true.
[time=1957] I hope that every conversation that you have with people is life-giving.
[time=1962] You've talked to people, haven't you?
[time=1965] You feel this, the air and the room is just sucked out.
[time=1968] Is there happening?
[time=1969] I see some nodding heads.
[time=1971] Don't be that person.
[time=1974] Keep your heart with all vigilance.
[time=1976] For from it flow the springs of life, you see this?
[time=1979] The heart, Matthew 12, the heart is the source of all this either evilness or goodness.
[time=1987] Put away from you crooked speech.
[time=1989] Put devious talk far from you.
[time=1991] Let your eyes look directly forward.
[time=1995] Let your gaze and your gaze be straight before you ponder the path of your feet, then all your ways will be sure do not serve to the right or left.
[time=2005] Turn your foot away from evil.
[time=2007] Proverbs 12, there's more, but wait, there's more.
[time=2012] Verse 18, there is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts.
[time=2020] I think that's what we were talking about a few minutes ago.
[time=2028] This is the pain of those words being spoken to us.
[time=2031] How it hurts.
[time=2033] The tongue of the wise brings healing.
[time=2037] Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue is for a moment.
[time=2043] I hope that we have eternal impact with our words, friends,
[time=2049] and that they don't just kind of flights of fancy off the cuff.
[time=2053] There's two things going on here.
[time=2058] There's the positive and the negative.
[time=2059] There's the say and the don't say.
[time=2062] And you can never just not say stuff.
[time=2064] Well, they'll let that be enough.
[time=2066] It's not God's design.
[time=2068] That's not God's intention.
[time=2070] The Christian life is not a list of don'ts.
[time=2073] The Christian life is married, marries the don'ts with things that I now do more on that later.
[time=2080] But please be careful.
[time=2082] That's not what the gospel says.
[time=2083] It's not a one-footed gospel.
[time=2086] Just stop doing all these things, and that's it.
[time=2089] Are there things the Bible says to leave behind?
[time=2091] Yes, but don't stop there.
[time=2095] Your bulletin says Mark 4.
[time=2096] That was my mistake.
[time=2097] It's actually Mark 7.
[time=2101] Take a look at these verses.
[time=2102] Jesus is talking to people about what makes them unclean.
[time=2107] And I found his response very compelling.
[time=2110] He called the people to him and said to them, hear me all of you understand.
[time=2115] There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him.
[time=2121] The things that come out of a person are what defile him.
[time=2125] You know, the house and let the people, the disciples asked him about the parable.
[time=2128] He said to them, are you so without understanding?
[time=2131] Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside can't defile him?
[time=2135] And it's not his heart, but his stomach and his expelled goes to the bathroom.
[time=2140] Let's see, declared, all foods clean.
[time=2142] He said.
[time=2144] What comes out of a person is what defiles him.
[time=2147] From within, out of the heart of man,
[time=2153] you don't need to stop cursing.
[time=2157] You don't need to stop spending your money in the wrong place.
[time=2160] You need a new heart.
[time=2162] And when you have a new heart, those things will follow.
[time=2166] Otherwise, you're just dressing up ugliness.
[time=2169] Christ describes those things as whitewashed tombs.
[time=2174] Out of the heart of man come evil thoughts.
[time=2179] We've all heard that objection.
[time=2180] Wow, I was never going to act on it.
[time=2182] I wasn't going to do anything about it.
[time=2184] He starts with evil thoughts, you guys.
[time=2188] He begins there, evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.
[time=2200] All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.
[time=2204] Verse 7, James 3.
[time=2210] "Every kind of beast and bird of reptile and sea creature can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind." Michael-- I met Michael Womer in 1983.
[time=2220] And Michael Womer told us as a class one day, he was going to be the first person to train an alligator.
[time=2228] He was going to do it.
[time=2229] We live in Florida, so that made sense.
[time=2231] Now, 30 years later, Michael Womer has a business where he wrestles alligators and goes into schools and does productions.
[time=2239] Is James saying in his passage that every animal in the world know, saying all kinds of animals have been tamed by people, even alligators, Michael, have been tamed, but no one the next verse says.
[time=2254] Have you seen that show "Call of the Wild Man"?
[time=2256] Have you ever seen that show?
[time=2258] That is an unbelievable show.
[time=2259] The guy rustles possums and raccoons and snakes and all kinds of crazy stuff.
[time=2264] It is the most amazing Google that you'll thank me later.
[time=2267] But no human being can tame the tongue.
[time=2277] Again, it's a different gospel if you say stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[time=2283] And the gabbos say, well, I'm glad you stopped.
[time=2285] Now you can be in my team.
[time=2289] We need new hearts, friends, a new creation.
[time=2292] Every 17 years, periodical cicadas emerge.
[time=2300] You know what those are?
[time=2303] 500 trillion eggs get laid.
[time=2307] And there they are, out in front.
[time=2309] 500 trillion eggs, 17 years, they're everywhere.
[time=2314] It's a great reminder of untamed nature and how powerless we are to resist it.
[time=2322] My friend Jill Caratini said this.
[time=2325] Like insects whose communal emerging reminds us that all is not as tidy and peaceful as it appears within our gardens.
[time=2334] So the tongue reminds us that much is lurking within our hearts.
[time=2338] The tongue is a detestable creature, like a cicada.
[time=2344] A restless evil.
[time=2346] In its toxic influence, we are reminded of our need for one who hears our words, quiets our tongues, and gives us a better word.
[time=2355] We remember the God who made tame the lions who shared a den with Daniel and the ravens, which brought Elijah bread both morning and night.
[time=2363] It is this God who can tame also our tongues.
[time=2367] No human being can, but God can.
[time=2372] I'll say it again and ask it to respond.
[time=2374] No human being can tame the tongue, but God can.
[time=2378] Thank you for responding.
[time=2380] It's true.
[time=2381] It's good to respond to true things.
[time=2383] But you need to know that you can't do this and that's the point.
[time=2388] The point is that you cannot love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[time=2393] And you need the grace of the gospel to enter in and make you a new person.
[time=2398] And that offer stands ready every minute of every day.
[time=2403] We're gonna sing in a minute about where our hope is found and all the reasons we have to praise the Lord and there are lots of them.
[time=2410] That's but one.
[time=2411] The last thing in your outline is number three there.
[time=2415] It says to be clear.
[time=2416] Be clear.
[time=2419] First Peter chapter four, verse seven says, "The end of all things is near." And if it was near 2,000 years ago and Peter wrote that, it's even nearer today.
[time=2427] My daughter would say we're at the various end.
[time=2431] The various end.
[time=2432] "Therefore be clear-minded," he says in verse seven.
[time=2435] "Be clear-minded and self-controlled so you can pray." So let's be clear about who we are.
[time=2444] We need to be clear because of who we are.
[time=2447] That's the third and final point in your outline.
[time=2450] Be clear because of who we are.
[time=2454] Look at verse nine.
[time=2455] "With our tongues we bless our Lord and Father "and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God.
[time=2462] "From the same mouth, complesing and cursing, "my brothers, these things ought not to be so." I'm teaching a grow group across the street.
[time=2477] We went this morning early so I could be here with you folks.
[time=2480] On Tim Keller's book, "Generous Justice," that I mentioned to you over the summer, I'm teaching a class on it for four weeks now.
[time=2487] It's been an incredible experience for us.
[time=2490] He talks about these verses in the chapters we did for today, so it was a wonderful coincidence.
[time=2496] "With it we bless our Lord and Father "and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God." The word image also can mean to resemble, he says, as a child resembles a parent or to represent, as a mirror reflects, represents an object.
[time=2516] A mirror can't depict an object in all its dimensions, yet the image upon it is a true likeness.
[time=2521] The Bible teaches us the sacredness of God has in some ways been imparted to humanity so that every human life is sacred and every human being has dignity.
[time=2533] When God put his image on us, we became beings of infinite in estimable value.
[time=2544] Unborn life is precious to God.
[time=2549] Immigrant life, precious to God, the poor, the fatherless, the widow, the elderly, all life matters to God.
[time=2562] The church needs to be careful, friends, to have what some call a consistent ethic of human life.
[time=2568] All life matters to God.
[time=2570] You have never met C.S. Lewis says this, "You have never met a mere mortal.
[time=2575] "Every human being you've ever met will live forever, "and they are infinitely valuable to God." Verse Peter 4, 7 says that we should be clear-minded.
[time=2592] Listen to what else he says later on in that passage.
[time=2595] Above all, verse 8, first Peter 4,
[time=2601] loads other deeply because love covers over a multitude of sins, offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.
[time=2607] Each one should use whatever gift he's received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms.
[time=2614] If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God.
[time=2621] If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God provides so in all things God may be praised, so in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ, to him be the glory and the power for ever and ever.
[time=2634] [AMEN] Words matter.
[time=2637] And I should be clear because of who we are, made in God's likeness.
[time=2646] I was struck, these will be on the screen behind me, I was struck that three times in the Bible's first nine chapters that truth has mentioned, check it out.
[time=2654] Genesis 1, 26, then God said let us make man in our image
[time=2660] after our likeness.
[time=2662] Genesis 5, verse one.
[time=2666] This is the book of the generations of Adam.
[time=2668] When God created man, he made him in the likeness of men of God rather, one more time.
[time=2674] Genesis 9, verse six, here God affirming that people matter to him and so killing them matters to him too.
[time=2682] Whoever sets the blood of man by man shall his blood be shed because God made man in his own image.
[time=2688] Three times in the first nine chapters of the Bible.
[time=2691] I think he means it.
[time=2693] I think he sincerely means that you matter to him, that all human beings matter to him, despite their race, despite their politics, they all matter to him.
[time=2706] And with my, the mouth that blesses God often curses people across the aisle, across town,
[time=2716] across the world, these things ought not to be so.
[time=2720] Then and now, this idea being made in the image
[time=2726] of God keeps going though, Ephesians 4, verse 20.
[time=2730] That's not the way you learn Christ.
[time=2733] Assuming you have heard about him and were taught in him as the truth is in Jesus, to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds and to put on the new self created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.
[time=2757] Colossians three, verse five, put to death therefore, what is earthly in you, sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire and covetousness, which is idolatry,
[time=2773] on account of these, the wrath of God is coming, the wrath of God is God's idea.
[time=2777] And these two, in these you two once walked and you were living in them, but now you must put them all away.
[time=2785] Anger, wrath, malice, slander, obscene talk from your mouth.
[time=2790] Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self and its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.
[time=2806] When we do not recognize that we're made in God's image, we become like a kind of, we have this identity crisis.
[time=2812] We would flail around, some people, their whole lives, friends, they flail around trying to make sense of things because they've forgotten who they are or they haven't been told who they are, they need to know.
[time=2828] I wanna end this morning as the band comes with that full quote from C.S. Lewis from his book called The Weight of Glory.
[time=2835] I've, Keller mentioned this in his book as well.
[time=2841] I think it's worth repeating.
[time=2842] Be clear because of who we are, because we're made in God's image.
[time=2848] Lewis says this, "Remember the dullest "and most uninteresting person you talk to "may one day be a creature, "which if you saw it now, "you would strongly be tempted to worship "or else a horror and a corruption, "such as you now meet if only in your nightmares." Friends all day long, we are in some degree helping each other to one or other of these destinations.
[time=2874] It's in the light of these overwhelming possibilities.
[time=2877] It's with the awe and the circumspection looking all around, proper to them that we should conduct all our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics, he says.
[time=2891] There are no ordinary people.
[time=2895] You have never talked to a mere mortal.
[time=2899] God may it be so.
[time=2903] May we be careful and cautious and clear in our lives because people matter to you, because words matter to you, because you will judge God, I pray, if there's someone in this room who has been lied to you, and I think the gospel is don't, don't, don't, and not a new heart and new creation.
[time=2933] I pray you'd see me after the service today, and I could talk to them about your great and good news.
[time=2939] I think for the chance now to sing about where our hope is placed.
[time=2945] I think of the chance now to sing about reasons to praise you.
[time=2948] God may it be so with our lives.
[time=2951] I pray all these things in Jesus name.
[time=2953] [AMEN] (gentle guitar music)
