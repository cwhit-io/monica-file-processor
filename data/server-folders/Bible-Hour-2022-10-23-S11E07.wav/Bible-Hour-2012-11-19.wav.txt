[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - We're in week four, or shall we have you?
[time=35] Week four, thanks.
[time=39] Week four of James today, and so if you want to get your Bible on, get it ready, go ahead, turn to chapter four in James.
[time=47] I'm excited.
[time=49] I hope it's been encouraging to you.
[time=51] I hope it's been challenging at times.
[time=53] I hope it's been convicting.
[time=55] I hope it's been shaping and molding you.
[time=57] And as a church, black-onk, we believe, we exist to help people, you and I become complete in Christ.
[time=65] That's what we want to be about.
[time=66] That's what we want to help.
[time=67] That's what we want to think through.
[time=69] We want to think how can we become more complete?
[time=71] How can we move closer to Christ?
[time=75] And my role here has changed a little bit from these beautiful students, right?
[time=79] As my main focus, I love you guys.
[time=81] How's everybody doing?
[time=83] Nerf night?
[time=83] They had a middle school had a Nerf night.
[time=87] Not only did they have middle school kids, about 50 or so, 64 to be exact.
[time=95] But then they armed them with guns, okay?
[time=100] And some of these brave souls over here, we're working with these middle school kids.
[time=104] And that's just a cool thing.
[time=106] But that's what I used to do.
[time=107] Nerf stuff and Taco Bell, and I still do that.
[time=110] It's just a little older people now.
[time=112] No Nerf.
[time=114] Well maybe, I'll try to work that into as our elder meetings.
[time=118] I don't know, I don't know if they'd like that or not.
[time=122] But we need a little energy in there.
[time=123] Maybe I can get some Nerf guns in there.
[time=125] We'll see, I'll talk to KB.
[time=126] But I've been meeting with, so my role is connecting Pastor and Alice, kind of what they call me, that's what I do.
[time=133] And so I'm helping people get connected to smaller settings because we believe that live transformation happens when we kind of get a little smaller, a little closer, and we get to discuss, and we get to talk through things.
[time=144] And hold each other accountable.
[time=146] And so one of the first things that I've been doing is I've been going around and getting to know these men in our church that we call shepherds, right?
[time=155] And these are typically a little older gentlemen.
[time=157] And they're caring for the people who are leading our smaller settings.
[time=161] And one of the first ones I got to meet was Elmer, Elmer Johnson.
[time=165] He's students, right?
[time=168] 16, 15, 16, 17, 18, right in there, right?
[time=171] So that's kind of my world.
[time=172] It was these 15-year-olds, 16-year-olds, getting their license, dating stuff.
[time=177] How's Jesus?
[time=178] I am figuring this faith stuff out.
[time=180] And then I meet with Elmer, who's asking for prayer for a hip surgery, and that God would just give him energy so he can keep going.
[time=188] And so those two spectrums are very different.
[time=192] Elmer, is he in here?
[time=193] Elmer, you in here?
[time=195] Yeah, buddy, your hips doing good, right?
[time=197] Yes, he's gonna run the Boston Marathon.
[time=200] I hear, it's a rumor, I don't know if it's true.
[time=202] But he's gonna go after that.
[time=203] And so it's just a different world between students and older gentlemen, but it's been good.
[time=210] And so, what was the cool part about me?
[time=212] The Elmer is his story.
[time=214] And he shared with me how he came to Christ and how he finally fully surrendered his heart and life to Christ and evolved a medical emergency with his wife.
[time=222] And he had tears telling it, and that made me have tears.
[time=226] And so his story was just powerful and was wonderful.
[time=230] And so that's how I think of, when I think of the scriptures, I think of story.
[time=236] I don't think doctrine, I don't think blueprint for life, I think story.
[time=240] And it's God's story.
[time=241] God's got this story that he's been telling for years and he's been doing something, ever since he'd be created Adam and Eve, right?
[time=249] The Adam and Eve came into the world and sin happened.
[time=252] They messed it all up, chapter three, Genesis chapter three, train wreck.
[time=256] And now, the rest of the story is God doing these things in time and space, coming into the planet, doing things to rescue, to restore, to bring us back to relationship with him so we can know God, right?
[time=270] He wants to be our God and he wants us to be his people.
[time=274] That's the meta narrative, that's the story of the scripture.
[time=277] He is our God, he wants us to be his people.
[time=280] And the climax of this story, the awesome story, is this Messiah has come.
[time=286] The long awaited Messiah has finally come to planet Earth and it's Jesus.
[time=293] And so all these people have been waiting for this Messiah they've been waiting and waiting.
[time=297] And so all of that stuff leading up to Messiah, we can't miss that part of the story that is so key to the gospel.
[time=304] It's not just Jesus came and died on the cross.
[time=306] There's so much more to the gospel than just Jesus died on the cross.
[time=311] We miss that when we shortcut it.
[time=314] And so when Jesus came, he says, repent for the kingdom is near, something is happening.
[time=320] Something in this story, it's taking a turn, it's going somewhere and Jesus is doing this.
[time=326] And he's finally come and everybody's trying to figure this out.
[time=331] And so that's the kingdom we wanna be as people, he is our God and James, the book we're studying, he fits into the story, right?
[time=338] This, he's writing to this community, these people who are trying to figure out in light of Jesus, right?
[time=346] They've embraced Jesus.
[time=347] This is a messianic community who have kind of for so long have been kind of under the Torah, the law.
[time=353] And now Jesus comes to fulfill, not to cancel, not to reinterpret, but to fulfill the law.
[time=359] And now this community is trying to figure out, okay, forever they've been kind of living one way, Jesus comes in.
[time=365] Now how do we live?
[time=368] In light of Jesus, how does faith work?
[time=371] How does our lifestyle work?
[time=373] How do we handle trials that come?
[time=375] How do we deal with people who are using their words improperly?
[time=379] How do we deal with this?
[time=381] And so in light of Christ, James is kind of writing this holistic spirituality book, this letter, this, these writings.
[time=390] And he's saying, hey, Jesus affects all of your life.
[time=394] It's not, he's not saying, okay, Jesus, now you have to do these things, right?
[time=399] He's not adding to Christ, he's saying, because Christ has done what he has done, you are saved.
[time=404] Now in light of that, because we are so grateful for that, because of what Jesus has done, when the Messiah has come, in light of that, here is how we live as a response to that.
[time=414] Not to gain salvation, not to gain God's favor, not works salvation.
[time=420] He's not adding to the cross, right?
[time=423] He's adding Jesus to your life.
[time=426] And that's what, that's kind of how we enter into James.
[time=429] This is kind of what's happening in, and chapter four, chapter four, that was what we're gonna do today, is kind of an echo of Jesus' message to repent, right?
[time=440] This is a big smackdown.
[time=443] James is just gonna hit us in the face with the scriptures.
[time=447] He's angry, he's a little frustrated.
[time=449] There's things happening in this community that are not right.
[time=453] In fact, they are so off, they are wrong.
[time=456] And so here's what I'd like you to do.
[time=458] I'll worry, I'll just close your eyes.
[time=461] I'm not gonna throw anything at you, this isn't a trick, okay?
[time=463] I'm just gonna read it, I just want you to close your eyes and just focus on the words.
[time=467] And then we're gonna do James chapter four.
[time=471] So if you would close your eyes.
[time=473] It says this, "What causes quarrels
[time=481] "and what causes fights among you?" This is not this, that your passions are at war within you.
[time=487] You desire and do not have so you murder.
[time=490] You covet and cannot obtain so you fight and quarrel.
[time=494] You do not have because you do not ask.
[time=497] You ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly to spend it on your passions.
[time=502] You adulterous people.
[time=504] Do you not know that friendship with the world is enemy with God.
[time=508] Therefore, whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
[time=512] Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the scripture says he yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us?
[time=522] But he gives more grace.
[time=524] Therefore it says God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
[time=530] Submit yourselves therefore to God.
[time=533] Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[time=535] Draw near to God and he will draw near to you.
[time=538] Cleanse your hands, you sinners and purify your hearts.
[time=541] You double minded.
[time=542] Be wretched and mourn and weep.
[time=546] Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.
[time=550] Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.
[time=555] The message today is very simple.
[time=558] This is how it is.
[time=559] I'm just gonna say it.
[time=560] You can think of this throughout the message.
[time=562] Self-resumhibition, intense jealousy lead to out of control actions which affect our prayers and blind us from the fact that we are cheating on God and dating the world.
[time=570] So knock it off and give yourselves entirely to God.
[time=574] There you go, have a great morning.
[time=575] That's the message.
[time=576] But he begins with this question and he's a little frustrated, okay?
[time=581] We got a little Jerry Springer happening in the community.
[time=584] There's a lot of fighting.
[time=586] There's some fighting, some quarrels.
[time=587] What causes these quarrels?
[time=588] What causes these fights among you?
[time=590] And he doesn't tell us what the issues are.
[time=592] That we don't know if it's, I want red and he wants blue.
[time=596] We don't have like the topic of what they're fighting about.
[time=599] But he's saying these fights and these quarrels are happening and he wants to kind of get behind that, get beyond what they're fighting over and say, why is this happening?
[time=607] What is the source, right?
[time=609] He wants to kind of get into that.
[time=610] And so he follows his first question with a second question that contains the answer.
[time=615] And you always know that you're in trouble when the question has the answer in it that you're in trouble, right?
[time=623] Sweetie, did you take out the trash?
[time=625] Oh, I forgot.
[time=626] Well, did you think it was going to take itself out, right?
[time=630] You know you're in trouble, right?
[time=632] Why did you flunk that test?
[time=634] Was it because you stayed up all night playing Xbox?
[time=637] You know you're busted, right?
[time=638] You know you're in trouble.
[time=640] And so that's what he says.
[time=642] What are these passions, right?
[time=644] So we have to jump back to kind of what he says, oh, I'm sorry.
[time=646] Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you?
[time=649] Right, right, the end of verse one.
[time=650] Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you?
[time=654] So what are these passions?
[time=655] Well, to find out that we've got to jump back to three verse 14 and 16.
[time=660] James 3, 14 says this, but if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast to be false to the truth.
[time=667] And 16 says this for where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder in every vile practice.
[time=675] There are these passions that are at war.
[time=677] There's this bitter jealousy and this selfish ambition.
[time=680] And out of that, they're seeking after their own pleasures.
[time=684] And these pleasures are at war within them.
[time=688] This is kind of behind the scene.
[time=689] This is what the source is, this fighting, this warring and sorting.
[time=693] This is what's happening in the community and it's causing so much disorder and chaos.
[time=697] And so when we think of war, raging war, I think of these passions in us.
[time=702] I think of Romans chapter seven, verse 23, "For I delight in the law of God in my inner being, but I see in my many members, another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members, that waging war." Verse Peter 2, 11 says this, "Beloved, I urge you of sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which rage war against your soul." There's this war happening inside and that's what James wants to get into.
[time=732] And I like to explain it like this, if we use these two tables, right, before Christ, before you stepped across that line to follow Jesus as the come, long-awaited Messiah who has come to planet earth to fulfill God's story and make a new beginning, right?
[time=747] All we could serve is unrighteousness.
[time=749] That was the only choice we had, no matter how many old ladies we helped walk across the street, how many soup kitchens we helped at, we were seen as dead in our transgressions.
[time=758] And so the only thing we could, we had two capacity, we have one capacity, it's this table, unrighteous.
[time=763] And Satan likes to decorate it.
[time=765] He likes to make it look really good.
[time=766] Crispy cream donuts, right?
[time=769] That's what he wants you to think.
[time=770] And it looks really good, oh, it tastes really good, but they taste like poop, right?
[time=774] It tastes good and it's filled with poop.
[time=776] So if I, for the first bite, oh, this tastes good, that's what sin does, right?
[time=779] Tastes really good, oh, man.
[time=781] Later you're like, why did I do that, right?
[time=783] Then the other table is this righteous table.
[time=786] And once you come to Christ, now you can choose between the unrighteous table and the righteous table, the good stuff, yucky.
[time=792] This is really good, right?
[time=793] And now you have, now this is, that's the war, between the unrighteous and the righteous, that you're being pulled and these desires, these passions are warring in you.
[time=802] And you find yourself thinking, you find yourself doing something, you're like, why am I doing this?
[time=808] That's the war, you lost, right?
[time=810] That's the war, you're clicking on things.
[time=812] It's almost like you're in a trance and all of a sudden you find yourself doing something you don't even wanna do, that's the war, these passions waging war inside of us.
[time=820] And that's what James is getting at.
[time=822] He's saying there's things happening in you and they're sinful, you're seeking after pleasure with these selfish ambitions and this intense jealousy.
[time=831] Knock it off.
[time=832] Selfish ambition and intense jealousy to out of control actions.
[time=836] And he continues, verse two, he says, you desire and do not have so you murder, you covet and cannot tame so you fight and quarrel, you do not have because you do not ask.
[time=847] All these can be traced back to the wrongful lust and want more than what we have, want more than what we have, more than what we have.
[time=859] The intense desire or jealousy to have what others have, whether it be their position or their possessions, right?
[time=867] Tense, frustrated desires, the seeking pleasure, this is what's kind of breeding this intense strife, this fighting that is throwing this community into disruption.
[time=879] Now, we kind of see some of this, when you go to a sports game, when you've been to a sports game, any kind of game doesn't matter.
[time=886] NFL, AB, whatever, doesn't matter, right?
[time=888] And you get into the game, the game started and people already their tongue, chapter three tongues are a little out of control, right?
[time=895] They're already insulting the refs, intelligence, right?
[time=898] Then they start saying stuff about his mama, right?
[time=902] Your mama, right?
[time=903] They start just going after the ref and then a bad call happens.
[time=908] Boom!
[time=909] And you can see the other side, right?
[time=911] If you've been on side, you've seen this happen, right?
[time=912] The other side just explodes and people are like leaning, leaning over, they're like ah!
[time=918] And they're almost going to fall into, right?
[time=919] And they're just screaming, they're seething, their blades, their blood vessels are popping, and they're just so mad, it's so intense.
[time=926] And that's just pee-wee soccer.
[time=928] (audience laughing) I'm only kidding by that much.
[time=934] It's crazy out there.
[time=935] Anyway, okay, so these quarrels and these fights, they're intensifying in these desires.
[time=941] It's just getting out of control.
[time=943] See, if we let our passions and our intense desires to run out of control, the danger is always violence.
[time=953] If we let that stuff go unchecked, the danger is violence.
[time=957] Taking a violence, marriage, right?
[time=962] If you are married, you fight.
[time=965] Welcome to it, right?
[time=967] And it usually starts off kind of nice and then all of a sudden dishes are flying up against the wall and doors are getting slammed.
[time=975] Like what happened, right?
[time=978] Because at the very base, she wants what she wants and you want what you want, right?
[time=985] And when these, when we just kind of start letting those go, we don't start checking ourselves.
[time=991] And we're not allowing God to pull us back.
[time=995] It just gets out of control.
[time=996] And violence starts happening.
[time=998] Parents with teens, right?
[time=1001] Teenagers are a gift from God.
[time=1004] And I mean that, I love them.
[time=1006] They're a gift from God because there is no other time in your faith where you will need to rely on God's power than any time in your life.
[time=1014] When you're raising a teenager because you need God.
[time=1018] But they have desires and you have desires and then screaming starts happening.
[time=1022] And this violence escalates.
[time=1024] And then you start yelling and you're like, you're grounded until Jesus comes back, right?
[time=1028] It just gets out of control.
[time=1030] And then they go to the room and slam the door and turn the music up.
[time=1033] And then you're so mad, right?
[time=1035] Moms and dad, in this passage, James is speaking mainly, not only, but mainly to teachers in this community, leaders in the community.
[time=1044] Moms and dads, you're the teachers at your house.
[time=1048] You're the leaders of that home.
[time=1051] And if this intensity and this yelling and screaming is continually happening, that's on you.
[time=1058] We gotta let 16 year olds be 16 year olds.
[time=1063] We're called to be the adults.
[time=1066] And I think that's why James is so frustrated because these teachers who are supposed to be the adults are acting so immaturely, so selfishly, so out of control with bitter envy and selfish ambition.
[time=1080] We gotta watch that.
[time=1082] Whenever there is fighting, the most basic level,
[time=1088] we're trying to get our own way.
[time=1090] And somebody else is trying to get what they want and it's fighting, intense conflict, and this is even affecting their prayers, okay?
[time=1099] At the end of two, it says this, you don't have because you don't ask God.
[time=1108] James is kind of explaining, hey, all of your efforts, all your selfishness, all what you desire, you're seeking after pleasure, you're fighting, you're quarreling, you're coveting, right?
[time=1117] Your efforts are failing because you don't ask God.
[time=1121] You don't have because you don't ask.
[time=1125] What do they want?
[time=1126] What are these teachers, what do they want?
[time=1128] Well, these people want to be teachers.
[time=1130] They want wisdom, they want power, they want prestige that goes with this job.
[time=1135] They want to have control, they want to have power, right?
[time=1138] They wanna be the teachers, they want to be the leaders, they wanna have the power.
[time=1143] And James has already rebuked them for some of this stuff, right?
[time=1146] In chapter three, he's already said, he's already rebuked them for wanting to be teachers.
[time=1151] And then chapter three, a little later, he said, you're priding yourselves and being wise and understanding, they're kind of getting uppity or noses up, they're getting a little arrogant and he's kind of bashing them down a little bit.
[time=1161] And so apparently they wanna lead the church, but they don't have the right tools, they don't have the right spirit, they don't have the right wisdom to do so.
[time=1169] They want control, they want power.
[time=1171] And you don't have because you don't ask, you're failing because you don't ask.
[time=1175] And verse three, you ask, so when you do ask, he says you don't have because you don't ask, but when you do ask, right?
[time=1183] When you semi-come to your senses for at least a little bit, when you do ask, you do not receive because you ask wrongly to spend it on your passions.
[time=1194] See, they were so consumed with their selfish desires, their cravings, their sinful passions, their ambition, they became blind to even asking, to even praying to God.
[time=1206] Their communication with God has been disrupted.
[time=1209] Their prayers have been affected with these desires and it's shaping them.
[time=1214] Their tongues are out of control, which leads to this fighting that's intense and now their actions are out of control and now it's spilled over into their prayers and they're blind, they can't see it.
[time=1225] And prayer in this verse is being kind of compared to currency, it's called current, they're spending it.
[time=1232] Almost like a vending machine, put our money in, boom, out it comes.
[time=1235] And sometimes we treat God like that.
[time=1237] We think, oh, if I just put in my time, boom, I'll put money in, God will give me what I want, right?
[time=1243] He's kind of saying these prayers, you're spending it.
[time=1245] You're spending these prayers on what you think you want.
[time=1247] They're selfish prayers.
[time=1250] And so that got me thinking this week, how do I know, how do we know if our prayers are selfish?
[time=1257] Because when we're talking to God,
[time=1263] I mean, that's pretty intimate, that's a big deal.
[time=1268] It's a privilege to be able to communicate with God at any point in the day.
[time=1273] And so I just, are my prayers selfish?
[time=1277] What am I praying, right?
[time=1280] Because in Matthew, it says asking you shall receive, right?
[time=1283] Seven, seven, says that.
[time=1284] Sometimes we think like that.
[time=1285] God, I want God, Lord Jesus, I pray, for Wrigley Field.
[time=1289] Give me the ballpark, I want Wrigley Field.
[time=1293] 'Cause I can say anywhere I want, right?
[time=1296] That sounds pretty selfish, right?
[time=1299] God, give me a Corvette.
[time=1301] I don't even want a Corvette, I don't like corvettes.
[time=1303] But you know what I'm saying?
[time=1304] How do we know when our prayers are selfish?
[time=1308] How do we know that?
[time=1310] I have two little girls, I love them.
[time=1313] And I don't ever want them to suffer.
[time=1316] I don't want them to have pain.
[time=1317] I don't want them to leave my house.
[time=1321] I don't want them to ever date ever, right?
[time=1325] But I don't think, should I pray that?
[time=1328] Some of the dads are like, yeah, you should pray that.
[time=1334] No, I don't think I should.
[time=1336] So I just got to thinking, how do I know if my prayers are selfish or not?
[time=1340] And so maybe the prayer should be, God, you've given these precious girls, and you asked me to father them.
[time=1349] You asked me to love them, you asked me to raise them.
[time=1352] And God, give me courage to do that.
[time=1354] God, give me strength to do your will.
[time=1356] Maybe that's a better prayer.
[time=1358] But maybe Jesus gave us a pretty good outline
[time=1364] of Matthew's chapter six, verse nine and 10.
[time=1366] He says, "This, our Father in heaven, "howl would be your name, your kingdom come, "your will be done on earth that is is in heaven.
[time=1374] "Give us this day our daily bread, "and forgive us our debtors, "as we have forgiven our debtors." And lead us not in temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[time=1381] That first line, the first verse there, three things, right?
[time=1386] That I think can help us see if our prayers are selfish.
[time=1389] Is it in God's name, howl would be your name?
[time=1393] Is it for God's kingdom, your kingdom come, your kingdom come, God?
[time=1398] And then the last one there, God's will, your will be done.
[time=1401] Those three things, that seems like a good way to say, okay, I think if I can pray all those three, if it lines up with those three, that maybe that's a good prayer, right?
[time=1412] It's just something to consider.
[time=1413] Our sins, our selfish desires, what we want to happen is that blinding us from communicating properly with God.
[time=1425] It's just a gut check.
[time=1429] It's just something to think about.
[time=1430] I'm not saying you are, I'm not saying I am, I'm just saying man, what's a great thing to think about?
[time=1436] How are my prayers?
[time=1439] How am I doing with those prayers?
[time=1441] Are they his name, his kingdom, his will?
[time=1445] Or is it in my name for my world and all about my desires?
[time=1452] There's something to think about.
[time=1454] Okay, now this text turns ugly, okay?
[time=1459] James 4-4, he says this.
[time=1463] You adulterous people, James is not happy.
[time=1468] Side note, this doesn't count.
[time=1471] I asked Webby today because he gave us a great message on the tongue, right?
[time=1477] And I said, Webby, he just said about the tongue, be careful, be cautious, it's necessary, what he said, right about, you gotta watch your tongue 'cause it's so powerful.
[time=1487] But then he comes in here and he says, you adulterous people, seems contradictory.
[time=1493] How can he say, watch what you say and then call these people adulterers?
[time=1499] Just thought, and Webby never gave me an answer.
[time=1503] But here's what I think, I think two things.
[time=1508] One, it's true, right?
[time=1511] That's what they're doing.
[time=1512] So I think he's okay.
[time=1513] And the other thing is, he knows these people.
[time=1517] He loves them, he cares about them.
[time=1520] He doesn't want them just to keep on going the way they're living, right?
[time=1524] And he's calling them back to something and because he's in relationship with them, he can pretty much call them whatever he wants, right?
[time=1530] It's like your buddy, you got a good buddy, right?
[time=1532] They can get you, there's some give there, right?
[time=1536] When your buddy says, well, you're so dumb, right?
[time=1538] You know they're not really saying that you're dumb, right?
[time=1542] You know what I'm talking about?
[time=1544] Or you've got friends you can just really go after and it's okay 'cause you're trying to help them grow, right?
[time=1550] Dude, what are you doing, that's right?
[time=1553] I think there's a relationship with them.
[time=1554] I think that's so important as we think about us and how we're doing in our relationships.
[time=1559] Do you have people in your life who are gonna call you adulterous?
[time=1563] Do you have people in your life that are gonna call you back from where you're going?
[time=1568] Do you have people in your life who are saying, hey, you're headed for the edge, stop, right?
[time=1574] Sometimes that was student ministries for me, right?
[time=1577] I'm not gonna yell at these kids.
[time=1578] It's not my job to tell 'em if they should date or not.
[time=1581] But when I see 'em getting close to the edge, I'm saying, hey, stop, don't go any further, right?
[time=1587] We need people to call us back to God.
[time=1591] And I think that's what James is doing, the heart of a pastor, he's saying, you adulterous people, you morons, what are you doing?
[time=1599] I can't tell you how many kids I've said, you're an idiot, but I love you, right?
[time=1606] Students, grace says I love you, truth says you're an idiot, right?
[time=1612] Right, amen, okay.
[time=1615] You adulterous people, do you not know that friendship with the world is enemy with God?
[time=1620] Therefore, whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
[time=1625] This is one of the most strongly worded calls to repentance in all of the New Testament.
[time=1630] This is powerful, he's going after them because he cares, because he loves them.
[time=1637] He's a pastor, he's a shepherd trying to help his sheep.
[time=1641] He uses the word adulterous, he's labeling them unfaithful people of God.
[time=1645] You are cheating on God
[time=1651] by seeking friendship with the world.
[time=1654] By following the patterns and the ways of the world, James is saying this is unfaithfulness to God.
[time=1660] And in doing these things, you are transferring your friendship from God and placing your allegiance in the world and not God.
[time=1668] Now there's no evidence that says this is exactly what they're doing, they're saying heck with God, we're going this way, it didn't seem like but it's small steps over time.
[time=1679] Small steps over time and all of a sudden we look back and Jesus is clear over there and we look nothing like him.
[time=1688] Small steps over time.
[time=1691] See in verse chapter two, there was some discriminating against some people going on in this community.
[time=1697] They weren't treating each other fairly.
[time=1699] And so he says that in two and then in verse, chapter three as Webby told us, they're speaking, their words were just so vicious and mean out of control.
[time=1710] And there's bitter envy was seeping in and selfish ambition at the end of three.
[time=1713] And then the beginning of our text was they're seeking after just their pleasures, they're going after their own selfishness, envy, they're just going after whatever they want to go after.
[time=1723] See these little small steps over time are leading them away from God and towards the pattern and the way of the world.
[time=1731] And that's what's happening.
[time=1732] It's a slow process over time.
[time=1734] I think I told this story first hour.
[time=1736] I had a car, a 782 cutlass.
[time=1740] And I think the engine had like a hamster and a wheel in it.
[time=1744] And actually, Stacey's mother well, it hit her dog as a kid.
[time=1752] My brother ran over her dog.
[time=1753] The dog lived.
[time=1754] It was weird, but he lived.
[time=1756] Anyway, so I had this car after my brother had it.
[time=1760] So it was just trashed.
[time=1761] And so a rocket came up and hit the top of the hood.
[time=1764] And there was this little ding in it, a little paint chip, right?
[time=1766] Well, I didn't do anything because who cares?
[time=1768] It's a really bad car.
[time=1769] And so over time, the thing just kept getting bigger and bigger
[time=1776] and bigger.
[time=1777] Then she was like, this big, because they didn't take care of it, because they didn't fix it.
[time=1783] And that's kind of this as we kind of sway towards things of the world.
[time=1786] Sometimes it's just one step after a slow, gradual process.
[time=1790] And first John, too, says this, do not love the world or the things in the world.
[time=1795] If anyone loves the world, the love of the father is not in him.
[time=1800] For all that is in the world, the desires of the flesh, the desires of the eyes, and the pride of life is not from the father, but is from the world.
[time=1808] And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.
[time=1815] And he's reminding us that this process can happen when we start heading away from God and towards the world.
[time=1821] Look at verse five.
[time=1823] Now it gets a little more serious.
[time=1825] Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says?
[time=1830] He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us.
[time=1836] The message version of the Bible translate that verse like this.
[time=1842] And do you suppose God doesn't care that you're headed that way?
[time=1847] The proverb has it that he's a fiercely jealous lover.
[time=1854] And what he gives in love is far better than anything else you'll find, a fiercely jealous lover.
[time=1863] Change the saying, you're cheating on God.
[time=1866] And God is the out of control, jealous boyfriend, who is absolutely right in everything he says and does.
[time=1874] He is the jealous boyfriend who is jealous for you.
[time=1878] You're his.
[time=1879] That matters.
[time=1880] He takes it very seriously.
[time=1883] When we start down paths away from God, God is jealous.
[time=1889] He does not want us going that way.
[time=1892] If you've ever dated, you know what I'm talking about.
[time=1895] If you've dated somebody and then, oh, guess what?
[time=1898] It broke up, you'll figure.
[time=1899] That happens all the time.
[time=1900] You break up and there's pain and it goes through to pain and laughing and tears and sad movies and bomb bonds and food, right?
[time=1906] You go through that process of grieving.
[time=1907] But at some point in that process, at some point, somewhere inside you, maybe they start dating somebody else, ooh, that hurts.
[time=1917] Especially, it's like the next week, ow, right?
[time=1920] You already feel rejected.
[time=1921] But at some point in there, you think, they're better off with me.
[time=1925] She's so much better off with me.
[time=1927] He's a loser, right?
[time=1929] That's what God is saying.
[time=1930] He's saying, you're so much better off with me.
[time=1933] I'm God.
[time=1934] I'm a better.
[time=1935] I've got it all.
[time=1937] I got it.
[time=1938] You should be with me.
[time=1940] You should not be with anybody else.
[time=1942] And when we start heading towards maybe its business practices that are just a little shady, one step,
[time=1950] maybe it's just how we handle our money and we just don't do a really good job with all of that stuff and that's one step, right?
[time=1956] We start putting our hope and our faith.
[time=1958] We start kind of trusting in those things.
[time=1961] God's saying, whoa, I'm God.
[time=1964] I'm a jealous lover.
[time=1966] Don't you head down that way?
[time=1967] Maybe when we buy into lives that our value is found and what we wear or what our shape or how we look or how much money we have or our accomplishments.
[time=1977] If we get A's, if we make that corporate office, if we make that big sale, right?
[time=1982] We start finding our value in that.
[time=1984] God, you're just saying that stuff will never fill you.
[time=1987] And that is not what it's about.
[time=1989] I am what it's about.
[time=1991] I'm jealous for you.
[time=1994] Your mind.
[time=1995] I freaking made you.
[time=1998] Your mind.
[time=2000] Don't look to other lovers or other things to fill you.
[time=2002] I'm a jealous God and you belong to me.
[time=2007] Now this jealousy demands total, unrestrained, unreserved, unwavering allegiance from us.
[time=2017] That's what God calls us to.
[time=2019] We are His and He wants us to live as His every moment of every day.
[time=2025] But that standard seems so just scary.
[time=2028] That standard just seems so no way.
[time=2032] I can get there.
[time=2033] There's going to be times when we take steps away, right?
[time=2037] We all do this, where we take a little step over here and God's over here.
[time=2041] Maybe it's just a small compromise, right?
[time=2044] God's not going to write you off.
[time=2045] Look at what He says, verse six, right?
[time=2048] He demands this allegiance to us.
[time=2050] This is what He says, verse six.
[time=2051] But He gives us more grace.
[time=2055] He understands that this calling for un, just totally for Him.
[time=2060] He understands how high of a calling that is and what He wants us to do to love only Him with everything we've got all the time.
[time=2067] And He understands that that's hard.
[time=2068] He understands that that's not going to be easy.
[time=2071] And He says in verse six.
[time=2072] But He gives us more grace so that when we do trip, when we do fall, when we do stumble, when we do take those steps away from the cross, that He's saying, there's grace there.
[time=2083] Get up, come back to me.
[time=2086] Come back to the cross.
[time=2089] God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble and oppressed.
[time=2094] He's reminding us that this grace is completely adequate to meet the requirements posing us by this jealous God.
[time=2101] Augustine said, God gives what He demands.
[time=2108] He demands holiness.
[time=2110] God gives you holiness in His eyes through His grace.
[time=2114] God has a high standard of complete and utter loyalty, love and devotion on us, but He gives us grace.
[time=2121] The message, selfish ambition, intense jealousy lead to out of control actions which affect our prayers and blind us from the fact that we are cheating on God, dating the world, so knock it off and give yourself entirely to God.
[time=2134] As the band comes up, they're going to play.
[time=2141] I'm going to have you guys come and get the elements for communion.
[time=2145] And then I'm going to come back and we're going to talk about seven through 10 as a response.
[time=2151] As what I think James and I think what God is calling us to do, if there's things that we're doing that are leading us away from the cross.
[time=2158] [MUSIC - 44 seconds]
[time=2205] Thanks guys.
[time=2208] As the table is open, you can come on up and grab the elements and then sit back down.
[time=2215] And then we'll talk through what we're going to do, but you guys can start coming up and grabbing the elements.
[time=2221] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 66 seconds]
[time=2302] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=2362] [MUSIC - 39 seconds]
[time=2419] Oh, how he loves us, oh, how he loves us, oh, how he loves us, oh, how he loves us.
[time=2446] Number seven, James chapter four, he says, "Submit yourselves, therefore it's a God."
[time=2452] He goes through all these verses about fighting, quarreling, and your prayers are selfish, you're being selfish, things you're doing, you're hitting away from God and you're heading towards the world and he's saying, "Come back to God, stop dating the world, stop going
[time=2468] after those pleasures and those things that you think you want, because they're going to leave you empty, because God is a jealous lover, and he deserves our total allegiance."
[time=2478] And so this is kind of James's heart, we just kind of see it where he says, "Submit yourselves,
[time=2484] therefore to God, stop going that way, turn around, come back to God, give in to God,
[time=2493] surrender to God all your selfish ambitions, your intense jealousy, and let go of trying to control everything, and trust fully and completely in God."
[time=2504] And he continues, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
[time=2508] Don't let these passions, don't let these warring inside of you, these passions that war inside of you, resist them, fight against them, choose righteousness."
[time=2519] And God promises that Satan will flee.
[time=2523] He says, "Drone near to God and he will draw near to you one step home, and God's coming,
[time=2531] just like in the story, like the father of the prodigal son who stands ready and waiting
[time=2538] to welcome back his children who turn from their sinful ways." In that story, the father took off running when he saw his child, and we turn, who do
[time=2553] you think's running to us?
[time=2556] Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you.
[time=2560] Cleanse your hands exterior.
[time=2563] The things that are coming from within are out here, cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify internal your hearts.
[time=2572] You double-minded.
[time=2573] And that word double-minded takes us back to the beginning of James where he wants us, he's calling us to single devotion to our God who is singular in his commitment to us.
[time=2587] Be wretched and mourn and weep.
[time=2591] Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.
[time=2597] This is serious.
[time=2600] Don't ignore sin.
[time=2602] Don't ignore that little chip in the paint.
[time=2606] Tomorrow it's a little chip, and a year from now it's a big old problem.
[time=2612] Don't ignore it.
[time=2613] He takes it very seriously.
[time=2615] What how we live for God matters.
[time=2619] Bring it before the Lord in repentance and humility and experience the cleansing work of the Spirit.
[time=2625] That's what it's about, right?
[time=2629] And then the last verse, verse 10, this is beautiful, humble yourselves before the Lord.
[time=2636] Give up this stuff, humble yourselves, and he will exalt you.
[time=2644] He will lift you up.
[time=2647] He will carry you.
[time=2648] He will bring you back.
[time=2649] He will make you whole.
[time=2650] He will lift you up.
[time=2652] So as the band continues to play, I just want you to right where you're at, right in your seats, hold on to those elements and just think through.
[time=2661] What are some things happening in your heart and your mind and your life?
[time=2665] What are some things where you're taking small steps away from God towards the things of the world?
[time=2671] Are there things in your life you're stepping away from, towards away from God?
[time=2676] What is going on?
[time=2677] Just take some time and your own time just to repent of those things humbly before God
[time=2684] and he will lift you up.
[time=2685] When you're ready, you can take the elements, the body, and the blood broken and spilled for you.
[time=2690] Your blood speaks a better word than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth.
[time=2712] This righteousness for me stands in my defense, Jesus it's your blood.
[time=2722] Your blood speaks a better word than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth.
[time=2735] This righteousness for me stands in my defense, Jesus it's your blood.
[time=2744] Your blood speaks a better word than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth.
[time=2953] Your praise you for the blood. Your praise you for the blood. Your praise you for the blood.
[time=2983] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]

[time=3313] You are hope, you are hope, you have covered all my sin.
[time=3324] You are peace, you are peace when my fear is crippling.
[time=3329] You are true, you are true even in my own journey.
[time=3335] You are joy, you are joy, you are the reason that I say.
[time=3340] You are light, you are light when the death has lost its theme.
[time=3352] Hello, I'm running to your eyes.
[time=3359] The riches of your love will always be enough.
