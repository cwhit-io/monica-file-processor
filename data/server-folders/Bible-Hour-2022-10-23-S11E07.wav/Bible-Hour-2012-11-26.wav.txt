[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=33] It's great to have all of you with us today.
[time=36] We're thankful each and every week that we get to spend with you, bringing you the life-changing eternity, altering truth of God's word.
[time=45] And we mean that.
[time=45] That's why we teach the Bible.
[time=47] That's why we make such a big deal about the scriptures.
[time=50] We believe it can change your life.
[time=53] And today, you're gonna hear a message, the last message in our series from the book of James.
[time=58] We've been doing an overview study of the book of James, a chapter a week.
[time=63] And we come to the fifth and final chapter today.
[time=66] And in the context of chapter five, you're gonna hear us talking about the way a true believer, a genuine Christian, approaches and handles their money.
[time=78] Kind of the mindset of a genuinely redeemed person and their thought and their view of the resources that God has given them.
[time=88] And you'll hear me talk about as our own.
[time=91] In the message, you'll hear me talk about this Christmas and Black Hawk's commitment to try and raise above and beyond our normal offering, an enormous amount of money for young ladies over in India who find themselves caught in the sex trafficking industry.
[time=109] We have partnered with an organization called as our own.
[time=113] And as our own is a phenomenal group of people who dedicate themselves to not only freeing young women from the sex trade industry.
[time=123] It's a billion dollar industry and it ruins and captures and demeans, not only young women, but even eventually young children.
[time=133] And we're trying to do our best to bring freedom, to literally bring redemption to young women's lives.
[time=139] And as our own, they not only free them, but then they educate them and they clothe them and they love them and they find a way to give them a life.
[time=149] And our hope is that we could, as a church, and I wanna say to you, that you could, as part of our family and our viewing audience, maybe you could contribute this December to this effort.
[time=160] Keep watching on Sunday mornings, go to our website and learn more about as our own and join us in what we're calling redeeming Christmas.
[time=169] All of us at Blackhawk are prayerfully considering taking significant chunks of what we would normally spend on Christmas gifts this year and putting it aside and giving it as a gift to bring freedom and hope and life to those young women far, far away in India who find themselves today in the chains and the bondage of slavery.
[time=194] So join us, prayerfully think about a significant gift this year to Blackhawk as we redeem Christmas and care for those and free, literally bring freedom to those far, far away.
[time=208] God bless you.
[time=209] Thank you so much for tuning in.
[time=211] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=213] (gentle music)
[time=223] [MUSIC - 245 seconds]
[time=481] Acts chapter four says this.
[time=484] Jesus is the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.
[time=492] Salvation is found in no one else, for there's no other name under heaven given to mankind by which he must be saved.
[time=501] In Ephesians chapter two, it says consequently, you are no longer full runners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God, members of his household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.
[time=523] In him, the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple of the Lord.
[time=531] And in him, you two are being built together to become a dwelling place in which God lives by his spirit.
[time=540] You may be seated where you're at.
[time=545] We're gonna sing another song together, a song that makes a great prayer this morning that just declares that God is the source of our hope and our strength and that we find rest in him.
[time=560] So as we sing this song, I invite you to bow your heads and just take a posture of prayer, maybe hold your hands out on your lap in front of you and just invite God to be all the things that we're about to sing, our hope, our strength and our rest.
[time=593] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 51 seconds]
[time=653] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 243 seconds]
[time=906] (gentle music) - Okay, so I was 21 years old.
[time=916] I'm a senior in college.
[time=918] I'm going to the master's college.
[time=920] By this time, I had come to know Christ, started out college in a couple of different places, but ended up at the master's college, Christian College, Southern California, and we're on a missions trip.
[time=931] There's 50 of us college kids, and we're going to New York City, and we're going to New York City.
[time=937] It's the summer of 1986, and they're gonna reopen the Statue of Liberty, and the city of New York is crawling with people, and we're going there to work with a church, in Northern kind of North Manhattan, Manhattan Bible Church, and they're expecting close to 500 high school kids who are gonna be coming to Manhattan Bible Church to take part in this huge missions experience in New York City, and they got 50 college kids.
[time=970] We're gonna end up dividing up and taking small groups of 10 or 15 high school kids, and individual college age leaders are gonna be responsible for taking these high school kids in groups of 10, 12, 13, 14, all over New York City to do different missions projects.
[time=989] They're gonna take high school kids to Battery Park, and they're gonna take high school kids to the 42nd Street Library, and they're gonna take high school kids to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, they're gonna take high school kids to Wall Street, they're gonna take high school kids to Columbus Circle, and they're gonna do outdoor evangelism, and they're gonna do all kinds of worship, and they're gonna do all kinds of miming, and all kinds of stuff to draw attention to the gospel, and so we get there a week early to just get ready for this, and about three days before 500 kids show up, it dawns on us that nobody knows from Northern Manhattan, nobody knows how to get to these places,
[time=1032] and we're like, oh my goodness.
[time=1036] So I remember we go hustling down to the local subway, that we buy hundreds, hundreds of dollars of tokens, and we go into this gym at this church, and we get, it's before cell phones, and there was no GPS, and there was no map quest, it was just paper directions, subway directions, and 50 college kids going, okay, you're gonna be the battery park team, and you're gonna be the library team, and you're gonna be the Columbus Circle team, and you're gonna be the Wall Street team, and we're there with marksalots and highlighters trying to figure out how to get from Northern Manhattan on the New York subway system to all these places, and we studied, and we studied, and we studied, and we traced, and we quizzed, and then 24 hours before the high school kids get there, we got up one morning early, got our tokens, and everybody sat out to the subway station in Northern Manhattan, and we rode the subway, we got off subways and transferred to other subways, and we had our maps, and we did it again, and again, and again, and again, for that entire day and night, we came back to Northern Manhattan, went back to our spot, came back, went back, came back, went back, transfers, A train, one train, three train, L train, H train, blue train, orange train, I'm telling you, I took my family to New York City three years ago for spring break in 2010, and my kids were like looking at me going, "Dude, how do you know the subway system?" (audience laughing) I'm telling you, I am an absolute to this day, expert,
[time=1135] I could take any of you anywhere in New York City on a subway, because I studied and studied and studied and studied and passed, no high school kids got lost, no group got left behind, a whole week of ministry every day on the New York subway system, we passed the test of the New York subway, and tests, my friends, are really, really important.
[time=1164] They say a lot about who we are, they say a lot about what we know, they say a lot about what we're aware of, they say a lot about what we've taken in.
[time=1173] High school and junior high kids will be taking finals in the middle of December, college students all around the country will be as well, doctors sit for their boards, lawyers sit for the bar, psychologists and plumbers and contractors and teachers and nurses and retail champions and great athletes and musicians and artists, nobody, listen, nobody gets to be anything of merit or value
[time=1206] without passing a few very important, say it, tests.
[time=1211] And this, my friends, is what the book of James
[time=1218] has been about.
[time=1219] The book of James has been about a series of tests, exams, if you will, giving you and I the opportunity to put up against these tests, the validity and the genuineness of our faith.
[time=1235] And now we come this morning to the end of our study, we come to the fifth chapter of James, I hope you'll open your Bibles this morning to James chapter five, if you don't have a Bible, then look on.
[time=1246] Please, with somebody nearby, James chapter five and how true believers pass the test of four things, money, suffering, prayer and rescue.
[time=1262] Four final tests in this book of exams, known as the Epistle of James, how true believers pass the test of money, suffering, prayer and rescue.
[time=1275] Think about all that we've seen in the book of James from chapter one and trials and temptations to chapter two and the treatment of those in poverty or those in need to chapter three and the use of our tongue to chapter four and friendship with the world.
[time=1294] The whole book of James has been a series of exams, tests of true saving faith, why?
[time=1302] Why, just to be clear, one more time, why is it that James felt the need to lay out for this young growing church, the series of tests?
[time=1312] Well, the answer is clear because the church was at its beginning starting to be infiltrated by fakes and frauds, people who claimed Christianity, people who came to the gathering, people who sat in the pews, people who sang the songs, if you will, but when it came to the everyday of their life, when it came to what they really valued, when it came to how they chose, when it came to the way they lived out their faith, it didn't match up.
[time=1350] It wasn't showing itself to be genuine.
[time=1355] And so James gives us from the beginning of chapter one all the way to the end of chapter five.
[time=1359] He gives us tests after test after test so that you and I can match up our proclamation with the reality of our lives and our thinking.
[time=1370] And so the testing of our faith continues here in chapter five, regarding money, we'll start, we'll jump right in here, regarding money, the very beginning of five, I'll draw your attention here in a moment to the first six verses.
[time=1383] There was a way in which genuine believers were to approach and handle and view money, regarding money.
[time=1395] Now, before we get into that, I wanna just say this, the Bible talks a lot about money.
[time=1401] Have you figured this out yet?
[time=1402] The Bible says a lot about finances.
[time=1407] The Bible speaks a great deal about our view of and our approach to resources.
[time=1416] Almost 2,500 references in the scripture to the issue of how you approach and view money, 2,500.
[time=1426] That's three times as many references to the topic of love.
[time=1431] And you say, or I say anybody who hears that would say, well, why?
[time=1437] Glad you asked.
[time=1439] And it's very consistent with what we've been seeing in James because our view of money is a great test.
[time=1447] It is a revealer.
[time=1449] Why so many references on money in the Bible?
[time=1452] Because nothing, and I've been at this for a while, I can second this, I can say this is true.
[time=1458] Nothing more clearly reveals.
[time=1461] The true condition of a person's spiritual heart than the way they view money and material possessions.
[time=1468] Many who claim to be followers of Jesus Christ invalidate their claim to genuine saving faith through their indulgent, self-serving, materialistic, pleasure-driven lifestyles.
[time=1483] Real life, everyday choices show them not to be followers of Christ, but instead followers of money.
[time=1490] Followers of wealth, followers of the desire to always have more.
[time=1494] And here's James.
[time=1497] Here's James, the half brother of Jesus in Jerusalem and Christianity is on the move and he knows that this new movement of faith in Christ will only survive when and if it finds a way to stand in contrast to the culture.
[time=1516] He knew then what we know to be true today, that real Christianity, the kind that really makes a difference in its culture is always on any issue going to be counter-culture.
[time=1531] And James knew as did God as he inspires James to write, James knew that the opulence and indulgence of the Roman world that controlled society would test the reality of this new church's faith.
[time=1549] And what he shows you here in verses one to six is how true believers don't approach money.
[time=1558] What he shows you here in verses one to six is a clear look into the way the unsaved, the ungodly approach finances and resources.
[time=1569] This is a warning in these verses as well as a test.
[time=1574] So as it relates to the genuinely saved regarding money, three things, I hope you'll take note of these as it relates to the genuinely saved regarding money, they, number one, they don't uselessly hoard it.
[time=1593] They don't uselessly hoard it.
[time=1595] Come now you rich, verse one.
[time=1597] Come now you rich, weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you.
[time=1605] And the rich are going, wait a minute, I thought all my wealth was gonna make me happy.
[time=1610] And he says, no, no, no.
[time=1611] He says weep, he says, come now you rich, weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you.
[time=1617] Your riches have rotted underline that word.
[time=1621] Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth eaten.
[time=1626] Your gold and your silver have rusted underline that word.
[time=1631] And their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire.
[time=1640] It is in the last days that you have stored up for yourselves, that you have stored up your treasures.
[time=1646] Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields and which has been withheld by you, cries out against you.
[time=1655] And the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the Lord of Sabbath.
[time=1660] You have lived luxuriously on the earth and let a life of want and pleasure.
[time=1665] You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
[time=1668] You have condemned and put to death the righteous man.
[time=1671] He does not resist you.
[time=1673] There you have it, six verses that give the one who proclaims faith in Christ an opportunity to test their faith against a godly standard.
[time=1684] Number one, they don't uselessly hoard it.
[time=1688] Your riches have rotted, your gold and silver have rusted verses two and three.
[time=1694] Here's the bottom line on these two verses, verses two and three.
[time=1697] Whatever amount of resource God has given you, here's the bottom line.
[time=1701] Whatever amount of money God has given you, whether it's a little or a lot, doesn't matter.
[time=1706] He hasn't given it to you in order for you to hide it under your bed.
[time=1712] He hasn't given it to you in order for you to pad your accounts beyond food, clothing and a roof over your head.
[time=1720] The true believer's money is invested.
[time=1723] The true Christian's money is spent.
[time=1726] It's used in kingdom endeavors.
[time=1730] The genuine believer applies available resources to that which will not rust and that which will not rot.
[time=1738] And all of your toys and mine, all of our stuff, you and I both know it, all of it will rust and all of it will rot.
[time=1749] He who dies with the most toys doesn't win.
[time=1754] He just has a larger estate tax, I think.
[time=1761] It's not about what we can acquire.
[time=1766] It's not about all that we can stack up.
[time=1770] It is about a God who has graciously given you and me resources.
[time=1774] Yes, to live on, but then beyond that, how do you spend it?
[time=1779] What are you investing in?
[time=1781] What are you giving to?
[time=1782] As it relates to the genuinely saved regarding money,
[time=1788] they don't uselessly hoard it.
[time=1790] Secondly, they don't unjustly make it.
[time=1794] Please write that down, they don't unjustly make money.
[time=1797] Says there in verse four, "Behold, the pay of the laborers who mow your fields." You could insert there anything in any way, in any shape or form, somebody who you owe money to, somebody who works for you, somebody who does a service for you, somebody who does something at your request, somebody who financially, as it is, you're kind of responsible for, he makes it very clear here in verse four, the genuine believer never mistreats anyone financially.
[time=1832] You don't do it.
[time=1833] You give them what they're due.
[time=1837] You maybe even give them more, but you give them what they're due, and you give them what they're due on time, and you give them what they're due with a generous spirit.
[time=1846] Whether it's $10 or $10,000, the believer pays what is owed.
[time=1852] They never pad their own financial pocket on the back or labor of another.
[time=1857] Makes sense?
[time=1860] It's just not how it works.
[time=1862] Believers in this arena are to have the utmost of integrity and honesty.
[time=1868] Genuine believers don't uselessly hoard it because they see a kingdom opportunity.
[time=1874] Genuine believers don't unjustly make it on the backs of others because believers don't do that to people.
[time=1881] And thirdly, as it relates to the genuinely saved, regarding money, genuine Christians don't self-indulgently spend their money.
[time=1893] True believers don't self-indulgently spend their money.
[time=1898] You have lived luxuriously on the earth, verse five, and led a life of wanton pleasure.
[time=1905] You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
[time=1910] This verse is not in any way, hear me.
[time=1915] This verse is not in any way saying that with your resources, there is absolutely no room at all in your life to experience any kind of pleasure.
[time=1927] This verse is not saying that as a believer who has received resources from God, you can't go somewhere nice.
[time=1933] It's not saying that.
[time=1935] What it's saying is that there are people who claim to be believers and upon the receipt of God's blessing, they have fattened their hearts and they have become absolutely and utterly focused on, completely and utterly devoted to wanton pleasure and luxury.
[time=1956] And he says it's not the way it works with those who truly love him.
[time=1961] There is to be, if you will, not a fattened heart, but a lean, a lean heart when it comes to our willingness to part with that which we can part with.
[time=1975] When it comes to our willingness to get, a fattened heart stands in absolute contrast to a sacrificial heart.
[time=1985] And what I want for you, what God's word wants for you, what a true believer possesses is a lean sacrificial heart that looks at and sees people and opportunities as a chance to share their resources.
[time=2001] And whether you get something wantonly pleasurable or not, no, no, no, the believer, the true Christian looks at resources and looks at life and its opportunities and makes sure that at the heart level, because there's your, where your heart is there, your treasure is as well, the genuine believer is utterly and absolutely devoted to a lean sacrificial approach.
[time=2028] It's why we're trying to encourage you this Christmas season.
[time=2032] It's why we're doing redeeming Christmas.
[time=2034] It's why I think God led us to the unbelievable team of people at as our own as we partner with them to try and bring literal redemption to these gals in the red light district of India, to these gals stuck in slavery.
[time=2050] These gals who, as our own, comes in and rescues and educates and clothes and loves and they give these gals a future.
[time=2061] And so we ask, hey, maybe you take, somebody asked me yesterday and I just kind of spelled that out for them.
[time=2069] I think it was helpful.
[time=2070] We've got regular giving, just normal regular giving that all of us who call black hot comb, I hope continue to sacrificially be a part of.
[time=2080] Then there is every December, this idea of us doing something really special for a redemptive cause.
[time=2087] There have been many over the last few years.
[time=2089] And so there would be secondly, this idea of just above and beyond giving.
[time=2094] Just sacrificial above and beyond normal giving.
[time=2096] Think of this one and think about you doing Christmas like you always have because that's how we've always done this.
[time=2103] We've done regular giving and above and beyond giving.
[time=2106] And now this year we're asking you to do that.
[time=2110] And then we're asking you on top of the above and beyond to consider how you're going to approach gifts.
[time=2117] And many of you have prayerfully thought this through as individually, even as families, I know of many who are thinking about just really moving away this year from gifts all together, getting the cards and sending them out and honestly tracking and thinking through how much would we have spent.
[time=2138] And then taking that lump sum and putting it on top of this already set aside above and beyond number.
[time=2146] And that's why in our minds we're hoping and praying that maybe we might as a family be able to do even more than we've done in the past.
[time=2154] But this idea of the pleasure and the fun of gifts and we're not making Christmas gifts evil.
[time=2163] It's not our intent.
[time=2164] We're just saying, hey, what a great opportunity for us to think about how we could this year maybe sacrifice.
[time=2171] Move away from any kind of self-indulgence and take all that money that we could spend on gifts and give it to those who might be literally freed.
[time=2181] And so that's our hope and it's right here in line with what we see in James 5.
[time=2185] We don't uselessly hoard it, we don't unjustly make it and we don't self-indulgently spend it.
[time=2193] A great test.
[time=2194] A great opportunity for you and I to think about the way in which we approach and view money.
[time=2198] Next test here in chapter five, let's keep going.
[time=2201] Regarding suffering, regarding suffering.
[time=2206] I wanna draw your attention to verses seven through 11 and before we get to the text, let me just say this.
[time=2212] I view this passage here in the middle of chapter five as a test of pain.
[time=2219] This is really where we come to the test that the true believer has to face, the test of pain.
[time=2226] And it's not cruel, it's not cruel at all.
[time=2229] It is actually reality for you and for me.
[time=2234] In a broken, not at all what God intended it to be world, there is heartache and trial.
[time=2242] You can't get away from it, you can't get around it, you can't avoid it.
[time=2246] Jesus said in John 1633, he said in this world, I love how he said this world because there is a world where there won't be, amen,
[time=2259] but he said in this world, you will have tribulation.
[time=2264] Jesus said in no uncertain terms, in this world, you will get bumped, you will get hit, you will get tested, you will get tried, you will get absolutely dragged through the mud.
[time=2278] It will hurt, it will be confusing, it will at times feel hopeless.
[time=2284] In this world, Jesus said, you will have tribulation and the Bible is filled with instruction and encouragement.
[time=2291] Listen, on how it is that the one who has truly placed his or her faith in Christ is to respond to the suffering and to the difficulty Jesus said would be ours.
[time=2304] And here in James five, seven to 11, James reminds us that with the genuine believer regarding suffering, they will what?
[time=2316] Well, look at verse seven.
[time=2319] Therefore, and I guarantee you most of you
[time=2325] in the room won't like this, but we're gonna just say it and we're gonna all own it and dive in and do our best to move in this direction.
[time=2333] Therefore, be what?
[time=2334] Say it, church, say it again.
[time=2336] Does it say therefore fix it?
[time=2341] Yes or no?
[time=2343] It says therefore, be what?
[time=2346] Brethren, until the coming of the Lord.
[time=2351] Does it say fix it?
[time=2353] Yes or no?
[time=2355] It says be what?
[time=2357] It says be patient for two weeks?
[time=2358] Yes or no?
[time=2359] It says be patient until what?
[time=2361] So the coming of the Lord gets connected
[time=2367] to your patient endurance of pain.
[time=2372] Wow, the farmer waits for the precious produce
[time=2379] of the soil.
[time=2380] That's your salvation coming to fruition.
[time=2383] The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil being patient about it until it gets the early and late reigns.
[time=2392] You too be, say it, church, patient.
[time=2395] Strengthen your hearts for the end of your trial.
[time=2400] Nope.
[time=2401] Strengthen your hearts for the coming of the who, said of the Lord, for the coming of the Lord is near.
[time=2408] Do not complain against each other so that you yourselves may not be judged.
[time=2414] Behold, the judge is standing right at the door.
[time=2417] As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
[time=2424] And no one listened.
[time=2427] We count those blessed who, here's a big word, endured.
[time=2432] Endured isn't fixing.
[time=2434] Enduring isn't altering.
[time=2438] Enduring is enduring.
[time=2440] Enduring is being patient.
[time=2442] Enduring is getting up day after day after day, even if it hasn't been what, fixed.
[time=2450] They endured.
[time=2453] You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lord's dealings that the Lord is at the end of the day full of compassion and is merciful.
[time=2467] Church, listen, here's the bottom line on this one.
[time=2470] In a section that's all about suffering and trials, James doesn't once mention the specific trial or any immediate earthly tangible relief from it.
[time=2483] Not one.
[time=2485] He doesn't say, here's how to make your cancer better.
[time=2491] He doesn't say, here's how to correct your disrespectful wife.
[time=2495] He doesn't say, here's a way to alter or exact revenge on a mean-spirited friend who's hurt you.
[time=2501] He says with regard to your suffering and mind, he says, wait.
[time=2507] He says, wait, wait it out.
[time=2515] We need, we need this truth today so desperately,
[time=2525] so desperately, this all flies in the face of what one of my friends calls our Advil Christianity.
[time=2532] And I'll just let you think about that phrase.
[time=2536] Just this idea that the second something hurts, God's will must be for me to knock back three,
[time=2548] you know, every four hours, so I can be freed of this difficulty.
[time=2556] We need this so desperately.
[time=2558] Wait patiently for the Lord to come back.
[time=2563] What's that mean?
[time=2563] It means this, a genuine Christian, I hope you'll write this down, a genuine Christian is so sold on long-term relief that short-term heartache loses its punch.
[time=2574] The genuine believer is so devoted to and so sold
[time=2580] on the great value of the fact that there will be a day when my Christ and my Lord returns, long-term relief that short-term heartache loses its punch.
[time=2592] This really, really makes sense as you look at the immediate context that James has written in.
[time=2600] Guess what the suffering of the early church was?
[time=2604] Guess what was starting to happen to them on a daily basis in the everyday life of the early church believer?
[time=2612] It's a thing called persecution.
[time=2615] They were beginning to be slaughtered, they were beginning to be beaten, they were beginning to be taken away from their families, they were beginning to be tortured, they were beginning to be severely persecuted.
[time=2628] And in the midst of severe persecution, guess what they realized and what they realized is the same thing you and I should realize, although we don't face what they faced, the correlation is exact.
[time=2643] What they realized in the face of severe persecution is that it wasn't going away.
[time=2649] They realized that tomorrow it would be back.
[time=2653] They realized that next week it might even get worse.
[time=2656] They realized that month after month after month, they were going to be persecuted.
[time=2666] It wasn't about something somehow removing the pain.
[time=2671] It was about enduring.
[time=2675] The cancer can come back.
[time=2681] The friend, the friend might just continue to mistreat you.
[time=2687] The marriage will always have its challenges.
[time=2691] The job is never secure.
[time=2694] The son or daughter make drift away in this world.
[time=2698] You will have heartache.
[time=2701] So watch this.
[time=2703] This is very powerful and it's very convicting.
[time=2706] And it's not, I'm not saying just convicting for your sake as I explain this to you here in the next couple of minutes, you'll see how convicting it is for me.
[time=2716] So watch this.
[time=2718] Guess what?
[time=2720] The persecuted, boldly faithful early church looked forward to.
[time=2725] Guess what they looked forward to?
[time=2730] Guess what they yearned for?
[time=2732] Guess what they talked about all the time.
[time=2736] They wrote about it and they sang about it.
[time=2739] Guess what was on the heart and mind of the early church?
[time=2742] This boldly faithful, uncompromised group of people they looked forward to?
[time=2748] The second coming of the Lord?
[time=2751] They looked forward to the second coming of the Lord.
[time=2757] Guess what?
[time=2760] Guess what the affluent?
[time=2762] Guess what the affluent, indulgent church
[time=2770] with not a bold but instead compromised faith hardly ever talks about, teaches about, or yearns for, answer the second coming of the Lord.
[time=2783] Why?
[time=2789] Why aren't we consumed with the second coming of the Lord?
[time=2796] And you know what?
[time=2799] You might be, you might be.
[time=2805] And if you are, you are an example to me because I tend not to be.
[time=2812] And if that disappoints you or if that concerns you, you should be.
[time=2819] I'm admitting that to you today.
[time=2822] Because watch this, you know why I'm not?
[time=2825] And you know why many of us in the room aren't consumed with that because people consumed with their money, people consumed with getting and gaining, people consumed with their worldly stuff, people consumed with somehow trying to get more, have more, live a better life, want relief from their pain now
[time=2851] because they live for the gain of today instead of the hope of tomorrow.
[time=2857] Make sense?
[time=2859] Too many of us have adopted an advil.
[time=2864] Christianity.
[time=2866] And in that we become immediate in our focus.
[time=2870] Not long term, not eternal.
[time=2873] We actually get duped into sort of living life for now.
[time=2880] And the Bible says right here in James, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's endurance.
[time=2885] You just keep enduring.
[time=2887] It isn't about relief, it's about faithfulness.
[time=2891] And even if no relief comes until Jesus returns, this is the kind of mindset he wants from us.
[time=2898] And a lot of this comes back to what Jesse taught last week.
[time=2903] A lot of this mindset comes from you and I becoming friends with the what?
[time=2907] With the world.
[time=2909] And the more of a friendship we have with the world, the less of a friendship we have with him, the less prone you are and the less prone I am to wait patiently in the midst of absolute heartache.
[time=2923] Let's keep going.
[time=2925] James 5, next test is the test regarding prayer
[time=2932] as it relates to the genuinely saved.
[time=2935] Guess what the genuinely saved do as it relates to prayer?
[time=2940] They what?
[time=2941] They pray.
[time=2946] Oh, friends, listen, the genuinely saved.
[time=2950] Those who live in proximity to him,
[time=2956] those who live with this deep and growing trust in him, those who live in the presence of God, all my friends, true believers, have as almost an auto-reflex mechanism.
[time=2971] It's just, are we teaching our kids this?
[time=2974] It's just, it's just what they do.
[time=2977] It's just the first thing on their mind.
[time=2979] It's just how they respond.
[time=2981] It is this automatic posture of the heart in the face of anything and everything I need to talk to God about this.
[time=2992] I need to praise him for this.
[time=2994] I need to petition him for this.
[time=3004] In our passage here in James 5, prayer is encouraged and assumed in almost every setting.
[time=3011] Look at verse 13, "Is any among you suffering?
[time=3014] Is anyone among you suffering?
[time=3016] Then he must pray." Verse 13 brings the emphasis to individual prayer.
[time=3023] Are you in trouble?
[time=3024] Are you, are you suffering?
[time=3026] Are you experiencing heartache?
[time=3028] Is there something not right with you?
[time=3030] You, he says, "You pray." So genuine believers do.
[time=3033] They put, they get on their knees and they beg God and they communicate with God.
[time=3038] And they get reminded of God's will and they pray and ask God for strength.
[time=3044] And is any among you suffering?
[time=3046] Pray, there's individual prayer.
[time=3048] Look at verses 14 and 15.
[time=3050] Is anyone among you sick?
[time=3052] Then he must call for the elders.
[time=3054] Now the elders come into the picture.
[time=3056] So there's individual prayer.
[time=3058] There's elders praying.
[time=3060] Is any among you sick?
[time=3061] And he must call for the elders of the church.
[time=3063] And they are to pray over him or her, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.
[time=3069] And that prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick and the Lord will raise him up.
[time=3076] And if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him.
[time=3079] Quick explanation here for you.
[time=3081] I think it helped a lot of folks first hour.
[time=3083] I wanna make sure you hear me say this.
[time=3085] Contrary to the English rendering here, and I know maybe for some of you, years and years and years, you've been thinking or you've been taught that this has to do with physical sickness.
[time=3098] And we do as elders pray, oh, we pray.
[time=3103] We gather as elders and we pray for the physically sick.
[time=3108] We believe that's a good thing to do.
[time=3111] And I do believe, I do believe that there are times
[time=3117] when God brings physical sickness.
[time=3121] As a result of sin, I do believe that.
[time=3126] I want you to understand that this verse in the Greek, and I don't ever bring you Greek stuff.
[time=3132] You know me.
[time=3133] I don't bring you Greek stuff unless it's pertinent.
[time=3135] And I want you to know that the Greek word here for sick isn't the Greek word for physically sick.
[time=3142] It's the Greek word for spiritually sick.
[time=3147] Most all renderings of this word in the Greek have to do with somebody who spiritually isn't doing well.
[time=3156] They are really, really struggling.
[time=3159] They are really, really floundering.
[time=3161] They are really spiritually in trouble.
[time=3164] And James 5 says here, if you're spiritually sick, if things aren't right, if things aren't going well, if you're just completely lost in this spiritual fog and you know you're in trouble, call for the elders and let them come and pray.
[time=3185] And it's interesting when you read this, read these verses with physically sick in mind and then read these verses with spiritually sick in mind.
[time=3198] And look at how much sense it makes when you start to look at it from a spiritual perspective.
[time=3206] Is any among you spiritually sick?
[time=3209] Then he must call for the elders of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
[time=3214] And the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick and the Lord will raise him up.
[time=3223] And if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him.
[time=3228] Just a very interesting perspective.
[time=3231] And again, you may have heard it different over the years in my studies and in my look at this, it really is actually encouraging to see it from that perspective.
[time=3242] There's individual prayer in 13, the elders are to pray in 15.
[time=3248] In 16, the church gets involved.
[time=3251] It says in 16, look what it says and we're gonna close here.
[time=3254] It says in 16, therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.
[time=3260] The effective prayer of a righteous man accomplishes much.
[time=3264] True believers pray.
[time=3268] And then lastly, as it regards rescue, look at verses 19 and 20.
[time=3273] My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth and one turns him back, let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.
[time=3291] I want you to stand quietly where you're at.
[time=3293] Let me just explain that to you as we go this morning.
[time=3297] Who is this, listen, who is this one who has wandered?
[time=3302] Who is this individual here that James is referring to?
[time=3306] Some think it's a believer, but again, I don't think that's at all consistent with the text and the entire book, the entire book has been talking about those who think that they are, who might proclaim that they are, but who really aren't.
[time=3322] And what James is saying to you and me is this, they're sitting with you, you know them.
[time=3330] They sing the songs with you.
[time=3334] They may even say that they're in, but there will be a day when you will see them and they will be finally.
[time=3341] It may be this week, it could be next month, but you're gonna see him or her and they're going, something's gonna happen and they're gonna show their true colors and they're gonna start to walk.
[time=3354] And who among you who are truly saved will be willing to go in love and in honor and with vigilance and turn him or her?
[time=3368] Obviously with God's help.
[time=3370] And in God turning them, in God using you to turn them back, save a sinner, a New Testament word in the Greek almost always used for those outside the faith, to turn a sinner from his or her way.
[time=3386] And so I wanna just leave you with this, who needs your help today?
[time=3391] Who needs your help today?
[time=3394] Who you know him, you know her and they're moving in a direction and they're starting to show their true colors.
[time=3400] And it's not going well and maybe, just maybe God has appointed you for such a time as this to pursue them and to love them and to be with them and to serve them and in the loving of them and the serving of them and the speaking with them and the praying for them or maybe even with them he uses you to turn them back and save them and cover a multitude of sins that could happen if in fact they continued to wander.
[time=3432] Thank God for the tests of true salvation and thank God for the times we've had these last several weeks to consider these great truths.
[time=3440] Will you pray with me Father in Heaven, we leave this place today?
[time=3443] Sufficiently, I believe, encouraged and warned.
[time=3448] God you have given us reason to pause and consider the reality of our faith.
[time=3454] And oh God, we pray and ask today that you would give us courage and integrity as we look at the reality of our lives.
[time=3463] As we read back through James, may we be willing to match up not the intentions of our living,
[time=3474] but the reality of our living to that which you say, up and against that which you say represents true and saving faith.
[time=3484] Oh God, be with us as we go.
[time=3486] Bring us back together again soon if that be your will in your son's precious name, we pray.
[time=3490] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=3513] (upbeat music)
[time=3543] You
