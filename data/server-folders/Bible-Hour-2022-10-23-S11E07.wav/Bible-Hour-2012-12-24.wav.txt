[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It's great to be with you, and as you watch this, we're headed toward the end of the year.
[time=38] For most of you, it's Sunday, December 30th, and one more day left in 2012.
[time=46] And really that means two things for us, two things that we wanna make sure you know about.
[time=51] And that is this, before year end, the 31st, or even in the first week of January, I think we would be very, very open to you, any of you, participating with us in what we call our year end gifts that go.
[time=68] If you wanna come by the office, if you wanna put something in the mail, we would love to hear from you.
[time=73] We are trying our very best to raise $200,000, 210 to be exact, and that $210,000 is going to go to India
[time=85] in our efforts to free, literally free, 44 young girls from the red light districts of India, from the brothels of that place, where the sex trade is thriving, and women caught in that industry are giving birth to little ones, and those little ones are growing up, if you can even imagine what that must be like.
[time=109] And these little girls that are born in the brothels, we're trying to save and rescue them, 95% of them will follow in their mother's footsteps, caught in the darkness and iniquity of that industry, and we wanna help free them.
[time=124] So we're literally partnering with a group called As Our Own, a great organization to bring freedom and health and education and a future to these little girls growing up in the red light districts of the sex trade.
[time=137] So join us in that effort, $4,500 allows for everything a little girl needs for an entire year, and we've been amazed at how God has been moving in our own family, and would love for you to join us in that effort.
[time=152] So again, write a check, send it into Blackhawk Ministries, put gifts that go on the memo, or better yet come by the office and drop something off.
[time=161] We'd love to have your help.
[time=163] Also in January, come and join us on Sunday mornings.
[time=166] As you see here on the screen, we have a great series coming up called Modern Families.
[time=173] Modern Families, today's Modern Family, we believe still needs the ancient truths of God's Word.
[time=179] God's design for how parents and husbands and wives and family issues, how all of that is to play out.
[time=185] God gave us some real direction on that.
[time=187] We're gonna look at that all through the month of January.
[time=190] So come, bring your friends, bring your family, and let's be encouraged as we start this new year in God's Word. Thank you so much for being part of this broadcast.
[time=201] Thank you for your support, for your encouragement over this past year.
[time=204] We can't wait for 2013 and all that God's going to do.
[time=209] Thank you for being a part of it.
[time=211] God bless you, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=214] [MUSIC - 41 seconds]
[time=258] (audience applauding)
[time=271] - Well, good morning, everyone.
[time=279] My name's Corbin, I'm the worship pastor here.
[time=281] I'm so thankful for Chris and Adam who are on staff and we've been working for a while now to put some of these songs together for you this morning.
[time=290] I really think and I hope that this will be a time of worship for all of us.
[time=295] Songs like this, songs about Christ's birth, familiar tunes done in different creative ways.
[time=302] Hopefully we'll tune our hearts to sing the praises of God this morning.
[time=305] He did an amazing, miraculous thing when he broke through heaven and he came to earth.
[time=311] And it's worth singing about and celebrating about.
[time=314] Ah, and here comes my special guest right now.
[time=318] Oh, you can clap for it already.
[time=320] (audience applauding) Way to hear sing, it's gonna be great.
[time=324] If you don't know, this is my middle daughter Viviana and she and I have been working for the last eight weeks or so on a special song and she's gonna sing it for you this morning as her Christmas offering to Jesus today.
[time=337] It's a beautiful song about the wise men, right?
[time=341] She just talked about that yesterday.
[time=343] You know, the wise men, they traveled a really long way expecting to find a king or the son of a king, but instead they found this humble stall and they found this young couple and this small baby that wasn't getting attention or fanfare.
[time=359] But they didn't let that throw them and they chose to worship anyway.
[time=361] Sometimes God moves in unexpected ways and our choice should be like the Magi to worship him even when we aren't expecting the way things will turn out.
[time=370] So Viv, are you ready to sing for him this morning?
[time=373] Okay, I'm gonna sing it for you now.
[time=375] (gentle piano music)
[time=403] [MUSIC - 145 seconds]
[time=574] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 75 seconds]
[time=655] (audience applauding) - Thank God for the good gift to Jesus and what a gift to our whole family.
[time=663] And thank God for the strength He gave you to work eight weeks with your father on that.
[time=670] And thank you for sharing her with us.
[time=673] That was awesome.
[time=675] Really, really great way to start the morning.
[time=677] Good morning everybody, so good to have you with us more music and more worship in a bit.
[time=682] We want to spend some time as a family this morning in the Word of God celebrating this great event.
[time=687] What a great three days we're gonna have today.
[time=689] And then we'll be back tomorrow night, six o'clock.
[time=691] I hope you'll all come.
[time=693] For Christmas Eve, it's a great tradition here and we'd love to have all of you with a 6 p.m.
[time=697] right here for about an hour.
[time=699] And then the following day we'll get to be with family and friends and enjoy celebrating the birth of our Lord.
[time=706] Larry King, CNN commentator, veteran talk show host, said a few years ago, he said I would like to, they were talking about interviews he'd like to do.
[time=715] And Larry King said I'd like to ask Jesus if he was indeed virgin born.
[time=723] Larry King said this, if I could get the answer to that one question, it could quite possibly redefine not only history but my own life, he said.
[time=734] My friends, the maternal, or really more importantly here, the paternal origin of Jesus is a really, really big deal.
[time=746] The foundational truths of a biblical faith rest entirely on the all at once humanity and divinity, the humanity and the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=761] We talk now about the incarnation, all of which begins most importantly with a virgin conception, make a note of that.
[time=770] It all begins with the virgin conception, Matthew 1, 18.
[time=775] Matthew 1, 18, you'll see it there on the screen in the very first chapter of Matthew in this great account.
[time=782] It says here now the birth of Jesus was as follows when his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph before they came together.
[time=793] Before Mary and Joseph were ever one,
[time=799] she was found to be with child.
[time=802] How?
[time=804] By the Holy Spirit, it says.
[time=808] This all begins, as we mentioned, this talk of the incarnation, the great importance of the virgin birth begins most importantly with the virgin conception.
[time=822] And you see it right there in that verse.
[time=824] It does conclude for safe measure with the actual virgin birth.
[time=828] In verses 24 and 25, and Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took Mary as his wife.
[time=837] And we sometimes forget verse 25, but what does it say there?
[time=840] But kept her a what?
[time=841] Say it.
[time=843] Kept her a virgin until she gave birth.
[time=847] Virgin conception, virgin birth, everything as God had designed.
[time=853] It's a really, really big deal.
[time=857] The virgin birth, John MacArthur says, the virgin birth is the underlying assumption of everything scripture says about Jesus.
[time=864] To question the virgin birth is to question Christ's deity, the accuracy and authority of the Bible, and a host of other doctrines found at the very heart of the Christian faith.
[time=874] No issue is more important than the virgin conception to our understanding of who Jesus is.
[time=882] If we deny the virgin conception and birth, we deny Jesus is God.
[time=887] And if we deny Jesus was God, we have both denied and rejected the very essence of Christianity.
[time=896] It is a unique, my friends.
[time=898] It is a unique and very big deal.
[time=903] I was thinking about it this last week, thinking about things that are unique, thinking about how valuable some things are that we determined to be for whatever reason unique.
[time=916] Here's one for you.
[time=917] 1962, they rolled out with this puppy.
[time=921] All the guys in the room just got really excited.
[time=925] In July 2012, just this past summer, this 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO, sold for $35 million.
[time=940] And it's sold for $35 million, not just because it's a great-looking ride.
[time=949] It's sold for $35 million because it's rare, because there were only back in 1962 35 of them, just 35 of those babies made, and it sells for $35 million.
[time=965] Maybe you're familiar with this next work of art, Walking Man, a sculpture by Alberto Gio-Cometi, sold in February of 2010 for what do you think, 20?
[time=978] Any guesses, 30, 40, $15 million?
[time=983] No, try $104 million.
[time=990] That sold for ad auction, $104.3 million.
[time=994] You say, how in the world could something like that cost that much?
[time=999] What they'll tell you is this, it's rare.
[time=1002] There were only six of them, only six of them ever made.
[time=1009] And guys, I'm sorry, I had to throw this in for the gals.
[time=1012] As you shop one last day or day and a half gals, you might want to think about these Levi's.
[time=1017] They're called Levi came out with these a few years ago.
[time=1021] They're called the Spin Levi's.
[time=1025] They commissioned a guy named Damien Hirst to design and produce these jeans, only eight pairs ever made,
[time=1035] and you can buy them for a cool $27,000 pair.
[time=1040] Ladies, get those Visa cards out now.
[time=1045] Pretty rare, pretty unique.
[time=1048] Hey my friends, it's the great truth we get to celebrate this morning of the billions of people born into the human race.
[time=1060] God commissioned only one copy.
[time=1065] Just one to be born from a 15 year old who had never been with a man.
[time=1071] No one ever, only Jesus is conceived in and born of a virgin.
[time=1079] What must that be worth?
[time=1082] Put a price tag on that.
[time=1084] So what's the big deal?
[time=1085] Some might still ask and it would be great if you did.
[time=1088] If you are asking, we want to try and give you some things to think about this morning.
[time=1093] Why is it so significant, some might say.
[time=1096] What about it, this virgin birth, this virgin conception is so foundational and crucial when it comes to our faith.
[time=1104] And I hope you'll ask yourself that right now.
[time=1107] In fact, not only do I hope you'll ask yourself that, but I want you to answer it in your own mind.
[time=1111] Just take a minute.
[time=1112] I'm going to give you some things to think about.
[time=1114] But why don't you just answer that as best you can right now.
[time=1118] It'd be interesting to see what thoughts come to your mind.
[time=1121] It'd be interesting to see what God kind of puts in your heart.
[time=1123] Let me just ask you, and I want you to respond quietly in your heart.
[time=1126] Why is this such a big deal?
[time=1129] Why is the virgin birth such a crucial thing?
[time=1133] Why do we make such a big deal about it?
[time=1136] Why is it so addressed and explained?
[time=1141] What is it about the virgin birth and conception that would be so important for you and me to understand?
[time=1150] I want you to chew on that here just for a moment.
[time=1153] And as you're chewing on that, I want to just tell you what my prayer has been for these next few moments here.
[time=1158] My prayer all week is we come to this topic.
[time=1162] And it was, I think, birthed in me early in the week as I was reading a John Piper Advent devotional.
[time=1171] And I won't say it word for word, but I know that just if it was this, we as a culture, we especially in this culture of faith, those of us who would attest to a biblical faith in Christ, we have been so overwhelmed by.
[time=1185] We have been so overrun by.
[time=1187] We have so bought in to the absolute awesomeness and the
[time=1193] incredibleness and the, oh my gosh, ness of our culture and the movies and entertainment and technology and special.
[time=1203] We go and watch things and we say to our friends, you've got to see that.
[time=1208] It was unbelievable.
[time=1212] And we say that often and we're impacted like that often in this culture of ours.
[time=1217] And my prayer for you and for me this morning is that in a fresh way you would be blown away by the miraculousness,
[time=1229] by the supernaturalness, by the, oh my gosh, ness of this.
[time=1236] It's truth that we come to this morning.
[time=1238] It's bigger.
[time=1240] It's better.
[time=1241] It's more impressive than anything this culture or Hollywood has ever produced.
[time=1247] What's the big deal?
[time=1248] It highlights the supernatural.
[time=1250] It shows humanity's inability to save itself.
[time=1254] It puts God's initiative on display and it brings into clear view the hundred, hundred factor that you and I desperately needed.
[time=1263] Let's look at that first one.
[time=1265] The virgin birth, it highlights the supernatural.
[time=1268] When you turn in your Bibles to Luke, Matthew, Mark, Luke chapter 1, it says, right there in Luke 1, 34 and 35, it says this.
[time=1280] It says Mary, Luke 1, 34, said to the angel, how can this be?
[time=1284] The angel says, you know, here's what's going to happen.
[time=1286] She says, how can this be since I am a virgin?
[time=1291] And the angel answered and said to her, the Holy Spirit will
[time=1297] come upon you.
[time=1299] And the power of the Most High will overshadow you.
[time=1305] And for that reason, the Holy Child shall be called the son of who?
[time=1311] Say it.
[time=1312] God.
[time=1314] She, my friends, the virgin birth highlights the supernatural.
[time=1317] And make no mistake, the supernatural was that which differentiates.
[time=1322] It was the differentiating factor between Jesus and anybody else.
[time=1328] It was what separates Jesus.
[time=1330] I know he was normal in a sense and we'll come back to that.
[time=1334] But here, as we jump in, I just want you to be reminded of the fact that it was a supernatural thing.
[time=1341] This virgin birth and this Jesus.
[time=1343] What you have with Jesus is really an earthly life with supernatural, miraculous, awesome bookends.
[time=1351] Maybe just think of it that way.
[time=1353] You have with Jesus this supernatural birth, Holy Spirit will come over you.
[time=1360] The power of the Most High will overshadow you.
[time=1363] And there will be a baby as a result.
[time=1367] We have a supernatural birth, by the way, starts when you think about Jesus, he starts in a cave in a manger alone with
[time=1379] animals.
[time=1382] And when you think about the other bookend, you think about the end of it all.
[time=1386] Supernatural death, supernatural resurrection, supernatural ascension.
[time=1393] It ends in a cave, otherwise known as a tomb, along with God.
[time=1399] It brings him to life.
[time=1401] He ascends to be with the Father.
[time=1403] The virgin birth highlights this supernatural effect that was with him through his entire life and ministry.
[time=1410] You see my friends, the whole ball game with Jesus were the claims he made, the claims that he made, the things that he said he was going to do, the stuff that he promised would happen, none of which could ever do to their nature, none of which could ever come true in normal fashion because they weren't normal claims.
[time=1432] They were extraordinary claims, supernatural assertions requiring supernatural responses.
[time=1439] And if they the claims and he the Christ were ever going to be validated, it would require what we get it.
[time=1445] And what we see here in the pages of this great book, the supernaturalness of it all.
[time=1451] He wasn't normal.
[time=1453] His life wasn't normal.
[time=1456] What he came to fix wasn't normal.
[time=1460] What he brings to your life today isn't normal.
[time=1463] His birth, my friends, was not normal.
[time=1466] Let's keep going.
[time=1467] The virgin birth shows humanity's inability to save itself.
[time=1473] The virgin birth puts on clear display your inability and
[time=1479] mind mankind's inability to do anything about, really do anything about the one problem that separates us from God and that's our sin.
[time=1489] Matthew 1, verse 20, but when, says in Matthew 1, 20, but when
[time=1496] he had considered this, behold an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream saying, Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife.
[time=1504] For the child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit, she will bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus.
[time=1513] For he will save his people from their sins.
[time=1520] The undeniable fact that the human race left to itself could not produce a perfect redeemer which was needed.
[time=1531] Clearly shows that mankind's sin and guilt was so pervasive, so ominous, so profound that outside help had to be called
[time=1541] in.
[time=1542] The reality of sin and its pervasiveness in the human race exposes and reflects the need for salvation to come from beyond
[time=1553] our human capacity.
[time=1555] We couldn't do it.
[time=1557] There wasn't anything we were ever going to be able to ever do.
[time=1562] We had a swing set in our backyard at our place for years
[time=1568] and years, all five of our kids cut their teeth literally on this swing set.
[time=1573] It was the two or three swings and then it was the little fort next to it with the slide and our kids loved it and it was the center of backyard activity for years and they all got grown up and nobody wanted to swing anymore.
[time=1586] And it just sat there.
[time=1587] And the more it sat there, the more dilapidated it would get and the more dilapidated it would get.
[time=1592] It was this wooden thing.
[time=1593] Then all of a sudden the wasps would come and build nests and then somebody would bump it and somebody would get stung.
[time=1600] And so my wife about two years ago started really nicely saying to me words that most of you who know me know bring terror and fright to me, what are you going to do about the swing set?
[time=1616] She would just say it nicely.
[time=1617] Can you please get rid of the swing set?
[time=1621] And again, if you know me, you know that I would listen to that and I would look her in the eye and I'd say, you know I'm going to get on that.
[time=1627] I am.
[time=1628] I'm going to figure out, I'm going to get that swing set out of here.
[time=1631] So I'd go out to the swing set and I'd look at it.
[time=1635] I'd look at this big swing set and I'd think to myself, okay, it won't fit in my suburban.
[time=1641] How do I get rid of this swing set?
[time=1644] I'd look at the bolts and the screws on this thing are huge and I'm thinking about my toolbox.
[time=1649] We've joked about my toolbox for years.
[time=1651] You all know I have a Tupperware toolbox.
[time=1655] And anything in my toolbox, you and I could snap in half with our hands.
[time=1660] That's how heavy duty my tools are.
[time=1663] So I would just, you know, I'd kind of kick at it and look at it and I'd walk away.
[time=1668] Months would go by, hey Kelly, when are you going to get rid of the swing set?
[time=1672] And I would just go out there and it was just this exercise and futility because my mind and the way I think it just doesn't all come together.
[time=1680] I could put something like this together but I couldn't quite figure out how to get rid of the swing set.
[time=1686] So I gave in.
[time=1687] I realized help had to come from beyond myself and I did the most humiliating thing I called Tom Martin.
[time=1695] Tom Martin is our neighbor.
[time=1697] And I love Tom Martin but I hate Tom Martin with all my heart.
[time=1701] Tom Martin is that neighbor who never, ever, ever, ever sit still.
[time=1706] He's always building something.
[time=1708] Do you guys know Tom Martin?
[time=1709] You know guys like Tom Martin?
[time=1711] They're always digging things.
[time=1712] They're always fixing stuff.
[time=1713] They want to deck.
[time=1714] They build it.
[time=1715] They're planting trees.
[time=1716] They're paving their driveway.
[time=1718] I mean Tom just goes and goes.
[time=1719] There's times I want to just yell out of my house.
[time=1721] Get a sandwich and watch a game.
[time=1723] So I call Tom and my heart tastes this all.
[time=1728] Kelly, I'd love to help.
[time=1729] Tom Martin gets an attractor, comes over with his bucket, raised up.
[time=1733] There's something in the bucket.
[time=1734] I can't quite see what it is.
[time=1735] Me and the kids meet him out.
[time=1736] They're figured I'd bring my kids so they could be embarrassed of their debt.
[time=1740] And he drives up in the tractor and he lowers the bucket and there's a chainsaw.
[time=1745] And so he gets the chainsaw out and he cuts the swing set in 50 pieces in four minutes.
[time=1750] And all my kids load the pieces up in the bucket.
[time=1752] He puts the chainsaw back in the case and he drives away.
[time=1755] Thank you very much.
[time=1756] Burns the thing in his burn pile and it's all gone within like two hours.
[time=1766] Your sin wasn't going anywhere.
[time=1771] There wasn't anything you were ever going to be able to do about
[time=1777] it.
[time=1778] You needed help outside yourself to be called in and do what
[time=1785] desperately needed to be done.
[time=1788] Sometimes there's stuff we just can't do.
[time=1792] Amen?
[time=1796] The virgin birth puts God's initiative on display.
[time=1799] Wow.
[time=1800] You say, did you say initiative?
[time=1801] Yes, I did.
[time=1802] You understand that God came after you.
[time=1806] Don't you?
[time=1807] You understand, right, that he's a God who comes after you.
[time=1811] This puts God's initiative on display, though it's not kind of a Christmas passage.
[time=1817] Look at the great truth of Romans 5.
[time=1819] Romans 5, 8 to 9.
[time=1821] It'll be on the screen.
[time=1823] It says in Romans 5, 8, but God demonstrates his own love.
[time=1826] What?
[time=1827] Say it, Church.
[time=1828] Towards us.
[time=1832] God's love demonstrated towards you.
[time=1836] He's active in this.
[time=1838] And that while we were yet sinners, Christ was born and died for us.
[time=1844] It goes on in verse 9.
[time=1845] And it says much more than having now been justified by his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through him because he came towards you.
[time=1855] He didn't say you come towards me because you couldn't because you were dead.
[time=1863] So he comes towards you with life.
[time=1866] For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his son.
[time=1871] And you were much more than having been reconciled.
[time=1875] We shall be saved.
[time=1882] John 3, 16, for God so loved you that he acted, he gave his only
[time=1888] son.
[time=1889] One of the ways in which you see this, divine initiative.
[time=1894] Look at Luke 1, 31.
[time=1896] We've looked at it a few times in the last few weeks, but I want to just show it to you again in light of this idea of divine pursuit, divine initiative.
[time=1907] It says there in 1.31.
[time=1908] And behold, here's the angel Gabriel speaking with Mary.
[time=1913] And I want you to notice the verbiage behold, it says, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him
[time=1924] Jesus.
[time=1926] You see, you and I, we needed rescued.
[time=1929] We were dead in our sin, guilty in all of our iniquity, condemned,
[time=1935] condemned to death.
[time=1937] And I just want you to note, he doesn't ask Mary for permission
[time=1945] to do this.
[time=1947] The terminology isn't weak.
[time=1950] The mindset, the posture, if you will, isn't passive.
[time=1955] No, he says to her.
[time=1957] He says it gently, but he says it decisively.
[time=1960] You will conceive.
[time=1963] You will bear a son, and you will name him Jesus because my
[time=1970] people are dying in their sin.
[time=1973] And this is my plan.
[time=1978] Church be reminded that God had a plan.
[time=1982] He had a plan to save you.
[time=1990] And he doesn't think about it.
[time=1993] This is how you and I do it.
[time=1995] He doesn't think about it.
[time=2001] He doesn't voice intentions.
[time=2005] He doesn't even try really hard.
[time=2008] He just, what, does it?
[time=2015] He's not passive.
[time=2017] He's active.
[time=2018] He's not reactive.
[time=2020] He's proactive.
[time=2022] He doesn't stand back.
[time=2025] He leans into that which you and I desperately needed him to
[time=2031] lean into.
[time=2032] He shows his initiative toward you.
[time=2036] And lastly, the virgin birth brings into clear view the 100-100 factor.
[time=2044] Fully divine and fully human.
[time=2047] The statement in and of itself doesn't make any sense.
[time=2051] One of my kids said, you mean it's like 200%.
[time=2055] I'm like, no, no, no, but just think about it.
[time=2057] I know it's weird, but he was.
[time=2058] He was 100% God, and he was 100% man.
[time=2064] Just like our kids are 100% us and 100% a spouse.
[time=2070] Luke 1, 31, 32 and 33 says it so well.
[time=2074] If you just listen, if you just read it slowly, you kind of get blown away all over again.
[time=2079] And behold, Mary, you, Mary, human will conceive in your
[time=2085] physical human womb and bear a son from your womb, from you, Mary, 15-year-old Hebrew.
[time=2093] You shall name him Jesus.
[time=2095] Okay, great.
[time=2096] Amazing.
[time=2097] And he will be great and will be called the son of the most
[time=2103] high.
[time=2105] Here's the incarnation right here, folks.
[time=2108] And the Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David.
[time=2112] And he will, this baby born from your womb, he will reign over the house of Jacob forever and his kingdom will have no end.
[time=2121] Wayne Grudem said, God and his wisdom ordained a combination of human and divine influence in the birth of Christ so that his full humanity would be evident to us from the fact of his ordinary human birth from a human mother.
[time=2139] And his full deity would be evident to us from the fact of his conception in Mary's womb by the supernatural work of the Holy
[time=2149] Spirit.
[time=2151] Okay, some might say, okay, but why is that a big deal?
[time=2156] Why is it that a hundred, a hundred is so crucial?
[time=2160] Great question.
[time=2161] Let's just break it down and look at both sides real quick before we go.
[time=2167] First, we'll look at the divine side.
[time=2170] I hope after these 20 minutes, I hope the why is it so important that Jesus be 100% God question is really easy for you to answer right now.
[time=2184] We've already hit that one pretty hard.
[time=2187] Your sin was so bad, your iniquity so deep, you were spiritually and eternally damned by your own doing and you desperately needed
[time=2199] someone, something beyond you, you desperately needed the divine.
[time=2206] And in the virgin birth and the person of Christ, you get that.
[time=2210] On the 100% human front, look at Hebrews 4.15.
[time=2215] I love these verses and Hebrews 4 and Hebrews 5.
[time=2218] I don't know if you've read them lately.
[time=2220] If you ever want to just be encouraged about how this thing worked and what it was really like with the humanness of our Lord.
[time=2226] Look at 4.15, for we do not have a high priest, that's Jesus, who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, anything you've gone through, any temptation you face, any challenge that comes your way, any heartache you're in the midst of, any feelings of loss,
[time=2247] any struggles with addiction, temptation, whatever it might be.
[time=2253] Hebrews 4 reminds you that he has felt and experienced every
[time=2259] single bit of it.
[time=2263] He's not a guy who can't sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without
[time=2272] what? Without sin. Look at Hebrews 5, 7 and 9.
[time=2277] What a great, great picture this paints.
[time=2279] In the days of his Jesus, in the days of his flesh, he offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears.
[time=2290] Sound familiar?
[time=2293] To the one able to save him from death.
[time=2296] And he was heard because of his piety.
[time=2298] It goes on in verse 8 to say, "Although he was a son, in the capital S, he learned obedience from the things which he what, say it, suffered.
[time=2310] And having been made perfect, he became to all those who obey him.
[time=2315] That could be you. That could be me.
[time=2318] The source of eternal salvation.
[time=2322] Why is it so important that Jesus be 100% man?
[time=2328] Here's why this is so significant.
[time=2330] The humanity of Christ means you have a Savior who not only knows and felt and experienced everything you go through, but he unlike you endured it all perfectly without sin.
[time=2345] So he could forgive you in all of your sin.
[time=2349] And number two, because he knows, because he felt, because he experienced every single challenge you'll ever face, he makes a way.
[time=2360] We're so thankful for this this morning.
[time=2363] He makes a path that you can with his help walk through anything,
[time=2373] because he's been there.
[time=2375] And he will walk with you.
[time=2378] His power will go with you.
[time=2380] His strength will go with you as you make your way down this road of life.
[time=2385] And that, my friends, is a tremendous, tremendous truth.
[time=2391] Bow your heads with me.
[time=2393] Would you this morning, our Father, in heaven, we come in these days to this celebration of your son's birth, a miraculous,
[time=2403] supernatural event that you ordained before the foundations of the world
[time=2411] and the fact that you did, you could have done it any way.
[time=2414] He could have come as a man, he could have come at 20, he could have come at 40, but he comes as a baby, modeling for us the dependence of young life.
[time=2424] God, he comes from a woman modeling for us his humanity, and he comes from you, modeling for us the greatness of his deity.
[time=2437] It makes him worthy of our following.
[time=2441] It makes him special.
[time=2443] It makes our faith special.
[time=2447] God, it makes these days that we find ourselves in the midst of this morning so very special.
[time=2455] As Vivi's saying, "Oh, come.
[time=2458] Oh, come, let us adore him.
[time=2461] Let us that know him.
[time=2464] Let us who have fully surrendered our hearts and lives to him.
[time=2469] Come this morning and tomorrow and the next day, and adore one who is worthy of our adornment, worthy of our praise.
[time=2480] For it's in his miraculous, supernatural name that we pray.
[time=2488] [AMEN]
[time=2500] Of the Father's love begotten, hear the world begin to be.
[time=2509] Hear the source of all that has been, and know the future you shall see.
[time=2519] Evermore, evermore,
[time=2527] he shall reign forevermore.
[time=2532] Humble King, sovereign Lord, he shall reign forevermore.
[time=2550] Oh, that birthforever blessing, when the chosen virgin go, by the Holy Ghost conceiving, and bore the Savior of our world.
[time=2571] Evermore, evermore,
[time=2577] he shall reign forevermore.
[time=2582] Humble King, sovereign Lord, he shall reign forevermore.
[time=2595] He is found in human fashion,
[time=2601] left and sorrow here too.
[time=2604] Evermore at the race of Adam's children, tuned to the law to endless war, may not henceforth die in bearish, in the dreadful gulf below, but forever rest in beauty, in the light of heaven's love.
[time=2625] Evermore, evermore, he shall reign forevermore.
[time=2635] Humble King, sovereign Lord, he shall reign forevermore.
[time=2648] He shall reign forevermore.
