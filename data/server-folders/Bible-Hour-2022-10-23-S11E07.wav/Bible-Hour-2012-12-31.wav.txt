[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=33] It's great to have you with us and allow me to say from the entire Blackhawk family and team a happy new year to each and every one of you.
[time=42] We're starting out the new year, like we always do.
[time=45] We spend the first month or so of every new calendar year addressing from the Bible's perspective the issue of family.
[time=53] And I wonder how your family is today.
[time=56] I wonder how your family's doing relationally or spiritually or emotionally.
[time=61] I wonder what the state of your family is in.
[time=64] Oftentimes as we come through December and all the activity of December.
[time=69] Sometimes January finds us in kind of a reflective mode taking an assessment of how we're doing and how those we love are doing.
[time=80] And sometimes if you're anything like me and my family you realize at the beginning of the new year your family needs some help.
[time=88] Your family needs some encouragement.
[time=90] Your family needs some direction.
[time=93] And so I hope you'll come on Sunday mornings all through the month of January and even the first Sunday of February we're gonna take a five week look at God's design for the family, for marriage and for parenting and for dads and for conflict and a myriad of things that we believe will help encourage you with a better understanding of what God designed and some practical steps on how you and I can with our families move in that direction.
[time=121] So I hope you'll come.
[time=122] Sunday mornings at nine and 1045 we're calling it modern families and we believe God's ancient truth.
[time=129] We believe the scripture still applies to the everyday needs of today's family and I can't wait to see what he's gonna do.
[time=136] In your life and your family and your home and in mine.
[time=140] Hey God bless you.
[time=140] Thank you for tuning in and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=144] (upbeat music)
[time=148] [MUSIC]
[time=153] It's so good to see you and be together today.
[time=164] I wanna invite you if you would to stand to your feet now.
[time=168] That song that we were just singing talks about how Christ is worthy of all glory and honor and praise.
[time=176] Would you just take a minute and bow your heads and would you in your own words just thank Jesus this morning for the way that he's manifested himself in your life this week or even maybe yet this day.
[time=191] And let's give him praise in our own words.
[time=194] (upbeat music)
[time=206] (gentle music) As a dear pants for flowing streams
[time=224] so pants my soul for you O Lord.
[time=226] My soul thirsts for God for the living God.
[time=231] When shall I come and appear before him?
[time=236] And Jesus you said to the woman at the well everyone who drinks of this earthly water will be thirsty again.
[time=243] But whoever drinks of the water you give will never be thirsty again.
[time=249] The water that you give us will become in us a spring of water welling up to eternal life.
[time=256] And like that woman this morning God we say sir give us this water so that we will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.
[time=269] [MUSIC - 21 seconds]
[time=295] Sing that again all my hope.
[time=299] [MUSIC - 43 seconds]
[time=346] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 146 seconds]
[time=512] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 217 seconds]
[time=737] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 36 seconds]
[time=793] (gentle piano music) - Well, I wanna welcome you.
[time=802] It's exciting for me to be able to welcome all of you to the start of a new year here at Black Hawk in the beginning of a new series we've entitled "Modern Families." And in such a modern, innovative society filled with all that is new and changing and better and different, I love the question that we're asking as part of our subtitle this morning.
[time=828] Are God's ancient truths, do God's ancient truths still apply today?
[time=834] And I wanna draw your attention to a number on the screen, 260-622-8398, it is our Black Hawk text number if over the course of this morning or if over the course of the next five weeks, you have any questions, comments at all about our teaching, things that might stir in you, we would invite you to text your question or comment to that number, go ahead and punch it in your phone right now if you need to.
[time=860] If you don't text and you wanna write a question or hand something to me or mail it in, you're more than welcome to do so.
[time=866] But please take advantage of the texting opportunity we'll use these questions and comments to help shape our communication in the weeks to come.
[time=875] Would you all, with families in mind, would you stand and let me read you this morning Ephesians chapter five.
[time=881] Ephesians chapter five, we're gonna start in verse 15 where it says, therefore, be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise.
[time=895] Making the most of your time, remember this, families, making the most of your time because the days are evil, so then do not be foolish, but understand what the will
[time=908] of the Lord is with families in view this morning.
[time=912] This is our opening passage and this is our prayer.
[time=916] Would you bow your heads with me, Father in Heaven?
[time=919] May we be a people this morning as we think of our own families.
[time=923] May we be a people that with your help would make the most of our time.
[time=929] Would you please, God, through your help, through your spirit, through your word, through your son, would you help us not to be foolish?
[time=937] Would you give us a deep and growing understanding of that which is the will of the Lord?
[time=942] Your will, Lord, for us.
[time=945] May we see it, may we know it, and most importantly, God, would you give us the grace to follow it in your son's name, we pray.
[time=954] Amen, you can be seated.
[time=955] Well, every January, over the last couple of years, at least here at Blackhawk, we begin the new year with a fresh look into the scriptures in God's design for something that each and every one of us are a part of, it's called the family.
[time=971] Families, families, some of yours today here in the room, some of yours are struggling.
[time=979] Some of yours are thriving.
[time=982] Some families here in the room this morning are broken, some are on the mend, some are tired and aging, some families just starting out.
[time=990] Either way, it brings up one of the great realities of the journey we experience as families as we follow Jesus Christ and the principles of God's word.
[time=1000] What's that great reality?
[time=1001] You might ask that great reality, my friends, is this.
[time=1005] In God's economy, don't forget this, it's never over.
[time=1008] It's never over.
[time=1012] There's always opportunity, doesn't matter who you are, doesn't matter where you've been, doesn't matter what has transpired, there's always opportunity to grow.
[time=1021] It can always get better.
[time=1023] It can always be more God honoring than it is today.
[time=1026] Whether you're 20, whether you're 40, whether you're 60, it's never over.
[time=1031] And so like I said, I am excited to welcome you this morning, but I also want to challenge you this morning right out of the gate.
[time=1039] I'm challenging you over the course of these five weeks to be honest.
[time=1044] Would you please, each and every one of you
[time=1050] that would take the time to be here and listen to what God's word has to say, would you commit this morning to be honest?
[time=1058] To be truthful, to be authentic.
[time=1064] Not so much with me, but with yourself and before God.
[time=1069] My prayer for you this week, as I've thought about our times together, is that you would be courageous enough to face whatever might really be there.
[time=1080] When you look at you and when you look at your family and when you look at your reality, would you be courageous enough to face all that's there?
[time=1089] When I ask you the questions that I believe God has put on my heart to ask you, and I will, I'll ask you questions as these weeks proceed, would you be honest?
[time=1098] When the word of God, as it always does, brings its light.
[time=1103] I love the light of the word of God.
[time=1105] I love what Psalm 119 says, it's really true.
[time=1108] The word of God is a lamp unto our feet.
[time=1111] It is a light unto our path.
[time=1115] When the light of Scripture starts to, and these weeks to come, when it starts to illuminate, when it starts to bring into the light the dark parts of your heart.
[time=1125] The dark parts of your habits, your marriage, your parenting, your home, would you be honest?
[time=1136] Would you be truthful?
[time=1137] At about week three, and I mean this, when the enemy tries to pull you aside at about week three and trust me, he will, because the family, marriage, and the home, these are Satan's highest priorities, which makes this whole topic, it makes this whole series really a spiritual battlefield because he has declared war on you, and your marriage, and your home, and your kids, and your future.
[time=1165] And so he will at some time in this series, whisper or yell into your ear, what are you doing listening to this guy?
[time=1173] Who does he think he is getting into all your personal stuff?
[time=1180] He doesn't know you, he doesn't know your circumstance, he doesn't know what you're going through, because remember, Satan always wants you to believe that your circumstance trumps the truth.
[time=1193] In Satan's economy, relief from pain is always more important than principle.
[time=1200] And so he'll push you, he'll tempt you to not even come back for next week, or to stop listening.
[time=1207] And I'm asking you this morning to commit to being honest.
[time=1211] I'm asking you to resist Satan, to actually say no, Satan, I need to hear the truth instead of your lies.
[time=1221] I'm inviting you to resist the enemy in salvage, or strengthen your home and family.
[time=1227] We sometimes forget too many times what it says in James 4-7.
[time=1231] You'll see it on the screen.
[time=1232] What a great encouragement for us as we begin this journey together today.
[time=1236] It says in James 4-7, submit therefore to God.
[time=1240] I'm inviting you this morning to consider submitting your heart and your home and your family and your relationships to God in a fresh way.
[time=1247] And as the verse begins, submit therefore to God.
[time=1251] Look what it says.
[time=1253] Resist to, say it.
[time=1255] Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[time=1259] Did you know that?
[time=1261] Some of you did, others of you didn't.
[time=1263] But when you with great resolve, when you with great confidence, when you with great hope in your heart, resist the devil.
[time=1271] When he says do this, when he says think this, when he says act out in this way, and you're willing to say based upon the truth of who God is and what his word says, when you and I are willing to stand up and say, no, I don't think so.
[time=1287] I'm not gonna go that direction.
[time=1288] I'm gonna stand here and I'm gonna do what's right.
[time=1290] It says he flees from you.
[time=1293] In my prayer, all week has been, that you would be willing to be getting this morning to resist him in a way that he would flee from you and give you and your heart and your home and your family.
[time=1305] A fresh opportunity to grow in ways that would be fruitful.
[time=1309] So, all right, in general.
[time=1313] In general, how's the family doing these days in this world of ours?
[time=1321] How's the family in this culture that you and I live in?
[time=1325] No one needs to try and convince me that culturally, we may actually be watching the death of the family.
[time=1334] The death of the family, family as designed and orchestrated by God.
[time=1339] We really don't need a slew of statistics on the screen today because we see it and we hear it and we experience it every day.
[time=1347] The deep and destructive widespread impact of divorce, sexual rebellion, sexual perversion, abortion, parental abandonment, infidelity, homosexuality, pornography, catastrophic personal debt, violence, promiscuity.
[time=1366] Talk about the modern family.
[time=1370] There it is, right there in all its glory and the terminal effect that all of that left unchecked can have in the life of a family and a home.
[time=1383] In a book entitled "The Death of a Family," a British physician named Graham Cooper suggests doing away with and I quote, doing away with the family completely because it is a primary conditioning device only for a Western imperialistic worldview.
[time=1399] Kate Millet, who is a very prominent feminist, wrote a book called "Sexual Politics" and in it she writes that the family must go because it oppresses and enslaves and demeans women.
[time=1412] The people who hold these perspectives are aggressive, forceful, domineering and and they find their most fertile ground for the promotion of their viewpoints and the universities and colleges of our day and consequently they are in the process of significantly re-educating and re-doctinating the youth who eventually fall into the category of leaders in our society, today's young men and women.
[time=1440] Mrs. T. Grace Atkinson of the National Organization of Women
[time=1446] seeks to eliminate and I quote all sex.
[time=1449] She seeks to eliminate all sex, all marriage, all motherhood and all love, she says.
[time=1455] She says marriage is legalized servitude and family relations are the basis for all human oppression and you may say that's warped and you may say that's sad and I would certainly agree but in many cases understand it is the reigning perspective among the thinkers and scholars and teachers in our society today.
[time=1481] On the other hand, there are those watching the death of the family that see it as a disaster.
[time=1487] Dr. Armon Nikolai the second of Harvard Medical School and again no Bible people got Armon here to say this.
[time=1495] This is Harvard Medical on his own research, on his own data and his own conclusions.
[time=1501] He sees the trend to destroy the family as a devastating trend.
[time=1506] He points to married women with children working unnecessarily outside the home, the tendency for families to move frequently, almost constantly, the dominance of television and technology in the home, the lack of ethical controls in society, the chaos of moral confusion and disintegration, the widespread proliferation of violence, the lack of communication among families and all of those things he says are threatening the very life which we live.
[time=1541] Let me quote from him he says, "These trends will incapacitate the family, destroy its integrity and cause its members to suffer such crippling emotional conflict that they will become an intolerable burden to society." What about the future when asked?
[time=1559] Nikolai said first the quality of family life will continue to deteriorate producing a society where they hire incidents of mental illness than ever before.
[time=1571] This illness that will attack the family will be characterized by a lack of self-control, a lack of self-control.
[time=1581] We can expect the assassination of people in authority to be frequent, crimes of violence he says will increase, even those within the family, the suicide rate will rise as sexuality becomes more and more unlimited and separated from family and emotional commitment, the deadening effect will cause more bizarre experimentation and widespread emotional perversion.
[time=1608] A frankly frightening picture he says
[time=1614] and we're watching it being played out right before our very eyes.
[time=1618] Nikolai wrote that in 1984 and it happened and it keeps happening
[time=1631] and it just keeps going.
[time=1634] Dr. John MacArthur said there is no question that the family is under a major assault that people want to redefine family in absolutely any terms they want.
[time=1647] There's no question that we are watching a generation of young people rising up who have no socialization skills and no moral compass at all.
[time=1656] There is chaos, there is murder, there is crime at a rampant level, there is even pleasure in shooting people incidental to you just for the sheer thrill of killing.
[time=1668] Sociologists, psychologists, analysts and experts are scrambling all over the place to try to come up with some kind of solution and they've been trying for decades with absolutely no impact on the slide.
[time=1681] Nothing they are doing seems to slow down the process of the disintegration of human relationships at the very core of life which is the family.
[time=1691] You can tamper with society in a lot of places but if you destroy the family, you destroy society.
[time=1698] And now today as the decline continues, people are asking more and more, more often than ever can the family be saved.
[time=1708] Can the family be saved?
[time=1712] To which we would say this morning, to which I stand here with great hope in my heart and a conviction in my soul to say to you, absolutely yes.
[time=1722] Absolutely the family can be saved.
[time=1724] Absolutely the family can be all that God ever designed it to be, yes the family can stand strong and tall again.
[time=1733] When and only when God's wise and loving design for the family is followed.
[time=1741] And I say wise and loving because the truth is it's not demeaning, it's not oppressive nor is it malicious or manipulative.
[time=1750] You are, I am all those things.
[time=1756] But don't ever confuse our fallenness with his design.
[time=1763] His design is perfect.
[time=1765] His design is right.
[time=1767] His design is good.
[time=1768] We get oppressive, we get manipulative.
[time=1771] We mess it up in huge and sad ways.
[time=1773] But God's design for family is wise and loving and it is what we desperately need.
[time=1779] So where do we find God's design for the family?
[time=1782] Look back in your Bibles to Ephesians 5 my friends.
[time=1785] Around 60 A.D. the Apostle Paul wrote this letter and sent it off to the saints, to the church who are at Ephesus.
[time=1793] Paul wrote this and one of the things that was on his heart was the matter of marriage and family.
[time=1798] And when you come down to chapter five verse 18, chapter five verse 18, you begin to get into the flow.
[time=1806] Watch this, it's amazing.
[time=1808] You begin to get into the flow of the context that leads you to verse 22 and following where all the issues of family and marriage are addressed biblically.
[time=1820] We're gonna talk a lot about these things in this series over the next five weeks but we'll constantly come back to Ephesians 5 as a home base.
[time=1829] And please keep in mind that this is not human opinion that you're gonna hear.
[time=1835] I'm not here to give you my thoughts or my opinion.
[time=1838] I don't really value my opinion at all and neither should you.
[time=1843] All I wanna do is show you what the word of God says and the applicable wisdom that comes from it.
[time=1852] This is my friends on marriage and family and kids in the home, this is the last word.
[time=1859] This is what I live by, this is what we believe in, this is what we shoot for, this is what guides us.
[time=1865] We're not looking for tricks, we're not looking for gimmicks, we're looking for truth that can become part of our lives.
[time=1873] And that's what we hope happens here in these weeks.
[time=1876] Now as Paul begins to launch into this subject, he starts at least for us here in verse 18 and with a very, very important point, he says do not get drunk, you can see it there.
[time=1891] Ephesians 5, 18, do not get drunk with wine for that is dissipation but be filled with the spirit.
[time=1900] You see that?
[time=1902] It really is, I want you to know this as we start.
[time=1904] This really is the key that unlocks all the rest for our discussion about family and marriage and parenting in our homes.
[time=1914] From this one principle, don't be drunk with wine for that is dissipation but be filled with the spirit.
[time=1922] From this one principle flows the instruction to the wife in verse 22, the instruction to the husband in verse 25, the instruction to the children in chapter six verse one, the instruction to the parents in chapter six verse two, all of the marriage and family teaching that comes in the next chapter and a half flows out of this principle in chapter five verse 18.
[time=1947] And the contrast there as you read it is really quite dramatic, don't get drunk with wine but be filled with the spirit.
[time=1959] If you just picked up the book of Ephesians and read that you might stop and say, where did that come from?
[time=1966] Why is he all of a sudden talking about, I mean with family stuff coming, why does he make this point about not being drunk with wine?
[time=1976] And the answer, and this is so, it's just so cool and so helpful and so significant when you see the word of God work like this, the answer is in the context, the historical context that these people were living in, the answer to that question really resides in what was happening in that society and how God in his perfect divinity kind of reaches in to that scene with this truth and he does so in a way that would make sense to anybody who read it because they were a Greek culture.
[time=2013] Ephesus was an Asia minor and anybody in a Greek culture in that day would have been absolutely all bought into the whole Zeus, Greek, God, pantheon of God's thing and they all knew, they were very aware of the fact that it is in Greek mythology, a tradition that Zeus had a son named Dionysius and Dionysius it says as you study Greek mythology, Dionysius spawned a new religion that was now absolutely sweeping the land.
[time=2047] A new religion of ecstasy, a new religion of sensuality and emotionalism and the Dionysian cult, this religion of ecstasy and emotionalism, this frenzied kind of religion absolutely saturated the Ephesian world, the Roman world, the Dionysian cult was a debauched immoral form of pagan worship, the worshipers committed atrocities with human organs, they engaged in orgies of sexual perversion along with music and dancing and feasting but there was one common element to all of the Dionysian debacle and that was, anybody wanna guess?
[time=2089] Drunkenness, drunkenness.
[time=2093] That's how they got their inhibitions out.
[time=2095] That's how they dealt with their fear or their sorrow.
[time=2098] That's how they dealt with this normal feeling of guilt.
[time=2101] That's how they dulled their senses sufficiently to quiet their conscience.
[time=2105] That's how they dispelled their anxiety and guilt over the vile behavior they engaged in.
[time=2111] That's how they induced a kind of giddiness that substituted for real joy and it just threw them into this horrible behavior and they did it all by getting what?
[time=2122] Say it, drunk.
[time=2124] See, knowing the context is what's so great
[time=2130] about studying the scriptures.
[time=2132] This is the world these people lived in.
[time=2135] Now you come to verse 18 and it takes on completely different meaning.
[time=2140] In the light of that context, he's saying to them, don't get drunk with wine.
[time=2143] All that does is produce sin.
[time=2146] If you wanna commune with God, if you wanna be filled with the spirit, our relationship with God isn't brought about in its fullness or its richness by drunkenness but rather by the filling of the spirit of God.
[time=2161] Don't be filled with alcohol.
[time=2163] Be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[time=2166] Now listen, church, listen, families.
[time=2170] If you want true worship to take place,
[time=2176] if you want godly family living,
[time=2182] then you must be filled with the spirit
[time=2188] is what he's saying, not controlled by the flesh.
[time=2191] There's a parallel passage.
[time=2195] If you turn over Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, if you go over to Colossians three, he says the very same thing to the church at Colossae, Colossians 3 16, where instead of saying, be filled with the spirit, Paul says, what does he say there in 3 16?
[time=2213] Let the word of Christ, let the word of Christ richly dwell within you with all wisdom teaching and admonishing.
[time=2222] It's a great phrase.
[time=2223] Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you.
[time=2227] It says, because it's really, Paul says, let the word of Christ richly dwell within you and Colossians three, 16, where in Ephesians five, he says, be filled with the Holy Spirit because it's really the same thing.
[time=2241] Think about this.
[time=2243] When the word of Christ dominates your life and you respond in obedience to it, it's the same thing as being controlled by the Holy Spirit, of course, because who's the author of Scripture?
[time=2257] Who's the author of Scripture?
[time=2262] First Peter, just to remind you, just we'll look at it real quick, 'cause I wanna make sure you make the connection.
[time=2268] Second Peter 1, 20, but know this, first of all, that no prophecy, the Bible, no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation.
[time=2277] Why?
[time=2278] For no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men move by the what?
[time=2285] Say it, church, Holy Spirit who spoke from God.
[time=2290] Being filled or controlled by the Holy Spirit, it's the same thing as obedience to the word.
[time=2300] Filled with the Spirit, obedience to the word.
[time=2303] Obedience, exposure to an obedience to the word, same as being filled with the Spirit.
[time=2308] And please understand, it's not some kind of mystical experience.
[time=2313] It's not something that comes over you and catapults you into some unconscious behavior.
[time=2319] It simply is to be continuously controlled by the Spirit of God who does this controlling in you
[time=2328] as you submit yourself to the word of God on a regular basis.
[time=2334] So this is where we have to start, my friends, as we come to a series on the family.
[time=2339] Whatever we're going to do in terms of our Christian life, whether it's our marriage, our family, our parenting, it has to flow out of a life controlled by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2349] And that's why our society, that's why this world of ours has absolutely no chance, no hope, they don't know God.
[time=2358] And when you don't know Him and you don't possess the Spirit, you are powerless to stand with strength in the midst of all that the enemy is propagating and proliferating in this culture of ours.
[time=2374] A right, listen, a right kind of marriage relationship and a right kind of family relationship is built on a redeemed life.
[time=2384] Empowered and energized by the Holy Spirit in obedience to the word of God is their hope for you and your family.
[time=2391] I hope you'll write this down on your note sheet, be filled with the Spirit.
[time=2397] Be filled with the Spirit.
[time=2399] What do I mean by that?
[time=2400] Well, I hope you'll just scribble this on the side.
[time=2403] Intentional and large doses of God's word.
[time=2407] Intentional and large, let's not go small.
[time=2412] Let's go large.
[time=2413] Intentional and large doses of God's word.
[time=2417] Frequent times of prayer, submitting yourself to the Spirit's control.
[time=2422] Somebody asked me, how do you do this?
[time=2424] And I just tried to really basically help them understand the way that you do this as you ask Him.
[time=2430] When you get up, when you lie down, when you're at work, when you're in the car, when you're going into a meeting, when you're heading into a tough discussion, whatever the circumstance is in your life, at whatever point of the day the people of God can come before their God and say, would you please fill me with your Spirit?
[time=2450] I want to be filled with your Spirit in this setting.
[time=2454] Trust me that when I say this to you, we're always gonna be filled with something.
[time=2459] You're gonna be filled with anger.
[time=2461] You're gonna be filled with resentment.
[time=2463] You're gonna be filled with guilt.
[time=2464] You're gonna be filled with something and hear the word of God reminds us to be filled with the Spirit.
[time=2470] And when the filling of the Spirit comes in in partnership with this obedience to and exposure to the word of God, what we have is a Father.
[time=2481] What we have is a Mother.
[time=2483] What we have are kids.
[time=2484] Kids can contrary to popular opinion.
[time=2487] Kids can be filled with the Spirit.
[time=2489] This is really true.
[time=2490] 15-year-olds can be Spirit-filled.
[time=2494] We can be filled with the Spirit of God when we submit ourselves to intentional and large doses of His word and frequent times of prayer submitting ourselves to His control.
[time=2506] And if you will pursue a Spirit-filled life, look.
[time=2510] Look what the result will be in you and what that could mean for your marriage, your home and your family.
[time=2517] Look at verse 19, go back to Ephesians in 5-19, it says, speaking to one another, be filled that says in 18 with the Spirit.
[time=2525] And here's what happens.
[time=2526] Speaking to each other in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord.
[time=2535] Trust me, I've seen this, I've experienced this, where the Holy Spirit of God controls a life.
[time=2543] A life devoted to the word of God, there is praise.
[time=2548] There really is.
[time=2550] Praise is one of the things that comes out of.
[time=2553] Praise is one of the things that's present in someone whose heart and soul and life are filled by the Spirit of God.
[time=2562] If you'll be consumed by the Spirit of God and the word of God, there's a singing spirit, an expressive spirit, a worshiping spirit that evolves.
[time=2574] A Holy Spirit-filled person is characterized by number one praise.
[time=2579] They begin to more and more and more so in their lives overflow.
[time=2583] There's an overflowing that you sense inside you.
[time=2586] When the Spirit of God and the word of God are filling you up, when you come to faith in Christ, you're filled with the Holy Spirit.
[time=2594] As you grow in that relationship, you start to, I've seen it before and I've heard it, people say they come in and when we're singing, you actually start to read the words.
[time=2602] You start to internalize the words.
[time=2604] You start to celebrate the words.
[time=2606] The words on the screen become much more than they've ever been to you in the past.
[time=2611] As your heart and mind and soul are filled up with the Spirit of God, praise is one of the results.
[time=2619] Look at the second one, verse 20.
[time=2620] Ephesians 5, 20, always giving thanks, moms and dads,
[time=2626] husbands and wives, kids, I hope you'll see that.
[time=2631] Always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father.
[time=2641] Let me say it this way, on the family front, it's very, very difficult to not get along with someone whose entire life, whose entire personality, whose entire perspective is characterized by gratitude.
[time=2657] When your whole life, when your whole perspective, when your whole manner is characterized by the gratitude that you just got called to in Ephesians 5, 20, because of all that he's done, read Ephesians 1, 2 and 3 sometime, because of all that he has done for you, because of all that has been made manifest in you because of the work of his son, because of all of his blessings, you have the capacity, it says, to be always grateful for all things, and when you are, it's really tough to not get along with you.
[time=2694] Are you a difficult person to get along with?
[time=2697] In your family, son, daughter, husband, wife, however it applies, are you that person, the demanding one, the grouchy one, the mean one, try being grateful?
[time=2710] I see a lot of punches being thrown right now.
[time=2713] Try being grateful, God's word says you can be grateful.
[time=2719] God's word says you should be a grateful person.
[time=2722] Try being overwhelmed by a gratitude that should run through your spirit and through your bones.
[time=2729] Try being grateful, when you're filled with the Holy Spirit, you can communicate thankfulness instead of disappointment or anger.
[time=2736] God's designed for the family and my friends, the only hope for the family is to be filled with the spirit.
[time=2743] It produces praising, singing people.
[time=2746] It produces supremely thankful people.
[time=2750] And lastly, look at 5.21, with the whole family and marriage teaching, passages about to be unloaded, what's the third and final characteristic of being spirit filled, it says in 21.
[time=2764] And be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
[time=2769] Holy Spirit filled people will be characterized by submission.
[time=2777] They're appraising people, they're a thankful people, and they are a submissive people.
[time=2783] This isn't talking about, listen, this isn't talking about wives to their husbands, this isn't talking about children to their parents, it's talking about everybody with everybody, all family members, everybody in the game, having an attitude and a mindset of submission, general, generic, but powerful submission toward each other.
[time=2810] I read this this week, it's not a matter of cleverness, it's not a matter of romantic or creative ideas, it's not a matter of scheduling events, it's not a matter of buying her gifts or you buying him gifts or cooking his favorite meal.
[time=2823] Those are nice little things to do, but with two people who live according to the standards that we've just read, it wouldn't matter whether you did those things or didn't do them, that's not the stuff that makes for lifelong joy in a relationship or home, submission to each other does.
[time=2844] That's what makes it happen.
[time=2849] When there is a humility in you, dad, when there is a humility in you teenage son, when there is a humility in you grandma or grandpa, who Potasso is the word and the Greek and it means to come under, not on top of, it means to settle in under, to purposefully place one's self in a position of service.
[time=2874] Here you go.
[time=2877] Someone controlled by the spirit of God, obedient to the word of God, filled with joy and praise and thanksgiving to God for every single thing in their life and eager to submit their will to everybody else, that's what we're after and that's what makes a healthy home.
[time=2901] I'll ask Corbin to make his way and I'll ask you just to listen as he comes to close this this morning, there's a true story of a church, true story back about 180 to 100 years ago
[time=2920] over in Romania and there was this church that dominated this community.
[time=2926] Everybody in town went to this one church and regardless of the church's theological perspective, let me tell you this, they didn't want to see families broken up, they wanted to see families staying together and so the stories told that whenever a couple would get in trouble, there was this house that was next to the church, it was a little shed, little tiny little one room house and the leadership of the church would make the couple move into the house and they would give them one fork and one plate, one glass, one blanket, one bed, they'd bring meals each night and they'd leave them there for a month and they said work it out because it's about submission, it's about letting go,
[time=2976] it's about coming under, it's about you first, it's about not me and I hope whatever your situation is this morning as we look to these next few weeks, I hope that your heart is open to what God wants to do in you and I can't wait to see how it turns out, we'll just stand and have Corbin lead us here as we get ready to close.
[time=2995] (gentle music)
[time=3006] [MUSIC - 253 seconds]
[time=3264] - Hey, with the lights down low,
[time=3280] would you just bow your heads in as Corbin plays?
[time=3282] Just consider this please as we go.
[time=3286] When someone fully surrenders their heart and life to Christ, the Word of God teaches us that the Spirit of God comes to reside literally in your being.
[time=3298] We call that the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3302] And that's a once and for all deal, never ever to be altered.
[time=3305] Someone who genuinely knows and has surrendered themselves to Christ, the Spirit of God resides.
[time=3311] There is also the reality that God's Word tells us that you and I have choices to make as the days go by.
[time=3319] And you can make choices to be filled with or governed by the flesh.
[time=3324] And the results of that are not good.
[time=3329] Or we can make choices each and every day to be filled with the what, say it, the Spirit.
[time=3335] And so I wanna just again make this as practical as I can.
[time=3339] Would you just say, would you just say these words out loud?
[time=3342] Would you just say, a Spirit of God, fill me right now.
[time=3347] Say that, God, fill me right now.
[time=3350] See, because this afternoon you'll wanna be filled with anger.
[time=3355] This afternoon you'll wanna be filled with disappointment.
[time=3360] This afternoon or this evening or tomorrow you'll wanna be filled with frustration.
[time=3364] See, this week, 97 times you'll wanna be filled with
[time=3372] all kinds of things other than the Spirit.
[time=3375] And so here's what I'm saying.
[time=3376] Are you willing 97 times this week?
[time=3380] In your car, at work, in the classroom, on the playground, are you willing to say 97 times Spirit of God, fill me right now?
[time=3391] I wanna be filled more with you because when you're filled with the Spirit of God there's gonna be praise and there's gonna be gratitude and there's gonna be submission and there's gonna be peace and there's gonna be joy.
[time=3403] There's gonna be goodness, amen?
[time=3405] And so Father and Heaven, I stand here as a friend to these people and as one who you have called to shepherd and care for them and I pray, God, that they would respond.
[time=3416] And as moms and dads and husbands and wives and sons and daughters and grandmas and grandpas that they would as a family in their own context and their own setting, that all week long they would beg for your filling, the filling of your spirit, that they would resist the devil, that they would move in a different direction.
[time=3436] Church, we started today, I asked you
[time=3442] within the first five minutes, I said I'm gonna challenge you, I said I want you to be what?
[time=3447] What was the word I said?
[time=3448] Humble.
[time=3449] I said I want you to be humble and honest.
[time=3452] And the very last point I made, Ephesians 5, 21 said submission.
[time=3459] See, I knew where we were ending today.
[time=3461] And none of this will ever work ever unless you're submissive.
[time=3466] Unless you're submissive and humble to him.
[time=3470] Submissive and humble to each other.
[time=3473] Submissive and humble to those who lead.
[time=3474] Submissive and humble is the road to blessing.
[time=3479] And so I pray that for you this morning.
[time=3483] In the name of your son, our glorious Savior, our Lord and Jesus Christ and all the people in the room agreed and said amen.
[time=3513] (upbeat music)
[time=3543] You
