[time=197] Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=200] It is great to have you with us and I mean that.
[time=203] We have been having a great time so far this year in our new January annual series on The Family.
[time=209] Every beginning of the year we start with a look at God's design for the family and you don't need me to sit here and tell you that the family today is being challenged with culture and spirit.
[time=222] The family today is being challenged with culture and society and all that they're throwing at the family.
[time=230] There are choices to be made.
[time=232] There are convictions to be lived out.
[time=235] There are decisions that we have to wrestle with.
[time=238] There is some navigating that we have to do as families who are trying to honor God in the way that we live.
[time=244] It's a real uphill climb and I'm so grateful for the ancient truth of the Word of God that is still so very applicable in modern society.
[time=256] Ancient truths still today giving us guidance and hope for all that we face as families and I'm so thankful that we get to come to God's Word and that we get to do that together in a way that gives us great strength and courage.
[time=270] Hey, as you watch this broadcast more than likely it's January 20th and we'll be talking about parenting I want you to know that next Sunday and I hope you'll write this down I'm going to put this at the bottom of the screen here and I hope you'll be mindful of this January 27th.
[time=287] We're going to dedicate an entire message that morning to what we're calling genealogy.
[time=294] That's right, you've heard of theology.
[time=297] Theology gives us great insight into who God is.
[time=304] Theology gives us great insight into who God is, how He works and how we can interact with Him.
[time=312] Genealogy is going to give you great insight into your teenager.
[time=316] That's right, you're 13, 14, 15, 16 year old.
[time=320] Jesse Hanna is going to be speaking that morning and it's going to be a great message giving you insight into how you can live out your faith as a parent.
[time=330] It's going to give you great insight into how you can in the everyday of your life and home interact with, have a relationship with a teenager in a way whereby truth can get passed along.
[time=343] In a way whereby the ancient truths of scripture can still impact, yes, even the heart and life of a 14, 15, 16 year old.
[time=352] It is one of the great challenges of our culture.
[time=355] Young people who are being absolutely bombarded with things far beyond what you and I ever faced and how can we love them, how can we lead them, how can we guide them, most importantly, how can we set them up to be able to live out of faith that's not yours or mine but their own.
[time=373] Then I hope you'll come, I hope you'll come and be with us that morning, nine and 1045, a Sunday dedicated to the family.
[time=380] Genealogy, going to be a great, great lesson for all of us.
[time=383] I hope you'll be there.
[time=384] Hey, God bless you.
[time=385] Have a great week.
[time=386] We're thankful that you tuned in and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=390] How hard you are, no matter where I am, healing is in your hands.
[time=414] How deep, how strong, now by your grace I stand.
[time=430] Healing is in my hands.
[time=441] The present, our future, our past is in your hands.
[time=451] We're covered by your love.
[time=461] How wide, how wide, no matter where I am, healing is in your hands.
[time=483] How deep, how strong, now by your grace I stand.
[time=499] Healing is in your hands.
[time=509] In all things, we know that we are more than conquerors.
[time=520] You keep us high, our love.
[time=527] In all things, we know that we are more than conquerors.
[time=537] You keep us high, our love.
[time=553] How wide, how wide, no matter where I am, healing is in your hands.
[time=569] How deep, how strong, now by your grace I stand.
[time=585] How wide, how wide, no matter where I am, healing is in your hands.
[time=693] Hey, I gave you a number on the screen last week as we jumped into our series that we've entitled Modern Families.
[time=701] Told you for five weeks, we're going to be coming back to God's design for the family.
[time=705] I gave you a number where you could text in questions, comments, anything that's on your heart and mind.
[time=711] I want to show you that number.
[time=712] Again, there it is.
[time=713] Write it down.
[time=714] Punch it into your phone right now.
[time=715] As you have questions over the weeks, we're going to do our best to answer them.
[time=720] I wanted to just give attention to one that came in last week.
[time=722] I thought it was a great question, honestly.
[time=725] The question went something like this.
[time=727] I'm single with no kids.
[time=731] Why would I sit through five weeks on a series regarding family?
[time=737] I thought that was a great question.
[time=739] I wanted to just respond to that as humbly and as, hopefully, as truthfully as I can.
[time=747] A few things come to my mind.
[time=749] Number one, I want to say this.
[time=750] This is a family.
[time=751] When my family gets together at the dinner table, there's a lot of different things going on there at that table.
[time=757] We say it and we mean it.
[time=759] This is a family.
[time=760] All of you, young, middle-aged and old, married and not, white, blue-collar, educated, uneducated, we don't care.
[time=768] This is us.
[time=769] If you weren't here for five weeks, we dearly miss you.
[time=773] Do you understand that?
[time=775] We mean that.
[time=776] That's not just talk.
[time=777] And so there are times when we teach through topics, there are times when we're teaching through the scriptures, a book of the Bible, where we come to things that are more applicable or more directed to some than others that's just kind of part of life as a family.
[time=792] So I would hope all of you would just kind of hang in there with us.
[time=795] We truly desperately need each other.
[time=797] The other thing I would say to this individual, I don't know if it was a guy or a gal, but I would say with respect to your singleness, you might not always be.
[time=805] You might not always be single, so why not open your heart and mind every one in the room today who's single?
[time=813] Why not open your heart and mind to what God may have for you as He grows your heart and mind and its understanding of His design for family?
[time=821] The third thing I'll mention for those of you who are single as we teach on families is I bet you know some.
[time=828] I bet you know some families.
[time=831] I hope you do, and I hope that what you hear over these five weeks on the family front, while it may not have today direct application to you, I hope you'd use it to encourage and pray for and come alongside those who you know who have families.
[time=846] Because that's what family does.
[time=848] We stand next to and with everybody, no matter what they're going through, whether we're going through it ourselves or not.
[time=856] So great question, there's your number, keep texting in your thoughts and questions, we'll do our best to address it.
[time=863] Question for you this morning, what's marriage for?
[time=866] I want you to answer that in your mind.
[time=868] What is marriage for?
[time=872] The purpose.
[time=874] What is marriage for?
[time=877] Let me ask it another way.
[time=879] What does marriage think about this?
[time=881] What does marriage provide?
[time=884] When you think about marriage, when you think about your understanding of marriage, when you think about the way that we promote marriage, the way marriage is viewed, I wonder this morning in the depths of your heart how you would answer those questions.
[time=896] What marriage for?
[time=901] And what does marriage provide?
[time=907] Today, Blackhawk, we come to week two in our annual family series and a message this morning on marriage.
[time=915] And here's how this oftentimes goes.
[time=917] You have a room full of wives, young wives and old wives, and oh, look at that, isn't that cute?
[time=925] Middle-aged wives and future wives.
[time=929] And as the pastor opens his Bible and the servant on marriage begins, all these wives, they have this one singular deep and burning desire that lazy, frustrating, unthoughtful or unfocused husbands would wake up and finally listen.
[time=954] Is there a woman in the room who wants to say amen?
[time=956] Why does a wife hope for this?
[time=959] Why does a wife think this?
[time=962] Because if he would listen and respond, truth be told, it would be so much better for her.
[time=970] For the kids, for the home, for the family, yes, but in her heart of hearts, she believes it would be so much better for her.
[time=979] And you have a room full of husbands as well, you have young husbands and middle-aged husbands and future husbands and old husbands.
[time=987] And as I make my way to the pulpit, many of them are thinking to themselves, "Dear God in heaven, she won't listen to me divinely force her to listen to Kelly this morning, please."
[time=1000] There are husbands in the room right now hoping that God will cure her of her critical spirit or her lack of discipline or her tendency to manipulate through emotionalism.
[time=1010] Why? Because it will make life for him much better.
[time=1015] The kids, the home, yeah, that too, but really mostly it would make it a lot easier and a lot more enjoyable for him.
[time=1024] Let me just say this, I understand that.
[time=1028] Anyone honest and married knows it's true.
[time=1032] We see a teaching on marriage coming and we hope she listens.
[time=1036] We hope he'll take notes.
[time=1038] We hope it will get better because that would be really helpful for us.
[time=1043] And as much as I understand that thinking, I get to stand here this morning and say two things to you.
[time=1051] Upon further review, not of the instant replay, but of the text, I get to stand here today and say two things to you that are absolutely crucial for you and for me as it relates to a biblical understanding of marriage.
[time=1070] Number one is this, a biblical marriage is not primarily about you.
[time=1076] And I want to just say that, I want to just get that out on the table this morning, a biblical marriage primarily is not about you.
[time=1088] And secondly, I want you to understand this and I hope you'll understand it as the morning progresses.
[time=1093] Your marriage isn't by God's design primarily for your benefit.
[time=1106] It's not about you and it's not primarily for your benefit, but that is exactly what we've done with it.
[time=1115] That is exactly what we've said by action and by word.
[time=1120] It's the message that gets communicated again and again and again.
[time=1124] The Hollywood has taken the charge, you and I have in many ways fallen right in step and we communicate to young people and old people alike that marriage is about you and it is for your benefit.
[time=1140] In God's design, which is precisely what we've committed to revisit in these weeks, marriage wasn't created.
[time=1146] Hear me.
[time=1147] Marriage wasn't created to make you happy.
[time=1152] Marriage wasn't created to be a vehicle through which all your dreams will come true.
[time=1158] Marriage wasn't primarily designed by God to fulfill you, gratify you or satisfy you.
[time=1166] It wasn't.
[time=1167] Marriage by God's design, it wasn't created to complete you.
[time=1172] And I know the novels that you read in the movies that you watch say that and communicate that again and again and again loud and clear, but it's not true.
[time=1181] It's not what God designed.
[time=1183] He didn't make marriage to complete you.
[time=1185] Christ does that.
[time=1190] Marriage wasn't set up by God to save you.
[time=1193] I can't tell you how many times I've sat in a restaurant booth with a couple.
[time=1197] I can't tell you how many times I've sat in my office with a couple contemplating thinking about planning for marriage.
[time=1204] Having given them all that I could give them, having said to them all that I could say there are even sometimes I can do it.
[time=1210] And sometimes I can remember standing on these steps, still worried about this.
[time=1218] Still concerned because it is so prevalent today that she thinks in her heart of hearts that he is going to what save her.
[time=1231] But somehow all her worries will be gone, that somehow all her struggles will disappear.
[time=1236] He can even begin to have this thought that if he can just be with her for the rest of his life, she somehow is going to make life worth living and it just doesn't happen.
[time=1248] He didn't design marriage to save you.
[time=1251] He designed Christ to save you.
[time=1256] It wasn't established to enhance you, wasn't established to strengthen you and make you better.
[time=1263] Christ does that.
[time=1267] And so you ask yourself this morning, so if marriage in God's blueprint isn't primarily supposed to fulfill, gratify, satisfy, complete, save or enhance me.
[time=1277] What in the world is it supposed to do?
[time=1283] What's it supposed to do?
[time=1286] What's the purpose of marriage?
[time=1289] You want to know the answer?
[time=1291] I want to tell you the answer.
[time=1293] I want to give you, I want to teach you the answer this morning.
[time=1295] I tell you right now, up front, I should have said this first hour, the next 15, 20 minutes, aren't going to, you came this morning knowing we were talking about marriage.
[time=1303] And a lot of you came thinking I was going to talk about giving her teddy bears and you gals cooking a good meal.
[time=1308] This is going to be a whole lot more technical.
[time=1311] This is going to, we are going to study the Bible this morning.
[time=1315] We are going to really dive in here.
[time=1317] I need your absolute focused attention for about 15 to 20 minutes and I hope the spirit of God and the word of God will reveal to you and make clear to you what he has revealed and made clear to me this last week.
[time=1330] It is absolutely powerful.
[time=1333] The answer to the question, what's it for?
[time=1338] What's the purpose in God's design of marriage?
[time=1342] He's found in the book of Ephesians.
[time=1344] You can turn there.
[time=1346] The book of Ephesians, and while I know that instantly in many of your minds you go to chapter 5 verses 22 to 33, I want to back you up a bit and we're going to look at the whole because the answer is found in the whole book of Ephesians.
[time=1362] Ephesians, as some of you know, is really divided in half. There are six chapters in the book of Ephesians.
[time=1368] And in the first three chapters, chapters 1, 2, and 3, what Paul does inspired by the spirit of God is Paul lays out for those in the church there at Ephesus and he lays out for those of you and for me here in this setting as well.
[time=1383] He gives us our position in Christ.
[time=1388] The first three chapters are all about what God has done for you through Christ by making available to you the salvation that you've encountered.
[time=1400] The first three chapters are all about what God has done and provided for you in terms of your salvation and now the opportunity you have to be a child of God.
[time=1411] It is three chapters absolutely packed with what he has provided you and what that means in terms of your place and his family. It's an incredible, incredible read.
[time=1422] 1, 2, and 3 then leads our position, then leads to chapters 4, 5, and 6, chapters 4, 5, and 6, which is really our practice.
[time=1433] We have our position who we are in Christ, all that he has brought to us, and then chapters 4, 5, and 6 is how to live all that out in the everyday of your life, what we should do, how we should live, our practice.
[time=1449] 1, 2, and 3, our position as children of God, chapters 4, 5, and 6, our practice, how we should live. If you went underneath all of that and just really took it all in and assigned to the book of Ephesians and overall purpose, the purpose would be found actually in chapter 3, verse 8.
[time=1469] This is what he wanted them to begin to understand that the gospel was going forward. It wasn't just for the Jews anymore. In chapter 3, verse 8 to me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given to preach to the, say it church out loud.
[time=1492] Do you know what a Gentile is? Let's just stop there real quick.
[time=1497] Do you know what a Gentile is? Do you understand in this context who he would have been referring to when he talked about Gentiles, he was talking about non-Jews, he was talking about those who didn't know the Lord?
[time=1514] He's talking about those on the outside, looking in. These are unbelievers. These are people who haven't fully surrendered their hearts and lives to Christ.
[time=1529] And here Paul in 3.8 gives us really the biggest picture to preach to the Gentiles, the endless treasures of Christ. This is where it's all going. This is where it's all heading.
[time=1543] I love what you learn when you read and study chapters 1, 2, and 3 of Ephesians. Just listen and allow this to encourage you this morning.
[time=1552] In chapter 1, if you wanted to write this down, you could write down verses 3 through 14, for you see in chapter 1, verses 3 to 14, you'll learn that you've been spiritually chosen.
[time=1563] You've been adopted, you've been redeemed and forgiven by a grace that's been lavished upon you, Paul says.
[time=1571] You've been granted a spiritual, eternal inheritance. You've been sealed, made, sound and secure with the Holy Spirit of God. Talk about position. Wow.
[time=1584] Look what he's done for you. Chapter 2, you learn that you were dead in your sin. You weren't struggling in your sin. You weren't wrestling with your sin. You were dead in your sin.
[time=1596] Chapter 2, verses 1 through 20, and God made you alive through Christ by faith, not by your works. God saved you. It says there in chapter 2 that as an unbeliever, you used to be separated from God. You were excluded from God. You were strangers to God.
[time=1614] And yet now, yet now, because of Christ, you can actually be a part of His family, part of the family of God. In chapter 3, we learn that you now have supernatural strength.
[time=1627] You really do. In relationship with Christ, according to God's Word, you've been infused with supernatural strength, the Holy Spirit of God.
[time=1638] You've been given power, divine power in the inner man, it says. Christ, it says in chapter 3, literally dwells within you.
[time=1649] All of that, stay with me. All of that, chapters 1, 2, and 3, leads to chapters 4, 5, and 6. All of which, 4, 5, and 6. All of which in the flow of the book, those three chapters are saying, now, here's how we're going to reach them.
[time=1665] Here's how we're going to practice our position. Here's how we're going to take the endless treasures of Christ and make them available to an on-looking world, chapters 4, 5, and 6, how real believers practice a very real faith.
[time=1680] And in the process, reach and rescue Gentiles, reach and rescue others in a very real way. Okay, here it comes. And so right there, right there in the midst of chapters 4, 5, and 6, toward the end of chapter 5, we have this section dealing with husbands and wives.
[time=1704] And a sudden right there at the end of 5, we get this section on marriage, this classical biblical text on marriage, 5, 22. Many of you have read this. Many of you have seen this for years and years, wives.
[time=1721] Be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ also is the head of the church, he himself being the Savior of the body, but as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything.
[time=1741] Husbands, love your wives just as Christ also loved the church and gave himself up for her so that he might sanctify her, his bride, the church having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word that he Christ might present to himself, his bride, the church and all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and blameless.
[time=1767] Husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church because we are members of the body. For this reason, a man, verse 31, a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh.
[time=1792] His mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church, husband and wife, Christ and the church. Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife, even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband.
[time=1815] Now for years and years and years, we've read those 11 verses and we have concluded that that right there is about having a great marriage.
[time=1828] That's sort of the end game that we've all kind of landed at, that 22 to 33 is primarily about having a great marriage.
[time=1838] We think that, we read that, we think, you know what, those verses right there are, that's about how to connect with, that's about how to care for, that's about how to reach each other.
[time=1851] And I would humbly stand here today and submit to you this morning that it's not primarily about that. It isn't.
[time=1869] I would submit to you this morning that foundation only Ephesians 5, 22 to 33, God's design for marriage isn't about reaching each other. It's about reaching Gentiles.
[time=1882] Those who don't know him.
[time=1886] As it relates, bear with me, I'm going to show you here, watch. As it relates to the contextual flow of the chapter, the great truth of verses 22 to 33, this marriage section is that this passage shows us how to accomplish two very important endeavors,
[time=1907] two really big deals, two things that we're introduced to at the very beginning of chapter five. The marriage passage shows us that marriage is first and foremost about number one.
[time=1923] Go back to Ephesians 5, 1 and 2, here you go. Ephesians 5, 1 and 2, which is really where this whole passage, if you will, starts, says in Ephesians 5, 1 and 2, therefore Paul talking to the whole church, everybody.
[time=1940] He says, everybody be imitators of God as beloved children and walk in love just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us and offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.
[time=1959] Imitate God and imitate be just like Christ who offered Himself up this worshipful sacrifice, this fragrant aroma.
[time=1973] My friend's marriage is first and foremost about the reflective Christ-like worship of God. I want you to write that down.
[time=1984] Marriage is first and foremost about the reflective. When I say reflective, I don't mean thoughtful. By reflective, I mean reflecting.
[time=1992] We're supposed to imitate Him. As we imitate Him, we reflect Him to others. And this whole chapter begins with this call from Paul for everybody to, in a reflective way, be a people who are worshiping God, offering, making much of God.
[time=2013] Lifting up the name and the reputation of God. This is where this begins. And then he goes on in verse 8. He goes on in verse 8, the second foundational statement for this whole chapter.
[time=2031] In Ephesians 5.8 it says, for you were formally darkness. But now Ephesians, now church at Black Hawk, now you are light in the world. Walk, live, choose value. Walk as children of light.
[time=2052] Worship God. Make much of God foundational. Very beginning here. Most important stuff. Worship God. And be people who shed light. Be the light of the Lord.
[time=2065] He says, Ephesians 5.1 and 2, Ephesians 5.8. It's about the reflective Christlike worship of God. And it's about walking, living as lights in a very dark world.
[time=2082] What's marriage supposed to do? Look at the flow of the chapter. 5.1 and 2. Bring worship to God. Be like Christ. Bring worship to God. And walk as children of light.
[time=2097] I want you to notice that these are commands. The two main commands found at the beginning of the chapter.
[time=2104] And at the outset, these two main commands establish the direction. They establish the theme of everything that will come after that.
[time=2114] These two commands establish the flow of the chapter. Everything that comes after 5.1 and 2 in verse 8 answers, if you will, the question of the reader.
[time=2124] And the question of the reader is this. I want to imitate God. I want to offer worship to God. Okay. I'm buying in. I want to be a godly light. How?
[time=2134] How, Paul? How can we as believers here? Total room. All of us. How can we imitate God? Bring worship to God and be a people who give light to a world that desperately needs it.
[time=2147] And he says, I'm thankful that you asked. Let me answer. Look at verse 11. Here we go. Verse 11. Don't participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness.
[time=2158] But instead expose them. Look how Paul does it. You imitate God and worship him. You share the light of the Lord when you choose not to participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness.
[time=2172] Verse 11 and following. And he keeps going. Ephesians 5, 15 and 16. Be careful how you walk. Not as unwise men, but as wise, making the most of your day when you walk.
[time=2188] Listen, when you walk each day governed by wisdom, God gets worshiped and light gets shined. You want to bring worship to God. You want to be a light that makes a difference in your life.
[time=2201] He makes a difference in your world. 5, 18. He just keeps going. Don't get drunk with wine. But instead be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[time=2213] You want to worship God. You want to be a fragrant aroma. You want to make much of him. You want to be a light in a world that's dark.
[time=2222] Wives, verse 22, all of a sudden, 30 minutes goes by an hour at the marriage passage. And here's your answer.
[time=2233] You want to worship God. You want to bring light to a dark world. Wives, be subject to your own husbands as you would to the Lord.
[time=2251] Your God is that big and that good and that great. And He's got you. And your world is in desperate need of that picture, of trust and obedience.
[time=2273] Wives, be subject to respect your husbands as you would the Lord.
[time=2278] Husbands, you want to make much of God as part of the church, as part of his bride husbands. You want to bring worship to God and shine light in a very, very dark world.
[time=2291] Love your wives in the same way Christ loved the church. So let me get this straight. So when wives respectfully come alongside husbands.
[time=2310] And by the way, that respectfully, I know what we've done. I understand what we've done with respect. Over the years, we've kind of reclassified and recategorized.
[time=2323] We've done our own thing with this word. As it relates to this word, in this text, you and I are quick to say, well, yeah, yeah, respect him.
[time=2336] But we add to that respect him when he earns it. And just to be clear, the word here respect in this text is free from what you and I have done to it.
[time=2349] This word says respect him. Just like it says love her unconditionally, just like it says love her no matter what, just like it says love her on her good days and her bad days, just like it says love her the way Christ loved you and you know Christ loved you on a bad day.
[time=2370] Same exact thing. Respect, unconditional. You just do it. You do it because you trust in your God, maybe more than you trust in your husband, but you do it because it's God's design.
[time=2384] And it reflects a great worship and a great sense of trust to him and it gives a light that is absolutely blinding to a world that sees that and goes, wow, why would she do that?
[time=2401] So let me get this straight. When wives respectfully come alongside husbands and when a husband makes that easy and guys are supposed to make that easy by sacrificially loving his wife, according to the whole of Ephesians 5, God receives worship and the light of the Lord gets shown on others.
[time=2423] Wow, that's just good Bible study that you just did right there. We just studied the Bible and saw what it had to say.
[time=2439] So marriage, you see, isn't about you too. It's about God. And as simple as the sounds, it really is revolutionary in some ways. The focus of your marriage should be him.
[time=2453] The focus of your marriage should be him and you and I, we have for years and years and those who have gone before us have for years and years, we've made the focus of our marriage, us.
[time=2466] We've made the focus of our marriage, our issues. We've made the focus of our marriage, what we're not getting. We've made the focus of our marriage, what he's not doing.
[time=2474] We've made the focus of our marriage, him, him, him, her, her, year 5, year 10, year 15, year 20. The focus has remained the same and for years and years and years and years, this couple goes on.
[time=2486] And the focus and the breadth of what they're about and what they think about and talk about and articulate, it's all about them.
[time=2496] And God says no. It's not about, primarily, it's not about you. It's about me.
[time=2507] Firstly, and secondly, primarily, marriage has not been given to you for your benefit.
[time=2515] It, marriage is supposed to reach others with his light for their benefit. Do you understand this?
[time=2526] What you're learning today, what you're seeing today is that one of the primary purposes of your marriage is evangelism.
[time=2533] One of the primary purposes of your marriage is to reach and courage. Help give hope to others who would see you living out your faith in the midst of your relationship in a worshipful way to God to shed light to an on-looking world.
[time=2549] In Matthew 5, 14 through 16, some of you know this, others of you, you don't. The idea of light is all over the scriptures.
[time=2559] I want you to see it this morning just briefly because your marriage is supposed to be like this. Your marriage is to be classified like this.
[time=2568] Your marriage is to be characterized by light. It says in Matthew 5, 14, you are the light of the world.
[time=2575] Go ahead and insert marriage there. Just for the sake of our discussion this morning, you, your marriage is the light of the world.
[time=2582] A city, a marriage set on a hill can't be hidden, nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket.
[time=2589] You don't get married and then hide, but on the lampstand is where it goes and it gives light to all who are in the house.
[time=2599] Let your marriage let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works and glorify.
[time=2608] Here comes the worship and glorify your father who is in heaven. The idea of worship to God and the light of the Lord inextricably linked all throughout scripture.
[time=2621] Second Corinthians, this won't be on the screen. I thought about this just a few minutes ago. Second Corinthians 4.
[time=2631] Second Corinthians 4, 6, says for God, for God who said light shall shine out of what? Say it. You're not even reading it and you know what the word is, darkness.
[time=2644] For God who said light shall shine out of darkness is the one who has shown in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
[time=2657] Please be reminded this morning my friends that biblically we see that light, yes it does, it does accomplish the function of illuminating.
[time=2666] Yes, light does illumine, it lights up, but light also all the way through scripture. It also attracts. Light attracts.
[time=2680] Light makes a, it makes a way, it invites, it invites with hope, creates a path for people to walk.
[time=2690] And this is what your marriage is to accomplish. So stop, stop teaching little girls that all you want someday is the right guy to come along who will be the one to finally make her happy.
[time=2709] Because it's not supposed to be that way. Don't teach her that. No fallen broken man is going to make her ultimately happy. Christ will do that.
[time=2724] And you can model that for her and you can help her understand that. Doesn't mean marriage is bad. Doesn't mean men are jerks. It means keep it in perspective. What's this thing about?
[time=2735] And stop telling boys that marriage is mainly about finally getting to do something. Finally getting to have something. Don't teach them that. Don't talk that way.
[time=2750] No, instead teach them that it's this great divinely given opportunity to give. That it's this great privileged blessing within which they get to offer themselves, even to others.
[time=2765] And as it relates to the light, we should ask couples, we really should, maybe we'll start doing this around here. Maybe I'll start doing this with you. Maybe you should start doing this with me. Maybe we should ask couples married two years, married five years, married ten, fifteen, twenty five, fifty years.
[time=2780] Maybe we should start asking couples who is God reaching with the gospel through the light of your marriage. Who's he reaching? Through the light of your marriage, your worship of God, your extending of the light.
[time=2802] Let me say this as we close. Some of you, some of you married in this room this morning aren't reaching many Gentiles.
[time=2815] For some of you, if a Gentile is somebody who doesn't know the Lord, for some of you, you're not reaching many of them because you don't know many of them.
[time=2825] Because you don't spend much time with, they wouldn't even have the opportunity to see the light of the gospel through the loving relationship you and your spouse have.
[time=2837] Because you're just never around them. And many of you in the room this morning need to give that some thought. Not because they're a project, but because you love them.
[time=2848] And you'd want what's best for them. And you would desire to be used of God to fulfill one of the main purposes of marriage, to reach them in a meaningful, genuine way.
[time=2865] For too many of you in the room this morning, you're not reaching a lot of Gentiles in your marriage because your marriage just doesn't have much light.
[time=2879] You're not loving her like Christ loved you. And you're not respecting him in the way that God has empowered you and made you able to.
[time=2894] There are a number of things in those 11 verses that we'll come back to next week, practical things that I believe every one of us, married or unmarried can benefit from.
[time=2904] But before we get to that, I wanted you to see the bigger picture this morning. But this isn't about us and it's not about what we get, it's about him and how marriage can be used to further the kingdom in a wonderful God honoring way.
[time=2919] And so I hope this morning that your heart has been open. I hope this morning that in your soul you've been encouraged and I would invite you this morning as Corbin and the team lead us, let's close our time together and worship.
[time=2933] Let's worship our God together.
[time=2939] [MUSIC]
[time=2945] Can we stand together and sing this?
[time=2948] [MUSIC]
[time=2951] Lord, I come, I confess, now in King, I find my rest. Without you, I fall apart. You're the one that guides my heart.
[time=2977] [MUSIC]
[time=2981] Lord, I need you, all I need you. Every hour I need you.
[time=2994] My heart, defense, my righteousness, oh God, I need you.
[time=3010] Your grace is more. Your grace is found. It is where you are. And where you are, Lord, I am free.
[time=3029] Holyness is Christ in me. It's where you are. For I am free. Holyness is Christ in me.
[time=3052] Lord, I need you, all I need you. Every hour I need you. My heart, defense, my righteousness, oh God, I need you.
[time=3081] Your love never fails, it never gives up. Never runs out on me. Your love never fails, it never gives up.
[time=3091] Never runs out on me. Your love never fails, it never gives up. Never runs out on me.
[time=3101] Your love, and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[time=3114] It's all around the times, my soul. And I never ever have to be afraid. This one thing remains.
[time=3133] Your love never fails, it never gives up. Never runs out on me. Your love never fails, it never gives up. Never runs out on me.
[time=3153] Your love, and on and on and on and on.
[time=3170] Lord, I need you, all I need you. Every hour I need you. My one defense, my righteousness, oh God, how I need you.
[time=3228] You know, I was thinking sitting down there that Ephesus, this city that this letter came to, was this place that was as debauched and immoral as scarred by the world and it's thinking that you could ever imagine.
[time=3250] Wives were beaten, temple prostitutes took care of the needs of any man all under the name of religion. It was immoral, it was disgusting, it was despicable.
[time=3265] Women were treated like dirt and marriage was an absolute joke. Sound familiar? It's the same way today as it was in Ephesus and watch this, the church.
[time=3283] The church then made this enormous impact because God's word came and it told husbands to love their wives. And it said to wives, I know it's tough, but give yourself to him.
[time=3302] We're not talking about him beating you, we're not talking about things of that nature, we're talking about a marriage committed to God that runs into real difficulties and challenges.
[time=3310] But still in that culture it was completely anti-culture and this message breaks through and husbands and wives begin to come together and God has worshiped and a light gets shown and it changes their world.
[time=3327] And these truths can change our world. If your marriage, if your relationship is willing to live with this perspective, with your heads bowed and your eyes closed, I'm going to let you go but I want to pray for you before we go, with your heads bowed and your eyes closed.
[time=3343] If you're married, if you're doing really well in marriage or you're really struggling in your marriage either way, if you're newly married or you've been married for years, if there's any married people in this room and you want to be prayed for, I want you just to lift your hand up as if you were lifting it up in worship.
[time=3365] And with your hand lifted up, I want to just say a prayer for you this morning. As elders, we care deeply about your condition. We want to do our best to love and care for and shepherd you in this morning, I want to just do that through a prayer.
[time=3380] And so with your hand lifted up, go ahead, there you go, with your hands lifted up, let me just say this prayer, "Oh Father in Heaven, you see these hands this morning and you know the hearts and the souls, you know the homes and the lives that are connected to these hands." So God, you know it all.
[time=3399] And I pray this morning that you would in a powerful way, through your word and through your spirit and through your presence, God through your church, that you would encourage these husbands and wives, that today they would begin to get an even clearer picture of why it is you have them together.
[time=3420] Oh God, I pray that their motivation would more and more and more so in the days to come move off of themselves toward you. And oh God, as we focus on you in our marriage, as we focus on obeying you first, worshiping you.
[time=3438] Oh God, may you take our obedience and our trust and our devotion and our worship of you. And will you allow that to permeate our relationship? Will you allow that to give us the opportunity to be a light unto others and even to each other?
[time=3456] Oh God, give us strength and courage to show respect when difficult, to show sacrificial love when we're offended. Oh God, I pray that you would be with those who stand here today in honesty with their hands held high because they want your help and they need your guidance.
[time=3475] We'll be back together again next week as we look even more practically into how we live all this stuff out. Even as we begin to talk about parenting, we pray God bring us back together. And everybody agreed with the prayer and said, Amen. God bless you. We'll see you next week.
