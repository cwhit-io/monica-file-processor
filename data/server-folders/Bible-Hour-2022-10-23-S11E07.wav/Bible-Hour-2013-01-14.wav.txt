[time=0] You
[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=61] Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=63] It's great to be with you.
[time=64] I am so grateful for these moments and thankful today that my good friend Rod Ovid is here with me.
[time=69] If you've watched the Bible Hour at all in recent years, you know that Rod is not only a great friend and part of our family here at Blackhawk, but Rod and Carolyn, his wife, have founded Lagos Institute of Biblical Studies, a tremendous opportunity for people all over this region to get educated, to get taught, to get encouraged, to have the word of God and the great truths of doctrine instilled into their hearts and minds.
[time=96] And Rod and I are here today to tell you about a brand new expansion opportunity connected with Lagos.
[time=103] And I'll just say this and I'm going to have Rod say a couple things.
[time=106] I'm so grateful for our friend Jim Bradley.
[time=108] Absolutely.
[time=109] Jim Bradley is a part of our Blackhawk family and Jim and Linda have been part of our Blackhawk family for years.
[time=116] Century 21, Bradley.
[time=118] You see the signs all over town.
[time=121] Jim has done a tremendous job of growing a God-honoring business, and they have a new location out on DuPont and '69.
[time=129] And there at the Century 21, Bradley Offices, Jim has built what he calls the...
[time=136] Media Center.
[time=137] The Bradley, the Century 21, Bradley Media Center.
[time=140] And it is quite a media center.
[time=143] And in that media center, he has agreed to allow Lagos to open up a night-class extension.
[time=151] There are already Lagos classes going on in different parts of the region.
[time=156] But Rod's going to tell you about what's going on there, starting soon.
[time=159] Very soon.
[time=160] In fact, Tuesday, February 19th will be starting there.
[time=164] We have classes Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday throughout the region.
[time=168] Tuesdays will be opening up at the Century 21, Bradley Media Center.
[time=172] You go in through the main door.
[time=174] And it's like Kelly said, it's right there near DuPont and '69 in that shopping center.
[time=180] You can't miss it, big letters.
[time=182] And the exciting thing is we're going to start fresh out there.
[time=186] For all the churches up there, including Auburn, can come down.
[time=190] I mean, all those places.
[time=191] Absolutely.
[time=192] And for you pastors that are, you know, catching this on Sunday morning, invite those in your church to come to this.
[time=200] This is a non-church-based program.
[time=202] We're having it at a neutral location.
[time=204] Yeah.
[time=205] And it's an opportunity for them to get the education that you as pastors have gotten.
[time=210] This is a real baccalaureate program.
[time=212] And we're starting there at six o'clock with the New Testament survey.
[time=216] And we actually go from the intertestamental period.
[time=219] We talk about a canonization of Scripture, then the New Testament.
[time=223] And at 730 will be the Old Testament survey.
[time=226] And so it's a real base for all of the believers in your church, especially those that might be in eldership training, Sunday school teachers, people that could really use some of the context, some of the scholarship that goes along with the Bible study.
[time=241] So again, the media center at the Century 21 Bradley Complex, they're at DuPont and I-69 and six o'clock and $7.35 a class.
[time=253] Tuesday, February 19th.
[time=255] That's when we're starting.
[time=256] Hope you got that.
[time=257] Tuesday, February 19th.
[time=259] Two classes each Tuesday night.
[time=262] Again, all of you in northwest Fort Wayne, Auburn, Angola.
[time=266] I can't wait for you to experience good, strong, biblical, theological, doctrinal teaching that will change and shape your life.
[time=274] I'm so grateful for the Obits and Logos.
[time=276] And I can't wait for you to experience it as well.
[time=278] God bless you.
[time=279] Thanks for tuning in.
[time=280] (music playing)
[time=300] Well, I am so grateful to get to be here with all of you this morning.
[time=305] So looking forward to what I believe God has for each and every one of you.
[time=311] As Chris plays, I want to give you an opportunity here as we start in on really a second week at God's Design for Marriage.
[time=319] If you're joining us, we're in the midst of a series that we've entitled "Modern Families." We believe the ancient truth of God's Word has huge application in the everyday of this modern world.
[time=333] And this morning, we come back to the issue of marriage.
[time=335] And I want to just encourage those of you who are married in the room today, young or old, newly or seasoned.
[time=344] Those of you who think about maybe someday being married.
[time=348] Or maybe you're married again.
[time=350] Maybe for whatever reason you find yourself with the opportunity to come back at this thing called marriage.
[time=356] And so whatever your circumstance.
[time=358] I want to just read God's Word to you this morning.
[time=361] If you want to just bow your heads and close your eyes you can, we're not going to take long.
[time=368] I want to just get the Word of God into your heart and into your mind and into your soul this morning.
[time=373] And so bow your heads, close your eyes, or follow along on the screen, it's fine.
[time=377] But this is just my hope, my prayers, the Spirit of God would take this and lay a foundation for our talk this morning.
[time=383] Husbands and wives.
[time=386] Whatever you do or say.
[time=390] Whatever you do or say do it as a representative of the Lord Jesus.
[time=395] It says in Colossians 3.
[time=398] Wives submit to your husbands as is fitting for those who belong to the Lord.
[time=404] And husbands love your wives and never treat them.
[time=409] Never treat them harshly.
[time=413] Children always obey your parents for this pleases the Lord.
[time=418] And fathers do not aggravate or exasperate your children or they will become discouraged.
[time=429] It goes on in 1 Peter 3 1 and 2 it says in the same way you wives here in the room this morning must accept the authority of your husband then even if some refuse to obey the good news.
[time=442] Your godly lives, wives will speak to them without any words.
[time=450] They will be won over by observing your pure and reverent lives.
[time=457] Husbands.
[time=459] Husbands in the same way must give honor to your wives, treat your wife with understanding as you live together she may be weaker than you but she is your equal partner in God's gift of new life.
[time=473] Treat her as you should so your prayers will not be hindered.
[time=478] We looked at this a couple weeks ago.
[time=483] Husbands, wives imitate God.
[time=486] Therefore in everything you do because you are his dear children.
[time=493] Live a life filled with love following the example of Christ husbands and wives.
[time=498] He loved us and offered himself as a sacrifice for us.
[time=503] A pleasing aroma to God.
[time=507] Husbands and wives for once you were full of darkness but now now you have light from the Lord so live as people of light.
[time=517] So again I say, each man must love his wife as he loves
[time=525] himself and the wife must respect her husband.
[time=530] Church, how is this possible?
[time=533] How do we do this?
[time=535] Don't be drunk with wine.
[time=537] Don't be filled up with anything other than the who.
[time=542] Spirit, don't be drunk with wine because that will ruin your life.
[time=548] Instead be filled with the Holy Spirit of God.
[time=553] Oh Father in Heaven.
[time=555] My prayer this morning is that right here in this moment that for those in the room who have fully surrendered their hearts and lives to you oh God for those in the room that know you for those who live in a broken but yet redeemed relationship with you which is so many of us in this room God.
[time=578] Would you fill us with your spirit again?
[time=581] Would you fill us up this morning so that your word can do its miraculous life changing work?
[time=589] May the spirit of God and the word of God as we come back to our families and our marriages this morning do its mighty work and the people in the room agreed and said amen.
[time=601] [AMEN] Thank you Chris.
[time=603] Thanks to Chris and to Lindsay for leading us in worship this morning.
[time=607] What a great beginning to our day.
[time=609] Tim Keller and his wife Kathy Keller recently wrote a book the meaning of marriage.
[time=614] I'd highly recommend it.
[time=616] Tim and Kathy Keller on the meaning of marriage.
[time=619] He says at the outset of the book he says I am tired of listening to sentimental talks on marriage.
[time=627] This won't be one of those by the way.
[time=630] That weddings in church and in Sunday school much of what I hear on the subject has as much depth as a hallmark card.
[time=638] While marriage is many things it is anything but sentimental.
[time=644] Marriage is glorious but hard.
[time=646] It's a burning joy and strength and yet it is also blood, sweat and tears humbling defeats and exhausting victories.
[time=655] [AMEN] I love how he said that.
[time=658] Humbling defeats and exhausting victories.
[time=661] No marriage I know more than a few weeks old could be described as a fairy tale come true.
[time=667] Therefore it is not surprising that the only phrase in Paul's famous discourse on marriage in Ephesians 5 that many couples can relate to is verse 32 where it says of marriage at the end of that verse this marriage is a profound mystery.
[time=686] A profound mystery.
[time=690] Sometimes you fall into bed after a long hard day of trying to understand each other and you can only sigh this is all very mysterious.
[time=700] At times your marriage seems to be an unsolved puzzle, a maze in which you honestly feel lost.
[time=706] I believe all of this and yet there's no relationship between human beings that is greater or more important than marriage.
[time=714] In the Bible's account God himself officiates at the first wedding and when the man sees the woman he breaks into poetry
[time=723] and exclaims at last.
[time=727] Some versions say whoa.
[time=730] It's an amazing scene.
[time=732] Everything in the text proclaims that marriage next to our relationship to God is the most profound relationship there is.
[time=741] And that is why like knowing God himself coming to know and love your spouse is difficult and painful yet rewarding and wondrous.
[time=752] The most painful and the most wonderful.
[time=757] This is the biblical understanding of marriage and there has never been.
[time=763] There has never been a more important time than now to lift it up and give it prominence and priority in our culture.
[time=776] And oh how it needs lifting up in our modern culture.
[time=782] Marriage has been taking a beating for years and in recent days the punches just keep coming.
[time=788] Pick your pole.
[time=790] Gallop, Barnum, Wall Street Journal, USA Today over 50% of all marriages in America end in divorce.
[time=799] Over 50% more than half of all marriages are failing.
[time=803] In 1960 just for a perspective sake 15% of marriages were
[time=810] failing in 1960.
[time=813] What has happened?
[time=817] I'm asking you to think about that here just for a moment.
[time=819] What happened?
[time=822] What do you think happened in these past 50 years to this once
[time=829] solid and sound institution called marriage?
[time=835] Many would say and I would agree that the demise of marriage is directly tied to the clear and blatant decline of morals and values.
[time=845] Morals and values arguably even biblical morals and values once deeply embedded in our society.
[time=856] And now no longer.
[time=858] Now no longer embedded in our culture.
[time=862] Who's to blame?
[time=865] Who or what would we blame for this 50-year slide?
[time=871] Where to begin?
[time=873] It's a pretty long list.
[time=875] You could start with pornography.
[time=879] You could start there.
[time=881] Pornography with its insidious capacity to darken and
[time=887] deaden and distract a mind and a soul 68 to 70 million
[time=895] hits a day on the Internet.
[time=898] 68 to 70 million hits a day.
[time=901] We're talking photographs, videos and downloads.
[time=905] 68 to 70 million a day.
[time=908] Oh, the private world.
[time=911] Oh, the private world of a laptop.
[time=916] A businessman's laptop.
[time=919] A stay-at-home mom's laptop.
[time=924] Highest-growing demographic today in the pornography arena women between the ages of 30 and 45.
[time=931] True stat.
[time=934] Oh, the private world of a 16-year-old boy.
[time=938] 21-year-old girl.
[time=942] The decline of morals and values once embedded.
[time=947] Social media, which isn't all evil, it's not all bad.
[time=952] God's using social media today to do wonderful things and connect people in wonderful ways.
[time=958] But there is the flip side of that.
[time=960] Social media and its increased capacity in recent days to now connect you with the one who truly understands you.
[time=969] And now this is being done in a uniquely nostalgic way you've heard about the most recent growing marriage killing trend in social media, haven't you?
[time=980] That's right.
[time=981] Years of marriage families with young and growing kids, friends, jobs, entire lives all are now being abandoned for old
[time=990] high school sweethearts found on where?
[time=995] Facebook.
[time=997] It's true.
[time=999] It's a reality.
[time=1000] Divorce rates, they're being able to track this now, are climbing as people reconnect with high school sweethearts and leave everything in their wake.
[time=1012] It's as if with one loud voice America is saying, "I don't like my life anymore.
[time=1018] I want a different one." Which is code for saying, "I don't want to live anymore with responsibilities of the choices I've made.
[time=1028] And so I'm going to hose everybody I know." Which makes you want to ask the question, at least it does me, so you'll dump your spouse and create ripples and hurts that'll never heal.
[time=1042] You'll abandon your kids, leave everything in every one deer so you can what?
[time=1051] And I asked this this morning because I believe there are people in this room considering this.
[time=1058] Oh, don't kid yourself.
[time=1060] There are those in this room who have thought this, who are thinking this, who may even be in the midst of doing this.
[time=1068] And I would ask you so that you can have what?
[time=1075] Swap out one set of heartbreaking issues for another new set
[time=1081] of heartbreaking issues.
[time=1083] And as one woman literally looked me in the eye recently and said to me, "She said to me, you don't understand." I said, "Well, then enlighten me." She said, "You don't get it.
[time=1093] I've reconnected with him.
[time=1095] We're soulmates and we have now established connection at the deepest level to which I wanted to say.
[time=1103] I didn't, I wanted to say.
[time=1107] Well, so now what are you going to do?
[time=1110] I've told your books and follow Foreigner and R.E.O.
[time=1113] Speedwagon around on tour.
[time=1115] I mean, what are you going to do?
[time=1120] 70% of those, 70% of those relationships I just described are failing.
[time=1127] Next year it'll be 80.
[time=1129] Following year it'll be 90 because about a year down the road with this soulmate that really gets you, you wake up and look at him or her and say, "You know, there's a reason I broke up in 11th grade." The decline, all the decline of long-standing morals and values.
[time=1151] Living together, living together.
[time=1155] We should talk about it.
[time=1157] I think it's in the mix.
[time=1159] I think it's something worth just some discussion on as we come back to God's design.
[time=1165] And to be clear, please, to be clear, when you hear me talk about living together, there is no chapter and verse on sharing a same address.
[time=1174] None.
[time=1175] There are a lot of chapters and verses though that deal with and give us God's design for the sexual-physical relationship between a man and a woman.
[time=1188] So issue number one on the living together really is this idea of intimacy before being married.
[time=1194] God, please hear me.
[time=1196] I'm not an old dude.
[time=1198] I know my hair's getting gray and I kind of dress old now, but I'm still pretty in touch, you guys, really.
[time=1205] I know what goes on.
[time=1206] I understand the gig.
[time=1207] I see how it all plays out.
[time=1208] I've been around for 26 years doing this.
[time=1211] I'm just telling you, he won't bless it.
[time=1217] He doesn't.
[time=1218] He won't bless it.
[time=1221] If you're doing it, stop.
[time=1225] Honor God.
[time=1226] Change something up.
[time=1227] Take whatever steps you might need to take.
[time=1229] Let us help.
[time=1230] We'll help.
[time=1231] This isn't a beat down in here this morning.
[time=1233] We're just simply trying to help us understand there is a design that he has given us and there is blessing within that design.
[time=1241] Some will say to me, we're going to live together, but we're not going to sleep together, to which I do what you just did.
[time=1249] I say, of course you will.
[time=1252] Of course you will.
[time=1255] And at worst, or at best if you don't, you're going to spend every night of your life in temptation, which makes the relationship then about temptation and it makes her about temptation and him about temptation.
[time=1269] It's not how you want to live your life.
[time=1272] Do it under God's design.
[time=1276] Living together.
[time=1279] There are millions and millions more 18 to 30 year olds living together before or in lieu of marriage today than there was in that same demographic in 1970s, sexually, emotionally, financially and socially united before marriage.
[time=1294] And they say, and listen, they, they say, they is us.
[time=1301] More and more believing Christ following professing to be
[time=1307] Christian young men and women are doing this at a record pace
[time=1314] compared to even 10 years ago in believing culture.
[time=1318] They want to give sex and intimacy and trust and life together.
[time=1322] They call it a test run.
[time=1326] It's like they're buying a car.
[time=1329] That's where marriage has kind of come to.
[time=1332] It's like buying a new set of wheels.
[time=1334] And so they set up a world basically full of selfish taking on an issue God designed to be full of self less giving.
[time=1346] And I would ask not sarcastically or in a mean spirit, I would just ask honestly, how's that working out forum these days?
[time=1357] Most of those who live together prior to marriage after getting married are divorced in the first five years and usually in the first five years due to unfaithfulness.
[time=1370] Most of those who live together prior to marriage are getting divorced within the first five years than those who waited.
[time=1380] Which makes sense.
[time=1381] I tell couples living in the heartache of this scenario, of unfaithfulness within the first five years, having started out by living together.
[time=1391] I tell them again, I say it lovingly.
[time=1393] She slept with you when you weren't her husband.
[time=1398] Why are you so shocked that she's done it again?
[time=1403] Or he's done it again.
[time=1405] This really isn't a mystery.
[time=1411] It's why it's not called the test run bed.
[time=1417] Hebrews calls it the marriage bed.
[time=1421] And there's a reason.
[time=1422] Hebrews 13, 4, you can see it on the screen.
[time=1425] I love how it starts.
[time=1426] It says marriage is to be held in what?
[time=1428] Say it, Church.
[time=1429] Honor, say it louder.
[time=1431] Marriage is to be held up.
[time=1433] Marriage is a big deal.
[time=1434] God's designed for marriage.
[time=1435] Marriage is to be held up in honor.
[time=1438] It's like marriage.
[time=1440] It's way up there.
[time=1442] And the marriage bed, and you know what that means.
[time=1447] The marriage bed is to be undefiled.
[time=1451] And you say, well, great.
[time=1454] I already defiled it.
[time=1456] I understand.
[time=1458] That's why it's such great news.
[time=1460] That's why we call it the good news.
[time=1463] That's why it's so good that I get to tell you today that God is a God of the second chance, that God is a God who redeems you and frees you from your failure.
[time=1470] That God is a God who's willing to take a repentant heart and give it a new opportunity.
[time=1475] And He takes your sin and He throws it into the deepest part of the ocean.
[time=1478] It's as far as the east is from the west.
[time=1480] It's absolutely gone and you get to start what?
[time=1483] Over.
[time=1485] If you need to.
[time=1487] Do it.
[time=1491] Keep the marriage bed undefiled for fornicators.
[time=1495] This is very important.
[time=1496] For fornicators and adulterers, God will judge.
[time=1500] See what we've done in cultures.
[time=1502] We've tried to change the language.
[time=1504] We're just taking it for a spin.
[time=1506] No, you're committing immorality.
[time=1509] You're committing fornication.
[time=1512] You're destroying God's design.
[time=1515] And that doesn't happen without consequence.
[time=1521] Don't do it.
[time=1523] Hold marriage up high.
[time=1526] The decline of long-standing morals and values.
[time=1530] What else could we point to today?
[time=1532] In this modern culture of ours, here's one.
[time=1534] More and more husbands and wives are living lives more and more distant from each other.
[time=1540] You've seen it.
[time=1542] Instead of rich, deep relationship, both emotionally and physically, instead of a growing friendship and an increased spiritual bond, couples today are living separate and detached lives with little if any intimacy at all.
[time=1562] Jobs are more important than marital closeness.
[time=1565] Kids and schedules can become more important than marital closeness.
[time=1570] Materialism, the pursuit of more stuff, can become more important than marital closeness.
[time=1576] Marriage is failing.
[time=1584] It's all very sad, very messy, and yes, the issue of declining morals
[time=1590] and values is certainly in the mix.
[time=1593] But there's a deeper, bigger issue when looking into the devastating
[time=1599] slide and failure of marriage and family over the past 50 years.
[time=1607] You want to know what it is?
[time=1609] It's a much bigger issue than even those things that we've described.
[time=1615] It's related, but it is foundational and huge, and it is this.
[time=1619] We have secularized marriage.
[time=1622] We have secularized marriage and family and relationships.
[time=1628] And love.
[time=1630] What do I mean by we have secularized it?
[time=1633] What I mean is this, you and we do this.
[time=1636] Everybody in this room, I guarantee you, has done this to one degree or another.
[time=1642] What I mean by we have secularized, we have started to take our cues.
[time=1648] We have actually started to get our direction.
[time=1651] We have actually started to, in essence, take advice from the checkout line at Kroger.
[time=1663] I do it.
[time=1664] Any of you do it?
[time=1665] I pick it up and I thumb through and I look and I'm captivated and I'm curious and I start looking and reading and we take our cues from magazines at stores.
[time=1677] Then I understand from how this works, I'm not that old, I realize you can get that magazine on your iPad.
[time=1683] You can get that magazine delivered to your iPhone every week.
[time=1688] And we just live in that and it forms and shapes our thinking.
[time=1692] We get cues not only from magazines, we get cues from reality families who are living out
[time=1701] their lives right in front of us.
[time=1703] And we get entertained by them and we get kind of curious about them.
[time=1708] And before you know it though, it goes beyond innocent entertainment or curiosity.
[time=1713] We watch so much and we take in so much, we start thinking and we start reasoning.
[time=1719] It's just a crazy thing and it's not just reality TV, it's prime time TV.
[time=1723] And you can turn on any station or any night prime time and get a whole dose of advice.
[time=1731] This whole effort to kind of redefine what's normal and acceptable and we get secularized.
[time=1738] And it's not just magazines and it's not just reality TV and it's not just prime time.
[time=1743] It's also the cubicle.
[time=1745] You take your lives and I take mine and we go and we sit and we just kind of talk with people and all of a sudden popular opinion begins to shape.
[time=1755] We care more about, we take more of our cues from magazines and television and cubicle chatter
[time=1763] than we do this.
[time=1767] Which God gave to you and to me so that we could understand what he wants for marriage
[time=1775] and family, for moms and dads and husbands and wives and kids.
[time=1780] And the secularization of society, this world of ours and especially our Christian world
[time=1790] and its movement more and more and more toward that which is secular away from that which is biblical
[time=1798] has all kinds of effects.
[time=1800] Here's one.
[time=1801] Steve Webster showed this to me this week, a recent study by the Pew Research Group.
[time=1805] The Pew Research Group did a study and within that study they came to the conclusion that
[time=1811] there was actually a new category of people.
[time=1814] You know about millennials and you know about post-moderns and we know about all the different categories based on age group.
[time=1821] Well now there's a new category of people in our country and they're calling them the nuns.
[time=1826] Not N-U-N-N-O-N-E, nuns.
[time=1833] There are 46 to 50 million people in this country of ours today who want listen, who want absolutely,
[time=1842] not only do they want absolutely nothing to do with religion, they don't even think about it.
[time=1848] They don't even talk about it.
[time=1850] They don't even for a moment engage in it.
[time=1853] There isn't anything about it that's interesting to them at all.
[time=1857] They're beyond agnostic, they're not even atheistic.
[time=1860] They don't want to debate, they could care less about spiritual things.
[time=1867] They're not interested, nuns, and in the 50 million guess what the largest segment of
[time=1873] the 50 million, the largest segment over a third between the ages of 18 and 30.
[time=1884] Hey, they got lots of input.
[time=1887] They get all kinds of things to read and watch.
[time=1891] They don't need, they're not interested in, they could care less about this.
[time=1900] So two things on why it's so bad today.
[time=1905] Culture is absolute neglect of God's design and the church is absolute failure.
[time=1909] Oh I mean this too, the church is absolutely, I'm indicting myself, the church is absolute
[time=1915] failure to make God's design for marriage compelling and inviting to the culture.
[time=1921] You say what do you mean?
[time=1924] Well, here's what I mean.
[time=1926] I told you when we started 50% of American marriages in a divorce, the actual number is
[time=1932] 53.1, worldly, culture, society, 53.1, in the church, in the church, 52.8, 52.8.
[time=1951] So they look at you and they look at me and they can just say, so what difference is
[time=1960] your faith making in your lives?
[time=1964] I thought you all had the what?
[time=1969] Apparently you don't and apparently to a large degree we're living and choosing and
[time=1975] acting in marriage as if we don't.
[time=1980] So how to make, how to make God's design for marriage compelling to the culture.
[time=1987] Now we come back to God's word, now we come back to specific direction given to husbands
[time=1993] and wives.
[time=1994] Guys I want to start with you this morning if I can, husbands, God's design for husbands and wives, there's two things I want you to see and I'm going to just put them on the screen right at the beginning, two things I want you to take with you today, love selflessly, husbands love your wives just as Christ loved the church and it really begs the question
[time=2013] of what, say it everybody, how did Christ love the church?
[time=2017] Love selflessly, Ephesians 5, 25, husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church.
[time=2025] Here's the deal, we have for years and years, I think we sort of get hung up on the first part of that phrase.
[time=2032] We get so interested in, rightly so, we get so kind of drawn to this idea of husbands love your wives, husbands love your wives and we want to talk about husbands loving their wives and we write books about loving your wife and we do seminars about loving your wife and all of a sudden because we're so locked in on just this idea of loving your wife, all of a sudden we're buying gifts and we're getting teddy bears and we're doing flowers and we're doing all these things and making beds and none of that's bad.
[time=2060] But we need to read the whole verse, I think, to really provide for you as a husband the
[time=2068] foundation of strength in this effort that could really make a difference because believe me, this isn't just about you loving your wife, this is about you loving your wife the way Christ loved you.
[time=2083] Do you see that?
[time=2085] This is about loving your wife the way Christ loved the world.
[time=2091] How did Christ love the church?
[time=2094] Two things, guys, I hope you'll write these two.
[time=2097] I'm not going to make this complicated.
[time=2098] I want to make this simple.
[time=2100] I'm going to give you two things to think about.
[time=2102] In light of the way Christ loved the church and how you get to move toward your wife.
[time=2108] Here you go.
[time=2109] Number one, write this word down.
[time=2111] Initiative.
[time=2112] Write the word down.
[time=2114] Initiative.
[time=2115] And next to initiative, write down 1 John 4 19 that simply but powerfully says we love because
[time=2123] he, what, say it, first loved us.
[time=2129] In the discussion of Christ's love for us, in this picture of you and Christ and this
[time=2138] union and his love, the question to start with is who stepped toward who first?
[time=2147] You are Christ.
[time=2148] Answer Christ.
[time=2152] Do we ask for the whole Mary and Joseph and virgin birthing?
[time=2157] Did we come up with that?
[time=2158] Who thought of the cross?
[time=2163] Who saw the problem and responded?
[time=2169] Whose initiative was it?
[time=2172] His.
[time=2173] His idea.
[time=2175] His movement.
[time=2177] His choice.
[time=2183] His action.
[time=2186] Initiative.
[time=2188] Guys.
[time=2189] Husbands.
[time=2190] I'm going to give you three things right here.
[time=2192] Relational, spiritual, sexual.
[time=2195] In that order.
[time=2196] Relational, spiritual, physical.
[time=2200] Relational.
[time=2201] This is what relational means.
[time=2203] Ladies bear with us.
[time=2204] We need clarity sometimes.
[time=2206] It means going and doing something with her.
[time=2212] It means with her going and doing something.
[time=2215] You get the drift.
[time=2216] It means asking her to go and run an errand.
[time=2219] It means going to dinner.
[time=2220] It means sitting and talking somewhere.
[time=2223] It just means you just say, hey, would you come and do this with me?
[time=2228] Maybe we could just spend a little bit of time together.
[time=2231] Relational.
[time=2232] I say spiritual, a lot of guys in the room are throats.
[time=2235] Just start to tighten and they're like, I can't execute a passage we're not asking you to.
[time=2240] Nor is she.
[time=2242] We're talking about sitting together at the foot of the bed.
[time=2247] We're talking about sitting out in the living room when it kind of quiets down later and just saying this.
[time=2252] How are you?
[time=2256] Listening to the answer.
[time=2258] Maybe asking one follow-up question and then just saying, maybe we could just pray about that.
[time=2265] Boom, touchdown.
[time=2269] Big smile on her face.
[time=2272] It's like huge.
[time=2274] If you just take a spiritual step forward, could we pray together?
[time=2279] Could I ask you how you're doing?
[time=2281] Maybe you could combine the spiritual and the relational now we're on fire.
[time=2287] And then we're heading toward number three, just kidding.
[time=2292] And number three isn't a joke and we can laugh about it.
[time=2295] But guys, though, you know, I think oftentimes we're pegged as the ones who don't need any help with number three in terms of initiative.
[time=2301] You know what?
[time=2302] Sometimes you do.
[time=2303] Sometimes you need to be reminded in the midst of your busy whatever to take a step, to show initiative.
[time=2313] It's what Christ did.
[time=2316] He first loved us.
[time=2319] And so guys, I'm encouraging you this morning, relationally and spiritually and physically, to make movement, to show initiative, to step forward.
[time=2327] How did Christ love the church guys?
[time=2329] Secondly, he was thick-skinned.
[time=2332] He was thick-skinned.
[time=2334] First Peter 2.23, you'll see it there on the screen.
[time=2337] First Peter 2.23.
[time=2338] And while being reviled, you know what the word reviled means?
[time=2341] The word reviled means insulted.
[time=2344] And ladies, I'm not, listen, I'm not casting you in a bad light.
[time=2349] All right?
[time=2350] I understand how this works.
[time=2351] I know how it goes.
[time=2352] I have enormous respect for all of you.
[time=2355] And I know there are times when against your better judgment and even against your nature, your spiritual nature.
[time=2361] I know there are just times when it gets sideways.
[time=2364] I know you say things you wish you wouldn't have said.
[time=2366] I know you have an attitude you wish you could have gotten rid of.
[time=2368] I know stuff goes down that gets really ugly.
[time=2372] So, I understand.
[time=2374] And you revile him.
[time=2376] You insult him.
[time=2378] And guys, if we're modeling our love for our wise after Christ, please read this.
[time=2383] And while being reviled, he did not revile in return.
[time=2386] While suffering, he uttered no threats.
[time=2389] But kept entrusting himself to her.
[time=2393] No, no, no.
[time=2394] He kept entrusting himself to him.
[time=2397] It isn't about her.
[time=2399] It's about your relationship with him and the strength and the power and the courage he gives you to be the man, the husband he's called you to be to him who judges righteously.
[time=2410] Guys, let me say this to you.
[time=2414] This morning, while being insulted, he did not insult in return.
[time=2418] While hurting, he kept quiet.
[time=2424] Here's the deal.
[time=2425] I've learned this in recent days.
[time=2427] So thankful for those who have taught me this and continued to teach me things like this 25 years.
[time=2435] And I'm still trying to learn and get better at this.
[time=2439] Two things for you.
[time=2440] Guys, you don't have to be offended.
[time=2446] It may be offensive.
[time=2450] But there is a difference between it being offensive and you choosing to be what?
[time=2456] Offended.
[time=2457] You don't have to be offended.
[time=2460] We think we have to be.
[time=2462] You think, are you kidding me?
[time=2464] Did you hear what she said?
[time=2465] Did you see what she did?
[time=2467] And it's not just what she said or what she did.
[time=2469] She keeps doing this and she keeps saying this.
[time=2471] Of course I have to be offended.
[time=2473] No, no.
[time=2474] It may be offensive.
[time=2475] You don't have to be offended.
[time=2481] And certainly, number two, you don't have to get even.
[time=2487] Oh, the failure of men in this room led by your leader on this front.
[time=2496] The idea of getting even.
[time=2498] Somehow, evening the score.
[time=2501] Oh my goodness, how childish, how immature, how selfish, how destructive, how unlike Christ.
[time=2514] You don't have to be offended and you certainly don't have to get even.
[time=2518] He got insulted.
[time=2519] He got mistreated.
[time=2520] He was misunderstood.
[time=2522] And he kept quiet.
[time=2524] He kept moving forward.
[time=2525] He kept walking up that hill to do what God had called him to do.
[time=2529] Do that.
[time=2534] Wives, two things, influence quietly and behave righteously.
[time=2542] Influence quietly and behave righteously.
[time=2547] And I want to kind of hit both real quick in just a couple of minutes from 1 Peter 3.
[time=2553] 1 Peter 3 verses 1 and 2, you're going to see the quiet influence and you're going to see the righteous behavior right here.
[time=2561] It says in 1 Peter 3, 1 and 2, in the same way, you wives be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, every time I read that I laugh,
[time=2572] it's almost like God's sense of humor.
[time=2574] Is there a guy here who hasn't been disobedient?
[time=2577] Please raise your hand.
[time=2579] Okay, so every single woman in the room who's married, this applies to.
[time=2584] It's just kind of funny if you happen to have a husband who's disobedient.
[time=2588] Some think this means not saved.
[time=2592] Some think this means saved but disobedient.
[time=2596] My point is I don't really care.
[time=2598] The purpose of this isn't really affected that much.
[time=2602] We're talking here about how a wife responds.
[time=2606] And it says if you want to win him over, what does it say?
[time=2610] If any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be one without a word by the behavior
[time=2616] of their wives as they observe the disobedient husband observes you, the wife, your chaste
[time=2623] and respectful behavior.
[time=2628] One over, one back, the struggling husband can be drawn toward what's right without a word.
[time=2634] Because I heard a sermon one time called, "How the silent woman sways the sinful man."
[time=2642] Without a word, don't forget ladies' wives.
[time=2648] Oh my goodness, kids, men, any living person.
[time=2653] Here, I'll just remind the wives of it because of, I think, the appropriateness of 1 Peter 3, but everybody, don't forget what it says in Proverbs 10-19.
[time=2662] Where there are many words, where there are a lot of words, transgression, sin, is unavoidable.
[time=2675] But he who restrains his lips is wise.
[time=2679] Wherever there's a lot of words, whenever you just keep talking, whenever you just talk
[time=2685] and talk and talk and talk, and this time around I know I'm going to convince him.
[time=2690] He just needs to hear it from me one more time.
[time=2694] As the volume of, as the amount of words go up, the Bible says, there's just oftentimes
[time=2701] transgression coming.
[time=2703] It's unavoidable.
[time=2706] God's Word says, "Shh, James 1-19, what a great reminder for all of us here for women
[time=2715] and wives, especially in this case." Oh, what's it say?
[time=2719] It says, "Be quick to listen, slow to speak," which leads to being slow to what?
[time=2731] Anger.
[time=2732] Quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to become angry.
[time=2738] God's giving you right there this approach to this that's going to help you.
[time=2744] But that's not even the main point.
[time=2747] You know what?
[time=2748] Like with husbands loving wives, we get caught up in that instead of going further and seeing
[time=2755] as Christ loved the church.
[time=2757] We sometimes get caught up and, "Hey, wives, don't say so much." God's Word says it, but that's just the beginning of the phrase.
[time=2765] It says, "You win him over without a word as he notices and sees your chaste and respectful
[time=2772] behavior." Here, my friends, is righteous behavior.
[time=2778] Chaste and respectful is what it says in the NASB.
[time=2782] And I want to just tell you what that's talking about is pure and honoring.
[time=2787] Pure and honoring.
[time=2791] Wives, you have a chance to influence your husband, your disobedient husband toward that, which
[time=2797] is good and right and true by purity.
[time=2800] How you dress, how you talk, how you're entertained, how you conduct yourself with the opposite
[time=2809] sex, even the purity of your devotion to the Lord.
[time=2814] This chaste and pure character, it really matters.
[time=2819] And God's Word says it has an effect on him, a little h, your husband.
[time=2825] And honoring, chaste and respectful, pure and honoring.
[time=2829] What do we mean by honoring?
[time=2830] Ladies, listen, it's about how you, it's about how you speak to him, yes.
[time=2835] It's about how you act toward him, yes.
[time=2838] It's even about how you talk about him with your friends.
[time=2841] It's how you make him look in the kitchen, in the living room, in the home.
[time=2848] God's Word says you're chaste and respectful behavior.
[time=2852] Your quiet influence and your righteous behavior has the capacity and the strength to influence him, towards all that God has called him to.
[time=2861] And I pray, my prayer this week has been that in the midst of a culture that wants to draw you as husbands and wives in the opposite direction that we would listen and that we would act.
[time=2874] Love her first, guys, initiative, thick skinned, quiet influence, righteous behavior.
[time=2885] Let's just stand as a church.
[time=2888] Let's sing this morning.
[time=2890] And as we sing this morning, allow the truth of what we sing about.
[time=2894] Allow the truth of what's on the screen in light of the truth we have heard this morning allow it to encourage and influence you as husbands and wives.
[time=2903] Let's worship our God, let's lift our voices together.

[time=3442] Hey, Connie, throw that first slide of that song back up on the screen.
[time=3445] I just was thinking about this.
[time=3448] Lied in my darkness, peace for my soul.
[time=3451] You are my rescue.
[time=3453] You never let go.
[time=3456] Remember, I'm a big fan of marriage.
[time=3459] Tim Keller said, most painful, most what?
[time=3462] Most wonderful.
[time=3464] It's a gift.
[time=3465] I'm not a negative guy.
[time=3467] Like I did a wedding yesterday right here.
[time=3469] You know, and there's times I wanted to say to him, I want to say, quit looking at him that way.
[time=3475] Don't look at her that way.
[time=3477] It's not going to be.
[time=3479] Sometimes I think we get this confused.
[time=3481] We look at each other and say, like my darkness.
[time=3486] Sometimes we look at each other and we say, "Hey, you're peace for my soul." And I want to just remind you, he or she isn't.
[time=3494] It's why we want to make disciples here.
[time=3498] Because when you're devoted and thoroughly, absolutely surrendered to him, it makes a great husband.
[time=3504] It makes a great wife.
[time=3506] Because he is filling you at every level.
[time=3508] And that's what our hope is.
[time=3511] And if you're getting a second chance, how thankful we are for that, I hope you'll do it right.
[time=3517] I hope you'll let us help.
[time=3518] I hope you'll be encouraged, not discouraged.
