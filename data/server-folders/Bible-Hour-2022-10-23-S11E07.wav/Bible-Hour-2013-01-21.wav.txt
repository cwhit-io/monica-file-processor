[time=211] [MUSIC - 125 seconds]
[time=341] - Good morning, welcome to Blackhawk.
[time=346] And I'd like to welcome you into our modern family series.
[time=351] And I'm excited to continue that series today.
[time=353] I hope it's been challenging.
[time=355] I hope you've learned some things.
[time=356] I hope you've incorporated some of that stuff.
[time=359] I know I am very thankful for the message last week that KB gave about being married and how I need to try to attain to the standard of my awesome life.
[time=374] And I'm still trying to do that.
[time=376] I will do my best.
[time=380] I'm also, I'm a dad.
[time=381] And so that's kinda where this message comes from.
[time=384] Comes from out of being a dad.
[time=387] I am privileged and honored to raise my beautiful girls.
[time=390] I have two beautiful girls.
[time=391] I love them, I love them a lot.
[time=395] And my perspective is a little different because they're 11 and nine and I know what's coming.
[time=401] You laugh.
[time=406] I don't think it's funny.
[time=410] I know what's coming because I've heard other parents but I've also know what's coming because for so many years, 15-ish, I worked with teen years exclusively and I've worked through issues and tragedies and pain and sorrow and relational stuff, dating stuff.
[time=427] And a lot of it, a lot of the issues were between them and their parents, them and mom and dad.
[time=433] And I'm not excited for my kids to get there.
[time=438] They still think they kinda look at me as a superhero.
[time=441] But that's slowly fading.
[time=444] And when it does, I hope I have parented well and that they will still wanna be my little girls in that sense.
[time=453] So, like I said, Amy and I have walked with many students through many kinds of issues and all kinds of stuff.
[time=460] And some of these think, oh, well then you're probably ready.
[time=463] You probably, you probably just handle the teenagers.
[time=465] Nope, because it's so different when they're your kids.
[time=469] They're so different.
[time=471] See, when they'd come to youth stuff or we'd come and we'd sit down and talk and then they'd leave and I didn't worry.
[time=477] I mean, I did my job, I'd pray for them, but as far as the job of raising them, not my job, right?
[time=483] I didn't have to worry about that.
[time=484] They go home and that's your job.
[time=487] It's rough, it's hard.
[time=488] Parenting is the hardest job and it's the most, it has the most at stake and it can bring the most joy and also the most heartache.
[time=496] And I'm so thankful, KB, the first week told us that we have the Holy Spirit to fill us, and lead us and guide us, to give us courage and wisdom and strength to raise our kids and to raise them well.
[time=512] See, the title in your outline says, "Teenology" and it's a little misleading.
[time=516] Teenology is, it's more about us as parents than it is about the kids.
[time=522] So I figured, if I'm gonna help parents, if I'm gonna love students enough, then I know enough to know that you gotta help the parents.
[time=531] You gotta teach them, you gotta help them understand their kids.
[time=535] You gotta encourage them along the way and all the research and all the books that I've been reading.
[time=541] All the stuff has been collected, this group, this age group has studied and prodded and phone interviewed and all this data has been coming together and they've kind of have some theories and some ideas and some conclusions about why certain kids' faith lasts and certain kids doesn't, right?
[time=559] Train up a child on the way she goes so when he's old, he won't turn from it, sticky faith, but they'll keep walking with Jesus all the way through their life.
[time=567] But all the data suggests everything that I've read that is concluded without every one of the research things has indicated there's one single indicator that ranks the highest for that student or that kid or your child's faith to last and that one single indicator, that one single factor is mom and dad's faith.
[time=591] Your faith, my faith.
[time=594] Mom and dad's faith is the single greatest influence in the kid's life.
[time=602] And God will provide and God will be there for you and he's gonna help you as a Holy Spirit, but your faith is number one.
[time=608] You are the single greatest influence on your kid's life.
[time=613] All the research says we're losing that battle, especially in our churches in America.
[time=622] According to Rainer Research, 70% of the youth leave the church by the time they are 22 years old.
[time=628] There's a movie that my girls and my wife,
[time=635] we sat down and watched about a week ago, it's called The Lorax.
[time=639] It's a good movie, cute.
[time=641] It's a good story, Dr. Seuss.
[time=643] Dr. Seuss is always a good time.
[time=644] And it just kind of tells the story about this guy who starts a business, chops down all the trees, all the trees are gone.
[time=651] Kind of destroys the land.
[time=655] He's kind of locked away in this little place and there's this kid who's maybe gonna change that, bring the trees back.
[time=662] And then the Lorax guy kind of left this stone and on the stone it says unless.
[time=667] And the quote goes something like this, unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better, it's not.
[time=675] Mom and dads, we have to care an awful lot.
[time=680] If we're going to change the trajectory of our kids and whether they stay with their faith or not, we have to care an awful lot.
[time=686] The church has to care an awful lot.
[time=688] I think that's a cool movie, you should check it out.
[time=692] How have you ever been to a beach?
[time=695] Just Indiana Beach does not count.
[time=697] (audience laughing) If you've been to the beach, you've probably walked up to the beach and you may be seeing the lifeguard station or somewhere along the beaches, flags in the ground, the red flags, right?
[time=710] Hopefully you know, if you don't know, I'm gonna tell you, they're warning flags.
[time=715] And if they're red, it means don't go on the water, don't swim because the undertow is dangerous, it will pull you out and you'll drown and die.
[time=724] It's a very happy, happy flag, right?
[time=727] So, yeah, in our world today, there is a very strong undertow that our culture is pulling and pulling our kids away from the things of God and towards the things of darkness and the evil one.
[time=743] Let me be the first, if you don't know, to raise the flag this morning and it's red.
[time=747] And there is a strong influential undertow that our culture is pulling our kids out to see that is no good where they will drown and die.
[time=760] So we must, moms and dads, it is our job.
[time=764] We must anchor in and start pulling them back.
[time=767] We must jump in and courageously lead and love our kids with everything we have, like their lives depend on it because it does.
[time=776] Unless someone like me and someone like you who cares an awful lot, it's not going to get better.
[time=786] It's not.
[time=788] Unless you train up a child in the way they should go when they are old, they will turn from it.
[time=796] So my message is to parents of any age, teenagers, little ones, maybe it's not even here yet.
[time=805] Maybe someday you want kids, maybe you don't even like kids.
[time=807] My message is still for you, right?
[time=810] We have to rise up, we have to stand strong.
[time=813] Parents, we have been called by God, the God who hung the moon and scattered the stars, that God has called us to train up a child in the way he should go so that when he is old, he will not turn from it.
[time=826] How?
[time=827] How do we do this?
[time=828] By grasping, by hooking onto these five anchors that I'm going to talk to you about this morning, these five anchors, by establishing these five anchors, will help us parent our kids so that when they are old, they will not turn from it.
[time=842] If you have an outline, I encourage you to take it out.
[time=845] See, webby was webby, I got it baby, right there.
[time=848] All right, sweet, take out your outline.
[time=852] We're going to go one to five, it's going to be good.
[time=855] Okay, anchor number one, anchor number one, write this down, plan, plan.
[time=863] God's plan is your plan, he has this plan to do what I'm going to say, called the Shema.
[time=867] God knew what culture could do to his children, he knew the influences he understood.
[time=872] So he gave them this passage, he gave them this text.
[time=875] The plan is simple, it's a generation of adults who love God with everything that they have.
[time=879] And they demonstrate that love by merely living it out in plain view of the younger generation.
[time=886] Knowing this, this is God's plan, his way.
[time=888] Deuteronomy six, let me read it to you.
[time=891] Here, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[time=894] You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.
[time=899] And these words I command you today shall be on your heart, you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, when you lie down, when you rise, you shall bind them as a sign in your hand, you shall be, they shall be as frontlets between your eyes, you shall write them on the doorpost of your house and on your gates.
[time=919] Shema, the word means to listen or to hear.
[time=922] In Orthodox Jewish homes, this would be recited in the morning and maybe in the evening, and it would be used for celebrations and rituals.
[time=931] This was a huge passage in their homes.
[time=934] This is quite possibly the very first passage or verses that Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior knew.
[time=941] If Jesus had a Bible, it'd have been in red.
[time=945] You like that, I know you like that.
[time=947] Okay, dumb passage joke, sorry.
[time=949] Let's break this down.
[time=951] I gave you three words in your outline.
[time=952] The first one was foundation, second one is model, third one is intentional.
[time=955] First one, foundation.
[time=957] Our foundation is God, right?
[time=960] Love the Lord, oh, sorry.
[time=962] Pure Israel, the Lord, our God, the Lord is one.
[time=965] That is the foundation.
[time=966] We have God.
[time=967] God is our beginning point and our end point.
[time=969] He is our foundation.
[time=970] He influences everything we think, say to, act, smell, eat, everything God.
[time=975] Everything is begins with, it starts with, it is our foundation, is what the house is built on.
[time=981] It is our foundation.
[time=983] He is our starting point.
[time=985] It can't be pop culture.
[time=987] It can't be psychology stuff.
[time=988] It can't be science.
[time=989] It can't be anything other than God.
[time=992] He is our foundation.
[time=993] Here, oh, Israel, the Lord, our God, the Lord is one, the only one.
[time=998] And he will not stand for any rivals where there be false deities or material idols.
[time=1003] He alone, the creator God, all knowing God, all powerful God, all loving God.
[time=1007] He is our foundation.
[time=1009] He is the God who wrote the story of scriptures orchestrated the greatest love story ever told.
[time=1014] It is the God we worship and lift high with praise.
[time=1017] Our beginning point, the lens by which we view everything on the planet, our lives, even our own being and our own thoughts is God.
[time=1026] This week, I heard a great question by a very intelligent young lady.
[time=1031] The question was this, who made God?
[time=1033] No one made God.
[time=1039] He just was.
[time=1040] He's the foundation.
[time=1042] He was before all things.
[time=1045] God just was.
[time=1046] He always has been.
[time=1048] He is our foundation.
[time=1052] That's the first word.
[time=1052] Let me give you the second word there.
[time=1054] Model, model, a love for God.
[time=1062] See, we have, it says this, "You shall love the Lord, "your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, "and with all your might." And these words that I command you should be on your heart.
[time=1072] Love him with everything you have.
[time=1074] See, when we do this, parents, when we love God with all that we have, when we love God, we are in this unique position in the family.
[time=1082] When we love God with all that we are and all that we have, our kids are watching us.
[time=1087] Our kids see that.
[time=1090] This isn't a lecture.
[time=1091] This isn't a lesson.
[time=1092] This isn't a Bible study.
[time=1093] This isn't something you drive to.
[time=1095] This is your life.
[time=1098] This is your love for God just living out in the home and in the rhythm of life.
[time=1104] And your kids get to watch that.
[time=1106] Every day, every week, every month, of every year that they are in your home.
[time=1114] They're gonna see you.
[time=1115] They're gonna see your love for God.
[time=1117] That is our privilege.
[time=1118] That is what we get to do.
[time=1119] This is just a model.
[time=1121] This isn't something that's taught.
[time=1122] It's something that's caught, right?
[time=1124] This is just something that's good.
[time=1125] They're gonna watch you.
[time=1126] They're gonna see it.
[time=1127] They're gonna watch it in your life.
[time=1129] See, that's God's plan.
[time=1132] He has this plan.
[time=1133] He gives them this chapter.
[time=1134] This is, it's to pass it on, to pass on this faith.
[time=1137] Pass on, I love for God.
[time=1138] Let them see it.
[time=1140] They watch us all the time.
[time=1143] It's the third word there.
[time=1145] It is intentional.
[time=1148] We need to be intentional about passing on, faith in God.
[time=1152] This is where the passage gets intentional.
[time=1155] You shall teach them.
[time=1157] You shall talk to them.
[time=1159] You shall bind and press them on them.
[time=1162] You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and your gate.
[time=1165] This is the intentional part.
[time=1166] This is the part where you get to sit with them.
[time=1169] You get to read the Bible with them at bedtime.
[time=1172] One of my favorite times.
[time=1174] Amy gets to read to them.
[time=1175] Sometimes I'll sit there.
[time=1176] We'll get to pray.
[time=1177] I'll give them all the, I'll give them their jump kisses.
[time=1180] Don't worry about it.
[time=1181] Just something with you.
[time=1182] And it's just this great time.
[time=1183] Amy's done such a good job with just helping them read.
[time=1186] And then dad gets to answer the questions.
[time=1189] It's just really fun.
[time=1190] One of the greatest ways we do this is tell them about our journey, parents, moms and dad.
[time=1196] What is our experience with faith?
[time=1197] Do they know your testimony?
[time=1200] Do they know how you came to know Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?
[time=1203] When we're driving in the car, often I will say girls, you see that church right there when we're driving by.
[time=1208] And so you see that church?
[time=1210] It used to be Calvary Temple, it's now First Assembly.
[time=1213] Beautiful church.
[time=1215] So that's the church.
[time=1216] That's where daddy first heard about Jesus Christ.
[time=1219] That's where daddy's life was changed.
[time=1221] The true directory of daddy's life was changed and it so was yours.
[time=1226] My eternity was changed and therefore now yours is as well because of that place right there.
[time=1231] That's where daddy first heard of Jesus Christ.
[time=1235] Right there.
[time=1236] And I tell him that.
[time=1236] Like our dad we know, right, tell him, right?
[time=1241] See this, we get to read with them.
[time=1243] We get to discuss it with them.
[time=1244] We get to ask them questions.
[time=1245] So what do you think God looks like?
[time=1247] Little kids ask them, it's a great question.
[time=1249] What do you think God looks like?
[time=1250] A monkey.
[time=1251] They got a big monkey, right?
[time=1254] Who knows, let them talk.
[time=1255] Tell them stories about God in your life.
[time=1257] And when they hit adolescence, keep doing it.
[time=1260] Now it might need to change a little, right?
[time=1264] It might be alter a little bit.
[time=1266] If you get them around the table, they're going to have a fair amount of devotions.
[time=1269] They might think, right, they might get that whole roll the eyes thing going at that lesson time, right?
[time=1275] But here, let me give you, if that's not working, which it's okay, it's kind of normal, okay?
[time=1281] If that's not working, do this.
[time=1282] Take one of their friends.
[time=1284] There's something happens in one of the lives of their friends, they get in trouble, they get in big trouble or something.
[time=1288] Say, ask them this question.
[time=1290] Say, what do you think about what happened to Ted or what Ted did?
[time=1293] Just ask them.
[time=1294] Here's the trick.
[time=1295] Okay, you ready?
[time=1296] And then shut their mouth and let them talk, right?
[time=1301] You like that, right?
[time=1304] Teenagers, you know, right?
[time=1307] Just let them talk and don't resist the temptation to turn it into a lecture, right?
[time=1314] Just let them talk and as they're talking, no matter how crazy or wrong or off those thoughts are, don't freak out.
[time=1324] As soon as you start to go, as soon as you do that, they're done, they're not gonna talk anymore.
[time=1330] Because they're like, oh, what I'm saying is freaking out, I'm done, right?
[time=1334] Right?
[time=1335] You guys know what I'm talking about, right?
[time=1336] Just ask the question, shut their mouth, don't freak out.
[time=1340] Let them talk, I didn't get it out.
[time=1343] Let them see, let them experience that.
[time=1345] It's so good and just don't lecture, okay?
[time=1350] Don't lecture, unless we, unless I, unless you and I, train up a child on the way, they should go, when they're old, they will turn from it.
[time=1357] If you need help with this faith conversation, especially in the younger years, Faith Conversations for Families by Jim Burns, great book, write that down.
[time=1366] Faith Conversations for Families by Jim Burns, that might help you.
[time=1369] Okay, let me just put a big bow on this whole anchor number one plan, the key to this, okay?
[time=1375] If you're going to try to have set God as your foundation, if you're going to try to model a love for God, if you're going to intentionally pass on faith, key right here in your outline there, write this down, authenticity.
[time=1389] This passage is dripping with authenticity.
[time=1393] If it's not real in your life, it will not be real in their life.
[time=1398] They will smell a fake, they will see right through you.
[time=1404] They will think, oh, you're just using God to get me to do what you want, and they will rebel, and they will resist, and they will just walk away.
[time=1412] If it's not real in your life, don't you dare use God to parent your kid, because they will reject him, and that's not fair to God.
[time=1420] Amen?
[time=1425] Okay.
[time=1426] See, it has to be authentic.
[time=1428] It has to be real.
[time=1430] And you might get away with being fake when they're young, but when they hit this age, they're going to see right through you.
[time=1439] See, if you don't see God as your foundation, they won't.
[time=1442] If you don't sincerely love God, they won't.
[time=1444] If you try to teach them the word about God, but don't live it in your own, they will follow your lead.
[time=1450] If you love God on Sundays and not Monday through Saturday, they will do the same thing.
[time=1456] And that's not why Jesus died.
[time=1458] Homs and dads, you are the number one influence on your kids.
[time=1464] Train up a child in the way they should go, and when they are old, they will not turn from it.
[time=1468] Let's go to number two.
[time=1471] Number two, anchor number two, as we hook on, as we get into these anchors, number two is rest.
[time=1478] Number two is rest.
[time=1481] We have a very busy culture.
[time=1483] This is not news to you.
[time=1484] It's very busy.
[time=1485] We typically, sometimes our days wake up, work out if you haven't quit on your resolution, right?
[time=1491] Work out, eat something quick, or just skip it all together.
[time=1494] Off to work, go to the office, work all day, pick up the kids, take them to practice, drive to their game, get home, clean dishes, take out the trash, fix your broken door, pay the bills, do the taxes, pay 'em, right?
[time=1504] Oh yeah, I should probably love my spouse if I give her a hug, if I talk to my spouse somewhere in there, right?
[time=1509] Yeah, whatever, so hurry, hurry to bed, and then you really, you're just jumping bed so you can quickly fall asleep and get five salad hours of sleep, right?
[time=1517] We are just so busy in life.
[time=1520] There's pressure, it's fast, it's hurry, it's quick, it's go, go, go.
[time=1524] And what starts out as temporary, right?
[time=1528] The son or daughter's in swimming, or wrestling, or basketball, or cheerleader, or whatever might be right in it, band might get busy for a season, all of a sudden it just turns into all the time.
[time=1538] And we are dominated by our schedules.
[time=1541] We are dictated by the tyranny of the now.
[time=1544] Philosopher once said, "Hurry is not of the devil, it is the devil." Richard Foster, popular devotional author wrote, "Our adversary majors in three things, "noise, hurry, and crowds.
[time=1557] "If he can keep us engaged in muchness and manyness, "he will rest satisfied." Parents, we cannot train up a child in the way they should go if we are empty, if we do not value, if we do not anchor into the importance of rest in the routine of our lives.
[time=1574] Every year, there's this little thing called, fall blast, AO, right?
[time=1581] And we go to this little place.
[time=1584] And one of the things I used to do was we'd take an hour in the mornings, a Saturday morning, they'd have it a long time with God.
[time=1591] And then one of the sessions, we'd have these breakout sessions, one of the whole sessions was just designed and geared for them to rest, right?
[time=1598] We just knew their schedules are just as busy, if not busy or sometimes, right?
[time=1603] So we just wanted to offer them an opportunity just to sit, and rest, and meditate, and just be with God.
[time=1609] And hands down, kids would come back and say, "That was their favorite part of the whole weekend." Not dodgeball, not flag football, not the food, not the awesome youth pastor.
[time=1619] Jesse, they just said, "That was the favorite part of their weekend." Yeah, whatever.
[time=1625] Okay.
[time=1626] And I think there's something hardwired into us that just needs rest, right?
[time=1631] We know there's things that are just about us that is because of God, right?
[time=1635] When God, God is relational, how do we know this?
[time=1637] Father, Son, Holy Spirit, they're kicking it in this perfect relationship, right?
[time=1642] And when God said, "I made you in our likeness, in our image," God has made us with His DNA sort of in us.
[time=1648] We are relational people because we have a relational God, right?
[time=1652] Okay, and so there's things about us, and in Exodus 20 at the end, this is this, "For in the six days, the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day.
[time=1662] Therefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy." God had kind of already established this rhythm of our souls that we need rest.
[time=1671] We are relational because God is relational, and we need this rest because God has made it holy.
[time=1676] It's a time to realize that He is the one who makes us holy.
[time=1682] See, when we reflect, and when we understand that our whole life is sustained by the hand of God, that this weekly pattern of work and rest is to be regular and essential part of life.
[time=1693] When we do that, God will fill us up.
[time=1696] The word "sabbath" literally means to exhale.
[time=1699] God exhaled, but it's bigger than just taking a nap
[time=1709] or getting some downtime.
[time=1711] It's being still and knowing that He is God.
[time=1714] Do we regularly get time to rest?
[time=1717] And I don't mean sleep.
[time=1718] I mean, time to look up in awe of God.
[time=1722] Time to look back at all He has done for us and provided, and time to look forward in the hope that we have in Jesus Christ.
[time=1730] There's this rest feel when we just sit with God, and we just think about Him, when we be still and know that I am God, that He is God.
[time=1739] It just means, be still and know Him, God means to let go of your gripe.
[time=1743] Right, so often we think we have to do these things so that God will love us more.
[time=1749] Sometimes He just wants us all the time, He wants us just to sit with Him and rest at His feet.
[time=1755] And the arms of our Savior.
[time=1757] See, Jesus died on the cross, so you wouldn't have to do anything to gain His love.
[time=1761] So you wouldn't have to feel obligated.
[time=1763] So you wouldn't have to do certain things, so you feel more spiritual or more loved by God.
[time=1770] Jesus died on the cross, so we could have rest in Him.
[time=1775] Jesus says,
[time=1785] "And you will find rest for your souls.
[time=1787] From a yoke is easy and my burden is light." Parents are ever a time that it's important to rest in God.
[time=1796] It's when your parenting skills get challenged, especially in adolescence, but all the way through.
[time=1801] If we try to parent out of emptiness, we're just cutting it short.
[time=1806] We're holding back, we're damaging our children.
[time=1811] We need to parent out of fullness because we've rested in the arms of our Savior.
[time=1817] When we rest, we can say, often we can say, "I can't do this, but He can." When we rest, I'm not a perfect parent, but He is.
[time=1825] When we rest and trust in Him, I have, I don't have what it takes, but He does.
[time=1831] It's just a time to sit with God and rest in Him.
[time=1837] Train each out on the way, she should go.
[time=1840] When he is old, he will not turn from it.
[time=1842] Parents, let's parent out of fullness.
[time=1844] Figure out a way in your schedule and the rhythm of your day.
[time=1848] If you're not doing it at all, take a minute.
[time=1850] Take five, whatever that might look like.
[time=1853] Just sit with God.
[time=1856] Don't do anything.
[time=1857] Just sit and think of Him as goodness and as grace.
[time=1862] And fill yourself up on God so you can parent your kids.
[time=1866] Anchor number three, keep moving here.
[time=1869] The way is restore, and this is where the gospel infiltrates.
[time=1872] This is where it all kind of comes together as far as how we discipline and how we correct our children.
[time=1879] Let me just kind of do this real quick.
[time=1881] See, God, throughout the story of the scriptures, God kind of has this story.
[time=1887] I like to think of the Bible as this story, and it's all the same story, the same God, the same author all the way through.
[time=1894] And in the beginning, God created some kids, making Him the first parent, and He loved them.
[time=1903] And He gave them the keys to paradise and they crashed it.
[time=1908] They wrecked it.
[time=1916] So the next time your son or daughter does something, you know, bad, right?
[time=1921] Just remember that they didn't alter eternity or human history for all of eternity.
[time=1927] Remember that, just keep that perspective, keep that in the back of your mind.
[time=1931] See, and when they wreck this paradise, God responds with discipline, yes, there should be, but He doesn't wipe them out.
[time=1940] He doesn't eradicate.
[time=1942] He doesn't completely destroy.
[time=1945] In fact, He goes the other way.
[time=1946] He slays an animal and He covers them.
[time=1948] He provides.
[time=1950] And all throughout the Old Testament and into the new, we see God, this pattern of, there's His kids, these relights, they disobey, there's punishment, but He doesn't go all the way.
[time=1963] There's always this remnant, there's always something held back, there's always somebody left.
[time=1969] God doesn't completely destroy.
[time=1971] Diego Carson wrote a book, and then one of his chapters is called The God Who Doesn't Wipe Out Rebels.
[time=1977] There's something there that this God doesn't completely just eradicate.
[time=1982] And there's this overarching plan that God has throughout the Scriptures, I think runs all the way through.
[time=1987] I will be your God and you will be my people.
[time=1991] See, God wants children for Himself.
[time=1993] He wants a people.
[time=1995] He wants His kingdom.
[time=1996] He wants us to live in a relationship with Him to have intimacy and love.
[time=2000] But when the kids crash paradise, it all goes sideways.
[time=2002] But, but, see, then the first parent,
[time=2008] God does something.
[time=2009] He comes down on our side defeats sin by standing in our place and standing up once for all against sin and pays the price of defeats death by dying on a cross.
[time=2020] He comes down on our side and he defeats sin and death.
[time=2027] See, when, here it comes.
[time=2030] Moms and dads, we stand against sin and disobedience.
[time=2035] Never and not ever against our kids.
[time=2040] We, Jesus stands against sin and disobedience with us.
[time=2046] We stand with our kids right next to them fighting against sin and disobedience, just like in our own lives.
[time=2055] See, we don't stand against our kids.
[time=2060] Even in the worst rebellion or the worst broken trust or the worst acts of defiance or disrespect or whatever is happening in that kid's life, we, they need to know that we love them and we're standing with them against sin just like Jesus did for us.
[time=2078] Never against them.
[time=2080] Jesus stood without even though we were yet sinners, even though we were dirty, even though we were ugly, even though we were disobedient and disrespectful and that we loved to do sin, he died for us.
[time=2093] See, this thing, he wants these kids right here and us.
[time=2102] He wants them, he wants to destroy them.
[time=2107] He wants them to buy into lies.
[time=2108] And here's how that plays out.
[time=2110] A guy or a gal likes another guy or the gal, right?
[time=2115] They start texting, right?
[time=2117] And then it gets too much, too much texting.
[time=2120] That strains the mother and father's relationship with the kid.
[time=2123] All of a sudden, there's some arguments about, oh, you do this, you do too much, take a blah, blah.
[time=2127] And then it kind of continues and it grows and it grows and it grows and it's intense.
[time=2131] And then all of a sudden, the kid is lying and defying and hiding because they just don't want to get in trouble.
[time=2137] All because they bought a lie.
[time=2139] See, we want to stand against the lie, the sin, not the kid.
[time=2144] We're with them.
[time=2145] We want to show them what has happened.
[time=2148] We want to look behind the issue.
[time=2150] See, when parents and students would come into my office and we'd, kids would tell me what they've done.
[time=2154] I've never yelled at a student ever.
[time=2156] Not my job does no good to yell at them.
[time=2159] There's something happening in the soul.
[time=2161] There's sin in the heart.
[time=2163] Let's talk about that.
[time=2165] And let's figure out how to restore that.
[time=2168] See, when we fly off the handle, we back handle, we just yell and we consequence and consequence and nothing gets restored, right?
[time=2177] We just keep pushing them away, away, away.
[time=2179] Because it feels like, and it's kind of, we're standing against them and not against the sin in them.
[time=2187] We want to stand with our kids against sin, not against our kids.
[time=2194] Does that make sense?
[time=2196] I sure hope so.
[time=2200] See, Mom and Dad, we're called to restore, not just throw punishment at it.
[time=2207] If the goal of discipline is not just behavior modification through pain, fear, and intimidation, we want to restore that.
[time=2217] We want to help that along.
[time=2220] And let me give you, in that anchor and under anchor number three, there's four blanks there.
[time=2225] I think they'll flash up on screen.
[time=2226] It goes discipline stage, training stage, coaching stage friendship stage.
[time=2232] These are, I stole these from Andy Stanley, who stole them from somebody else.
[time=2235] If you can't remember who stole them from who just say they're mine, OK, deal.
[time=2239] And throw me money, OK?
[time=2241] But this is just a guideline, right?
[time=2244] Just like these anchors, these anchors aren't magic bullets if you do these great parenting, but it's a great foundation.
[time=2249] But ages one to five, right?
[time=2250] It's the stage where if they touch the stove, they're going to touch it, no, right?
[time=2256] You don't want them to touch the stove.
[time=2257] You don't want them to put your finger in a light socket, or you're helping them all the way through, friendship stage.
[time=2262] That's that point in time, parents, when your kids all of a sudden, at night, they start coming in to you, but they sit in your bed and they just start talking to you.
[time=2272] And you're kind of like, what's going on?
[time=2274] That's good.
[time=2276] That's a good indicator that what you've done in the past has been working.
[time=2283] That's good.
[time=2284] When they just come in, they just want to know what you're thinking.
[time=2286] And they just want to talk, and they're like, I got to go to bed.
[time=2288] I got to work in the morning, but you're like, just let them don't say that, just let them know.
[time=2292] They're doing that, that's so good.
[time=2294] And so, if you get to that coaching stage, coaching stage, right?
[time=2297] For one to five, and even up into the next stage, like you are micromanaging your kids, for the most part, when they're little.
[time=2304] You get them up, you feed them, you wipe their butts, right?
[time=2306] You got to do all that stuff, right?
[time=2308] As they get older, right?
[time=2309] Every stage, it's like, okay, I don't have to do that.
[time=2312] They don't need a high chair, they don't need a car seat, like they can open the door themselves, they can clothe themselves, that's good.
[time=2319] We want our kids to be independent, responsible adults who love Jesus.
[time=2324] We don't want them in our basements at 26.
[time=2328] Mom, give me breakfast.
[time=2330] No, you want them to leave.
[time=2332] You want to parent them in such a way so they will leave you, but not hate you.
[time=2339] Not reject you, right?
[time=2342] So there's things happening there.
[time=2346] I've noticed this, and the friendship stage, right in there is right about the time they're heading off to college.
[time=2355] Don't send them to college with a curfew.
[time=2358] That's not gonna work.
[time=2363] I mean, there's so many thousands of kids running around crazy, and you got one who's supposed to stay until nine.
[time=2370] Nah, I don't think so.
[time=2372] Not gonna work.
[time=2372] They're just trying to say, oh yeah, I'm home.
[time=2375] That's not gonna work, trust them, right?
[time=2378] Let them learn on their own a little bit.
[time=2380] Anyway, when the relationship is not stored, when punishment without relation occurs, that equals rebellion, defiance, hiding, sneaking, lying, because they just like me, you don't want to get in trouble.
[time=2392] So we need to sit with them.
[time=2394] We need to help them understand that that's the sin.
[time=2396] This is what we're after.
[time=2397] I'm not against you, I'm for you, I'm with you, I'm 100% behind you.
[time=2401] Two other things under that anchor is don't argue.
[time=2405] Don't need to yell, don't need to argue with your kids, you're the adult.
[time=2409] Yelling honors no one, you're the adult.
[time=2413] And the second thing, and this is really important, pick your battles.
[time=2417] Not everything requires a 30-minute lecture, or for them to be grounded, or for them to lose their phone, or internet time, right?
[time=2427] Choose your battles wisely, and be ready to die on that hill if you choose that hill.
[time=2433] 'Cause if they win, now you've got a teenager whose confidence they can defeat you.
[time=2439] You've got an underdog coming in with confidence.
[time=2443] We've seen that in the tournament all the time, they go down.
[time=2445] So if you're gonna pick that battle, you better win.
[time=2448] Trade a child in the way she'd go when he was old, he will not turn from it by standing against sin and not our kids.
[time=2454] Okay, striving to restore and not destroy.
[time=2459] Good.
[time=2461] Anchor number four, perseverance.
[time=2464] Perseverance.
[time=2468] Therefore since we were surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses led us also lay aside every weight and sin which cling so closely and let us run with endurance, the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame and has acceded the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=2488] This is one of my all-time favorite passages because it reminds me never to give up, keep going just like Jesus did.
[time=2495] Jesus didn't quit, even when they pulled out a cross.
[time=2498] He kept going.
[time=2500] In Tennessee, I took some of these kids right here, of you all, teenagers shout out, right?
[time=2506] And we went to this place called Tennessee and I chose this hill that was straight up and they haven't told the story before, if I have apologized, but they were straight up and their packs were too heavy 'cause they brought too many stupid things they didn't need and it was just awesome.
[time=2519] And every so often I would just yell, "Nobody quits!" I was in the back because we didn't lose anybody, right?
[time=2525] Or, and usually the bears attacked from the front, didn't tell you that.
[time=2528] And I'd say, "Nobody quits!" And they'd yell back, "No, nobody quits!" And usually it was all of them and after a while, I was assuming a few of them, but they didn't quit, they kept going.
[time=2538] Parents, we cannot quit.
[time=2539] It's going to be hard, it's gonna be difficult and when you feel hopeless, you feel lost, when your words can't describe their confusion, the frustration, the agony of why is that kid doing these things persevere?
[time=2553] Nobody quits.
[time=2554] It's gonna feel heavy at times.
[time=2557] It's gonna feel like you've lost all hope.
[time=2559] Fix your eyes on Jesus, trust him.
[time=2562] Train up a child in the way he should go.
[time=2565] And when he was old, he will not turn from it.
[time=2567] As the band comes up, I'm gonna summarize if you think, anchor yourselves to the plan, the plan got outlined to do on Army 6.
[time=2575] Anchor yourselves to the importance of rest.
[time=2578] Find a way to rest.
[time=2579] Find a way to refresh your souls.
[time=2581] Anchor yourselves to learn, to restore your kids to discipline just like Jesus did.
[time=2585] Don't stand against them, stand with them.
[time=2588] They've gotta know your forum.
[time=2590] Anchor in and persevere, don't ever quit.
[time=2594] As you think about these four stages, as I think about this message and as I think about how parenting kinda moves through stages and as the years go on, as the kids grow older and they change and develop, there's a book I've brought and it's kinda the stage of the parenting but it's also how God loves us.
[time=2615] And I'm just gonna read it.
[time=2617] And so just sit back, you can put your pencils down.
[time=2620] Anchor number five is love.
[time=2622] I just don't want you to be type A's.
[time=2624] I don't want you to start shaking.
[time=2626] Oh, it's called "Love You Forever."
[time=2635] My mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[time=2641] And while she held him, she sang "I'll love you forever.
[time=2643] "I'll like you for always.
[time=2645] "As long as I'm living, my baby, your being." And the baby grew, he grew and he grew and he grew and he grew until he was two years old.
[time=2653] He ran all around the house.
[time=2654] He pulled all the books off the shelves.
[time=2656] He pulled all the food out of the refrigerator and he took his mother's watch and flushed it down the toilet.
[time=2660] Sometimes his mother would say, "This kid is driving me crazy." But at nighttime, when that two-year-old was quiet, she opened the door to his room, crawled across the floor, looked up over the side of his bed.
[time=2672] And if he was really asleep, she'd pick him up and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[time=2679] While she rocked him, she sang, "I'll love you forever.
[time=2682] "I'll like you for always.
[time=2683] "As long as I'm living, my baby, your being." That little boy grew.
[time=2690] That little boy grew, he grew, he grew and he grew.
[time=2693] He grew until he was nine years old and he never wanted to come in for dinner.
[time=2696] He never wanted to take a bath and he went, "Grandma, visit it." He always said bad words.
[time=2701] Sometimes his mother wanted to sell him to the zoo.
[time=2705] But at nighttime, when he was asleep, the mother quietly opened the door to his room, crawled across the floor and looked up over the side of the bed.
[time=2714] If he was really asleep, she'd pick up that nine-year-old boy and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[time=2721] While she rocked him, she sang, "I'll love you forever.
[time=2724] "I'll like you for always.
[time=2725] "As long as I'm living, my baby, your being." That boy grew, he grew and he grew and he grew.
[time=2731] He grew until he was a teenager.
[time=2733] He had strange friends and he worked strange clothes and he listened to strange music.
[time=2738] Sometimes the mother felt like she was in a zoo.
[time=2741] But at nighttime, when that teenager was asleep and the mother opened the door of his room, crawled across the floor and looked up over the side of the bed.
[time=2750] If he was really asleep, she'd pick up that great big boy and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[time=2757] While she rocked him, she sang, "I'll love you forever.
[time=2760] "I'll like you for always.
[time=2762] "As long as I'm living, my baby, your being." A teenager grew, he grew and he grew and he grew.
[time=2768] He grew until he was a grown-up man.
[time=2771] He left home and got a house across town.
[time=2773] Well, that mother, she got older.
[time=2776] She got older, older and older.
[time=2779] One day, she called up her son and said, "You'd better come see me because I'm very old and sick." So her son came to her.
[time=2785] When he came in the door, she tried to sing the song.
[time=2788] She sang, "I'll love you forever.
[time=2791] "I'll like you for always." But she couldn't finish because she was too old and too sick.
[time=2797] The son went to his mother, picked her up, rocked her back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[time=2803] And he sang this song, "I'll love you forever.
[time=2806] "I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, "my mom and you'll be." When the son came home that night, stood for a long time at the top of the stairs.
[time=2817] Then he went into the room where his very, very new baby daughter was sleeping.
[time=2823] He picked her up in his arms, very slowly rocked her back and forth, back and forth.
[time=2830] All he rocked her, he sang, "I'll love you forever.
[time=2835] "I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, "my baby you'll be." [AMEN] (gentle music)
[time=2865] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 357 seconds]
[time=3238] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 163 seconds]
[time=3408] One more time, all my life.
[time=3410] [MUSIC - 73 seconds]
[time=3513] (upbeat music)
[time=3543] You
