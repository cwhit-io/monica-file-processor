[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - Well, hello again, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] It's great to have you with us, and as you can tell this morning, I'm not alone.
[time=38] I'm thankful to have my good friend, Clinton Foppel, from Remedy Live with us today.
[time=43] I've known Clinton for a number of years.
[time=45] We've been fortunate enough to be able to just have not only his input, but his friendship, as we've continued down this road of ministry at Black Hawk.
[time=54] And some of you know Clinton and Remedy Live really well.
[time=59] Others of you, maybe it's the first time you've ever seen this guy's face on the screen.
[time=64] A lot of us who have been on this journey with Remedy know that a number of years ago it was Remedy FM.
[time=71] It was an online radio type deal.
[time=73] I'm gonna let you just briefly tell folks what it was.
[time=77] - Yeah. - 'Cause I didn't do it justice right now. - No, no, you did great.
[time=80] I want you to tell them what it was, and then catch folks up on show.
[time=84] God has kind of transitioned Remedy to the place that it is today as Remedy Live.
[time=88] First of all, I think it just goes without saying that if you're a parent of a teenager, you know teens evolve with media.
[time=95] And because media always changes, we have made a commitment that we're gonna change with it.
[time=99] And so what started out as an internet radio project has now evolved into using video, we call it internet television.
[time=106] And then the core of what we've always been about, which is that conversation, that chat, text message conversation with students to make sure that when they're in the midst of a struggle in the midst of even something that's fabulous, that they're able to have someone unpack that with.
[time=121] And so the backbone of Remedy Live right now is not only just the video and the music, but it's a team of volunteers called The Soul Medic that are online in their homes, on their computers, chatting with students that come to us, and we're able to kind of create this online missionary role that really has just been unbelievable with the kinds of things we've been able to see God do through it. - Wow, wow.
[time=142] You'll hear more about The Soul Medic opportunity in today's broadcast.
[time=148] I hope you'll just stay tuned.
[time=149] It's gonna be a fantastic opportunity.
[time=152] Where can they find you?
[time=153] Still at? - Sure.
[time=155] - Well, for this audience, I might ask you to go to a different website, but RemedyLive.com is where we do our ministry.
[time=161] It's a little loud.
[time=162] You know, it's targeting that 13 to 25 year old range.
[time=166] But for you, I'd ask you to go to soulmedicmedia.com.
[time=169] That's where you're gonna find out more statements of faith.
[time=171] You're gonna find out philosophy.
[time=173] You're gonna hear a little bit about our history.
[time=174] Plus, you'll be able to see some of our training videos and why we do what we do.
[time=178] And maybe you're interested in being a soul medic.
[time=180] And you wanna see what is this like?
[time=182] We'll be able to see all that there at soulmedicmedia.com.
[time=185] - Yeah, and I believe with all my heart, which is why, one of the reasons why Clinton's here today, I believe with all my heart there, those of you out in our viewing audience who are equipped and ready and prepared to do that very thing, to be a soul medic, to be somebody who would be available, to interact with, encourage, pray with, inspire, and speak into the life of a young person today in need of help.
[time=209] So I hope you'll take them up on that soul media.
[time=212] - Soulmedicmedia, soulmedicmedia.com.
[time=216] It'll be here on the bottom of the screen.
[time=218] And thank you so much for being here today.
[time=220] - Thank you, thank Blackhawk, for all that you've done for us and exposure and getting disconnected with students in your community.
[time=228] We were so grateful.
[time=229] - Absolutely.
[time=230] - Well, hey, we're thankful you tuned in.
[time=231] God bless you.
[time=232] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=234] [MUSIC - 29 seconds]
[time=287] (audience applauds) - We're gonna teach you a new song this morning
[time=297] called Endless Light.
[time=298] (upbeat music)
[time=306] [MUSIC - 244 seconds]
[time=553] (upbeat music)
[time=569] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=631] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 145 seconds]
[time=795] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 134 seconds]
[time=938] All right, on and on and on and on.
[time=942] [MUSIC - 156 seconds]
[time=1103] - Hey, man, you can have a seat.
[time=1129] Well, what a gift already this morning to hear the room just filling up with voices filled with gratitude
[time=1138] and thankfulness for the privilege that we have once again to be here together as a family.
[time=1142] And we have spent hours and hours.
[time=1146] The team has worked tirelessly to prepare for you this morning an entire morning really geared around a response to the last four weeks of our series on modern families.
[time=1158] All right, here we go.
[time=1159] Hey, everybody.
[time=1159] I want you to just look at the screens here in just a moment.
[time=1163] I think the beginning of our time together this morning as we consider a collective and personal response
[time=1173] to what we've heard over these last few weeks.
[time=1175] I want to read this to you.
[time=1176] I want it to be kind of the foundation of our discussion and our teaching this morning.
[time=1181] So very important that we understand the great power and the effectiveness of confession.
[time=1187] And I want you just to look at the screens.
[time=1190] James, chapter five, verse 16 in the new living translation.
[time=1194] James 516 says this.
[time=1197] It says confess your sins to each other.
[time=1202] I want you to stop right there and look at me.
[time=1204] It means that.
[time=1208] God's design for the body of Christ is that we would be a family,
[time=1215] that we would be a people so devoted to him, so committed to each other and so set on this course of following him in authenticity and honesty that we would be a people willing to have no pretense, no facades.
[time=1230] And in the honesty and the transparency of our lives, confess our sins to each other.
[time=1239] And there are appropriate ways to do that.
[time=1242] There are appropriate settings within which to practice that.
[time=1245] But make no mistake, God's design for us as a family is that we would experience that kind of relationship.
[time=1252] Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.
[time=1258] The earnest heart felt from way down deep.
[time=1261] The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power.
[time=1267] And I want you to read these last three words with me out loud.
[time=1271] Everybody and produces wonderful results.
[time=1276] Wonderful.
[time=1278] You hear confess sin openly.
[time=1282] You and I, we hear confess our sins to each other.
[time=1286] And we think embarrassment and shame and guilt.
[time=1290] Oh, let me run out of here quickly.
[time=1292] And the word of God says that it brings about wonderful results.
[time=1301] When the body of Christ is willing to function in that very manner.
[time=1305] So keep that in mind.
[time=1308] Five weeks ago, we began a journey here at Blackhawk Ministries, a journey to explore once again the wisdom, the insights and principles of God's ancient words on the issue of families, modern families, and their real life everyday struggles matched up against God's divine design.
[time=1326] God's original plan for moms and dads, husbands and wives, families, and homes.
[time=1331] We hope it's been helpful.
[time=1334] I know from your feedback, it's been thought provoking and convicting,
[time=1340] even encouraging.
[time=1341] I got this note just last week.
[time=1344] This series has, this series, this single young man shot me a note.
[time=1349] This series has altered my life and changed my entire view of marriage and family.
[time=1354] I'm not married and have no kids yet.
[time=1357] But one day, if that's what God allows, I'm confident that now I'll be ready to honor him and his design.
[time=1364] I got this letter after week one.
[time=1367] Thank you for reminding us, Kelly, on Sunday, that we'll never make any progress as a family, as a couple, and in our home without the pursuit of and the filling of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1377] As a father, he goes on to say, as a husband and leader of my family, I am too often filled with lust, anger.
[time=1389] Excuses and laziness.
[time=1391] And as I listened to you unpack the flow and context of Ephesians 5 yesterday,
[time=1399] I realized my great need for a new and fresh filling.
[time=1402] I will ask for that filling, be open to that filling in the days to come,
[time=1408] and can't wait for these next four weeks.
[time=1411] Let us have it.
[time=1412] You know this man, that guy who wrote that clearly did what I invited
[time=1418] each and every one of you to do on that first Sunday in January.
[time=1423] Do you remember what I asked you to do?
[time=1425] I asked each and every one of you four weeks ago to be honest.
[time=1430] I asked you to be honest with yourself, to be truthful,
[time=1436] to allow the Word of God and the Spirit of God to create in you a courageous Spirit to face what was there.
[time=1446] To listen to God's design and let me just briefly remind you of a couple
[time=1452] of major things that the Lord allowed us to hit on.
[time=1456] I encourage you to listen to God's design husbands.
[time=1459] Let me start with you guys just real quick.
[time=1462] Please listen.
[time=1464] I encourage you to be honest, husbands, and think about the way in which you love
[time=1470] your wife, God's Word, called you in Ephesians 5 to love your wife, like Christ loved the church.
[time=1475] Guys, what do we see there?
[time=1476] As we looked at how Christ loved the church, we saw that he did it with pursuit and planning.
[time=1482] That's right, Christ planned to come toward you.
[time=1486] Remember our two points?
[time=1489] We encouraged you just like Jesus did with you.
[time=1491] We encouraged you as husbands to move toward your wives with initiative and with thick skin, with initiative and with thick skin, initiative, a willingness to step in to conflict, to step into crisis, to step into question marks and situations
[time=1512] where nobody seems to know what to do or what to say.
[time=1515] Guys, a willingness to show initiative and step in and not back to go first to lead the way.
[time=1521] We love him.
[time=1523] First John 4 taught us a couple of weeks ago.
[time=1526] We love him.
[time=1527] See, remember in the Bible, he's the groom.
[time=1529] We're the bride.
[time=1530] So the love of the woman, if you will, not trying to be funny, it's as we, the bride, love him, the groom, the man, because he first, what?
[time=1543] Love does.
[time=1544] And guys, that's the model.
[time=1547] We love first.
[time=1550] We go first, initiative, initiative, initiative and thick skin,
[time=1558] a readiness to not be offended, to overlook what really can be overlooked,
[time=1564] to not be petty, to not get even, to not keep the upper hand,
[time=1570] to love our wives the way Christ loved us with initiative and a readiness
[time=1577] and a willingness to endure.
[time=1579] Wives, we encourage you to listen to God's design.
[time=1582] To listen to God's design has stated for you in first Peter chapter three,
[time=1588] where the scriptures mandate you to influence your husband, even in his disobedience to influence him quietly while behaving righteously.
[time=1597] What did that mean?
[time=1598] Wives, it means to care more about him having the Holy Spirit's encouraging whispers, means to care more about him hearing the Holy Spirit's encouraging whispers rather than your frustrated, fearful words of warnings, judgments and criticisms again
[time=1614] and again and again.
[time=1616] It says there in the text that you can win him without a word.
[time=1619] I loved what William Barkley said.
[time=1621] I read it this week.
[time=1622] William Barkley said this without a word has nothing to do with the muzzling of a woman.
[time=1629] It's not at all the intent.
[time=1630] It's not at all what God is saying.
[time=1631] It's not about the muzzling of a woman.
[time=1634] It's not about a mandate to some kind of silent treatment.
[time=1637] It has instead specifically to do with the temptation.
[time=1641] And it is a temptation wise because it leads you to sin.
[time=1645] It has to do Barkley says with the temptation to repeatedly tell a disobedient husband what he should do.
[time=1653] See what he's talking about here really is the amount of words,
[time=1660] not the accuracy because every honest guy in the room would look you in the eye this morning
[time=1669] wife and say most of the time, you're what?
[time=1673] You're right.
[time=1676] Most of the time, you're right.
[time=1677] It's not about veracity.
[time=1679] It's not about being accurate.
[time=1682] You're usually very accurate.
[time=1684] What the word of God is trying to help you with here is the amount of times you say it.
[time=1689] I love what I found this week.
[time=1692] Wanted to share it with you this morning regarding winning him over without a word, this willingness to kind of step back on the verbal front ladies.
[time=1700] It's saying no, here's what it means.
[time=1702] It's saying no to those subtle and manipulative forms of verbal persuasion,
[time=1708] which may produce the human response of compliance, but fail miserably to produce the supernatural response of repentance.
[time=1720] And I hope you'll just take that in, wives, because believe me, what you want from him
[time=1727] is you want to see God do supernatural repentance in him because that'll carry you
[time=1734] for years and years and years.
[time=1736] What you don't want is just simply compliance because he's tired of hearing you talk.
[time=1741] Supernatural repentance.
[time=1745] God promises this.
[time=1748] God will bring this.
[time=1749] We encourage you with real honesty to listen to God's designed for parents
[time=1756] and secure the five anchors from Jesse's powerful message last Sunday.
[time=1762] If you were here last Sunday, raise your hand.
[time=1765] Oh my goodness, you can put him down.
[time=1767] If you weren't here last Sunday and you haven't listened to it yet, haven't watched it, go to the website today, download it, keep it, don't let it go.
[time=1774] Always hold on to Jesse's message from last Sunday.
[time=1778] You're here last Sunday.
[time=1780] I'm down at Assembly Hall at IU watching IU in Michigan State.
[time=1784] Didn't feel guilty about it at all.
[time=1785] I was having a great time, had planned on it, but I knew you were in good hands.
[time=1790] And I'm telling you at 1025 and at 1215, my phone blew up with texts and emails and tweets
[time=1800] from people just blown away and grateful for what they heard last Sunday.
[time=1804] Do not miss that message.
[time=1805] Go back and get it if you missed it.
[time=1807] In that message, you'll find that we gave you God's design for parenting adolescents.
[time=1814] God's design calls for you as parents to plan to have a plan for your investment.
[time=1822] We'll come back to that.
[time=1823] God's design calls for you as parents to rest.
[time=1826] Oh, please remember this church, a spiritually, physically empty tank makes for a parental breakdown.
[time=1833] An empty tank makes for a parental breakdown.
[time=1838] It won't go well.
[time=1840] It won't come out like it should.
[time=1841] It won't accomplish God's purposes.
[time=1844] So thankful for what Jesse had to say about rest.
[time=1847] Restore.
[time=1848] God's plan calls for you to restore their hearts to get to the root of what is going on.
[time=1856] I am so guilty of this.
[time=1859] I have failed my kids for years and our home and our family on this front.
[time=1866] I'm trying and I believe God's helping me make progress but I think maybe many of you,
[time=1872] I just tend to gravitate toward the external and what is irritating me and what is disappointing
[time=1879] me or what is angering me and I see the behavior and I see what it produces and that frustrates me
[time=1885] and so I move in with great parental precision and I want to squish the behavior which brings
[time=1893] about compliance back to the quote.
[time=1896] You can get compliance, right?
[time=1899] Too many times that's all you get when what you should be and what I should be after as
[time=1905] a parent is repentance and the only way you get repentance is when you get to their heart.
[time=1913] And that takes asking questions and that takes being calm and that takes having a conversation
[time=1922] that's not angry but inquiring and gentle.
[time=1929] And oh God help us, each and every one of us.
[time=1933] Any of us in the room that sit at the end of a bed with a kid help us to be a people who are more about restoration and finding the root causes of things.
[time=1945] Then just compliance, God's design, Jesse told you last week calls for you as parents to persevere, to persevere, to never, ever, ever, ever, ever quit.
[time=1956] To always be willing no matter what, no matter how many times, no matter the level of disappointment
[time=1962] or confusion, to never, ever, ever communicate in any way, shape or form to them that there
[time=1968] could be a day when you might just pull back.
[time=1974] Certainly there are consequences I understand that to certain things but all that we would be a people who persevere and fifthly, that fifth anchor loved them, all loved them.
[time=1985] They don't question your love for them, do they?
[time=1990] These are the anchors of God's design.
[time=1991] I want to go back to plan, I love what Jesse said, I got to interact with him even more about it this week, got new the best way, got new the only way to effectively pass along and model a dynamic faith was to have a plan.
[time=2004] Deuteronomy 6, I want to take you there just one more time.
[time=2007] It says in Deuteronomy 6, 6, such a powerful, powerful passage as Moses intercedes and begins
[time=2016] to communicate to the people of Israel on God's behalf.
[time=2020] These words, he says in verse 6, "These words which I am commanding you today shall be these words from God, these words of God, God's design, if you will, shall be on your heart.
[time=2033] You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your
[time=2042] house, diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when
[time=2048] you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up."
[time=2055] It says, it goes on in verse 8, "You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, they shall be as frontals hanging down from your forehead, you shall write them on the doorpost, post of your house and on your gates, God's design.
[time=2069] My friends, for families in the investment of truth from parent to child is that their
[time=2075] world as a child under your care should be inundated, surrounded with and consumed by
[time=2083] the Word of God.
[time=2085] It should be everywhere they go.
[time=2087] It should be natural, yes, it should be relational absolutely, but there should be this readiness
[time=2094] in you to communicate and to talk about when they rise up, when they go to bed.
[time=2098] It says, when you sit down, we have on the stage this morning some tables, we're going to come back to this a little bit later.
[time=2105] But it's interesting, tables as in dining room, tables, tables as in kitchen tables.
[time=2111] Interesting to read what many of the marriage and family experts are saying these days in terms of settings within which Christian families and parents get to communicate, they
[time=2121] would say we have in our culture today all but lost the kitchen table, that it is just
[time=2128] absolutely almost thoroughly gone as far as the choices that could be made to utilize
[time=2135] it and leverage it as a place of communication and prayer and conversation and questions
[time=2141] and reading and listening and so we'll come back to that.
[time=2146] Lots of parents, my friend Clinton who you're going to meet here in just a moment told me last week, lots of parents today can set out to find China and make the table look good but sadly too many parents today don't know how to feed their kids.
[time=2161] Too many of us just don't know how to feed our kids, the very food they desperately need.
[time=2170] James 5, James 516 my friends with all of that in view and with all your notes from the
[time=2179] last four weeks and the encouragement that we've tried to give you over these weeks we want to give you a chance this morning to respond.
[time=2188] James 516 says I'm going to read it to you again as Clinton makes his way up here and says confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.
[time=2199] The earnest prayer of a righteous man has great power and everybody together produces wonderful results.
[time=2207] Wonderful results when the body of Christ and the family of God are willing and ready to come and confess and I'm grateful for Clinton Foppel.
[time=2216] He gives leadership and runs point on a ministry here in town used to be called Remedy FM.
[time=2221] Now it's Remedy Live.
[time=2223] They are on the cutting edge, they are out there in front helping the kingdom here in this community and the church and I know our church understand better ways to do ministry
[time=2233] in the lives of young people who desperately need it and he's been willing to help us utilize
[time=2239] some technology this morning that I think is going to help us in our very endeavor right here this morning as we pursue James 516 Clinton tell them a little bit about Remedy and then talk to them about what we're about to head into.
[time=2251] Sure.
[time=2252] Morning church.
[time=2253] You know I love Blackhawk I was thinking about Remedy in our studios about three years ago I was talking to a young lady who walked through that door back there one Sunday morning.
[time=2265] She was involved in the occult and in fact she called herself a witch and she got dragged here at a Blackhawk one morning by somebody and she was in trouble she had a child she
[time=2277] couldn't feed the child she had very little money and she came you know kicking and screaming but she said that morning in a honest confession God if you're real help me I don't have any
[time=2291] food I don't have any way of caring for my child will you help me and that morning the
[time=2297] power of the Holy Spirit I can't remember who was talking she didn't mention that but something happened that morning where the Holy Spirit created a moment for her to for
[time=2307] the first time understand Jesus Christ and gave her life to him and he provided because
[time=2315] the prayer of a righteous person does powerful things and I'm so grateful to be here this
[time=2321] morning because I represent a technologically based organization now technology is not good
[time=2328] or bad but oftentimes in our society it is used for bad.
[time=2333] People met the peak of its power would build these massive roads to carry these these armies
[time=2340] to conquer and destroy villages they would just literally go and wipe out these people
[time=2347] huge roads that would be built and years later the missionaries would use these same roads
[time=2355] to bring the gospel of reconciliation and hope the gospel that changes families the gospel
[time=2362] that redeems and takes the brokenness and turns that into a place of being able to step up and say I want to I want to serve Jesus I want to live for Christ and I've seen technology do awful things I've seen nine-year-old boys lose their innocence to sexualized images on screens I've watched text messaging as Kelly mentioned destroy families that face to face
[time=2384] communication is lost and now the only secrets piling up but there's bitterness being harbored
[time=2390] and communications just not being done I've seen technology do some really bad things but this morning what I wanted to bring and Kelly and I've been talking and praying about this series is I wanted to bring what remedy really cares about the most and that's transparent confession and I want to tell you about the way that we're going to do that this morning if you have a cell phone I know you've hauled it out already once but hauled out again and
[time=2414] what I want to do is I want to give you a chance to participate in what God is doing now I believe a crazy thing this morning it's not so crazy but it might sound crazy I believe
[time=2425] the Holy Spirit is sovereign amen amen the Holy Spirit the third person of the Godhead
[time=2434] is active already this morning the first service we had 50 people with their cell phones dumped confessions into our text to chat system and it's not just a text message what's happening
[time=2446] is that that text message is being sent to our systems and then it's being connected to one of our very live human normal with a story background soul medics people that
[time=2456] are just here to chat listen and love and 50 individuals that first service were beginning to unpack the confessions through the modern family series and just in life in general addiction brokenness abuse hard hard things that maybe face to face difficult to talk
[time=2474] about but over this device where it's all anonymous it's just a number on a screen we
[time=2480] are not going to come to your house we're just allowing the Holy Spirit to begin a conversation
[time=2486] of cleansing but then throughout the morning Kelly is going to give us some great guidance and direction as to how we can take this transparent Holy Spirit flag in the sand no turning back
[time=2499] I have been changed to change people decision that we would walk away this morning different
[time=2505] because of the confessions we submit to God so I want to pray for you I want to ask the Holy Spirit to move mightily this morning and so will you join me in prayer Lord I'm
[time=2520] looking out at this crowd with my eyes open I see families I see I see singles I see young
[time=2529] adults I see teens Lord God in your plan your master plan is that a husband and wife the
[time=2537] marriage would be the basic building block of our society when the marriage collapses
[time=2543] society breaks down but then in that marriage you do something great you say be fruitful
[time=2549] and multiply and we begin to have children and the family is created but when the family
[time=2555] breaks down because of non-communication unforgiveness brokenness addiction hopelessness
[time=2562] again our society breaks down our society is only as great as the family's Lord and so I pray by the
[time=2568] power of your Holy Spirit in this next few moments you'd reconcile marriages that are broken you'd
[time=2575] reconcile a father to us his son Lord God a a daughter who is self-injuring to her mother
[time=2583] who doesn't understand that Holy Spirit moved mightily during this time that we would have a
[time=2589] transparent moment of confession that you would do some mighty work I pray in Jesus' name Amen
[time=2596] Hey I'm gonna have him turn the lights down just a little bit and I want to read to you if I could
[time=2603] as we head into this time of response Psalm 32 let me read this to you Psalm 32 verse 5
[time=2612] Psalm 32 5 it says this says I acknowledged my sin to you and that's what I want to invite you
[time=2621] to do this morning for so many of you in the room this is a difficult step even the beginning to just acknowledge the fact that your choices and your patterns that your decisions have taken you away
[time=2635] from God's design God's word and God's truth God's will in whatever way you have started to or have
[time=2646] continued to function outside of that on whatever front and the word of God maybe even over these
[time=2653] last four weeks and this morning most certainly calls you to acknowledge to acknowledge your sin
[time=2660] Psalmist says I acknowledged my sin to you God and my iniquity I did not hide I said I will
[time=2669] confess my transgressions to the Lord and you forgave the guilt of my sin
[time=2681] wonder how many of you in the room would just honestly I mean we're just family right I wonder
[time=2687] how many of you in the room would just honestly raise a hand and say I've experienced the guilt of my sin anybody the guilt of my sin you know and I know that that can be overwhelming you and I
[time=2701] both know that can be discouraging you and I both know it can lead us at times to places of
[time=2707] hopelessness and despair and hear the psalmist hear the word of God gives us great hope and you
[time=2714] forgave the guilt of my sin the psalm goes on to say therefore let everyone who is godly
[time=2722] let everyone who is wanting to honor God pray to you in a time when you may be found
[time=2732] at time for you my friends church this morning that time when he can be found for you is is now
[time=2739] is right now here in this moment surely in a flood of great waters they will not reach and do not
[time=2746] presume upon the grace of God don't bank on another time don't begin to manipulate your thoughts
[time=2754] terms of maybe dealing with it later you are my hiding place
[time=2762] you preserve me from trouble you surround me with songs of deliverance how grateful are we for
[time=2770] verse seven because so many times you and I both think once we jump in on this it's going to be anything but a hiding place it's going to be anything but songs of deliverance we think it's
[time=2783] going to be harsh and embarrassing and humiliating and awful and lonely and
[time=2789] psalmist reminds us you god are my hiding place as confession takes place you preserve me from
[time=2798] trouble you surround me with songs of deliverance if you work your way back it won't be on the
[time=2807] screen but if you just work your way back to the beginning of the chapter oh the the picture that is painted and i want to paint it for you this morning how blessed not how humiliated
[time=2818] not how shamed how blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered how blessed is
[time=2828] the man to whom the lord does not impute iniquity and in whose spirit there is no deceit
[time=2841] i hope you remember this to confess is today usually understood to mean admission of guilt usually today people think of confession as okay you got me busted however the literal
[time=2853] meaning of confession is to acknowledge something whether good or bad the usage of the term confess and the bible involves two things both admission of being a sinner to god admitting that to god
[time=2864] that what you've done what you've thought where you've gone you're admitting to god what what he
[time=2871] thinks about it is true you're admitting it to god and then look acknowledging in the next breath
[time=2878] one's faith and future obedience to god i hope you catch that confession is i've sinned
[time=2888] confession is i have violated you god and i will now turn and move in a different direction what's
[time=2897] it say acknowledging one's faith and future obedience this is confession it's not just i messed up
[time=2904] it's god i violated you and now i am going to run i am going to leap i am going to scratch
[time=2911] and claw my way if i have to to a different direction i will pitch whatever needs to be
[time=2919] pitched i'll toss whatever needs to be tossed i'll talk to whoever i might need to talk to i will stop at nothing god because i don't want to violate you i want to live in peace with you
[time=2931] and so i admit my sin and i acknowledge my faith and obedience to you confession is
[time=2938] i'm sorry and i'm out of here i am gone from this place of transgression
[time=2945] and so this morning is an opportunity for each and every one of you i mean that
[time=2953] a chance to acknowledge husbands husbands a chance for you to acknowledge your sin
[time=2961] your lack of initiative your weak quiet silent pulling back a chance for you to confess
[time=2969] that you don't have thick skin that you are too ready and willing to fight it's an opportunity for admission wives admit it confess that your behavior isn't
[time=2985] chased and respectful as it says there in the scriptures that at times you say too much
[time=2991] that at times the holy spirit's whisper in his little h your husband's ears sometimes gets drowned
[time=2999] out by your ongoing words own up acknowledge admit own up families moms and dads parents homes
[time=3008] confess an approach to daily life that sees you making money paying bills getting things done and
[time=3016] quite possibly losing your kids in the midst of it all an approach to family that truth be told
[time=3023] sees you involved at a minimal level on the spiritual investment front the internet twitter
[time=3031] facebook hallway conversations at school culture in general quite possibly is making a larger more
[time=3037] consistent investment into the lives of your family than you are it's all upside down
[time=3045] and not what god designed and this morning we simply want to give you the opportunity in light
[time=3051] of all you've heard to take a step to take a meaningful personal step in the right direction
