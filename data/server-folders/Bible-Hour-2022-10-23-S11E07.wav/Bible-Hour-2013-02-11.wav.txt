[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again and welcome you guys.
[time=34] We're thankful for the chance to spend a few minutes with you today.
[time=36] I'm joined by my good friend Jim Bradley.
[time=40] Some of you know Jim, others of you may not.
[time=42] But Jim and Linda and Damon have been a part of the Black Hawk family, Jim for how long would you say?
[time=48] - Over 20 years.
[time=51] Jim has made enormous contributions to this family and this ministry over the years.
[time=57] Most of you may know Jim through his business.
[time=61] Century 21 Bradley has been kind of a fixture in Fort Wayne.
[time=65] When did that start for you Jim?
[time=67] - 1977.
[time=70] - Yeah, it'll be 39 years here.
[time=72] - 39 years here.
[time=73] What was the first house you ever sold?
[time=75] - Actually on my first house was 1973.
[time=78] - Wow.
[time=78] - $18,050.
[time=80] (laughing) - We'd be at $50 more to get the deal.
[time=83] - Oh that's fantastic.
[time=85] - How about that?
[time=85] - Oh that's great.
[time=86] - I was 39 years ago.
[time=87] And the reason Jim's here today is that most of you know that what began in the '70s at 18,050 bucks, God has kind of parlayed into a real estate kingdom and opportunity that Jim leads with a number of talented people that God has blessed over the years.
[time=106] And Century 21 Bradley has become a fixture and not just a fixture financially.
[time=113] Not just real estate wise.
[time=115] Not just in terms of monetary success.
[time=118] But for those of us who know Jim, we know that Jim has for years and years seen that business as a ministry opportunity and a chance to make much of God.
[time=129] And recently you've heard me talk about here on the air.
[time=132] Jim has decided to partner with Rod and Carolyn Ovett and Blackhawk in this Lagos Institute of Biblical Studies, this grassroots movement to put the word of God and doctrine and life-changing scripture into the hands of everyday people.
[time=148] Rod and Carolyn do that so well through Lagos and Jim has decided to allow Lagos to come into his new campus, his new facility there up on DuPont.
[time=159] And we're gonna have a new North campus for Lagos and Century 21 Bradley's gonna be hosting it.
[time=166] And so it kind of begs the question, you got so many things cooking, you're not bored.
[time=172] You've got so many commitments and priorities.
[time=175] Why was it so important to you to have Rod and Carolyn come and why are you welcoming them and all the folks who are gonna come to these Lagos campuses onto your site there at DuPont?
[time=186] - Well, it's easy.
[time=187] I mean, God's blessed my business, my family and we've got this new technical media center that's kind of a television studio just like I'm in now.
[time=195] Obviously we've had the TV show for 17 years, so.
[time=198] - Yeah.
[time=200] - We had this vision to create a media center and it's dynamic and it's in a great location.
[time=204] And so you asked me if we could use it and I'm like, absolutely yes.
[time=206] I mean, I tell some of the other day, business is not first, it's like third, okay?
[time=211] It's like God, my spiritualized first, they're my family and then business.
[time=215] So I walked through my media center many times in my whole facility and went, Lord help me use this for your kingdom.
[time=221] So then you come along.
[time=222] - Wow.
[time=223] - How about that?
[time=224] - Oh, that's fantastic.
[time=224] I mean, the answer was yes, immediately.
[time=227] I mean, are you kidding?
[time=228] - Wow.
[time=229] So you really do do that.
[time=230] You really have walked through, and I don't know if you all have seen the new facility out there at DuPont.
[time=235] Used to be down here at Georgetown now out there on DuPont, kind of next to behind the trolley bar out there.
[time=241] It's a tremendous facility.
[time=243] You actually walk through it and pray.
[time=246] - Yep.
[time=247] - God, help me use this business and this facility for your kingdom.
[time=252] - Absolutely, you know, years ago I sold a preacher and a small guy came from New York and he's like, Jim, don't ever sell your business.
[time=259] And I'm like, okay.
[time=259] And he goes, Jim, your business is your ministry.
[time=261] And I've always thought that, but he verbalized it.
[time=264] So, you know, my wife inspired me, obviously.
[time=267] She's my prayer warrior and my daughter.
[time=268] And so, yeah.
[time=270] I mean, it was immediately when you ask, are you kidding?
[time=273] This is, yes, to team up with you guys.
[time=276] And I think you have other meetings at Brookside and Decatur.
[time=280] - Yeah, yeah.
[time=280] Yeah.
[time=281] All around the region.
[time=282] - So there's like now four meetings on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[time=284] - Absolutely.
[time=285] - Yeah, we're trying to fill up the week.
[time=287] And, you know, it's amazing the day that they had that terrible tragedy with the kids got shot into elementary school.
[time=295] - New town.
[time=296] - Sandy Hooker, what, new town?
[time=297] - Yeah.
[time=299] - I was in a room and I was in a meeting.
[time=301] I came out, it was like 15 people in my meeting room all watching the television.
[time=304] We have three or four televisions in there and big screens and I'm like, what's going on?
[time=309] And within five minutes, one of my agents grabbed everybody and he said, we're gonna do a circle of prayer right now.
[time=315] And that was so cool because we went and got everybody in the building.
[time=319] Well, not everybody showed up, but everybody did.
[time=321] We had this big circle of prayer.
[time=323] That was the most instrument.
[time=325] That was so cool.
[time=326] That wasn't very long ago.
[time=326] It wasn't cool.
[time=327] What happened?
[time=328] - Yeah.
[time=329] - It was just awesome that the Holy Spirit helped one of my agents put everybody in a circle in the meeting room and prayed.
[time=334] - That's great.
[time=335] - Yeah, that's great.
[time=336] - I've prayed in that room alone many times, many times.
[time=339] - Well, we wanted you to know about it again, the details for the startup of the classes are right here on the bottom of the screen.
[time=348] Dates and location, the Lagos website.
[time=351] You can go to that.
[time=352] There's a number that you can reach Rod and Carolinette.
[time=355] We'd love for all of you in this region, everybody in our broadcast audience, to be a part of Lagos at the new campus, the new North Campus location at Century 21 Bradley.
[time=366] I'm deeply grateful for Jim and his generosity and the 21 team out there as they open up that facility.
[time=373] God's gonna do great things and we can't wait for you to be a part of it.
[time=377] Jim, thanks.
[time=378] - Give us one more thing.
[time=379] - Please do.
[time=380] This, I've been motivated here for two reasons.
[time=383] One, I just tell her about, hey, yeah, do your best and gattle to the rest.
[time=386] But the most important thing I've been telling me recently is something that I think Rick Warren, but he said, you know, the Bible's not designed to inform us, not just to inform us.
[time=396] It's designed to transform us.
[time=398] - So I'm really excited about hearing that Rod, his team, transform us more.
[time=401] - Transformed lives, right there at Century 21 Bradley, weeknights, we can't wait.
[time=407] God bless you, thanks for tuning in.
[time=409] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=411] - How many of you got a Jesus storybook Bible in recent days here?
[time=417] Would you raise your hands so I can see them?
[time=419] So I can't see a lot of people.
[time=421] How many already had one before?
[time=423] Yeah, ours is very loved at the Webster house.
[time=426] It's kind of coming apart.
[time=428] We start it, we finish it, we start all over again.
[time=431] I forgot how many times he'd been through it as a family.
[time=434] Everybody loves stories.
[time=436] And Ruth, which will begin today.
[time=439] Thank you, Corbin.
[time=440] So grateful for you.
[time=441] Ruth that will begin today is a story, a beautiful little story in the midst of the great story that God is telling in his word.
[time=451] And I was thinking about, I'm so glad that we got you copies of that.
[time=455] If you still want one, would you let us know?
[time=457] And we'll do our best to try to get you one as best as we can.
[time=460] But I thought about these words that are in the introduction that Josh Rang has read to you before, that we've rallied around before.
[time=466] I think it's worth repeating.
[time=468] I hear you have to hear something somewhere from four to 44 times to really remember it.
[time=472] So here's a chance.
[time=474] You ready? Listen.
[time=475] Some people think the Bible is a book of rules telling you what you should and shouldn't do.
[time=481] The Bible certainly does have some rules in it.
[time=484] They show you how life works best.
[time=486] But the Bible isn't mainly about you and what you should be doing.
[time=491] It's about God, what he has done.
[time=493] Other people think the Bible is a book of heroes showing you people you should copy.
[time=499] The Bible does have some heroes in it, but as you'll find out in Ruth, most of the people in the Bible aren't heroes at all.
[time=507] They make big mistakes, sometimes on purpose.
[time=510] They get afraid and run away and at times they're downright mean.
[time=514] No, the Bible isn't a book of rules or a book of heroes.
[time=516] The Bible is most of all a story.
[time=520] It's an adventure story about a young hero who comes from a far country to win back his lost treasure.
[time=525] It's a love story about a brave prince who leaves his palace, has thrown everything to rescue the one he loves.
[time=532] It's like the most wonderful of fairy tales come true in real life.
[time=537] The best thing about this story, it is true.
[time=540] There are lots of stories in the Bible, but all the stories, including Ruth, are telling one big story.
[time=547] The story of how God loves his children and comes to rescue them.
[time=551] It takes the whole Bible to tell this story.
[time=554] At the center of the story, there is a baby.
[time=556] Every story in the Bible whispers his name.
[time=559] He is like the missing piece in a puzzle, the piece that makes all the other pieces fit together, and suddenly you can see a beautiful picture.
[time=567] It's true, if you have your Bibles, if you go to the book of Ruth this morning, and as you go, I'll tell you another story.
[time=573] In the last days of the first President Bush administration,
[time=579] a young man went to go sojourn in the mountains of North Eastern Georgia.
[time=583] And to play basketball on this, he went there, he made a lot of friends and had a lot of fun and studied once in a while.
[time=592] And by his junior year of his sojourn in Georgia, he was calling his mom on the phone and saying things like, "Yeah, I'm fixing to go to dinner." And she'd be like, "What?" He would say, "I'm fixing to go to..." Oh, okay, so he had to translate, and so.
[time=607] The fall of his junior year, he took an Earth science class because some of his very helpful friends had said things like, "Well, he likes basketball players, doesn't..." "You don't have to worry about it, it's an easy A, no big deal.
[time=618] "Well, by semester exam time, this young man was in deep trouble "because he got bad information about Earth science "for some of his very helpful friends.
[time=626] "Things didn't go very well in Earth science, "and he had to leave that college and come back home and transfer." A few years later, a young woman went to go sojourn from Ohio to Kentucky to Asbury College.
[time=638] Asbury College, we know Asbury in the room.
[time=640] A few of you do, excellent.
[time=641] She went to go sojourn there and found out once she got there as a nursing major that she was gonna have to stay for five years because they had a dual credit thing with University of Kentucky.
[time=652] She goes, "I would rather do it in four." So she came back home, having loved Asbury, never intending to leave, came back home.
[time=658] Much like this young man left home for a reason and didn't wanna stay around to go to school.
[time=664] Well, it turns out, a few years later, that this young woman was on spring break with this young man's sister down in Florida, and the young man got word that there would be 12 college girls that his parents asked one night to have spaghetti.
[time=677] He thought, actually, he probably should go check that out just to be hospitable and to be a master of ceremonies and just be generally neighborly about the whole thing.
[time=685] And so, this young man, young woman, met that afternoon and 15 years later, we've been married for 15 years.
[time=695] That is me, actually, I know it doesn't seem that way, but that is me.
[time=698] We brought our photo albums to our small group as past week and someone said, "Steve, you look so much older "because I am so much older." But anyway, she looks the same.
[time=709] She's still that beautiful girl I married.
[time=711] Ruth is, friends, a love story.
[time=716] There are a whole lot of things that had to happen behind the scenes for me ever to meet, Jody.
[time=720] There are a whole lot of things that had to happen, sometimes really bad things that had to happen.
[time=726] For Ruth and eventually a man named Boaz to ever meet.
[time=730] And we have used these three words, K.B. will get to Providence next week, but these are words that we have rallied around in our study of Ruth that I think will be helpful to you.
[time=742] I think will be an encouragement to you.
[time=745] Let's begin with the word sovereignty.
[time=746] I wanted to define this word.
[time=747] It'll be up there for a while on the screen.
[time=749] Just so we're all playing by the same rules.
[time=751] Here's how we're defining sovereignty together throughout our series.
[time=757] When we say that God is sovereign, we mean that God has absolute control and rule over creation as king and total control and determination over all that happens.
[time=769] That's a very strong statement.
[time=772] It's worth repeating.
[time=773] God has absolute rule over creation as king and total control and determination over all that happens.
[time=780] There is not much middle ground there.
[time=783] Either we hold that to be true or we don't.
[time=785] What you believe about that friends probably will be very different around the room.
[time=788] And there are some hard questions to ask in light of that.
[time=791] If you want to talk about it, we'll be happy to talk with you after the service.
[time=796] But you see this sovereignty at work throughout this little book of Ruth.
[time=802] If you have your Bibles to Ruth, what book comes right before Ruth?
[time=805] Judges.
[time=808] If Ruth is this beautiful little story, this charming little tale, Judges is not.
[time=814] Judges is our rated.
[time=816] Judges is bleak.
[time=818] Judges reminds me of my days in Western Florida with my family in hurricanes.
[time=823] We had a hurricane.
[time=824] We had two hour delays.
[time=825] We had hurricane cancellations in Florida.
[time=829] Do you see at the middle of the hurricane, what is that in the middle?
[time=831] What's that called?
[time=832] It's called the eye.
[time=833] What's going on in the eye of the storm?
[time=836] Nothing.
[time=837] It's peaceful.
[time=838] It's quiet.
[time=839] There are stories of hurricanes passing over in years gone by, passing over neighborhoods.
[time=844] And people think, oh, this storm is over.
[time=845] They go outside only to have the back wall of the eye pass over in disaster strike.
[time=851] Well, Ruth is like the eye of a storm it never moves.
[time=854] It's this quiet little story amid this horrible awfulness happening in the book of Judges.
[time=860] If you have your Bibles again open to Judges, look at the last verse of the book.
[time=864] This last verse is a summary statement of the whole book.
[time=868] Here it is.
[time=870] In those days, there was no king in Israel.
[time=873] Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
[time=877] That's not a very good picture.
[time=880] No king, everyone playing by their own set of rules.
[time=882] And again, if you read Judges, fasten your seatbelts.
[time=886] It's very, very, very bleak.
[time=888] Ruth is this little story of a family.
[time=891] Faithfully pursuing God, I've heard from many of you say you love this story.
[time=893] I can't blame you.
[time=895] It's a beautiful story.
[time=897] Let me read you this really helpful summary statement that I found this week about Ruth that I think will be helpful to you.
[time=905] The little book of Ruth has drawn tributes from very many.
[time=910] It's even been described as the perfect story.
[time=913] It is indeed a splendid example of the storyteller's art.
[time=917] And it's more than a little interesting to find in this ancient book, A Tale, which conforms so exactly that the standards look for in a good story today in modern times.
[time=927] It's told simply and directly.
[time=930] Ruth is very easy to read.
[time=932] It deals with the period of the Judges, but it forms a contrast with the book of that name.
[time=937] Judges tells of war and strife and these endless cycles of oppression and deliverance and struggle.
[time=945] But Ruth is a quiet story of ordinary people going about their quiet lives.
[time=951] In one way, it's a tale of two women.
[time=953] It relates how one of them, Naomi, underwent much hardship, but eventually won through to peace and security, spoiler alert, sorry.
[time=962] Tells how the other, Ruth, attached herself firmly to her mother-in-law's God and how she received the blessing of that God.
[time=972] But most of all, the book is a book about God, but most of all, the book is a book about God.
[time=977] It deals with unimportant people and unimportant matters, but deals with them in such a way as to show that God is active in the affairs of men.
[time=988] He works his purpose out and blesses them that trust him.
[time=993] That's a great summary statement of the book and what you're gonna see.
[time=996] I cannot wait to watch it unfold with you.
[time=999] It's terribly exciting to see these things that God will do among us.
[time=1005] Would you stand with me as we read the first five verses or so and get a sense of it and then we'll pray and then we'll launch in?
[time=1015] I can't wait to actually tell you this story and come alongside it.
[time=1019] Ruth chapter one.
[time=1023] In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land and a man of Bethlehem in Judah went to Sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.
[time=1036] The name of the man was Olimalek and the name of his wife, Naomi.
[time=1041] The names of his two sons were Maelon and Killian.
[time=1044] They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah.
[time=1047] They went into the country of Moab and remained there, but Olimalek, the husband of Naomi, died and she was left with her two sons.
[time=1056] These took Moabite wives, and the name of the one was Orpa, the name of the other, Ruth.
[time=1061] They lived there about 10 years and both Maelon and Killian died.
[time=1066] So the woman was left without her two sons and her husband.
[time=1071] Let's pray as we begin.
[time=1073] Heavenly Father, I pray you give us eyes to see and ears to hear what you would have us to see in here from your word this morning.
[time=1078] I pray all that in Jesus' name.
[time=1080] Amen, you may be seated.
[time=1082] There is an outline in your bulletins, one more trip to your bulletin.
[time=1087] There is an outline with some notes in your bulletin.
[time=1089] You're welcome to go there.
[time=1090] Roman number one is entitled A Famine and A Visit.
[time=1095] There is a lot going on here in the first chapter.
[time=1098] And I'm gonna try real hard not to tell you the rest of the story, but it's gonna be hard.
[time=1103] Chapter one, A Famine and A Visit.
[time=1107] And we see right away in the first verse, a crisis.
[time=1112] Letter A there is crisis.
[time=1117] In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land.
[time=1119] Guys, in those days, for now, for us day, if there's long periods of no rain, we can get our food from all over the world.
[time=1129] We aren't in any danger.
[time=1130] They didn't have that ability.
[time=1132] So if there was a famine somewhere, they had to go somewhere else where there actually was rain and there was food.
[time=1137] There's no water.
[time=1139] There's no water, there's no crops.
[time=1140] No crops you don't eat.
[time=1141] They were tied like third world countries are today dependent on either God makes it rain or God doesn't.
[time=1148] Nothing happened by accident.
[time=1151] Filed that away.
[time=1152] Nothing happens by accident.
[time=1154] A man of Bethlehem in Judah went to Sojourn to stay for a little while in the country of Moab.
[time=1161] He and his wife and his two sons.
[time=1166] This is how he leaves, how Naomi leaves with the husband, with two sons out to Moab.
[time=1173] Moab is a country that's to the south and to the east of Judah across the Jordan River.
[time=1179] More on that in just a minute.
[time=1181] This man's name, we find out in verse two, his name is Olimalek.
[time=1185] The name Olimalek means God is my king.
[time=1189] Just so happens, his name was God is my king.
[time=1192] So even Olimalek's troubles, even his name reminds us that God is sovereign, that he rules as king over all things and everything comes from his hand.
[time=1203] That my friends is the big idea from this week.
[time=1206] It's also in your bulletin.
[time=1207] The every good thing in our lives comes from the hand of a good God.
[time=1213] A God who sovereignly and providentially works redemption for his people.
[time=1219] This is in your bulletin, it's actually printed out there.
[time=1222] Every good thing in our lives flows from the hand of a good God.
[time=1226] A God who sovereignly and providentially works redemption for his people.
[time=1231] Olimalek does not know how this story ends.
[time=1234] He does not alive to find out.
[time=1237] But I think we'll see as the story plays out that God has his hand even in these difficult things.
[time=1243] Perhaps especially in these difficult things.
[time=1246] More on that in a moment.
[time=1248] He does what he needs to preserve his family.
[time=1250] Other commentators say that he'd made a bad choice to go chase these things down.
[time=1254] I'm not so sure.
[time=1256] Abraham goes to a foreign country to soldier in there.
[time=1258] So does his son Isaac, so does his son Jacob.
[time=1261] So I don't know.
[time=1262] I won't sit in judgment of Olimalek today.
[time=1264] I think he's trying to keep his family alive and does what he has to do.
[time=1267] And there he is.
[time=1269] Name of his wife Naomi.
[time=1271] Name of his two sons were Maelon and Killian.
[time=1273] Dear friends, the Bible grows up in the soil of space and time.
[time=1277] It's real, if you guys shout out right here.
[time=1280] You guys in my classes know that the Bible deals with, it's not Narnia or Middle Earth.
[time=1287] These are real places with real people.
[time=1289] And so I think we can take some special comfort in that.
[time=1291] Ruth is a story, friends.
[time=1293] But again, from the quote, it's a true story.
[time=1296] That's the greatest thing about all of it.
[time=1299] It isn't just a story.
[time=1301] It's a true story.
[time=1302] It's a love story.
[time=1303] Come true in real life and it's wonderful.
[time=1306] Affirming God's sovereignty.
[time=1312] Olimalek goes off this foreign land and dies there.
[time=1315] His sons die, they take wives there and his sons both die and they have no kids.
[time=1320] So Ruth and Orpa, their wives die widows.
[time=1325] Their husbands die, leave them widows and they have no children.
[time=1328] We are not asking you this morning to be fatalistic, that you have no control over things that happen to you in your life and you have to just kind of bravely face these faceless problems that come your way.
[time=1340] That's fatalism.
[time=1341] That's not what we're affirming today.
[time=1342] We're affirming God's sovereignty.
[time=1344] Fatalism is impersonal.
[time=1345] Fatalism is just kind of grin and bear it, do your best.
[time=1349] That's not what God's sovereignty is.
[time=1351] God's sovereignty is intensely personal and asks you to trust that God knows what he's doing.
[time=1356] I pray you give us the faith to do it.
[time=1361] Everything in Ruth is intensely personal.
[time=1362] They have names.
[time=1363] They have a hometown.
[time=1365] They have a clan.
[time=1366] They have a family.
[time=1367] Just like us.
[time=1372] Bethlehem actually means house of bread.
[time=1374] Do you know that?
[time=1375] Date lechem, house of bread.
[time=1378] They leave the house of bread to go surgeon in Moab.
[time=1380] My God is my king.
[time=1382] Leaves house of bread to go surgeon.
[time=1384] Nothing by accident.
[time=1387] Not even these place names are accidental.
[time=1390] Moab, Moab south and east of Judah.
[time=1394] The country of Moab you may know came to be through Lot and his daughters.
[time=1402] God reigns fire from the sky, destroy southern than Gomorrah.
[time=1407] Lot and his daughters have no husband.
[time=1408] They have no kids.
[time=1409] And to preserve Lot's line, they lay with their father and they have two sons named Moab and Ammon.
[time=1415] Moab and Moabites and the Ammonites.
[time=1417] Long-standing enemies of Israel.
[time=1419] There would be no Ruth, no Orpa if there were no Moabites.
[time=1426] Is God sovereign over this nation's existence?
[time=1431] Is God sovereign in making things wonderful from things ugly and things I have a heart to be sharing to you from this pulpit?
[time=1438] Things like that.
[time=1440] Does he have the same right to do that in our lives?
[time=1446] Joseph in Genesis 50, you know this verse.
[time=1450] I take in great comfort from this verse this week and I hope you do too.
[time=1453] You know the story that Joseph is horrifically wronged.
[time=1457] Joseph's brother's settlement is slavery.
[time=1459] He's imprisoned, he's falsely accused.
[time=1461] All these things happen to Joseph that were not of his choosing.
[time=1466] He was simply receiving them as they came.
[time=1469] As for you, he's talking to his brothers now years later, as for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good.
[time=1479] God meant his imprisonment, his false accusations,
[time=1485] taken away from his family.
[time=1486] Everything he'd ever known for good.
[time=1489] To bring it about that many people would be alive as they are today.
[time=1492] It just so happens by coincidence that while Joseph is in Egypt, he super-intends a grain-saving program that goes on to save his own family one day.
[time=1503] God knows what he's doing.
[time=1505] Can I get an amen for that, please?
[time=1507] God knows what he's doing.
[time=1509] And I know there are times that it's hard to believe that.
[time=1512] I know that.
[time=1513] I don't know your story.
[time=1514] I won't condescend to you like I do.
[time=1517] Like I know you're suffering and you're struggling.
[time=1519] I don't, but God does.
[time=1521] And nothing in your life that you're facing.
[time=1524] Some of you are facing incredibly hard things this year, right now.
[time=1527] Some of you are involved in circumstances that you didn't choose, and you're facing really difficult things.
[time=1534] And I would ask you to trust him.
[time=1538] That through hardship and through trial and through pain, God knows what he's doing.
[time=1543] There is crisis, so we have a famine and a visit.
[time=1546] We have crisis in verse one, but we also now, as the story plays out, we have a course.
[time=1550] Elimalic dies.
[time=1553] His two sons die after taking mobile wives.
[time=1556] Tragedy upon tragedy.
[time=1559] The woman was left without her two sons and her husband.
[time=1564] Verse five, it says, the woman, Naomi.
[time=1567] Then she arose, verse six.
[time=1571] Then she arose with her daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab, because, verse six, because she had heard in the fields of Moab that the Lord had visited his people and given them food.
[time=1584] If you're inclined to mark in your Bible, it's the most important verse in the whole book of Ruth.
[time=1587] Verse six, so please mark it if you choose.
[time=1590] Everything else that happens in Ruth is dominoes that fall because that happened.
[time=1595] God moves freely.
[time=1597] God moves first to bring deliverance.
[time=1599] We used the word sovereignty earlier friends.
[time=1601] We also used the word redemption in the window box that Lord put together beautifully out in the foyer.
[time=1607] Redemption is we use that word in Ruth means simply deliverance or rescue.
[time=1613] That the Lord has visited his people, means that he has brought deliverance and rescue to them.
[time=1619] That's what it means.
[time=1621] Every good thing in our lives flows from the hand of a good God.
[time=1625] A God who sovereignly and providentially works redemption for his people.
[time=1630] Sometimes through things that we don't and may never understand.
[time=1635] Oftentimes that way, Genesis 12 says a story of Abram that in Abram all the families of the earth will be blessed.
[time=1641] Ultimately in Jesus Christ, who is in Abram's line, ultimately the line of David, more on that later.
[time=1649] We are not responsible for the things that happen to us.
[time=1654] But we are responsible for how we react to the things that happen to us.
[time=1662] God moves to bring deliverance to his people and Naomi takes her letter V course in response, crisis and course.
[time=1669] Naomi's course is set.
[time=1671] She's headed out, she went out, she moved.
[time=1674] She didn't stay, she moved, she arose because she heard the Lord had visited his people.
[time=1681] It reminds me of Luke 178 and Zacharias' words about his son, John the Baptist.
[time=1686] Luke 178 says, "Because of the tender mercy of our God,
[time=1692] whereby the sunrise from on high shall visit us." He describes his son will be a prophet of the most high and will tell the story of the sunrise who is to come.
[time=1705] Everything before Christ is the darkness, everything after him is the light.
[time=1709] That's the picture Zacharias paints.
[time=1711] So are there echoes in Ruth of another visit yet to come thousands of years later?
[time=1715] I think so.
[time=1718] As the digging deeper document says, this picture of redemption, this little pebble with these ripples that go out, these ripples of redemption and salvation and God's working to bring deliverance for his people.
[time=1729] It's all happening there.
[time=1731] Everything in Ruth is set in motion by what happens in one verse six.
[time=1734] God has given his people food.
[time=1738] He withheld it and now it gives it for his own reasons.
[time=1741] He knows what he's doing.
[time=1742] I know that's hard to believe that friends.
[time=1745] I know it.
[time=1746] I've lived it in my own life.
[time=1750] Naomi arose, it says, to return in verse six.
[time=1755] That word return is used 12 times in chapter one.
[time=1761] Return, return, return.
[time=1762] 12 times, her course is set.
[time=1766] Roman numeral two in your notes is about two sisters who have very different responses to Naomi's struggle.
[time=1772] Two sisters, look at verse seven with me.
[time=1776] She set out from the place where she was with her two daughters in the law and they, plural, they went on on the way to return to the land of Judah.
[time=1786] All those verbs indicate movement.
[time=1788] She set out.
[time=1789] She went to return movement, movement, movement.
[time=1791] She's on the move somewhere.
[time=1792] Verse eight, notice that her two daughters in the law go, return each of you to her mother's house.
[time=1798] May the Lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me.
[time=1803] I just observe girls that it's possible to get along with your mother-in-law.
[time=1807] It's possible you can do it.
[time=1810] You're welcome.
[time=1811] Okay.
[time=1812] May the Lord deal kindly with you.
[time=1814] This is a great word.
[time=1816] It's fun to say in Hebrew, the word is chesed.
[time=1818] Wanna say it with me?
[time=1820] Chesed, down your throat down there, it's fun.
[time=1822] It means loving kindness.
[time=1823] They had to make up a word in English to describe what chesed means.
[time=1828] It means loving kindness.
[time=1829] God has shown chesed to you.
[time=1833] May he show chesed to you as you showed it to me.
[time=1837] It's a gracious action performed from one person to the other, from a person who has the means to meet somebody else's needs to that person who is needed.
[time=1848] That's what Hesse does.
[time=1849] And God is the ultimate dispenser of this loving kindness.
[time=1853] He does it all the time.
[time=1854] He's good.
[time=1855] Morn that later to you.
[time=1857] Verse nine, the Lord grant that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband, then she kissed them and they looked at their voices and they wept.
[time=1867] Why?
[time=1868] I think, this is my opinion, we'll get you out the door,
[time=1874] I think that they know if they leave Naomi that Naomi will not make it.
[time=1878] They know for sure she'll die childish, childless rather, no heir, no one to carry on her husband's name.
[time=1886] If they leave and go back to their Moabite families, that's it for Naomi and for a limalek.
[time=1890] The whole line is extinguished and they grieve over this.
[time=1894] They weep, verse 10.
[time=1897] So I said to her, no, we'll return with you to your people.
[time=1901] Naomi said verse 11, turn back my daughters.
[time=1907] Why will you go with me?
[time=1909] Have I yet sons in my womb that they may become your husbands?
[time=1911] Turn back my daughters, go your way.
[time=1914] For I am too old to have a husband.
[time=1916] If I should say I have hope, if I should have a husband this very night and bear sons, would you therefore wait till they're grown?
[time=1922] Would you therefore refrain from marrying?
[time=1924] No, my daughters, my daughters, my daughters, my daughters.
[time=1928] These three verses, these women love each other.
[time=1930] They really do, it's possible, ladies.
[time=1933] It's exceedingly bitter to me for your sake, the hand of the Lord has gone out against me.
[time=1938] Nothing, Naomi understands that nothing happens by accident and she has received from God bitterness.
[time=1946] But there is a remarkable bond between these ladies, a remarkable bond.
[time=1954] It's a little, verses a little bit awkward toward the end there and the new living translation says it this way, things are far more bitter for me than for you in new living translation because the Lord himself has raised his fist against me.
[time=1965] That's hard.
[time=1967] She recognizes that things don't happen by chance or by accident.
[time=1973] She faces widowhood and aloneness for the rest of her life unlike Ruth and Orpa.
[time=1981] So there's a different reaction from the two girls to these strong words from Naomi that God's raised his fist against me and so they both go, "Whew." They both wept again in verse 14.
[time=1992] Orpa kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, is implied there, but Ruth clung to her.
[time=1998] Do you see in your notes there, Genesis 224?
[time=2001] That's a verse that says that a man will leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife.
[time=2006] Same word.
[time=2007] This is a very close bond between Ruth and her mother-in-law.
[time=2010] She clung to her, she held fast to her, to her.
[time=2014] And so we have Litter A, a departure.
[time=2017] Orpa leaves, she is departed, she's gone.
[time=2021] Verse 15, Naomi said, "See, sister-in-law is going back
[time=2029] "to her people and to her gods." Turn on for your sister-in-law.
[time=2031] It's okay.
[time=2032] Ruth said, "Do not urge me." The English translation says, "Stop urging me to abandon you.
[time=2041] "Don't urge me to leave you "or return from following you, verse 16, "for where you go, famous words, "for where you go, I will go, "and where you lodge, I will lodge.
[time=2050] "Your people will be my people and your God, my God.
[time=2054] "Where you die, I will die, verse 17, "and there will I be buried.
[time=2058] "May the Lord do so to me and more also "if anything but death parts me from you." Wow.
[time=2066] Hard to imagine stronger words from Ruth there, isn't it?
[time=2070] And so verse 18, when Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more.
[time=2075] Let her be his determination.
[time=2076] Same situation, produces two very different responses.
[time=2081] One says, "I'm out of here." One says, "I'm going." And so we all have, we all are responsible to respond well to God's sovereignty.
[time=2093] That's what we're responsible for.
[time=2097] How do I respond?
[time=2099] Ruth responds well, orpa does not.
[time=2101] Galatians six, verse two, is what Ruth is doing.
[time=2105] She says, it says, "In Galatians six, "you bear one another's burdens, "and so fulfill the law of Christ.
[time=2112] "I'm so grateful for my friends this week "who have helped me bear my burdens.
[time=2116] "I'm grateful that you have people in your life "that can help you bear your burdens." Are you grateful for that this morning?
[time=2123] And so fulfill, it says the law of Christ.
[time=2126] There is a real beautiful truth in there, friends.
[time=2129] We need to rally around.
[time=2130] That's why the church exists.
[time=2131] That's why we are the church, the body of Christ.
[time=2134] All different parts, all working together.
[time=2137] We need each other.
[time=2138] Please don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together.
[time=2142] Don't miss opportunities before you to fellowship and to hear from other people and to pray with them and for them.
[time=2149] Please don't miss it.
[time=2153] Letter three, letter three, gracious, mercy, number, whatever.
[time=2157] Roman rule three is bitterness and beginning.
[time=2162] Here we, the story rounds out with a rather remarkable end.
[time=2166] Bitterness and beginning, verse 19.
[time=2172] So the two of them is not great.
[time=2176] The two of them went on, not just one.
[time=2179] 'Til they came to Bethlehem.
[time=2182] And when they came to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred.
[time=2185] The whole town was buzzing because of them, because Naomi left with a husband and two sons and they aren't there.
[time=2192] What has happened?
[time=2193] Ooh, there's a noise about them.
[time=2196] Who was this girl?
[time=2197] The women said, "Is this Naomi?" I think they whispered it, "Is this Naomi?" She said to them, "Do not call me Naomi.
[time=2208] Do not call me pleasant." What Naomi means, pleasant, repleasing.
[time=2212] "Call me Mara," it says.
[time=2214] Call me bitter.
[time=2215] The Lord, the Almighty, for Shaddai is the word for God there.
[time=2221] For the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
[time=2223] I went away full and the Lord has brought me back empty.
[time=2227] Why call me Naomi?
[time=2228] When the Lord has testified against me and the Almighty has brought calamity, brought me back empty, testified against me, brought calamity on me.
[time=2238] Nothing happens by chance to Naomi.
[time=2240] You are never asked by God.
[time=2243] Hear me.
[time=2244] We are never asked by God to deny the reality of our suffering.
[time=2250] Never.
[time=2251] Act like it isn't there.
[time=2252] That's not what the Psalms say.
[time=2255] The Psalms are filled up with mourning and lamentation and cries to God for help.
[time=2261] So I think Naomi is on the right path here, but she doesn't keep going.
[time=2264] The Psalms keep going.
[time=2266] Yet I will trust in you, O Lord, they say.
[time=2268] They don't deny their suffering and hurting, but they just keep going.
[time=2272] She stops.
[time=2273] So, a couple of questions as we round out this portion of the service.
[time=2278] Letter A, number A.
[time=2280] Letter A in your outline.
[time=2283] I think it's there.
[time=2284] What are you called?
[time=2286] Maybe we can say this.
[time=2287] What will you be called?
[time=2288] Naomi leaves pleasant.
[time=2293] She comes back bitter.
[time=2295] And has God dealt harshly with her?
[time=2298] Yes.
[time=2299] He has.
[time=2300] But the women don't respond in the text, right?
[time=2303] Just left there.
[time=2304] Kind of like, oh, you're right.
[time=2308] You have been dealt with a tough hand.
[time=2310] Nothing else said about it in the text.
[time=2314] So don't leave it there as my encouragement to you.
[time=2317] I thought about Psalm 68 this morning.
[time=2320] Psalm 68, this is the same name for God used by the way by Naomi here.
[time=2326] And she uses this name for God, the Almighty, all throughout the book that name Shaddai.
[time=2330] When the Almighty scatters kings there, Psalm 68 verse 14, let snow fall on zalman.
[time=2338] Oh, mountain of God, mountain of Bishan, the many peaked mountain for 16.
[time=2342] What do you look with hatred of many peaked mountain at the mountain that God desired for His dwelling place, His abode?
[time=2350] Where the Lord will dwell forever?
[time=2352] The chariots of God are twice 10,000, thousands upon thousands.
[time=2358] The Lord is among them.
[time=2360] Sinai is now in the sanctuary.
[time=2362] You ascended on high, leading a host of captives behind you in your train, receiving gifts from men, even among the rebellious, that the Lord God may dwell there.
[time=2371] Paul quotes those verses in Ephesians 4 in response to his own suffering.
[time=2375] Paul, I'm a prisoner of the Lord.
[time=2376] Paul says in Ephesians 4, he recounts those verses as perspective for him.
[time=2383] She describes the reality of her suffering under the divine sovereign hand of God.
[time=2388] And at least to your friends, fails to recognize that everything, not only every good thing, but every thing in our lives, flows from the hand of a good God who sovereignly and providentially works redemption for His people.
[time=2401] The second question after what will you be called,
[time=2407] or what do you call it as number B?
[time=2409] I did it again.
[time=2410] Let it be.
[time=2411] What are you gonna do?
[time=2412] I am impressed that Naomi faces these incredibly hard circumstance.
[time=2418] She still gets up and goes back to Judah.
[time=2420] And she goes back to Bethlehem.
[time=2421] It just so happens.
[time=2422] She goes to Bethlehem by coincidence.
[time=2425] I heard someone define luck one time as luck is when God chooses to remain anonymous.
[time=2430] I think that's true.
[time=2433] I don't think that they were lucky.
[time=2434] And up where they ended up, I know they weren't.
[time=2437] Naomi returned verse 22 and Ruth the Moabite.
[time=2444] Didn't have to say Ruth the Moabite, but there it is, Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law with her.
[time=2451] By the way, Naomi's all she's in a bad place 'cause she says she came back empty and like Ruth isn't even there.
[time=2457] So Naomi's in a bad place.
[time=2462] And God doesn't want you to lose sight of the tough things that have happened to you, but to trust him in the wake of them.
[time=2473] You can trust him.
[time=2474] She responds and acts in a way that will place her and Ruth in a position to receive kindness from God.
[time=2481] The band's coming back up this morning.
[time=2484] Come back up you guys.
[time=2485] As they come, I wanna read in conclusion with you this beautiful Psalm 113.
[time=2491] And I actually found it in the middle of the week in connection with this passage and I was just overwhelmed.
[time=2497] I think it's a very appropriate response to what we've heard this morning.
[time=2504] What will you be called?
[time=2505] Do you be called pleasant or bitter?
[time=2507] What will you be known as?
[time=2508] I guess is what we could say there.
[time=2510] How will you be known?
[time=2511] And Alice, what are you gonna do?
[time=2514] What are you gonna do?
[time=2516] I hope you end up here, Psalm 113.
[time=2518] Praise the Lord.
[time=2521] Hallelujah.
[time=2523] Praise O servants of the Lord.
[time=2524] Praise the name of the Lord.
[time=2526] Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and forevermore.
[time=2531] From the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the Lord is to be praised.
[time=2535] The Lord is high above all nations.
[time=2539] His glory above the heavens.
[time=2541] Who is like the Lord our God?
[time=2542] Who is seated on high?
[time=2544] Who looks far down on the heavens and the earth?
[time=2546] He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with princes, with the princes of his people.
[time=2557] He gives the barren woman a home, making her the joyous mother of children, friends.
[time=2567] We may trust him through great difficulty, trial and pain.
[time=2573] Trust his love that we'll sing about right now, his love for us, strong, sure, steadfast.
[time=2582] There's no translation of Hesse'd as steadfast love.
[time=2587] Let's sing about it together in response.
