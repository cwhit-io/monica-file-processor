[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again, and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] It's great to have you with us, and I'm so thankful today to have a good friend of mine and a great friend of Black Hawks, and really probably to most of you, a good friend of the community, Mr. Curtis Smith.
[time=47] - Hey, bud. - Hey, Kelly.
[time=47] - Good to see you. - Good to see you.
[time=49] - Yeah, thanks.
[time=50] I'm grateful on a number of fronts for a few minutes with Curtis here.
[time=55] Curtis and Jesse have been a part of the Black Hawk family for a number of years.
[time=60] They've been in Fort Wayne for a number of years, and at 21 alive for a number of years.
[time=65] Curtis, catch me up.
[time=66] When did you and Jesse and the family first come to Fort Wayne?
[time=70] - October '95.
[time=73] - All right. - And it was weird circumstances.
[time=75] We were in Louisiana.
[time=77] We had just become pregnant with our first child, who's now a junior in high school.
[time=81] - Wow.
[time=81] - And we kind of thought, well, we'll stay in Louisiana, we'll have this baby, and then we'll start to look elsewhere, 'cause we really weren't happy in Louisiana.
[time=89] - We weren't in Louisiana. - We weren't in Louisiana.
[time=93] - Got a call in total. - Were you doing weather?
[time=94] - Doing weather there, yeah. - All right.
[time=96] - And got a call out of the blue from a girl who worked here in Fort Wayne.
[time=100] You know, kind of pre-internet days, we busted out an atlas to figure out where Fort Wayne was.
[time=105] - We knew.
[time=106] We knew it was in Indiana, but we didn't know what part, and that was October of '95.
[time=111] And so here we are, 17, 18 years later.
[time=113] - My goodness. - Still here.
[time=114] - Wow, that's great. - Yeah.
[time=116] - As you made your way to Fort Wayne, and you started to get settled, then, how did Blackhawk happen?
[time=122] How did you end up coming to church and being a part of this place?
[time=125] - You know, some people would call it luck, but I just think it was a God thing.
[time=129] When we got to the station, Jesse was pregnant, and so we needed a doctor instantly.
[time=135] And at the station, Marty Wright said, "Hey, John Branderberger is on our air doing a segment on our new news occasionally." - Yeah.
[time=147] - And he's a doctor, obviously.
[time=147] You should talk to him.
[time=148] And so we talked to John.
[time=151] He took us in as patients right as we got here in town, and then while we were there, he instantly was talking to us about where you plugged in for church, and he gave us tickets to the living Christmas tree.
[time=163] - Wow. - That was back in the day.
[time=164] - Yeah, back in December of '95, and we were sold and we came to the Christmas tree and thought, "This is it?" - That's great.
[time=171] (laughing) - That's great.
[time=173] - Yeah, was whether meteorology, all that stuff, was that something that you always dreamed of doing?
[time=179] - Yeah, you know, as you know, I'm a huge sports fan.
[time=182] - Yes.
[time=183] - And so I kind of saw myself in that light for a while, but then yeah, weather is just so fascinating, and it's such a, it's so interesting, and I love the challenge of trying to predict the future, so. - Yes.
[time=194] - I kind of always had a TV background for a while with sports, but then kind of shifted to weather, and-- - There's a little bit of profit.
[time=199] A little bit of profit in you, isn't there?
[time=201] (laughing) - Just a little bit.
[time=203] - Just don't get it wrong.
[time=206] - Yeah.
[time=207] - Hey, not as a pat on the back by any stretch, but I just think it's great for people to hear about.
[time=213] Your family, Jesse, the kids, the boys, how has Blackhawk, and you think about the church, the school, the ministry here as a whole, how has Blackhawk been an encouragement to the Smiths?
[time=226] - I mean, seriously, we need to do a documentary on that.
[time=230] I mean, I could go on for an hour.
[time=232] I mean, it's our church home.
[time=234] My kids, all three boys have gone here since kindergarten.
[time=237] My wife teaches art now for the last few years at Blackhawk.
[time=242] Now she teaches exclusively on the junior high and senior high side, and absolutely loves that.
[time=248] And so, it's our circle.
[time=251] It's our whole life.
[time=252] It's tied up in Blackhawk church school.
[time=256] It's what we do every day, is Blackhawk.
[time=259] - Yeah.
[time=260] - Well, we're glad, thankful to have you and Jesse and the boys as part of this family.
[time=264] You know, as part of this family, that we make, and this is kind of why I had Curtis come today.
[time=270] You know, we make a really big deal about going.
[time=274] We enjoy gathering.
[time=277] We appreciate the chance God gives us to learn, to have investment, spiritual investment made in us.
[time=285] But we also know that all that's for not if we don't go.
[time=288] And we talk about being priests who pass along God to others.
[time=293] And you've got an opportunity coming up, and I'm gonna invite you, if you will, to come back.
[time=299] We're gonna shoot a second segment, but I can't wait for you all to hear about the opportunity God has given Curtis and Jesse to go here in the days to come.
[time=309] I think it'll encourage and inspire you.
[time=311] And I'm so thankful that we get to be a part of it.
[time=314] So thank you for being part of our family.
[time=316] - Absolutely. - And thanks for joining me today.
[time=318] We'll be back next time.
[time=319] And until then, thank you for being a part of our viewing audience.
[time=323] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=325] God bless and have a great week.
[time=327] [MUSIC - 140 seconds]
[time=472] - Hey, I'm glad Rod Ovid is with me this morning.
[time=480] Everybody say good morning to Rod.
[time=482] Say hi, Rod.
[time=483] Rod and Carolyn Ovid have been a part of our family for years.
[time=487] Rod and Carolyn have been, I've said this before publicly.
[time=490] I don't mind saying it again.
[time=492] They helped me on a number of fronts, not the least of which is Rod and Carolyn are really scholars.
[time=498] They're really students of.
[time=499] They really do great work in teaching the scriptures.
[time=504] As many of you know, they founded, we founded Together Logos Institute of Biblical Studies.
[time=509] We house it here and it's in other places around our community.
[time=513] But we've just got this huge commitment here to teach the word of God in a way that makes sense, in a way that's deep, in a way that's relevant and meaningful.
[time=522] And one of the things that Rod has just gifted at is bringing background and historical context to teaching.
[time=529] And I'm grateful for the way he's done that with me.
[time=531] I want Rod to just share with you for a couple of minutes about Ruth, about the book of Ruth and its place in this thing we call the scriptures and just some of the insights that he had for me on this.
[time=543] I wanted him to share with you.
[time=544] So take it away, boss.
[time=546] - Thank you very much.
[time=547] Good morning.
[time=548] - Morning.
[time=549] How many think Ruth is a love story?
[time=552] Yeah, we've read it, it's a love story.
[time=555] Would you be surprised if I told you it was actually a historical book?
[time=560] Now, the English scholars, in our Bible, we categorize things and they've put Ruth solidly in the history category.
[time=570] But in ancient days, the Jewish scholars, they didn't have a category called history.
[time=575] They had three categories.
[time=577] They had one that was the Torah, the law, one that was the prophetic writings, the prophecies and such, and then a category called the writings.
[time=588] Well, they didn't have to call that history.
[time=593] Everyone knew that the writings were history.
[time=595] You say, how is that?
[time=596] How many watch the history channel?
[time=598] Oh, you guys, come on.
[time=599] I know the guys watch the history channel.
[time=602] Part of our job is to debunk the history channel in many, in many ways.
[time=607] All right, well, the history channel, we all love to watch this stuff because it's all this collective information.
[time=613] Well, a lot of that happened at the enlightenment period in the 1700s.
[time=619] Before that, in ancient days, history served one purpose and one purpose only and that was to tell a story.
[time=626] To tell a story about the king.
[time=629] To tell the story about the kingdom, whether it was a war, whether it was advancing, whatever, it was to tell a story.
[time=638] Well, the Bible is that way.
[time=642] The Bible is written to tell the story of our king, of our God.
[time=647] The Bible is God's self-revelation, as we'll see.
[time=651] So, all these stories, all these documents in the Old Testament are written for one purpose only and that is to talk about the king and our God.
[time=662] So, in reality, Ruth is a history book.
[time=665] Peter had that in mind when he wrote
[time=671] this verse in Second Peter 1, 16.
[time=674] For we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty.
[time=687] See, the eyewitnesses, we would call that history.
[time=691] See, since the enlightenment, we want all this empirical stuff, nothing but the facts, ma'am, nothing but the facts.
[time=696] If you know that quote, you're old, okay?
[time=699] But anyway, okay, Joe Friday, we all got it.
[time=702] All right, I see some of you guys.
[time=704] So, we have nothing but the facts is our attitude toward it, but there's a lot more to it.
[time=709] See, if you think that the story of Ruth is about Ruth,
[time=715] I want you to think a little bigger.
[time=720] Is it the story of Naomi?
[time=722] Well, sure.
[time=723] Naomi goes away, she changes her name to bitter.
[time=727] At the end, she's blessed with a grandchild, not just a grandchild, but the grandfather of David in the line of the Messiah.
[time=734] But I want you to think a little bigger.
[time=739] Is it the story of the people of God?
[time=742] Why yes, it is.
[time=744] In Ruth, we find how God providentially takes care of His people in His own.
[time=749] We see a lot of His care for His people, but I want you to think even bigger.
[time=755] 'Cause it's bigger than the story of Ruth.
[time=757] It's bigger than the story of Naomi.
[time=759] It's bigger than the story of the Jewish history.
[time=762] It's a story of God.
[time=764] The Bible is God's self-revelation.
[time=770] It's His story.
[time=773] [AMEN] Amen, thank Rod for just giving us some time and some input, very true and very helpful, very true and very helpful, thankful for His investment in my life.
[time=788] Hey, I want to just draw your attention real quick.
[time=791] Eat, come on up, draw your attention to the bulletin.
[time=793] Please everybody, I want you to know how much time and effort has been invested in the new digging deeper curriculum, the new digging deeper insert.
[time=801] This is for you to take home and further your own study and your own thought and your own thinking on this morning's message and on the back.
[time=809] Bless her heart, Janice and her team have done such a tremendous job of giving everybody a chance to work through this around the table.
[time=818] With your kids, with your family, with friends, we've talked recently about the great priority or the great reprioritization that our table time at home needs and so here's a great instrument, a great tool within which you can get that done.
[time=833] Ruth, chapter two this morning, grateful for Webby and the message you brought last week on Ruth one, Ruth, chapter two this morning.
[time=842] And as you turn and open your Bibles to Ruth, chapter two, I want you to look at the screen.
[time=847] There's a phrase I want you to become familiar with today as we start our time.
[time=851] When you look there, it says, and as it happened, and as it happened, you see that?
[time=860] She found herself working in a field belonging to Boas.
[time=865] I want everybody in the room to repeat that phrase.
[time=867] Repeat after me as it happened, say it.
[time=870] - As it happened.
[time=871] - And as it happened, what's that sound like to you?
[time=876] And as it happened, and as it so happened,
[time=884] and as things fell into place
[time=891] or I don't know what comes to your mind but I want you to think about that phrase.
[time=895] I mean it, this is going to be really important for our study and our discussion this morning.
[time=900] And as it happened, she finds herself working in a field belonging to Boas.
[time=909] Approaching spring break, 1983.
[time=914] I was 20 years old and as far from God as you could imagine.
[time=921] I'll spare you the details.
[time=923] Still reeling from the confusion and pain of my parents unraveling marriage along with my own unceasing and increasing rebellion in March of 1983.
[time=934] I was preparing to numb that pain a little more with a trip to Acapulco, Mexico with about 10 other guys from the fraternity I had started to associate with.
[time=947] So I think you get the picture.
[time=948] It wasn't a missions trip.
[time=952] A week before departure, my mom who was herself hurting and still confused, called and asked, oh what a phone call this was.
[time=964] If I would come and visit her during my break, she wondered if I had made plans.
[time=970] Home was now LA.
[time=973] They had moved from the Bay Area.
[time=975] My parents had moved from the Bay Area in an effort to be reconciled and work with some friends and try and salvage that situation.
[time=982] And so I gave my ticket to a friend and drove my Dodge Colt to Southern California where it just so happened.
[time=996] Then on my first day there, I got a call from an old friend named Matt who I'd known for years growing up.
[time=1007] Our families had been friends.
[time=1008] And he was my age, a college student, just like me.
[time=1013] And you heard I was in town, so we connected and he introduces me over the next few days to five other guys, Rod, Greg, Paul, Scott and Dave.
[time=1025] All of them friends to this day.
[time=1036] And the seven of us hung out all week long.
[time=1039] Six guys, six guys with great character.
[time=1046] Six guys who at age 20 had this huge love for and commitment to God.
[time=1050] I hadn't been around guys who had hearts for anything but themselves and stuff we won't mention for years leading up to this.
[time=1058] And they took me in and they befriended me and we had a lot of fun that week, good, clean, fun.
[time=1065] We went to movies that were appropriate and we went to the beach and we went to games and they even took me to their Bible study.
[time=1077] That Friday night, I'll never forget it.
[time=1079] And as it happened, I found myself in LA for a week
[time=1087] with six guys who were spiritually intentional and their kindness toward me.
[time=1095] And I use that word kindness 'cause the Bible says in Romans four, I think it's Romans four.
[time=1101] It says the kindness of the Lord leads us to what?
[time=1105] Repentance, kindness as it happened.
[time=1110] And as it happened, you ever experience God's work
[time=1117] in your life question for you this morning?
[time=1120] I'd like you to think about it.
[time=1121] Have you ever experienced God's work in you and looked back and seen that it never would have happened if he hadn't brought you to, if he hadn't brought me to LA for spring break in 1983,
[time=1138] if he hadn't brought Ruth to work in a field
[time=1144] of a guy named Boaz.
[time=1150] I'm gonna suggest to each of you this morning that there are times in life when a force, a force far greater than your most determined efforts or mine comes into play.
[time=1160] And when it does, when this force kicks in, lives are altered, direction gets redefined, difficult circumstances are redeemed.
[time=1170] And this force, my friends, has a name.
[time=1173] And the name of this force that I wanna introduce you to this morning is called Providence.
[time=1180] It's called the Providence of God.
[time=1183] And Webby, I want you to take us back if you would to week one in our study last Sunday.
[time=1190] There were some circumstances that needed redeemed in Ruth one.
[time=1196] There were some things going on there that you introduced.
[time=1199] I want for the folks who weren't here and for those who even were here.
[time=1202] Just give us a quick recap of chapter one and the narrative that we saw there as he began this redeeming work.
[time=1209] Ruth chapter one begins with a famine.
[time=1212] That's why everything else in the book happens the way it does.
[time=1215] A man named Balimalek and his wife Naomi have to go to Sojourn to stay for a little while in a nation to the southeast of Israel called Moab.
[time=1225] Naomi and Balimalek have two sons, those two sons, and Balimalek die while they're Sojourning and Moab.
[time=1233] They have taken two Moabytes as their wives to Moab by Tesses.
[time=1238] And then Naomi gets word in chapter one verse six that the Lord has visited his people and given them bread.
[time=1245] And then the trajectory is reversed.
[time=1248] Naomi begins to head back to Judah with Ruth in tow.
[time=1253] This Moab is who has attached herself who clings to Naomi and to Naomi's God.
[time=1258] And Ruth one ends with harvest.
[time=1261] It begins with famine, but it ends with harvest.
[time=1264] So I see redemption even beginning to spill out even in Ruth chapter one.
[time=1269] - Steve introduced us last week in our study of chapter one to an overview statement.
[time=1274] I know many of you wrote it down.
[time=1275] If you didn't write it down, write it down this morning.
[time=1278] I'm gonna show it to you right here, very important.
[time=1279] It'll serve, this statement will serve as a backdrop for our study over the next several weeks and it'll certainly play into our study this morning.
[time=1287] The statement goes like this, every good thing.
[time=1289] Actually, I would say Steve and I together have talked about this.
[time=1292] I would probably, we would rewrite this and we would say everything.
[time=1295] Everything, did you catch that?
[time=1298] Not just every good, but everything in our lives flows from God's good hand.
[time=1306] A hand that sovereignly and providentially works redemption for his people.
[time=1312] The statement reminds you and it reminds me that in his dealings with Ruth and Naomi and in his dealings with me in 1983 and in his dealings with you today, God's good hand is sovereignly and providentially committed to working redemption in your life and circumstance, sovereignty.
[time=1336] Tell them what you said last week.
[time=1337] This is the definition of sovereignty, don't miss this.
[time=1341] - We thought it was important to have working definitions of these words that we're using.
[time=1345] In sovereignty, we defined last week as God having absolute rule and control over his creation as king, remember a limalek that went to Sojourn in Moab, his name actually means God is my king.
[time=1359] A little interesting detail there.
[time=1360] Total control and determination over all that happens.
[time=1364] And so what Kelly just said, everything in our lives, this is a very strong statement from a very strong God who is in control over all things.
[time=1373] Nothing happens by accident.
[time=1377] Nothing in our lives happens by accident either.
[time=1380] So I'm encouraged to know that, Kelly, that we can serve a God like that and sing to a God like that who has all things in his hands.
[time=1388] And so if that's sovereignty, watch this.
[time=1390] Now we come to providence back to our working overview statement.
[time=1395] He's working sovereignly and providentially.
[time=1397] If sovereignty is God's supreme power and ultimate control over all, all right?
[time=1406] Providence is that which God lovingly does or allows along the way to move us toward his ultimate end.
[time=1415] Watch this, sovereignty, my friends, is, think of it this way, the sovereignty of God is his total ruling control.
[time=1423] It's A to what?
[time=1427] Z, it's his control over the whole thing.
[time=1433] Providence is what he lovingly does.
[time=1436] It's a very personal word because it's how he enters in.
[time=1440] It's what he does or allows along the way to move you from B to C.
[time=1449] F to G, S to T, you with me?
[time=1455] It's his involvement in your life to lovingly move you down this sovereign path through his providential involvement.
[time=1464] So that, well, I'll get to that.
[time=1466] How's that sound to you?
[time=1468] Sounds great.
[time=1469] Yeah.
[time=1469] Romans 8, God causes all things to work together for good
[time=1475] to those whom he's called according to his purpose.
[time=1476] So sovereignty and providence are friends and they work together.
[time=1480] And distinction from other world religions where I may not ever know what God has for me.
[time=1485] But the God of the Bible, as Rod said very beautifully, is intensely personal and he's intensely personally loves his people as he works out redemption for them.
[time=1494] Which is exactly where it's going.
[time=1495] Go back to our overview statement.
[time=1497] I hope you've got it written down.
[time=1499] Every good thing or everything in our lives flows from God's good hand, a hand that sovereignly and providentially works, say the word out loud.
[time=1507] Everybody, now, redemption.
[time=1510] This is what God is about.
[time=1512] This is what he was about with Ruth and Naomi.
[time=1514] This is what he was about with me in 83.
[time=1515] This is what he's about with you today.
[time=1517] He wants to work.
[time=1519] He is going to work redemption in your circumstance.
[time=1523] What's the word redemption mean?
[time=1524] Write this down to deliver, to buy back.
[time=1526] It means to rescue, to deliver, to buy back.
[time=1530] He enters in providentially and he moves us down this sovereign path to rescue us.
[time=1537] Sovereignty, providence, redemption.
[time=1541] We're about to see all three come together in Ruth 2.
[time=1546] Let me pray as we jump in.
[time=1548] Would you join me in a word of prayer?
[time=1550] And with your heads bowed, I'm going to just read to you.
[time=1552] Just listen.
[time=1553] Heads bowed, eyes closed.
[time=1555] Just listen to what it says in Ruth 2.3.
[time=1557] So Ruth went out to gather grain, it says, behind the harvesters.
[time=1562] And as it happened, and as it happened, she found herself working in a field that belonged to Boas.
[time=1570] The providence of God.
[time=1572] Let me ask you as we pray this morning.
[time=1574] And I mean this, I'm asking you honestly.
[time=1576] Where is God?
[time=1579] As you view it, as you see it.
[time=1581] And maybe there's some things he wants to teach you today.
[time=1583] But where is God in your heartache?
[time=1585] Does the Lord really intervene?
[time=1589] Our spiritual divine interventions.
[time=1594] Truly a reality.
[time=1596] Does he step into our trials?
[time=1598] Is God faithful when we're alone?
[time=1602] Does God remember us in our pain?
[time=1604] Naomi and Ruth are about to find out.
[time=1609] Oh God, give us guidance and insight this morning as we teach and proclaim your truth.
[time=1615] May every life in this room, every person watching on the web,
[time=1621] everybody hearing my voice here in whatever fashion through whatever medium in the days to come.
[time=1628] May every single person hear.
[time=1632] Understand any better and more meaningful way.
[time=1636] Your character and your love and your commitment to us
[time=1643] as we continue to unfold this great story of Naomi and Ruth and Boas.
[time=1649] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1652] Ruth chapter two, let's just jump in versus one to three.
[time=1656] Let me set some background for you.
[time=1657] Now Naomi, it says had a kinsman of her husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of a limulek, whose name was Boas.
[time=1667] And Ruth, the Moabite Tess, said to Naomi, please Naomi, let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after one in whose sight I may find favor.
[time=1681] And she Naomi said to her Ruth, go my daughter.
[time=1685] And so she departed and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boas who was of the family of a limulek, Boas who was of the family of a limulek.
[time=1702] So here's the young widow Ruth alone, utterly absolutely alone, trying to care for her widowed mother-in-law Naomi.
[time=1711] They've made their way back to Judah, settled there in Bethlehem.
[time=1714] Now Ruth finds herself in a land and among a people that were clearly not her own, so much, so not her own.
[time=1723] I'll explain that to you in just a moment.
[time=1725] And here's how we're going to do this this morning.
[time=1727] As we make our way through the chapter this morning and next week, I'll show you how the chapter breaks down.
[time=1732] There are three sections that we'll find here in Luke, or excuse me, in Ruth chapter two.
[time=1737] But along with the sections that I want to point out on the outline, I want you to see some of the principles.
[time=1744] That's what I really want you to see is we make our way through, I want to show you some of the principles that just pop off the page as you make your way through the second chapter of this amazing story.
[time=1755] Principle after principle after principle that we need to see and understand and apply in many cases to our lives.
[time=1763] Here's principle number one for anybody in the room, and I think this is maybe most of us probably, for anybody in the room this morning who has been given by God
[time=1775] the responsibility and opportunity of making a contribution to a home or a family.
[time=1782] I'm not just talking to the breadwinner here, I'm talking to anybody in the room who's been given in any way the chance to make a contribution to a home or a family when in doubt work, when in doubt work, when in need, listen, act.
[time=1804] Whenever there's question, do something when in doubt work.
[time=1810] Here's a quick character study on Ruth.
[time=1812] You want to see into her character the first thing she decides upon their return to Bethlehem.
[time=1819] The first thing she does is offer to go and work.
[time=1823] They needed food and provisions to live.
[time=1827] Literally, they had to eat to live.
[time=1831] The journey had been long, go to a map some time, look it up from where they started to where they ended up, absolutely exhausting.
[time=1839] They needed food and provisions, and so she's going to go get a job.
[time=1843] She's going to go roll up her sleeves and do hard labor.
[time=1849] She says to Naomi, please let me go and work.
[time=1858] And she goes to the field, listen, gang, I doubt what she did had anything to do with what she majored in.
[time=1865] Really, I doubt what she did had anything to do with her major.
[time=1872] I bet you to a large degree what she did probably felt beneath her
[time=1879] to some degree, but she had a family and she had responsibility
[time=1887] and God had given her this opportunity and so she was going to work.
[time=1891] Please let me go and work.
[time=1895] The God-honoring quality of a worker, a servant's heart.
[time=1900] That's the heart that God honors.
[time=1902] Verse two, Ruth two, I want to give you some specific insight here
[time=1908] into what's going on in the culture.
[time=1910] And Ruth, the Moabite, said to Naomi, please let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after one in whose sight I may find favor.
[time=1921] And she said go, work.
[time=1922] So she departed and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers.
[time=1928] After the reapers.
[time=1931] This was actually a common practice during that time among the needy, among the widows, among the orphans and strangers.
[time=1939] You see the Mosaic law itself commanded that the harvest should not be reaped
[time=1945] or cut down all the way to the corners.
[time=1948] You have the field, picture the rectangle.
[time=1951] The whole middle part is to be gleaned, but according to God's law, they were to leave the corners alone.
[time=1958] Should not be reaped all the way to the corners,
[time=1964] nor were the gleanings to be picked up.
[time=1967] The gleanings were the leftover stocks of grain that would have fallen on the ground and gotten left behind after the cutting.
[time=1975] You see in God's very law, the corners and the gleanings were for the poor and the needy.
[time=1982] Did you know that?
[time=1984] Look at Leviticus.
[time=1985] Go ahead.
[time=1985] Turn your Bibles.
[time=1986] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus 19.
[time=1991] Look what God had said about the way the corners and the gleanings were to be dealt with.
[time=1998] This was his word to his people.
[time=2000] It says in 19-9, "Now when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very corners of your field,
[time=2010] nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest." There it is.
[time=2013] "Nor shall you glean your vineyard, nor shall you gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard.
[time=2019] You shall leave them for the needy and for the stranger.
[time=2024] I am the Lord your God." So this was God's law.
[time=2031] This was God's rule for the people of God, but but remember what Webby showed us last week at the very end of Judges?
[time=2044] Yeah, God had given his people his law, but the people in this day, in the day that Ruth
[time=2051] and Naomi find themselves, the people in this day couldn't care less about the law of God.
[time=2058] Remember, they had all turned to do what was right in their own eyes.
[time=2063] Last verse of Judges.
[time=2064] During the time of the Judges, when God's people had tossed aside, rejected the law,
[time=2070] and did whatever was right in their own eyes.
[time=2072] People in that day were not only looking out simply for themselves, they were taking advantage of others in need in order to do so.
[time=2081] And so Ruth, against all odds, Ruth, the Moabite,
[time=2087] heads to the fields to see if she can find a way to earn something, anything to care for Naomi.
[time=2094] And I just want to remind you right here that in Scripture, in God's economy, work, work is blessed. Work is rewarded. In God's world, initiative is honored.
[time=2108] Now, here in verses 3 to 7, here in Ruth 2, 3 to 7, we come to the first section
[time=2116] of our outline. If you want to write this down, I'd encourage you to do so.
[time=2118] I'm going to show you another principle here in just a moment, but let's look at this first
[time=2124] section. Boaz meets Ruth, chapter 2, verses 3 to 7. This thing starts to unfold and it is so interesting.
[time=2133] Now, behold, Boaz says in verse 4, "Came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers,
[time=2143] 'May the Lord be with you.' And they said to him, 'May the Lord bless you.'
[time=2149] And then Boaz said to his servant, 'Who was in charge of the reapers? Whose young woman
[time=2155] is this? There was Ruth.' And he says, 'Who's that?' And the servant says in verse 6 to Boaz,
[time=2165] 'She's the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab.'
[time=2171] And she said that Boaz's servant says to Boaz about the conversation the servant had had with Ruth.
[time=2180] She said, 'Let me please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.'
[time=2187] And he goes on talking to Boaz, 'Thus she came and has remained from the morning until now.'
[time=2195] She's a hard, diligent worker. She has been sitting in the house for a little while.
[time=2201] There must have been a lean-to over on the side. Boaz is seeing her sitting there, and the servants wanting to make sure Boaz knows she hasn't been sitting there long.
[time=2209] She's been out busting it, working. What a picture. We'll go back to verse 4.
[time=2219] Go back to verse 4. I love it says, 'Now Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers,
[time=2228] 'May the Lord be with you.' I love how this guy shows up on the scene. Did you catch it?
[time=2232] He greets the workers in the name of the Lord. I thought we were in a time where nobody cared
[time=2243] anymore about the Lord. And you know what? We are in a time. Ruth and Naomi were in the middle of a
[time=2252] time where the masses had been falling away, and they didn't care about the name of the Lord,
[time=2258] but this dude did. Because what you have in this dude is a faithful man. And he shows up,
[time=2268] and his faithfulness just starts to pour out of him, greeting in the name of the Lord in a culture that could care less, Boaz had remained faithful. Now watch carefully, and you'll begin to see the
[time=2282] force that we talked about earlier, this thing called providence. You'll begin to see the force coming together here. The name Boaz means, guess what? The name Boaz means in him is strength.
[time=2299] In him is strength. Poor Ruth and Naomi show up on their own in desperate need, and they happen
[time=2306] to meet a guy whose name means in him is strength. Most scholars agree that in light of Ruth 4-3,
[time=2317] Ruth 4-3, then he said to the closest relative Naomi, who has come back from the land of Moab,
[time=2326] has to sell the peace of land which belonged to our brother, this is Boaz, speaking,
[time=2333] it belongs to our brother, Elimalek. Wow. Most scholars agree that in light of Ruth 4-3,
[time=2340] it's highly likely that Boaz was Elimalek's brother. It's his brother. His name means in him
[time=2348] is strength. He's more than likely Boaz's brother, and passages such as First Chronicles 2 and Matthew
[time=2355] 1 and Luke 3 make it clear that he had also never been married.
[time=2359] This faithful guy whose name means in me is strength, who probably was Elimalek's brother,
[time=2368] was single, never been married. And oh yeah, don't forget Ruth 2-1 says he was a man of great wealth,
[time=2375] which in the language of the Old Testament would have meant that he was a man of great valor,
[time=2382] and dignity who had unusual means to obtain and protect his holdings. And the text says she just
[time=2392] happened to come to the field of Boaz. For those of you in the room this morning committed
[time=2403] to knowing and honoring and following God, let me help you this morning and I will have you raise your hands. I hope all of you are really interested in learning more and more as these days go by as
[time=2416] to what it means to really know and honor and follow God. For those of you willing to do that, I want to help you this morning by encouraging you to delete. We'll just start with three this
[time=2428] morning, three phrases from your vocabulary. Will you just write these three phrases down and will you just commit to not use them in the days to come? Here's number one, luck. I'll let you use it if
[time=2440] you're talking about Andrew, but other than that, that's about it. We want to delete the word luck
[time=2447] from your vocabulary. Raise your hand if you use the word luck. I'm raising my hand. I use it all
[time=2453] the time and I shouldn't. We just got what? Say it, lucky. Luck ran its course. Some people will say,
[time=2460] let's think about this. Fate, second phrase, I want you to delete from your vocabulary as
[time=2466] what would have it? We say it all the time as fate would have it. A lot of times it kind of
[time=2473] sneaks into chick flicks, but we won't go there. Luck and fate, and here's one destiny. I've heard
[time=2480] people say, I feel my destiny beginning to unfold. My friends, it's not luck. It's not fate. It's not
[time=2487] destiny. Here's principle number two for the morning. Never mistake the human notion of chance for the divine reality of what? Say it, providence. It's not luck. It's not fate. It's not destiny.
[time=2501] It's a loving God who does and or allows in your life and mind as he moves us down this sovereign
[time=2510] road toward the redemption that he wants to work in you. Psalm 139, 1 to 6. Can I just read this to
[time=2519] you? I hope you'll turn there. I hope you'll write this down. Write down Psalm 139, 1 to 6.
[time=2526] Will you do that? Just write it down. Psalm 139, 1 to 6. Here is a classic passage for you to look
[time=2533] at, for you to consider, for you to come back to tonight, tomorrow, and really begin to contemplate
[time=2539] the level at which God is really providentially and sovereignly involved in your life.
[time=2547] O Lord, David says, O Lord, you have searched me and known me. Providence has a lot to do with his
[time=2557] knowledge of you. You know when I sit down and when I rise up, choices, your volitional life is
[time=2566] something that he oversees. He knows your choices. When you sit down and when you rise up, you
[time=2574] understand my thoughts from afar. You scrutinize the word in the original language there would have
[time=2580] to do with real careful planning. Some of you are really good at that. Others of us aren't.
[time=2585] It says here that God carefully plans. He scrutinizes our path and my lying down
[time=2594] and is intimately, oh, I love this phrase. David says, you are God, you are intimately acquainted with all of my ways. Even before there is a word on my tongue, behold, O Lord, you know
[time=2609] it all for knowledge. There's for knowledge with God. Wherever you refer to it, I want to just say
[time=2618] it to you again. As we think about his providence this morning, remember my friends, there's nothing that ever slips by him. He's never been surprised by a single thing. There are no mistakes. Nothing
[time=2630] happens that catches him off guard. No, there's great foreknowledge in his providence.
[time=2636] I love verse five, you have enclosed me behind and before. Behind you and in front of you, he is.
[time=2648] He sees it all. He guides it all. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. It is too high. I cannot
[time=2654] attain to it. The providence of God blows David away, but make no mistake, my friends. You're God in mine. If you know him, he is involved. He is at work. God's not removed. Timing and place
[time=2667] are up to him. True, but make no mistake. God's personally engaged and it's not black cats,
[time=2674] ground hogs, or fairy dust. Amen? It's called providence. It is called the providence of God. Next,
[time=2683] Boaz protects Ruth. Next, Boaz protects Ruth. Chapter two, verse eight, then Boaz says to Ruth,
[time=2691] listen carefully. I love this interaction. Listen carefully, Ruth, my daughter. Do not go to glean
[time=2697] in another field. Furthermore, do not go on from this one, but stay here with my mates.
[time=2704] Let your eyes be on the field which they reap. And go after them. Indeed, I have commanded the servants not to touch you. When you are thirsty, go to the water jars and drink from what the
[time=2716] servants draw. And she fell on her face, bowing to the ground and said to him, why have I found favor in your sight that you should take notice of me since I am a Moabite, a foreigner.
[time=2730] Boaz replied to her, all that you have done for your mother-in-law. After the death of your husband has been fully reported to me. Interesting. And how you left your father and your mother in
[time=2741] the land of your birth and came to a people that you did not previously know. May the Lord reward
[time=2747] your work and your wages be full from the Lord, God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to
[time=2753] seek refuge. Then she said, I have found favor in your sight, my Lord, for you have comforted me
[time=2759] and indeed have spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not like one of your maidservants. No,
[time=2765] she wasn't. She was from Moab. Listen, we're going to close with this. She was from Moab. The band can
[time=2773] come on up. If you guys are around, I want the room to hear this. Moab had been brutal
[time=2779] to the people of Israel when they were released from Egypt. The scriptures are replete with the
[time=2787] story of the people of Israel trying to get to the Promised Land and Moab. They come out with all
[time=2793] their hatred and all their strife. They even pronounce curses on them and it doesn't work. And God
[time=2800] goes before the Israelites and he guards them from the Moabites and it so disturbs God and in
[time=2806] Deuteronomy, God says, you know what? By the way, I can't stand the Moabites. He says in Deuteronomy 23.
[time=2812] In fact, I don't want Moabites or Ammonites to ever even come into the house of God.
[time=2817] For ten generations, he says, they're that bad. And he says, they didn't come to give you
[time=2825] people of Israel, God saying, they didn't even come to give you bread and water.
[time=2829] And here's Boaz with a Moabite showing the other side of God. Boaz, a Christ type in the story,
[time=2844] coming to a Moabite woman and giving her bread and what? And water. And I wonder, my friends,
[time=2853] I wonder if you have any Moabites in your life. I wonder if you have somebody in your world
[time=2862] who's not like you, who has a sort of past who comes from bad ancestry, who is difficult to be
[time=2871] around, who's unlovely, who tries your patience, who everybody in your world would expect you to be rude to or unkind to, or that best just avoid. I wonder if there's a Moabite in your world
[time=2885] who could use a little bread and water from you. Some kindness because the scriptures say
[time=2894] that it's the kindness of God and His people that leads to what? Repentance, redemption.
[time=2907] Let's praise and worship our good and gracious and merciful God together.
[time=2937] You were near, though I was distant, disillusioned, I was lost and insecure, still mercy for
[time=2957] my attention. You were waiting at the door and I let you in.
[time=2982] Trading your life for my offenses, for my redemption, you carried over the blame,
[time=2996] breaking the curse, and our condition, perfection to God.
[time=3010] When only that could make a way, you gave your life in a beautiful exchange.
[time=3040] My prayer and your grace, my life I gather, there is nothing that could save us
[time=3060] my whole way, my holy desire, soul and worship, is to love you just us.
[time=3073] When only that could make a way,
[time=3091] you gave your life in a beautiful exchange,
[time=3104] when only that could break the same, you gave, you gave your life in a beautiful exchange.
[time=3132] Holy, are you God? Holy is your name, with everything I've got, my heart will sing, how I love you.
[time=3295] Me for the throne of God above, I have a strong man, perfectly a great high priest whose name is love,
[time=3310] whoever lives and plays for me. My name is Raven on his hands, my name is Rhett and on his heart,
[time=3325] I know that a while in him he stands, no tongue can bend me this deep heart, no tongue can bend me this deep heart.
[time=3341] The Satan tempts me to despair, with me I'm the Lord with him, but what I love against him
[time=3356] Me to end of all my sin, because the sinless Savior died, my sinful soul is counted free,
[time=3370] For God the just is satisfied, to live on him in the heart of me, to live on him in the heart of me.
[time=3388] Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise One is in Son of God.
[time=3408] He holds him there, the risen lamb, my perfect spotless righteousness.
[time=3418] The great unchangile who I am, the king of glory and the rich, one with himself, I cannot die.
[time=3432] My soul is purchased by his blood, my life is here, with Christ on hand, with Christ my Savior,
[time=3445] and my God, hallelujah, hallelujah, praise One, risen Son of God.
