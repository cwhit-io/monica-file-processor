[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] [MUSIC - 5 seconds]
[time=42] One last time, sing it out, church.
[time=46] [MUSIC - 239 seconds]
[time=290] (audience applauds)
[time=299] [MUSIC - 828 seconds]
[time=1133] - We just lift him up this morning and give him praise.
[time=1136] (audience applauding)
[time=1145] You got your Bibles and you open them up to Ruth chapter three.
[time=1149] We've just set the stage.
[time=1150] Boaz and all of his kindness has now provided in significant ways for Ruth and for Naomi.
[time=1159] And for the two of them, the dark lonely days of heartache and struggle seem to be over as we see in Boaz and his actions, the love of Christ, the redeeming love of Christ, exemplified through this Christ type, Boaz.
[time=1178] This man of kindness, this man of goodness and integrity and character.
[time=1182] And I know many of you this week because I heard from the people you contacted.
[time=1187] I really did.
[time=1188] I know that many of you took me up on the assignment I gave you to track down and find somebody in your life who had been a Boaz to you, who had exercised kindness and generosity and grace to you when you didn't deserve it and your willingness to write them notes, to text them, to call them, to email them, to have hallway conversations with them was much appreciated.
[time=1211] And if you didn't get a chance to do it this week, I hope you'll do it this next week.
[time=1215] What a tremendous picture of goodness and grace and kindness Boaz was to Ruth and to Naomi.
[time=1221] Steve Webster gave you an overview statement in week one of our study.
[time=1226] And I wanna take you back to that overview statement.
[time=1229] Here we are several weeks down the road.
[time=1232] I want you to see, he told you on that Sunday morning in week one that this statement would kind of be exemplary of what we would discover and what we would see as the story unfolds.
[time=1244] It says in our overview statement of the book of Ruth, every good thing, Steve and I would really edit that today.
[time=1249] If we were writing this again, we would take the word good out.
[time=1253] Because every good thing and every hard thing, my friends,
[time=1260] every good thing and every difficult thing in your life flows from God's good hand.
[time=1268] A hand that sovereignly God being an absolute utter control of your life from A to Z.
[time=1275] It is the whole picture of your existence and his absolute control over it all.
[time=1281] A hand that sovereignly and providentially, providence, again, him injecting himself into your life and mind and moving you from B to C, moving you from L to M, moving you down this road of his sovereign plan for your life.
[time=1298] It is a hand, it is a good hand that sovereignly and providentially works what, say the word, redemption.
[time=1306] God is always committed to working redemption, rescue, rebuilding, making new that which is broken.
[time=1316] It's what God has always done.
[time=1318] It's what God is doing today.
[time=1320] It's what he will always, always be about him.
[time=1323] That is exactly, I love how Steve set us up for that.
[time=1327] And it is exactly, think about it, what we've seen.
[time=1331] It's what we've watched transpire so far.
[time=1334] The sovereign, providential love of God, working to achieve rescue and redemption for Naomi and Ruth.
[time=1340] But, but not just for Naomi and Ruth.
[time=1349] For as is often the case with God and the unfolding narrative of Scripture, there's more to the story.
[time=1357] There's more going on here than him working redemption for Naomi and Ruth.
[time=1364] I know they've just been provided with basically a year's worth when you added it all up, of grain, their physical needs have now been met.
[time=1375] God has through Boaz in a significant way come in and redemptively blessed them.
[time=1381] But the truth is, the truth is you.
[time=1384] You are a part of this story as well.
[time=1391] The truth is, as God sovereignly deals with two hurting widows and a good godly land owner and a barley harvest more than 3000 years ago, he God had his eye on you.
[time=1406] He knew you would need rescued.
[time=1411] He knew I would need desperately to be redeemed.
[time=1416] And he uses these individuals, he does.
[time=1418] He uses these individuals and their story to bring redemption to you and to me and our story.
[time=1426] And as this story unfolds here in chapter three, this is where it gets really, really interesting.
[time=1432] It's about to get really exciting.
[time=1434] It gets a little romantic, it's very gutsy, it's nerve-wracking, it's heart-warming.
[time=1439] And it is absolutely and utterly redemptive.
[time=1444] Redemptive on a scale way beyond the events of this eighth book of the Old Testament.
[time=1449] What you're about to read and see my friends transpire, reaches on into not only the future of Boaz and Ruth, but into the eternity, the eternity of mankind.
[time=1461] It reaches into your eternity.
[time=1463] It reaches into mine.
[time=1466] Ruth three, 18 verses start to finish.
[time=1470] And here's how we'll do this today.
[time=1471] I'm gonna read and explain.
[time=1475] I'll read a little and then stop and do my best to explain it.
[time=1478] And as we go, I'll give you some principles to take note of.
[time=1481] I'll give you some truth, hopefully, to take home.
[time=1483] You are about to witness a marriage proposal.
[time=1487] Just got the ladies in the room attention, I know that.
[time=1490] You're about to witness a marriage proposal, suggested by Naomi in verses one through five, executed, carried out by Ruth in verses six to nine, agreed to by Boaz in verses 10 to 18, agreed to with an asterisk that's gonna absolutely blow your mind and frustrate you.
[time=1511] You will leave this morning, hopefully bless, but I promise you you will leave this morning frustrated as well.
[time=1518] It's gonna bring us back next week to see how this thing continues to unfold.
[time=1521] So here we go.
[time=1522] A marriage proposal suggested by Naomi.
[time=1526] Look with me at Ruth chapter three verses one to five and it says there, "Then Naomi, her mother-in-law said to her "to Ruth, 'My daughter, shall I not seek security for you "that it may be well with you.'" Now he's not Boaz, our kinsmen, our kinsmen redeemer, our closest relative with whose maids you were, with whose maids you've been working, in other words.
[time=1549] Behold Ruth, he winnows barley at the threshing floor tonight.
[time=1554] Wash yourself therefore and anoint yourself
[time=1560] and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing floor, but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
[time=1571] It shall be when he lies down that you shall notice the place where he lies and you shall go and uncover his feet and lie down there.
[time=1584] I told you they should make a movie.
[time=1588] Then he will tell you the text says, then he will tell you what you shall do.
[time=1594] And then Ruth, having heard all of that, says to Naomi,
[time=1600] you're nuts.
[time=1602] No, look what she says.
[time=1606] Young ladies, especially in the room, take note of what she says to the older woman who gives her direction.
[time=1614] All that you say, what?
[time=1617] I will do.
[time=1618] All that you say, I will do.
[time=1622] All right, first off, it's important to note, let's go back to the beginning of that section there.
[time=1627] It's important to note there in verse one when it says, "My daughter shall I not seek security for you." That phrase there's security in the Hebrew language itself and in the context of the story and the culture, what she's talking about there is marriage.
[time=1640] She has seen God provide for Ruth on the physical front.
[time=1644] She has seen God in miraculous redeeming ways, bring their situation, their personal and their physical situation to a much better place.
[time=1652] And now Naomi looks to the future, she realizes a probably late 20s, early 30s gal
[time=1661] and that culture would wanna be married.
[time=1663] You'd want that gal to be able to experience that, go forward with that, have a family, have a lineage.
[time=1670] And so she says that it may be well with you, shall I not seek security for you?
[time=1678] So I have a plan.
[time=1680] She says in verse three, wash yourself.
[time=1683] You wanna make note of that.
[time=1685] She says to Ruth, wash yourself therefore and anoint, that's perfume, anoint yourself and put on your best clothes.
[time=1697] Now some great insights that you just pick up as you read through this and you think through this and you read some of the stuff that guys have written over the years, really insightful.
[time=1707] Here's what I believe that's saying.
[time=1710] What that's saying is this, Ruth finds herself still probably up into this point in a state of mourning.
[time=1719] Remember she lost her husband.
[time=1722] We don't know exactly how long ago that was.
[time=1725] We're not sure of the span of time but it is very easy to understand and very clear for us to project that she would have in Moab and then on the journey back and now they're back in Bethlehem and she's in a state of mourning.
[time=1737] A state of mourning in that culture for a woman in her situation would have been literally for the most part she would not have kept herself.
[time=1749] She wouldn't have, she wouldn't have cleaned herself.
[time=1754] She wouldn't have done her hair.
[time=1756] She wouldn't have put on her best clothes.
[time=1759] She wouldn't have in any way done anything to make herself look anything other than broken, tired, sad in mourning, hurting over the loss of her husband.
[time=1774] And so here's the point I wanna make here.
[time=1777] So go back to when Boass first sees her.
[time=1781] Go back to when Boass comes to the field and says, hey, see in your mind and mind when we read that a couple of weeks ago, we think Boass comes into the field and goes, whoa, who's that?
[time=1796] You did, didn't you?
[time=1798] And I want you to understand she looked horrible.
[time=1802] I want you to understand that physically and outward wise.
[time=1807] There was nothing going on there that was attractive.
[time=1811] And again, it speaks to the heart and character of this man who even in the text we could tell was drawn to her, but what was he drawn to, young ladies?
[time=1824] Young ladies in the room, young men in the room what he was drawn to was her character.
[time=1832] So the way she worked was the way she was providing for her mother-in-law, it was her integrity.
[time=1839] It was what he had heard about her and her reputation.
[time=1843] This is what God has attention.
[time=1847] She hadn't washed and who knows how long.
[time=1851] It wasn't how she looked, it was who she was.
[time=1856] She says, all right, time for the mourning to stop.
[time=1859] Go take a shower, like a really good one, she probably said.
[time=1864] And get on a great dress and put on some perfume.
[time=1867] And we're gonna end this time of mourning and move on with life.
[time=1871] She says, go to the threshing floor, a flat indoor surface, a threshing floor.
[time=1876] This is where all the grain would be taken, all the harvest would be brought in.
[time=1880] It was a flat indoor surface.
[time=1881] There's a picture of it on the screen, you can look at one.
[time=1884] A flat indoor surface where the wheat would be stepped on and trampled and winnowed.
[time=1889] She said that Boaz was winnowing.
[time=1892] Winnowing is the separating out of the grain.
[time=1895] This was hard work, this took a long time.
[time=1898] This was painstaking.
[time=1899] It was something that those who own these fields and made a living off their crops would give great effort and time and attention to.
[time=1907] The threshing floor is where all this work would occur.
[time=1911] And the owner of the land and his crew, his workers, his servants, they would work from sun up to sundown.
[time=1919] Oftentimes it would take days and days and days.
[time=1923] But at the end of it all, they would have their harvest.
[time=1926] At the end of it all, they would have their piles, their mountains of grain.
[time=1931] At the end of it all, there would be great celebration.
[time=1934] And so she says to go to the threshing floor and uncover his feet and lie down, she says, to Ruth,
[time=1947] next to his feet.
[time=1948] So all dressed up, think about this.
[time=1951] Go ahead and just paint this picture in your mind.
[time=1954] All dressed up, perfumed up, she's to wait until he's asleep, approach him, this wealthy older land owner.
[time=1964] Remember Boaz, remember this, another little note to make.
[time=1967] Boaz was a limalex brother.
[time=1971] A limalex was Naomi's husband.
[time=1976] Boaz isn't a peer.
[time=1980] She's not a dude, he's not a dude in like Ruth's circle.
[time=1986] He's probably 50-ish, which isn't old by any stretch.
[time=1994] I just walked right into that.
[time=1996] I got to get used to this.
[time=1998] He's probably 50-55.
[time=2000] She's probably 28-32.
[time=2004] He's a wealthy, respected land owner in his 50s
[time=2010] who's asleep in the threshing floor next to his grain after a long day.
[time=2015] Wow, long day's work.
[time=2019] And she says, go down there and uncover his feet in the text.
[time=2022] It says feet literally in the Hebrew.
[time=2024] That would mean lower legs.
[time=2027] That's what it means, lower legs.
[time=2031] And then lay down next to him down next to his lower legs
[time=2037] and wait.
[time=2039] Naomi says, then he will tell you what to do.
[time=2044] He'll play his hand when he realizes you're laying next to his legs in the middle of the night in a dark room on the threshing floor.
[time=2059] And I'm reading this this week.
[time=2060] And I'm thinking, man, think about that.
[time=2063] What's he going to-- like, what would he say?
[time=2066] What would you do?
[time=2067] What would his response be?
[time=2069] I mean, what would be going through his head?
[time=2071] What's going through her head?
[time=2073] And she says to Naomi, OK, I'm going to go and do this.
[time=2076] Culturally, I want you to think about this.
[time=2079] Culturally, I want you to understand this is really true.
[time=2082] I'm being very accurate.
[time=2083] I'm not making stuff up.
[time=2084] This is what could have happened very realistically.
[time=2088] Culturally, he could have accused her of improper, even immoral behavior, trying to somehow, what, seduce her way out of poverty and into the good graces of a wealthy man who had really, at the end of the day, just shown her general kindness.
[time=2103] Could have been his response.
[time=2109] Since she had no new marriage contract in effect, she was legally still the wife of Naomi's son.
[time=2117] And so, maybe Boaz would accuse her of attempted adultery.
[time=2121] What's he going to say?
[time=2125] What would a man in that situation do?
[time=2127] Or somebody noted this, and I thought it was worth repeating.
[time=2132] Honestly, what if Boaz wasn't really a godly man at all?
[time=2139] You ever been fooled by somebody you thought?
[time=2142] Was godly, what if Boaz's kindness had been dark and self-serving all along?
[time=2148] And what if alone in the night, in the privacy of the threshing floor, is exactly where this old guy wanted her?
[time=2157] How all this stuff?
[time=2164] Maybe running through this young lady's mind.
[time=2166] And she's hearing Naomi lay this thing out.
[time=2169] But Ruth says in verse five, look at verse five.
[time=2172] What does she say?
[time=2173] She says to Naomi, all that you say I will do.
[time=2179] Young ladies, young ladies in the room, older women,
[time=2185] listen, a deep, strong trust in a godly, honest, older woman
[time=2194] led this young lady to exemplify bold, bold, and courageous
[time=2204] obedience.
[time=2207] And if ever there was a day in your world and mine, if ever there was a time in all my 50 years when young women in a culture needed to be able to experience bold and courageous obedience,
[time=2227] it's today.
[time=2228] And oh how I hope, and oh how I pray that every young lady in this room has an older woman
[time=2238] that you could turn to.
[time=2239] An older woman who's willing to speak truth and guidance and love and wisdom into your life, even times when the wisdom and the truth and the guidance might actually scare you to death, go where?
[time=2253] Do what?
[time=2256] But no, she places her trust and she places her faith in the words of an older woman, a woman who she trusted, a woman who she admired, listened back a couple chapters ago.
[time=2268] She said she left her home and her gods.
[time=2272] And she said to Naomi, I'm going to go where you go.
[time=2276] I'm going to serve your gods.
[time=2278] I'm going to be with your people, so here we are.
[time=2281] Some time has gone by.
[time=2283] Naomi sort of rubbed off on her.
[time=2285] She respects her.
[time=2286] She's going to do what she says.
[time=2288] Oh, older women in the room, please, please be willing
[time=2294] to invest in a younger woman.
[time=2296] Formally, officially, we could help set you up in a mentoring relationship.
[time=2301] Talk to us, we can do that.
[time=2302] But even just relationally in your own world, older women, would you always be looking for those who are coming behind you?
[time=2309] They need bold and courageous obedience today.
[time=2313] And you may be the exact thing that God has in mind.
[time=2317] All right, here we go.
[time=2320] Ruth carries out the proposal.
[time=2322] Deep breath, here we go, you're ready?
[time=2324] Verse six, so she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her.
[time=2330] When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain.
[time=2340] So he's away from, that's important, because now he's away from everybody and everything.
[time=2345] And she came secretly and uncovered his lower legs, his feet, and laid down.
[time=2353] It happened in the middle of the night that the man was startled, no kidding, and bent forward.
[time=2360] He sits up, can you see it?
[time=2361] He sits up, he bends forward.
[time=2363] And it's pitch dark, and behold, a woman is lying at his feet.
[time=2367] And he said, who are you?
[time=2370] And I love this.
[time=2371] She answered, I am Ruth, you're made.
[time=2374] I am Ruth, you're made.
[time=2375] So spread your covering over your made for you
[time=2381] are a kinsman redeemer, for you are my closest relative.
[time=2389] All right, let's start with that last statement.
[time=2392] And then in nine, and then we're going to kind of work our way back up through that section.
[time=2396] Spread your covering over your made.
[time=2399] Listen, it's important to note, this wasn't Ruth saying, lift up the blanket and scoot over.
[time=2406] I want to say that right here at the beginning.
[time=2409] I actually read some commentators this week who sort of try to propose that that's exactly what she was doing.
[time=2416] I don't believe that that's what she was doing.
[time=2419] I don't believe that's what that meant.
[time=2420] I don't believe that's what transpired at all, the character and the integrity of Boaz as experienced over the first two chapters of this book.
[time=2430] The actually the character and integrity of this young lady experienced and seen over the flow of these first two chapters would in no way suggest that that's what she was saying.
[time=2441] So I realized as I'm reading this chapter to you that we're moving in our study from G to PG-13 maybe.
[time=2450] But we're not going, we're not going any further than that.
[time=2453] You with me?
[time=2456] Spread your covering over your made.
[time=2458] In the Mosaic Law and the custom of the day, this cloak covering action, this garment cloak, blanket covering action, put it over me.
[time=2469] Let me come in under would be a couple of things.
[time=2473] Number one, it would be a symbolic action.
[time=2475] It was a pledge, a commitment on the part of the young man to marry the woman.
[time=2481] So this was certainly within an absolutely connected to the cultural custom of the day.
[time=2488] And it was her communicating to Boaz, her openness and her receptivity to him covering her with his garment.
[time=2499] But it was also much deeper than that.
[time=2501] It is also yet another example in the book of Ruth, of Boaz being shown to be this Christ type symbol.
[time=2513] It's another example here in the book of Ruth for you and I to see this love, this redeeming care of God, this redeeming love of the Lord exemplified through this man, this Christ type Boaz.
[time=2525] Here's what I want you to see.
[time=2526] Go back to chapter two, verse 12.
[time=2531] Here Boaz is just expressing blessing earlier on Ruth.
[time=2537] May the Lord reward your work.
[time=2541] May your wages, he says to her, be full from the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge.
[time=2552] Then go to chapter three, verse nine.
[time=2554] Here's what I want you to see.
[time=2555] He said in the middle of the night on the threshing floor, who is it?
[time=2559] Who are you?
[time=2560] And she answered, I'm Ruth, you're made.
[time=2562] So spread your covering.
[time=2567] Listen, church, that word covering, 3-9, the word the phrase wings in 2-12, same Hebrew phrase.
[time=2578] It's the same thing.
[time=2580] She's asking.
[time=2583] She's asking for what she knows God promised he would bring.
[time=2589] A covering, protection, salvation, redemption, rescue.
[time=2597] And this is a theme we see all through the scriptures.
[time=2600] Go back.
[time=2600] I want to hear your pages turning.
[time=2602] Come on, come with me, go to Exodus.
[time=2604] Everybody, go to Exodus 19.
[time=2607] Real quick, I want you just to see this theme.
[time=2609] Go to Exodus 19.4.
[time=2613] Exodus 19.4, you yourselves, God speaking to the people of Israel, I want you to see and understand this theme throughout the pages of scripture.
[time=2620] It's exactly what's going on here between Ruth and Boas.
[time=2625] You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians.
[time=2628] God says in verse 4 of Exodus 19.
[time=2631] And how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself in the Hebrew, that would bring eagles' coverings.
[time=2640] Deuteronomy 32.
[time=2642] Go there, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus number.
[time=2644] Go to Deuteronomy 32, 11.
[time=2650] Like an eagle that stirs up its nest, that hovers over its young, he spread his covering, he spread his wings and caught them and carried them on his pinions.
[time=2663] Go to Psalm 17.
[time=2667] Go to the book of Psalms and look at chapter 17, verse 8, it says in Psalm 17, 8, it says, keep me.
[time=2673] David's cry, David's prayer to God.
[time=2676] He says, keep me as the apple of your eye.
[time=2679] Hide me in the covering.
[time=2681] Hide me in the shadow of your wings.
[time=2684] It says in Psalm 36, Psalm 36, seven.
[time=2688] It says right there in Psalm 36, seven, how precious is your loving kindness, oh God?
[time=2695] And the children of men take refuge in the shadow of your covering, in the shadow of your wings.
[time=2702] And then it says in 57, go back a few pages to 57 one, Psalm 57 one, be gracious to me, oh God, be gracious to me, for my soul takes refuge in you and in the shadow of your covering, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge.
[time=2722] And then we come to roof three.
[time=2725] And then you come to roof three, roof three nine, and she says to him, so spread your wings, so spread your covering over your maid, for you are a close relative.
[time=2741] Kinsman redeemers provided refuge, they provided rescue, Boaz portrayed again as a Christ type.
[time=2748] What a powerful picture.
[time=2750] It says in verse seven, I think it's important that we address this.
[time=2754] It says in verse seven, when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was married, he went to lie down.
[time=2763] Mary, okay, listen, again, this is a very cultural setting, it's a very cultural picture, they would in that day, they would go and work very, very hard, they would work very long hours, oftentimes the owner of that land would also be a man who would make and produce wine and they would oftentimes have a glass or two of wine during or after their meal.
[time=2787] It says that he was Mary, it's important that you know, the word Mary in this context is not the Hebrew word for sloppy drunk, it's not what it's saying, it's not what it's communicating, it's not the picture, I want you younger kids to have in your mind, this is what they did, they would eat, they would have a glass of wine, the word Mary means relaxed, it means satisfied after a long day on the threshing floor, he ate, he drank, and he went to sleep.
[time=2814] So, where's this going, Ruth three, here we go, Boas responds, Ruth three, 10 to 11, she's done all this, she has said all this, now comes the answer that we've all been waiting for, then he says to her, "May you be blessed of the Lord, "my daughter, you have shown your last kindness "to be better than the first." By not going, he just pours his heart out here, it's pretty cool actually, you have shown your last kindness to be better than the first, by not going after young men, whether poor or rich, now my daughter do not fear, 'cause I bet she was, I bet she was, and he says don't fear, I will do, he loses his mind here personally I think, but he says I will do whatever you ask.
[time=2868] For all my people in this city, this is so cool, for all my people in this city know that you are a woman of excellence, if there's any doubt in your mind that what she was doing on that threshing floor was in some way immoral or promiscuous, understand this, one of the most moral, godly guys we've seen in a long time in the period of the judges just called her the one phrase that was used for the highest of integrity.
[time=2893] When he says there, he calls her a woman of excellence, he's speaking to the absolute strength of her character and her integrity, so he makes no accusations, there's no taking advantage of her, whatever Ruth or Naomi might have sensed in terms of his, I don't know, scent signals, they were right on, and he responds with absolute class and dignity, question for you, have you ever covered all your bases?
[time=2920] I can ask this of the men, in the room I could ask this of the women, in the room, here's Boaz, he just worked hard all day, he works hard all day, he has his meal and he just goes to bed, he even goes to bed over at the end where there's nobody around, he's minding his own business, he's doing what he's supposed to do, have you ever covered all your bases?
[time=2946] Wanting to live in integrity, and somehow, in the midst of covering all your bases, have you ever had a temptation, still get through?
[time=2959] Have you ever been woken up in the middle of the night?
[time=2962] And there it is, what do you do?
[time=2968] What a great picture, for you and for me, when it comes to those moments, when all of a sudden, there's nobody around, and there's nobody watching, and you can do whatever you want to do.
[time=2987] And you didn't go out looking for it, and sometimes when you don't go out looking for it, sometimes when you're trying to do the right thing, and the temptation still comes, sometimes you say, and sometimes I say, well you know what I tried, you know, I did my part.
[time=3003] And Boaz, wow, he just in my mind and in my heart,
[time=3009] as I study this guy, and as I watch this story unfold, I just keep getting more and more amazed, at the level at which he conducts himself.
[time=3020] The first kindness she shows is to Naomi.
[time=3023] This last kindness is that she finds him desirable, and he is blown away by her willingness and her readiness to move in that direction.
[time=3034] Here you go, watch, now it gets interesting.
[time=3036] You thought that was interesting.
[time=3037] This is where the drama just gets even better.
[time=3040] Ruth 3 verse 12, we'll pick it up there.
[time=3044] Now, it is true, he says to her, all their feelings are out in the open now, they know what's gonna, they know where this thing's going, but he says now it's true, I am a close relative.
[time=3056] However, there is a relative closer than I.
[time=3061] What are you talking about?
[time=3067] Naomi said, I know Naomi said, and I thought, and he says, I know you thought.
[time=3073] He says, but the truth of the matter is, I'm not your kinsman, redeemer.
[time=3079] There's actually a guy in town who is truly your closest relative.
[time=3085] Remain, he says to her, remain.
[time=3090] He's just like, settle down, sit tight.
[time=3092] Remain this night, and when morning comes, if he will redeem you, good, let him redeem you.
[time=3102] In other words, if this closest relative wants to have you, that's how God designed it, and I'm gonna be okay with it, but if he does not wish to redeem you, then I will redeem you as the Lord lives.
[time=3114] Lie down and lie down next to my feet until morning.
[time=3119] So she laid at his feet until morning, and rose before one could recognize another, he gets her up in the early morning hours, is caring about her reputation, doesn't want there to be any gossip.
[time=3132] But it not be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.
[time=3136] Again, he said, give me the cloak.
[time=3138] He has covered her with the cloak.
[time=3141] Now he takes the cloak back, give me the cloak that is on you and hold it.
[time=3145] So she held it, and he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her.
[time=3150] Then she went into the city.
[time=3152] When she came to her mother-in-law, Naomi, she said, Naomi says to her, how'd it go?
[time=3157] How'd it go, my daughter?
[time=3158] And she told her all that the men had done for her.
[time=3161] She said, these six measures of barley he gave to me for he said, do not go to your mother-in-law empty-handed.
[time=3167] He's still thinking about Naomi.
[time=3169] He's still trying to have as much character and integrity as he can, still trying to care for these gals.
[time=3175] And then Naomi says to Ruth, wait, my daughter, until you know how the matter turns out, for the man will not rest until he has settled it today.
[time=3190] Now I said earlier that this story of redemption wasn't just about Naomi and Ruth.
[time=3196] Remember, I told you that it was about you as well.
[time=3200] I said, God had his eye on you, that the redemptive implications of this story move far beyond two widows and a kind landowner.
[time=3209] I told you just a few minutes ago, this story had spiritual, eternal ramifications, your eternity, and mine, while it does.
[time=3219] It does.
[time=3222] Come back next week.
[time=3225] But I'm gonna tell you this.
[time=3229] I told you last week, Boaz and Ruth, they get married.
[time=3234] It works it out.
[time=3237] It's incredible how he does it.
[time=3239] But listen, listen, Boaz and Ruth get married.
[time=3243] And they have a son, and because of that son, Obed.
[time=3248] The line and the lineage of Messiah was preserved.
[time=3255] Boaz and Ruth are like the great, great, great, great,
[time=3261] great, great, great grandparents of Jesus of Messiah.
[time=3271] Boaz and Ruth are in the line of Jesus Christ, your rescue, your rescuer and your redeemer.
[time=3281] Who by the way, I don't know if we said this last week,
[time=3287] but I gotta say it to you this week, who by the way, Jesus Christ was born where?
[time=3293] Say it.
[time=3295] And where was Naomi from?
[time=3301] Where did Naomi come back to?
[time=3302] Bethlehem.
[time=3305] And where did Ruth meet Boaz?
[time=3308] This city, gate, they keep the, it's Bethlehem.
[time=3313] And it all just gets wrapped together as God has his eye on you.
[time=3320] And as God provides for you a redeemer through his sovereign and providential hand, that's always good.
[time=3327] He was doing it then, he's doing it now.
[time=3329] It's absolutely amazing.
[time=3331] Can't wait to have you come back next week and we'll see together how this thing plays out.
[time=3336] Let me pray for us.
[time=3337] Father in heaven, we're grateful for your word.
[time=3339] We're thankful for the chance to look at it closely this morning so grateful for those who have led us in worship so thankful for the privilege that we have to be together as a family.
[time=3349] God, give us strength and courage as we live these truths out.
[time=3352] Oh God, may we be like Ruth.
[time=3354] May we have a bold and courageous obedience to do the scary and the challenging because it's right.
[time=3363] God, thank you for the picture that's been painted today of integrity and obedience and wisdom.
[time=3372] And may we, young and old, follow suit in all that you've given us to do.
[time=3377] In your son's name we pray.
[time=3379] [AMEN] [MUSIC - 66 seconds]
[time=3451] - Part of the sin.
[time=3452] [MUSIC - 62 seconds]
[time=3517] Sing that again.
[time=3518] [MUSIC]
[time=3522] One more time.
