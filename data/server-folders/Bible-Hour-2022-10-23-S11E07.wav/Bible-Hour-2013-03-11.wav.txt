[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] It seems like it's been a while since I've been with you in this setting.
[time=38] I look forward to these few minutes that we get most each and every week and it's good to be back with you.
[time=44] I wanna just talk to you if I can for a few minutes about a Sunday coming up.
[time=48] When you view this, most likely it's gonna be Palm Sunday, the 24th of March, and we just wanna remind you that the 31st of March this year is Resurrection Sunday, Easter is a time where so many people in our country and around the world celebrate, most of them, or a lot of them understanding its true meaning, but others just make their way to a church building on that Sunday and take part in the festivities and the celebration and we want you to know, I want you to know, those of you in our viewing audience, that we would love for you to come and be a part of the celebration that day.
[time=86] It goes way beyond festivities.
[time=89] It goes way beyond just a normal celebration.
[time=92] It is the most significant and it is the most important Sunday of them all.
[time=98] It is the great opportunity for those who know the Lord to celebrate the great gift of his son, the sacrifice of our Savior and the ultimate defeat of death.
[time=108] And so I hope you'll come, we're gonna be talking that morning about how Jesus is the bread of life.
[time=115] That's right, think about that.
[time=116] Jesus called himself and in the gospels, we see that he's referred to as the bread of life.
[time=122] And when you think about what you're hungry for, when you think about what you need for survival, when you think about those most basic instincts in you and me both, the idea of Jesus being the bread of life is something I can't wait to unpack with you and talk about and invite you to consider at an even deeper level.
[time=142] So you come, but let me also say this, why don't you bring somebody with you?
[time=146] Why don't you come at nine or 1045 and don't come alone?
[time=150] Bring your family, bring some friends, bring a buddy or a gal at work, however that works out in your world, bring somebody to hear that day, the greatest message of all, not because it comes from me, the greatest message because it's about Jesus and the way that he satisfies, the way that he fills, the way that he is all that you and I could ever want or need, the bread of life.
[time=174] Can't wait to see you, can't wait to be a part of that day together with you, can't wait to see what God's gonna do in your life and in the lives of those who come and celebrate the resurrection.
[time=185] Hey, thank you for tuning in, as always.
[time=187] It's good to be with you and we can't wait to see you face to face.
[time=191] [MUSIC - 183 seconds]
[time=377] (audience applauding)
[time=389] - Let's stand together, if you would, and let's sing the praises of our God.
[time=396] Crown Him with our praise this morning.
[time=399] He's worthy to be praised.
[time=401] We want to sing about it together.
[time=403] Sing us with Jane.
[time=404] [MUSIC - 467 seconds]
[time=883] - Question for you this morning.
[time=886] As we start out in our study of Ruth 4, do you trust God?
[time=890] It might seem like kind of a generic, you know, high level question I want to just ask you again and I want you to think about it very honestly, very personally, very intimately.
[time=903] Do you, do you really trust God with every part of,
[time=911] every aspect of every circumstance, every situation, every joy, every trial?
[time=918] Do you trust God?
[time=922] I want you to think of a time, second question for you.
[time=927] Think of a time in your life when you knew what the right thing to do was.
[time=931] Maybe this takes you back to last night, maybe it takes you back to last week, maybe it takes you back to something that happened 15, 20 years ago.
[time=938] Think of a time when you knew what the right thing to do was and you didn't do it.
[time=943] Think of a time when you knew what the right thing to do was
[time=949] and you didn't do it.
[time=952] Why didn't you do it?
[time=954] What were you thinking?
[time=956] What was going on there?
[time=957] What was guiding your choice?
[time=960] Let me read you, you don't have to turn here.
[time=961] Jonah chapter one just popped in my head as I was thinking about it this week.
[time=965] The word of the Lord came to Jonah.
[time=967] Jonah was a prophet.
[time=969] Jonah was a prophet called by God.
[time=971] Jonah knew God.
[time=972] Jonah was familiar with this idea of hearing from God.
[time=976] This was not a surprise to Jonah that he would hear the word of the Lord.
[time=980] The word of the Lord came to Jonah, the son of Amatized, saying, "Arise Jonah, go to Nineveh." The great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me.
[time=991] There's the right thing to do.
[time=992] The right thing to do would be to do what God told you to do.
[time=996] And most of you know that Jonah didn't do what God called him to do.
[time=1001] Jonah didn't do the right thing.
[time=1004] Jonah wasn't so sure how that was gonna go.
[time=1008] How it might go wasn't real consistent with what Jonah wanted.
[time=1013] Does this sound familiar at all?
[time=1014] As you think about time, as you've not done, what God called you to do?
[time=1019] Do you trust God?
[time=1021] Do you really trust God?
[time=1024] Jonah ends up in the belly of a whale.
[time=1028] His agenda, what he wanted, what he chose to do, didn't work out so well.
[time=1034] He avoids doing the right thing and pays a price.
[time=1037] Hosea 14.9 gives us some insight on this idea, my friends, of what we'll look at this morning and what we'll look at this morning is doing the right thing.
[time=1046] Doing the right thing.
[time=1049] Hosea 14.9, I love how it reads, whoever is wise, whoever is wise, let him understand these things.
[time=1058] Whoever is discerning, let him know them for the ways of the Lord.
[time=1064] What God says, what God does, who God is, the ways of the Lord, everything about the Lord is what, say it out loud church, right.
[time=1076] For the ways of the Lord are right and the righteous.
[time=1083] Those who do what's right will walk in them, walk in his ways, but transgressors will end up in the belly of whales.
[time=1096] Transgressors will, what's it say, will stumble in them.
[time=1101] Doing what's right.
[time=1104] Doing what's right reveals your character.
[time=1110] Doing what's right reveals integrity.
[time=1113] Most all of the time, I think most of you in the room this morning would agree with me on this, most all of the time in your heart and your mind down deep in your soul, you know when something's right.
[time=1124] And you know, don't you, when something's wrong.
[time=1127] And while most all of the time doing the right thing isn't rocket science, it does require a choice.
[time=1135] It does require a decision from you and from me.
[time=1138] And this morning I'm here to beg you.
[time=1140] I'm here to encourage you to teach you and illustrate for you again from the life of Boaz, the great value, the great blessing 12 year olds in the room, 18 year olds in the room, young married couples, young families, senior adults, every single person here with an earshot of my voice.
[time=1161] I'm here to remind you of the great value, the great blessing, the peace and the fruit that comes from choosing to do in the everyday of life, in the little and the big, in the public and the private.
[time=1176] What's right?
[time=1181] And as we start this morning, I just wanna let the word of God, I wanna let scripture do what only scripture can do and that is just give you clear understanding and insight.
[time=1191] I want your heart to be encouraged.
[time=1193] I want your heart to be convicted.
[time=1195] I want the spirit of God through the word of God to just in these next few minutes, do its unique work in the people of God.
[time=1204] And so allow these words as they relate to this issue of you and I being a people who are willing and ready to do the right thing, let these words encourage you.
[time=1213] Look what it says regarding the ways of the Lord being right.
[time=1217] We're gonna go to Proverbs 11.
[time=1219] You don't have to turn there.
[time=1221] Let me read to you from the screen, Proverbs 11.3.
[time=1223] If you do the right thing, you can sit here and look at me, you can bow your heads.
[time=1229] You can take this in however you want to, but please church, take this in.
[time=1233] If you do the right thing, honesty will be your guide.
[time=1240] You could have a lot of guides in your life.
[time=1248] God's word reminds you this morning that if you do the right thing, honesty will be your guide, but if you are crooked, you will be trapped by your own dishonesty.
[time=1260] Probably important to just say upfront, just so we're clear.
[time=1266] When it comes to defining the right thing, you're gonna hear me say this a lot this morning, the right thing, how do we know what the right thing is?
[time=1278] Just so we're clear, if you're in black Hawk circles by being part of this crew, the way we look at this and the way I would say that to you, the way I would answer that question is the right thing is what this says.
[time=1290] This we believe to be right.
[time=1294] This we believe to be God's word to us in all aspects and on all fronts of life.
[time=1303] And so as I have questions and I do all the time, as you have questions about what's right and wrong, we always come back to this.
[time=1311] And so it says do the right, if you do the right thing, honesty will be your guide.
[time=1315] You go on Proverbs 11 to verse 19.
[time=1318] Proverbs 11, 19, 11, 20, 27, 11, 19 says always do the right thing and you will live.
[time=1326] Please jot that down, please make a note of that.
[time=1329] And understand that when it says always do the right thing and you will live, yes, it's talking about your heartbeat, yes, it's talking about the physical flow of blood because yes, there have been times when God has in discipline removed life for disobedience but understand that in this passage, this word live really has a greater connotation of the kind of life because there is a kind of living.
[time=1356] Many of you in the room know this.
[time=1357] There is a kind of living that's not really living.
[time=1361] There is an empty, futile, dark, lonely, distant life that can be lived that's not very good life.
[time=1373] And the word of God reminds us here, do the right thing and you will live.
[time=1378] You can live the way God designed you to live.
[time=1381] You can live full, you can live in peace, you can live with meaning, you can live with joy.
[time=1389] When you're a person who's willing to always do the right thing, keep doing wrong and you will die, same thing there.
[time=1397] Physically, literally, possibly, but more than that it's talking about the quality of life.
[time=1403] Stay away from the wrong thing, do what's right.
[time=1405] Look at Proverbs 11, 20, the Lord hates sneaky people but he likes everyone who lives right.
[time=1414] Everyone who lives true.
[time=1417] Everyone who lives out in the open.
[time=1420] We're gonna talk about this this morning.
[time=1421] Let me say it to you again.
[time=1423] The willingness to live out in the open.
[time=1426] Not behind a closed door, but out in the open.
[time=1431] Love what it says there.
[time=1433] Try hard to do right.
[time=1435] I just like the way that reads.
[time=1439] Sometimes you and I get caught up in thinking that it's all him.
[time=1442] Sometimes I talk to you about how he's going to complete what he started in you.
[time=1446] Sometimes we talk about the power of God at work in your life and we should talk about those things and you should bank on that.
[time=1453] But the flip side of that coin is that you and I are called, not as it relates to saving ourselves, we can't do that, but growing in our faith, guess what?
[time=1462] It requires hard, disciplined effort.
[time=1466] And it's a great reminder for us this morning on this doing what's right front.
[time=1472] He says work hard at it.
[time=1475] Work very, very hard at it and you will win friends.
[time=1480] Go looking for trouble and you will find it.
[time=1482] And I love what it says in verse 30.
[time=1485] It says in verse 30, live right and you will eat from the life-giving tree.
[time=1491] And if you act wisely, others will follow.
[time=1493] Nice little note there in my Bible, as I looked at it this week, when it talks about live right and you will eat from the life-giving tree a lot there.
[time=1504] But part of what's referred to when it talks about a tree and living right, it's talking about your tree and your tree is oftentimes that which comes from you.
[time=1515] Your limbs, your branches, your roots, your family, your kids, your relationships, there's this tree picture and it goes beyond you, but it kind of comes from you.
[time=1527] And when you do the right thing, you have the opportunity to see that be fruitful and productive.
[time=1535] You're about to watch Bo as my friends in a very interesting situation, do the right thing.
[time=1542] As we make our way through these final 20 verses, we're gonna discover together what happens when you do the right thing.
[time=1549] What happens when you trust God?
[time=1552] I asked you that at the beginning.
[time=1553] I'm gonna keep asking it to you as we go.
[time=1555] What happens when you do the right thing?
[time=1557] What are the results when you young or old in the room this morning?
[time=1562] What are the results when you do, when you choose, when you value the right thing?
[time=1568] You learn trust.
[time=1571] I'll tell you the three things right now.
[time=1573] I hope you write these down.
[time=1574] Then we're gonna come back and just read through and again, do what we've been doing.
[time=1577] We're gonna identify principles as we go.
[time=1579] Here's the first thing that happens.
[time=1580] When you do the right thing, you learn to trust God.
[time=1585] With results.
[time=1587] This is big.
[time=1588] This is really big.
[time=1589] You learn to trust God with results.
[time=1590] Secondly, you earn the respect of others.
[time=1593] You do, I wanna show this to you here in our text.
[time=1595] You earn the respect and admiration of others.
[time=1598] And thirdly, you receive the blessing from God, reserved for those willing to trust.
[time=1605] Let's look at that first section.
[time=1607] You learn to trust God with results versus one to eight.
[time=1612] I'm gonna start in here at the beginning of four, follow along with me.
[time=1614] It says there in verse one of chapter four.
[time=1618] Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there.
[time=1621] Stop right there.
[time=1622] Remember what happened at the end of three.
[time=1624] At the end of three, there's been this spectacular scene that kind of unfolded last week in our study at the threshing floor.
[time=1631] We got the whole relationship with Boaz and Ruth.
[time=1635] This thing kind of came to a pinnacle.
[time=1638] She goes and in essence makes her readiness, her willingness, her openness to Boaz, makes it known to him in the privacy of that setting.
[time=1649] And he kind of reciprocates and thanks her for her interest and her willingness.
[time=1654] He sort of basically declares his love for her and he thanks her for her kindness in opening herself up to him.
[time=1665] And the music starts to play and the eyes begin to sparkle.
[time=1670] And we think we're right at the culmination of this unbelievable love drama story.
[time=1676] And then in the last moment the music stops and he says, "Wait a minute.
[time=1680] "I know you and Naomi think I'm your kinsman redeemer.
[time=1684] "I know according to the law of God, "which you two have been functioning with "that you've come to me tonight "and you're doing what you're doing, "lay it at my feet and all this stuff "and declaring your love and your openness to me "because you think I'm your closest relative." And he says to her, it must have been really tough because he was really, you know, he was there but he says to her, "End of three, "I'm not your closest relative." There's like this dude in town who is and it's not me.
[time=1714] And so we're gonna have to kind of come back at this thing.
[time=1719] And that's where we got left off on three and Naomi says to Ruth, "End of three, "he's gonna deal with it.
[time=1726] "You watch, he'll deal with this thing immediately "because Naomi knew the kind of man that Boaz was." And so here we go, chapter four verse one.
[time=1736] Now Boaz went up to the gate of the city and sat down there and behold, the close relative of whom Boaz spoke was passing by.
[time=1749] So he said to the close relative, "Turn aside." It's kind of in the way we would say today is we would say, "Oh, stop." Side, this guy was going somewhere and Boaz says, "Wait, stop.
[time=1761] "Turn aside, friends, sit down here." And he turned aside and the guy sat down.
[time=1767] Boaz then took 10 men of the elders of the city and said to them, "Sit down here." So they sat down, tells you a lot about the respect Boaz had in the eyes of those in that city.
[time=1781] He speaks and people listen.
[time=1783] He calls folks to sit down and they sit.
[time=1786] I want to just tell you a little bit about those first two verses.
[time=1790] Watch this and it's amazing how God uses this to help us, I think, see some things today.
[time=1795] The gate, the gate of the city.
[time=1798] I want you just to understand in the culture and the context of that day why this was so important.
[time=1805] As you read about the culture and the context of that day, okay, timeout, I got to show you this picture.
[time=1813] Just real quick, speaking of the culture and the context of that day, a little sidebar, but you'll love this.
[time=1819] I'm in my office early in the week and I get a text picture from Curtis Smith, chief meteorologist channel 21.
[time=1829] I'm sure some of you know who he is.
[time=1831] I'm sure a lot of you don't 'cause you watch whatever the other guy's name is on the other channel.
[time=1835] But wait, how many watch Curtis?
[time=1838] Raise your hand.
[time=1839] Okay, hands down, how many watch the other guy?
[time=1842] Aw, I'll tell 'em hundreds raise their hands on the other guy.
[time=1846] So he's in the Holy Land with Kenanora Stewart with Hear Care and channel 21.
[time=1851] They're doing this amazing trip over there and Curtis sends me this picture and he says, "Bird," the text said, "Bird, I'm standing overlooking "the Sea of Galilee." And right then my heart just went, "Wow." Like he's there, that's the Sea of Galilee.
[time=1868] Just think of all that happened right there on that.
[time=1872] Body of water.
[time=1873] I mean, it's really there, it's unbelievable.
[time=1876] He says, "Bird, though, the mountains on the right." He says, "The mountains on the right." Over the mountains on the right, he says, "Is modern day Jordan." He says, "It's ancient Moab." He said, "On the other side of those hills "is where Ruth and Naomi came from." And Curtis and Jesse, you know, they've been here for the first half of our study and they're taking all this stuff in.
[time=1902] So he gets to go stand and look at the mountains that Ruth and Naomi literally traveled over to come and move back into the region of Bethlehem, an amazing picture, real place, real stuff.
[time=1916] This isn't made up, my friends.
[time=1918] This is a real truth and it was so cool to hear from him.
[time=1921] So the gate, the study of history and culture lets us know that in the day of Boaz, Ruth and Naomi, everything judicially, everything socially, everything economically happened at the gate of the city.
[time=1935] When they did excavations on Rome, they found forums and they found huge venues inside the city parameters where large gatherings would happen when they excavate Israel, when they excavate Judah, what they find is gates.
[time=1952] They find the city gates and it was at the city gate where everything happened.
[time=1958] It was at the city gate where everyone gathered.
[time=1961] It was at the city gate where legal and spiritual and personal issues got resolved.
[time=1968] It was very public.
[time=1971] I just want you to hang onto that.
[time=1974] It was very, very public.
[time=1978] Boaz knew that there was a place and a process that he must now submit himself to in order to see if what he wanted was what God wanted for him.
[time=1991] I ask you again, do you trust God?
[time=1996] Do you trust God?
[time=1998] Here's Boaz trying to figure out if what he wanted was what God wanted.
[time=2002] Here we go back to verse three.
[time=2003] Then he said to the closest relative.
[time=2005] All right guy, here you are.
[time=2007] Listen, Naomi who has come back from the land of Moab has to sell the piece of land which belonged to interesting phrase, our brother.
[time=2016] Alimelech.
[time=2018] So it would appear as if now he's talking to another brother who's, watch this, this is cool how it all ties together.
[time=2025] The if it's a brother and he has first dibs then it on Ruth then most likely though it might sound contradictory to you, it's probably a younger brother and he just got done talking about how she had kind of said pass on the younger guys.
[time=2042] And now here he is bringing a younger guy closer to her age, interesting, interesting insight.
[time=2049] Our brother Alimelech, so I thought to inform you brother
[time=2055] saying buy it before those who are sitting here and before the elders of my people if you will redeem it, redeem it.
[time=2063] But if not tell me that I may know for there is no one but you to redeem it and I am after you.
[time=2069] And he said I will redeem it.
[time=2074] And Boaz's heart must have just dropped.
[time=2078] Ever been in that spot where all of a sudden you realize this might be going a certain way and it wasn't what you wanted to hear.
[time=2083] But Boaz should have been a lawyer, this brilliant presentation, watch this.
[time=2090] Then Boaz said on the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi you must also acquire Ruth, the Moabite, the widow of the deceased in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance.
[time=2103] Closest relatives said I cannot redeem it for myself because I would jeopardize my own inheritance.
[time=2110] In other words, whoa.
[time=2111] If you're talking about a bunch of dirt, I'm good with it.
[time=2114] But now if you're saying I gotta take her and marry her and have kids with her this is gonna really complicate the world of my inheritance.
[time=2123] I'm not gonna do it.
[time=2124] The closest relative says to Boaz, redeem it for yourself.
[time=2130] Wow, and the music starts again.
[time=2134] You may have my right of redemption for I cannot redeem it.
[time=2138] Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning the redemption and the exchange of land and or a widow to confirm any matter.
[time=2146] A man removed his sandal and gave it to another and this was the manner of attestation in Israel.
[time=2154] So the closest relative said to Boaz, buy it yourself and he removed his sandal.
[time=2161] He removed his sandal.
[time=2164] Let me take you back to the beginning of that passage and I wanna just have you paint this picture in your mind as you're thinking about you maybe in this spot or you in a spot similar to it.
[time=2177] I want you to see yourself, see Boaz at the gate and he knows he's gotta find this relative and his whole, I mean, come on, Boaz is on top of the world.
[time=2189] This beautiful godly woman has declared her love for him.
[time=2194] He's an older guy, he's never been married.
[time=2196] He doesn't have the one thing in that culture that meant the most, he's got no kids.
[time=2200] It's like this gift, this blessing has just shown up and you gotta know he's through the ceiling and then this complication comes up and now it looks like it might be in jeopardy and you got what you want and you wonder what God's gonna do and he goes to the gate and there's all the people and boom, there he is.
[time=2219] You see him, he's right there and what do you do?
[time=2222] Well, if you're like me, what you might do is you go, hey, he looks kind of busy.
[time=2228] You know what I mean?
[time=2231] You sort of know what you should do but there's all this on the line and you sort of wanna just say and you don't sometimes do it, sometimes you and I aren't real quick to do in those situations exactly what we should do exactly when we should do it.
[time=2249] And he says, hey, he gets him and he says come, sit down.
[time=2254] You ever notice how we tend to put things off and we're not sure how something's gonna turn out or you're pretty sure how something might play out and there's a really decent chance it might not go your way and you really wish it would go your way.
[time=2267] It's a business discussion, a relationship issue, a tough conversation.
[time=2272] So you avoid, you do two things.
[time=2274] You avoid the person and you procrastinate on the process.
[time=2279] That's what we do as we move away from what we should do.
[time=2284] We avoid the person and we procrastinate on the process.
[time=2287] You allow circumstances to dictate outcomes.
[time=2291] Six weeks goes by.
[time=2293] Sometimes with you and me, it's three months goes by and then we stand there and we say, well, you know, it just never seemed to be the right time.
[time=2300] If you said that, it just never seemed to be the right time.
[time=2303] Why?
[time=2304] Because you were afraid of not getting what you wanted.
[time=2307] You don't wanna trust God with the results.
[time=2313] You wanna somehow manipulate the results.
[time=2316] And here's what character does.
[time=2318] Here's the way of integrity.
[time=2320] Here's the Boaz approach.
[time=2322] Real character, I love this.
[time=2325] Real character is more afraid.
[time=2327] You talk about being afraid of how it's gonna turn out.
[time=2329] Real character is more afraid of the consequences that will always come when you get what you're not supposed to have.
[time=2336] That's real character.
[time=2338] Real character and integrity is more afraid of the consequences that will come when you get what you're not supposed to have.
[time=2346] So does Boaz avoid?
[time=2348] Does Boaz procrastinate?
[time=2351] No, he says stop.
[time=2352] Sit down right here now.
[time=2354] Not really sure how this thing's gonna turn out, but we're gonna deal with it right now, right here in God's prescribed manner.
[time=2362] And I'll just say this to some of you in the room this morning.
[time=2364] Some of you are avoiding someone.
[time=2366] Some of you here in the room this morning.
[time=2370] Some of you watching on live stream.
[time=2373] Some of you watching the broadcast.
[time=2375] You're avoiding someone.
[time=2378] And God has been prompting you, and God has been nudging you.
[time=2382] And under the banner of what is right, under the banner of what is good, under the banner of what is true, what you should do, what needs to transpire, you should go.
[time=2392] And you're avoiding him or her or your procrastinating,
[time=2399] putting off something that you know is the right thing to do because you fear the result.
[time=2405] And your Boaz, a reminder this morning, is this true character always trusts God for the result even with those things or with those people you really, really, really want.
[time=2420] I know there are things that you really, really want.
[time=2423] True character trusts God with those things.
[time=2428] Boaz really wanted to be with Ruth.
[time=2431] Principle number one, here you go.
[time=2433] Here's your assignment.
[time=2435] Simple but profound.
[time=2437] Do the right thing today.
[time=2443] Whatever that right thing is for you.
[time=2446] Whatever the nudge has been, whatever the prompting has looked like, whatever it is you need to do in order to do the right thing, I want to encourage you in these next hours today, if at all possible, before the sun goes down, do the right thing.
[time=2463] Second principle, second thing you learn about doing the right thing, when you do the right thing, you earn the respect, the admiration of others.
[time=2473] I want to show you this in the text, pick it up in verse nine, then Boaz.
[time=2478] I mean, the guy said, I can't buy it, it's yours.
[time=2481] It's yours and she's yours.
[time=2483] And the sandal gets passed and is done.
[time=2486] I mean, officially it's done, but look what Boaz does.
[time=2490] Look how he responds.
[time=2491] Then Boaz turns, he says to the elders and all the people, you are witnesses today, that I have bought from the hand of Naomi, all that belong to a limalek and all that belong to Chilean and all that belong to Milan, moreover, those are the two sons of a limalek that died over in Moab.
[time=2510] Moreover, verse 10, I have acquired Ruth, the Moabitis, the widow of Milan to be my wife in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance so that the name of the deceased will not be cut off from his brothers or from the court of his birthplace.
[time=2530] You are witnesses today and all the people who were in the court and the elders said, we are witnesses.
[time=2539] May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel.
[time=2546] And may you, Boaz, achieve wealth in Ephratha and become famous in Bethlehem.
[time=2554] Moreover, may your house be like the house of Perez and tame our boarded Judah through the offspring, which the Lord will give you by this young woman.
[time=2564] It's a very interesting phrase in the text that I want you to take note of.
[time=2567] I want you to write this down, circle it.
[time=2570] It's a great picture for us to take with us today.
[time=2573] All the people, verse 11, all the people, it noted it earlier in the text.
[time=2579] There's two places there where it talks about all the people and the elders.
[time=2583] And what I want you to understand about that when you kind of dive into that and translate that literally.
[time=2590] What that means is he had at the gate all the people would be all his friends.
[time=2598] All the people would be those that knew him, those whom he knew, all the people, it was the public, the general public that would have been involved in his life.
[time=2607] It was almost like a small community, if you will, of people and it would give indication that there were many.
[time=2614] So you have all the people, all the buddies, if you will, but you also have the spiritual authority.
[time=2620] You have the elders.
[time=2621] The text is really clear.
[time=2622] All the people and the elders, spiritual authority, spiritual wisdom, everybody who knew him.
[time=2629] He wanted desperately to go into the public setting.
[time=2634] He didn't want to be sneaky.
[time=2638] He wanted to be transparent.
[time=2640] And so in essence, everybody who knew him and all those who were responsible for him get to take all this whole thing in.
[time=2648] It's really a great picture.
[time=2649] Look at Proverbs 22.
[time=2651] One, why would that be so important to Boaz and why would it be so important to you?
[time=2656] Well, look what it says in Proverbs 22.1, it says a good name, a reputation.
[time=2662] A good name is to be more desired than money.
[time=2667] A good reputation is to be more desired than great wealth, favor, reputation.
[time=2673] People thinking well of you is better than silver and gold.
[time=2677] And then it says in Proverbs three, back several chapters, verses three and four.
[time=2681] It says, do not let kindness and truth leave you.
[time=2685] Bind them around your neck.
[time=2686] These are the right things, kindness and truth.
[time=2691] Write them on the tablet of your heart so you will find favor and good repute in the sight of God, all the elders and man, all the people.
[time=2703] This is exactly what he was doing.
[time=2707] He didn't want, are you this way?
[time=2710] He didn't want anybody to have any questions at all.
[time=2719] So he doesn't go private.
[time=2722] I'll just kind of figure this out on my own, which he could have done back at the threshing floor.
[time=2728] He didn't do it there.
[time=2729] He doesn't go private when the dude does the sandal thing
[time=2735] and says I'm not buying her.
[time=2737] No, he goes a step further and he goes as public as he can go in an effort to have the kind of reputation that a good man has.
[time=2748] Sometimes I hear people say, sometimes I'll hear myself say this, maybe you've said this, I don't care what people think of me or my decisions.
[time=2758] Sometimes I've heard people say, I don't care what people think of me and sometimes they say that well and sometimes they don't and I say sometimes they don't because I want to just make sure we're all clear on this.
[time=2772] You should care.
[time=2774] I'm not talking about people pleasing.
[time=2779] I'm not talking about the random opinion of the public.
[time=2783] Listen, you should care when what's right is on the line.
[time=2788] If we're talking about what's right, if we're talking about what's true, if we're talking about what's good, if we're talking about kindness, if we're talking about the principles of God, usually we should care deeply.
[time=2802] People's approval, people's opinion, not so much, but their respect.
[time=2809] Their respect you and I should care deeply about.
[time=2813] Boaz moves away from the sneaky corners
[time=2819] of private thinking and moves it right out into the realm of those who knew him.
[time=2826] What's God's, what Godly opinion, let me just ask you this, what Godly opinion should you be seeking out right now in your life publicly?
[time=2838] Like, is there a willingness in you?
[time=2843] I hope there would be to actually go to the city gate, to actually go and sit down with some people who you trust and some authorities in your life.
[time=2853] And would you be willing to say I got this thing going on, I've got this struggle, I've got this circumstance, I've got this predicament, will you all help me?
[time=2863] Will you speak into this?
[time=2864] Will you be aware of how I'm traveling this road?
[time=2868] What a huge benefit for you and for me to live more and more of our lives and our decision-making in public?
[time=2877] What have you heard from either good friends or spiritual authorities in your life that should have stopped you in your tracks six months ago or six years ago?
[time=2889] What did they tell you at the gate that you didn't listen to?
[time=2897] And now today in some way, small or large, you're experiencing the consequences of living in private and not living in wisdom, not living in public, not living in the integrity and the character of doing the right thing.
[time=2915] Maybe it's God giving you an opportunity today to make that right, to go back and listen to what was said to begin to enact that into the everyday of your life, to make amends, to seek forgiveness, to change patterns, to put new things in place that desperately need to be there.
[time=2934] Last question for you on that front, what do you care most about?
[time=2939] What do you care most about?
[time=2945] This is for young people, this is for old people, all of us deal with this, having what you want today or trusting God with your tomorrow.
[time=2952] Having what you want right now or being willing to trust him, do the right thing
[time=2963] and down the road experience the blessing that comes.
[time=2968] You've heard it often said, I have too, too many times we sacrifice the future on the altar of the immediate and I hope and I pray that as you look at this man Boaz and the character and the substance of his life and the way he operates and the way he moves, I hope you're encouraged.
[time=2986] Look what happens.
[time=2988] As we wrap this up, actually, next week we'll wrap up the entire study.
[time=2993] You don't wanna miss it.
[time=2994] You're gonna have a chance to look back over the whole thing and with Steve Webster's help figure out how it is we should respond, but let me take you back.
[time=3002] That says in verse 13, so Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife and he went into her and the Lord enabled her to conceive and she gave birth to a son.
[time=3011] Then the women said to Naomi, here's another great blessing that comes.
[time=3015] They said to Naomi, blessed is the Lord who has not left you without a redeemer today.
[time=3020] And may his name become famous in Israel.
[time=3023] Oh, did it.
[time=3024] May he also be to you a restorer of life and a sustainer of your old age for your daughter-in-law who loves you and is better to you than seven sons has given birth to him.
[time=3040] All daughters-in-laws in the room, there's your standard right there, be better to your mother-in-law than seven sons.
[time=3047] Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her lap and became his nurse.
[time=3054] She becomes intimately involved in the nurturing of this boy.
[time=3058] The neighbor women gave him a name saying, "A son has been born to Naomi." So they named him Obed.
[time=3064] He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
[time=3067] Now these are the generations of Perez.
[time=3072] To Perez was born, has Ron, and to his Ron was born Ram, and to Ram, and to him, and to him, and to him, and to him, and to Sean, and to him, to Sean, Salmon, and to Salmon was born Boaz.
[time=3083] And to Boaz, Obed.
[time=3085] And to Obed was born Jesse.
[time=3088] And to Jesse David.
[time=3090] And to David was born eventually, the Messiah,
[time=3096] the great Redeemer, the great restorer,
[time=3102] the one who like Boaz, who is a Christ type, did the right thing, and in doing the right thing, brought salvation.
[time=3115] We tend to be so desperately devoted to today, while Godly wisdom tends to invite us, and our choices, to consider tomorrow.
[time=3125] Boaz wants no part of a future that Godly wisdom hasn't blessed.
[time=3133] And so I leave you with that picture this morning, part three in your outline, talks about experiencing the blessing that God reserves for those who trust Him.
[time=3147] You receive the blessing from God, reserve for those willing to trust.
[time=3151] And I'll just take you back, as Corbin comes up, I just take you back to where we started.
[time=3156] I know most of you, I know the circumstances that you deal with, I know how difficult it can be at times.
[time=3165] It reminds me of that cable commercial.
[time=3167] I don't see it much anymore.
[time=3169] We laugh at it, but it really is actually quite profound, and I probably won't say it right, but the cable commercial where the guy pops off to the guys on the bus, and before you know it, he's running down the street, and then before you know it, they catch him and he ends up in a ditch, and it says don't end up in a ditch, you know, get cable or whatever it was.
[time=3190] I wanna just remind you this morning, don't end up in the belly of a whale.
[time=3193] Don't end up in the messy, dicey, embarrassing,
[time=3201] lonely, distant places that you go when you don't do the right thing.
[time=3209] Do the right thing, do it, and in the process, learn what it means like to trust God with the results, do it, the right thing, and experience what it's like to have the admiration and the trust and the respect of people who see you living your life, not perfectly, but openly, do it.
[time=3231] And experience the blessing reserved by God for those who trust Him.
[time=3237] Our Father in Heaven, we pray that you would take these principles and these truths, oh God, cement them in our hearts and souls this morning that we pray.
[time=3246] For it's in your Son's name that we pray, amen.
[time=3250] (gentle piano music)
[time=3259] I will rise, I will rise As Christ was raised to life, now we're here, now we're here, I will live.
[time=3326] Your kingdom knows no end, Your praise goes on for you, and on and on again, no power can stand against you, no curse or salt you've thrown.
[time=3342] No one can steal your copy, for it is yours and well, I'd stand to see your praises, I'd stand to testify, but I was dead in my sin, and now I rise, I will rise.
[time=3366] As Christ was raised to life, now we're here, now we're here, I will live.
