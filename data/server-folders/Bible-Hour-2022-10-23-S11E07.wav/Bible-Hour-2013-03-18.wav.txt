[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] What an incredibly special day it is today.
[time=36] As you watch this, it is Resurrection Sunday.
[time=39] Easter is something that we look forward to and can't wait to participate in.
[time=45] It is a celebration of life, a celebration of forgiveness, a celebration of hope and meaning.
[time=51] And most of you know that at Black Hawk, we've been preparing, we call it the preparation, the last six weeks leading up to Resurrection Sunday.
[time=59] We've been fasting, different things.
[time=61] We've been immersing ourselves as a church family in the scriptures reading preparation, resurrection scriptures every day for the last six weeks.
[time=72] We've been giving above and beyond financially toward our alms offering.
[time=78] And today we culminate with a tremendous celebration at nine and 1045.
[time=84] I want to say this to you as you watch this, there's still time for many of you to come and be with us at 1045.
[time=90] There really is.
[time=91] I know some of you watch and we are your church in a sense.
[time=95] I know others of you are in crisis.
[time=97] I know others of you are trying to figure out where God fits if he does it all in your life.
[time=103] And I want to just say to you right now, somewhat early on a Sunday morning, I hope you'll get dressed, I hope you'll get up.
[time=110] I hope you'll get in your car, call for a ride, whatever you need to do.
[time=113] I hope today this Resurrection Sunday you'll come and be with us at 1045.
[time=119] We would love to have you.
[time=120] If you can't make it, then join us on live stream at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=125] We've seen hundreds of people start to watch on a weekly basis on our live stream broadcast at our website, you can join us there.
[time=134] I want you to know on behalf of the entire Blackhawk Ministries family on behalf of the Bible, our crew, we're so thankful for you.
[time=141] Thankful for your partnership in this ministry.
[time=144] Thankful that we get to share with you the life-changing, and it really is life-changing, eternity-altering truth of God's Word.
[time=155] It means so much to us and we're thankful for the chance to experience it together with you.
[time=160] God bless you.
[time=160] Happy Resurrection Sunday, and I hope you'll come and be with us here today.
[time=165] God bless you, and as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=562] - Thank you, thank you for singing this morning.
[time=570] If Christ has not been raised,
[time=577] then your faith is useless and you are still guilty of your sins.
[time=582] In that case, all who have died believing in Christ are lost.
[time=588] If our hope in Christ is only for this life, we are more to be pitied than anyone in the world.
[time=594] But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead.
[time=601] He is the first of a great harvest of all who have died.
[time=607] So you see, just as death came into the world through a man, now the resurrection from the dead has begun through another man.
[time=616] Just as everyone dies because we all belong to Adam, everyone who belongs to Christ will be given new life.
[time=624] That's where we're headed, friends.
[time=627] And it is our sincere desire that that would be the destiny of each person in this room.
[time=636] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=637] I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=639] I'm so grateful for a team of men that God has called to serve you in this way.
[time=646] I'm so grateful for the team.
[time=648] I'm grateful for these words.
[time=649] Listen to this.
[time=651] I rise as you are risen.
[time=654] Declare your rule and drain.
[time=656] My life confess your lordship and glorify your name.
[time=660] Your word, it stands eternal.
[time=661] Your kingdom knows no end.
[time=663] Your praise goes on forever and on and on again.
[time=667] No power can stand against you, no curse, assault your throne.
[time=671] No one can steal your glory, but it's yours alone.
[time=675] I stand to sing your praises.
[time=676] I stand to testify for I was dead in my sin.
[time=681] I was, I was past tense by the grace of God.
[time=686] And I sincerely pray and hope that today that your hearts and that your eyes and that your ears would be open to what God will say.
[time=696] So grateful for the team that we're on here at Black Hawk.
[time=702] You guys, we've as a ministry rallied around five elements that will be on the screens behind me in front of you.
[time=709] These are not five things that you must do to gain relationship with God.
[time=716] I need you to understand that very, very carefully.
[time=719] It's a very dangerous presumption.
[time=722] So let me just clarify.
[time=723] You see those hands, prayerful abiding.
[time=726] We believe that in our study again at the Gospels and Acts, years ago, that these are five things that shown out in lives who had decided to follow Jesus.
[time=737] These things don't flow into relationship from God.
[time=740] They flow out from relationship to God.
[time=742] Prayerful abiding Christ himself goes away by himself often to pray.
[time=747] There's that light, the Word of God is the light and the lamp to our feet and to our path.
[time=753] In your bulletins, again this morning, is digging deeper.
[time=757] We begin doing this as an insert, when we begin our study of Ruth a few weeks ago, we want to do everything we possibly can to help you to be devoted to God's Word.
[time=766] And so we give you resources.
[time=769] Week after week, month after month.
[time=772] The preparation readings that have been posted on our website and the beginning text alerts about for weeks now are all part of the endeavor to encourage you to help you in your devotion to God's Word.
[time=784] There is no other, your Word stands eternal.
[time=788] And we believe that to be true.
[time=790] There is a transformation with those of the two hearts in our transformational community that we believe that life change happens best in smaller settings.
[time=798] We need this community together here right now, but we want to offer you opportunities week by week as often as we can to get together in smaller settings and really live life on life together.
[time=809] Those bubbles over there on the corner, transformational community, missional serving, serving outward, making disciples of the last two in the middle and on the right there.
[time=821] Making disciples is a revelation friends that the story that we're involved in was meant to be told.
[time=828] If I see a great movie or I'm excited about a new album, record, CD, how's that?
[time=833] (audience laughing) That has come out.
[time=835] Sorry.
[time=837] I'm gonna tell people about it.
[time=841] Have you heard this?
[time=842] Record?
[time=845] Spinning?
[time=845] No.
[time=846] Don't make the tragic mistake, friends.
[time=850] And please understand that those five things, I can't over communicate enough.
[time=855] These five things flow out of a heart already changed.
[time=859] They don't flow into, you can't do this good enough.
[time=861] You can't pray enough.
[time=863] You can't read your Bible enough.
[time=864] You can't go to enough small groups.
[time=865] You can't serve enough.
[time=868] You can't tell enough stories.
[time=870] Jesus has already done all those things.
[time=872] He has made a sufficient sacrifice for your sins already.
[time=877] And if you place your faith and trust in him, and my prayer is it today, as we look back at Ruth and the whole story, but that will be, his spirit will draw you to himself this morning.
[time=887] Some verses to read as we begin today on this front.
[time=890] Titus chapter three, if you have your Bibles, go to Titus.
[time=893] Toward the back of the New Testament, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, James, go to James, turn left.
[time=900] You'll find Titus, a little book tucked away.
[time=903] Paul wrote to Titus a pastor serving in a little island called Crete, it's a real place.
[time=908] You can still visit there today.
[time=910] He wrote this letter to encourage a young pastor, ministering in tough circumstances.
[time=917] Listen carefully, I'm gonna read Titus chapter three, verses four through eight.
[time=922] These are some verses that I come back to.
[time=925] Do you have those verses that you just kinda come back to a lot?
[time=928] This is, these are some of those verses for me.
[time=930] But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior.
[time=954] So that being made right, justified by his grace, might become heirs.
[time=961] According to the hope of eternal life, the saying is trustworthy.
[time=966] And I want you to insist on these things, that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works.
[time=973] Faith and works are friends.
[time=976] These things are excellent and profitable for people.
[time=979] I encourage you without this morning, that they're not mutually exclusive.
[time=985] Ephesians two, eight, nine and 10, we've been saved by grace through faith.
[time=989] Four good works created in Christ Jesus first 10 of Ephesians two, four good works.
[time=994] I encourage you with that this morning.
[time=997] Well, we begin our journey through Ruth in the snow on February 17th, and I think it's coming, not here yet though, but it's coming today.
[time=1006] Sorry, at that point, that's bad news.
[time=1010] Here's comes the good news.
[time=1012] At that point, we were beginning our season of preparation, which is a solemn, disciplined remembrance of the sacrifice of the son of Jesus.
[time=1021] It's his story that binds the whole story of the Bible together.
[time=1026] It's a story of a rescue, and of somebody who has come as our rescuer.
[time=1030] Ruth, I've been so amazed week after week to hear so many people say, I love this story.
[time=1038] Everybody loves Ruth.
[time=1040] It would take you about 15 minutes to read it through if you read slow.
[time=1044] If you're jumping in today, if you're watching on the broadcast, if you're listening later in the week, whatever the case might be, and we're jumping in again at the end here of the story, kind of looking back on the whole thing together.
[time=1055] If you're here, you haven't read it recently, just start to finish, do it this week.
[time=1060] It'll be a good use of your time.
[time=1062] It's a story of troubled times, war, strife, famine.
[time=1067] Judges is the book that comes before Ruth, and judges said that in those days, the last verse of Judges says that everyone did what was right in his own eyes, like our day, permissiveness, and people seeking after their own selfish pleasures.
[time=1081] It's not just their story, it's ours too.
[time=1084] It isn't the whole story though.
[time=1086] God hadn't forgotten his people, and God hasn't forgotten you today.
[time=1091] God, in fact, friends, has only mentioned directly, like he inserts himself in the story twice in Ruth.
[time=1098] The first time, you can go back to the Old Testament in Ruth, now, go ahead, turn back.
[time=1104] It's a beautiful sound to your pages turning, it's music.
[time=1107] Ruth chapter one, Joshua judges Ruth, keep going.
[time=1111] You'll find it.
[time=1113] God has only mentioned twice in Ruth.
[time=1117] The first time is in Ruth chapter one, in verse six, when he visits his people and gives them food, embedded, built in, underneath everything in Ruth, dear friends, is a belief in the sovereignty of God, which we'll define for you here in just a couple of minutes.
[time=1134] But you'll see it play out, verse by verse, chapter by chapter, page by page.
[time=1138] He's also mentioned, again, in chapter four, turn over to chapter four in verse 13.
[time=1144] Short story, it's a beautiful, short story.
[time=1149] Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife.
[time=1152] And he went into her and the Lord gave her conception and she bore a son.
[time=1158] God visits his people in moments of famine, in moments of barrenness, of isolation, of aloneness.
[time=1166] Maybe it's in those moments of quiet desperation.
[time=1168] When he seems most absent that he's actually most present.
[time=1179] If it was never cold, we'd never long for the warmth of spring.
[time=1183] Nothing to look forward to.
[time=1184] I'm grateful for that here.
[time=1186] I'm longing for the warmth of spring today.
[time=1188] If you're bracket, your NCA turn bracket was destined for inevitable success and you picked Florida Gulf Coast University to beat Georgetown on Friday, you wouldn't be surprised.
[time=1199] You wouldn't be happy if you won your bracket if you couldn't lose.
[time=1202] You understand?
[time=1204] I think you do.
[time=1206] The bracket apocalypse has happened to all of us, I'm sure, at some point in the last few days.
[time=1210] We can't see the whole picture.
[time=1211] We're frail.
[time=1213] I, too, my students, felt my bracket for me this year 'cause I just, I can't get it right.
[time=1216] I should probably just flip a coin.
[time=1217] We'll see.
[time=1218] Things are not always what they seem.
[time=1220] Maybe in those panicked and hopeless moments, moments where it seems like Naomi says in chapter one, verse 20, "The God has dealt very bitterly with Naomi." And she's right.
[time=1233] She leaves Israel with a husband and two sons that she comes back and she has a daughter-in-law only, and no sons.
[time=1240] Maybe when we recognize our station, God's ready to provide His provision and His blessing.
[time=1249] Morning, Dawns, when you begin to take your eyes off of your circumstances and you lift your eyes to the hills, the place from which your help comes, all number of things are possible.
[time=1260] This morning, we're gonna give you four takeaways from Ruth, and the first one is one that we've been over week by week, steadfastly.
[time=1267] We're gonna visit it again today.
[time=1268] The first takeaway from Ruth is this, everything in our lives flows from the hand of a good God who sovereignly and providentially works redemption for His people.
[time=1284] This is the message of Ruth.
[time=1286] This is their worldview.
[time=1287] It's the way they see the world, and we're invited into it.
[time=1290] Friends, the world that we inhabit this morning does not see things this way.
[time=1295] And we have an opportunity to tell that story to people in your cul-de-sac, at your workplace, people that you associate with, to invite them into this wonderful story.
[time=1305] Failure to recognize that God is involved in everything in our lives is maybe the great tragedy of a person's life, to lose faith, to again, fix your eyes not on Him, but on your circumstances.
[time=1320] And I invite you this morning to lift your eyes.
[time=1323] If that's all you hear me say today, to lift your eyes, I pray that you would do it, I pray that you would see Him there.
[time=1330] It's no surprise when we're told to fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, the one who loved us and the one who gave Himself for us.
[time=1340] If we fail to see God's hand, you guys, even in disappointment, maybe especially in disappointment.
[time=1346] We become a prisoner of our circumstances.
[time=1353] We're all prone to this.
[time=1354] If it wasn't for famine, by the way, if it wasn't for famine, Naomi would never have met Ruth.
[time=1360] No reason to leave Israel, but she did, with her husband, a Libelach, and two sons.
[time=1366] She meets Ruth, and Ruth is the one through which, spoiler alert, her family is reborn, literally reborn.
[time=1374] No hardship.
[time=1377] If Naomi never experiences hardship, she never meets Ruth.
[time=1382] Stories of redemption are the ones that we write about, they're the ones that we celebrate, the ones that we rally around and tell other people.
[time=1387] Have you seen this?
[time=1388] Have you heard this?
[time=1390] We give medals for people who triumph through adversity.
[time=1393] We make statues of them.
[time=1394] Triumph through and in adversity is a stuff of great story, and Ruth has it in spades.
[time=1403] Ruth begins with famine, that's why they leave Israel, and it ends with what word?
[time=1408] What's the last word of the book of Ruth?
[time=1411] David begins with famine, ends with David, the king, the one promised by God in 2 Samuel 7 to have an everlasting kingdom that would have no end.
[time=1422] He would never lack a son on the throne, and now his son, Jesus, his son, his heir, Jesus, is on that throne forever and ever.
[time=1431] It stands eternal.
[time=1433] His kingdom has no end, and he invites us to become a part of it.
[time=1437] Wow, wow, wow.
[time=1440] In M. Night Shyamalan's 2002 film "Signs, Stirring Story", the lead character Graham is played by Mel Gibson.
[time=1449] He loses his wife in a tragic freak car accident as the movie begins, and it sets in motion a crisis of faith for him, and he's a Catholic priest, and he suspends his work as a priest because he's lost his faith in a God who would take his wife from him.
[time=1464] Then a series of things are set in motion, hardships, difficulties.
[time=1471] His son's got debilitating asthma, his brother is a failed Meyer League baseball player, his daughter is a germaphobe, big time.
[time=1481] All these things, I won't spoil the story for you, all those things are deliberately in place in the story to lead him to his family's salvation, small ass salvation, to deliver his family.
[time=1493] If it wasn't for those hardships that he experienced, those things never would have taken place.
[time=1497] One thing is set in motion by the other.
[time=1501] We love Ruth for that reason, because it's triumph through adversity.
[time=1505] It's a story about reconciliation, that God loves all people despite their race.
[time=1511] God does not have the spectacles of the near redeemer in Ruth chapter four who says, "Yeah, I'll take the land, but Ruth, no thanks." That's not God's perspective.
[time=1522] Ruth is a story of reconciliation, of racial reconciliation, I'm so glad that it is.
[time=1528] God is the God of all people everywhere, amen?
[time=1532] [AMEN] You can find yourself in Ruth somewhere, like an integrate story.
[time=1537] A great story is made up of great characters.
[time=1540] Maybe you identify with Naomi's bitterness and her loss and her despair.
[time=1546] Maybe you're in that season right now.
[time=1547] Maybe you identify with Ruth's stubborn faith.
[time=1551] You're in that season right now.
[time=1553] Maybe you identify with Boaz's selfless obedience.
[time=1556] I don't know, but good characters make for great story and we have them in Ruth.
[time=1560] The first takeaway from our time together, again,
[time=1566] was that everything in our lives flows from the hand of a good God who sovereignly and providentially works redemption for his people, sovereign people.
[time=1575] Let's define that word sovereignty together again, just so we can rally around it, so we can see through the eyes of the people in Ruth.
[time=1582] Through Naomi's eyes, through Ruth's eyes, through Boaz's eyes.
[time=1585] That word sovereignty is defined in this way.
[time=1588] God is absolutely in control of all things.
[time=1591] God is sovereign, nothing happens outside his control, nothing happens that he isn't aware of.
[time=1597] This is Palm Sunday and built into our worldview.
[time=1604] If we share that view with the people of Ruth, it's Psalm 118.
[time=1608] You'll see it in just a few minutes.
[time=1610] Hosanna, Lord, save us, grant us success.
[time=1615] You know, that implies that God can, and that he's involved, and that he's paying attention to you.
[time=1621] But God is attentive.
[time=1622] Do you believe that God is attentive or that he's an old man asleep on his throne, the world spinning off its axis?
[time=1628] If someone tells you, I can never believe in a God like that.
[time=1632] A God, his old grandpa figure, he was just kind of senile and sleepy and you can say, yeah, great, me either.
[time=1639] I'll tell you about my God, but God of the Bible, whose eyes are on the sparrow, who nothing happens outside of his control.
[time=1647] I think it's gonna snow today.
[time=1649] I'm sorry, it's Palm Sunday.
[time=1651] I don't mean to be the bearer of bad tidings, but I think it's gonna snow.
[time=1654] And so let's make the best of the bad situation from Isaiah chapter one, just on this front.
[time=1659] Isaiah one verse 18 says, "Come now, "let's reason together," says the Lord, "though your sins are like scarlet, "they'll be white as snow." Do you know that snow doesn't need to be bleached or whitened, it just falls from the heavens that way?
[time=1678] So guys, when God promises to make you white as snow, that promise is a promise of a whole new nature.
[time=1685] Not just, I'll scrub up your clothes and give you this spiritual hand-me-down.
[time=1690] Here you go, but a whole new nature, that's the promise, the kind of love that he has for us.
[time=1698] And I encourage you with that this morning.
[time=1700] We are just days away from Resurrection Sunday, I cannot wait.
[time=1703] The community of faith celebrates the resurrection of Jesus
[time=1709] as the basis, as the ground of assurance that the present and the future are not under the control of blind forces, but are open to unlimited possibilities of new life.
[time=1721] This is because the living God who was present in the crucified Jesus is now and always the sovereign Lord of history and therefore makes possible a continuing struggle against all that ignores or negates that purpose.
[time=1737] You can do it, what's the application?
[time=1739] You can do it, what's it?
[time=1741] I don't know, but tomorrow won't be a surprise to him.
[time=1745] Sovereignty, God is in absolute control of all things,
[time=1751] all things, in creation, he is the king, he determines all that happens.
[time=1757] That needs to be very encouraging to you.
[time=1761] Deep down it will be.
[time=1762] I know that there are things happening in your life up here that seem chaotic and out of control, but believe that God is sovereign over all of it, even through disappointment.
[time=1772] When others disappoint you and they fail and they will and so will you.
[time=1775] Believe that God can make beautiful things, joy comes in the morning.
[time=1781] Through those ashes, he can do it.
[time=1784] You can't, he can.
[time=1786] Redemption, what a beautiful picture of that.
[time=1790] Providence, you have the definition for Providence too, we use that word as well.
[time=1796] That word redemption refers to rescue that God is at work in all things.
[time=1799] God is always personally involved with his creation.
[time=1802] So sovereignty is God up here, Providence is God right here.
[time=1806] Do you see that?
[time=1808] Insustaining and preserving it and acting within it to bring about his own perfect goals.
[time=1813] That often happens through struggle in a way that would never happen without struggle.
[time=1819] And the way when Christ calls a man, Dietrich Bonhoeffer said this, when Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die.
[time=1826] The way of the cross is the way of suffering.
[time=1830] Not just kind of this head down shoulder slump like, oh, whoa is me, but God's promise to be with you throughout all of it.
[time=1836] But it's an honest call.
[time=1840] Chapter one of Ruth, let's go back there this morning.
[time=1843] The first take away was our thesis statement for Ruth.
[time=1847] One more time, everything in our lives flows from God's good hand.
[time=1854] Sovereignly, providentially working redemption for his people.
[time=1859] Chapter one begins with famine, ends with harvest.
[time=1863] It just still happens.
[time=1865] Naomi's leaving Moab, she's going back to her home 'cause she hears that God's visited his people.
[time=1871] And a key verse here is Ruth 1, 16 of chapter one of Ruth.
[time=1875] But Ruth said, do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you for where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge.
[time=1888] Your people shall be my people and your God, my God.
[time=1893] It is not exaggeration to say that a Moabite girl's declaration of faith in God changed the world.
[time=1901] Changed the world.
[time=1904] She is not an Israelite, she is not esteemed.
[time=1907] The Moabites have a very checkered past and God takes a widow, a Moabite widow and lifts her up and exalts her in the line of Christ.
[time=1915] She's in there in Luke chapter one, Matthew one, excuse me.
[time=1918] It's so beautiful.
[time=1921] This is what God does.
[time=1922] He takes our ordinariness and makes it extraordinary.
[time=1925] He's good at it.
[time=1929] James 1, 17 says that every good gift, every perfect gift is from above.
[time=1935] Coming down from the father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.
[time=1940] Everything else in your life is due to change and variation and shadows will fall, but not him.
[time=1946] Do you believe that?
[time=1949] Believe it.
[time=1949] Live it.
[time=1951] Live it today.
[time=1951] Live it tomorrow.
[time=1953] The second takeaway, dear friends, from Ruth from chapter two is that there are no coincidences.
[time=1960] There are no coincidences.
[time=1965] G.K. Chesterton was influential in the salvation of C.S. Lewis.
[time=1972] And he wrote a book in 1922 when he came to America and he left.
[time=1976] He said, the book was called What I Saw in America.
[time=1979] He said this, "Progress is Providence without God." That is, it's a theory that everything has always perpetually gone right by accident.
[time=1988] It's a sort of atheistic optimism based on an everlasting coincidence, far more miraculous than a miracle.
[time=1998] William Temple said it this way.
[time=2004] This is really, really helpful.
[time=2005] He said, when I pray, coincidences happen.
[time=2009] When I don't, they don't.
[time=2013] I heard somebody else say that luck is when God chooses to remain anonymous.
[time=2018] Kelly is working on rubbing that word out of a vocabulary that word luck.
[time=2024] So how's that going?
[time=2024] If you say luck, hope you mean that.
[time=2027] Verse three of Luke two says this.
[time=2031] So Ruth set out and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers.
[time=2036] And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz.
[time=2042] I'll have the clan of Olimolek, her dead father-in-law.
[time=2045] Just so happens.
[time=2046] Naomi didn't dispatch Ruth to glean in Boaz's field.
[time=2052] That was a coincidence.
[time=2055] I'm struck here, friends, in some takeaways, some things to put in your pocket and take with you.
[time=2062] I'm struck that it was Ruth's diligence and her faith that caught Boaz's attention.
[time=2068] In verse four, Boaz came from Bethlehem and he said to the reapers, "The Lord be with you." And they answered, "The Lord bless you." Then Boaz said to his young man in charge of the reapers, "Who's young woman is this?" He hears the whole story.
[time=2082] And that's what's drawn, draws him in.
[time=2085] Men in the room.
[time=2087] Be the kind of man that notices and celebrates what is truly beautiful, what is within.
[time=2094] Everything in our culture is going this way, on that front.
[time=2099] Would you please help the women in your life and celebrate in them what's truly beautiful, like Boaz does?
[time=2107] That's a great example for us.
[time=2109] He described in verse one of chapter two as a worthy man.
[time=2113] Why is he a worthy man?
[time=2116] Why is he described that way?
[time=2117] He's a man of standing in the NIV.
[time=2119] Then he asked me, "He calls him a man of great wealth, but not just great wealth." These weren't just mere titles for Boaz.
[time=2128] He reveals his worthiness by his character and by his conduct.
[time=2132] He isn't just a scribed goodness.
[time=2135] It's demonstrated in what he does.
[time=2136] His station wasn't happenstance, coincidence, if you will.
[time=2141] If my epitaph only read Steve Webster,
[time=2147] a worthy man from the claim of Webster, that would be good enough for me.
[time=2152] Men, would you strive today to live your lives like that?
[time=2156] What will they say about you?
[time=2157] This could be it.
[time=2158] We are not guaranteed tomorrow.
[time=2161] May it be so, ladies.
[time=2165] I would encourage you to be the kind of woman who trusts God enough to commit your present and your feature into his hands, to pursue beauty of character.
[time=2176] Proverbs 31 in the Hebrew Bible comes right before Ruth,
[time=2184] leaving open the incredible possibility.
[time=2186] What's Proverbs 31 about?
[time=2188] Do you guys know what that chapter is about?
[time=2191] A virtuous wife, I heard lots of voices.
[time=2193] A virtuous wife.
[time=2194] Proverbs 31, following behind it is Ruth.
[time=2197] Ruth is the embodiment of Proverbs 31.
[time=2201] It's likely.
[time=2201] It is a good thing to chase after those things, ladies, and to follow Ruth's example.
[time=2207] She is the embodiment of a virtuous wife.
[time=2212] Verse 12 of Ruth 2 is a verse that Kelly settled on a few weeks ago, and I want to revisit it with you this morning.
[time=2217] Look at Ruth 2, verse 12.
[time=2219] This is Boaz.
[time=2222] "The Lord repay you for what you've done, and a full reward be given you by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge." Boaz's words are words of kindness,
[time=2239] words of comfort.
[time=2240] Our daughter is 10, and I'm still terrified that she's 10.
[time=2243] We both are.
[time=2245] I'm amazed at how my words to her can cause her face to fall,
[time=2251] or cause her chin to be up.
[time=2255] Men, you have incredible power with your kids, with your wife, you do more than you realize.
[time=2261] Six in the stones may break my bones, but words will, that's a lie.
[time=2265] It's still a lie today.
[time=2268] Boaz's words are words of kindness and comfort, and I would encourage you to let your words be that into people in your life.
[time=2275] Naomi later on recognizes that the kindness and comfort from Boaz, in verse 20 of chapter 2, you can look at it, is from God.
[time=2284] The God is showing his comfort and kindness to them through Boaz.
[time=2288] He's using ordinary people like us to do this.
[time=2294] Psalm 17, 8 says this.
[time=2296] It says, keep me as the apple of your eye.
[time=2299] Hide me in the shadow of your wings.
[time=2303] This is a great picture.
[time=2305] The apple of your eye, you know, is the pupil right in there.
[time=2310] And the picture there in the Hebrew is of a little maiden.
[time=2313] Keep me as the little maiden of your eye.
[time=2316] What's that mean?
[time=2317] It means that she's so close that you can see her in the reflection of your eyeball.
[time=2321] Hold me closely.
[time=2324] This love that God offers us, you guys, is extravagant.
[time=2327] It's not just you can make it.
[time=2329] You'll be all right on you go.
[time=2331] The Psalmist says, God, keep me as the apple of your eye.
[time=2335] Love me like this.
[time=2337] Isn't just the best option.
[time=2342] Isn't just the best of many choices.
[time=2345] That's not how God offers himself to us.
[time=2346] It's the only way to navigate the world around this.
[time=2350] The only way hardship, difficulty, strife, struggle, heartbreak.
[time=2354] John Piper said it this way.
[time=2357] In the end, one must finally come to see that if there is a God in heaven,
[time=2364] there is no such thing as mere coincidence, not even the smallest affairs of life.
[time=2369] The lot is cast into the lap, but it's every decision is of the Lord.
[time=2374] Not one sparrow will fall to the ground apart from your father.
[time=2380] This is the Bible's picture of what God is like and his involvement in our lives.
[time=2383] And it is marvelously encouraging if you will see it, if you will open your eyes to see.
[time=2388] Second takeaway again was that there are no coincidences.
[time=2393] The third takeaway is this.
[time=2394] God is making his appeal through us.
[time=2401] I don't know why he is, but he is.
[time=2404] It's the show that his also passing power is from God and not really from us.
[time=2409] I know that, but wow, I could have chosen better than me, someone to make an appeal.
[time=2417] 2 Corinthians 5 says this.
[time=2419] These verses are astonishing.
[time=2423] From now on then, we regard no one according to the flesh like Boaz did not.
[time=2430] Boaz didn't see Ruth and see Moabitis.
[time=2435] He saw Ruth and said, you've been kind to your mother-in-law, period.
[time=2439] You didn't see race?
[time=2441] You didn't see socioeconomic background?
[time=2444] There was nothing in it for Boaz, you guys.
[time=2446] Nothing in it for Boaz.
[time=2448] He was a worthy man, a man of great wealth and influence and prosperity, and Ruth is a Moabite widow.
[time=2453] And he sets his affection on her, not because he will make his life better.
[time=2460] The near kinsmen in chapter 4 says, "Land okay, but Ruth, no thanks." Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh,
[time=2471] we regard him thus no longer.
[time=2473] Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[time=2477] Not like a new creation is a new creation.
[time=2481] The old has passed away, but hold the new has come.
[time=2485] All this is from God.
[time=2488] Who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.
[time=2494] That is, in Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself.
[time=2499] God was doing the one thing that needed to happen in such a way that it never happened again.
[time=2505] Not counting their trespasses against them.
[time=2509] How good is that?
[time=2511] That is really good news, because mine are a mile long.
[time=2516] He doesn't count them against me.
[time=2518] Can you imagine?
[time=2520] Oh, friends, entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.
[time=2526] Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ.
[time=2528] God making his appeal through us.
[time=2530] We implore you on behalf of Christ.
[time=2533] Be reconciled to God.
[time=2534] I beg you, on behalf of us, my voice, be reconciled to God.
[time=2540] The only way you can is to do what Christ has already done.
[time=2543] He knows that you can't do it good enough.
[time=2546] You don't have to stop trying.
[time=2548] Rest easy.
[time=2549] Rest in his finished work.
[time=2552] When Christ hung on that cross, he said it was finished and he meant it.
[time=2557] Finished.
[time=2559] Boaz and his work, his effort on behalf of weak, helpless people,
[time=2567] is a picture of the greater story, redemption, rescue that we're all called into.
[time=2574] God was not, and he is not bound to act towards with kindness and goodness and grace, but he does freely.
[time=2581] In verse nine, we read these words from Ruth of Boaz.
[time=2590] She said, "I am Ruth, your servant.
[time=2593] Spread your wings over your servant, for you are a redeemer.
[time=2596] Hide me in the shadow of your wings." Boaz is the embodiment of God's character.
[time=2604] Wow.
[time=2605] First takeaway from Ruth was that everything in our lives flows from God's good hand,
[time=2613] who's sovereignly and prudentially works redemption for his people.
[time=2616] The second takeaway was there are no coincidences.
[time=2618] God is sovereign.
[time=2621] Third takeaway was this.
[time=2623] God's making his appeal through us.
[time=2624] So tell the story.
[time=2625] Regard no one according to the flesh.
[time=2629] Believe that God made them in his image.
[time=2632] Every person you've ever met will live forever.
[time=2636] The fourth and final one is this.
[time=2639] There is no substitute for obedience.
[time=2644] This is last week from Kelly.
[time=2645] Things in the past have a way of seeming inevitable.
[time=2649] Like, oh, yeah, that certainly would have happened.
[time=2652] But they're not inevitable.
[time=2654] They're inevitable to us because I can read about it here.
[time=2656] Like Boaz is bound to be obedient and gracious and all but he's not.
[time=2662] Others around him, you'll notice, weren't.
[time=2664] He was.
[time=2666] Don't make the mistake of explaining away things that were very hard for somebody else because they're not hard for you.
[time=2673] First John chapter five, verses two and three.
[time=2678] By this, we know that we love the children of God when we love God and obey his commandments.
[time=2688] For this is the love of God that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not burdensome.
[time=2695] His commandments are not burdensome.
[time=2698] How wonderful is that too?
[time=2700] Friends, if God only said, obey me, I can't and so I'll fall short.
[time=2708] And so my life would be an endless cycle of despair.
[time=2712] If God only said, I will offer grace to you, in respect to obedience, then my life would be meaningless.
[time=2717] Then my behavior wouldn't matter.
[time=2720] He wouldn't hold me to account for what I've done.
[time=2721] That wouldn't be best either, but he offers both, a two-handed God who offers both to us.
[time=2727] He expects obedience, he offers grace.
[time=2729] He knows that you can't do it and you don't have to because somebody else did.
[time=2733] And this Friday is what we celebrate in that.
[time=2737] And it wasn't the end, the grave could not contain him.
[time=2742] The grave was swallowed up in victory already.
[time=2745] This is the gospel, this is the good news, it's why it's good news.
[time=2749] God expects obedience, but he offers grace.
[time=2751] And everybody within the sound of my voice, young and old, from every tribe, believe it.
[time=2758] Grace means more, far more than we can put into words,
[time=2766] because it means nothing less than the infinite character of God himself.
[time=2771] It includes mercy for the undeserving and unmerciful,
[time=2777] help for the helpless and hopeless, redemption for the renegade and repulsive,
[time=2784] love for the unloving and unlovely, kindness for the unkind and unthankful.
[time=2789] And all this in full measure and overflowing abundance because of nothing in the object
[time=2795] and everything in the giver in God himself.
[time=2802] Shakespeare said that love is not love which alters when an alteration finds.
[time=2808] I'll love you just as long as it's not love.
[time=2812] That isn't the picture of love that God has for us.
[time=2815] As the band comes up to the stage, I love to sing in response to what God has done.
[time=2820] I found this poem this week that will end Ruth and this is the story of Ruth for and
[time=2829] what happens there. And it will be our prayer, it will be our takeaway,
[time=2835] it will be what I'll leave you with this morning.
[time=2837] I implore you on behalf of Christ.
[time=2842] Be reconciled to God.
[time=2844] Everything we've said in Ruth would be a waste if you left today and we're not reconciled to God.
[time=2850] Kelly and I will be down here after the service.
[time=2852] I'm sure others will be too that would love to talk with you about what that means.
[time=2857] And so as soon as light shone on the low gate leading into Bethlehem, I, Boas, gathered elders into them, laid out my case.
[time=2866] And to the head whose right preceded mine, I said, Naomi's land is yours.
[time=2871] Declame?
[time=2872] You marry Ruth and keep the name of Melon, Ruth's first husband, in your line.
[time=2877] Declare your will for I am next and swear that I will take her if you can't.
[time=2882] I wondered how the Lord would grant the longing of my heart.
[time=2887] And by another providence comply with Ruth's appeal and my desire.
[time=2891] And then I learned, he said, acquire it for yourself.
[time=2896] The land I would have had for it's very good.
[time=2898] But Ruth, she's a mellow bite.
[time=2900] And we are Jews, it isn't right.
[time=2903] The land is yours and Melon's name for what it's worth and Ruth and shame.
[time=2909] He took his shoe and gave it to me in the gate.
[time=2913] I turned and threw it out to Ruth among the crowd.
[time=2917] She caught it like a wreath and bowed.
[time=2919] I quieted the shouts and cried, what do you think of this, my bride?
[time=2922] And she replied, I think the Lord has fought today.
[time=2926] And with his sword has stuck a sign up on the gate and hum on it our wedding date.
[time=2932] As for the badge of shame you tell, the line of Judah bears it well.
[time=2936] And will for generations yet to come.
[time=2939] The book of Moses set me free.
[time=2941] There is a mercy in the law of God beyond my skin.
[time=2946] By faith God makes a person right.
[time=2948] Be she a Jew or a mellow bite.
[time=2952] Oh God, she was a rock of truth.
[time=2955] Ignite in us the faith of Ruth.
[time=2976] Let's sing this together.
