[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] What a great thrill for us to be able to bring to you this broadcast of all the broadcasts we do all year long, each and every week.
[time=42] This is by far the greatest week of our year.
[time=45] The great celebration of the resurrection is something that we look forward to.
[time=50] We look forward to it, obviously, because of the personal meaning it has for those of us who have fully surrendered our hearts and lives to Christ.
[time=59] But it's also something we look forward to because we get to share this great message with thousands of you in our broadcast and viewing audience.
[time=69] I hope you'll listen today.
[time=71] I hope that in a special way, you'll open your heart and allow the truth of God's word.
[time=77] Not so much my words or our efforts.
[time=80] My hope is that you'll allow the truth of God's word to enter into your heart and mind and life right where you are today and allow it to move you toward the great hope and forgiveness found in our resurrected Lord.
[time=95] Thank you for being a part of our family.
[time=97] Thank you for viewing each and every week.
[time=99] If you're new to the Bible Hour, my hope is and our desire has always been that while you may enjoy the broadcast, we'd love to meet you in person.
[time=108] I have met so many individuals and families over the last six months who started watching the Bible Hour and now come through these doors every single week and join us live and in person.
[time=121] And we're enjoying connecting them to the life and the ministry of Black Hawk and we would love to connect you as well.
[time=128] So come and be with us.
[time=130] We'd love to meet you nine and 1045 each and every Sunday.
[time=134] And our hope is that you will enjoy in a special way this Sunday.
[time=138] God bless you.
[time=139] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=141] Happy Resurrection Sunday and what a great truth that he is alive, that he has risen and death has no sting.
[time=149] God bless.
[time=150] [MUSIC - 251 seconds]
[time=406] (audience applauding)
[time=416] - Wow, so good to be together.
[time=421] What a great, great morning.
[time=423] What a great celebration.
[time=424] I wanna jump right into it if we can, I got this from my good friend, our teaching pastor, Steve Webster, passed this along to me this week.
[time=433] I read it and tears just fill my eyes immediately.
[time=437] Steve and I, both and many of us here on our team and many of you in the room would agree with this statement.
[time=443] But I wanted to begin the morning with this and just dwell on it for a moment.
[time=446] It says this, it says I've invested everything in,
[time=452] staked everything on, entrusted everything to the historical fact of the empty tomb of Jesus.
[time=462] And I want to read that to you this morning and I wanted you to see it because I hope that you can say that this morning.
[time=471] And I want you to know that I am saying that and I have for years said that.
[time=477] But just seeing it all there in a little short paragraph was really, really encouraging.
[time=482] I want you to know that I stand here and many of you know me.
[time=485] I'm no different than you.
[time=487] I have the most amazing privilege of a job you could ever imagine.
[time=492] I actually get paid for doing this, but we all put our pants and shoes on the same way.
[time=497] You know, I struggle just like you do in the very same areas.
[time=501] We are a family and we are in this together.
[time=503] And I've been around for a few years.
[time=506] I've been in ministry for 26.
[time=508] I've heard it all.
[time=510] I've seen it all and I want you to know that I stand here this morning, me, and I have invested everything in the empty tomb.
[time=519] I have given that truth and its implication my entire life.
[time=525] I have invested all of my time.
[time=528] I have invested all of my talent, the little bit that God has given me.
[time=533] I've invested all of my treasure.
[time=534] I have invested all of my entire being in the reality of that statement, the empty tomb, that which we celebrate this morning.
[time=544] I have staked everything on the empty tomb of Jesus.
[time=549] I have staked my name.
[time=551] I have staked my future.
[time=553] I have staked my reputation.
[time=555] I am, I'll say it to you again.
[time=558] I am a Christ follower.
[time=560] Don't call me a pastor.
[time=563] Don't call me a church attender.
[time=565] Don't call me a member.
[time=566] Don't call me anything other than a follower of Jesus Christ who I believe is alive and well today because the tomb is empty.
[time=576] I've invested everything in.
[time=580] I have staked everything on.
[time=581] And this is the part that really got me when I read it.
[time=583] I've entrusted everything to it.
[time=587] And when I think about what I have entrusted, my mind goes to my family.
[time=595] I have entrusted my wife and my five kids to the person and the name and the reality of Jesus Christ and his empty tomb.
[time=605] I try to, I don't do it well all the time but I try to point them to him every day.
[time=611] I don't point my kids to Buddha.
[time=616] I don't point my kids to hedonism and the pursuit of pleasure.
[time=621] I don't point my kids to money.
[time=622] I don't point my family toward pleasure.
[time=625] I don't point them to anything or anyone other than the person and work and empty tomb of Jesus Christ.
[time=634] I've entrusted them, the ones I love the most in this life to him.
[time=639] I've invested everything, staked everything on and trusted everything and everyone to the historical fact of the empty tomb of Jesus and hallelujah, it's true.
[time=649] And I pray to God that you can do the very same thing.
[time=652] Amen?
[time=654] I was 10 years old, and there I am in all my glory.
[time=658] It was 1973 and most of my life was simple
[time=664] and carefree, sports, school, parents that loved me
[time=670] and no real worries at all.
[time=672] Some really big ears but no real worries, no real worries at all.
[time=677] But there actually was one, there actually was one periodic and confusing heartache
[time=684] in my 10 year old world.
[time=686] I've introduced him to you before, I wanna introduce him to you again.
[time=689] He was my dear, much admired grandpa Joe.
[time=693] Joe Jackson, one of my heroes.
[time=697] I loved and admired my grandfather.
[time=699] He was, I learned at the age of 10, something my mom and dad called an alcoholic.
[time=705] I was 10 and I didn't know what an alcoholic was.
[time=710] What I did know was that sometimes he was there for Christmas and sometimes he wasn't.
[time=716] Sometimes he came to my birthday parties and then some years he didn't, I was 10.
[time=721] It was all very, very confusing.
[time=724] Sometimes he'd be loud and funny and sometimes he was quiet and withdrawn but by far the hardest times were the times when his darkness would settle and when the battle with past demons would overpower his spirit and inevitably he'd just leave.
[time=738] For weeks and weeks, months and months at a time he would simply be gone.
[time=743] One day at the staggering end of a multiple month bender, he showed up in the town we lived in and on a hot summer night in 1973, I heard, I saw and I experienced for the first time ever in my young life the depth and despair of human pain.
[time=765] With real wisdom and love, my dad tried to help my grandpa
[time=771] that night, he drove him to an old motel on the edge of town, told me to stay in the car while he literally carried my grandpa to a ground level room on the far back corner of the empty property and began the long excruciating vigil known as detox.
[time=787] My dad was going to try and help grandpa dry out.
[time=792] He was going to pray with him, wrestle with him, literally, plead with him and bargain with him in an effort to keep him in that room and away from the booze that had taken away his life, scarred his soul and destroyed his days.
[time=808] We had arrived at the motel around noon and at eight, nine o'clock that night, my dad was ready to run me home but I wouldn't leave.
[time=816] You see, I loved my grandpa more than anyone knew and I was proud of my dad's efforts and promised my dad I would stay in the car, sit tight, not go anywhere, I'd just sleep in the back seat of the car and not get in the way.
[time=830] My dad, with hesitation, let me stay.
[time=833] And in the middle of the night, around four o'clock in the morning, I awoke to the sound of wailing screams and crying convulsions that not only echoed over an entire parking lot and filled every corner in corridor of that old motel but they filled as well, a 10-year-old heart and mind that today some 40 years later remembers the very words that were being screamed in the early morning darkness.
[time=860] I'm so thirsty.
[time=865] Ed, my dad, Ed, please let me drink.
[time=872] Oh God, he cried out, let me die.
[time=878] I'm so thirsty.
[time=882] Ed, please let me drink.
[time=884] Oh God, let me die.
[time=887] And in John chapter six,
[time=896] beginning in verse 32, it says this.
[time=900] Jesus said to them, truly, truly, I say to you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven but it is my father who gives you the true bread out of heaven.
[time=914] For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, Jesus said here and gives life to the world.
[time=921] Then they said to him, Lord, give us the spread, always.
[time=927] Lord, give us the spread.
[time=928] And then Jesus says these words in John six, 35.
[time=932] Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life.
[time=937] He who comes to me will not hunger and he who believes in me will never thirst.
[time=946] What I know now, but didn't know then, was that my grandpa while crying out for a drink really, truly needed something to eat.
[time=956] While he cried out for booze, what he really down deep inside needed was the bread, the bread of life, the bread that would, according to the scripture this morning, bring absolute and ultimate satisfaction.
[time=974] He needed the bread of life and the truth is many of us in this room this morning.
[time=979] Many of us in this room this morning need it, need it desperately.
[time=984] What would you say if I told you this morning that Easter is the cure for hunger?
[time=989] That's what I'm saying.
[time=992] I'm proclaiming to you this morning on Resurrection Sunday that Easter is the cure for hunger.
[time=998] What would you say if I told you that the Resurrection of Jesus makes available the only remedy for both the hunger and thirst in your soul?
[time=1007] It's true, the Resurrection of Jesus Christ represents the only remedy for both the hunger and thirst in your soul.
[time=1016] And I am talking this morning, let's be clear on this.
[time=1018] I'm talking this morning to all souls in this room and those of you who are watching online.
[time=1024] I'm talking to your hungry and thirsty, distant from God, don't come to church very often, soul.
[time=1033] And I'm talking, and I'm talking to your hungry and thirsty, I'm here every week and still wander toward that which does not satisfy soul.
[time=1047] You see, the truth of today's Easter message isn't just for those who may have wandered in for the first or second time this year, a lot of times I think people think that.
[time=1060] They think we Christians get geared up for Easter and we're gonna save all you folks who come every once in a while.
[time=1066] Oh, please understand, it couldn't be further from the truth because the truth of the matter is that in every single person in this room this morning, there is a lot of grandpa Joe in you and a lot of grandpa Joe in me, in each and every one of us, there tends to be a crying out from the soul that needs to be reminded today, that there is a choice you can make and there is a direction that you can go.
[time=1092] There is some food, some bread that you can eat that brings a level of satisfaction and brings a level of meaning that you've never known.
[time=1102] And so let's look at our passage this morning, would you join me and stand in honor of God's word?
[time=1107] Let me read to you this morning, John 635, 36 and 37.
[time=1113] John 635, it says, Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life, he who comes to me will not hunger and he who believes in me will never thirst.
[time=1124] But I say to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe and all that the Father gives me will come to me and the one who comes to me, I will certainly not cast out.
[time=1141] Here you go, Jesus tells you three things.
[time=1143] He tells you three things this morning and these three verses, he says that you're hungry.
[time=1148] He says that to every one of you this morning, that you're hungry.
[time=1152] He says that you're stubborn in your hunger.
[time=1157] He says you're stubborn and thirdly he says, I'm merciful, you're hungry, you're stubborn and then Jesus says to you this morning, I'm merciful and I can't wait for you and I to discover the truths that are wrapped up in those three points.
[time=1172] Father in heaven, we gather this morning to celebrate the resurrection of your Son, God.
[time=1176] We gather this morning to again here, your life-changing word.
[time=1180] Oh God, we pray that it would do that, that it would change us and we thank you.
[time=1185] We thank you for the privilege of being here and we thank you for the great opportunity to hear from you as it relates to that which stirs deep in our souls, deep in our lives.
[time=1197] Oh God, may we have years to hear, may our hearts be open.
[time=1202] We ask in your Son's name, amen.
[time=1205] Amen, you can be seated.
[time=1206] So he says in verse 35, you're filled with an emptiness that leaves you wanting and grasping.
[time=1214] You're filled with this emptiness that leaves you hungry and in need.
[time=1219] He says in 36 that everything you're wanting and grasping for is found in me and he reminds them and you and me this morning that he's right here.
[time=1230] He says you keep everything you're grasping for, everything you're going after.
[time=1234] He says is found in me and I'm right here and the text would indicate and you know it.
[time=1241] You know I'm right here and yet you keep standing in the wrong line.
[time=1247] You keep going to the wrong places in your brokenness and your desperateness.
[time=1251] You keep lining up to get something that you think is going to meet you at that place and it doesn't and so the hunger is perpetuated.
[time=1260] You're hungry, you're stubborn and he says in 37 if you'll come to me, I'll alter the consequences.
[time=1267] There are consequences for your stubbornness as it relates to the bread of life and the choices that you make.
[time=1278] He says I'll alter that.
[time=1279] I won't do to you what I should do.
[time=1285] It's called mercy, we'll get there.
[time=1286] Verse 35, let's start there, you're hungry.
[time=1289] You're hungry.
[time=1290] I am the bread of life, he says.
[time=1293] John 635, he who comes to me will not hunger.
[time=1298] The very grammar of the sentence implies the presence of hunger, of a very real hunger that has occurred or settled in to the heart and soul of a person.
[time=1310] I think it's important that we recognize this morning where this hunger has come from.
[time=1315] Do you know, do you know where the hunger in your soul comes from, do you know where it started?
[time=1322] Do you understand how this whole thing originated?
[time=1326] Bible gives us the answer, it does.
[time=1327] Turn back in your Bibles to Genesis chapter two.
[time=1330] Everybody, just take your Bible, go back to the very beginning of this deal, the whole start of the redemptive story of God.
[time=1337] Genesis two, I want you to look at verse 15, here's where we begin to see and understand the way hunger played into the original plan of God.
[time=1347] Genesis two, 15.
[time=1348] Then the Lord God, it says there in verse 15.
[time=1351] Then the Lord God took the man and put him, he had created Adam, now he puts him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it.
[time=1358] Then 16, here it is.
[time=1359] The Lord God commanded the man saying, from any tree of the garden, you may what?
[time=1365] Say the word, you eat because you're what?
[time=1371] Say it, hungry.
[time=1374] So from the very beginning, it was okay that we were hungry.
[time=1380] From the very beginning, what we see is that God provided trees from which we could eat to satisfy our hunger, verse 16.
[time=1391] From any tree of the garden, you may eat freely, but from verse 17, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it, your hunger won't be satisfied, no, in fact, you'll die.
[time=1406] It's what happens when you go outside the parameter
[time=1413] of what God in his perfect will lovingly has provided you.
[time=1418] He has lovingly provided you, Genesis two, 16, a way for your hunger.
[time=1424] See, what we learn here is that it's not a sin to be hungry, the sin comes in what you do or where you go with the hunger.
[time=1434] He designed you to be hungry.
[time=1436] He says, I want you to eat, eat what I've provided.
[time=1444] You're going to want to eat, eat what I have given.
[time=1448] I've given you every tree to eat from that you'd ever need to eat from.
[time=1451] I made you, designed you to experience emptiness.
[time=1456] That was the way God designed us and emptiness that would be filled absolutely and thoroughly in our relationship and in our interaction with and in our going to him.
[time=1470] It's not the emptiness, that's the problem.
[time=1473] It's where we go with it and oh my goodness, what a problem it became.
[time=1476] So Satan in the form of the serpent, many of you know how this played out.
[time=1480] So Satan in the form of the serpent comes along and what I want you to see in ponder today is that the great deceiver and destroyer, Satan himself, chooses the issue of hunger.
[time=1491] He didn't choose sex, he didn't choose money, he didn't choose power.
[time=1495] He could have chosen anything he wanted.
[time=1497] Satan chooses to hone in on the issue of hunger.
[time=1502] The single most important human need.
[time=1511] Satan chooses eating to birth sin and separate man from God.
[time=1519] Genesis three, verse one.
[time=1524] Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said to the woman, indeed has God said, you shall not what?
[time=1535] Say it, eat from any tree of the garden.
[time=1539] The woman said to the serpent from the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden.
[time=1547] God has said, you shall not eat from it or touch it or you will die.
[time=1551] The serpent said to the woman, that's ridiculous.
[time=1556] The serpent said to the woman the same thing, the serpent says to you, it's the very same thing the serpent says to me, it's the very same whisper or shout that you hear in your ear that I hear in mine on a daily and regular basis.
[time=1574] What God has commanded, what God has provided, all the trees by which you are to receive satisfaction.
[time=1584] Satan says to you and me, Satan says to Eve, that's ridiculous.
[time=1590] How narrow minded, how controlling, how boring.
[time=1597] Right there in the text, he just goes right for the jugular and says, surely you will not die.
[time=1605] For God knows that in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God knowing good and evil.
[time=1611] When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was desirable, which most sin is.
[time=1622] Think about your sin, I'll think about mine here just for a moment, you think about the way in which the enemy comes to you, you think about the circumstances you're in and the quietness and privacy of your own world or maybe it's even out in public, but you and I both know that the sin you and I are tempted with today, it's a delight to the eyes, it was desirable to make one wise,
[time=1646] good for food, it's all right there.
[time=1654] And she took from its fruit and ate and she gave also to her husband with her and he ate hunger, food, eating.
[time=1662] Here it is and the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked, they were embarrassed, they were ashamed and they sewed fig leaves together
[time=1678] and made themselves loin coverings.
[time=1682] Do you think about it all through the history of the scriptures, all through the story of God's redemptive interactions with man, there's been this issue of what God has provided and what man wanted.
[time=1693] You think about this issue of food, you think about the people of Israel, you read the story of the people of Israel and they're wandering in the desert and they say, we're hungry, so God says fine, I'm gonna give you trees from which to eat, I'm gonna give you this thing called manna.
[time=1707] So God provides for them what they need, God provides for them in the way that God designed it, God gives them manna, they eat manna and just like you and just like me, after a while of doing what God designed they said, you know what, we want something else.
[time=1722] We wanna go outside of what God has provided as if what God has provided isn't enough.
[time=1728] And so they go outside, God judges them,
[time=1735] God deals with them harshly, I think it was through quail it got really ugly, it got really sad, it got, it was bad.
[time=1742] It always is when you go outside of what God designed.
[time=1745] I think about Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego, Daniel, one, these young boys, hijacked, kidnapped, out of Israel away from their families a thousand miles over to Babylon and this crazed, maniacal king, this guy named Nebuchadnezzar and he's a smart dude and he knows that God with his people had established this food thing.
[time=1770] He knew that God had established with these boys this way of living life that while there were a lot of parameters, one of them was what they ate.
[time=1780] So he tries to change their diet.
[time=1783] He says, I'm gonna feed you something different and on the food front, on the where you go to eat front.
[time=1790] Daniel says, not a chance, you know, kill me now.
[time=1795] I am not going to eat your food, I am going to eat what God has provided for me to eat.
[time=1803] It's all through the scripture.
[time=1807] This issue of food, this issue of the bread, this issue of what God has provided and because Adam and Eve went to the wrong line, because Adam and Eve went to the wrong tree, we've been hungry ever since the Garden of Eden.
[time=1822] You've been hungry, I've been hungry and in our sinful stubbornness, we've been going after bread that never really meets our need.
[time=1830] What bread, what bread are you going after?
[time=1835] That doesn't really meet your need.
[time=1838] We were talking about it first hour, a good way to just kind of help you think about this as difficult, as hard as it might be to think about.
[time=1847] I want you to think about it this morning.
[time=1849] Here's how it usually surfaces.
[time=1854] You're angry, you're really angry.
[time=1857] Something's gone really wrong and in your anger, you feel like doing this might make you feel better.
[time=1866] In your stress or your pressure or you being kind of fed up with things, looking at or watching this might make you feel better.
[time=1876] You're tired of him, you're sick of her, you're weary of the hassle and so by going to this or by going over to that, somehow maybe in your mind, you think you're gonna feel better.
[time=1892] If this or that is anything other than the bread of life,
[time=1899] if it's control, if it's pornography,
[time=1908] if it's an illicit relationship, if it's the God of laziness, if it's hedonism, if it's your pursuit of pleasure, if it's wealth, whatever it is, that in your heartache, trouble, anger, stress, pressure, you default to, if that is anything other than him, you're in trouble, we're in trouble.
[time=1935] 'Cause we're going to the wrong tree.
[time=1938] We're going to the wrong line.
[time=1939] We're rejecting the bread of life.
[time=1943] We don't need to belabor the point much more.
[time=1948] We're all in this room and those of you watching really, really hungry and it shows.
[time=1952] It's not hard to notice.
[time=1955] Back to John 6 in our outline, Jesus says you're hungry and secondly, Jesus says you're stubborn.
[time=1961] You see what it says there?
[time=1963] In John 6, go back to where we were, John 6, 36, he says, he says, but I said to you that you have seen me.
[time=1975] He could say the same thing to many of you.
[time=1978] He certainly could say the same thing to me.
[time=1979] He says you have seen me.
[time=1980] You've watched, he says to them, you've watched what I've done.
[time=1983] You've heard what I've said.
[time=1985] You've traveled with me.
[time=1987] You've observed the way I live my life.
[time=1989] You've seen that I'm from the Father.
[time=1991] You've seen the lives that have been transformed.
[time=1994] You've seen the healings that have occurred.
[time=1996] You've seen me and yet do not believe.
[time=1998] It's about maybe eight, nine o'clock in the morning
[time=2008] back at the motel.
[time=2011] I don't know how, but I had eventually fallen asleep.
[time=2015] And about eight or nine in the morning, my dad gets in the car, I wake up, I hop in the front seat.
[time=2021] He says, come on buddy, we gotta go.
[time=2023] I said, Dan, where we going, where's Grandpa?
[time=2026] What are we doing?
[time=2027] He says, but it's, we've done what we can do.
[time=2030] It's time to go home.
[time=2031] I'm gonna just ask you to come with me.
[time=2032] And so I got in the front seat, buckled in and off we went.
[time=2036] And as we're driving, I could tell, I could sense, I could see in my own dad's eyes and his countenance, this deep sense of disappointment.
[time=2043] I knew the effort that he had made.
[time=2045] I knew all that had been put on the table.
[time=2048] There to help and to come alongside my Grandpa.
[time=2051] And as we drove, he didn't say much.
[time=2053] And we're coming through this small town where we lived.
[time=2055] We're coming through town at the end of town, we'll make a ride and go up to the road where our house was.
[time=2059] And about halfway through town, right there at a stoplight, no kidding.
[time=2062] In the passenger seat, looking out the window, there's the bus station.
[time=2066] And there's my Grandpa, sitting on a bench.
[time=2071] Shoulders and head just drooped.
[time=2075] Waiting for a ride to nowhere.
[time=2082] He had looked my dad in the eye and they had literally wrestled and they had literally fought and they had literally, dad had begged and he finally just said, get out of my face, get out of my way.
[time=2096] And off he went.
[time=2097] There's a stubbornness sometimes in us
[time=2104] that even when it's right in front of you, Jesus said, I'm right here.
[time=2111] You see me, you know me.
[time=2113] And yet there is this invitation to keep searching,
[time=2119] to keep going after that, which ultimately leaves us empty.
[time=2124] He says, you're hungry and he says, you're stubborn.
[time=2128] And then Jesus says the words that breathe life and hope and to every sin-stained heart that hears them.
[time=2133] He says, thirdly, I'm merciful.
[time=2135] I'm merciful.
[time=2137] As stubborn as you are, I am merciful.
[time=2139] And all that the Father gives me will come to me.
[time=2142] And the one who comes to me, I will certainly not cast out.
[time=2147] You see, mercy, oh, I hope you'll hear this
[time=2153] and I know many in the room, you'll resonate with this because I know there are many of you in the room this morning who, like me, have experienced times and seasons of stubbornness.
[time=2163] And I want to remind you this morning that mercy is exactly what stubborn people need.
[time=2170] Mercy is exactly what stubborn people need.
[time=2175] Have you ever just been, I'm asking you, have you ever just been blown away by an act of mercy?
[time=2180] As your husband, as your wife, have your parents,
[time=2186] have good, honest, Christ-following friends, extended, have you ever received mercy at a level that just absolutely boggles your mind?
[time=2197] Many of you, I know, have been that stubborn.
[time=2203] Just real quick back on stubbornness.
[time=2205] You know what a definition of stubborn is, don't you?
[time=2208] Here's a good one for you, write this down.
[time=2209] Here's a great definition of stubbornness.
[time=2213] Stubbornness is hard-hearted.
[time=2218] Stubbornness is, I'm gonna do this my way.
[time=2223] You know your stubborn when all of a sudden you're the expert, when all of a sudden you're the one that knows the most.
[time=2228] You're the one who's got it figured out.
[time=2231] No other options, no other inputs, just you.
[time=2234] Stubbornness is hard-hearted, my way, fingers.
[time=2239] This is, everybody put your fingers in your ears, or close if it grosses you out, sorry.
[time=2244] Everybody just put your fingers in here, right there.
[time=2246] Hard-hearted, my way, and I'm not listening.
[time=2250] You can put them down.
[time=2252] Hard-hearted, I don't feel anymore.
[time=2255] Stubborn people get to this point where they don't even feel anymore.
[time=2259] They're detached from their feelings because they've listened to so many lies and gone so far down these roads.
[time=2267] Hard-hearted, I don't feel anymore.
[time=2269] It's my way, I don't care anymore.
[time=2272] It's fingers in your ears, I don't listen.
[time=2275] And I wanna ask you this morning as Corbin makes his way back up and as we prepare to worship and respond this morning, I wanna ask you this, where has your stubbornness gotten you?
[time=2289] Please, we got a few minutes left here today.
[time=2295] I'm just hoping and asking that you would exercise some real integrity in your heart, some real sincerity.
[time=2303] As you think this through this morning between you and the Lord, where has your stubbornness gotten you?
[time=2310] And don't forget I'm talking to everybody here.
[time=2313] I'm talking to those of you who are hungry and thirsty and not here very often.
[time=2322] Where has your propensity to with those longings and those stirrings that you feel inside, that emptiness in that hunger, in your tendency to go to places that God hasn't designed for you and your stubbornness to hang on to what you think is best.
[time=2350] Where has that road led?
[time=2353] What's it like for you to be there in that place?
[time=2359] The Bible says that a stubborn hardheartedness leads to an old run down bus stop.
[time=2366] That's where it leads.
[time=2369] The Bible says that stubborn hardheartedness leads to brokenness, to shame, to guilt, mountains of guilt and regret and sorrow and loneliness.
[time=2390] The Bible says that stubborn hardheartedness leads to the unavoidable ripple effect and consequence of your sin.
[time=2400] And ultimately, ultimately, left to yourself on your own
[time=2408] if that's where you choose to stay.
[time=2413] It leads to an eternity separated from God
[time=2419] in the pain and darkness of having done it your way.
[time=2424] But today, today, my friends, because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the words and promises of Jesus have been validated.
[time=2437] Easter means that John six is true.
[time=2441] He is the bread of life and he offers your stubborn heart mercy.
[time=2449] Then he offers you himself a bread.
[time=2455] According to scripture, a bread that deals with your hunger and your thirst.
[time=2460] He won't cast you out and please hear me.
[time=2466] We without apology and without hesitation, we stand here this morning and we proclaim that part of the truth as well.
[time=2475] But if you chose to sass for some reason, go this thing alone.
[time=2480] If you choose to continue to try and find life and meaning and fulfillment outside of what he has provided, you'll be cast out.
[time=2490] You will spend not only eternity,
[time=2496] but you are today in hell.
[time=2499] You say, what are you talking about?
[time=2502] Hell's just an in game, hell's an in game.
[time=2506] But now you see, I've been around long enough.
[time=2510] Now I've lived long enough.
[time=2511] Now I've seen enough started when I was 10.
[time=2513] And I know that there's hell on earth.
[time=2516] There is, there is hell on earth.
[time=2520] And it is life apart from God.
[time=2523] It is life stuck in the depths of your loneliness and your shame and your guilt and your sorrow and your emptiness.
[time=2533] And he says, you know what?
[time=2535] I'm gonna take all that away.
[time=2537] I'm gonna be merciful to you, you hungry, stubborn person.
[time=2543] If you'll come to me, it says it right there.
[time=2547] If you come to me, I'll give you bread.
[time=2550] If you believe in me, I'll solve your thirst.
[time=2554] If you would, just take a moment and bow your heads.
[time=2558] Close your eyes, I wanna just read scripture if I can over you this morning.
[time=2564] Allow the truth of God's word to penetrate your heart and soul in whatever way it needs to.
[time=2568] Oh, I pray that you'll let it move you this morning.
[time=2571] It says in Isaiah 55, it says, oh, in the original language,
[time=2579] it would mean stop, oh, everyone who thirsts,
[time=2585] come to the waters, and you who have no money come by and eat, come by wine and milk without money and without cost.
[time=2595] Why, Isaiah 55, too?
[time=2597] Why do you spend money for what is not bread?
[time=2602] And you're wages for what does not satisfy?
[time=2610] Listen carefully to me and eat what is good and delight yourself in abundance, incline verse three, incline your ear and come to me.
[time=2622] And so Jesus, our resurrected Lord,
[time=2628] who's defeat of death, we celebrate this morning.
[time=2632] Jesus says to you this morning, if you're hungry, come and eat, come and have me and allow me to fill you up.
[time=2644] But this morning you're gonna need to come.
[time=2646] You know what we've done today and you can just remain with your heads bowed and your eyes closed.
[time=2650] What we've done today is we've given you a chance to both personally and publicly respond, both of which are really important.
[time=2659] There are baskets of bread up here on the stage.
[time=2662] There's a lot of bread backstage, so there's no worries here and we've got some time.
[time=2668] And for those of you two groups, really two groups of you this morning, for those of you in the room today who have never truly genuinely kind of drawn a line in the sand and put a stake in the ground and said that's it, I'm tired.
[time=2683] I'm tired of wandering to the wrong tree, going to the wrong line, eating the wrong bread.
[time=2689] I'm as empty as I've ever been and I'm tired, I wanna be filled up with a saving relationship with the king and savior whose resurrection we celebrate this morning.
[time=2702] You wanna come to Jesus and enter into a life-changing, eternity-altering relationship with him.
[time=2709] We're inviting you to come and we're gonna give you a loaf of bread and we're gonna pray with you and we're gonna encourage you and we're gonna commit to walk alongside you for days and weeks and months, whatever it takes.
[time=2723] I want you to come.
[time=2726] Others of you in the room and this next group, this gets pretty broad.
[time=2732] I hope everybody's listening.
[time=2734] If there's anybody in the room this morning on this day of all days and you need to honestly before God say I know the Lord, I've fully surrendered my heart and life to him, but I'm in that group that Kelly talked about earlier.
[time=2749] I keep wandering to the wrong places.
[time=2753] In my anger and in my disappointment in my unhappiness and in my hurt, I keep trying to find bread and water elsewhere and you know who you are.
[time=2768] And it may be little and it might be big, but even if it's little, it's big.
[time=2773] Does that make sense?
[time=2774] Oh, don't leave this morning without coming forward and renewing your commitment to him by taking a loaf of bread and then taking it symbolically, raising your hand again saying, you know what, I'm in.
[time=2791] I am going to come back to the bread of life that John six says satisfies my hunger and my thirst.
[time=2800] So as Corbin and the team leaders and worship, will you come?
[time=2806] I'm gonna ask elders and past elders and future elders and our staff and any of our ladies that would be willing, I'll just ask you to kind of come and sit in the front or stand in the front, we'll pass out the bread.
[time=2820] I mean it, we got lots of it.
[time=2822] We'd love to give it to you.
[time=2823] We'd love to pray with you.
[time=2824] We'd love to encourage you.
[time=2825] Jesus is the bread of life.
[time=2829] Come and get your bread.
[time=2830] Let's worship him together.
