[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=33] It's great to have all of you with us and I'm so thankful for these few minutes that we get to have each week.
[time=38] Sitting with me today is Josh Ring.
[time=41] Hey buddy.
[time=41] - Hey.
[time=42] - Good to see you.
[time=43] - Great to be here.
[time=44] - Josh is part of our family and as many of you may know, who watch on a regular basis, Josh is also part of our preaching team.
[time=51] I'm so grateful that the elders here at Black Hawk and our staff over these years have really gravitated toward an approach to ministry whereby we think there's great value in more than just one voice.
[time=63] And I'm so grateful for this guy's voice.
[time=66] We've been friends for a bunch of years.
[time=69] Josh and I actually went to the same seminary out in Southern California, the master's seminary.
[time=75] You graduated in...
[time=77] - '98.
[time=78] - 1998.
[time=79] I was back there in one of the first classes.
[time=82] 1990 is when I got done.
[time=86] But we've got some roots that are the same.
[time=89] Josh went to high school and school here at Black Hawk Christian years and years ago.
[time=94] Now he and his wife, Paula, and their girls are part of our family.
[time=99] Josh, tell them about what you do.
[time=101] Tell our folks what you do during the week.
[time=104] Some of our preaching team guys are here on staff.
[time=107] - Sure.
[time=107] - You used to be.
[time=108] - Yes.
[time=109] - But now you're not on staff, you're doing what?
[time=111] - Yep, now I work for a company called Northwestern Mutual.
[time=113] And I just feel like I get the privilege of helping people think through some things that aren't quite as important as what we deal with on Sunday morning, but still important as far as being wise with their finances, helping them think through some of the things that usually are kind of number 11 on the top 10 things to do less as far as their money and insurance and those type of things.
[time=132] So it's a real privilege.
[time=134] And I feel like God has allowed me to interact with different people that I never would have been able to interact with.
[time=140] And it's a real challenge, but it's a real joy as well.
[time=144] - And how long have you been in that field?
[time=147] How long you been working at that?
[time=148] - Yeah, I came up on my five year anniversary in February, which blows my mind.
[time=154] It's gone very fast.
[time=155] - Yeah, we miss Josh on staff, but just so you know, we're really excited about men and women like Josh who make a huge contribution in the marketplace in their area of expertise, a huge contribution, but they also in doing that do so with the light of the gospel in their hearts and in their lives and in the way they live.
[time=176] And so we're really grateful that he's doing that.
[time=179] - Tell the folks, Josh, just real quick, a preaching team, more than just one voice.
[time=185] You've been around preaching for a lot of years.
[time=189] You've been around church ministry for a lot of years.
[time=191] What about what we're trying to do here is encouraging to you.
[time=195] - Yeah, I think it's really healthy as I look at just a scriptural model.
[time=200] I don't personally see kind of one voice.
[time=203] I look at even just the character of God and just the fact that he's such an amazing multi-tasker.
[time=208] He's getting so many things done in so many different ways and using individuals to accomplish different things.
[time=216] And so you and I are very similar in our passions and I think all of us on the preaching team are very similar.
[time=224] And yet at our core, we have some different passions.
[time=226] And so we're gonna come to a text of scripture, maybe just a little bit different than each other.
[time=232] And I think that's a great value for those of you listening as well as those in our congregation.
[time=238] And I think it's just a really healthy thing.
[time=240] I think it's a scriptural model.
[time=241] And so I think there's lots of positives.
[time=243] - I love it too. - And I just get to enjoy it.
[time=245] - Yeah, and I want to enjoy it too, just so you all know, on a Sunday like today, you're gonna hear a message from Josh, from Galatians 1, about the call of God, the good gracious call of God, the radical call of God, on our lives.
[time=261] And I'm gonna get to sit with my family today in a pew with all of our people and just be a part of our church and get taught and get encouraged by Josh.
[time=272] And I just want you to know how much that means to me.
[time=274] And we're thankful that we're doing this at Black Hawk.
[time=277] Thank you for being here today.
[time=279] - My pleasure.
[time=280] - All of you, thanks for tuning in.
[time=281] It's great to have you with us.
[time=282] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=284] God bless.
[time=285] [MUSIC - 101 seconds]
[time=396] (audience clapping) - If you have your Bibles in Galatians chapter one, that's where we'll be this morning, and I've entitled the message, God's incredibly gracious call.
[time=410] I believe the vast majority of the evangelical world,
[time=417] and by evangelical, again, it's just a big word that at its core is the same word for gospel, okay?
[time=424] So the good news of Jesus Christ.
[time=427] So gospel believing churches.
[time=428] I believe the vast majority of the evangelical world believes that Christian salvation and every day thereafter has nothing to do with a human's behavior or efforts or works, but everything to do with God's grace through faith in the finished work of Christ.
[time=449] I also believe that the majority of you sitting here this morning would believe that as well.
[time=456] Some of you this morning may be still outside the faith, you're still maybe exploring that, and that's okay, we love that you're here.
[time=464] Those of you who have truly accepted Christ, I don't think you'd argue with that statement.
[time=469] Our salvation is based solely and completely upon the finished work of Christ, nothing to do with our efforts or our own merits.
[time=478] The question this morning that I have is this, are we living our lives on a daily basis in accordance with our belief?
[time=487] Specifically our belief about the work of Christ on our behalf.
[time=493] And this is what Paul is addressing with the believers in Galatia.
[time=497] In other words, the work of Christ on our behalf should color the way we view everything.
[time=505] It should have impact first and foremost in the way that we relate to God, not just for our salvation, but every day thereafter.
[time=514] And then secondly, as an outflow of that first, it should impact how we relate to one another.
[time=521] How we read the scriptures.
[time=524] The way that we parent, the way that we serve, the way that we interact with those outside of the faith should have impacted every facet of our lives.
[time=535] And so as we look at Galatians, would you read with me verses one through 10 this morning and we'll start our study of what God has to say through the pen of the Apostle Paul.
[time=545] Verse one, Paul, an apostle, not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead and all the brothers who are with me to the churches of Galatia.
[time=559] Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, to whom be the glory forever and ever, amen.
[time=575] I am amazed, astonished, that you are so quickly deserting him, who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel.
[time=586] Not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
[time=592] But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel, contrary to the one we preach to you, let him be a curse.
[time=600] As we said before, so now I say again, if anyone is preaching to you a gospel, contrary to the one you received, let him be a curse.
[time=608] For am I now seeking the approval of man or of God?
[time=612] Or am I trying to please man?
[time=615] If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.
[time=620] Let's pray.
[time=623] Father, again, we just pause and say thank you for the truth and the clarity of your word.
[time=631] Thank you so much for the activity of your Holy Spirit.
[time=634] And so we eagerly anticipate your work, Holy Spirit, in our lives this morning.
[time=641] God, I pray that you would, again, just attend to me, pray that you would help me speak your words, not mine.
[time=649] And I pray that you'd open all of our eyes to see wonderful truths from your word, that we may make much of you.
[time=659] And we pray this in Christ's name, amen.
[time=662] So here's where we're headed this morning as we look at verses one through 10.
[time=666] First, we're gonna take a quick look at just the historical context of Galatians, to understand what was going on back then and there when Galatians was written.
[time=678] Secondly, then we're gonna fast forward to today's current context and see if there are any similarities.
[time=686] And then third, we're gonna find from the scripture three truths to cling to as we embrace and as we face the current culture that we find ourselves in.
[time=698] So first, the historical context.
[time=701] I believe it's vital to understand what's going on here.
[time=704] And first of all, I think it's important to know that Paul preached the gospel in Galatia many years ago and now he is addressing those who have embraced the gospel and believed the message that they were sinners in need of a savior and that only savior was Jesus through the work of, through his work at Calvary as he died on the cross for our sins.
[time=730] In verse two, it says to the churches, which is to the ecclesia, which means the called out ones.
[time=738] Later on in verse six, it says, as he's speaking to those who are called by God.
[time=744] In chapter three, verse two, he refers to them as the ones who have received the spirit.
[time=749] In chapter three and four and five and six, he calls them brethren.
[time=754] People who are brothers in the family of God and sisters in the family of God.
[time=760] And then in chapter three, verse 26, he says, "You are all sons of God through faith in Christ." So it's important for us to understand that Paul is addressing believers.
[time=773] He's addressing those who have already placed their faith in trust in Christ.
[time=777] And what had happened is this, Jewish leaders had come from Jerusalem to the area of Galatia and they had come to literally do battle with Paul's message to the Galatians.
[time=791] These were called Judaizers.
[time=793] These Judaizers or Jews were wanting to combine their system of morality.
[time=801] The law coupled with their traditions that they felt were necessary to adhere to in order to maintain a right relationship with God.
[time=811] So they were there to combine their system of morality with Christ finished work at Calvary, saying that both were necessary in order to be rightly related to God for salvation and every day thereafter.
[time=827] So understand the background here.
[time=830] 30 years prior to Paul writing Galatians to the churches at Galatia, there was no Calvary, there was no cross, there was no crucifixion, there was no covering of sin of Christ.
[time=843] And while God never intended for his people to be relating to him in a works-based fashion, this is exactly how the vast majority of the Jews, the Judaizers were living.
[time=856] Their acceptance before God was based upon their obedience to his law and their compliance with their traditions.
[time=864] And so these Jews, the Judaizers were so entrenched
[time=870] in their tradition and this system of morality that they would not stand for a message which did not include some type of morality, some type of work, some type of effort in order to be made right with God,
[time=890] to receive acceptance before God for salvation and every day thereafter.
[time=895] Now, side note, it's important for us to understand that there was nothing wrong with the law.
[time=902] The law is God given and God gave it to his people and God gives us his commands and the law in order for us to be protected.
[time=912] He gives it to us for our guidance and for wisdom.
[time=916] There's nothing wrong with the law, but understand this, let's be very clear, the law is God's common grace.
[time=923] That just means that it's God's grace to us and it's grace to everyone.
[time=928] It's common to every single individual who has ever walked the earth.
[time=932] In other words, if you would simply obey God's command, life on earth works better.
[time=938] But understand this, while it's God's common grace, the law, it has nothing to do with God's salvific grace.
[time=947] Salvific just means that it pertains to your salvation.
[time=951] So your adherence or their adherence to the law had nothing to do with their salvation or their right standing with God.
[time=962] The problem came when the Judaizers proposed that one's right standing with God for salvation and every day thereafter was determined by his or her obedience to the law on a daily basis.
[time=977] Because a right standing with God has always been based upon faith with a coming Messiah who was going to die for sins.
[time=987] We see that in Galatians chapter three, when it speaks to Abraham and it talks about that Abrahamic covenant way back in Genesis 15.
[time=995] It says that one offspring would come from Abraham and that offspring would be a blessing to the entire nation.
[time=1003] We know from Galatians three that that actually is a reference to the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ who was coming.
[time=1011] And so a right standing with God has always been based upon faith but the Judaizers weren't having it.
[time=1019] They were there to do battle with that message.
[time=1021] And look at what Paul writes regarding their message.
[time=1024] Look at verse seven.
[time=1026] He says, not that there is another one, another gospel but there are some who trouble you and they want to distort the gospel of Christ.
[time=1036] Later on in Galatians and you can just flip there in chapter four, verses nine and 10.
[time=1042] He says this, "But now that you have come to know God "or rather to be known by God, now that you're saved, "how can you turn back to the weak "and worthless elementary principles of the world?
[time=1057] "Who slaves you want to be once more?" The idea of this, now that you've come to know Christ, why would you turn back to the weak and worthless elements of the law?
[time=1068] The law never had the power to save.
[time=1070] Later on in chapter five, he says this about their message.
[time=1075] He says, "Look, I, Paul, say to you "that if you accept circumcision, "if there's an outward work of your performance, "Christ will be of no advantage to you.
[time=1086] "I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision, "that he's obligated to keep the whole law.
[time=1091] "You are severed from Christ, "you who would be justified by the law.
[time=1096] "You have fallen away from grace." Chapter six, he says this about that message.
[time=1104] He says, "It is those who want to make a good showing "in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised, "and only in order that they may not be persecuted "for the cross of Christ, "for even those who are circumcised "do not themselves keep the law, "but they desire to have you circumcised "that they may boast in your flesh." So this message that the Judaizers are bringing, Paul describes it in these different passages as a distortion of the gospel.
[time=1133] He describes it as the weak and worthless elements of the world, he describes it in chapter five in a different way, and then in chapter six, he again adds that you've been severed from Christ if you believe this message, if you hold tight to this message.
[time=1152] So the historical context is here.
[time=1154] The Galatians had two messages being preached to them.
[time=1160] The first was Paul's message, that the Galatians right standing with God for their salvation and every day thereafter was based solely upon the grace of God in Christ and Christ alone.
[time=1175] Their efforts or works could not persuade God to be pleased with them, and their efforts could not maintain God's posture of grace toward them, the first message.
[time=1186] The second message from the Judaizers was this, that the Jews' message, the Galatians right standing with God for salvation and every day thereafter was based upon the work of Christ.
[time=1197] Yes, but also their obedience to the Jews' system of morality.
[time=1204] Their message did not deny the work of Christ, but simply put, Christ's work was not enough.
[time=1212] The Galatians' efforts were essential to their acceptance before God, and their efforts were also essential to maintain this acceptance before God.
[time=1225] So that's what's going on in Galatians.
[time=1229] It's the historical context, the battling of these two messages.
[time=1232] Now I believe as we fast forward to today, that our current context that we find ourselves in is really no different.
[time=1242] It's really no different than what the Galatians were battling with.
[time=1248] The system of morality has really never gone out of style.
[time=1253] It's still functioning.
[time=1256] And it's hard to comprehend and it's hard to understand, but bear with me, our entire world system is based upon performance and transactional living.
[time=1269] It's based upon a system of morality.
[time=1272] Think about it in our judicial system.
[time=1275] Some of it's not bad, some of it's good.
[time=1277] Our judicial system, when you obey the law, there's nothing to fear, right?
[time=1282] But when you break the law, there are consequences to that law.
[time=1286] That there are, in a sense, contractual.
[time=1289] The same thing as we think about our parenting a lot of times.
[time=1292] As long as our children do what we want them to do, everything is fine, but when they're not performing the way that we want them to perform, then usually there's some consequences that come with that.
[time=1306] And again, not necessarily bad, potentially done in a bad way, but not necessarily bad.
[time=1312] In our workplaces, as you continue to perform for the boss, as you stay late maybe, as you work hard, you're more likely to be promoted.
[time=1323] There is this idea that your performance can somehow be rewarded in our workplaces, in our friendships.
[time=1331] And I don't think we'd ever say this, but in our friendships, sometimes we approach it according to the system of morality.
[time=1340] As long as you're a good friend to me, then I'll go ahead and be a good friend to you.
[time=1346] But if for some reason your friendship toward me stops, then guess what?
[time=1351] My friendship toward you is gonna stop.
[time=1353] It's a contract, right?
[time=1356] Instead of just a basic commitment to say, regardless of how you treat me, I'm gonna show friendship to you.
[time=1364] Shows up in Christmas, too, right?
[time=1368] As you think about Christmas, I mean, we're far away from it.
[time=1373] But in Christmas, if you're good, Santa is gonna bring you something good.
[time=1378] But if you're bad, you're only gonna have a piece of coal in your stocking, right?
[time=1383] So the song goes, so you better be good for goodness' sake, right?
[time=1391] In every other world religion.
[time=1394] Listen, every other world religion, there is some sort of works-based mentality that says as long as you do such and such thing, then you're going to gain a reward of heaven.
[time=1406] And if you're even more obedient, then you might even get a better level of heaven.
[time=1412] Or if we think of just karma in general, if you're doing good, then it's gonna come back on you fourfold.
[time=1422] Our entire world system.
[time=1424] And again, understand, this system is not necessarily all bad, all these things that I've just spoken about.
[time=1430] It does carry some truth to it.
[time=1433] There's some biblical principles that undergird it.
[time=1436] I mean, the idea that Galatians says, "Don't be deceived, you will reap what you sow." God has also then given us rulers to keep the peace.
[time=1445] And so to some extent, some of these things are really good.
[time=1449] And it's really gracious of God to allow those things to be, but understand this.
[time=1454] It's only God's common grace.
[time=1458] Again, common grace, that which is good for everyone, whether you know the Lord or not, the problem comes or occurs when we bring this system of morality or this performance into the way that we now relate to God.
[time=1479] When we begin to believe that our right relationship with God is gained or maintained by our own acts of obedience.
[time=1487] You see, God's directives in Scripture, his commands, therefore are good.
[time=1494] Milton Vincent would say that they're friendly signposts from a heavenly Father who loves us and wants what's best for us.
[time=1501] They are God's common grace, even unbelievers benefit from them.
[time=1505] But again, let's be clear.
[time=1508] It has nothing to do with God's salvific grace to us.
[time=1512] Our temptation, my temptation is to fall prey
[time=1518] to the same trap then that the Galatians did, to use the law, to use the commands in scriptures to feel better about ourselves when we obey.
[time=1532] Anybody relate to that?
[time=1537] We use the law to feel better about ourselves when we obey.
[time=1544] We use it to our credit.
[time=1546] How much easier it is it to say, okay, if that's the standard, I'm gonna do my best to reach it because that makes me feel much better about myself.
[time=1555] And man, I wanna feel good about myself.
[time=1559] But at the basis, at the basis, it's falling prey to the same temptation that the Galatians had to deal with.
[time=1569] And again, there's really no way to avoid it.
[time=1572] We're surrounded by this system of morality.
[time=1578] It's in the air that we breathe.
[time=1580] It's natural, it's that which flows out of our flesh.
[time=1584] It's unnatural to be the opposite, right?
[time=1586] It's unnatural for us to offer friendship regardless of how that person treats us.
[time=1591] It's natural though for us to say, "Hey, if you're not gonna treat me well, then forget it." This whole thing's off, right?
[time=1599] So it's unnatural, it's out of our flesh.
[time=1603] And here's what it comes down to.
[time=1605] It's like the corporate rat race.
[time=1607] Everybody know what I'm talking about?
[time=1608] The idea that if you just work longer hours, if you travel more, if you build more, if you do more, eventually you're gonna get to the spot where you wanna be.
[time=1619] But what happens when you get to that spot, there's always more that you can keep doing.
[time=1624] And it just never gets to an end.
[time=1626] Same thing can happen with Christianity.
[time=1631] I call it the Christian rat race.
[time=1633] You never feel like you're doing enough.
[time=1638] You need to do more.
[time=1639] You need to be better.
[time=1640] You need to be a better parent.
[time=1644] Be a better husband or a better wife.
[time=1647] Again, I'm not saying that's bad, but understand why you're motivated to do those things.
[time=1654] There is this idea of, I somehow have to read more
[time=1661] and pray more, right?
[time=1662] What's the answer of somebody struggling?
[time=1665] Some sort of situation in a counseling, the easy answer is read more, pray more.
[time=1670] And we all fall in line to it as we try to spin the plates in the spiritual rat race to say, "Oh, I've been reading my Bible well.
[time=1680] "Oh, but I haven't been sharing Christ with unbelievers lately.
[time=1683] "I gotta get that split plate spinning.
[time=1686] "Oh, I'm not evangelizing well, but you know what?
[time=1689] "Oh, I'm forgetting to share things in parent really well.
[time=1692] "So I gotta get that plate spinning.
[time=1694] "And they go from one plate to the other plate "and just trying to keep it all up.
[time=1698] "And it all comes back to who?
[time=1699] "You.
[time=1700] "You're responsible.
[time=1702] "And you really want it to be that way "because when you're doing well, "you feel really good about yourself." It's the Christian rat race.
[time=1712] You know, whenever I'm in a parenting situation and you know, I think I have two lovely girls, I love them to death, I really have a temptation to want them to perform a certain way.
[time=1725] Not necessarily for them, but because it's easier for me.
[time=1730] And in that situation when I get angry and I respond in a harsh voice, my temptation at that point is to think this, oh, man, I totally blew that.
[time=1746] But next time, next time I'm not gonna blow it, I'm gonna be better next time.
[time=1752] I'm gonna do this better next time.
[time=1756] Do you see, see what's happened at that point?
[time=1760] I'm allowing the rat race to sneak into my life and to force me to say it's all about me, it's all about me being better.
[time=1770] Most of us don't think that we struggle,
[time=1776] but it's out there.
[time=1778] Satan is so sneaky.
[time=1781] This idea of performance-based relating to God, just sneaks in and listen to this, I think it's a daily battle and it can be detected when we find ourselves more consumed with our daily activities than the cross of Christ.
[time=1798] Think about my parenting example.
[time=1801] I was more concerned about how I performed in that and how I was going to perform better the next time than the cross of Christ.
[time=1809] It's a daily battle and I think it can be detected when we find ourselves more familiar with our past sins than the work of Christ.
[time=1819] When we find ourselves living with some sort of low-grade guilt, I believe it's a daily battle and can be detected when we find ourselves obligated, feeling obligated to serve or feeling obligated to pray or feeling obligated to read our Bible.
[time=1836] It's a daily battle and I think it can be detected when we find ourselves just lacking joy, when we find ourselves unable to forgive ourselves or to forgive others as well.
[time=1854] So I don't think we're much different than the Galatians.
[time=1858] I think the historical context of those two different messages that the Judaizers were bringing and Paul bringing, now fast forward is the same message, same area, same context that we deal with today.
[time=1870] It's a daily battle and so God and his graciousness
[time=1876] has offered us three truths to cling to from Galatians that I think you'll really enjoy hearing about.
[time=1883] The first truth is this, as we wanna unpack Paul's counsel to the Galatians because we need to receive that same counsel, the first truth is this, that God calls people, you and me, into a different way of relating to him that isn't based upon our performance.
[time=1903] Look at what it says in verse six.
[time=1906] Paul says, "I'm astonished that you are so quickly "deserting him who called you in or into the grace of Christ." Notice this is God's personal and specific
[time=1921] and intentional call upon your life, if you're a believer, to enter into a relationship with him that isn't based upon your performance.
[time=1932] It's based upon the grace of Christ, the work of Christ on your behalf.
[time=1939] It's not your performance anymore, it's his performance that has now been credited to you.
[time=1947] And you see, I think one of the things, it's hard to believe the full scope of the gospel.
[time=1953] It's that radical, it's that amazing, it's that unbelievable because no other system, no other relationship works that way.
[time=1966] It's completely different, and so it's hard for us to sometimes believe the full scope of it, but what this is saying is this, you didn't stumble into this.
[time=1975] You don't have to question it as if it were your idea, and now you're not quite sure that it's actually true.
[time=1983] God, your father, does not want you to relate to him in a transactional performance-based way.
[time=1990] He's called you into the grace of Christ, amen.
[time=1997] Go back to my parenting scenario.
[time=1998] I've been angry at Hollis.
[time=2000] My first temptation is to say, "Oh man, I need to do better.
[time=2005] "I need to be a better parent.
[time=2007] "I gotta stop getting angry when she disobeys, "and that's fine, and that's good." But how about this?
[time=2013] When I understand that I've been angry toward it, I recognize my sin, I make it right with my child, and I run to Christ, because he's the only one.
[time=2026] He's the only one who can cover my sin in that area.
[time=2029] And now I say, God, I love you, I'm so grateful, I've sinned against you, I was harsh in speaking to my child, would you please forgive me, and now as you've forgiven me, would you empower me every single day to do my best from this point on, in your grace and in your strength, knowing that I don't have to be better, because Christ was.
[time=2053] God calls us to relate to him in a different way.
[time=2060] Christ said himself in Matthew 11, "Come to me, all you are weary and burdened, "and I will give you rest." See the truth of the gospel is that when God calls us
[time=2072] to relate to him, we get to rest in him.
[time=2075] There's freedom in that.
[time=2079] There's joy in that.
[time=2081] He wants you to relate to him, get this, without worry, without fear, knowing that he delights in you, regardless of your performance, because he delights in Jesus.
[time=2099] Your right relationship with God is gained and maintained
[time=2105] completely apart from your efforts.
[time=2108] You want an example of this?
[time=2109] You can go to Paul.
[time=2111] In Philippians chapter three, it'll be up on the screen here.
[time=2114] But if anybody could boast in his performance, it was the Apostle Paul.
[time=2119] Listen to what he says.
[time=2121] In Philippians chapter three, four through nine, it says, "Though I myself have reason for confidence "in the flesh, if anyone else thinks he has reason "for confidence in the flesh, I have more.
[time=2131] "Circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel, "of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, "as to the law of Pharisee, as to zeal a persecutor "of the church, as to righteousness under the law, "blameless, but whatever gain I had, "I counted his loss for the sake of Christ." Indeed, he says, "I count everything as loss, "because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ, "Jesus my Lord, for his sake I have suffered "the loss of all things.
[time=2157] "Count them as rubbish in order that I may gain Christ "and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own."
[time=2167] But the righteousness of Christ.
[time=2169] If anybody could relate to God in a performance-based way, according to his morality, it would be Paul.
[time=2176] He says, "I'm not going there.
[time=2178] "I want to be found in him." So first, God calls us into a completely different way of relating to him.
[time=2191] He calls us into the grace of Christ.
[time=2194] Secondly, the gospel is the only way that this is possible.
[time=2198] Look at verse four.
[time=2201] He says this, "Grace to you and peace from God our Father "in the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins "to deliver us from the present evil age, "according to the will of our God and Father, "to whom be the glory forever and ever." Verse six, "I'm astonished you are so quickly "deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ." Notice that grace is a possessive, and the one that possesses the grace is Christ.
[time=2228] The gospel is the only thing that makes this happen, 'cause he is the only one who has covered our sin as verse four says.
[time=2239] You know, we deserve the wrath of God.
[time=2242] Our sin, our rebellion against God, our desire to do life our own way versus God's way causes us to be in the very center of God's wrath.
[time=2256] We deserve that.
[time=2258] And yet Christ took all of God's wrath that you and I deserved, and all of that wrath was spent on him at Calvary when he died on the cross.
[time=2269] For our sins, he gave himself.
[time=2273] He took the punishment that you and I deserved, and that's the only way that we can now relate to God in the way that he's calling us to relate to him.
[time=2285] God is pleased with me because he's pleased with Jesus.
[time=2289] If it were not for the gospel, you could not relate to God in any other way than according to the system of morality, according to the law.
[time=2301] And you would be striving to please a God who could never be pleased with anything but perfection.
[time=2309] And thus, my moral life and your moral life would lead us to a miserable life here on earth and also an eternity of justified wrath.
[time=2317] The gospel makes it possible for us to relate to God in this new way that he's calling us.
[time=2324] And third, there is no other gospel.
[time=2328] Look what it says in five through nine.
[time=2331] He says this, six through nine most astonished.
[time=2334] You're so quickly deserting him who called you, turning to a different gospel.
[time=2339] Not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and they want to distort the gospel.
[time=2344] But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel, contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be a cursed.
[time=2352] As I said before, so now I say again, if anyone is preaching to you a gospel, contrary to the one you received, let him be a cursed.
[time=2360] Listen, there is no other good news.
[time=2364] There is no other way to turn.
[time=2366] There is only Christ.
[time=2370] He is the only one who has died for you.
[time=2373] No one else has.
[time=2375] No one loves you more or better than Jesus.
[time=2380] This is the best news that you will ever receive.
[time=2385] And this news, never, the goodness of this news, never lessons.
[time=2391] Every single day, we experience the goodness of this news.
[time=2396] Every single day, there is no better news than that you get to be found in him.
[time=2403] It's the best news ever.
[time=2405] It's been announced to you.
[time=2407] God's salvific grace has been preached to you.
[time=2412] Three truths to cling to in the midst of our current context,
[time=2419] where we're tempted is to fall in line with the performance, with transactional type of living.
[time=2428] God calls us into a different way of relating to him.
[time=2432] He makes it possible through the sacrifice of Christ.
[time=2437] And there is no other gospel.
[time=2440] There is no other good news.
[time=2442] As we end this morning, the application is simply this.
[time=2449] Could I ask you this morning to hold fast?
[time=2455] Maybe this morning you've known the Lord for a long, long time.
[time=2458] Maybe this morning you've walked in this morning or you're listening online and you've not surrendered your life to Christ.
[time=2465] No matter where you find yourself, this is the best news to hold on to.
[time=2472] And so would you hold fast?
[time=2475] You know, Paul said to Timothy in first Timothy, "Timothy, don't lose your grasp on the gospel," he says.
[time=2483] I say the same thing this morning.
[time=2486] Hold fast to the truths and the beauty of who Christ is and what he's done.
[time=2493] Hold fast to God's incredibly gracious call on your life.
[time=2498] You do not have to perform to be made right with God.
[time=2504] That's amazing.
[time=2506] There's no other system or relationship that works like that.
[time=2512] Christ's performance has prevailed.
[time=2514] I just ask you to hold fast to that.
[time=2518] Don't distort it.
[time=2521] Don't desert him as it says in verse six.
[time=2525] "I am astonished you're so quickly deserting him "who called you.
[time=2530] "The minute you run to something else, "you're turning your back on Christ.
[time=2534] "And you're saying, I'm gonna do this one on my own.
[time=2538] "Don't desert him.
[time=2540] "Don't distort the gospel.
[time=2542] "Hold fast to the gospel.
[time=2544] "And then get this.
[time=2546] "When you fully realize the scope of this reality,
[time=2552] "you are then moved by the spirit "to a place of gratefulness.
[time=2558] "And then something really big happens.
[time=2561] "His incredibly gracious call produces the fruit of obedience.
[time=2566] "Your life may not look differently
[time=2572] "if you're living in a performance-based "versus living in the call of Christ, "but the starting point is completely different.
[time=2581] "Completely different.
[time=2584] "So his incredibly gracious call produces "the fruit of obedience.
[time=2588] "In other words, the fruit of your freedom "is not licentiousness." We worry about that sometimes, right?
[time=2595] In fact, Paul even talked about in the book of Romans.
[time=2598] If we're covered by grace, why don't we just go ahead and sin?
[time=2602] That's not what happens, people.
[time=2605] When you really understand the grace and the mercy of Jesus Christ, the fruit of that is obedience.
[time=2619] There's an offer that I really like, his name is Tullian Tovidian.
[time=2622] He's actually the grandson of Billy Graham and he preaches at Coral Ridge down in Florida.
[time=2629] He speaks about this.
[time=2630] I think we have sometimes a propensity to think, gosh, if I put too much grace out there, people are gonna take advantage of that, right?
[time=2641] That may be true, but listen to what he says about this.
[time=2644] He's speaking specifically about parenting, but I think it relates to our bigger, broader topic here this morning.
[time=2651] He says this, "I understand the fear of grace.
[time=2655] "Grace just being God's incredibly gracious call on us.
[time=2661] "As a parent of three children, "one of my responsibilities is to disciple them "into a deeper understanding of obedience, "teaching them to say no to the things that God hates, "and yes to the things God loves, but all too often.
[time=2674] "I have wrongly concluded that the only way "to keep licentious hearts in line is to give more rules." The fact is, however, that the only time licentious people start to obey is when they get a taste of God's radical, unconditional acceptance of sinners.
[time=2691] The irony of gospel-based living is that those who end up obeying more are those who increasingly realize that they're standing with God is not based upon their obedience, but Christ's.
[time=2704] That's huge.
[time=2705] And again, the irony is it may not look differently on the outside.
[time=2710] We want to be obedient, but let's let the gracious call of God in our lives
[time=2717] lead us to a gratitude that says, "I don't have to obey, Christ obeyed for me, "but now I get to obey, "and I get to relate to people now in the same fashion "that God has related to me." Listen, the law will never be a sustainable motivator for obedience, was never designed that way.
[time=2736] There's no power in it, but on the flip side, I believe the Holy Spirit uses the gospel, the person work of Christ to motivate our obedience.
[time=2747] Milton Vincent and his little gospel primer said this, "It's never easy to obey," he said.
[time=2755] I agree with that, but he goes on to say this, "It's never more easy to obey "than when you're drinking deeply of the truths "of the person and work of Christ." I believe that's true.
[time=2770] And I believe the scriptures, back that up.
[time=2774] If we had time to go through the whole book of Galatians chapter five and six, it speaks to the obedience that flows out of the grace that God has given us.
[time=2783] But all over the place, Ephesians five would tell us, husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church, where's the motivation?
[time=2793] The motivation to love your wife is found in the way that Christ has loved you, not because you have to, not because you're obligated to, but because God has done so much for you.
[time=2807] Ephesians four, 32, he says, be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ Jesus has forgiven you.
[time=2817] What's the motivation to offer forgiveness to someone?
[time=2821] It's never easy, it's never more easy than when you're understanding the great forgiveness that you've received from a holy God.
[time=2830] And now when you understand that, now I can more easily offer forgiveness to somebody else.
[time=2837] How do you relate to one another?
[time=2839] John 1334, he says, "A new commandment I give you "that you love one another, just as I have loved you."
[time=2848] Our motivation to love one another in this room isn't based upon how they perform for you.
[time=2854] It's not based upon their merits or their efforts, but it's because Jesus has loved you.
[time=2861] These are just examples of the fruit of obedience which flow out of your radical acceptance by God through the work of Christ.
[time=2871] They're all over scripture.
[time=2872] I encourage you to look for them, but it all starts with him.
[time=2878] It all starts with him and his incredibly gracious call and his work, and it's also sustained by him every single day thereafter.
[time=2889] It's his incredible call in our lives, sustains us in a right relationship with him, and then to come back to how Galatians 4 ends.
[time=2898] This God, this Father, deserves all the glory,
[time=2905] forever and ever and ever.
[time=2908] God, we love you.
[time=2910] I'm overwhelmed, again, it's your gospel.
[time=2914] There is nothing else like it.
[time=2919] Every other system and relationship that we run into
[time=2926] is contrary to it, it seems.
[time=2930] And yet you call us into this wonderful relationship.
[time=2934] Or would you help us to rejoice in that?
[time=2936] For those that might be listening are here today that don't know you yet.
[time=2940] Oh God, would your call be specific to them today?
[time=2943] Would you open their eyes to see how much they need you?
[time=2947] And for them to see that rest and true rest can only be found in you.
[time=2954] And then no one loves them more or better than you do, Jesus.
[time=2957] Thank you, Father.
[time=2962] May you receive all the glory, in Christ's name we pray.
