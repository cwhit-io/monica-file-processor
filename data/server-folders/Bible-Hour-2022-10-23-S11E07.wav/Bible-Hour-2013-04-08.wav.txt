[time=31] - Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] It's great to have you with us and I'm so thankful for this day and the chance to share with you not only a continued update in terms of a new ministry partner that Blackhawk has been able to build relationship with but we get to introduce you live and in person to the CEO of that ministry Ralph Bordeaux.
[time=53] Good to see you my friend.
[time=55] - Good to see you too Kelly.
[time=55] - Yeah, we're grateful that Ralph is here.
[time=57] Many of you might recognize Ralph from the Skype conversation we had a few months ago, Ralph is the CEO of as our own.
[time=66] And as I say those three words, my heart fills up.
[time=69] I know many of yours does as well.
[time=71] We've had the privilege in December of this past year to give our gifts that go to Ralph and his team and the remarkable young ladies that they're loving and caring for at as our own over in India.
[time=86] Ralph, just briefly, for those who maybe are kind of joining this conversation late, tell the folks what as our own does.
[time=94] Kind of just the basic undergirding mission of your ministry.
[time=98] - Absolutely, thank you Kelly.
[time=99] And thank you for your support over this Christmas.
[time=102] As our own works to rescue the most vulnerable children from what would be the most horrifying, enslaving circumstances.
[time=111] And we rescue them from the circumstances and then care for them, not as vulnerable children, not as orphan children, but as our own children for life.
[time=119] - That's fantastic.
[time=120] That's probably what really drew us to Ralph and to as our own the most was the fact that these young gals taken out of these horrific situations are truly cared for, loved, educated, spiritually invested in as if it were their own daughters.
[time=138] And really it's not even as if it were, they really are.
[time=141] They adopt them into their family.
[time=143] They love them with the love of a father and a mother.
[time=146] A family really truly is born there.
[time=148] And so how many girls, Ralph, I mean, currently, approximately, how many young ladies are you guys having the privilege of investing in?
[time=156] - Right now we have 75 daughters that God has blessed us with.
[time=160] - Wow, wow, 75.
[time=162] Tell the folks who are watching.
[time=164] I know many of them want to know.
[time=166] The gift that was given at the end of this year, I think it was close to $240,000.
[time=171] We were blown away.
[time=172] It was so exciting for us to be a part of that.
[time=175] Those funds as they now come to you guys, what will those funds be used for?
[time=179] What are you excited about when you think about investing those funds into this next year of ministry?
[time=185] - Absolutely.
[time=186] First and foremost, I just want to thank everyone for this amazing, amazing sacrificial and blessed, blessing filled gift that you made to invest in the lives of these children in India.
[time=198] What's very exciting to me is every year we have a planned budget that goes to invest into the lives of these children in their care, in their schooling, in their housing, in their medical attention, and the security that we have to provide because of the devastating circumstances of trafficking and all of that that we rescue them from.
[time=218] And so this gift, first and foremost, is the single largest gift that we received as a ministry.
[time=226] It is absolutely amazing what God did through this campaign.
[time=230] And this gift will go to provide for about 55 children for their complete care, their education, and as well as their security and health.
[time=241] - Fantastic, that's great.
[time=242] Well, it was Ralph talks about it being a blessing to them.
[time=247] He knows as well that it was a blessing for us as a team, as a ministry, to see God work that way in our family and in many of your lives as well.
[time=256] So thank you for your ongoing partnership with us.
[time=259] Thank you for tuning in each and every week.
[time=261] Thanks for the way many of you gave to Ralph and these remarkable young ladies and this remarkable staff and team that Ralph gets to be a part of each and every day.
[time=271] Thank you so much for tuning in.
[time=272] Hope you'll come and see us soon.
[time=273] God bless you and have a great, great week.

[time=598] (upbeat music) (audience applauding)
[time=617] - Hey, the last time, the last time
[time=623] that we as a family had the chance to see and hear from Ralph Bordeaux was on a video that he and the young ladies that has our own made for us, they made that video as a thank you to us and I too am grateful again.
[time=639] Every time I think about what you, what we as a family got to be a part of this past December.
[time=644] We challenged you to maybe rethink Christmas.
[time=648] We challenged you to rethink how you spent your money in December, we challenged you, young people and old people and everybody in between.
[time=656] We said, would you be willing to give a sacrificial gift this December, a gift that's gonna go?
[time=663] And it's gonna go to India, it's gonna go to Azar own, it's gonna go to helping bring freedom and a hope and a future to these precious little gals that God is allowing Azar own to rescue out of some of the darkest, most horrific scenes you could ever imagine.
[time=681] And you responded with generosity and kindness and $240,000 got sent a while ago and Azar own just continues to do God's work
[time=696] in God's place, in God's time, in that setting and we couldn't be more grateful for them and for the way they are going about that Ralph Bordeaux, the CEO of Azar own spends a lot of his time in India, spends a bunch of time back here in the States based in Chicago and we invited Ralph to come this morning, he wanted to say thank you to all of you, face to face, wanted to share with us a little bit more of what God's doing in Azar own, so would you please, Ralph, come in, would you welcome Ralph with a warm black talk, welcome.
[time=729] (audience applauding) - Awesome. - Yep, absolutely.
[time=734] (audience applauding) Hey, I just want you to know before I turn it over to Ralph, it's just been good to get to see him.
[time=744] We had dinner last night together, Ralph and Will, who's out at the table, want you to go by the table today on your way out and I want you to say hi to Will and get some information, learn more about Azar own.
[time=755] We had dinner as a staff, we got to be with them last night.
[time=760] Ralph and I'll have lunch today and I want you to pray for us.
[time=764] We're gonna talk today about possibly me and some others from our team and from our family going over to India this summer to kind of be on the ground there, to get to know not only Ralph and the Azar own team better, but to actually walk the streets, be in the brothels, understand the ministry a little bit better, understand more of what God's doing in and through their investment in those precious little gals and we don't know what the future holds for Black Hawk and Azar own, but we certainly are willing to explore that and would you pray for us today as we have lunch and talk a little bit about that.
[time=799] I know Ralph's grateful to get to be here and I know there's a lot on his heart so Ralph takes some time and share with the folks what God has on your heart.
[time=807] - Thank you Kelly and thank you so much Black Hawk family.
[time=812] It was such a privilege to speak with you over Skype from India during the Christmas season and you know Christmas has come and gone but what you did in obedience to the Lord will last forever and Christmas brought to us the one name and the one person who can save and can redeem us and can redeem the darkest darkness that there is in the world in whatever form that Satan might be working to orchestrate it and one of the worst forms of this darkness that Satan works to orchestrate that I have seen personally is where he works to destroy innocent young lives and especially the lives of innocent young children.
[time=858] There is a myth in India that the innocence of a young girl can heal AIDS.
[time=862] And India in 2006 became one of the largest AIDS, became the country that had one of the largest number of AIDS cases in the whole world and it still competes with South Africa for having that number of patients with HIV.
[time=880] And so men think that the innocence of this young little child can heal this dreaded disease that they acquired through the sinful lifestyle and the result of that is little girls, six, seven year old girls are sold into the world of trafficking where their lives are destroyed.
[time=897] And if God's people are not present in his name, standing on behalf of these children in Jesus name, Satan will destroy their lives.
[time=908] Every day about 80 children are trafficked and sold into this incredible world of destruction.
[time=913] But this Christmas, what you did was bring
[time=920] his incredible redemption into the lives of innocent young girls that God cares for as his daughters and you brought them into your family and into our family to care for as our own for life.
[time=934] And we are always asked this question, how long are the girls in your program and are they up for adoption?
[time=941] And our answer is it's not a program, it's a family.
[time=946] And the girls are part of our family for life.
[time=950] And secondly, because they have been adopted and adoption is the most beautiful form of care that God provides, God himself did not leave us as orphans but adopted us into his family through Jesus.
[time=963] And in the same way, these children, these girls have been adopted by the as our own family.
[time=969] So I don't know if you knew this, but this Christmas your family grew by what's 75 daughters.
[time=974] (audience applauds) And I can't wait to share with you,
[time=983] just over this year, what an amazing impact.
[time=986] Your investment as you worked, Kelly was sharing with me last night just how amazingly this thought has been developed of just redeeming Christmas.
[time=997] And the result of that is not just the way that God has redeemed Christmas in the lives here, but the amazing way that he has actually brought that redemption physically into the lives of our daughters and your daughters in India.
[time=1011] Each of these girls just comes from an incredible background that could have resulted in complete destruction.
[time=1019] And I'll just share this one thing.
[time=1022] I don't usually do this and are we on the internet live?
[time=1026] - Yes. - Okay.
[time=1028] So I'll just say this, I'm not gonna point out, but one of the girls in this picture, her mom had been trafficked at one time and was working to traffic her and this was while I was still in the corporate world.
[time=1044] And by God's grace, I was able to just see what Satan was orchestrating, the destruction he was trying to orchestrate for her life.
[time=1052] And we were able to protect her and move her into our own home.
[time=1055] And the result of that was I left the corporate world and started the ministry of Azeron.
[time=1060] But I just wanted to tell you that this February and February 23rd, she graduated from seminary with her Bachelor of Theology degree.
[time=1070] (audience applauds) And so this is a walk, this is a journey.
[time=1079] It's not just rescuing her from the darkness of being trafficked, but really rescuing her into the grace and truth and the love in the light of Jesus Christ.
[time=1088] 'Cause we know is when the sun sets her free, then she is free indeed.
[time=1092] And that is what we call the day of days.
[time=1094] We wait for that in each of the lives of our girls where their identity is replaced from being an orphan or a vulnerable child to being a daughter of the king.
[time=1104] And we wait for that day of days where the sun sets her free and she is free indeed.
[time=1110] And he becomes more and we become less.
[time=1113] And that I know is the goal of this ministry and the ministry of our lives together is that he would become more in their lives and our lives and we would become less.
[time=1123] And thank you that you in this amazing way, the single largest gift that our ministry received this year was from the Black House family.
[time=1132] Thank you so much for what you orchestrated in the lives of our daughters and your daughters.
[time=1137] I know the Lord will bless you immensely for that, but I can't wait to also share with you throughout this year how immensely he has blessed our daughters in India as well.
[time=1147] Thank you all so much and God bless you all abundantly.
[time=1149] (audience applauds) Yeah, you can stand up.
[time=1156] [AMEN - 1 seconds]
[time=1165] (audience applauds) One of the things that Ralph shared last night and he mentioned it even first hour that just again sets, I think, a picture, you know, and sometimes we just need pictures painted as it continues to motivate, encourage and inspire us to keep going forward.
[time=1185] Most of these girls, Ralph's told us as young little girls and even the young little boys that are there.
[time=1192] Most of the girls at the earliest of age have spent years as their mothers are trafficked and do what trafficked mothers do with clients.
[time=1201] Most of them live in small little confined spaces and while all that's transpiring, most of these kids are kept under the bed.
[time=1209] So these little girls have grown up under a bed where their mom has been trafficked.
[time=1216] And this is their memory, this is their reality, this is what they grew up with.
[time=1223] And so when you think about the darkness that has a hold, when you think about the ministry of Azar own and they're not just, he's so right, they're not just taking them out of a building, they're taking them out of demonic darkness and into the light and it is a tremendous challenge and there are so many things that come with that and they are grateful for our investment but I know they need our prayer and they need you to faithfully remember them in your prayers.
[time=1249] So would you just symbolically with those precious little girls in mind and the team that helps, would you just reach your hands toward Ralph this morning and would you just let us as a family pray for him and for them as we go forward.
[time=1261] Our father in heaven, we're grateful this morning for this dear brother, for our dear brothers and sisters who are over there giving encouragement and investment and time and energy into the lives of, as Ralph has shared with us this morning, our daughters.
[time=1277] Little girls that we've helped to come to freedom and we pray God that as they invest in them, as they care for them physically and academically and spiritually, oh God we pray you'd give them great wisdom and strength, boldness and courage as they secure them from those who would want to come and take them back, we pray that you would give them great strength and God I pray that in our family as we continue to think about the opportunity to encourage and support them, oh God I pray that we would be aware of the very darkness here in our own community, that we would be aware of places where Satan has entered in and that we would with the same courage and boldness be a people who would reach into that which is dark to pull it toward that which is light.
[time=1320] Oh God give us courage to be that kind of people continue to give Ralph safety and wisdom as he leads.
[time=1326] We're thankful for all you've done in your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1330] Would you open your Bibles this morning to First John, it's back toward the back of your New Testament, First John we begin today quite a journey my friends, this is gonna be a 12, 12, 13 week study, we're gonna go verse by verse section by section chapter by chapter through the entire book of First John and I can't wait for what I believe God is going to teach you and show you and allow us to experience together as we do it, I'll be teaching, Steve will be teaching, Jesse, Josh, our team's gonna give everything we've got to this.
[time=1366] We are so excited about what we believe God's gonna do and as we start out this morning I wanna just remind you of something, this is gonna be for many in the room maybe very basic, this for many of you in the room maybe something that you live with every day of your life for others of you in the room though I think it's important that you understand this, this that I'm about to tell you.
[time=1386] And I'm gonna tell you this by asking you a question and I wanna answer the question and I wanna make sure we all hear the answer.
[time=1394] Why is it so important that we study the Bible?
[time=1399] Why is it so important that we would take so much time
[time=1406] and make such an effort to communicate principles from the pages of God's Word?
[time=1410] What is it about this ancient book that we believe is so very true, what is it about the scriptures that make it such a priority for us and just in case you haven't noticed it's a priority for us.
[time=1424] We have a thing called the Bible Hour.
[time=1426] We have worship services every Sunday at 91045 where we lift it up and we do our very best to see it and understand it and teach it and explain it.
[time=1435] We have a thing called Lagos Institute of Biblical Studies where every Wednesday night here and other nights around our community, Rod and Carolyn Ovid and their team are instilling the truths of doctrine and the life of Christ and the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[time=1451] There's enormous efforts being made with middle school kids and high school kids and now even young adults and ABFs on Sunday mornings where the Word of God gets taught and proclaimed, I'm asking you, why do we make such a big deal?
[time=1468] And now we're gonna do 12 weeks.
[time=1472] Let me just remind you this morning.
[time=1476] This could be a 13 point talk.
[time=1479] I'm gonna just give you just three quick things to think about.
[time=1482] I hope you'll write these down.
[time=1483] I hope you'll think about this.
[time=1485] My friends, understand this.
[time=1487] Understand that the Word of God, according to Jesus and Matthew 4, and oh, how I have seen this, oh, how I have experienced this many of you have as well, please understand the Word of God is food.
[time=1499] Please understand it is food.
[time=1503] You need it desperately to even live.
[time=1508] And the tempter came to Christ and said to him, Matthew 4, 3, if you are the son of God, command these stones become what?
[time=1514] Say it, bread.
[time=1516] But he answered and said, it is written, man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.
[time=1526] My friends, the Word of God is food.
[time=1528] My friends, the Word of God is your sustenance.
[time=1531] My friends, it is what you need to take in.
[time=1533] You need to take it in morning, noon, and night.
[time=1537] What food provides for your body, the Word of God provides for your soul.
[time=1541] And I would argue and your body.
[time=1544] You and I need it.
[time=1545] We need it desperately.
[time=1547] We need it on a regular basis.
[time=1549] The Word of God is food.
[time=1550] You know what else the Word of God is?
[time=1552] Go back to, go to the Psalms if you would.
[time=1554] Look at Psalm 119, I wanna say this to you loud and clear.
[time=1557] Many of you like me heard this verse when you were a kid, you've memorized it, you've sung it, you've heard it talked about.
[time=1563] It is as true today in my life as it was the first day.
[time=1566] I read it Psalm 119, 105.
[time=1568] It says, "The Word of God." It says, "Your Word, O God, is a lamp unto my," what?
[time=1575] "To my feet and a light to my path." I hope you'll write this down.
[time=1580] My friends, the Word of God gives direction.
[time=1583] It is food and it is direction.
[time=1585] And I don't know everybody in this room, but I know a lot of you.
[time=1589] And as I look around this room and I think about the circumstances of your life today, when I think about what you're facing and what you're encountering and the stuff you're having to navigate and wrestle with, I know many of you in this room, you need some direction.
[time=1605] Don't you?
[time=1606] You need some help and I also know this.
[time=1610] I also know that the enemy is trying desperately day in and day out all through your day to bring competing voices into your mind in terms of what direction you're gonna listen to.
[time=1620] There's all kinds of directional options and yet the Word of God it says is a lamp unto your feet.
[time=1628] It is a light for your path.
[time=1631] And whatever path you're on right now, believe me, believe me, the Word of God gives you your best shot at traveling that path with wisdom and clarity and obedience.
[time=1645] It is food, it is direction.
[time=1648] And then anytime I wanna be reminded of the great value of the Word of God, I go to Psalm 19.
[time=1656] You could even turn there if you wanted to.
[time=1658] I wanna just read you a few verses.
[time=1659] It says in Psalm 19, some things about the scriptures that I have always found so encouraging and so helpful.
[time=1667] It says, speaking to the Word of God, it calls it different things in this little brief passage, but all of these are references to the scriptures.
[time=1679] The law of the Lord is perfect.
[time=1682] David says in Psalm 19, seven.
[time=1685] The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul.
[time=1689] The testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple.
[time=1693] So there you go, there's two things right there.
[time=1695] The Word of God has the power to restore your soul.
[time=1699] And I know you and you know me, our souls need restoring constantly.
[time=1704] The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul.
[time=1706] The testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple.
[time=1710] I know you need wisdom.
[time=1712] The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.
[time=1716] We're gonna talk a little bit about joy a little bit later, but I know many of you in the room have been robbed of yours.
[time=1725] And it says, the Word of God can bring it back.
[time=1730] It can bring joy to the heart.
[time=1732] The commandment of the Lord is pure and lightening the eyes.
[time=1736] The words of God, verse 10, they're more desirable than gold.
[time=1739] Yes, than much fine, gold, sweet, or also than honey.
[time=1743] And the drippings of the honeycomo.
[time=1745] Don't miss verse 11, where it says, "Moreover by them the words of God your servant is warned." Some of you in the room this morning, others of you watching online, individuals who will catch this on the broadcast a week later, you need to be warned today.
[time=1768] And today, for whatever reason, the Word of God might warn you.
[time=1774] It might wave a flag that you need to see.
[time=1777] I don't know what you're contemplating.
[time=1780] I don't know what road you've started down.
[time=1783] I'm not sure what's transpiring in some of your relationships, but to be sure in a room this size, there are some who very well may need the warning power of the Word of God.
[time=1794] Why do we study the Word?
[time=1796] Why do we make such a big deal about it?
[time=1799] Because it's food, because it's direction, because it is all that Psalm 19 says it is.
[time=1804] Amen?
[time=1805] I hope it's encouraging for you.
[time=1807] All right, two hugely important things to address at the outset of our study at first John.
[time=1816] I wanna talk to you briefly about John himself.
[time=1819] I wanna talk to you about the apostle John.
[time=1821] I wanna talk to you about the author.
[time=1823] I wanna talk to you about kind of where he comes from, where he fits in to this whole unfolding drama of the New Testament.
[time=1829] And secondly, I wanna talk to you like Josh did last week with Galatians 1, I want you to understand and see the historical, real setting that John writes this book in.
[time=1841] What was going on in that community of faith?
[time=1844] What was happening in the church at that time?
[time=1847] It will give you, I promise you, it will give you great insight into what he writes and it'll help you understand the application for you and for me as well.
[time=1856] So as it relates to John, I know you heard it in there, Peter, James and John, this was the very beginning of his ministry.
[time=1862] Now Jesus in essence says it's time.
[time=1864] It's time for this thing to unfold.
[time=1866] It's time for me to do what God has sent me here to do.
[time=1870] And in his divine sovereign strategic plan, you know and I know he goes and finds these JV guys.
[time=1879] They weren't the sharpest pencils in the deal.
[time=1882] They were fishermen who didn't make it into the synagogues as the future junior rabbis.
[time=1889] They were just plying the family trade, doing their very best and with normal everyday dudes, he goes up and says, "Hey, let's go change the world." And Peter, James and John are the first ones he called.
[time=1903] So please understand this, John, the author of the book we're about to study was there from the very beginning.
[time=1909] He was one of the very first of the Lord's disciples.
[time=1912] He listened to Jesus, he traveled with Jesus, he watched miracle after miracle, took in teaching after teaching, observed Jesus and his interactions with those who loved Jesus and watched Jesus with those who detested him.
[time=1928] He John was there for it all.
[time=1932] Start to finish, stem to stern, didn't miss a thing.
[time=1935] In fact, the scriptures say that John was the one Jesus loved.
[time=1940] Gives you even more insight into the level of relationship and the intimacy that they shared.
[time=1946] John, it says in John 13 was the one that Jesus loved.
[time=1951] And as he sits down to write this last epistle, a first, second, and third John, he really is and appropriately so, he really is a living legend in the Christian world at that time.
[time=1964] Listen, one author said it this way, although he was greatly advanced in age when he penned this epistle of first John, he was probably 95 years old.
[time=1975] John was still actively ministering to churches.
[time=1978] He was the sole remaining apostolic survivor who had intimate eyewitness association with Jesus throughout his earthly ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension.
[time=1991] And I just want you to picture that just for a moment.
[time=1994] I think it's absolutely cool.
[time=1996] He's the last man standing.
[time=2000] Of all of those who were with him, of all of those who were a part of his inner circle, of those initial 12 that he had called, here's the last one of them all.
[time=2013] John, the apostle, John, the church fathers, Justin Marder, Irenaeus, Eusebius, they all in their writings indicate that after the time of Christ's ascension, John lived at Ephesus in Asia Minor, carrying out an extensive evangelistic program, evangelistic, reaching others for Christ.
[time=2033] Imagine what a powerful mystery that would have been coming from a guy like this who had seen all that he had seen.
[time=2040] He was overseeing many of the churches that had arisen during this time and conducting an extensive writing ministry.
[time=2047] He wrote the gospel of John.
[time=2048] He wrote first, second, and third John.
[time=2050] He wrote the revelation.
[time=2053] One church father, Papayas, who had direct contact with John described him as a living and abiding voice for the church as the last remaining apostle.
[time=2065] John's testimony was highly authoritative among the churches.
[time=2069] Many eagerly sought to hear the one who had first-hand experience with the Lord Jesus.
[time=2076] Why do I stop to make this point as we begin our journey through first John?
[time=2083] Why would I bring emphasis to this, do you think?
[time=2086] I think it's important that we recognize that what we're about to study wasn't slapped together out of hearsay, myth, or tradition.
[time=2097] I think it's important that every one of us understand that what we're about to dive into for 12, 13 weeks is a first-hand account.
[time=2106] He was there.
[time=2110] He saw it, he heard it.
[time=2113] As you'll see in the passage, he touched it.
[time=2116] This wasn't something he heard on a street corner.
[time=2120] This wasn't something passed down through a great ant.
[time=2123] No, this is first-hand experience.
[time=2126] He hung out with Jesus.
[time=2130] He took it all in.
[time=2132] And now he shares it with us.
[time=2133] And I think there's great credibility in that.
[time=2136] A couple of years ago, I was in New York City.
[time=2138] I was there for, I think, a Michigan State game and was with some friends and ended up taking a taxi from, I think, from the Garden, from Madison Square back to the hotel.
[time=2149] I wanted to stop and get something to eat along the way.
[time=2151] The guy was more than happy to let his meter run while we drove a couple of places.
[time=2154] And me being me as I'm driving in this New York City taxi, I couldn't help but start talking.
[time=2160] To this taxi cab driver who was a fascinating guy from Pakistan.
[time=2164] And so I remember talking with him that day and the conversation turned to 9/11.
[time=2169] And come to find out that this guy in his taxi was actually downtown.
[time=2176] Manhattan, you know, downtown, midtown, uptown.
[time=2179] He was downtown.
[time=2180] He was three blocks away from the towers as the plane's hit.
[time=2187] And he began to describe for me what he experienced and what he saw and what took place on 9/11.
[time=2194] You could describe that for me.
[time=2198] You saw the reports.
[time=2200] We've seen the documentaries.
[time=2201] We could do a decent job of letting people know what transpired on 9/11.
[time=2207] He began to talk about sitting in his taxi, shocked and stunned.
[time=2212] Communication was off.
[time=2214] The whole city was shutting down.
[time=2216] He talked about sitting there in that taxi and actually watching, watching bodies hit.
[time=2223] He began to talk about how as an hour, 45 minutes and an hour went by, the second buildings now have been hit.
[time=2231] He told me about watching families who didn't live far from the towers, who knew and were aware of loved ones in the tower.
[time=2238] He began to paint a picture for me of families literally running up to these buildings and being dragged away by security who wouldn't let them go in.
[time=2248] He began to describe for me the conversations that you could hear from people, stories up as they yelled and screamed for help.
[time=2257] He describes this to me in terminology and with pictures
[time=2263] that were almost too real to even take in.
[time=2266] And I want you to understand that I now have an appreciation for and an understanding of what transpired that day at those buildings because I heard it from a guy who was where.
[time=2279] He was there.
[time=2281] And I want you to know, my friends, that John was there and that he heard it and he saw it and he touched it and he witnessed it and he tells you and he tells me about it, all of it right here in this book that we begin to study this morning.
[time=2303] The second hugely important idea we want to look at this morning as we jump into first John is why?
[time=2308] Why did John write it?
[time=2309] What's the historical reality?
[time=2311] What's the context there in that day?
[time=2313] What was going on then and there in the early church that so concerned the heart of God and leads God to work through or inspire, he inspires the writing, he inspires John to address it.
[time=2325] What was the historical problem?
[time=2327] Well, the problem was the issue was a rapidly growing mindset, this teaching called, write it down, Gnosticism, G-N-O-S-T, Gnosticism, Gnosis, Knowledge, and the bottom line, listen, I'm gonna cut off a lot of the edges here but I'm gonna take you right to the heart of the matter.
[time=2344] The bottom line on Gnosticism was this, two things.
[time=2347] It taught people, first of all, it taught people and promoted the notion that the physical, the body, right, skin, flesh, matter, the physical, the body was evil, they said.
[time=2360] And that the spirit, the mind was the only thing good.
[time=2364] Body, physical, bad, mind, spirit, good.
[time=2369] So the Gnostics and their commitment to this teaching and this idea denied the humanity, denied the humanity of Jesus.
[time=2379] To preserve him and their minds from evil, they denied and began to teach others to deny the humanity, the physicalness of Jesus.
[time=2389] Believe me, you don't want a non-physical Jesus.
[time=2394] It is one of the foundations of our faith,
[time=2400] the fact that he was what you are and what I am, right?
[time=2404] He was 100% man and he was 100% divine
[time=2410] but all how we and our faith needs that foundation to not be toyed with and they were toying with it big time.
[time=2419] Secondly, listen, it taught people and promoted, Gnosticism did the priority of knowledge.
[time=2426] Gnosticism valued knowing.
[time=2430] Gnosticism valued head smarts and thinking.
[time=2434] It was an elite club that distanced themselves from the common ordinary dummy like you and me.
[time=2444] They distanced themselves from the common ordinary folk, for theirs was a higher thinking, theirs was a higher knowledge.
[time=2451] So man watch, so man's mind, so man's reason, so man's thinking were set high and above all else, which leads to what?
[time=2466] I'm asking, think about that for just a moment.
[time=2471] What does that lead to?
[time=2475] It led to it, then, and I am telling you, it leads to it today.
[time=2481] Does any of this sound familiar?
[time=2483] You can figure this out.
[time=2486] When you, when what you know, when what you know, when what you think,
[time=2498] when man's reason is established as the bar, then watch this, oh I hope you'll get this, then man's ideas stand then as judge, over God's divine revelation.
[time=2510] When man's reason and man's knowledge is lifted up, man's ideas stand as judge over God's divine revelation.
[time=2519] God's divine revelation comes down, man's mind and reason goes up.
[time=2524] Instead of God's revelation standing as authoritative over man's ideas.
[time=2531] Now, question for you, is it any different today?
[time=2534] Yes or no?
[time=2538] No, it's no different today.
[time=2541] Honest to God, had a conversation just about two weeks ago, very well-intending person, says this to me.
[time=2546] Said, Kelly, snap out of it.
[time=2550] Really bright, really smart people are poking holes in your ancient book, Left and Right.
[time=2561] Said that to me.
[time=2562] We had a great conversation.
[time=2565] You got to remember in those situations you got to stay gracious, you got to stay patient, you got to be honest, got to ask questions.
[time=2574] I'm thankful to be in that conversation, to be quite honest with you, with that person.
[time=2578] The church faces the same issue today.
[time=2582] But the Apostle John encountered we see today running rampant in our world.
[time=2589] Really smart people have come to their own perspective on self-indulgence, same-sex marriage, gluttony, materialism, spending, legalism, gossip, the list goes on and on.
[time=2604] All things that God, in his word to us, in his divine revelation, and nobody has debunked this, nobody has disproved this.
[time=2615] I don't care what you hear, what they say, come talk to us, we'll help you continue to find relevant, meaningful, current insights and scholarly, wise treatments of this whole issue.
[time=2627] It's as true as the day is long.
[time=2631] It says authentic and authoritative as we've always believed it to be.
[time=2636] All things, self-indulgence, same-sex marriage, materialism, spending, legalism, gossip, you name it, that God has addressed and given us loving, clear direction on and what's happened.
[time=2648] Well, smarter, brighter people have come along and said, basically, we don't wanna live that way, right?
[time=2657] It's not really some deep, mental, scholarly deal, they just basically have just said, we're smarter and brighter people and we don't wanna live that way.
[time=2671] We think, we reason, this way.
[time=2675] Then we think our reason and our ways better
[time=2681] on all those things I just listed.
[time=2682] And you know what the truth is?
[time=2684] As I live life with them and I'm so thankful I get to live life with many of them and as I look at their lives, I sometimes wanna ask them, how's that working out for you?
[time=2693] How's that going?
[time=2695] Now don't laugh too much at that 'cause I oftentimes wanna ask you that same question.
[time=2702] And oftentimes you should ask me because sometimes those far from God and sometimes those close to God aren't appropriating God's truths and God's principles nearly as much as we should, amen?
[time=2719] So this is why God had John right, first John.
[time=2725] I think we should take a look at it.
[time=2728] How about you?
[time=2730] So here's how we're gonna come at this.
[time=2731] The culture of the day at that time was heavily influenced by Gnosticism.
[time=2735] Gnosticism was trying to redefine saving faith.
[time=2739] Stay with me.
[time=2740] Gnosticism is trying to redefine saving faith.
[time=2745] Society was attempting to say that's not truth.
[time=2748] No, we have a higher knowledge.
[time=2750] We have a higher insights.
[time=2751] We're smarter, brighter.
[time=2753] That's not truth, this is truth.
[time=2755] Don't be so narrow.
[time=2757] Listen, don't be so rigid.
[time=2759] You ever hear that?
[time=2761] I hear it all the time.
[time=2763] I hear smarter, brighter people telling me I'm really narrow and rigid because they're so smart.
[time=2768] They figured this thing out and it's a lot more open and it's a lot more lax and it's a lot more easy.
[time=2774] Narrow, rigid.
[time=2778] I've been called repressive and conservative.
[time=2783] I've always found it interesting how somehow over time the clear, unambiguous, loving, loving design of God for salvation, for sexual expression, for marriage, for parenting, it's always been interesting to me how it's gotten classified over time as rigid, repressive, conservative, narrow.
[time=2803] The truth of the matter is when someone gives me direction, when someone gives me loving direction to their home for a dinner party and they tell me to get off at this exit and go down four lights and turn left and go down three streets and turn right and on the four street go down the cul-de-sac and then the last house on the right, I don't walk up to the door and say, "Dude, why are you so rigid?" In your directions, you're so repressive.
[time=2832] I'm offended, you know?
[time=2834] I'm also hungry, so let's eat.
[time=2836] And I'm glad I'm there, you know, we don't do that and yet that's exactly what God has done and I want you to be, I want you to be thankful this morning.
[time=2843] Are you, that He gave you directions?
[time=2846] That you're not out wandering the streets trying to figure out how to get to what's His name?
[time=2851] No, He gave us direction and it's not rigid and narrow, it's loving and right.
[time=2857] We can handle it in a way.
[time=2860] Oh, please hear me.
[time=2861] We can handle it in a way that's very rigid and very repressive.
[time=2866] That's us though, right?
[time=2868] Don't be that way.
[time=2870] But the direction is pure, it's butter.
[time=2874] Absolutely love it, I'm so thankful for it.
[time=2876] I hope you are too, amen?
[time=2878] So here's what He does.
[time=2879] Here's what we're gonna do in the next 12 weeks.
[time=2882] His whole treatment, back to first John, took us a while, sorry.
[time=2886] The whole treatment of first John is Him revisiting doctrine and morals.
[time=2892] He revisits doctrine and then morals.
[time=2894] Next page, doctrine, then morals.
[time=2899] What do I mean by doctrine and morals?
[time=2901] What He does, He's not redefining salvation.
[time=2904] He is defining again the foundations of real salvation and He does it by addressing truth doctrine and how you live out that truth, morals.
[time=2917] All through these weeks, that's what you're gonna hear.
[time=2919] We're gonna talk about doctrine and morals, truth and how we live it out, section by section, chapter, after chapter.
[time=2926] Now, would you look at first John one, one to four?
[time=2930] And I wanna, I'm just gonna read this to you.
[time=2932] This was my intent this morning to have you hear these words.
[time=2936] It almost will bring a smile to your face, knowing what you know now about Gnosticism, knowing what you know now about how physical and flesh and body is bad and spirit and knowledge is great.
[time=2950] Listen to how the Apostle John with a sense of humor at age 95
[time=2956] gets this ball rolling.
[time=2957] What was from the beginning?
[time=2960] Why don't you stand in honor of God's word?
[time=2962] Let me read this to you.
[time=2963] What was from the beginning?
[time=2966] And Adam, you guys can come on back up.
[time=2969] What we have heard, here you go, be listening.
[time=2972] What we have heard, what do you hear with?
[time=2976] Ears.
[time=2978] What we have seen with our what?
[time=2981] Eyes.
[time=2982] What we have looked at and what?
[time=2984] Say it.
[time=2985] Touch.
[time=2986] This is great.
[time=2987] With our hands concerning the word of life, Christ.
[time=2991] And the life was manifested.
[time=2995] Do you know what manifested means?
[time=2996] It means made into flesh.
[time=2999] Something that wasn't got turned into something that was real and fleshly manifested to us.
[time=3008] What we have seen, verse three, what we have seen and heard.
[time=3011] We proclaim to you also so that you two may have fellowship with us and indeed our fellowship is with the father and with his son, Jesus Christ.
[time=3021] Oh, I love that.
[time=3022] These first three verses basically are a clear right out of the gate shot at Gnosticism.
[time=3028] How many times did you hear physical body verbiage?
[time=3032] Saw, touched, heard, felt.
[time=3035] But what I want you to really see as we leave is the last verse.
[time=3040] Would you look at verse four?
[time=3042] It says there, these things, oh, this is powerful.
[time=3044] These things we write so that our, your joy and our joy, so that our collective joy may be made complete.
[time=3055] Church, hear this.
[time=3057] I think you need these next 12 weeks.
[time=3059] I really do.
[time=3060] And I'm gonna shoot straight with you here.
[time=3062] I love you.
[time=3063] I've known many of you for years when you've known people for a long time.
[time=3066] You can say this stuff.
[time=3067] I really think that a lot of us in this place today
[time=3073] are lacking joy.
[time=3075] Sometimes I see more defeat on your heart and on your soul and on your face than I do victory.
[time=3083] And you know me, I'm not a raw, raw type guy, but I'm trying to be biblical and I'm trying to shoot straight.
[time=3089] And the fact of the matter is your salvation is a great salvation.
[time=3093] And there is real hope in what you have embraced.
[time=3097] There is.
[time=3098] And whatever you're encountering, whatever it is you're facing, whatever road you're navigating, God's word tells us, John gives us all of this foundational re-addressing of our faith so that you can be joyful.
[time=3110] And I think too much of our joy has been robbed.
[time=3114] I think too much of our happiness has been taken away.
[time=3118] And I hope and pray over these weeks that you'll join me in a study of first John.
[time=3123] He writes these things so that we might have joy.
[time=3129] Young people, old people, red, yellow, black and white, poor and rich and everybody in between.
[time=3138] The word of God calls us to a relationship and walk with him that is filled with joy.
[time=3143] May we be joyful in the days to come.
[time=3145] Let's worship our God together.
