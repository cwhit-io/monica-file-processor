[time=219] Come and rise up from the grave. Our sins risen from the dead. We are one with Him again. Come away, come away. Come and rise up from the grave.
[time=233] Whoa, death, where is your sleep? Whoa, hell, where is your victory? Oh, Church, come stand in the light.
[time=250] The glory of God has defeated the night, singing all down. Where is your sleep? Oh, hell, where is your victory? Oh, Church, come stand in the light. Our God is not dead.
[time=275] He's a lie, he's a lie. Christ is risen from the dead, simply over death, my head.
[time=283] Come away, come away. Come and rise up from the grave. Christ is risen from the dead. We are one with Him again. Come away, come away.
[time=297] Come and rise up from the grave. Christ is risen from the dead, simply over death, my head. Come away, come away. Come and rise up from the grave. Christ is risen from the dead. We are one with Him again. Come away, come away. Come and rise up from the grave.
[time=327] And I will rise, I will rise, as Christ was raised to life, now in Him, now in Him.
[time=354] I will rise, I will rise, as Christ was raised to life, now in Him, now in Him, now in Him. I will rise, I will rise, I will rise, as Christ was raised to life, now in Him.
[time=379] I will rise, I will rise, as Christ was raised to life, now in Him, now in Him. I will rise.
[time=407] I will rise, I will rise, I will rise, I will rise, I will rise, I will rise, I will rise, as Christ was raised to life, now in Him, now in Him, now in Him, now in Him.
[time=434] So I will rise, I will rise, I will rise, as Christ was raised to life, now in Him, now in Him, now in Him.
[time=455] I will rise, I will rise, I will rise, I will rise, I will rise, I will rise, I will rise, I will rise, I will rise, I will rise, as Christ was raised to life, now in Him.

[time=515] - Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=518] It is as always good to spend these few minutes with each and every one of you in the broadcast audience.
[time=523] We're thankful for each and every one of you.
[time=526] And I hope all of you are enjoying this new study in the book of 1 John.
[time=530] It is gonna be a lengthy study, but one that I hope you will come back to week after week, after week.
[time=536] This is a test.
[time=538] It really is.
[time=539] A whole book of 1 John, given as a self-examination so that you and I can truly test the faith that we claim we have.
[time=548] There is a way that we will live.
[time=553] There are beliefs that we will hold onto and there is a living out of those beliefs that we will model if we are truly, genuinely saved.
[time=564] And I hope that you'll be with us as we look into this great truth in the weeks to come.
[time=570] I also want to secondly, this morning, tell you about something that maybe you've heard about, maybe you've even experienced, but I want you to know it's there.
[time=577] We're now live streaming our broadcasts at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=583] That's right, you can go to our website.
[time=585] And most importantly, not just you, but those that you know, people who live in Texas, people who are across the world in Europe.
[time=593] We've got folks in Africa that are watching.

[time=599] They can now go to blackhawkministries.org at nine and 1045 Eastern time and watch our services.
[time=606] We are so thankful for technology, thankful for the way it allows us to connect with people.
[time=612] And so if it fits your schedule, if it fits someone who you know, schedule, we'd love for you to pass the word along.
[time=619] We are now live on Sunday mornings live streaming.
[time=622] And I'm so thankful for the hundreds and hundreds of people that are now tuning in.
[time=627] A great opportunity for us to connect with them.
[time=629] And almost in a sense, create an online, if you will, community, an online congregation that we get to call our own care for love and equip.

[time=764] [MUSIC - 295 seconds]
[time=1071] Hey, I was five years old, I know it.
[time=1079] There's things I don't remember about six or seven, but I'll tell you this, I remember I was five years old the first time I ever got a Los Angeles Laker t-shirt.
[time=1087] I wore Los Angeles Laker t-shirts.
[time=1095] I watched the Lakers.
[time=1097] I went to Laker games.
[time=1099] I lived and breathed.
[time=1101] I yelled when they won.
[time=1103] I cried when they lost.
[time=1105] I can tell you who the seventh man was in 1973.
[time=1109] I know more about the Lakers than I should.
[time=1113] I'll tell you what, and as a Laker fan, and I'm telling you, I'm a Laker fan, as a Laker fan, as a true Laker fan, there's really only one thing.
[time=1124] There's really only one entity.
[time=1126] There is only really one group of people that we did test, can't stand, and abhor.
[time=1132] My only regret is that Curtis Smith isn't here this morning to hear me say this in person.
[time=1136] It would be the Boston Celtics.
[time=1139] I don't like the Boston Celtics.
[time=1142] Anybody who's a Laker fan knows that you don't like the Celtics.
[time=1145] I met a ministry gathering a couple of weeks ago, and I met a table with a guy.
[time=1149] We're just doing small talk before the meal and the speaker.
[time=1152] He says to me, "Your reputation has preceded you." I said, "Yes, I am." He says, "I am too." So I look at him, and I think, "Huh, another kindred spirit." But then the next sentence out of his mouth revealed him to not be a true Laker fan, because he said, "I hope we meet the Celtics in the finals." And I had to just pull him aside and correct him, because if in fact he was a Laker fan, he needed to understand that that's not what we hope.
[time=1179] We hope Boston loses every game of the year.
[time=1182] We hope they never reach the finals.
[time=1184] Because we want them to go, "Oh, in '82, we could care less about their playoff life." He looked at me like, "Dude, you're whacked." I said, "I am.
[time=1193] I am completely whacked, and I'm a fan." And I said to him, "You've got to check yourself there, young man.
[time=1199] You've got to really check yourself.
[time=1201] You've got to see if, in fact, you're truly a fan.
[time=1204] We come to a book, first John, my friends, all kidding aside.
[time=1209] We come to a book of the Bible that gives you and I the opportunity to check ourselves.
[time=1216] To see if, in fact, what we say.
[time=1222] Really, truly, genuinely finds expression in the way that we believe and live.
[time=1229] And I'm so grateful for our opportunity in this book.
[time=1232] This idea of testing ourselves is not simply relegated to first John.
[time=1238] Paul wanted his readers in Corinth to do the same thing.
[time=1241] In Corinthians 13.5, you see it on the screen.
[time=1243] I want this to be your, I hope, endeavor here today.
[time=1247] I hope this will be your desire in the days and weeks to come.
[time=1250] I hope as we give ourselves to this study that this is something you genuinely, truly will be willing to engage in.
[time=1257] Paul said to the church at Corinth, he said, "Examine yourselves." Examine yourselves.
[time=1264] To see if your faith is what?
[time=1267] Say it, church.
[time=1268] Genuine.
[time=1269] Test yourselves.
[time=1271] Surely you know that Jesus Christ is among you.
[time=1275] If not, you have failed the test of genuine faith.
[time=1280] The Apostle John in response to false teaching we saw last week that had the power to confuse and destroy both the church and the faith sets out to provide us with both doctrinal and moral tests.
[time=1294] This is the great endeavor of first John.
[time=1296] In response to Gnosticism, John comes along and says, "Okay, here's how we're going to do this.
[time=1301] I'm going to give you doctrinal material that allows you to test what you believe.
[time=1307] I'm going to give you tests of truth.
[time=1311] And I'm also, as you read this letter, I'm also going to provide you with moral tests.
[time=1317] Meaning this is what you believe.
[time=1320] Now do you live out that truth morally.
[time=1324] Doctrineal tests and moral tests.
[time=1326] This is what John does.
[time=1327] First John is a restating of truth and a direct call.
[time=1333] And oh, it's very direct, you will see.
[time=1337] A direct call to live out the truth with integrity and authenticity.
[time=1342] John says in the face of Gnosticism, time out.
[time=1345] Hold on.
[time=1346] He says, "Let's be really clear here.
[time=1348] This is the faith.
[time=1350] And if you're in, this is how you will live.
[time=1355] This is the faith.
[time=1357] This is how you will live.
[time=1359] Test yourself.
[time=1361] Check yourself." So watch this.
[time=1365] I didn't delve into this much last week.
[time=1368] I want to come back though and set the stage for you in terms of the outline of the book.
[time=1372] Chapter one, you ready?
[time=1375] Chapter one, verse one.
[time=1377] To chapter two, verse two is the first test.
[time=1381] We've actually started the testing.
[time=1383] I want to just catch you up.
[time=1385] It is the first test.
[time=1387] One, one, two, two is the first ready doctrinal test.
[time=1393] John says you cannot be a genuine follower of Christ.
[time=1398] If you don't hold on to, if you don't believe the truth is stated in one, one to two, two.
[time=1407] And this first doctrinal test comes in two parts.
[time=1411] And we handled the first part last week.
[time=1414] And we're going to handle the second part this week.
[time=1417] And last week, the first part of the test was the truth about Jesus.
[time=1420] My friends, you can't be in.
[time=1423] You cannot be a genuine follower of Christ.
[time=1426] If you don't down deepen your soul, believe the truth about Jesus.
[time=1432] And the truth about Jesus we saw in verses one through four.
[time=1436] Looked there with me if you would.
[time=1438] What was from the beginning?
[time=1440] What we have heard?
[time=1441] What we have seen with our eyes?
[time=1443] What we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the word of life, Jesus.
[time=1449] And the life, Jesus, was manifested.
[time=1453] And we have seen and testified and proclaimed to you the eternal life,
[time=1459] which was with the Father and was manifested to us.
[time=1464] And what we have seen and heard, we proclaim to you also, so that you too may have fellowship with us.
[time=1470] And indeed, our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.
[time=1477] These things we write so that our and your joy may be made complete.
[time=1485] Real quick, the truth about Jesus, important that you have this from your notes last week.
[time=1490] This was a closely verses one to four, and our message last week was a clearly stated biblical view of Christ.
[time=1497] We saw that number one Christ was pre-existing.
[time=1500] You can write that down.
[time=1502] He was a pre-existent Christ.
[time=1504] The text says that He was with the Father.
[time=1507] And what we know about the Father, what we know about God, is that there's no beginning to God.
[time=1512] God has always been.
[time=1513] And the text is clear that Christ was with the Father.
[time=1517] We know it's true as we look at the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and the triune Godhead Christ was with God.
[time=1526] From the beginning, which there was none, in eternity past our Lord Jesus Christ with the Father,
[time=1535] He was pre-existent.
[time=1537] He came to earth, it says.
[time=1540] John records for us the fact that He came to earth, that He came to earth in the flesh, that what was not flesh became flesh.
[time=1550] This is called being made manifest.
[time=1554] You can jot that down.
[time=1555] He was made manifest.
[time=1557] Christ came to earth in physical bodily form.
[time=1562] And again, this would have been hard for the Gnostics because the Gnostics were trying to propagate a new gospel that said physical and flesh was bad.
[time=1572] And John says, no, no, no.
[time=1573] We are restating the truth here.
[time=1575] And the truth is Christ, who was from eternity past, came to earth in physical bodily form.
[time=1583] And it is a great encouragement for all of you this morning.
[time=1587] It was a great encouragement for the church then.
[time=1590] Please understand how desperately you and I needed a physical Savior.
[time=1598] We didn't so much need a mental Savior.
[time=1602] No, your body and mine, your flesh and mine, oh how desperately, amen, we needed someone to come and physically beat this thing.
[time=1617] And when, and he did, he came in bodily form.
[time=1620] He was made manifest.
[time=1622] And thirdly, we saw in this biblical view of Christ that John and others saw and felt and heard him.
[time=1630] I had attorney friends last week as we treated that first section tell me what a great opening argument that would have been in any effort, in any courtroom to try and establish the credibility of a witness, which is what John was, a witness, the fact that he saw him, the fact that he felt him, the fact that he heard them, the fact that he was with Christ.
[time=1654] The reality of Jesus Christ.
[time=1659] The truth about Jesus.
[time=1661] This is the first part of our first doctrinal test.
[time=1665] And today we come to the second part of this first doctrinal test.
[time=1670] And this morning we look at the truth about sin.
[time=1675] It's important that you believe the truth about sin.
[time=1682] And to get us going I want you to read with me through the passage 1 John 1 5 through chapter 2 verse 2.
[time=1690] Would you in honor of God's word stand and let me read this for you.
[time=1695] This is the message we have heard from him and announced to you that God is light.
[time=1701] And in him there is no darkness at all.
[time=1703] If we say that we have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness we lie and do not practice the truth.
[time=1711] But if we walk in the light, as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with each other.
[time=1717] And the blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin if we walk in the light.
[time=1725] If we say verse 8 that we have no sin we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us.
[time=1730] But if we confess our sins he is faithful and righteous to
[time=1736] forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[time=1740] If we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us my little children.
[time=1749] And that is said dearly.
[time=1751] That is in no way an antagonistic.
[time=1754] That is in no way a degrading diminishing term.
[time=1758] That is like a father talking to his kids who he loves deeply.
[time=1762] My little kids.
[time=1764] I am writing, remember he's 95.
[time=1768] I'm writing these things to you so that you may not sin.
[time=1773] And if anyone sins we have an advocate.
[time=1777] With the Father Jesus Christ the righteous.
[time=1780] And he himself is the propitiation.
[time=1784] He himself is the substitute.
[time=1788] He himself is the propitiation.
[time=1791] It is a word that means he stood in your place and mine and took and experienced and endured what you should have.
[time=1801] He is the propitiation.
[time=1803] He is the one who dealt with.
[time=1806] He is the one who experienced.
[time=1808] He is the one who took on himself fully the sin of all mankind past, present and future.
[time=1816] Jesus Christ the advocate the righteous one.
[time=1819] The propitiation for our sins.
[time=1824] And not for ours only.
[time=1827] But also for the whole world as well.
[time=1830] You can be seated.
[time=1832] Let me show you three things this morning from the scripture here in 1 John regarding the truth about sin.
[time=1838] I want you to see and learn or be reminded this morning that it's impossible for sin to exist in proximity to God.
[time=1845] We'll see that in verses 5 through 6.
[time=1847] It is impossible absolutely utterly impossible because of the nature of God and the nature of sin for sin to exist in proximity to God.
[time=1858] Secondly, I want to show you in verses 7 and then in verses 1 and 2 of chapter 2 that the only remedy for sin, John 14, 6 Jesus said I am the way, the truth and the life.
[time=1870] No man comes to the Father but by me.
[time=1875] I want you to see this morning that the only remedy for sin and thus the only route to proximity to God, relationship with God is Christ.
[time=1887] The person of Christ, the sacrifice of Christ, the saving work of Jesus for you.
[time=1894] It is the only route to proximity with God.
[time=1899] Thirdly, I want to show you that the way to experience the forgiving work of Christ as it relates to our sin is to practice something the Bible calls confession.
[time=1910] We'll see that in verse 9.
[time=1912] Let's go back to the first point.
[time=1914] It's impossible for sin to exist with.
[time=1917] It's impossible for sin to exist in near, around, close to.
[time=1922] There can be no sin in proximity to a holy God.
[time=1927] Would you turn in your Bibles?
[time=1929] Let's do some page turning this morning.
[time=1931] Can we do that?
[time=1932] Grab your Bible, please.
[time=1933] If you've got one and I want to hear you opening to Revelation 21.
[time=1937] Please do that.
[time=1938] Open up to Revelation 21.
[time=1941] I want to just talk to you a little bit here.
[time=1943] Have you see from the Word of God this idea of the great holiness of God and by nature of His holiness and by nature of His character, His absolute inability to in any way.
[time=1954] Be close to, be joined to, be in relationship with sin.
[time=1959] Revelation 21.
[time=1960] Oh, what an amazing section this is.
[time=1964] It's talking here in Revelation 21.
[time=1966] My friend's about the new Jerusalem.
[time=1968] You know that there is going to be some day when it's all said and done.
[time=1972] You know, right, that there's going to be a new earth.
[time=1975] You understand that, right?
[time=1977] At the end of the day, we're all going to end up back here, those who are His.
[time=1981] And the Scriptures teach that there is going to be a new and perfect earth.
[time=1987] And on earth, there will come down this thing called a new Jerusalem, heaven in its finest.
[time=1993] And the new Jerusalem will come down and this is where the temple will reside.
[time=1997] And I love what John in his vision here in Revelation says, "I saw no temple in it."
[time=2003] Talking about the new Jerusalem.
[time=2005] For the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
[time=2010] And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it.
[time=2015] For the glory of God has illumined it and its lamp is Jesus, the Lamb.
[time=2022] The nations will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.
[time=2030] In the daytime, for there will be no night there.
[time=2032] You knew that right, no night.
[time=2034] There will be no darkness.
[time=2037] Its gates will never be closed and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.
[time=2042] And nothing unclean and no one who practices the abomination and lying shall ever come into it.
[time=2051] But only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.
[time=2058] What a picture.
[time=2060] What a picture of perfection.
[time=2062] What a picture of glory.
[time=2064] What a picture of purity and the light of God and there will be no darkness.
[time=2069] There can't be because he's God.
[time=2072] First Peter, go, let me hear those pages turned.
[time=2075] Go back to 1 Peter chapter 1, will you?
[time=2078] 1 Peter chapter 1 says in verse 14.
[time=2082] Paul here, excuse me, Peter writing to the church.
[time=2086] The church is at large.
[time=2088] And he says to all of them as obedient children, verse 14, as obedient children do not be conformed
[time=2096] to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance.
[time=2100] But like the holy one, perfect one, set apart one, high and lifted up one.
[time=2105] But like the holy one who called you, be holy yourselves also in all of your behavior.
[time=2113] If you're because it is written, you shall be what?
[time=2116] Say it, church, holy, for I am your God.
[time=2120] I am holy.
[time=2125] There can be no sin in or around near or in proximity to God.
[time=2129] That's why Paul said to the church at Ephesus, look at Ephesians 5, if you would.
[time=2134] Look at Ephesians 5 verses 3 to 5.
[time=2138] Learn in your Bibles if you would there, Ephesians 5, 3 through 5, but immorality or any impurity
[time=2147] or greed must not even be named among you.
[time=2151] In one translation it says there shouldn't even be a hint of it.
[time=2157] As is proper among who?
[time=2159] Among saints, those who are his.
[time=2162] That's you, if you're raising your hand and you're saying that's you, then this is a
[time=2169] great opportunity for you to check yourself.
[time=2173] Not even a hint as is proper among saints and there must be verse 4, no filthiness and
[time=2179] silly talk or course jesting which are not fitting, but rather a giving of thanks.
[time=2185] For this you know with certainty that no immoral or impure person, darkness, or covetous man
[time=2193] who is an idolater has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
[time=2199] It won't happen.
[time=2200] There can be no darkness with light.
[time=2205] By nature of his character and by nature of who he is and by the nature of sin it can't happen.
[time=2211] 33, 20, God said to Moses, I know you want to, but he says you can't see my face.
[time=2218] For no man can see me and what?
[time=2222] What?
[time=2223] Live.
[time=2224] Yeah, the glory of God, the majesty of God, the purity of God is so immense and so big
[time=2231] and so huge.
[time=2232] The sinfulness of man can't even see his face because the sinfulness of man is so immense
[time=2239] and so huge and so manifest.
[time=2243] It doesn't work.
[time=2245] God's perfection is that great and here's where it's good I think for us to take a few minutes and we'll do this this morning, church.
[time=2253] It's good for you and me both to take in and consider here just for a moment the absolutely
[time=2260] true implications of sin.
[time=2266] I want to just give you a few things here.
[time=2269] On the unavoidable absolute implications of sin and I'm saying this to you who are young
[time=2276] and I am saying this to you who are old, I am saying this to those of you who are still trying to figure out what it means or even looks like to make a commitment to Christ and I'm saying this to those of you who have walked with him for decades.
[time=2290] I'm saying this to every person in this room, everybody watching live stream, those of you watching the Bible hour next week, listen, as you take this in here in just these few
[time=2301] minutes I want to just invite you to do something.
[time=2303] I want you to just think about you.
[time=2307] Just you.
[time=2308] I had a guy come up to me after first hour and say I really appreciated what you said about sin.
[time=2314] There were like three or four people I was thinking about who really needed to hear that and I knew a couple of them and he was right but I just said to him before I left I said hey did it apply to you and I know it applied to me.
[time=2329] It applied to me as I wrote these things down.
[time=2330] I struggle with many of these things in my own journey and want to get better at not
[time=2338] only understanding sin but I want to get better at moving away from it.
[time=2344] And so I would invite you this morning with me to just think about you.
[time=2348] Here is the absolute unavoidable truth about sin.
[time=2352] God can't be joined to sin because God is by his nature life giving and sin kills.
[time=2359] I hope you'll write that down.
[time=2361] Sin kills.
[time=2363] I want you to be reminded this morning that sin is terminal.
[time=2366] I want you to understand this morning that sin is violent.
[time=2370] I want you to understand that sin has only one aim in mind and that is death.
[time=2377] God is life giving and sin kills.
[time=2379] Now listen church, yes it kills eternally.
[time=2382] That's true.
[time=2383] Romans 6 says that the wages, what you earn, your paycheck, Romans 6 says your paycheck
[time=2389] for sin is what?
[time=2391] Death.
[time=2392] The wages of sin is death.
[time=2394] Yes sin kills eternally but make no mistake church.
[time=2398] Make no mistake sin kills now.
[time=2402] It kills now.
[time=2403] Sin will kill your dreams.
[time=2407] Sin will kill your opportunities.
[time=2411] Sin will kill your families.
[time=2414] Sin will kill your business.
[time=2415] Sin will kill your friendships.
[time=2417] Sin will stop at absolutely nothing to absolutely strip you by virtue of killing that which
[time=2425] you are hopeful for involved in or supposedly committed to.
[time=2431] God is life giving and sin has one aim and that is death.
[time=2435] Please understand the unavoidable implication of sin.
[time=2440] Secondly, God can't be joined to sin because God restores and sin ruins.
[time=2447] I hope you'll write that down.
[time=2448] God restores and sin because of its heritage, because of who it comes from, because of how
[time=2456] it was birthed, because of its whole make up.
[time=2459] Sin has a propensity.
[time=2461] Sin has a commitment to ruin.
[time=2464] I read this week, I've been reading the last couple of weeks about sin, I wrote this down from one of the guys, I read men are not punished for their sins, he said.
[time=2473] Men are not punished for their sins but by them, but by them.
[time=2482] Consequences of sin, the lifestyle of sin, the mindset of sin, please make no mistake, it punishes us.
[time=2490] It absolutely punishes us, it eats away at our spirit, it eats away at our souls.
[time=2497] God redeems, God makes new, God transforms, the psalmist said sin breaks our bones.
[time=2505] Sin ruins the body, sin depletes the soul.
[time=2511] Sin is destructive, God restores sin ruins, God is life giving, sin kills, thirdly because
[time=2518] God is truth.
[time=2520] God can't be joined to sin because God is truth and sin always what, say it, deceives.
[time=2526] Please understand because of its heritage, please understand because of its starting point, please understand because of the circumstances from which sin first came.
[time=2535] Sin has always been about lies.
[time=2539] And here's how it works.
[time=2541] Whoever you are, wherever you come from, whatever your background, whatever your lineage, whatever
[time=2547] your family journey, what happens is this, you've all got, myself included, we've all
[time=2553] got these weaknesses, we've all got these places in our life where we are especially
[time=2559] prone to temptation or struggle.
[time=2562] And what the enemy does is he pinpoints that area in your life and he paints a picture for you that is a lie about that.
[time=2572] He draws you toward it, he invites you into it and he promises you things that he'll never,
[time=2579] ever, ever deliver because he is a liar and sin is based on deception.
[time=2589] And I was thinking about it this week, I thought like what if we were working on a list?
[time=2596] And if we were going to come up with our top five lies of all time, what are the top five
[time=2603] sin lies of all time?
[time=2607] And my mind just kind of started going back and it was late, late 70s, I grew up in high school in the late 70s, early 80s was a big, big fan still am to a degree, but I understand
[time=2619] his flaws, big fan of Billy Joel.
[time=2622] And I remember being in my room with my Billy Joel album, vinyl, yes, young kids I'll explain
[time=2628] that to you someday.
[time=2630] It was a real album, I put it on the thing and I used to listen to Billy Joel and he used to say that he wanted to laugh with the sinners and cry with the who.
[time=2640] With the saints we got some Billy Joel fans in the room I see.
[time=2644] And then the next line of the song said this because sinners are much more what, fun.
[time=2652] If we were going to make a top five list of all the lies of all time, that would be in the top five, it's just an example for you.
[time=2659] Sin is fun.
[time=2664] Is sin fun?
[time=2674] And I just want you to think about that for a moment.
[time=2676] There are a lot of you in the room this morning and if you'll just chew on that for a moment
[time=2683] and if you'll chew on it enough to kind of in your mind get past the first 20 seconds,
[time=2689] all right, is it fun past the first 20 seconds, past the first couple of days?
[time=2701] How is it?
[time=2703] How is sin those six months that came after those 20 seconds?
[time=2711] I know people in this room, many of you and you've experienced the real aftermath of
[time=2717] sin, not just for 20 seconds or a few months, many of you have experienced the real aftermath of sin for years and years and years and I ask you, is it fun?
[time=2733] Hundreds of people in this room would stand in a courtroom today and under oath testify
[time=2739] to the sheer reality of the fact that that's a lie, isn't it, it's not fun.
[time=2750] God can't be joined to sin because God is peace, contentment, and joy and sin brings
[time=2756] only emptiness, shame, and regret.
[time=2762] That is the truth.
[time=2766] God brings peace, contentment, and joy.
[time=2769] Sin brings only emptiness, shame, and regret.
[time=2774] If you know that, would you just humbly say amen, amen.
[time=2779] And God really is, oh my friends, God really is life-giving.
[time=2784] He really does restore us.
[time=2786] He really can redeem your sinful heart.
[time=2790] This is the truth about sin today.
[time=2793] And he really can restore it and he really can redeem it.
[time=2797] It can be rescued and it can be revived.
[time=2801] And you say how?
[time=2802] And again, we're talking about the foundations of what we need to believe and what you need to believe about how that happens is number two, the only remedy for sin.
[time=2813] You see it there on the screen, the only remedy for sin and thus the only route to proximity.
[time=2818] Relationship with God is Christ.
[time=2821] The person of Christ, the sacrifice of Christ, the substitutionary death of Christ.
[time=2827] But if we walk in the light, verse seven, but if we walk in the light as he himself is
[time=2834] in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus, his son, cleanses
[time=2840] us from all sin.
[time=2841] I want you to go back up to verse six.
[time=2844] I want to explain something to you quickly.
[time=2846] I'm not going to do this every week.
[time=2848] Believe me, this will come up every week in our study.
[time=2852] I want to try and explain it right here in this first little salvo.
[time=2858] And then if we got to come back to it again, maybe we will, but please don't miss this.
[time=2862] There's something very unique about a reading or study of 1 John and it comes right to the
[time=2868] forefront right here in verse six and seven here.
[time=2871] Watch this.
[time=2872] It says in verse six.
[time=2873] See if you can pick it up.
[time=2874] It says in verse six.
[time=2875] We have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness.
[time=2879] We lie and do not practice the truth.
[time=2885] If I read that in the English like I just did, that's very problematic.
[time=2889] Can you just raise your hand if you get what I'm saying?
[time=2893] Because yeah, because what that said in the English is if I say I'm in, but I sin, I'm
[time=2903] out.
[time=2904] That's kind of what it just said.
[time=2906] And so that can be a little confusing and that can get people to question their faith and that can be really uncomfortable and hear me.
[time=2914] I don't want to be too quick to ease your discomfort in this study, but I do want to say this about that and you'll see it all through first John.
[time=2923] That is written in the Greek.
[time=2924] Here's where I talk a little bit about the Greek.
[time=2926] Don't do it usually unless it's really helpful.
[time=2929] And I think it's really helpful here in the Greek.
[time=2931] This is written in what's called the present tense, the present active.
[time=2935] And anything written in the present active tense, if we say we have fellowship with him
[time=2942] and yet walk in darkness, present active tense.
[time=2947] That means if you say you have fellowship with him and the ongoing habitual continuing
[time=2956] to decline, think of a graph kind of going up into the right.
[time=2961] If the ongoing regular hard-hearted just, this is really bottom line who I am.
[time=2968] If the regular pattern is just more and more and more sin, more and more and more movement
[time=2975] away from him, no dips, no journeys back to repentant, no, no, it's just if the pattern
[time=2981] is you're walking in sin and you keep walking in sin and there isn't really any break in
[time=2988] that present active in your trouble.
[time=2994] That's what this is saying.
[time=2995] And if that makes you feel uncomfortable today, I'll let you wrestle with that.
[time=3004] What we see in first John and we'll see it more even this morning is that certainly you're going to sin, I do, you do, but what we want to see is a present active ongoing pattern
[time=3016] of, oh no, I've sinned, I don't want to sin, I want to come back here and I want to make
[time=3024] things right, I want to do whatever I've got to do to not move in that direction.
[time=3028] If what I see or what you see in my life or what I see in yours is this ongoing pattern
[time=3034] of not really wanting to be marked by or characterized by that, that's a good thing.
[time=3040] And that's what this is talking about, I hope that made sense.
[time=3045] Christ, only remedy, His finished work, the only solution, please understand church, your
[time=3053] desperate efforts to clean yourself up aren't what get you in, please understand your desperate
[time=3060] attempts to somehow please Him and look good for Him will never work because what Christ
[time=3069] did and who Christ is today, God looks at you, believer, Christian, follower of Jesus,
[time=3077] God looks at you, He sees who, Christ, and see you, Christ covers you, Christ is what
[time=3086] God sees when He views, observes, and watches you, two very important principles here to keep in mind, the substitutionary sacrifice of Christ saves you from your sin eternally.
[time=3100] Please be reminded of that this morning, the substitutionary sacrifice of Christ saves
[time=3106] you from your sin eternally, He is the only remedy and there is an eternal forever consequence
[time=3114] to sin.
[time=3115] It is serious, it is so very serious, it's why Genesis 2, 17, God talking to Adam before
[time=3121] Eve ever came along, He says to Adam, if you eat it you will what, die.
[time=3128] Please understand and I'm not apologetic about this, I don't get all weirded out by this, I think God has the right to design this thing, however God chose to design it and God's design on this front my friends is that sin requires death.
[time=3142] Sin required a sacrifice, sin equaled you die and that's the way it was from the very
[time=3150] beginning.
[time=3151] Thank God, Arlen referenced it this morning, John the same John wrote about it back in the Gospel of John 3, 16, "For God so loved you and me that he gave his only dear begotten
[time=3163] son that whosoever believes, test of doctrine whosoever believes on him shall not what,
[time=3169] shall not die." He is the only remedy, saves you from your sin eternally, secures for you a right relationship
[time=3181] with God today.
[time=3182] What do I mean by that?
[time=3183] He secures for you a right relationship with God today.
[time=3187] Well, because of what Jesus did to your sin, because He canceled it, because He removes
[time=3193] its stain and power, He forgives all past, all present and future sin, all of it is done forever completed.
[time=3201] Now God can be in proximity to you, your sin takes you away from God, your sin before Christ
[time=3207] took you away from God, your sin every day takes you away, does God go anywhere, yes or no?
[time=3213] No, God stays right there, but He can't be in proximity, your sin propels you away from Him and because of what Christ did, only remedy for proximity, you now get to come back and
[time=3225] you get to come back through this thing called confession, the again and again willingness,
[time=3232] the again and again discipline, the again and again readiness in you and in me to do what 1 John 1 9 says, if we confess, we have an advocate, we've got a propitiator, we've
[time=3242] got a substitute, if we're willing to confess our sin, He is faithful and just to forgive
[time=3249] us of our sin.
[time=3251] Number three, I hope you'll write it down, number three, the way to experience the forgiving work of Christ as it relates to our sin, is to confess our sins.
[time=3262] Now I want you to be honest about this as we close, most of us Protestants, when we hear the phrase confession, when we hear people talk about confessing, when we hear any teaching
[time=3274] or any discussion about confession, most of us think of who, most of us think of Catholics.
[time=3282] We think about priests and a dark booth and a guy behind a screen.
[time=3286] Now watch this and we've got so many hang-ups with that whole picture theologically, watch
[time=3292] what we've done, we've subsequently rejected the priestly function of mediating forgiveness,
[time=3298] I understand that, and then we've promoted in response and highlighted the generous gift of God's grace in Christ realized privately.
[time=3309] We want to make sure we note that privately and personally, we've made such a big deal
[time=3316] about the generous gift of God's grace and how it's realized privately and personally.
[time=3322] And as a result, we've diminished our view of and stripped away really our need for confession.
[time=3332] Me confessing my sin to you.
[time=3336] We've diminished it privately, we've diminished it corporately, we've diminished it in community.
[time=3346] I've personally suffered from this pattern of thinking in my own life.
[time=3353] Many of us in the room today have passed along to our families.
[time=3356] I believe a weak view of the priority of regular, honest confession.
[time=3364] And when you pass along a weak view of confession, I believe you're then culpable for passing
[time=3370] along a weak view of what?
[time=3374] Of sin.
[time=3376] Because if confessing it's no big deal, then over time it becomes no big deal.
[time=3385] And the truth about sin this morning you and I have seen is that it's a very big deal.
[time=3393] And so we should confess.
[time=3395] You can take their theology, some of our Catholic friends.
[time=3401] You can take their theology and you can do what you will with it.
[time=3404] I understand some of the problems there.
[time=3406] But I'll tell you this, I have Catholic friends and we have Catholic family.
[time=3412] And on the issue of confession, I've never seen more faithful people who every single
[time=3420] day more than you and more than me, every single day, forget about their theology for a second, every single day they wouldn't dream of going to bed without making sure they went
[time=3433] and confessed their sin.
[time=3438] And so you and I should take note, you and I should understand that the truth about sin is that it's huge and God's given us a remedy, it's Christ.
[time=3447] And the way we get to experience that is through confession.
[time=3449] And I can't wait to keep going in our study.
[time=3451] We got to go times late, but I'm grateful for what we're getting to see and wrestle with and understand.
[time=3456] And I hope you'll be back next week as we continue to make our way through this book.
[time=3460] Would you stand and let me pray for us as we go Father in Heaven.
[time=3463] We're grateful for what we've seen this morning.
[time=3470] Psalmist said, "I acknowledged my sin to you and my iniquity I did not hide.
[time=3477] I said I will confess my transgressions to the Lord and you forgave the guilt of my sin."
[time=3484] I just want to remind you this morning church, sins one thing, please understand you don't
[time=3490] have to live with the guilt of your sin, that in confession and because of Christ, the guilt
[time=3497] of your sin, the shame of your sin, the consequence, the ongoing drip, the ongoing reminder.
[time=3504] You don't have to live with that.
[time=3507] When you come before Him and you confess what went wrong, He is faithful and just to forgive
[time=3513] you, the psalmist says even the guilt of the sin let alone the sin itself.
[time=3518] God thank you for your word and its encouragement this morning.
[time=3522] Bring us back again next week for more from it.
[time=3524] Be with us as we go.
[time=3526] Help us too with your strength and power.
[time=3528] Take down high places in our lives and in this world.
[time=3531] And everybody agreed with the prayer and said, God bless you, we'll see you soon.
