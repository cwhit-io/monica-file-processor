[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Hey everybody, welcome to the broadcast.
[time=33] Again, it's great to have you with us week after week.
[time=36] We are so thankful that you continue to tune in.
[time=39] I'm grateful for these few minutes that we get to be together here in this setting.
[time=44] And I'm really praying about, I have been for the last few days, really hoping that God will use this message, the message you're about to hear, in a way that will absolutely transform, change, and encourage you in your relationship with the Lord.
[time=60] If you don't have a relationship with the Lord, if you keep tuning in and you really haven't come to that point yet where you've drawn that line in the sand that we talk about, put that stake in the ground that says I'm in.
[time=73] I'm fully surrendering my heart and life to Christ.
[time=76] I wanna just encourage you to continue to open up your heart and mind to the reality that that is in fact what God wants you to do, that He is longing for you to take that step, to be willing to see the fact that your sin, like with all of us, our sin separated us from God.
[time=94] There is no sin in proximity to God and it is the gift of Christ.
[time=101] It is His sacrifice on the cross, His defeating death as He rises again out of the tomb, it is all that Christ did that allows you and I to now defeat death and have a relationship with God.
[time=115] And I hope and pray that's something that you'll do soon.
[time=119] I hope and pray that if you want some help with that, that you'd call us and let us talk that through with you, I hope and pray you'll come on a Sunday morning and come down front afterwards and talk with me and let me help you think that through.
[time=133] Let me be with you as you pray that prayer and communicate with God your desire to be in relationship with Him.
[time=141] We don't wanna ever lose sight of the fact that really this is what all of this is about.
[time=146] We're trying to do our very best through the power of God's word and the power of His church.
[time=152] We're trying to reach people who desperately need His Son.
[time=156] And so I hope this morning if that's you, you'd allow us the privilege of introducing you to Him.
[time=161] I'm really grateful that you tuned in.
[time=163] If we can help at all, please call us at this number.
[time=167] Go to our website, there's ways on our website that you can contact a pastor.
[time=172] We would be more than happy to help lead you to a life-changing, eternity-altering relationship with God and His Son forever.
[time=182] I'm so thankful that we got the chance to have these moments together, thankful that you tuned in.
[time=188] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=190] God bless.
[time=192] [MUSIC - 235 seconds]
[time=431] Man, thank you, man.
[time=441] (audience applauding) [AMEN] It's an awesome God that we're serving.
[time=447] Oh, understatement, I know.
[time=450] Greeders, would you come forward at this time?
[time=453] Church, we're getting ready to take our tithes and offerings.
[time=456] If you're visiting with us, thanks for being here.
[time=458] Just let that plate pass on by.
[time=461] Would you guys let me pray for the offering?
[time=464] God, you are so good.
[time=469] We never let go.
[time=472] You're always there.
[time=476] We can't thank you enough for that.
[time=479] Lord, you gave us everything.
[time=485] All that we have is yours.
[time=487] We're just as that you had blessed these gifts
[time=493] that we give to you this morning, that it would be for your glory, for your kingdom.
[time=500] You would just be lifted high, and your name would be made famous.
[time=505] God, we love you.
[time=509] And you loved us first.
[time=513] We praise you that you come down to us, that you're near to us, that you hear us.
[time=521] When we call, we answer.
[time=527] Be glorified.
[time=532] Be glorified this morning in everything that we saw today.
[time=536] [AMEN] Well, good morning, Blackhawk family.
[time=540] I hope the morning's going well so far.
[time=542] It is, I am away this week as you can tell, but when I'm away, I'm not worried at all about what goes on at Blackhawk.
[time=550] Our teaching team and our worship team, and all that goes into a Sunday morning week after week, I know in my heart is going to be well done.
[time=559] It's going to be God honoring.
[time=561] It's going to be inspiring and encouraging to you, so I know you're having a great morning.
[time=566] I also know that the speaker this morning isn't one of our normal preaching team members.
[time=571] He is a good friend of Blackhawk.
[time=573] He is a good friend of mine.
[time=575] He is a guy who has made an investment in terms of ministry and the kingdom of God.
[time=580] I can't think of many in the entire region.
[time=584] In the 17 years I've been here, I can't think of a guy who's made probably a deeper and broader investment than Luther Whitfield.
[time=593] Pastor Luther Whitfield from New Covenant, and for years and years, part of the YFC team that's been reaching youth for Christ and investing in them and instilling a love for the Lord into them, and Luther's been doing kingdom work here in Fort Wayne.
[time=612] He's been doing it at a national level with YFC.
[time=615] He's done it at an international level, but every time he comes back to Fort Wayne, this is his home, this is his community, and he has made an incredible kingdom difference in this place, and he's made a huge difference in my life.
[time=630] And so I'm grateful that he's here.
[time=632] We partner with New Covenant often on a number of different things.
[time=637] Good Friday would be the last one we did with them together, but I tell you what, he is a collaborative force in my own life.
[time=643] I'm thankful for what I've learned from him.
[time=645] I'm thankful for what I see in him, and I can't wait for him to share with you this morning what God has put on his heart.
[time=652] So Luther, little brother, thank you for being here.
[time=655] Thanks for being a friend to Black Hawk, and thank you so much for your willingness to come and serve our family today.
[time=662] Black Hawk, would you give Luther a warm, warm Black Hawk welcome.
[time=667] Now that is what you call truly a big brother right there.
[time=680] This big brother on string and everything, big brother.
[time=684] Will the Lord bless you today?
[time=686] And if you are glad to be in the house of the Lord today, let's give Jesus a round of applause like we.
[time=693] [AMEN - 6 seconds]
[time=701] The Lord is good, and it is an honor to be with you, the Black Hawk family.
[time=708] We bring you greetings from New Covenant worship center, and we are excited this morning to have the privilege and the honor to share with you today.
[time=718] Let's go to the Lord in prayer this morning.
[time=721] Father, in the name of Jesus, we glorify you, and we magnify you today.
[time=728] We thank you, Father, for your presence, and for your spirit in this place.
[time=733] And Father, we pray today that your people will see very little of Luther, but all of you.
[time=739] I pray today, Father, that you would hide me behind the foot of your cross.
[time=743] Lord, help me to decrease, that you might increase.
[time=747] Father, today I pray that my words will be your words, my thoughts will be your thoughts.
[time=754] Every movement, every gesture, would reflect you in every way.
[time=759] And even now, Father, we bind the hand of the enemy.
[time=762] We rebuke the powers of darkness.
[time=765] We plead the blood of Jesus over this time, and we thank you for your presence that fills and occupies this place.
[time=773] So Father, this is your time.
[time=776] Have your way in this place move freely and about.
[time=780] And Father, certainly, when it's all said and done, we, your people, will give you all the praise, all the honor and the glory.
[time=788] For you and you alone are worthy of it.
[time=791] For we pray these things in Jesus' name, and all God's people said amen.
[time=797] [AMEN] 1 John chapter 2, a few of the following verses.
[time=809] Our brother, Pastor Kelly, was telling me that you guys have been journeying together in 1 John.
[time=816] And this morning, I'm going to attempt to continue to guide you through that process.
[time=823] 1 John chapter 2, once you find it, you will find these words.
[time=829] My little children, these things I write on to you that you send not.
[time=835] And if any man's sin, we have an advocate, Hallelujah.
[time=840] With the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous.
[time=845] He is the propitiation of our sins.
[time=849] Not only ours, only, but also the sins of the whole world.
[time=856] Whereby we do know him, and if we keep his commandments.
[time=863] He says, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments is a liar.
[time=869] And the truth is not in him.
[time=872] But who so keepeth his word in him barely is the love of God perfected.
[time=880] Whereby know we, that we are in him.
[time=884] He saideth, he abideth, and him, ought himself also walk, even as he has walked.
[time=896] [AMEN] Some historians would say that at this juncture in John's life,
[time=906] they would say that at this point he is around a hundred years old.
[time=913] And John has journeyed from church to church throughout the region of Asia minor,
[time=920] which is known today as this present day Turkey.
[time=925] It's upon hearing the news of John's arrival at the various churches that the people would indeed flock to the church.
[time=935] They wanted to hear this incredible, this elaborate speaker.
[time=942] I mean, who really, when you think about it, would want to hear John.
[time=947] Particularly at that time, because John was the last living apostle.
[time=954] He was the last of the gang of twelve that Jesus himself had handpicked and appointed.
[time=961] And every time John would come and he would stand in the various churches amongst the magnitude of people that was there, I can only imagine John like I am this morning as I looked out at you and John would get up and he would stand in front of that vast crowd of people.
[time=978] And he will say to them as he had other time and time before little children love one another.
[time=990] It was always somewhat his introduction, because there was no doubt that John would probably
[time=996] utter those words because throughout his gospel John describes himself as the apostle whom Jesus loved.
[time=1005] He is characterized as the apostle of love.
[time=1009] Not because Jesus literally loved John more than he loved any other of the twelve that he had with him.
[time=1017] But John would say that the reason he calls himself the apostle of love
[time=1023] is because John first hand understood just exactly how much God had loved him.
[time=1033] Because when John would look over the backdrop of his life John would probably say I would probably be the least lovable.
[time=1041] John would probably say that because John in his years of living before Christ,
[time=1048] John was a hothead, a quick tempered individual.
[time=1054] Matter of fact, Mark records the fact that at one time when John was with the twelve in Jesus
[time=1060] and they were going through a certain region of Samaria and they refused to receive the ministry of Jesus,
[time=1066] John snapped.
[time=1069] John said listen, call down some fire and kill them people.
[time=1076] John didn't play.
[time=1079] Don't worry, I'm not praying for fire to fall.
[time=1083] I'm just praying for a great move of God.
[time=1087] And John said listen, kill those people.
[time=1092] But as John continued to journey on with Jesus and began to follow Jesus,
[time=1102] John became more like Jesus when he came to loving people.
[time=1109] And that's what rivets me to this text this morning.
[time=1114] Because when you look at first John, it just gives us this incredible, beautiful picture of what God gives you
[time=1123] and I as his children.
[time=1126] As you and I journey through this life here on earth, there are just some things that the Lord has put in place
[time=1134] for you and I, those of us who believe in him.
[time=1138] I love the fact when you look at first John, John simply says this.
[time=1142] John says my little children, these things are right unto you that you sin not.
[time=1150] I love the fact that John simply calls us once again, like he did time and time again as he stood in front of the vast crowd of people.
[time=1158] Once again this morning are the words of John ringing my ear and he calls us little children.
[time=1164] I'm glad this morning that he identifies me this morning as a child of God.
[time=1170] I'm grateful this morning because what John says to you and to me that we're not just some group of individuals
[time=1177] that gather here at Black Hawk and worship God and that's about the limit of this experience that we have with the Heavenly Father.
[time=1186] But when John lets us know that we're more than that, that we are part of the body, the family of God.
[time=1194] And therefore he calls us little children, we're part of the family today.
[time=1200] And that's a blessing to me this morning to know that today this morning I'm part of the Heavenly family.
[time=1208] And that it doesn't matter what I may do, what mistakes I have made in my past.
[time=1215] If I stumble and fall today, that he loves me enough that he doesn't reject me nor kick me out, but I'm still part of the Heavenly family.
[time=1227] Little children today, little children.
[time=1233] He lets us know that we're part of this incredible family of God.
[time=1238] But not only are we part of this incredible Heavenly family, but what John also lets us know is that he gives to you and I as children of God this incredible warning.
[time=1253] He lets us know almost like a mentor or father, he lets us know, he shares with us, be careful, be careful that you don't sin.
[time=1265] He lets us know that there are things that are in this world, there are things that will threaten our relationship with the Father.
[time=1277] So John stands before that illustrious group, and he gives this incredible group of children that love the Lord, he warns them to not.
[time=1287] God yourselves, heed to the word of God, strive to become more like him with every fiber of your being.
[time=1297] God yourself from sin.
[time=1303] But John also understood the frailty of our humanity.
[time=1309] He understood that in this life that we are going to make mistakes.
[time=1317] He was naive to the fact that even those of us who claim that we love him, that we don't sometimes trip up and that we sometimes may fall.
[time=1331] He's aware of our frailty.
[time=1335] And yet he lets us know that even when we fall, even when we make a mistake,
[time=1345] even when we stumble along life's way, he lets us know that you have an advocate in Christ Jesus.
[time=1356] Hallelujah.
[time=1358] Hallelujah today that I have a defense attorney representing me in the courtroom of glory today.
[time=1367] That when Luther makes a mistake, when Luther falls, my attorney stands before the Father, and he is advocating on my behalf.
[time=1385] And I have a good attorney.
[time=1388] I want you to know I have a good attorney.
[time=1392] I don't know about you, but my attorney have never lost the case.
[time=1398] He's a good attorney.
[time=1400] He's well able to represent me in the courtroom of glory because he has done what was necessary to satisfy what the judge need in my life.
[time=1414] He's my propitiation.
[time=1418] He has carried the righteous in the nation of the Father.
[time=1422] He's carried your sins and my sins on that cross.
[time=1427] And because of his work on the cross today, you and I now have a righteous relationship with the Father, not because of what we've done, but because of what he did on the cross at Calvary.
[time=1441] I got a great attorney today, so that when Luther falls, and when Luther stumbles along life's way, he reminds the Father that I'm still his child, and that I've been washed under the blood of the lamb, and that he abides and lives within me.
[time=1467] And I'm grateful this morning that nothing can take away that from me.
[time=1473] It doesn't matter what people think, nor what people say, it doesn't matter who comes in and who comes out of my life.
[time=1482] I'm still part of the heavenly family because of what Jesus did for me.
[time=1490] [AMEN] So John does, John, John, let's us know that you and I have this intimacy with God, that when you and I obey his commandments, there is this incredible intimacy with God.
[time=1507] And the more we obey his commands, the more we become like him, and the more we obey him, it proves our love for him.
[time=1519] He says, "For those who love me will keep my commandments." And those who simply don't, they're lying.
[time=1529] They don't know me.
[time=1532] And yet, John's sensitivity helps us to understand that when we do make a mistake, we're still part of the family that he doesn't give up on us.
[time=1548] The part of this scripture verses, these six scripture verses that hits me so hard is that John lets us know that even though we are forgiven, and that we have an incredible advocate in Christ Jesus, he lets us know that we don't get a green card or we don't get this freedom to live any kind of way that we want.
[time=1577] That we are children of God.
[time=1580] If I was back in New Covenant, I would simply say to the congregation, don't think that just because we have an advocate in Christ Jesus, and he's done and paid the price for us, he was our perpetuation, that that gives you and I the freedom to sin and simply say, "God, forgive me."
[time=1598] If I was back at home, I would say to the congregation, don't think you can pump God out.
[time=1605] He doesn't play that.
[time=1608] He's too wise for that.
[time=1612] So what John does for us is that he warns us church, he warns us to sin not because he clearly understands that there are forces that will come to drive a wedge between you and our relationship with the Father.
[time=1633] I started thinking about that immediately, and I started thinking about who in the world best represents that, who in the world from Scripture could paint a picture of someone who allowed his own selfish desires drive a wedge between him and the Father.
[time=1653] And clearly the individual that came to my mind with Samson, he's among many who allowed himself to have a wedge driven between the Father, but Samson sticks out so clearly to me.
[time=1666] Because when you study the life of Samson, Samson is someone who just appears to have so much going for him.
[time=1676] I mean the very fact that he is born as a miracle child, it blows me beyond recognition.
[time=1684] The fact that he is born into a Christian family, a God-fearing family.
[time=1690] The very fact that God had anointed him and had a purpose for his life every since birth rivets me to the text.
[time=1701] The very fact that he was a gift not only to his parents, but to the nation of Israel.
[time=1708] To judge and defend and to protect its people.
[time=1714] And yet with all that going for him, all Samson had to do was submit to the voice and the will of God, like many of us.
[time=1729] What failed Samson is the fact that his worst enemy was the enemy that was within himself.
[time=1739] And isn't that like life because sometimes our worst enemy is not the people on the outside, but the enemy within.
[time=1748] Samson refused to deal with his weakness.
[time=1753] And because he won't deal with his weakness, his weakness evidently dealt with him.
[time=1761] I mean journey through the life of Samson in this short time that we have together.
[time=1766] I mean think about it for a moment.
[time=1769] I mean when you look at this man's life and you just follow scripture that speaks of Samson's life, it's amazing to some of the stuff that you see.
[time=1781] I mean in chapter 13 alone, he despised his heritage.
[time=1788] I mean simply of just simply obeying God, Samson chooses to do his own thing.
[time=1798] Instead of heeding to the voice of God, heeding to the command of God.
[time=1802] In chapter 13 we shall see that Samson clearly is about Samson.
[time=1810] About doing what appeases him and his own appetite.
[time=1817] You begin the journey to chapters 14 from verses one through four.
[time=1822] You see that he defiles his parents.
[time=1826] He doesn't listen to his parents.
[time=1831] Samson is choosing to appease his appetite when it comes to the opposite sex.
[time=1841] He's committed to become unequally yoked with someone outside of his face.
[time=1849] In chapter 14 verses 5 through 20, he defiles his body.
[time=1854] You remember the story?
[time=1857] How he hungers for honey and he gets it from a dead carcass of a lion.
[time=1865] Not only does he defiles his body, but he disregarded God's warning.
[time=1870] Because in chapter 15, God gives him just this room of victories.
[time=1875] But yet after each victory, he reminds Samson that Samson, you're pulling away, you're becoming weak.
[time=1885] And it's something when God speaks to us.
[time=1888] And yet we fail to hear and hearken to the voice of God.
[time=1892] It's as if God is looking and he's telling Samson, Samson, if you don't deal with this thing, I'm telling you,
[time=1899] it will pull you away from me.
[time=1904] Samson doesn't hearken.
[time=1907] He doesn't heed.
[time=1910] Then finally in chapter 16, we see the climax of Samson's life.
[time=1917] Because now Samson has become so desensitized to the very voice in the presence of God,
[time=1924] that the Bible says that he goes down to Gaza.
[time=1932] And yeah, I tell you the truth, he does go down.
[time=1935] He goes down geographically and he goes down spiritually.
[time=1941] And there at Gaza, he finds her.
[time=1946] He says, "If the enemy has set him up for this incredible fall, because there she is in Gaza,
[time=1954] this elupshoe is this beautiful woman by the name of Delilah."
[time=1961] Her very name means one who entices.
[time=1965] Now, church before you and I begin to pick Samson apart, let me share something with you.
[time=1971] Don't trip on Samson this morning, because if true for to be told, all of us have a Delilah.
[time=1980] All of us have something that the enemy dangles in front of our face to get us to somehow some way
[time=1986] to walk away from what the Father has been telling us to do.
[time=1993] The question is this morning, what's your Delilah?
[time=1999] What's keeping you from following the Father to the best of your ability?
[time=2004] What's your Delilah this morning?
[time=2007] The danger sometimes with us in church is that we come to church and we wear such a mask because we fail to recognize
[time=2014] we don't want no one to know that we're wrestling with something or we're struggling with something or we're dealing with some issues and so therefore we come to church and we wear our sanctified mask and in the inside there's turmoil going on.
[time=2028] What's your Delilah this morning?
[time=2032] Because maybe by divine providence the Father has brought you to this place to give you the same morning
[time=2038] that he has given Samson.
[time=2042] What's your Delilah this morning?
[time=2046] You know the story eventually Samson is so desensitized.
[time=2054] He is not even aware that she is a hired assassin hired by his mortal enemies the Philistines.
[time=2067] Phil Samson like some movie that we have seen in theaters he finds himself sleeping with the enemy
[time=2076] and he's not even aware of it.
[time=2080] But look what he'd lose.
[time=2085] Look what it's lost because he refused to obey the word and the command of God.
[time=2093] He is so desensitized church that number one he's not even aware that his hair is cut from his head.
[time=2101] So desensitized.
[time=2103] I mean good Lord I shave my head every day.
[time=2107] And one little nick make me hollow.
[time=2111] And yet somehow this incredible man of God is not even aware that this woman is shaving his head
[time=2119] and his hair was symbolic of his dedication to God.
[time=2124] So desensitized that he has fallen away from the Father and John reminds us of the danger of sin.
[time=2136] So desensitized that he loses his strength.
[time=2145] He's so ignorant to the fact that his strength is gone until that very moment when the Philistines come in
[time=2155] and slam him to the floor.
[time=2158] His strength is gone.
[time=2162] Matter of fact the word is Ichabod.
[time=2165] The glory of the Lord has departed.
[time=2168] The presence of God.
[time=2170] The power of God.
[time=2172] And maybe there's some of us that said that place today.
[time=2175] That at one time you and I were on fire for God.
[time=2178] We were doing great x voice for the kingdom of God.
[time=2181] But somehow, someway we drifted y'all.
[time=2187] And the strength and the joy and the excitement is gone.
[time=2194] He loses vision.
[time=2197] It's vision.
[time=2199] They gouged out his eyes.
[time=2204] He can't see living in other darkness.
[time=2213] No vision.
[time=2216] It's as if someone has drained him of his hope.
[time=2220] His future is bright tomorrow.
[time=2225] He loses his freedom.
[time=2228] Freedom because now he's bound to brass shackles and chains.
[time=2234] And not only does he lose his freedom because he loses his usefulness.
[time=2241] Because now instead of defeating the enemies of God.
[time=2245] Every day he is moving a millstone and grinding corn for the Philistines.
[time=2253] And whenever you and I walk away from the command in the will of God.
[time=2257] When we become disobedient to the voice of God.
[time=2259] You and I fall into the same state.
[time=2265] To the very end he loses his testimony.
[time=2269] He becomes a laughing stock to the Philistines.
[time=2277] But here's the hallelujah to the rest of that narrative.
[time=2282] The hallelujah is because maybe one day.
[time=2284] Maybe it was that that day when he was once again grinding at the millstone.
[time=2290] That maybe Samson remembered his God.
[time=2298] And it maybe was at that point that Samson begins to pray.
[time=2304] Maybe it's at that point that he asked for forgiveness.
[time=2309] And that's the part that I love because Scripture says that if we confess our sins.
[time=2316] God is faithful and just to forgive us of all our sins.
[time=2320] And church I tell you this morning that's why I love them.
[time=2324] Church I tell you that's why I love them.
[time=2326] Because no matter how much I screw up I'm grateful today that I serve a God of a second
[time=2332] and a third and a fourth chance that he doesn't kick me to the curb.
[time=2336] But he gives me another opportunity to get it right.
[time=2343] The hallelujah.
[time=2345] Samson has messed up but yet God has not forsaken him.
[time=2352] They parade him into a temple to praise their God.
[time=2358] And that Samson has changed from the length of his arms to his waist.
[time=2365] He stands there between two pillars.
[time=2370] And Samson once again prays a prayer to his God.
[time=2374] And he asks his father to help him to once again to defeat his enemies.
[time=2381] And at that moment the Bible records that on that day Samson killed more Philistimes
[time=2392] than he ever in his life.
[time=2395] The tragedy is churches that Samson dies with the Philistines.
[time=2400] And I could hear someone this morning say well Pastor Luther then did what's the moral of the story.
[time=2407] I mean you've been preaching to us that we have an advocate.
[time=2410] You've been preaching to us that we have someone who was our propitiation.
[time=2414] You've been preaching to us all this stuff but yet Samson dies with him.
[time=2419] The blessing for me today is to know simply this church is that God has put these types of stories in the Bible
[time=2428] so that you and I have the awareness of knowing that we don't have to fall into the same trap.
[time=2436] The blessing I have to know is that we have the awareness that when we sin there is still yet consequences to our sin
[time=2445] but he doesn't kick us out of the kingdom.
[time=2450] And I believe today that Samson is in the kingdom.
[time=2454] And I'm blessed today to know that by reading and understanding the life of Samson I don't have to make the same mistake.
[time=2462] That today when I confess my sin he is faithful and just to forgive me.
[time=2469] And the added benefit that I have is that I have an attorney in glory every day who is pleading my case before the Father.
[time=2479] And so today I don't find it a grudgery to serve him.
[time=2487] I consider it an honor to serve him.
[time=2491] It's an honor to serve someone who has loved me so much that he was willing to carry all my sins so that I can be adopted into this heavenly family.
[time=2505] And for that this morning I give him praise.
[time=2509] That this morning I give him my life.
[time=2512] That this morning I'm willing to become all that he would have me to be.
[time=2517] And I pray this morning that's the same for you.
[time=2521] That as his children you walk as children obedient to the voice of God.
[time=2527] That you might continue to be used for his kingdom.
[time=2531] That you might continue to dream dreams.
[time=2534] That you might be able to be to be strengthened and to be a witness to others of the kingdom of God.
[time=2541] You and I today are blessed to have a Savior who loved us so much that he was willing to die.
[time=2548] And yet continue to speak on our behalf before his Father.
[time=2552] I give him praise today for all that he has done.
[time=2559] And he continues to do for me.
[time=2563] Let's pray.
[time=2566] Father in the name of Jesus we glorify you today.
[time=2572] And Father we thank you.
[time=2577] That Father in life we will have our struggles.
[time=2583] We will make mistakes.
[time=2587] But Father you love us so much that you don't give up on us.
[time=2592] But Father you continue to stand on our behalf.
[time=2597] And so Father today for the times that we have aired.
[time=2603] For the times that we have slipped up and messed up will you forgive us today.
[time=2610] Father will you wash us under your blood.
[time=2614] Cleanse us today that we might be the children of God that you would have us to be.
[time=2621] Father we want to be a witness to you in this world today.
[time=2625] We want to be used today for your glory.
[time=2629] Father we dedicate ourselves to you.
[time=2634] So Father continue to guide and lead us.
[time=2639] We honor you today.
[time=2642] We love you today.
[time=2645] Not just as members of Black Hawk or New Covenant.
[time=2649] But we love you today as your children.
[time=2653] As one church.
[time=2655] As one body.
[time=2658] We love you today.
[time=2660] Thank you Father for all that you're doing.
[time=2663] Thank you for all that you continue to do.
[time=2666] And thank you for all that you're going to do in the days to come.
[time=2670] I pray your blessings upon my brothers and sisters today.
[time=2674] Use them Father. Use them like never before.
[time=2679] And certainly Father when it's all said and done.
[time=2683] I know for sure I'll give you all the praise.
[time=2686] All the honor and the glory.
[time=2689] For you and you alone are worthy of it.
[time=2692] In Jesus name and all God's people said amen.
[time=2697] Come on the Lord bless you today amen.
