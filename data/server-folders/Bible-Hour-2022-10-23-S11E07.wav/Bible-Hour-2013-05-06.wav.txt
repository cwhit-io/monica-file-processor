[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, good morning and welcome again to the broadcast.
[time=34] It's great to have you with us.
[time=35] And I want to say a special welcome to those of you who are mothers in the audience.
[time=39] By the time most of you watch this, obviously Mother's Day will have come and gone.
[time=43] But this morning, as the Blackhawk family gathers, we gather with a few things on our hearts and minds, not the least of which is how grateful we are, how thankful we are for our mothers.
[time=55] There are young ones, there are old ones.
[time=57] There are those of you who are right in the middle of it all.
[time=61] And to every single one of you, we want to say how thankful we are.
[time=65] I asked Karen Beck to join me this morning.
[time=68] You'll see our time together on stage in the broadcast today.
[time=73] Karen is a good friend, really a mentor to me.
[time=76] Her and her husband, Tim, have been caring for and walking alongside my wife, Deborah and I, for all 17, 18 years here in Fort Wayne.
[time=86] Karen and Tim are shepherds here at Blackhawk.
[time=89] They oversee and help care for people who are in our small communities.
[time=93] And Karen has a huge ministry with women and moms and wives.
[time=98] And I want you to listen today, as she talks about some of what she encounters when she sits with and spends time discipling and encouraging and mentoring moms and wives.
[time=110] She's a wonderful lady, a great friend and God has given her great insight.
[time=114] I hope what you hear today will encourage you.
[time=117] That's what I hope.
[time=118] I know as a mom, sometimes you can be discouraged.
[time=120] We want to encourage you as a mom today.
[time=123] I hope this helps.
[time=123] I hope it lifts your spirits and more than anything.
[time=126] I hope it points you back to the one source of strength and the one source of direction that you as a mom most desperately need.
[time=133] And that is our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ and His Word.
[time=138] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=139] We love getting to spend this time with you.
[time=142] We hope you'll come by and see us sometime.
[time=143] Have a great week.
[time=145] God bless you.
[time=146] Take care.
[time=147] (upbeat music)
[time=176] [MUSIC - 42 seconds]
[time=221] (upbeat music)
[time=232] [MUSIC - 92 seconds]
[time=326] (upbeat music) - Happy Mother's Day indeed.
[time=345] We wanna just take a few moments and celebrate and encourage you moms.
[time=350] And so if you would please, I'm gonna probably have you do this twice and I'll explain that in just a moment.
[time=355] But if you are a mom here today, young one old one in between doesn't matter.
[time=360] Would you just stand right where you are?
[time=361] Just go ahead and slip up out of your seat there.
[time=364] And if you just stand right there for a moment, I wanna first of all say to each and every one of you that what you just saw on the screens, we really believe is true.
[time=373] We affirm it and we wanna say it to you this morning.
[time=376] Thank you, thank you for loving, thank you for teaching, thank you for modeling, thank you for encouraging, thank you for staying at it, thank you for being moms who day in and day out, continue to offer what only you can offer.
[time=391] Young kids and teenage kids and older kids, your faithfulness to this endeavor of mothering is one that we are very grateful for.
[time=400] And as a church family, let alone your family.
[time=403] I know your family has enormous plans for the day.
[time=408] Your church family wants to say thank you.
[time=411] And we wanna just bless you this morning by honoring you and showing you just outwardly how grateful we are.
[time=416] So everybody, would you please thank these moms.
[time=419] (audience applauding) Awesome.
[time=424] All right, you can have a seat for now.
[time=426] Here was what happened yesterday.
[time=428] I'm driving around thinking about how I really wanted to say that and I really mean all of that.
[time=434] I also, as I'm driving, I'm just getting the sense that there are a lot of moms in the room who while I know they'll be grateful for our applause and our thanks, I know there's a lot of moms in the room who don't feel like good moms.
[time=452] I know that there would be moms this morning sitting in these seats who feel like they have failed.
[time=461] Who feel as if their struggle or their choices or their difficulty has done more damage than good.
[time=470] I know that there are moms in the room young and old who get weary sometimes if not being all that in your heart you wanna be and all that you know God has called you to be.
[time=482] And so I stand up here and I say you're the greatest thing in the world and we all clap and you're sitting there going wow, I don't feel like I'm the greatest thing in the world.
[time=490] And so I ask Karen to come.
[time=494] Karen Beck, her husband Tim, have been a part of our family here at Black Hawk for years.
[time=498] For 17 years, Karen and Tim have walked alongside in a very intimate and personal and encouraging way our family.
[time=507] Karen and Tim have mentored and discipled and loved and cared for the birds in good days and in bad ones.
[time=515] And Karen sits with, spends time with and comes alongside women of all ages just as part of her everyday life.
[time=524] It's part of God's calling on her life.
[time=526] She disciples and cares for gals and she sits and talks with a lot of moms.
[time=530] And I just called her last night and said,
[time=536] hey, would you be willing to just share with our family?
[time=539] What do you hear when you sit with moms these days?
[time=542] What do you sense them wrestling with?
[time=546] And how could we encourage them this morning?
[time=549] Just briefly, we're gonna get to first John.
[time=551] But how could you briefly just encourage them?
[time=553] And so I just asked her to share a few things and she's gonna do that right now.
[time=557] - I listen to great joy and great sorrow.
[time=564] I listen to heartache, absent fathers.
[time=567] It's been porn, there's been adultery, rebellious children.
[time=572] I listen to women that they're just worn out, worn out from working and trying to manage a home and a big world that you live in.
[time=582] Expectations have changed tremendously since I grew up and was raising children.
[time=589] Yet even then, there was this sense that if you do A, B and C, you're gonna get D, E and F.
[time=596] And there was this great longing.
[time=599] Motherhood's a pretty thankless job.
[time=602] It's the most sacrificial thing you'll ever do.
[time=604] And there was this just longing to have my children rise up and call me blessed.
[time=611] And I remember when our children first left home and lived around the world, actually.
[time=616] And our oldest son could never really figure out when my birthday was or when Mother's Day was.
[time=621] And so I got a call from him in Brazil to say Happy Mother's Day.
[time=626] And I thought, "Kevin, how did you know it was Mother's Day?" And he said, "Oh, Tommy emailed me." "Well, really, what did he say?" And he's not discerning enough to just pass it off.
[time=637] He rifles through his emails and he said, "Oh, here it is.
[time=641] "Dear mom, dear bro, I just thought I'd give you a heads up.
[time=646] "Sunday is Mother's Day, so give big red a call "or experience her wrath." (audience laughing) And it just was such a life changer for me, realizing I lived under this expectation for our children and then that disappointment and that heartache that would come.
[time=664] And as I work with women, there's just a sense of loneliness and marriage and parenting as you allow the world to inform you and tell you what you should be doing and shouldn't be doing.
[time=677] There's isolation in friendship.
[time=680] I looked at those scriptures from Ruth and saw all those women gather around Naomi and Ruth when that child was born and celebrate with her and say, "Oh, he is the restore of life and the redeemer." And many, many women are doing life alone in the hard places.
[time=698] Peter tells us that we have everything we need
[time=704] for life and godliness.
[time=707] His precious promises, his word, his power is ours.
[time=712] When I look at the life of Mary, that God chose a woman to bear his son like wow, she got to be a mom and she felt wonder.
[time=728] She was controlling.
[time=732] She was afraid.
[time=734] She grieved.
[time=737] She was misunderstood.
[time=739] She stood at Calvary and watched her son be crucified.
[time=744] And yet she was among the women that Jesus said, "Go wait in Jerusalem for my power to come, for my spirit to come." And there she was counted among those 120 people as one who was praying and waiting.
[time=765] We can't do anything without God and without his word to sustain us.
[time=773] I draw great comfort from God's image that he gives us of himself, male and female.
[time=781] But the words in Isaiah 49 say, "The Lord has forsaken me.
[time=787] The Lord has forgotten me." Do you ever feel like that?
[time=790] You're all alone.
[time=792] Nobody really knows what you're living in.
[time=794] The hardship of that goes on to say, "Can a woman forget her nursing child and have no compassion on the son of her womb?
[time=803] Even those may forget, but I will not forget you.
[time=808] Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands.
[time=813] Your walls are ever before me." I don't even think we could forget our children.
[time=823] There's such a deep love and attachment to them.
[time=827] But even if that were possible, God can't forget you.
[time=832] It's not possible.
[time=834] Your concerns are written on his heart.
[time=837] Your name is on his hand and guess what?
[time=841] So are your children.
[time=843] God is for you and he will, to the end of the age, pursue you and make his love known to you and fill you with encouragement and hope through his word and through his people, through the power of his spirit.
[time=862] So I encourage you to find strength and hope in his word and then in the body of believers.
[time=869] It's life-changing.
[time=870] - And everybody agreed and said, amen.
[time=877] Hey, listen, if you would just everybody bow your heads and close your eyes, you can join us really as a family in this prayer.
[time=886] And I'm gonna just ask again now.
[time=888] I'm gonna ask as I start to pray here for mothers, if you're a mom in the room and it is a struggle for you today.
[time=899] And quite honestly, you do battle with feelings of failure.
[time=904] You battle with this feeling of not being all that you should be, maybe even today.
[time=910] There's a sense where you're wrestling with disappointment and concern and you're just not sure you're handling it well.
[time=917] Maybe you know for certain that you're not.
[time=920] If you feel today like you could really use just the touch of the Holy Spirit and the encouragement from God, we wanna do our best to just pass that along to you.
[time=932] So stand this morning.
[time=933] If you're a mom in that spot, I just wanna invite you to stand.
[time=937] It doesn't mean you're guilty.
[time=938] It means you're a mom.
[time=940] It doesn't mean you haven't arrived.
[time=942] It means we're still in process.
[time=944] So please, any mom in the room that you could just use some encouragement today, let us pray for you.
[time=951] Just give you a second here.
[time=952] Anybody else wanna stand?
[time=954] And we wanna just pray this prayer for you this morning.
[time=957] Oh Father in heaven.
[time=958] We are so grateful for each and every mom in the room.
[time=963] God, those who stand right now, stand because they sense a need in their heart.
[time=968] They want to be encouraged.
[time=969] They wanna touch of your love and your reminder.
[time=973] And God, I think about what Karen just said, how they gathered waiting for the outpouring of your spirit.
[time=978] And I pray God this morning that your spirit would be poured out on these mothers.
[time=984] That they would sense a newness of strength, a fresh reminder of your calling on them.
[time=989] Oh God, I pray that they would trust you.
[time=992] I pray that as they parent young ones and teenagers and older kids, I pray that you would give them the ability to do that with great grace and with great courage and with great love.
[time=1004] God, for those who are even physically weary today because of what they face, I pray that you would lift them up.
[time=1011] I pray that they would sense not only your presence but your strength.
[time=1015] Oh God, I pray that for the moms in the room who need encouragement, as they relate with their husbands, I pray that you would cover them with your grace and your mercy that they could pass that grace and mercy along to him in whatever ways they can.
[time=1029] God, thank you for these ladies who stand.
[time=1032] I'm grateful for the forgiveness that you've brought.
[time=1034] I'm thankful for the lives that you've given them.
[time=1036] And I pray today as their pastor and friend, that you would give them great courage as they walk forward today in your son's name we pray.
[time=1045] [AMEN - 1 seconds] Thank you ladies.
[time=1048] Would you all thank Karen for being here with us?
[time=1050] (audience applauds) Well, we come back this morning to first John.
[time=1057] Would you open your Bibles please today to first John, chapter two, verses 12 through 14.
[time=1064] First John, chapter two, verses 12 to 14.
[time=1067] And let me begin with this, Jim Callahan.
[time=1072] Jim Callahan had worked hard and smart for years
[time=1078] on the finance side of the IT industry.
[time=1081] And while there had been some lean years and a few bad professional decisions along the way, the last 10 years for Jim Callahan had been nothing shy of a screaming success.
[time=1093] He and his team had run point on a number of large-scale mergers and acquisitions and the only thing bigger than Jim Callahan's reputation on the corporate front was Jim Callahan's paycheck.
[time=1107] Opportunity for Jim Callahan wasn't knocking at his door.
[time=1111] Opportunity was begging at his door.
[time=1114] The skies were blue, the coast was clear, smooth sailing was the only forecast one could predict for Jim Callahan.
[time=1122] Sally Callahan was a Sunday school teacher and an advocate for the homeless in her community.
[time=1129] She was the life of the party, a big-hearted kind life of any party.
[time=1135] She was a young 52.
[time=1137] With energy oozing out of her on all fronts, she had been married to Jim for 32 years.
[time=1143] And while raising their two sons had taken up much of her time and focus over the years, in recent years with the boys gone from home and married, her focus had landed on the always exciting import-export business.
[time=1156] She had invested heavily in a new venture and over the span of the past two years, those that knew her couldn't believe the staggering success.
[time=1165] She and the company were experiencing.
[time=1168] Her clientele was expanding radically and internationally.
[time=1172] Her hours were increasing and the bottom line was multiplying exponentially as the days went by.
[time=1178] She and Jim were beginning to do things for themselves.
[time=1183] They were beginning to provide things for others and they were beginning to dream about a future that no longer seemed fairy-tailish.
[time=1191] Now it seemed doable.
[time=1193] Now it seemed real.
[time=1195] All predictions were up and to the right.
[time=1198] And yet no one could or would have ever predicted what happened next.
[time=1205] On a summer afternoon, after a morning of missed meetings and texts, calls and emails that had been uncharacteristically ignored, Jim Callahan's assistant found him dead in the workout area of his private office suite.
[time=1223] He had hung himself with wires flung over the top of a weight machine and below his limp dead body was a detailed note outlining years of marital infidelity, sexual addiction and the fathering of five children with four different women, all of whom were about to pursue legal action that would reveal and expose every sorted heart-breaking detail.
[time=1247] When the authorities traveled to the Callahan's home in the private gated community of Brookstone to inform Sally Callahan of her husband's death, they were both shocked and confused.
[time=1261] As were the neighbors to see her being led from the front door of their Mediterranean-style mansion in handcuffs.
[time=1270] You see the staggering successful import export business had been a front for an international drug and money laundering ring run by mafia types in Eastern Europe and fully administered and overseen state side by Sally Callahan, who 14 months later was found guilty on numerous counts and sentenced to 40 years in prison.
[time=1294] How does that happen?
[time=1299] How is it that that transpires?
[time=1306] Why was, question, why was the reality for the Callahan's and the reality for the Callahan's was that last two minutes there?
[time=1317] Why was the reality for the Callahan so very different
[time=1323] than what it could have been?
[time=1325] Strike that, what it should have been.
[time=1327] Why was reality for the Callahan so different than what it should have been?
[time=1335] For all intents and purposes, they should have been full of hope, they should have been full of promise, they should have been full of a future, but instead, they were either dead or behind bars.
[time=1346] What happened?
[time=1349] We'll come back to that.
[time=1355] Three truths this morning about the family of God.
[time=1361] I don't want you to miss a single one and I want you to make sure you stay with me.
[time=1365] We're gonna get back to that story and I think it's gonna make some sense to you.
[time=1369] We'll just stand in honor of God's word.
[time=1371] Let me read this to you, please.
[time=1373] First John chapter two, verses 12 to 14.
[time=1375] I'm writing to you, John says, I am writing to you little children because your sins have been forgiven you for his name's sake.
[time=1386] I'm writing to you fathers because you know him who has been from the beginning.
[time=1391] I'm writing to you young men because you have overcome the evil one.
[time=1396] I have written to you children because you know the father.
[time=1400] I have written to you fathers because you know him who has been from the beginning.
[time=1404] I have written to you young men because you are strong and the word of God abides in you and you have overcome the evil one.
[time=1414] John, who's been all about so far, he's been all about testing our faith.
[time=1422] There was all kinds of stuff going on culturally, all kinds of worldly philosophical influence was starting to infiltrate.
[time=1429] So John stops and he says, wait, I'm going to give you your faith in clear written form in the most basic fundamental way possible.
[time=1437] And he says to all of them and he says to us today, test yourself doctrinally and morally.
[time=1443] Test yourself all the way through first John, but he comes to this little three verse section and he pauses on the testing and he wants to just reaffirm and restate what this can look like.
[time=1458] And I want you to see this and I want you to think about this with me, what this should look like for us and the family of God.
[time=1466] You can be seated.
[time=1466] First thing he says, first truth.
[time=1473] You ready?
[time=1474] Three truths about the family of God, the first truth right there in verse 12.
[time=1478] Would you look at that with me?
[time=1479] It says in verse 12, I am writing to you little what?
[time=1483] Say it church out loud.
[time=1484] Children, I am writing to you little children.
[time=1488] Now again, before you think he's kind of going toddler on us, before you think he's talking to the second graders, that word children in the Greek there is the word technia and the word technia isn't toddler, the word technia is child of God.
[time=1504] Anybody, everybody in the room who has bowed the knee of your heart, anyone who has fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ, whether you're 10 or whether you're 90, little children is this endearing phrase that John used to basically talk to everybody.
[time=1525] So here he's talking to everybody and here's the first truth.
[time=1529] Well, let me finish reading that.
[time=1530] I'm writing to you little children because your sins, all of you, your sins have been forgiven.
[time=1536] Your sins have been forgiven you for his name's sake.
[time=1541] John pauses in the testing to reaffirm the central truth that he thinks everybody in the room needed to hear.
[time=1550] And here's the first, here's the first truth.
[time=1553] You ready?
[time=1554] Yes, children of God, we can all have the great peace.
[time=1557] Write this down.
[time=1558] As children of God, all of us, we can all have the great peace of knowing we have been forgiven.
[time=1570] And to owe how important this is that you would know this and that you would understand this and that you would live like this.
[time=1580] As children of God, we can all have the great peace of knowing we have been forgiven.
[time=1587] That is truth number one.
[time=1589] Truth number two, you see it right there in verse 13.
[time=1593] He goes on, "I am writing to you fathers." The Father there isn't necessarily biological.
[time=1601] The Father word there in the Greek is describing a demographic.
[time=1606] And the demographic that's being described, the demographic that's being spoken to in verse 13, listen, is all the older's.
[time=1614] It's all the older, wiser, older in age.
[time=1618] Yes, those who have seen more life, those who have been around longer.
[time=1623] He says to the fathers, he says to the older's because you know him.
[time=1629] I'm writing to you fathers because you know him who has been from the beginning.
[time=1636] You know God.
[time=1638] You have walked with God.
[time=1640] You have known the one who from the beginning has been with and for his people.
[time=1646] You have seen him at work.
[time=1648] You have watched him do his mighty deeds.
[time=1651] You have experienced his touch.
[time=1653] You have seen him doing his kingdom work.
[time=1657] He says to those who are older, "I'm writing to you because you know him." As fathers or older's, you have the great security.
[time=1668] It is available to you.
[time=1671] The great security of a faith anchored in God's past faithfulness.
[time=1677] This is truth number two about the family of God.
[time=1681] Somebody said it this way, older people.
[time=1683] You have a potential to have a wisdom seasoned by the past, which makes for a steadfast faith in the future.
[time=1693] There's a lot of older people, I know.
[time=1696] And I look at them and I watch them as they deal with and encounter heartache or difficulty or challenge.
[time=1702] And the steadiness with which they face it, the calm resolve with which they tend to approach these situations.
[time=1710] It simply reminds me, this steadfast faith in them reminds me of all that they must have seen and all that they must have encountered and all that they must have seen God do over the years.
[time=1721] A wisdom seasoned by the past makes for a steadfast, steadfast faith in the present.
[time=1731] I will admit this, there was a time years ago when friends of mine, and I say this because I know many of you in the room are trying to figure out if you're older or not.
[time=1742] There was a day years ago, Bob and Nancy will remember this as will others of you.
[time=1748] I used to give my friends the hardest time when they turned 50 because I had declared, just, you know, I just declared 50 was old.
[time=1756] So once you hit 50, I just said, listen, you're now in the older category, get used to it, live with it, deal with it.
[time=1763] I want you to know my mind has changed about that recently.
[time=1767] And I don't think 50 is the deal anymore.
[time=1770] Now I think 60, okay?
[time=1772] We'll just say 60 is that older, wiser category.
[time=1776] I'm just kidding, I'm okay being older.
[time=1779] Now watch this.
[time=1781] One was the children of God.
[time=1784] First group was everybody.
[time=1787] Now if any talks to fathers, he talks to the older's in the room and says something very important to them.
[time=1793] Then he talks to younger's, okay?
[time=1796] Now we're talking to 50 and under's.
[time=1798] Now we're talking to teenagers.
[time=1800] Now we're talking to 20 somethings.
[time=1801] Now we're talking to 30 year olds.
[time=1803] And you find this there in 13.
[time=1805] Go back to the text, look what it says.
[time=1807] He addresses young people.
[time=1808] He says, I'm writing to you.
[time=1810] This is the second part of verse 13.
[time=1812] I'm writing to you young men and that can be young ladies as well.
[time=1816] I'm writing to you young people because you have overcome the evil one.
[time=1823] You have overcome the evil one.
[time=1826] It's not in future tense you might.
[time=1829] He says here you have.
[time=1831] With great confidence there were young people who were overcoming the evil one.
[time=1837] Then look at verse 14.
[time=1838] It says in verse 14, again, second part of the verse, I have written to you young men, young women because you are strong.
[time=1848] And the word of God abides in you.
[time=1850] And you have overcome the evil one.
[time=1852] There is this picture that he paints.
[time=1855] It can be a reality of young people who are strong and the word of God abides in them.
[time=1862] And they overcome the evil one.
[time=1865] Truth number three as youngers, both young men and young women, you have a great capacity to overcome the evil one with a strength birthed from the word of God.
[time=1876] I hope you'll take that to heart.
[time=1880] I hope you'll write that down as a believer in Christ, young man, young woman.
[time=1885] You have been given the capacity to overcome the evil one with a strength birthed from the word of God.
[time=1893] So we get this picture.
[time=1895] And my mind is I'm reading that and you'll see it on the screen here.
[time=1898] So there's this picture that gets painted and it isn't some pie in this guy thing.
[time=1902] It's reality.
[time=1903] The family of God really can be, really should be comprised of three groups of people.
[time=1911] We've got everybody in the room who the quality of our life and the way in which we live, there should be this clear and strong sense that we are forgiven.
[time=1921] There is this older segment of us and the clear message that the older segment should give off is that they are seasoned and mature.
[time=1931] And then there is this third section of us, younger people and the clear message that should be given, the clear reality that should be seen as younger people who are just strengthened.
[time=1942] Strong in their commitment, yes, but strengthened as it said there in the text because of their devotion to the word and the truth of God.
[time=1954] So I'm thinking that through and I'm looking at that picture right there and I'm thinking, you know what I love that?
[time=1961] I know that's what he wants and I know that's what he designed.
[time=1965] Why then? I just wrote this down.
[time=1967] Why then do so many in the church today?
[time=1971] Why then do so many live in shame?
[time=1977] Why do so many, all of us, group one,
[time=1984] why do so many of us live in shame and not forgiveness?
[time=1990] Why are there so many olders who are characterized, not by a seasoned maturity, but by immaturity?
[time=1998] I'm so thankful, I'll say this.
[time=2002] I'm so grateful at Blackhawk to have been here all these years and by and large lived in relationship with so many olders who were so kind and so mature and so seasoned.
[time=2018] Every once in a while, we'll get one going sideways, but for the most part, the olders in this place, I think have been incredibly mature, but there are issues and it's good that we address it and put it out there on the table.
[time=2032] The fact is that so many times in the church today, there are so many people who live in shame instead of forgiveness, they live in immaturity, not seasoned wisdom, and there are so many youngers marked by weakness, compromise, instead of strength.
[time=2048] Back to the Callahan's, why?
[time=2053] Why is it so very different, really, than what it should be?
[time=2058] And I'm asking you, why do you think it is so very different
[time=2067] than what it should be?
[time=2069] It should be forgiven, seasoned, strong, and yet too many times it's living in shame and immaturity and weakness.
[time=2081] Here's something for you to consider.
[time=2085] I believe there's a number of answers.
[time=2088] I believe there's one very important answer that I want to suggest to you this morning.
[time=2094] The answer, here's a hint, the answer to all three questions, why the shame, why the immaturity, why the weakness.
[time=2102] There's one answer that I think fits all and it's the word inputs.
[time=2105] I hope you'll write that down, inputs, inputs.
[time=2108] I believe, I believe our inputs.
[time=2112] I believe what we're hearing.
[time=2114] I believe the messages that we've received and continue to receive.
[time=2119] I believe the philosophy of the day, just like in Ephesus when John wrote this thing.
[time=2125] I believe the philosophy of our day.
[time=2127] I believe the messages that we hear.
[time=2129] I believe the things that are being said.
[time=2132] I think the stuff that's getting subtly and overtly communicated, I think inputs.
[time=2137] The things that come into your heart and mind every single day and they've been coming into your heart and mind, some of you from the day you were born.
[time=2146] I believe inputs, faulty inputs, worldly inputs,
[time=2152] ungodly inputs, foolish inputs, destructive inputs are wreaking havoc in our faith and in our living.
[time=2164] And I want to just give you an example.
[time=2168] I kind of try to figure out which one of the three should we talk about this morning.
[time=2172] Should we talk about the family of God and how we're supposed to live forgiven, but the truth is too many times we live in shame.
[time=2182] Self-hatred.
[time=2183] I thought about older people and how they're supposed to be mature and gracious and kind and patient.
[time=2192] And yet sometimes that just gets flipped around and you get grumpy old people who aren't kind and aren't gracious.
[time=2199] And then I thought, I mean, I thought about the kids and how the word of God says they can live, they can.
[time=2206] They should live in strength.
[time=2207] And yet too many times kids today are living in weakness and compromise.
[time=2212] And I thought, which one should we look at today?
[time=2214] I want you to know, I picked the first.
[time=2216] And I want you to see how inputs have absolutely demoralized the foundation
[time=2226] of what I believe God wants us to think on this thing.
[time=2228] Let's go back to what he said in verse 12.
[time=2231] He says, children, all of us, right?
[time=2233] Every person in this room, every one of you watching on live stream, everybody tuning in audio wise, everybody in earshot of my voice, understand that if you know the Lord, if you have fully surrendered your heart and life to him, he says, I am writing to you little children because your sins, all your failures, all your iniquities, all your shortcomings have been forgiven.
[time=2258] Say that word, church out loud, forgiven, forgiven, forgiven you for his namesake.
[time=2265] So here's my question for you.
[time=2269] We're gonna start right here.
[time=2270] Why do so many loved, redeemed, blessed, empowered children of the living God live in the ghetto and poverty of shame and self-hatred?
[time=2294] and self-hatred?
[time=2296] Let's look at the input of God first.
[time=2301] We'll start there.
[time=2302] I want you this morning to just stop for a moment and be reminded of God's input on this subject matter, this idea of forgiveness.
[time=2312] You ready?
[time=2313] Micah 7, 18 and 19, you'll see it on the screen.
[time=2317] Micah 7, 18 says, who is a God like you?
[time=2321] Be reminded of this this morning, church, all of you, whatever it is you're facing, wherever your mind goes, when we talk about past sins and current failures, who he says is a God like you who pardons iniquity and passes over the rebellious act of the remnant of his possession.
[time=2338] He does not retain his anger forever because he delights in unchanging love.
[time=2346] Goes on in verse 19 to say, he will again have compassion on us.
[time=2350] He will tread our iniquities underfoot.
[time=2354] Yes, you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea, the deepest parts of the sea where no one goes and no one sees where there's nothing down.
[time=2367] He casts your sins in mind.
[time=2370] He tosses them underfoot.
[time=2372] He casts them into the deepest parts of the sea.
[time=2375] Micah 7, 18 and 19, this is God's word.
[time=2378] This is God's input for you regarding whatever it is you did.
[time=2384] Or whatever it is you keep doing.
[time=2385] He goes on in 1 John 1, 9, we looked at this a couple of weeks ago.
[time=2391] 1 John 1, 9 says, if we confess our sins, if you're just willing to say to him, it's true.
[time=2399] I did this, I thought this.
[time=2402] I made this choice if we confess it to him.
[time=2405] He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us, scrubbed white is what that means.
[time=2414] Absolutely washed, to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[time=2418] This is God's input to you regarding your failure and your sin.
[time=2422] It goes on, look at Hebrews, I love this one.
[time=2425] Hebrews 10, 17 says, and their sins and their lawless deeds, I will what?
[time=2431] Say it, I will remember no more.
[time=2435] This is one of the places where we get this clear picture of how utterly, vastly different we are from God.
[time=2442] You and I don't forget a thing, do we?
[time=2445] You and I don't forget, we don't forget a wrong.
[time=2449] You know and I know 20 years later, I remember what she did.
[time=2458] You and I are absolutely, if we could remember calculus, like we remember offenses, we'd all be magna cum laude.
[time=2469] We forget our Spanish, but we don't forget, we don't forget what you did to me, do we?
[time=2477] God forgets it.
[time=2480] Think about it, God with this mind so beyond yours and so beyond mine, he can't remember your sin.
[time=2490] He can't even picture it, he can't even recall it.
[time=2497] It says, he says, he forgets it.
[time=2501] It's gone, it's into the deepest part of the sea.
[time=2506] He doesn't function like you and I do, he doesn't function with this stuff right there.
[time=2511] In front of him, you think he walks around with a scorecard, he doesn't have a scorecard because he can't what, he can't remember.
[time=2519] This is the input of God to his children.
[time=2527] On the issue of forgiveness.
[time=2530] And I love Acts 3, Acts 3, 19 says therefore, repent and return.
[time=2537] Agree with God about your sin, repent and return.
[time=2542] Keep moving forward so that your sins may be wiped away in order that times of refreshing.
[time=2550] I love that phrase, in order that times of refreshing, we so don't live like this on this front, this front of sin and God's forgiveness and our shame.
[time=2562] Oh my goodness, we are racked by, we are burdened by, we are absolutely brought down by and he wants us to live in times of refreshing so that those times may come from the presence of the Lord.
[time=2578] God's input, God's word, listen church, his truth given to his people on this front says that from murder and adultery and sexual sin, fraud, abuse, addiction as well as gossip over spending
[time=2596] and over eating, all of which are heinous, awful sins.
[time=2601] The Bible says that in fully surrendering to the person and sacrificial work of Christ, you are forgiven.
[time=2609] You are forgiven.
[time=2612] Completely made clean, thoroughly restored, washed.
[time=2616] Time and time again, forgiven, forgiven, forgiven, forgiven, beautifully cleansed, pure in God's eyes, whole and made new, that's God's input.
[time=2631] But, but your drunk stepdad, after he would beat you,
[time=2642] called you worthless, he called you worthless again and again and again.
[time=2650] Or your mom screamed things at you that no person should have to hear.
[time=2656] An ex-spouse was relentless in her criticism of you.
[time=2661] An ex-spouse was relentless in his dismantling of you
[time=2667] because of all your faults and failures.
[time=2669] Satan himself, the enemy whispers in your ears daily the same degrading messages with the same destructive inputs.
[time=2680] Two diametrically opposed inputs regarding you
[time=2686] and all your failure, God's truth, you are forgiven.
[time=2692] You are thoroughly and completely made new.
[time=2699] You were at the time of conversion and you are every single time you come to him, he makes you new again, he remembers nothing.
[time=2708] The slate really is clean, this is God's input, this is what you're faced with today or the enemy's input which says it's a lie.
[time=2718] You're a sick, worthless, good for nothing center who will always be that way and there isn't anything you can do live with it.
[time=2728] You're disgusting.
[time=2729] And law bump into people, sit with people every day,
[time=2738] every week.
[time=2739] I hear people articulate in so many words that, that lie.
[time=2744] And I want to say to you today, I want to say to you what the Apostle John said to those in Ephesus and the church in that day, I want to say to you this day, I'm writing to you little children because your sins have been forgiven.
[time=2765] Your sins have been forgiven you for his name's sake.
[time=2771] Which one will you listen to?
[time=2774] Which one will you act on?
[time=2777] Too many times, way, way too many times.
[time=2785] In this day, we see professing believers who are figuratively speaking in terms of how they're living and choosing, we're seeing believers in the church again and again and again hanging themselves.
[time=2800] Too many times today in the church we see believers being let out the front door and handcuffs.
[time=2807] Too many times we see believers living in the bondage of a reality that wasn't at all intended.
[time=2814] How does this happen?
[time=2815] How do people who could have so much oftentimes live
[time=2822] as if they have nothing?
[time=2824] And I'm telling you this morning on this front, as it relates to forgiveness, as it relates to living in shame, I'm telling you this is the input.
[time=2834] And when you live by this input, little children, when you live by this input, older people, older people, this says you're to be dignified, older people in the room, this says that you're to be temperate, this says you're to be patient, this older people, this says that you're to interact with younger people in a loving patient, caring, mentoring, respectable way.
[time=2860] Younger people, this is your input.
[time=2864] This says that you can choose and that God is willing to help you choose a life of purity, a life of abstinence, a life of character, a life of integrity.
[time=2875] Young people, this is your input.
[time=2878] And when this is your input, then we don't hang ourselves and we don't get let out in handcuffs.
[time=2883] No, we live lives of victory.
[time=2885] We live lives not perfect lives, but we live lives of meaning and purpose.
[time=2889] And so today really is one point, take this one home with you.
[time=2894] The one point we're making here is this, that what John says to the family of God in this little brief parentheses in this whole book of tests, he stops right here and says this is what it can be like.
[time=2906] And I believe that.
[time=2910] And I hope you understand me this morning, the only way it's gonna be that way is when your input, believe me, the enemy's input, every single day, family, elders, youngers, the inputs are catastrophic.
[time=2923] They are absolutely more than we can count.
[time=2927] They're coming at you from the left and from the right.
[time=2929] They're coming at you fast and furious.
[time=2932] And so we encourage you today and we commit to stand with you and we commit to give you this input that would allow, I think, us to be the family of God, the family that God designed.
[time=2945] I'm gonna ask Adam to come back up with a team and I'm gonna ask you to pray with me this morning.
[time=2950] Oh Father in heaven, we're about to respond to you and worship this morning.
[time=2954] We're about to lift our voices again.
[time=2956] And I pray so God that we would do it in a way that would be a crying out from your people, your family, the elders in this room, the youngers in this room, oh God, I pray, that we would come back again and again to your truth that can guide us, your truth that can inform us, your truth that can strengthen us.
[time=2977] Oh, may our input be the very words of God that give us life and give us direction and give us hope.
[time=2984] God, thank you for the chance to remember these things this morning and thank you now for the chance to respond and song.
[time=2991] We do so, God, with all of our hearts and all the room agreed with the prayer and said, amen, would you stand and let's worship our God together?
[time=2999] (gentle music)
