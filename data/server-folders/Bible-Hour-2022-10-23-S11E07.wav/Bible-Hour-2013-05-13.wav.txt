[time=445] - I'm so encouraged to be with you today.
[time=448] Let's take a little detour as we start.
[time=452] If you have your Bibles, would you go to Song of Solomon?
[time=455] I don't know if you know this or not.
[time=456] We sing that song a few times, that song you won't relent.
[time=460] It's actually taken from the Song of Solomon.
[time=463] And it's in chapter eight.
[time=465] And I wanted just to read verses six and seven of chapter eight.
[time=468] Song of Solomon is a book about the beauty and goodness of marital sexual love.
[time=475] It's a celebration of it.
[time=477] It's a treatise about it.
[time=479] It's a beautiful book to read.
[time=483] It is a book that is very, let's say, very descriptive.
[time=489] Put it that way.
[time=489] Song of Solomon, chapter eight, verses six and seven.
[time=494] Remarkable verses.
[time=497] I may have mentioned this before, but I just feel like I wanted to talk about this again.
[time=501] Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, then Song of Solomon, tucked away in the Old Testament.
[time=507] So Job, keep going to Psalms, keep going to Proverbs, keep going to Ecclesiastes, then Song of Solomon will be right there.
[time=515] It's pretty much in the middle.
[time=517] Pretty close.
[time=517] Those verses say this.
[time=520] Song of Solomon, chapter eight, verses six and seven.
[time=522] Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is strong as death.
[time=531] Jealousy is fierce as the grave.
[time=535] Its flashes are flashes of fire, the very flame of the Lord.
[time=541] Only place in the whole book that God's name shows up is in that verse.
[time=545] Many waters cannot quench love.
[time=547] Neither can floods drown it.
[time=549] If a man offered for love all the wealth of his house, he would be utterly despised.
[time=556] This kind of relentless, special love.
[time=561] There is a picture in Song of Songs.
[time=566] Song of Solomon of the way that God loves his people.
[time=569] It is a picture.
[time=570] Song of Solomon has never not been in the Bible.
[time=573] It's always been there.
[time=574] And so we read it through that lens, that it is about a man and a woman who love each other in marriage, and they have physical intimacy.
[time=581] But there is an echo.
[time=583] There is a picture of a specific love that God has for his people in all of these words in some way, and I am always overjoyed to sing that song because it reminds me how much God loves, and he doesn't have to.
[time=598] We're gonna be in first John this morning, first John's in the New Testament, way at the back.
[time=603] So the very last book of the Bible is called Revelation.
[time=605] First John is right before second, John.
[time=607] You're welcome.
[time=609] That way, way, way at the back.
[time=610] So head there if you would please.
[time=612] We're gonna talk about three verses today.
[time=613] First John chapter two, verses 15 through 17.
[time=616] I get assigned verses to talk about with you guys, and I'm always grateful when I get something that's digestible.
[time=625] I got three verses.
[time=625] I can do that.
[time=626] I can talk about three verses.
[time=628] I'm grateful.
[time=628] As we begin this morning, let me ask you to imagine a phone conversation in which you were talking to a friend.
[time=637] You say, "Hello, how are you?
[time=640] "Hey, John, how are you?" And then we're in the conversation, he goes, "Wow, look at that trunk." Now, if I wasn't there with John, I wouldn't know what he was talking about.
[time=650] He could be at the circus.
[time=652] He could be standing in front of this thing here, this box that we call a trunk.
[time=657] He could be looking at the back of somebody's car.
[time=659] I wouldn't know because I wasn't there with him.
[time=662] Look at that trunk.
[time=664] Context is really, really important.
[time=668] 'Cause the word trunk means lots of different things.
[time=671] In 1 John chapter two, verses 15 through 17, John uses a word as he opens there that needs to be carefully explained.
[time=682] The context that we all live in is gonna, what is the trunk?
[time=686] Is it this box?
[time=688] Is it an elephant's nose?
[time=690] Is it the back of a car?
[time=691] What is it?
[time=692] The only way I know was to get myself involved in the context to actually be there with Sean and know what it is he's looking at.
[time=699] It's kinda like what we see in John's letters.
[time=700] We have one side of the conversation.
[time=703] So what does John mean when he says in chapter two, verse 15, I'll ask you guys to stand as we read these three verses, just three.
[time=713] I think a fundamental question for us guys
[time=720] is what does John mean when he says this?
[time=721] Do not love the world or the things in the world.
[time=726] If anyone loves the world, the love of the father
[time=732] is not in him.
[time=734] For all that is in the world, the desires of the flesh, the desires of the eyes and pride and possessions is not from the father, but is from the world.
[time=745] And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever, you may be seated.
[time=756] I think it's really important to talk about
[time=762] what's the world?
[time=763] What is he talking about in verse 15?
[time=766] You might remember another thing that John said in John 3 16, same guy, John wrote both letters.
[time=771] First John in the gospel of John, he said, for God, finish it with me, for God so loved the world.
[time=778] So the same word like the word shrunk in a different, has a very different meaning.
[time=783] God loved the world so much that he gave his son in a beautiful exchange.
[time=789] So what does John mean in chapter two, verse 15?
[time=794] When he says, do not love the world.
[time=796] Well, the word world is actually a word, the word cosmos in the original, sounds familiar.
[time=801] It can be different things in different places.
[time=804] There's an outline in your bulletin.
[time=805] If you'd like to follow along, there's some notes there that hope are helpful to you.
[time=808] This is really strong language.
[time=813] And I admit to you guys that this passage makes me very uncomfortable.
[time=817] And I love that.
[time=820] I had a professor that used to say that the job of the preacher is to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted.
[time=828] And I think it's happened to me all week.
[time=834] So I'm glad, one reason, by the way, this is a sidebar as well.
[time=838] One reason why I believe that what's called expository preaching is important for us to do.
[time=844] All that means, guys, is that we take books of the Bible and work through them.
[time=847] Is there are things that I would talk about there that I would never just think to talk about, otherwise.
[time=854] I'm in the passenger seat and the word of God takes me where it wants to go.
[time=858] We believe in that in this place.
[time=860] We believe it's important for us to work through what God has laid out in his word, exactly as he does it because there are things there that will mess with you.
[time=868] And if you can skip around wherever you want, you just avoid everything that messes with you.
[time=871] Things become very, very comfortable, but not here and not today.
[time=876] Do not love the world, John says.
[time=882] Or he goes farther, the things in the world.
[time=887] That's prohibition.
[time=888] Do not.
[time=891] In fact, the first word in the original language is just no, not, not love, do not love.
[time=899] It's not a suggestion.
[time=901] It's not advice.
[time=903] It's not, if it's convenient for you, it's do not.
[time=907] And that makes people uncomfortable.
[time=910] I understand that.
[time=912] And so we all have a choice to make when you feel that kind of pressure, when you feel that pushing on you, you can say, well, that means something else, obviously.
[time=921] Something I'd like it to mean.
[time=924] To make me more comfortable.
[time=925] Friends, I think we all stand in that place with the word of God.
[time=930] Either we are telling it what to say, or it tells us what to believe, what to do.
[time=937] We all stand in that place in front of it.
[time=940] God's word is living, and it's active, and it messes with you.
[time=945] It always will.
[time=946] Christians are to avoid friends, and I'll have you jot this down.
[time=952] Christians are to avoid an infatuation.
[time=955] That's a big word.
[time=956] An infatuation with worldly godlessness.
[time=959] That's what the world is in first on 215.
[time=962] It is a system that opposes what God is doing.
[time=967] It opposes what God has said.
[time=969] It has no patience for it.
[time=971] And they cannot be friends.
[time=972] Do you see what John said in first on 215?
[time=975] These are mutually exclusive things.
[time=978] Look, do not love the world or the things in the world.
[time=982] If anyone loves the world, the love of the father is not in him.
[time=988] Roman numeral one in your bulletins and the outline is the love of the father.
[time=994] What's the world?
[time=998] The world is a system, again, a system, a mindset, a way that is opposed to what God has said, that is opposed to what God has done.
[time=1009] It's not sort, it's not neutral.
[time=1011] It's hostile to what God has said.
[time=1015] I'm grateful to tell you that he really lays this out in the next verse, in verse 16, all the things in the world, all that is in the world.
[time=1022] So we'll come there in just a minute.
[time=1025] Malcolm Muggerage was a very famous British journalist.
[time=1028] And he said this, "Always in the end, the bargain with the devil has to be fulfilled as any dictator would testify.
[time=1038] I am the light of the world." Jesus said, "Power belongs to darkness.
[time=1043] The world, the world's celebration in effect you guys of itself is dangerous." So John doesn't say if it's convenient for you, how does John address the people to whom he is writing in this letter?
[time=1056] Have you heard that phrase before that Kelly talked about?
[time=1059] He calls them what?
[time=1060] Little children, John is an old man, and I almost picture John here as my grandfather.
[time=1067] So he has very strong, my grandfather had very strong, he didn't care.
[time=1070] My grandpa would stand, would sit in a restaurant, he would hold his coffee cup above his head until someone came around and fill it up again.
[time=1077] 'Cause he didn't care.
[time=1078] Well, my coffee, it's empty.
[time=1080] And if it wasn't the first cup off the top, he'd say, "Let's make a new pot of coffee." And I'm like, "Grandpa, come on, man." He was all, he just didn't care.
[time=1088] And so something, some of that's good, some it's not good.
[time=1092] But what's good about it is this kind of courage and bravery to say what's true and not worry about how it will be received.
[time=1099] So picture John as this grandfather who says, "Son, don't love the world or the things in the world." A picture of the world, as best I can explain it,
[time=1113] is laid out in J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.
[time=1117] If you know the story or not, it is a powerful picture of evil and what evil is capable of.
[time=1124] Evil in Tolkien's books is evil.
[time=1127] It's not this harmless force that you probably should avoid.
[time=1132] It's evil, it's destructive.
[time=1134] It's bent on cruelty and malice and wickedness and it corrupts everything around it.
[time=1139] The beautiful thing about Tolkien's story as to what he does to destroy this evil force, this ring, is a little three and a half foot creature carries it far across the world to have it be destroyed.
[time=1155] The most unlikely person imaginable is to destroy it.
[time=1159] The ring has this corrupting effect and everybody who wears it.
[time=1162] When you put it on, it seduces with its power and the world, friends, is the same way.
[time=1170] It promises things that it can't possibly deliver on and it's not a harmless force that you probably should avoid.
[time=1178] It is a flame.
[time=1179] It's a raging fire that has to be avoided at all costs.
[time=1182] John Calvin said that the human heart is an idol factory.
[time=1187] Look at the very last verse of 1 John, couple of pages.
[time=1194] It's just six words in my translation.
[time=1197] Little children, keep yourselves from idols.
[time=1208] The human heart is an idol factory.
[time=1210] There are many things in this world, friends, that are seductive and that will draw me in and that want me to answer to them and not to him.
[time=1221] And that's the world that John is speaking of in verse 15.
[time=1225] Do not love, don't set your affections on this world to provide for you things in this ultimate way because it can't deliver.
[time=1235] John isn't declaring war on the whole created world and saying everything everywhere is always bad, absolutely.
[time=1241] That's not what he's saying.
[time=1244] God gave us all things richly to enjoy, the Bible says.
[time=1248] And nothing is evil in and of itself.
[time=1250] It can be used that way by our flesh.
[time=1254] The flesh will come up in the next verse.
[time=1256] We can't love everything, though.
[time=1259] You can't love everything.
[time=1263] The love I have for my wife is, by definition, exclusive.
[time=1268] I love her and no one else.
[time=1270] The love of the Father, the love from the Father, the love the Father has for his children.
[time=1277] It's both, actually, in the translation, it could be both.
[time=1281] It's the love of the Father to me.
[time=1284] It's the love I have for him.
[time=1285] It's both.
[time=1286] Love of or from the Father.
[time=1293] There are evil, destructive forces in this world, friends, in its system that have always been and will always be resistant to what God has said and what God is doing.
[time=1304] The love of the Father is exclusive.
[time=1306] Matthew six, Jesus says this, no one can serve few masters.
[time=1310] Either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.
[time=1319] You cannot serve both God and money.
[time=1324] You cannot.
[time=1326] So many times, it's the picture of the sirens.
[time=1333] You had the picture of the sirens from Greek mythology who were singing the song to the sailors.
[time=1340] They're gonna crash on the rocks and they sing their song and the captain of the ship made wax and put it in the ears of all the sailors on the ship so they couldn't hear what the sirens were singing.
[time=1350] He's beautiful voice that would call them in only to crash and be destroyed on the rocks.
[time=1354] And he lashed himself to the mast of the ship so he wouldn't go do something crazy.
[time=1360] You can't serve both.
[time=1365] And the world system is something that John says to be guarded against relentlessly.
[time=1371] Psalm 73, I think this will be on the song.
[time=1378] The screen's behind me.
[time=1379] So go to Psalm 73, if you would, friends.
[time=1382] Psalm 73, starting with verse 21.
[time=1386] I love the honesty of the psalmist.
[time=1391] Psalmist does not cheer code it.
[time=1393] He lays it out.
[time=1393] He tells you exactly how he feels.
[time=1395] He always checks himself, though, against what it is that God has said and what it is that God has done.
[time=1403] He says, "When my soul was embittered in Psalm 73 21, when my soul was embittered when I was pricked in heart, I was brutish and ignorant.
[time=1412] I was like a beast toward you.
[time=1415] Nevertheless, I am continually with you.
[time=1418] You hold my right hand.
[time=1420] You guide me with your counsel and afterward.
[time=1423] You will receive me to glory.
[time=1427] Whom have I in heaven but you?
[time=1431] And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you
[time=1438] my flesh and my heart may fail but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
[time=1445] For behold, those who are far from you shall perish.
[time=1449] You put an end to everyone who is unfaithful to you but for me, it is good to be near God.
[time=1456] I love that line.
[time=1457] I have made the Lord God my refuge that I may tell of all your works.
[time=1464] If you set your affection on the world system, you can't at the same time set your affection on the Father and what he's doing.
[time=1473] Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us that we should be called the children of God.
[time=1481] That is an incredible thing to say.
[time=1486] Verses 12 through 14 were last week and if you would go back to 1 John now, you'll see that what's going on in those verses is terribly exciting.
[time=1497] There's overcoming of the evil one and there's a devotion to the word of God and there is God's word verse 14 abiding in these young men who are strong and I don't think friends I can be excited about that
[time=1515] and about something else at the same time.
[time=1519] Set my affection on those things.
[time=1523] Ever heard the expression that person's so heavenly minded, they're no earthly good.
[time=1526] Ever heard that before?
[time=1528] That's not true.
[time=1529] That can't be true because I have a love toward God and what he's done will direct me out to other people.
[time=1536] It's not love for God cuts me off from people, love for people, love for any other person can cut me off from love for God if it gets out of proper relationship.
[time=1550] But love for God makes me a better husband because I know that what God's word says is true.
[time=1558] Love your wives as Christ loved the church and so I love him.
[time=1563] I press and I want to love my wife and my kids better.
[time=1565] I want to love you better.
[time=1567] Everything seek first God's kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you.
[time=1574] That's a promise.
[time=1575] It's true, but you can't seek one thing first.
[time=1581] Would you write that down?
[time=1582] You can only seek one thing first.
[time=1588] You can't seek four things first.
[time=1590] This one John is talking about.
[time=1594] He has loved us so extravagantly
[time=1600] that any poor attempts we might try to make much of him will be at the most just the start.
[time=1605] I love that hymn over a thousand tongues to sing.
[time=1607] Do you know that one?
[time=1609] You guys know that hymn?
[time=1610] Anybody in the room?
[time=1611] Several of you.
[time=1612] Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing, my great redeemer's praise.
[time=1616] The glories of my God and King.
[time=1618] The triumphs of his grace.
[time=1620] My gracious master and my God, assist me to proclaim, to spread through all the earth abroad, the honors of your name.
[time=1628] Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness
[time=1636] and all these things will be added to you.
[time=1638] What things?
[time=1640] Food, shelter, provision for the day.
[time=1643] That's what he's talking about.
[time=1645] Romans 12, 1 and 2, I think will be on the screens behind me and in front of you.
[time=1653] I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, but the mercies of God to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, wholly unacceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.
[time=1664] Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that by testing, you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.
[time=1678] Living sacrifice, that's an interesting phrase, isn't it?
[time=1682] A living sacrifice.
[time=1684] There is a man in the New Testament whose name is Demas.
[time=1690] And he only stood up in three verses.
[time=1694] And so he get a little bit of his story in three references in three verses.
[time=1698] Demas is first mentioned in Colossians chapter four, verse 14, as a traveling companion of Paul.
[time=1706] In verse 14, it says this, of Colossians four, Luke, the beloved physician, greets you as does Demas.
[time=1714] So Demas is there with Luke, with Paul, a letter's being written, and they're an encouragement to Paul.
[time=1720] He has lots of traveling companions.
[time=1722] He has people with him that make the hard work that he was doing much more doable.
[time=1727] We then see Demas again in the little letter to a Philemon, which is after Titus and before James.
[time=1736] Philemon is a letter written by Paul to a slave owner named Philemon on behalf of a runaway slave named Onissimus, who has left his master and Paul has come to befriend him and Onissimus has come to Christ.
[time=1750] And Paul begs Philemon to receive Onissimus back as a brother, as a brother.
[time=1756] And at the end of this little one chapter letter, he says this in verses 23 and 24.
[time=1763] Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus sends greetings to you, and so do Mark.
[time=1768] The Mark who wrote the Gospel of Mark, probably.
[time=1771] Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
[time=1776] Demas is there with Paul working alongside him as an encouragement.
[time=1784] The last place we see, Demas's name, is probably in Paul's last letter in Second Timothy chapter four and verse 10.
[time=1792] And I wish that his epitaph was a happier one.
[time=1798] This is the last word on Demas.
[time=1803] Paul is in prison looking out on the street beneath the road under a great chained alone.
[time=1814] If you read Second Timothy four, it reads like the last words of a prisoner because that's exactly what it is.
[time=1821] For Demas, in love with this present world,
[time=1827] has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica.
[time=1833] John and Paul understand the seductive
[time=1844] destructive evil power present in the system of the world that will draw people's affections away from Christ and what he's done.
[time=1854] Paul tells this cautionary tale of Demas, very much sort of in the margins, but it's definitely there.
[time=1861] This is in your notes, friends.
[time=1865] It's the takeaway from this first point and it's this.
[time=1868] What you love will be evident to those around you.
[time=1878] You can't fake it and I can't either.
[time=1882] And I think if you asked a few people around you in your life, they could tell you what it is.
[time=1887] People have known you for a long time.
[time=1890] What do you love?
[time=1891] What do you set your affections on?
[time=1895] There is a difference between a barometer and a thermometer.
[time=1899] What's the difference?
[time=1902] A barometer sets the temperature, right?
[time=1906] The monitor just tells you what temperature is.
[time=1908] I think that a barometer in your life is what you love.
[time=1912] It sets your temperature.
[time=1915] What is it?
[time=1916] What tells you how it is you should react to things around you.
[time=1919] It can't be a really long list.
[time=1921] It shouldn't be.
[time=1923] I don't think it is.
[time=1924] What you love will be evident to those around you.
[time=1929] To your kids, to your spouse, your coworkers.
[time=1934] Peter says this in chapter two of his first letter.
[time=1941] And I'll end the first point with this.
[time=1944] Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles.
[time=1949] That's traveling language.
[time=1951] Those who know Christ are passing through this world and they have a greater inheritance on the way.
[time=1957] This is 1 Peter 2 verses 11 and 12.
[time=1960] Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh
[time=1966] which wage war against your soul.
[time=1970] They're not neutral parties.
[time=1972] Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable so that when they speak against you as evil doers,
[time=1980] they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.
[time=1988] Chapter two of first John and verse 16.
[time=1991] I think John in this verse, friends, he explains a little bit more.
[time=1995] What is the world I shouldn't love and why shouldn't I love it?
[time=2000] I'd want to ask those questions if I were you.
[time=2002] What is the world and why shouldn't I love it?
[time=2005] Or anything in it?
[time=2006] What's in it?
[time=2007] Well, verse 16.
[time=2009] For all that is in the world.
[time=2013] I've never been to a gash colon like this.
[time=2017] The desires of the flesh.
[time=2020] The desires of the eyes and pride in possessions.
[time=2027] I met some friends when I got to college about 20 years ago.
[time=2034] I discovered a whole bunch of really good music when I was in college.
[time=2037] A lot of good music.
[time=2038] I think my love for it really was fanned into flame there.
[time=2041] And there was a band called the 77s and they wrote a song called The Lust, The Flesh, The Eyes, and the Pride of Life.
[time=2048] And here are the lyrics to that song.
[time=2050] I think it explains what's going on there in very great detail.
[time=2054] Well, I feel like I have to feel something good all the time.
[time=2059] With most of life, I cannot deal, but a good feeling I can feel, even though it may not be real.
[time=2065] If a person plays her thing, can deliver, I will quiver with delight.
[time=2069] But will it last me for all my life or just one more lonely night?
[time=2074] The lust, the flesh, the eyes, the pride of life drained the life right out of me.
[time=2082] Will I see something?
[time=2085] I want it.
[time=2086] Bam.
[time=2087] Right now.
[time=2088] No questions asked.
[time=2090] Don't worry how much it cost me now or later.
[time=2093] I want it and I want it fast.
[time=2095] I'll go to any length, sacrifice all I already have and all that I might get just to get something more that I don't need.
[time=2103] And Lord, please don't ask me what for?
[time=2106] The lust, the flesh, the eyes, the pride of life drained the life right out of me.
[time=2114] And I love when folks look right at me and what I'm doing or have done and lay it on about how groovy I am and that I'm looking grand.
[time=2125] And every single word makes me think I'll live forever, never knowing.
[time=2131] They probably won't remember what they said tomorrow.
[time=2134] Tomorrow I could be dead.
[time=2136] The lust, the flesh, the eyes, the pride of life drained the life right out of me.
[time=2144] I think that's what John means.
[time=2147] I think that's what he means when he says the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the boastful, maybe your says, the boastful pride of life.
[time=2155] That's what's in the world.
[time=2159] And if I set my eyes on those things, my affections on the lust of the flesh,
[time=2165] I've got to have more and more and more.
[time=2167] I see it in work in my kids' lives in television commercials.
[time=2172] Things that ever even thought they knew existed.
[time=2174] Now they have to have them.
[time=2176] They're late.
[time=2178] That's the lust of the flesh.
[time=2180] It's a craving for physical pleasure.
[time=2182] It won't stop.
[time=2187] I think trying to fulfill the lust of the flesh, you guys, they're trying to take a drink from a funnel.
[time=2192] It has a hole on the bottom of it.
[time=2194] You can do it for a second, but it will not, it can't last.
[time=2198] And so what do you have to do? You've got to get a bigger funnel.
[time=2200] And a bigger one, pretty much all of a sudden it's pouring out the bottom and you have nothing.
[time=2206] That's what it's like for me.
[time=2210] It makes promises, it can't keep the world does this.
[time=2217] The provision of the Father is point number two in your notes.
[time=2222] The provision of the Father stands against the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life.
[time=2229] The provision of the Father.
[time=2233] I know I've read this quote to you before, but I can't help it.
[time=2237] I have to read it again.
[time=2239] See us, Louis.
[time=2242] It would seem that our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak.
[time=2248] We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sacks and ambition when infinite joy is offered us.
[time=2258] Like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies and a slum because he can't imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea.
[time=2269] We are far too easily pleased.
[time=2273] I think that's right.
[time=2276] Our desires, when they're, I don't fix my eyes on Jesus and my desires, they leave him and they head down here, lead me to disaster.
[time=2287] And they will lead you to disaster too.
[time=2292] So here's the takeaway from point two, the provision of the Father.
[time=2299] What he has provided is all satisfying.
[time=2309] At his right hand, Psalm 16 says, "At his right hand are pleasures forevermore."
[time=2316] God is not against pleasure.
[time=2318] God is not against enjoyment.
[time=2320] God is not against the things that oftentimes we celebrate with other people.
[time=2329] He is not against those things.
[time=2331] He's against counterfeit things that take the place of real things.
[time=2336] God is on the side of pleasure which is good and perpetuates itself.
[time=2342] What he has provided is all satisfying.
[time=2344] C.S. Lewis said this about prosperity.
[time=2346] I think he's right.
[time=2351] Prosperity nits a man to the world.
[time=2355] He feels that he's finding his place in it when really it's finding its place in him.
[time=2362] God isn't against pleasure.
[time=2365] How could he be again?
[time=2366] Everything was good when he made it.
[time=2369] God loves to provide for his children.
[time=2373] And as a loving Father, he wants to keep you from things that are not good for you.
[time=2379] So see it as that.
[time=2380] Don't see God's prohibitions in his word are not things he's some kind of cosmic killjoy.
[time=2387] You like that?
[time=2388] Stop it.
[time=2389] You like that?
[time=2390] Stop it.
[time=2391] It's against things that can't give you what they promise.
[time=2396] If you can see it that way, friends, I think it would be a tremendous encouragement to you.
[time=2399] Romans 13 says this.
[time=2402] Romans 13 verses 11 through 14.
[time=2407] Besides this, you know the time that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep.
[time=2413] For salvation is near to us now than when we first believed.
[time=2417] If we are gone, the day is at hand, let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.
[time=2424] Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies or drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in corolling and jealousy.
[time=2434] But put on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2437] That's the provision of the Father, Jesus.
[time=2442] And make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires.
[time=2446] It is insatiable, friends.
[time=2450] You cannot.
[time=2451] It is impossible to gratify its desires.
[time=2456] It's bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
[time=2459] It's like trying to scrub out a stain and the scrubbing that you're doing is making it worse and worse and worse.
[time=2467] The third point this morning together is from verse 17, and it's the will of the Father.
[time=2477] Verse 17 says this.
[time=2480] The world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.
[time=2492] So what is God interested in in a life that you're shuffling your feet around that I can't do this and I can't do that.
[time=2499] God does them, says no, nothing, nothing.
[time=2502] He wants forever abiding.
[time=2505] He wants forever ab- that's his provision for you is forever abiding.
[time=2510] That's not a consolation prize.
[time=2514] I'll repeat myself.
[time=2516] I really want to do this lust of the flesh and the eyes and the pride of life, but God says he gives me forever abiding.
[time=2520] Oh, okay.
[time=2523] It's infinitely better.
[time=2526] I don't mean to be trite.
[time=2527] It's infinitely better.
[time=2530] Augustine wrote in a sermon, "Hold fast to Christ.
[time=2536] For you he became human that you might partake of eternity."
[time=2543] It's a good trade, guys, to leave this world behind and press on toward what he has.
[time=2549] It's a good trade.
[time=2551] It's a beautiful exchange.
[time=2554] I know it seems like it's too risky.
[time=2560] When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die.
[time=2563] I know it's risky.
[time=2565] And we should not like it isn't because it is.
[time=2571] So here's your notes for point three.
[time=2573] Here's something I'll give you by way of a takeaway.
[time=2577] It's this.
[time=2579] Plug into what he's doing.
[time=2582] Plug into what he's doing and participate in eternity.
[time=2588] That's better.
[time=2596] See us, Lewis, that if you aim at earth and you miss heaven, you lose both.
[time=2600] If you aim at heaven, you get earth thrown in.
[time=2606] Don't set up shop at the circus.
[time=2611] The circus comes through town and it leaves.
[time=2614] So building a permanent thing next to the circus is not a good idea.
[time=2620] That's what John's telling you to do.
[time=2622] Don't set up shop at the circus.
[time=2624] The circus is leaving town.
[time=2626] It's going to blow in.
[time=2628] And there's peanut sauce left behind.
[time=2630] That's pretty much it.
[time=2633] Don't set up shop at the circus.
[time=2636] Don't throw your anchor into waters that you should not throw it in.
[time=2645] 1 Corinthians 7, verse 29.
[time=2650] The best interpreter of the Bible is the Bible, so that seems appropriate to me.
[time=2655] 1 Corinthians 7, verse 29 says this.
[time=2657] This is what I mean, brothers and sisters.
[time=2661] The appointed time has grown very short.
[time=2664] From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none.
[time=2669] And those who mourn as though they were not mourning.
[time=2671] And those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing.
[time=2675] And those who buy as though they had no goods.
[time=2677] And those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with the world, but the present form of this world is passing away.
[time=2683] What's Paul's point?
[time=2684] That can be a fairly confusing passage.
[time=2686] I think he means this.
[time=2688] I think he means if you place all your chips in that basket, in your marriage, in your
[time=2697] sadness, in your rejoicing, in your stuff, then you've missed it.
[time=2704] So buy stuff like you're not buying stuff.
[time=2706] Buy it because you can.
[time=2707] That's it.
[time=2708] It's fine.
[time=2709] It's a TV.
[time=2710] It's nice.
[time=2711] Big deal.
[time=2712] It's my 65 inch HD TV.
[time=2715] Wow.
[time=2716] You know, football season's coming.
[time=2718] You know, no.
[time=2721] Yes, but no, right?
[time=2726] Buy it like you're not buying it.
[time=2728] That's not who you are.
[time=2729] That's what you have.
[time=2732] Do you see?
[time=2734] It's not who you are.
[time=2736] It's what you have.
[time=2738] It's different.
[time=2741] Two more passages as the band makes their way back up on the stage.
[time=2746] 1 Peter 1, having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth, for a sincere brotherly
[time=2752] love loved one another earnestly from a pure heart.
[time=2756] Since you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God, all flushes like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass, the grass withers, the flower falls.
[time=2771] The word of the Lord remains forever.
[time=2774] And this word is the good news that was preached to you.
[time=2778] In 1 Peter 4, he says this, "The end of all things is at hand, therefore be self-controlled
[time=2786] and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers, above all, keep loving one another earnestly
[time=2792] since love covers a multitude of sins.
[time=2795] Show hospitality to one another without grumbling.
[time=2798] As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another as good stewards of God's varied
[time=2804] grace, whoever speaks as one who speaks oracles of God, whoever serves as one who serves by
[time=2814] the strength that God supplies.
[time=2819] In order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to him be gone glory
[time=2828] and dominion forever and ever." And everybody said, "Amen, God thank you for your word, Lord, love for you, love from
[time=2843] you, your provision, your will, God, we don't want to miss it.
[time=2850] And we are so prone to, I am.
[time=2854] The world is shiny, it's a shiny place, God.
[time=2859] If there's anybody in this room who has set their love on the world and they got burned,
[time=2870] God, I pray that you would give them your encouragement today and that you would buy
[time=2877] your spirit, impress upon them the importance of finding encouragement in the body of Christ.
[time=2884] If I can be an encouragement to them, God, bring them down front to talk to me afterwards.
[time=2890] Thank you for the chance to sing again in response to what you've said and what you've done.
[time=2896] God, would you help us?
[time=2900] It's easy to love the world.
[time=2901] It's really easy for me.
[time=2903] It's hard to love you.
[time=2907] Give us your strength, Father, to do it, to do it well, proud of these things in Jesus's name.
[time=2910] [AMEN] [MUSIC - 610 seconds]
