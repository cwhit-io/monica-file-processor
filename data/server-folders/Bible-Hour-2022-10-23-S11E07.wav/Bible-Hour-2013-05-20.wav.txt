[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, good morning and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] It's great to be able to spend these few minutes with each and every one of you.
[time=37] And it's been a while since I've said to each and every one of you this, we would really love to have you come and join us on a Sunday morning.
[time=45] Every once in a while, I just reach out to those of you in the viewing audience.
[time=50] I know there are thousands of you who watch all the time.
[time=54] And every once in a while, I just want you to hear me say that while I understand some of you have home churches and that's a good thing.
[time=62] And while I understand some of you really can't get out and about and this is your church experience and we're really thankful for that.
[time=69] There are those of you who could.
[time=72] You really could get up, you could get dressed and be here at nine or 1045.
[time=76] I mean, come on, 1045's a pretty easy deal.
[time=79] And you could be here and I want you to know we would love to have you here.
[time=84] I know that the broadcast is a blessing to you.
[time=87] I know you enjoy and appreciate the chance to connect with us in this way.
[time=90] But I'm telling you every Sunday morning I walk into this building and experience what God is doing in and through this family.
[time=98] Every Sunday morning I get to experience our worship gathering.
[time=101] Every Sunday morning I get to experience this family as they come together and worship and praise and to study the word of God.
[time=109] Every Sunday morning, I think to myself, boy, there are so many people who would be so encouraged and so helped and so moved along in their spiritual journey if they could be here in the room.
[time=122] And so I'm inviting you this morning, whoever you are.
[time=126] And you know who you are.
[time=127] God's maybe been tugging at your heart, kind of pulling at your spirit.
[time=131] Come and be with us.
[time=132] Come check it out.
[time=133] Come for a couple, two or three weeks and see what it's like to be here in the room with us.
[time=137] We would love to meet you.
[time=139] We'd love to encourage you.
[time=140] I'd love to pray with you down front afterwards.
[time=143] I'd love to hear about what God's doing in your life.
[time=145] And so come on us Sunday morning, nine or 1045.
[time=149] We'd love to have you here.
[time=150] We're studying first, John.
[time=152] It's helping us understand in a very real and practical way what it looks like, what it is like to be a follower of God's son.
[time=160] And we'd love for you to be in the room with us.
[time=163] God bless you.
[time=164] Great to connect with you here.
[time=166] Thank you so much for being a part of our broadcast family.
[time=169] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=172] [MUSIC - 145 seconds]
[time=319] (audience applauding)
[time=328] - What a great prayer, huh?
[time=335] A great way to start our time together.
[time=338] Just remembering that the kingdom of heaven isn't hand.
[time=341] It is near, it is possible in this place.
[time=345] In our hearts, in this city, in our nation.
[time=349] But the way the kingdom of heaven comes near is Christ, dwells within his people.
[time=354] When they believe on the sacrifice of Jesus, they're dwelled in by the spirit.
[time=361] And when the spirit dwells in people, things begin to happen and change.
[time=367] Would you stand together, church?
[time=368] And let's remind ourselves that we need Christ to answer the prayers we just sing.
[time=374] [MUSIC - 213 seconds]
[time=594] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 20 seconds]
[time=624] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 251 seconds]
[time=881] - So good to see each and every one of you
[time=894] here this morning.
[time=895] So glad to be back in our study of the book of 1 John, this incredible epistle, this letter from John himself.
[time=904] John is, as you remember, if you were here back to the beginning of our study, John's about 95 years old.
[time=912] That's pretty old.
[time=913] John's been around for a while.
[time=915] John is, as I mentioned to you earlier, the last man standing.
[time=920] He is the last of the disciples.
[time=924] He is the last guy on earth who walked with, sat with, spent time with, lived with, did ministry with Jesus Christ.
[time=934] And John in this precious faith of his, that he obviously cares deeply about.
[time=940] He has been used by God to birth this faith and to birth the church and the ministry of the New Testament age.
[time=948] John's concerned about false teaching, false teachers.
[time=951] There is this philosophy known as Gnosticism.
[time=954] It has started to make its way into the church.
[time=957] People are starting to scatter.
[time=959] People are starting to believe things that they shouldn't.
[time=963] The gospel, the true message of Christ is being attacked.
[time=967] And so John at 95 sits down and writes one of the most practical, one of the most direct, one of the most powerful treatments of New Testament faith ever written.
[time=980] We see in this letter the fact that he goes to great links to make sure that they know and to make sure that you know exactly what it means.
[time=991] When you raise your hand and you say you're in, when you raise your hand and say I want to fully surrender my heart and life to follow after the Son of God, John says now wait a minute, that's gotten awfully fuzzy, lately.
[time=1007] Those waters have been muddied and I want to make sure that you the church know exactly what that means.
[time=1014] And the way he does it is he gives the reader then and he gives the reader now, tests.
[time=1021] He structures the book and the writing of the book.
[time=1024] I've told you this before.
[time=1025] He provides you and I with these tests.
[time=1028] We get to test the veracity, the genuineness of our faith.
[time=1032] And he gives us two kinds of tests.
[time=1034] Do you remember what they are?
[time=1035] First he gives us tests of doctrine.
[time=1037] As you read through first John, you're going to come across sections that deal with what you believe or what you as a believer, you as a follower of Christ should believe.
[time=1046] Tests of doctrine.
[time=1048] Then there are also tests, moral tests.
[time=1051] Tests, in other words, how are you going to live out what you believe?
[time=1055] Does your doctrine translate into everyday living tests?
[time=1061] And so as we've made our way section by section, chapter by chapter, this is what we've had the privilege of looking at these tests of true genuine saving faith.
[time=1071] This morning, we come back to a test of doctrine.
[time=1075] Back to a very important test of doctrine.
[time=1078] Last week, Steve Webster did a phenomenal job, giving us a chance to look at a test of morals.
[time=1085] Talked about first John, chapter 2, verses 15, 16, 17,
[time=1091] not loving the world or the ways of the world.
[time=1095] And now we come this morning to verse 18 and a doctrinal test.
[time=1101] In other words, as a true genuine believer, as a legit follower of Christ, you will, John says, you will need to believe what's about to be written.
[time=1111] You will need to hold on to what John is about to say.
[time=1115] This doctrine, this truth that you're about to see is something that you need to own and hold on to, if in fact you're truly in.
[time=1125] So here we go.
[time=1126] Would you, in honor of God's word, stand and allow me to read to you this morning, first John, chapter 2, verses 18 to 22, John says to the church, he's at Ephesus at this time.
[time=1137] He sees all of this transpiring and he speaks now at a doctrinal level, children, it is the last hour.
[time=1147] And just as you heard that anti-Christ is coming, even now, many anti-Christs have appeared.
[time=1153] From this, we know that it is the last hour.
[time=1156] They went out from us, but they were not really of us, you see, for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us, but they went out so that it would be shown that they all are not of us.
[time=1172] But you, you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.
[time=1178] I've not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie is of the truth, who is the liar, but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ, this is the anti-Christ, the one who denies the Father
[time=1198] and the Son.
[time=1200] Our Father in heaven, we stand before you this morning, a thankful people, thankful for your word and thankful for the great lengths to which you've gone, here in first John, to give us a clear and unambiguous treatment of true saving faith.
[time=1219] God, it's the most important thing in the world.
[time=1223] It's the most important thing we could ever understand.
[time=1225] It's the most important thing we could ever be clear on.
[time=1228] It's the most important thing that our hearts could embrace.
[time=1233] And so God give us great wisdom this morning, and God give us great clarity as we look at it again.
[time=1239] And may those in the room this morning who truly are yours, those who know you and those who have surrendered their hearts and lives to you, may this be an exercise, God that would lead to gratification and great thankfulness.
[time=1254] Oh God, for those in the room still on a spiritual journey, for those in the room, God's still asking questions.
[time=1260] I pray that today their questions would be answered, not so much by me, but by the great truth of the scriptures and by the person and work of your son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=1272] God, we're grateful for the morning, and we pray, God, that as we give ourselves to this, that you would be honored and the truth would be lifted up.
[time=1280] And all the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=1284] Amen, you can have a seat.
[time=1285] Last week, watch how this works.
[time=1287] Last week, Steve Webster from first John chapter 2, verses 15 through 17, basically, communicated and proclaimed a powerful message.
[time=1296] Don't love the world.
[time=1299] John said that the church then, Steve, reminded us last week, don't love the world.
[time=1304] Don't have affection for the world.
[time=1307] Don't have devotion to the world, the world's system, the world's values, the world's thinking, the world's philosophy.
[time=1315] It was really clear, don't love the world.
[time=1318] The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life.
[time=1324] Instead, no, the message of first John was love God.
[time=1328] Don't love the world, love God, love what's true, love what's right, love what's good.
[time=1334] Love God in all that comes with God, for God in all that comes with Him, we saw last week is eternal.
[time=1343] But the world is what?
[time=1345] Say it, church, if you remember, passing away.
[time=1348] The world is finite, the world is limited.
[time=1353] The world's gonna end, the philosophy and the values of the world.
[time=1357] The world and all of its lusts, scripture said last week is fading.
[time=1361] And isn't it interesting that last week ends with the world is passing away and we pick up in verse 18 this morning, children, it is the last hour.
[time=1376] Children, it is the last hour.
[time=1383] What do you think that means?
[time=1385] Just would love for you to think about it just for a moment this morning.
[time=1387] What do you think that means?
[time=1388] When you hear me say that, when you see it there in your text in your first John chapter 2, 18, when you hear John saying to them and you hear me articulating to you this morning that John says it is the last hour.
[time=1402] What comes to your mind?
[time=1405] This is the last hour.
[time=1407] These are the last days.
[time=1410] This is the end times.
[time=1413] Boy, it's something that has sparked a great deal of conversation.
[time=1418] It is something that has sparked a great deal of debate.
[time=1420] It is something that books have been written about for years and years and years, movies and series and all kinds of discussions.
[time=1428] There's whole idea of the last hour and the last days and the end times.
[time=1435] What do you think it means?
[time=1437] How would you articulate the importance of this?
[time=1440] Let's do what we always do here.
[time=1442] Let's go to the Word of God and take a look and see what it actually means and what it's actually referring to when John says children, it is the last hour.
[time=1451] Get your Bibles out.
[time=1452] And let me hear the pages turning.
[time=1454] Go to Hebrews chapter one, would you?
[time=1457] Everybody, go to Hebrews chapter one.
[time=1460] Look on with someone nearby.
[time=1462] If you don't have a Bible yourself, I want you to see this.
[time=1465] Hebrews chapter one verse two.
[time=1467] It says in verse one, God after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets, in many portions and in many ways.
[time=1476] So long ago, God spoke through the prophets.
[time=1479] Says in verse two in these, what?
[time=1482] Say it, church.
[time=1483] In these last days, okay, wait a minute.
[time=1486] In these last days, He has spoken to us in His Son whom He appointed heir of all things through whom also He made the world.
[time=1498] So here we have the last days being connected with this idea of the Son of God speaking.
[time=1506] In these last days has spoken to us in His Son.
[time=1510] Look at first Peter.
[time=1512] Go to first Peter chapter one, verse 20.
[time=1517] It says,
[time=1523] 18 says, knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, but with precious blood as of a lamb, unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ, for He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but has appeared in these last times, these last days, these last hours for the sake of you.
[time=1553] So we have the last hour associated with Christ speaking.
[time=1558] We have the last days associated with Christ simply appearing.
[time=1563] If you go to Acts chapter two, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John,
[time=1569] go back to Acts.
[time=1571] Peter here embarking on what is truly the great sermon of all time.
[time=1576] He says in Acts chapter two,
[time=1583] let me get there, right there, 17.
[time=1585] And it shall be, in 15, He's describing to the crowds the faithful disciples and followers of Christ who now because of the pouring out of the Holy Spirit were able to communicate with people in the city there during the Passover, they're able to speak in their language.
[time=1608] And so they're speaking in languages because the Holy Spirit has come and the folks thought they were drunk and he says, no, they're not drunk for these men are not drunk as you suppose, verse 15, for it is only the third hour of the day but this is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel and it shall be in the last days.
[time=1629] God says that I will pour forth of my spirit on all mankind.
[time=1635] So here in Acts two, last days are clearly associated with the birth of the church, the pouring out of the spirit.
[time=1644] Here we see New Testament doctrine unlike the Old Testament here.
[time=1648] Now we come to a point where the spirit of God is given at the point of salvation.
[time=1654] And so you have the last days, the last times, end times, all being associated with these different things.
[time=1661] Let me just make it really clear for you, okay?
[time=1663] We get a little hung up on this thing because we tend to, in our Western minds, we tend to think of, we get hung up on the word last and we think of last as a end point in time.
[time=1678] We think last days and we think four seconds left in the game.
[time=1687] We think four seconds left in the fourth quarter and the truth is, and it's important that we understand this that the last hour, last times, according to the scriptures, according to the scriptures we just read and others I could take you to, is not a point in time.
[time=1705] The last days is not a fixed place in time but instead represents a span of time.
[time=1711] The last hour is a span of time.
[time=1715] You see, the last days are the days between the first coming of Christ, his appearance, we just saw it.
[time=1722] The last days is the span of time between the first coming of Christ and the second coming of Christ.
[time=1730] It's between the nativity and his coronation.
[time=1733] It is the era of redemptive history, the timeframe, here you go, the timeframe within which Christ will complete his church.
[time=1743] You get that, right?
[time=1748] You know, don't you, that that's how this will work.
[time=1752] That between Bethlehem, his birth and the second coming,
[time=1758] in that span of time Christ is going to complete the church.
[time=1766] What do we mean by that?
[time=1767] What we mean by that is this, it's a really amazing thought.
[time=1770] Everybody who's going to be in, everybody who's going to fully surrender their heart and life to Christ, everybody in the world who is in God's design and sovereign plan, going to come to faith is going to come to faith between his birth and his second coming.
[time=1791] And when that occurs, whenever that's done and who knows when that's done,
[time=1802] do you, do I, did Jesus?
[time=1805] No, only God knows.
[time=1807] Whenever that's done, the last days will come to an end.
[time=1812] When that happens, the last hour will be over.
[time=1817] Christ will return.
[time=1820] Matthew 24, the sun loses its strength.
[time=1827] The moon loses its light.
[time=1829] The stars start falling from the sky and when that happens, all heaven.
[time=1835] It's going to break loose.
[time=1837] It's really going to happen.
[time=1840] When?
[time=1843] I don't know.
[time=1845] And see, here's the deal.
[time=1847] Last days isn't an important time.
[time=1849] Last days is a span of time.
[time=1851] You see the truth of the matter is there could be four seconds left.
[time=1853] There might be eight minutes left in the first quarter.
[time=1857] I don't know.
[time=1859] But these are the last days.
[time=1861] Here's my encouragement to you on this point.
[time=1863] Stop wondering if these are the end times.
[time=1866] I can't tell you how many times I get asked.
[time=1868] Do you think these are the end times?
[time=1870] Let's stop asking that question.
[time=1872] Let's stop wondering if this is the last hour.
[time=1875] Here, I'll just answer it for you.
[time=1877] It is.
[time=1879] And it has been since the day he was what?
[time=1883] Born.
[time=1883] Since the day Messiah came, since the date of his birth, it has been the last hour.
[time=1891] These are the last days.
[time=1893] This is the end times.
[time=1895] Let's not worry or wonder so much about that.
[time=1898] Here's an encouragement for you.
[time=1900] Instead, care more about, be more interested in bringing an end to this last hour, bringing an end to these last days.
[time=1908] You say, how can I do that?
[time=1910] Help God complete the church.
[time=1913] This is what this whole thing's predicated upon.
[time=1918] The whole thing's predicated upon the church being completed, and so you and I get this privilege.
[time=1924] He didn't need us.
[time=1925] He didn't have to do it this way, but he says to you, and he says to me, help me bring people to a saving knowledge and understanding of my son.
[time=1935] And I would much rather you and I spend our time.
[time=1941] I would much rather you and I give ourselves to helping him complete the church than anything else in the world.
[time=1951] Don't know when it's gonna happen.
[time=1952] I just know that between Bethlehem and the Second Coming, he's gonna complete the church, and he wants you and I to be intricately a part of that endeavor.
[time=1965] And so I wonder how you look at your friends.
[time=1967] I wonder how you look at your days.
[time=1969] I wonder how you look at your place in this world, in this sphere of influence that he has placed you in.
[time=1977] See, it is why we're here.
[time=1980] You and I begin to think oftentimes that we're here for a number of other reasons.
[time=1984] No, no, back up a minute, get some perspective, take a deep breath.
[time=1989] This is why we're here.
[time=1990] We're here to help him complete the church, and it should be one of the great endeavors of your everyday life and mine.
[time=1999] There is in the passage this morning another indicator.
[time=2004] Watch this, that these are the last days.
[time=2007] It's found right there in verse 18 as well.
[time=2011] Let me read this till you go back if you would.
[time=2014] It's the first John chapter two, verse 18, children, it is the last hour.
[time=2018] And just as you heard, he goes on, that anti-Christ is coming.
[time=2023] Even now, many anti-Christs have appeared.
[time=2028] From this we know, from the appearance of many anti-Christs, we know that it is the last hour.
[time=2038] Now, the verse does initially refer to the anti-Christ.
[time=2042] Raise your hand this morning if you've ever heard discussion about the anti-Christ.
[time=2047] Let me see, yeah, most people have heard about, most people have talked about, most people have read about this idea of the anti-Christ.
[time=2055] This is, let me say to you this morning, this is, I believe, a real individual whose scripture says will as a final world ruler energized by Satan, seek to both replace and oppose the true rule of Christ while bringing great persecution and pain to the church.
[time=2076] Now, this final world ruler energized by Satan won't start out as an enemy of the church.
[time=2084] No, he will be respected by, he will be looked to, he will appear as if he's in.
[time=2091] But as that unfolds, he will definitely not be in this anti-Christ, this final world ruler.
[time=2101] And you start talking about that and I picked it up again the last couple of weeks, I start reading the passage.
[time=2108] One of my first thoughts and one of your first thoughts this morning is, oh, we're gonna talk about the anti-Christ.
[time=2114] Let's hear more about this anti-Christ 'cause we're so caught up in the idea of what he does and who he is and who he's gonna be and you think he's so-and-so and you think it might be him.
[time=2126] And the fact is, it's like the second coming, you don't have a clue, we won't until it happens.
[time=2133] But watch what John does, John quickly moves us away from discussion of or thinking about the anti-Christ because what does he say?
[time=2143] He says, and just as you heard that anti-Christ is coming even now, many anti-Christs have appeared.
[time=2151] He goes plural on us.
[time=2157] He takes the discussion away from this guy, whoever he is and he makes sure the reader knows that there's a lot of him right here, right now.
[time=2168] And they're all anti-Christ.
[time=2173] Says in verse 19, "They went out from us, "but they were not really of us these anti-Christs, "for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us, "but they didn't, they went out "so that it would be shown that they all are not of us.
[time=2192] "But you," he says, "you haven't left.
[time=2196] "You're sitting tight and he says to you," he says, "you haven't anointing from the Holy One.
[time=2203] "And you all know, I'm not written to you "because you do not know the truth, "but because you do know it.
[time=2210] "And because no lie is of the truth.
[time=2212] "Who is the liar but the one who denies?" Here you go, this is anti-Christ.
[time=2217] This is capital A, anti-Christ.
[time=2220] This is small anti-Christ.
[time=2223] This is all he wants you to understand right here.
[time=2226] He says, "Who is the liar but the one who denies?
[time=2229] "That Jesus is the Christ." This is the anti-Christ, the one who denies the Father and the Son.
[time=2238] And what I want you to catch this morning is that while the individual anti-Christ or the persons making up the plural anti-Christs are important, what John's getting at is more important and that is the message of these individuals.
[time=2257] Remember why he's writing the letter?
[time=2260] I told you 10 minutes ago.
[time=2262] This is what John's getting at.
[time=2264] John's not getting at who's it gonna be.
[time=2267] He's not even really getting at who are they.
[time=2271] He's getting at the message that they communicate and it's destructive potential for those in the church.
[time=2278] He's writing because of false teachers.
[time=2280] Remember there was a false message.
[time=2282] They were denying the divinity, the power, the message of Christ these gnostics were.
[time=2288] And I want you to see this this morning.
[time=2290] I want you to understand this in the context of our day.
[time=2294] The great trait of the last days is an increasing mindset that is anti-Christ.
[time=2302] The great trait, you know you're in the last days when the mindset that you hear and the attitude that you bump into and the way of thinking that you again and again come up against is anti-Jesus, anti-truth, anti-principals and accountability.
[time=2322] It's anti-scripture and it seeks to pull you away from your king.
[time=2328] It seeks to pull you away from your allegiance.
[time=2331] It seeks to pull you away from the one you love.
[time=2335] Does that sound familiar?
[time=2341] Well, you don't really need me to stand here and tell you that we're living in the last hour.
[time=2348] If the last hour is defined by that which is anti-Jesus and anti-truth, then all you have to do and all I have to do is sit down at 6.30 and watch the news.
[time=2359] All you and I have to do is sit down on any given day and read the paper.
[time=2363] And just like in Ephesus with John and the Gentiles,
[time=2369] we see in our day, those who once looked like they were in, leaving, they're walking away, you see it, I see it.
[time=2379] It's one of the great heartbreaks of my life.
[time=2383] I mean that.
[time=2383] One of the great heartbreaks of a life in the seat I've gotten to sit in with the view I've gotten to have is I've seen those who for five years or for 10 years or for 15 years or for 20 years.
[time=2396] It looked as if they were in.
[time=2398] It looked as if they knew what they were talking about.
[time=2401] They raised their hand.
[time=2403] They professed Christ.
[time=2405] They ordered their life in a certain way.
[time=2407] It really, for all intents and purposes, appeared as if what you had here with somebody genuine, but time goes by.
[time=2414] And again, it could be five.
[time=2415] It could be 10.
[time=2417] It could be 20 and all of a sudden boom, they're gone.
[time=2420] They choose a different gospel.
[time=2428] It's something they think is good news.
[time=2431] They restructure their allegiance.
[time=2434] They go a different direction with their devotion.
[time=2439] They begin to believe a different message.
[time=2444] There are those who develop an allegiance to way more than a man.
[time=2451] It's way more than anti-Christ.
[time=2453] It's an allegiance to the world.
[time=2455] It's exactly what it is.
[time=2457] It's an allegiance to that which is anti-Christ.
[time=2462] And I just want to ask you this morning.
[time=2464] I've asked you this before.
[time=2465] I bet I'll probably ask it to you again, but this morning's a good time for me to ask you.
[time=2470] Who are you more loyal to, really?
[time=2473] Where's your allegiance this morning?
[time=2477] Who are what are you following?
[time=2479] I mean, really following.
[time=2481] You say, oh, how do I know who I'm following?
[time=2483] How do I know who I'm loyal to?
[time=2484] How do I really dig down to the reality of my allegiance?
[time=2489] Here you go.
[time=2490] How do you spend your time?
[time=2491] How do you structure your time?
[time=2493] What choices do you make with your time?
[time=2495] If I followed you around or you followed me around, if I had a view into the everyday of your life and I got to see what your focus is, what would your focus, the stuff that you think most about, the stuff that you plan most toward, the things that you talk about?
[time=2513] If I looked at the way you spend your time, if I looked at the way you focused your attention and your energies, if I looked at the way you used your talent, God's given you talent, God's given you gifts, God's given you abilities in certain areas, do you use those talents and do you use those gifts for who?
[time=2530] See, if we wanna know allegiance, if I really wanna know who you are following, we ask these kinds of questions, your time, your focus, your talent, your passions.
[time=2540] Believe me, I get excited about things.
[time=2542] You get excited about things.
[time=2543] There's stuff that stirs us deep in our heart.
[time=2546] What is it that stirs you?
[time=2548] Whatever it is that stirs you is what you begin to focus on.
[time=2551] It's what you begin to schedule your time for.
[time=2553] It's what you use your gifts toward.
[time=2555] And where's your treasure going?
[time=2557] Jesus was right where our treasure is, there our heart will be as well.
[time=2564] What are you investing in?
[time=2566] See, here's the truth of the matter, the world, the world wants your time, the world wants your focus, the world wants your gifts, the world wants your money, the world wants your passions.
[time=2577] And Steve told you last week, it's an empty deal.
[time=2582] It's all passing away.
[time=2584] God's saying, no, love me.
[time=2586] Be loyal to having allegiance to me.
[time=2591] Steve wrote this for me.
[time=2595] Pastor Steve, as I like to call him these days, sometimes it sounds better than Webby, I know.
[time=2602] But Webby and I are talking about the great connection between 1 John chapter two, 15 through 17.
[time=2610] Don't love the world or the things in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life.
[time=2616] The world is passing away with all of its lust, but he who does the will of God abides forever.
[time=2621] And then we come to 18.
[time=2623] These are the last hours.
[time=2625] And antichrists are everywhere.
[time=2629] But not you, he says.
[time=2631] So Steve and I are talking about this and he writes this for me.
[time=2634] The ruined, depraved system of this world will always have champions with loud voices.
[time=2642] These voices, antichrists, have been are and will be interested in promoting that which is contrary to what God has said and what God is doing.
[time=2655] These voices, the world and its desires are passing away.
[time=2659] Those that do the will of God will abide forever and will reveal themselves to be true servants of the Holy One, true sons of God through their righteous conduct.
[time=2671] And the sad heart-breaking reality is, yes, they're walking away.
[time=2678] And in walking away, they show themselves who have never really been in in the first place.
[time=2687] And John says to the church at Ephesus, and I say lovingly and with great gratitude in my heart for many of you, he says to them, but not you.
[time=2698] But not you.
[time=2700] You see it there in the text.
[time=2702] But you have an anointing.
[time=2705] The Spirit of God was instilled in you at the point that you were redeemed.
[time=2711] You have an anointing from the Holy One and you know.
[time=2714] I'm not written to you because you don't know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie is of the truth.
[time=2720] Look at 23, whoever denies the son does not have the father.
[time=2724] The one who confesses the son has the father.
[time=2728] As for you, let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning.
[time=2732] I'll leave you with this.
[time=2737] People are always wanting to know.
[time=2739] People have asked me, never could quite figure out why they asked me.
[time=2742] I think it's just because of what I do.
[time=2743] They think somehow I might have some kind of insight.
[time=2746] I really don't.
[time=2746] People ask me all the time, do you think so and so is saved?
[time=2750] Do you think she really knows the Lord?
[time=2755] Or do you think he's really in?
[time=2758] People will ask these things of me and you sometimes have these conversations with others.
[time=2762] We're trying to kind of figure out each other's spiritual realities.
[time=2766] And while I understand that there are things that you can witness, there are things that you can see in me today at 50.
[time=2773] There's things I could see in you at 30.
[time=2776] Yes, there are things along the way that give me a great sense or a growing sense of confidence about you or me.
[time=2783] Watch this, you know what the truth is after 26 years of ministry, after the privilege of being able to study this book after reading first John again and again and again, even in recent weeks.
[time=2796] Here's how I've learned to answer that question.
[time=2799] You want to know if someone's saved?
[time=2802] I often say to people this, you know what?
[time=2804] We'll just wait and see.
[time=2808] Because they're either gonna stay or they're gonna go.
[time=2816] And if they go, they will never really end.
[time=2822] But if they're in and they're really in, they're gonna stay.
[time=2829] It's just the way that works.
[time=2832] And I want to encourage you this morning again, if you have confidence, if you have gratitude, if you have thankfulness that you're in, that you have surrendered your heart and life to follow after the ways of Jesus.
[time=2843] Be grateful for that and continue to lift up the great truth of the Son of God.
[time=2850] If you're not sure, if you're on this journey, this morning it begins to get clearer and clearer for you, that the stakes are actually very high.
[time=2860] I pray to God and I hope that you'll come.
[time=2862] Hope you'll come today when we dismiss and I hope you'll give us a chance to talk with you about what it means to really know, to have the confidence and the assurance of salvation.
[time=2872] There is a great old doctrine of the faith.
[time=2875] It's called the Perseverance of the Saints.
[time=2878] And it's the belief that those who are truly saved will always be saved.
[time=2883] That those who truly come to faith in Christ have in that faith, that genuine faith, the ability and the power and the strength to persevere.
[time=2895] And this is exactly what John's talking about here.
[time=2898] And I'm so thankful for so many of you in this room who have persevered in your faith.
[time=2903] You show yourself not only to be faithful, but you show yourself to be saved.
[time=2909] And for that I'm very grateful.
[time=2911] Corbin's gonna come and lead us in communion.
[time=2913] Will you bow your heads with me this morning?
[time=2915] Our Father in heaven, we're grateful for your word and what a privilege to be able to come to the table.
[time=2920] The table that represents the sacrifice of the very son we've been talking about this morning.
[time=2925] This precious and great salvation that he has granted and made possible of God today, we get to remember this.
[time=2933] We get to remember the fact that blood was spilled.
[time=2935] We get to remember the fact the sacrifice of his body was made so that our sins could be forgiven so that heaven and eternity could be solidified in the lives of your church.
[time=2947] Oh God, thank you.
[time=2949] Thank you for what you did, the kind of love that you showed.
[time=2953] May we return that love.
[time=2954] May we not love the world.
[time=2957] May we love you.
[time=2959] And may we realize that in the face of, in the midst of anti-Christ's everywhere,
[time=2967] may we hold fast to that which we know to be true.
[time=2971] And in our holding fast, God give us great encouragement.
[time=2976] We pray in your son's name.
[time=2978] [AMEN] (gentle music) In 1 Corinthians 11, Paul writes,
[time=2991] so then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.
[time=3001] Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup.
[time=3008] For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves.
[time=3015] And it's in those verses that we learn how important it is to repent and remember before we do this exercise.
[time=3025] We're gonna sing a few songs in the next few minutes and give you the chance to pray, repent and remember.
[time=3034] And also come to a table close by to get the cup and the bread.
[time=3037] And then after we're done with this time, we'll eat together and drink together.
[time=3042] So I'll give you the chance to do that now.
[time=3045] (gentle music)
[time=3055] [MUSIC - 93 seconds]
[time=3163] (upbeat guitar music) [MUSIC - 225 seconds]
[time=3417] (gentle piano music) - Before I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you, the Lord Jesus on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you.
[time=3434] "Do this in remembrance of me." In the same way, after supper, he took the cup,
[time=3446] saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[time=3450] "Do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me." For whenever you eat this bread or drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[time=3460] And Lord, we thank you for the chance
[time=3469] to proclaim this amazing mystery that instead of hating us when we were your enemies, you loved us instead.
[time=3479] And you loved us so much that you gave your one and only son to be beaten and embarrassed and killed to carve a path for us to take,
[time=3497] to become not your enemies anymore but your friends.
[time=3501] Thanks for your kindness and your forgiveness and your mercy that you displayed on our behalf and the cross.
[time=3508] God, would you help us to live these last days well?
[time=3517] Would you help us to persevere to the end and keep the faith and be a people who make a difference in every day that you give us to live?
[time=3528] May it please you and may it be so in the powerful name of your risen son, Jesus.
[time=3535] [AMEN]
