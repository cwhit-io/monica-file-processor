[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, good morning and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=33] It's great to have you with us.
[time=35] I'm thankful for these few minutes and I'm so grateful for what God has been teaching us and showing us in our study of first John.
[time=42] That's right, it's an amazing epistle.
[time=43] This letter that John writes, John, at the time of the writing is about 95 years old.
[time=48] He's the last disciple standing.
[time=51] He's the last one living of all the people on the face of the earth at that time.
[time=56] He's the one who had walked with Jesus, who had talked with Jesus, who did ministry with Jesus, who was himself, discipled and loved and cared for by Jesus himself.
[time=68] And so he has this huge burden to write and communicate the foundations, the basics, the truth about faith in Christ already at that time.
[time=80] Much like what we see in our time today in that time, there were those who wanted to water down the truth.
[time=88] There were those who were trying to kind of deviate from the central message of the gospel.
[time=94] And John writes to give a foundation to the believers, the early believers in that day.
[time=99] And he writes to give you and I a foundation as well.
[time=103] Today we're gonna talk about the love of God at the core of the gospel message and at the basic level of our faith is this great concept of this great truth of the love of God.
[time=116] The love of God, it reminds me of hymns that we used to sing as a little boy sitting right next to my mom in church.
[time=125] The love of God is something that many of us have thought about or sort of known about.
[time=132] We've maybe believed it for all these years.
[time=137] And yet it is a practical, real, everyday truth that is at the core of our faith.
[time=143] And so I invite you to listen today with your heart wide open.
[time=148] You, whoever you are, however old you are, however young you are, whether you're red, yellow, black or white, professional, educated, uneducated, factory worker, mom, dad, student, doesn't matter, every one of you is looking for, hoping for, longing for a love that God designed you to experience.
[time=171] And I hope as you listen today, you'll begin to connect the dots on where it is and with whom it is that you're to experience that love.
[time=180] I'm so thankful for you.
[time=181] We would, at Black Hawk, love the opportunity to get to know you better.
[time=185] I hope someday soon, some Sunday morning you'll come and visit with us and let us get to know you.
[time=191] I hope today's message will encourage you.
[time=193] Thank you so much for tuning in.
[time=195] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=197] God bless you, have a great week.

[time=363] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 11 seconds]
[time=381] (upbeat music) (audience applauding) - Let's bow our heads together.
[time=390] Heavenly Father, we are so thankful Lord to be in your house today, Lord, and we're so expectant to hear your word today, and Father, we pray for our pastor, Kelly, today that you would strengthen him and speak through him and anoint his words, Lord, open our ears to hear what he has for us, Lord, bless Kelly and his family with health and prosperity and Father, have your way in his words today and in this place.
[time=427] We ask all this in the name of Jesus, and all the people said, "Hey, man." - Thank you, John.
[time=436] - Most of you may be recognized, or even know, John, Jonathan, Leakedy, John has been, John and Connie, have been a part of our family here at Blackhawk for five, six years, and all of us who have been around for those five or six years were pretty clear on the fact that John could sing.
[time=453] It speaks to his character that a lot of us didn't really know that John could lead worship, that John could put his arms around an entire morning and give leadership and guidance to it.
[time=464] He just came for five, six years and just served and just did what he was asked to do.
[time=469] And now in this time of transition with Corbin and Tonya headed toward Poland and other worship leaders in our family beginning to step forward, all of whom were extremely supportive of and grateful for.
[time=482] It's great to have John in that mix.
[time=485] He's a full-time guy out at a little place called Partview and so he's a little busy.
[time=491] And yet we're going to get to experience and enjoy his involvement in our worship periodically and for that.
[time=499] I am so thankful and so grateful.
[time=501] How about you?
[time=502] Thank you to God for bringing John and Connie along.
[time=507] First John, chapter three.
[time=510] My friends, open your Bibles if you would.
[time=512] First John, chapter three.
[time=513] And as you open your Bibles to that place, let me just ask you a question.
[time=517] Imagine if you can this morning, and I'll just give you a chance to get those minds in gear.
[time=522] I want you to be imaginative in your thinking.
[time=526] I'm asking you to begin right now to paint a picture, if you will.
[time=531] Picture this morning in your own mind.
[time=534] What would it look like if you were just going to paint a picture or develop a picture of love?
[time=542] What does love?
[time=544] Real love, what does for you, what would that look like?
[time=550] If we were just going to develop a picture of love, you're going to just put it up on the screen.
[time=555] And from your perspective, from your vantage point, if you were really trying to get at the meaning of love, what would that picture entail?
[time=565] What would that picture of love look like?
[time=568] Would it be a boy and his dog?
[time=571] And all that comes with that picture.
[time=574] You see that picture, you see that boy, you see that dog, you know there's more to it than that.
[time=579] And I wonder if that kind of begins to hit on this picture of love that might develop in your mind.
[time=585] Is it a group of teenage girls who are close and tight and together
[time=591] and they are buddies and they laugh and they have overnights and they tell secrets that are never, ever, ever broken from the most part?
[time=603] Is it a boy and his dog?
[time=605] Is it teenage girls?
[time=607] Is it, this is where a lot of us kind of default to, I think, is it a young couple in love?
[time=611] Is this the picture?
[time=613] Is this the ultimate picture of love?
[time=616] They are excited about each other.
[time=619] They are thrilled about the possibilities of their future.
[time=623] They are growing in not only their attraction to each other, but they are knowing of each other and they have got the whole world and future ahead of them and they heart each other.
[time=638] Is this the picture of love?
[time=641] Or maybe it's an older couple still in love.
[time=647] Maybe that's a powerful picture of love.
[time=652] Maybe they hearted each other 50 years ago, but the truth of the matter is they still are loving each other, standing by each other.
[time=662] They have endured hard times.
[time=664] They have faced difficulty with a great, great picture.
[time=668] Maybe this is a picture of love that comes to your mind.
[time=672] You know, maybe it's a father.
[time=677] Maybe it's a father with his child.
[time=681] Maybe it's a mother and her kids.
[time=685] This is truly a powerful reality.
[time=689] A powerful picture.
[time=692] I've read recently again about them for, I think, 20 years, Dick and Ricky Hoyt.
[time=699] Years and years and years, literally thousands and thousands of miles.
[time=703] Dick has pushed Ricky in his specially designed cart in triathlons and marathons together facing challenges and father and son.
[time=715] It's a powerful, powerful picture.
[time=718] Maybe it's an adoptive child.
[time=720] What a strong biblical picture we have of adoption.
[time=725] What a hugely profound thing it is when you start to think about the dynamics of a child being picked, a child being chosen, words we'll come back to later.
[time=738] I love all the pictures that we've seen on the screen already, but those last ones, this relationship between a father and a child, a mother and a child, this parental love, if you will, it's really special.
[time=751] It really is.
[time=752] In God's design, there is no greater love, no love more powerful, no love more enduring than the love of a father, a parent.
[time=762] And while your love for your children or my love for my own children may be strong and deeply felt, your fatherly love and mine are also deeply flawed.
[time=775] While the love of God, our Heavenly Father is not.
[time=781] His love isn't flawed.
[time=783] And to be a child of God, as we will see this morning, to be a son or a daughter of the living God, and if you're looking for a main point this morning, here it is.
[time=794] If you're looking for something to kind of hang the rest of these 25 minutes on, here it is.
[time=799] If you're looking for kind of the central truth of what 1 John 3, 1 and 2 is about to teach you, here it is.
[time=807] Oh, to be a son or daughter of the living God is to be loved in the most intimate, the most meaningful, and the most powerful way possible.
[time=821] To be a son or a daughter of the living God.
[time=827] And in 1 John 3, this love of God is described in a number of different ways, three in particular, and I want to make sure you see and take note of each of them this morning out of honor and respect to the word of God would you stand and let me read this to you first, John 3, verses 1 and 2.
[time=848] It says there in verse 1, see John writing to the church at Ephesus.
[time=853] John the Apostle, the last man standing who knew and walked with and did ministry with Jesus Christ, wanting to make sure that in a sea of compromise and cultural struggles in terms of the gospel, he's wanting to make sure the church understands the foundations of this faith.
[time=874] And so he continues verse after verse section, after section.
[time=877] Now we come to this in chapter 3, fundamental truth that we must hang on to.
[time=884] See how great a love.
[time=888] The Father has bestowed on us.
[time=892] He says that we would be called children of God, and such we are.
[time=897] For this reason the world does not know us because it did not know him, beloved.
[time=902] Now we are children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be.
[time=908] We know that when he appears we will be like him because we will see him just as he is.
[time=917] And everyone who has this hope fixed on him purifies himself just as he is pure.
[time=924] Pray with me.
[time=925] Father in heaven, we stand before you this morning again anticipating and hoping and asking you to do that which only you can do in us.
[time=936] God, all that we are, the circumstances of life that we face, the patterns and habits that we are in the midst of the realities of our life, this weekend, even this morning, all of it God we bring, and we lay before you and we say, oh God, let us teach us and please grow us and please move us in a new direction.
[time=959] Wherever there needs to be change, God bring it.
[time=962] Wherever there needs to be conviction, God we pray you would grant it.
[time=966] God, I pray that young and old in the room this morning, all of us alike, part of the family of God would hear these words and be grateful.
[time=976] And God, for those in the room this morning that quite frankly love, in the family of God they stand here this morning with us, we are so grateful for them, we are so appreciative of the fact that they continue with us in their journey trying to better understand what it means to fully surrender their hearts and their lives to following after your son, God as they hear again this morning the truth, the truth of your word and as they hear and see your heart.
[time=1006] God, we pray for them.
[time=1008] We pray, God, that you would continue to bring them to yourself, opening their hearts and their eyes to the life changing, eternity altering truth that can save them.
[time=1020] God, we pray your blessing on all of us in this room.
[time=1024] Help us this morning, we pray in your son's name.
[time=1027] [AMEN - 1 seconds] You can be seated.
[time=1030] First John, chapter three, first couple of verses.
[time=1032] We are going to see this morning, my friends, that God's love is great.
[time=1036] We are going to see that God's love is great.
[time=1038] Secondly we are going to see that God's love came first and thirdly we will see that God's love is parental.
[time=1044] It is, God's love is parental by its very nature which makes you and me if we know him that makes us children of God.
[time=1053] Let's begin with God's love being great.
[time=1056] Hope you will write that down.
[time=1057] God's love is great.
[time=1058] I am not sure you know this but on your own, on your own in your own human realm.
[time=1065] I am not sure if you know this but on your own, take him out of it for a moment.
[time=1071] In your own human experience, in your own human relationships, in your own human realities, I am not sure if you know this but you have never experienced great love.
[time=1085] You never have.
[time=1087] You have never experienced this kind of great love.
[time=1094] No matter how good it is or was with your parents, no matter how good it is or was with a spouse, best friends or a special sibling, the love you have experienced at any human level has been less than.
[time=1111] It really has been.
[time=1112] It has been less than what God designed for you.
[time=1118] It has been, say it this way, it has been less than divine.
[time=1124] And that doesn't make any of them spouse, friend, sibling, parent, doesn't make any of them bad or evil.
[time=1131] It just means they're not God.
[time=1136] And oh, how I want for you this morning to experience and to
[time=1143] know and to feel and to live in the love of God.
[time=1150] And I want to just invite you if you would to take your Bibles.
[time=1153] Let's take the word of God this morning.
[time=1155] Would you just follow me through a few passages that will allow you, it will allow each and every one of us this morning to take a real honest and clear look into what this love of God, this great love of God looks like.
[time=1167] As we make our way through, you'll be able to just kind of come up with your own outline of different characteristics of this great love of God.
[time=1176] Would you join me just a page or two over?
[time=1178] Would you go to 1 John chapter 4 verse 9?
[time=1182] Our first stop in our look at this great love of God.
[time=1187] It says in 1 John 4 9, by this, you see it?
[time=1193] By this, the love of God was made manifested.
[time=1202] So stop right there just so you understand what that saying is that the whole love of God was manifested.
[time=1210] It got taken from this realm of theory.
[time=1215] It got taken from this realm of truth and it got put right on the table of human everyday practical reality existence.
[time=1227] By this, what's this?
[time=1229] Well, he's about to say it, the love of God got made really, really clear to you.
[time=1238] What is it that made it so clear that God has sent His only
[time=1244] begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him?
[time=1252] He doesn't send His only begotten Son.
[time=1255] You don't live, you what?
[time=1257] Say it, Church, you die.
[time=1259] But He doesn't want you to die because He loves you.
[time=1262] He loves you deeply and He loves you so deeply that His only begotten, this special, unique, one-of-a-kind, never-to-be experienced-again Son of His gets sacrificed, given for you.
[time=1275] This is how the love of God, the great love of God, is made manifest.
[time=1282] It gets put right there in the open for us to see an experience because He really did give His Son for you.
[time=1290] He loved you that much.
[time=1292] Go back, if you would.
[time=1294] Go back to Romans.
[time=1295] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.
[time=1297] There's the Gospels for those of you still figuring this out.
[time=1299] We're thankful you're trying.
[time=1301] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, then comes Romans.
[time=1305] Go to Romans 5.
[time=1308] And I want to start at verse 3.
[time=1311] What a great picture this is of the love of God.
[time=1315] We see it made manifest in 1 John 4 by the giving of His Son.
[time=1319] Now look at this.
[time=1320] Look what the great love of God does here.
[time=1323] And not only this, Romans 5, 3.
[time=1327] But we also exalt in our tribulations.
[time=1330] Stop right there.
[time=1331] Did you know that?
[time=1332] I think most of you do.
[time=1333] For others of you, let's just make sure you catch up.
[time=1335] In the life that we've been given, following Jesus Christ.
[time=1339] In this life of faith, we are, the Bible says, to exalt.
[time=1344] We're to be okay with.
[time=1346] We're to be thankful for.
[time=1348] There is to be a deep sense of being really okay with tribulation
[time=1354] because look what tribulation produces.
[time=1356] Look at the cycle spiritually that kicks in once tribulation, which a loving God allows.
[time=1364] Look what happens.
[time=1366] We exalt in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance.
[time=1372] And perseverance brings about proven character.
[time=1376] And proven character brings about hope.
[time=1379] And hope does not disappoint.
[time=1382] No, hope carries us through.
[time=1384] Hope comes with a promise.
[time=1386] Hope actually works.
[time=1388] Why?
[time=1389] Because the stay out loud church, the love of God has been poured out
[time=1395] within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
[time=1401] The whole crux of the matter when it comes to hope, when it comes to you hanging on to a future that you believe God has for you.
[time=1409] When it comes to hope and this ability to somehow persevere and endure and keep moving forward through whatever difficulty or challenge you might be facing.
[time=1420] The word of God teaches us today that that hope is made possible because the love of God has been poured out in your hearts.
[time=1428] And you know it.
[time=1429] And you know he loves you.
[time=1431] And you know he gave his son for you, 1 John 4-9.
[time=1434] And he pours out this love in your heart when you come into relationship with him and having poured out all of his great love in your heart now when you face whatever it is you face.
[time=1448] Whatever it is you're facing, even right now, the love of God
[time=1455] has been poured out in your heart and hope can do its thing
[time=1461] because you know he loves you.
[time=1464] He gave his son for you, he pours out love in his heart for you so that hope can endure.
[time=1470] Go just a couple of verses down.
[time=1472] Look at Romans 5-8.
[time=1475] But God demonstrates his own love.
[time=1477] Here's the great love of God showing up again.
[time=1480] But God demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet what?
[time=1484] Say it.
[time=1485] Sinners.
[time=1486] Christ died for us.
[time=1488] While we were yet sinners.
[time=1491] Let's just for a moment because sometimes we read that sort of quickly.
[time=1496] Sometimes we can kind of just, yeah, I've heard that.
[time=1498] But wait, stop.
[time=1499] Pause just for a moment.
[time=1501] He demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were
[time=1507] yet sinners we were hateful, we were antagonistic, we were
[time=1520] disobedient, we were disrespectful, we were ungodly, we were
[time=1527] rebellious.
[time=1528] I'm not overstating it.
[time=1531] This is a sinner.
[time=1535] And it's just silly to even compare, but just for the sake of comparison, think about it.
[time=1540] Think about your love, human love versus his love.
[time=1544] Think about how much you would be willing to give someone who was antagonistic and rebellious and disrespectful and obedient, disobedient and against you.
[time=1560] And while we were all of that, he gives his son and he pours out his love in our heart because his love is like something you've never experienced.
[time=1572] His love is divine.
[time=1575] And then you go back to Romans 8, you just go a few pages over.
[time=1580] And here you see what this great love of God is made of.
[time=1585] Here you see what constitutes the great love of God.
[time=1590] Here you see it's metal.
[time=1592] Here you see it's foundation.
[time=1594] Look at what it says in 35 who will separate us from the love of Christ.
[time=1600] Paul talks about tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword.
[time=1610] And he says, but in all these things, 37 we overwhelmingly conquer through him who what loved us.
[time=1618] And here it is, for I am verse 38, for I am convinced that neither death nor life, angels nor principalities, things present nor things to come nor powers nor heights nor depths nor any other created thing will be able to separate us ever from the
[time=1638] what?
[time=1639] Say it, Church, love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[time=1644] So not only do we see it made manifest through the offering of his son, not only do we see him pouring out his great love into our hearts so that hope can reign.
[time=1657] Not only do we see it offered to those who were enemies and
[time=1663] antagonists and disobedience, but now we come to find out that
[time=1669] once you've experienced it, once you've bowed the knee of your heart and surrendered yourself to him.
[time=1677] Once you're his, there isn't anything unlike the love that you
[time=1683] and I have experienced in the human realm, there isn't anything that will listen, that will ever, like for a moment.
[time=1694] We were talking about this in the car last night.
[time=1698] Never, ever for a moment, not one second, not one instant.
[time=1705] Are you ever separated?
[time=1708] You are in him loved completely always and there's nothing you
[time=1716] can do and there's nothing that can happen and there's nowhere you can go where you're separated from this great love.
[time=1727] I've seen a lifetime of wreckage and heartache and sorrow,
[time=1736] carnage from people in all my years of getting to do what I get to
[time=1744] do as we try to come alongside to help and encourage I have seen a lifetime of heartache and sorrow from those who have never known God's love, never known God's love, never known God's
[time=1764] great love and why does, why does not knowing his love brings
[time=1771] that heartache and sorrow because God I've told you this before I'm going to tell you again real quick because God made you, God designed your little theology lesson for you real quick here, real quick here, God made you, He created you.
[time=1786] He designed me to live fully and completely connected to His
[time=1793] great love if we're talking about you and me and we're talking about us experiencing love.
[time=1801] He designed us to experience that from him.
[time=1808] You want love?
[time=1810] And guys, I hope you're hanging with me.
[time=1812] Guys, you see love and love and love and songs about love.
[time=1821] You think this little fluffy, it's not fluffy.
[time=1824] Guys, this is really real.
[time=1826] It's really important that we all understand this.
[time=1828] You want love?
[time=1829] I know you do.
[time=1831] He designed you to want it and to need it.
[time=1835] And He made you to get your love from Him.
[time=1838] But sin came and just messed all that up.
[time=1850] And so you're still trying to drag it out of your spouse.
[time=1858] You are.
[time=1859] You're still trying to get it out of your spouse.
[time=1862] You are still trying to demand that your spouse love you and touch you at the deepest level.
[time=1870] A level your spouse was never designed by God to touch.
[time=1873] Because you were designed by God to have Him touch you at that level.
[time=1880] Or you're still bitter.
[time=1881] You're 42 years old and you're still bitter at your mom and dad because they didn't provide it for you the way you think they should have.
[time=1888] And whether they did or they didn't isn't the issue.
[time=1891] The issue is you're wanting something from them.
[time=1893] God never made them to give.
[time=1896] Because He made you to get that from Him.
[time=1901] Or you're sleeping around.
[time=1904] You're living a life of moral compromise.
[time=1908] Just hoping some night it might show up finally.
[time=1914] And it won't.
[time=1916] It never will. Because nothing human ever will meet your need for love at that level.
[time=1924] Because only God's love is great.
[time=1928] Amen?
[time=1930] It's just the way it is.
[time=1932] This great love that you were designed to have can only be met by Him.
[time=1937] And so I hope this morning that you would open your heart and your mind and your eyes to the reality that you may very well be missing out on the greatest love you've ever known.
[time=1949] Because you're looking in the wrong place toward the wrong person in the wrong ways.
[time=1955] His love is great.
[time=1957] Here's the second thing I want you to understand about God's love.
[time=1962] It came first.
[time=1967] He loved before you did.
[time=1971] I want you to look at the text and go back to 1 John 3.
[time=1975] And it says right there at the beginning.
[time=1977] See how great a love.
[time=1979] We just talked about that.
[time=1980] See how great a love the Father has bestowed.
[time=1983] In the NASB it says He has bestowed this love on you.
[time=1987] And we focus in on this word bestowed which carries with it a clear picture of initiative.
[time=1994] This love that He lavishes.
[time=1996] This love that He bestowed.
[time=1999] The text tells us there is that this was His idea.
[time=2002] This was His doing.
[time=2004] He prompted this.
[time=2005] He started this.
[time=2007] He initiates this.
[time=2008] He loved you way before you ever conceived of the notion.
[time=2016] Ephesians.
[time=2017] Ephesians 1, go back in your New Testament.
[time=2021] Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians.
[time=2025] It's right there between Galatians and Philippians.
[time=2027] Go to Ephesians 1.
[time=2028] Would you?
[time=2030] Look what it says in Ephesians 1, 4, and 5.
[time=2036] And let me just say this to you.
[time=2038] We could have and we can have and we do have at times.
[time=2041] Very interesting theological discussions about Ephesians 1.
[time=2046] I'm really good with that.
[time=2047] I want to invite you this morning to read this without the enormous theological implications of predestination and foreknowledge.
[time=2057] It's all there and we can talk about that.
[time=2059] I want you to read this with a kickball game in mind in fourth grade on the playground.
[time=2065] All right?
[time=2067] Some of you know what I mean.
[time=2070] Listen, it says in Ephesians 1, 4, just as He chose us.
[time=2077] In Him, before the foundation of the world, He chose us.
[time=2084] That we would be holy and blameless before Him in love.
[time=2089] There is that great love of God popping up in eternity past.
[time=2094] He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to
[time=2100] Himself according to the what?
[time=2102] According to the kindness, the kind intention of His will.
[time=2108] And then if you go back to 1 John 4, do that real quick.
[time=2112] Go back to where we started 1 John 4, 19.
[time=2115] Oh, this is so brief and so short, but it just says it all.
[time=2120] 1 John 4, 19, we love.
[time=2123] Raise your hand this morning.
[time=2125] Honestly, raise your hand if with your best effort, with your best of intentions, raise your hand.
[time=2131] If the truth is, you really do love God.
[time=2133] You have a love in you for God.
[time=2136] Yeah, great.
[time=2137] It says there, just understand this.
[time=2139] We love because He first loved us.
[time=2148] It's why women always want the guy to make the, what?
[time=2155] Say it, ladies, first move.
[time=2159] Well, I kind of dated myself there.
[time=2161] I realized today, I realized today gals can make the first move.
[time=2166] We'll talk about that next time.
[time=2170] Back in the day, we'll be nostalgic.
[time=2173] How's that?
[time=2174] The gals always wanted the guy to make the what?
[time=2177] Say it again.
[time=2179] First move.
[time=2181] Why?
[time=2184] Why, ladies?
[time=2188] You don't have a microphone, so I'll answer for you.
[time=2191] Because it means so much when you get pursued.
[time=2199] When he cares enough to make a call, or he is interested enough
[time=2206] to actually want to be with you, when he, because of whatever's
[time=2212] going on in his heart, feels like, seems like you mean enough to him where he wants to initiate something.
[time=2220] It just brings the sense of being, say it, being loved.
[time=2227] There's nothing like being chosen.
[time=2230] I'm not a woman, but I was in fourth grade, and I was out at
[time=2236] recess, and I've told you before, I'll tell you again.
[time=2239] In fourth grade, at five foot six, my head was this big and I had
[time=2245] these ears, and I weighed 56 pounds, and I was brutalized.
[time=2251] They killed me every day.
[time=2253] I just got leveled verbally, just abused, and I never got picked.
[time=2259] Ever.
[time=2261] I never got picked.
[time=2263] And I didn't just not get picked.
[time=2265] I got verbally abused, and I told first hour, you know what?
[time=2269] You might think it's weird.
[time=2270] Maybe you never lived in my shoes.
[time=2272] I'll tell you what, at 20 years of age, when I came to faith in Christ that night in September, when I bowed the knee of my heart, I literally thought about it.
[time=2281] I thought, at age 20, how good it felt to be picked, to be chosen,
[time=2292] and to feel that sense of value and worth.
[time=2296] All friends understand, God picked you.
[time=2301] This God of great love, He came after you, and that makes you special, that makes you desirable, that makes you valuable, and there are people in this room.
[time=2311] Some of you don't need to be reminded of that, but there are a number of you in this room this morning, and you desperately need to be reminded of that, so let me just remind you of that again.
[time=2323] He picked you, and He came after you, and that makes you special, that makes you valuable, that makes you desirable.
[time=2334] You see, you're worth, oh, please don't miss this.
[time=2337] You're worth, you're value, your beauty isn't defined by anyone in your abusive past.
[time=2344] I know they messed with some things, but they can't mess with that.
[time=2348] He loves you, and He sees you as valuable and desirable and
[time=2355] beautiful.
[time=2356] You being desirable is in no way connected to your physical appearance, or how many dates you've had, how many friends or followers you have on Facebook or Twitter, your worth, your value, you being desirable is only connected to the fact that God sacrificed His only Son.
[time=2375] He turned His back on His only begotten, because God wanted to be with you.
[time=2384] How's that for love?
[time=2388] It's the truth.
[time=2393] He loved you first, before the foundations of the world.
[time=2398] He picked you.
[time=2401] Third thing this morning.
[time=2406] Third thing I want you to see is love is great.
[time=2412] Then thirdly we see here that His love is fatherly.
[time=2417] His love is paternal.
[time=2419] I hope you'll write that down.
[time=2421] His love is great.
[time=2422] His love came first, and His love is paternal.
[time=2425] It's fatherly, which makes, if you know Him, if you've fully surrendered your heart and life to Him, it makes you His child.
[time=2433] And I just want to make sure we say it.
[time=2435] I want to make sure that you see it, and not just see it.
[time=2437] I want you to begin to, again, this morning we're talking about imagining things in pictures and paintings, and I want you to feel this.
[time=2444] I want you to really stop just for a moment, if you will, and understand you're a child of God, if you know Him.
[time=2456] You're not His partner.
[time=2458] You're not His dude.
[time=2460] You're not His homeboy.
[time=2463] You're not His guy.
[time=2467] You're His son.
[time=2469] You're His daughter.
[time=2471] This is verbiage that's important because being a son or a daughter
[time=2477] brings unbelievable implication.
[time=2482] Think about it just for a moment as we close.
[time=2484] Children are, what are, it says in verse two, just again so you can see the emphasis He makes.
[time=2492] He says that we would be called children of God in verse one.
[time=2495] Then verse two, He says, "Beloved, now we are children of God.
[time=2499] We are." And I want to just ask you this morning, are you living those of you who have bowed the knee of your heart and fully surrendered your heart and life to following after the ways of His son?
[time=2512] Are you living as a child of God?
[time=2516] Are you?
[time=2517] Well, you say, well, what does a child of God live like?
[time=2521] Well, think about how a child lives.
[time=2524] Will you?
[time=2525] Just think about how a child lives.
[time=2528] Children are under authority.
[time=2533] Let's, for the sake of the conversation, let's think ten-year-old.
[time=2539] Let's think kids.
[time=2540] This is the closest picture we have here to this work.
[time=2543] Let's think children.
[time=2545] Let's think ten-year-old.
[time=2547] It was amazing yesterday.
[time=2550] My eleven-year-old and her buddy, Evie and Emma, decided to do a lemonade
[time=2557] stand and they baked cookies.
[time=2560] And they wanted to set up shop out on the end of our driveway.
[time=2565] And I just, I helped them a little bit and they got all the stuff.
[time=2569] And Emma's folks pitched in and we got all the, all the stuff needed.
[time=2573] And they look at me and say, okay, like, what should we do?
[time=2581] And so it just struck me as the day went on, you know, into the driveway wasn't a good call.
[time=2587] Because they're flying by at thirty-five, forty miles an hour.
[time=2590] Let's go down the road a ways, to the entrance, to the addition down there and set up shop on the sidewalk.
[time=2596] And they're like, ah, it's a great idea.
[time=2599] And we, what side of the street should we set it up on?
[time=2602] And should we hold the signs or should we tape the signs?
[time=2605] And what should we say to people?
[time=2607] And I'm just telling them what to do and I'm just telling them how to go.
[time=2611] And I'm just, and everything I say, they just say, okay.
[time=2616] Isn't that nice when they say that?
[time=2619] Okay.
[time=2621] Whatever you say.
[time=2623] I mean, if you say it, you're dead.
[time=2628] I'll do it.
[time=2631] See, that's a child.
[time=2634] They're under authority.
[time=2637] And he's father.
[time=2639] And they just, they do it.
[time=2641] And that's the picture God gives for you.
[time=2644] As a child of God, are you living under authority?
[time=2647] Is your response to him on all fronts?
[time=2650] Okay.
[time=2651] I'll do it.
[time=2653] Because your dad, your father.
[time=2657] And I'm me and you're you and how in the world we ever get them coming under us is beyond me.
[time=2663] Because you're so flawed and so am I, but he's not flawed.
[time=2667] His love is great.
[time=2669] Children are under authority.
[time=2670] Children are provided for.
[time=2672] Think about that.
[time=2673] Think of his provision for you.
[time=2675] Think of the way he has graciously, day after day, week after week, month after month, he has brought to your life the things that you need.
[time=2686] Children are, children are loyal.
[time=2690] Children are so loyal.
[time=2695] I've seen this in my own experience.
[time=2697] Maybe many of you have as well.
[time=2699] I've seen children in messed up situations.
[time=2706] Stuff you don't even want to think about.
[time=2709] Stuff it's even hard to even talk about.
[time=2713] She's being done and stuff being perpetrated and I've seen eight, nine, ten-year-old kids exercise this loyalty.
[time=2723] It's just mind-boggling, but it's there because he is there.
[time=2727] What?
[time=2728] Dad.
[time=2729] Because she's their mom and they're just loyal.
[time=2735] I think about my kids.
[time=2737] I think about the unspeakable flaws that exist in my life.
[time=2743] Things I'd never want any of you to see or even know about.
[time=2747] And I think about the way they've journeyed with me as I keep trying to be who God's called me to be and I keep failing.
[time=2756] And I think about the loyalty.
[time=2758] I think about the hugs I get.
[time=2759] I think about the encouraging words that keep coming.
[time=2762] It's unbelievable how loyal a child is and I pray and I hope to God that your loyalty to him.
[time=2769] And again, he's not me.
[time=2771] He's not you.
[time=2772] He's perfect.
[time=2774] All that you would be loyal and faithful to this God who has loved you greatly.
[time=2784] Father, I pray this morning as we stand and begin to worship you in response to this truth.
[time=2790] I pray, God, that you would be lifted up.
[time=2793] I pray that our hearts would be softened.
[time=2795] I pray that we would love in the ways that you have loved us.
[time=2799] God, be with us as we worship you here in these closing moments we pray in your son's name.
[time=2805] [AMEN]
[time=2815] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.
[time=2823] Amazing light, now flowing down from hands and feet.
[time=2835] There were nails to the tree, as grace flows down and covers me.
[time=2846] Amazing grace, sweet the sound.
[time=2857] Amazing light, now flowing down from hands and feet.
[time=2869] There were nails to the tree, as grace flows down and covers me.
[time=2880] He covers me.
[time=2916] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.
[time=2924] Amazing light, now flowing down from hands and feet.
[time=2935] There were nails to the tree, as grace flows down and covers me.
[time=2946] He covers me.
[time=3041] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.
[time=3203] When I cannot stand, I'll fall on you.
[time=3211] Jesus, you're my hope instead.
[time=3217] When I cannot stand, I'll fall on you.
[time=3224] Jesus, you're my hope instead.
[time=3233] Lord, I need You.
[time=3241] Every hour I need You.
[time=3247] My one defense, my righteousness.
[time=3254] Oh God, how I need You.
[time=3261] Lord, I need You.
[time=3273] Every hour I need You.
[time=3280] My one defense, my righteousness.
[time=3288] Oh God, how I need You.
[time=3296] My one defense, my righteousness.
[time=3305] Oh God, how I need You.
[time=3318] Maybe in just a declaration of honesty and transparency before him and he already knows it's true because he sees your heart.
[time=3328] Could you just say that out loud again?
[time=3330] Maybe you could just say it with me.
[time=3332] Oh God, I need You.
[time=3338] Say it.
[time=3342] Do You?
[time=3344] I do. And there are some in the room this morning and you need Him desperately to stay faithful in your movement toward following His Son, amen.
[time=3355] You need Him, don't you?
[time=3358] And there are others of you in the room, though, and you maybe need Him today for the first time.
[time=3362] Maybe today you're realizing, "Oh God, I need You.
[time=3366] I need Your gospel.
[time=3367] I need Your good news.
[time=3369] I finally met this place where I need to experience Your great love."
[time=3375] And I want to just ask all of you if you would to bow your heads and close your eyes and if that's you this morning and you're watching live stream or that's you this morning and you're here in this room, I want to just let you know that you can
[time=3386] and really in your own words, you can from your own spirit, just say to God something like this, "Oh dear Father in Heaven."
[time=3398] I understand today more than ever that my sin has separated me from relationship with you.
[time=3409] And God, I know and I see clearly today that you, because you love me, gave your Son to die, to forgive me of my sin, to defeat death and to give me a hope for all of eternity.
[time=3427] And God, I just want to declare to you today my gratitude and my commitment to follow you, to draw a line in the sand and put a stake in the ground and say from this day forward, I will follow you.
[time=3449] I love you, God, tell them that, I love you, God, and thank you for first loving me.
[time=3462] Our Father in Heaven, we know that if in fact there are those who articulate from their own hearts and their own words, that kind of sentiment today, that kind of a confession that they were just in that moment redeemed,
[time=3476] and they've become children of God and others of us in the room, God, we move forward from this service as children of God, and we pray for your help as we want to do that well, we want to be faithful in that.
[time=3491] And so God, thank you for the glimpse this morning you've given us of your love.
[time=3496] Thank you for the encouragement that it offers.
[time=3500] And as we prayed earlier this morning, I'll pray it again as we go, God, I pray that we would live as people who have been loved.
[time=3509] I pray that we would live as people who have experienced that which you designed us to have, and overflowing, unending, constant presence of your kind and gracious love.
[time=3524] May we reflect that as we leave this place today and bring us back together again, if that be your will, we pray in your son's name and everybody agreed and said, and then God bless you, we'll see you next week.
