[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=34] It's great to be with you.
[time=35] And I've got an opportunity for you, an invitation really that I want to make sure each and every one of you are aware of.
[time=41] As most of you view this broadcast, it'll be Sunday, June 23rd.
[time=46] And I want you to know that next Sunday, the 30th of June, we're calling it Fusion Funday.
[time=53] And it really is a chance for all of you that call Black Hawk Home.
[time=57] And whether you're here on Sundays or part of our viewing audience, it really would be a day where you'd want to come because it's on that day that we begin, I think, the process of slowly saying goodbye to our good friends Corbin and Tanya Miller.
[time=71] The Miller family, as most of you know by now, are in the process of transitioning to a ministry in Poland with an organization called Josiah Venture.
[time=81] And the ministry they'll be running is a ministry called Fusion in the local church there in Poland.
[time=86] It's a music ministry with teenagers and they are gonna do a tremendous job, as you can imagine.
[time=93] But on that day, the 30th of June, right here at Black Hawk, come and be with us for either of the two services following second hour.
[time=101] We're gonna have a huge, all Black Hawk meal and a fun afternoon with games and activities and opportunities for you and all those in your family from every age group.
[time=113] We're gonna have a wonderful time together.
[time=115] So, June 30th, following second hour, a huge meal and lots of fun.
[time=120] And it's gonna be a chance for us to support, further understand what Corbin and Tanya are going to do and encourage them in the process of that day.
[time=129] So, you won't want to miss it.
[time=130] Bring your friends, bring your family, and we're gonna have a great, great time.
[time=134] Fusion, Sunday, Sunday, June 30th, I hope each and every one of you will come and communicate in your own words to Corbin and Tanya, your gratitude and your thanks for their 11 years of faithful, faithful, excellent service.
[time=147] Hey, God bless you.
[time=148] Hope you'll be there then.
[time=150] Hope you'll come and see us sometime soon.
[time=152] We're grateful for each and every one of you.

[time=1365] To love you from the inside out.
[time=1375] Hey open your Bibles if you would this morning.
[time=1377] Let's jump back into our study of 1 John.
[time=1380] Today we come to 1 John chapter 3 verses 4 to 10.
[time=1384] The truth about sin.
[time=1386] That's right.
[time=1387] We want to talk this morning.
[time=1388] We want to open our hearts and our minds and our lives to the Word of God.
[time=1393] And what it says regarding sin.
[time=1396] John as I've told you in weeks gone by he's concerned about the foundation of these people.
[time=1403] Their faith in Christ.
[time=1405] Their place and their part in the church.
[time=1407] It's being attacked.
[time=1409] It's being undermined by the Gnostics.
[time=1412] And so he feels the need to come back and address things that are so very important for us as believers to understand and know.
[time=1421] In the past I've told you as we read through 1 John that we come to sections that we could kind of classify as tests.
[time=1429] Tests of doctrine.
[time=1431] There are other passages that we come to that we could kind of classify as tests.
[time=1436] Ethical tests.
[time=1438] In other words how we live out.
[time=1440] The doctrine that we believe to be true.
[time=1443] My friends today you get a combination of both.
[time=1446] Today will be both doctrine.
[time=1448] It's important that you know the truth about sin.
[time=1453] And important that you understand how to live out that truth in a way that guards and guides you in your navigating in your journey down your path.
[time=1463] In my journey down mine and the opportunities we have every day.
[time=1468] To deal with sin and its temptation.
[time=1471] 1 John chapter 3 verses 4 to 10 if you would read along everyone who practices sin.
[time=1479] Also practices lawlessness and sin is lawlessness.
[time=1485] You know that he Christ appeared in order to take away sins.
[time=1490] And in him there is no sin.
[time=1492] No one who abides in him sins.
[time=1495] No one who sins has seen him or knows him.
[time=1501] Little children make sure no one deceives you.
[time=1504] The one who practices righteousness is righteous.
[time=1507] Just as he is righteous.
[time=1509] The one who practices sin is of the devil.
[time=1513] For the devil has sinned from the beginning.
[time=1516] The son of God appeared.
[time=1517] Christ came for this purpose to destroy the works of the devil.
[time=1524] No one, no one who is born of God practices sin.
[time=1535] Because his seed abides in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God.
[time=1541] By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious.
[time=1547] Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God nor the one who does not love his brother.
[time=1556] 3 things I want you to see this morning will make our way through all 3.
[time=1560] Why John addresses sin?
[time=1562] There is a reason John goes to such great lengths to address sin.
[time=1566] I want you to see that and understand that this morning.
[time=1569] Secondly we are going to see this really helpful, really practical right from the text analysis of sin.
[time=1576] John takes this whole thing called sin and in just a few verses he breaks it down and really gives you and gives me something we can hold on to.
[time=1585] To help us understand and tackle it better.
[time=1588] And then thirdly we are going to look at the relationship between a true believer and sin.
[time=1595] What is that relationship between a true believer and sin?
[time=1598] Number one why John addresses sin in short and simply stated my friends.
[time=1604] He addresses it because the Gnostics who were infatuated with the spiritual.
[time=1611] We have talked about this.
[time=1612] The Gnostics the false teachers that they were infiltrating the church.
[time=1616] These were some people and it was a philosophy that was infatuated with the spiritual with the mind.
[time=1624] And the Gnostics said that sin wasn't a big deal.
[time=1630] They said sin wasn't a big deal.
[time=1632] They said sin was something that the body engaged in.
[time=1637] And since Gnostics believed that the body was inconsequential and of no real concern, they said sin all you want.
[time=1647] How do you like that?
[time=1650] Sin all you want.
[time=1652] It will actually serve to increase your knowledge of the world, they said.
[time=1657] And knowledge was to them king and so sin was inevitably and actually encouraged.
[time=1664] Think about that my friends just for a moment.
[time=1668] Go ahead.
[time=1670] Sin all you want.
[time=1673] It just doesn't really matter.
[time=1677] This was their thought.
[time=1679] This was in essence their slogan.
[time=1682] And I think most of you know in your hearts I certainly know and understand in mind.
[time=1687] And the Apostle John was crystal clear on this.
[time=1690] That is a stupid thought.
[time=1696] That is insane.
[time=1698] That is mindless.
[time=1701] It truly is spiritually.
[time=1704] It's crazy, it's a self-destructive and life debilitating thought.
[time=1710] I want to remind you quickly this morning that unchecked patterns of sin, sin delved into willingly again and again and again and again sin, sin embraced intentionally again and again and again creates three things.
[time=1727] And I hope you'll write these things down.
[time=1729] Please be reminded this morning on this general sin discussion and the idea of the Gnostics.
[time=1735] And listen, listen, forget the Gnostics.
[time=1738] Go ahead and sin.
[time=1740] It's no big deal.
[time=1742] It's the message of today.
[time=1745] It's what you hear.
[time=1747] It's what our kids hear.
[time=1749] It is the mindset of our society and our culture today.
[time=1754] And let me just remind you unchecked patterns of sin will always lead to these three things.
[time=1760] Number one, write it down a callist heart.
[time=1764] It will lead to a callist heart in you.
[time=1768] A heart that gets smaller and smaller.
[time=1771] A heart that gets harder and harder.
[time=1774] More and more sin brings more and more darkness.
[time=1779] More guilt, more shame, less light, diminishing feelings.
[time=1785] Less kindness, thoughtfulness and sensitivity are slowly but surely deleted from your world.
[time=1795] And you end up with a callist, small, hard heart.
[time=1799] Many of you in the room have lived in that pattern.
[time=1802] Many of you in the room this morning have experienced those days and those weeks and those months
[time=1808] or maybe even those years of that kind of living.
[time=1812] And you know what it's like.
[time=1815] You've felt that heart shrink.
[time=1818] You know what it's like to have kindness and thoughtfulness and sensitivity deleted from your soul.
[time=1826] A callist heart, is that how you want to live?
[time=1831] It's what you'll get with unchecked ongoing sin.
[time=1837] Here we learn this.
[time=1839] We learn that unchecked patterns of sin creates a self-consumed focus.
[time=1848] A self-consumed focus.
[time=1851] You see the eyes, your eyes, mine, our eyes, our vision.
[time=1856] When we find ourselves, when we keep ourselves in these unchecked patterns of sin.
[time=1862] You see the eyes of a person who's in that state are turned completely inward.
[time=1867] And this one's actually pretty easy to describe for when you, when you pursue sin without restraint.
[time=1875] When you plan, think and strategize to satisfy you and please you again and again and again
[time=1886] simply you become consumed with, guess who?
[time=1890] You.
[time=1892] And everyone else in your world becomes a distant, if even that, a distant side note.
[time=1899] Sin, births, a self-consumed focus because remember this morning gang, sin is about you.
[time=1906] It's about what you want.
[time=1909] It's about your ideas.
[time=1912] It's about your lust.
[time=1913] It's about your thoughts.
[time=1915] And when you strategize and plan again and again and again and it's unchecked and ongoing
[time=1921] you just become this person that thinks only about you.
[time=1928] It's interesting for me as I learn from my own recovery on some fronts and as I have been
[time=1935] befriended by and encouraged by dear brothers and sisters who are in recovery as well.
[time=1940] I think of some of our celebrate recovery friends who mean so much to me and they've taught me about addiction.
[time=1946] They've taught me about recovery.
[time=1949] It's interesting, you know, booze.
[time=1951] I think about some of my recovering alcoholic friends.
[time=1954] Booze doesn't, liquor doesn't blow up a family.
[time=1960] Don't be deceived.
[time=1963] Booze doesn't destroy relationships.
[time=1967] It's the selfishness of that individual that blows that thing up.
[time=1972] It is the absolute utter insidious selfishness that blows those situations sky high.
[time=1982] It's what happens when sin is left unchecked.
[time=1985] We become selfishly consumed.
[time=1988] Thirdly, I hope you'll write this down, left unchecked.
[time=1991] Sin will bring about ruin.
[time=1995] One word, ruin.
[time=1998] It will ruin you financially.
[time=2001] It will ruin you personally.
[time=2005] It will ruin your family.
[time=2007] It will ruin your spiritual life.
[time=2009] It is at the core of Satan's attempt.
[time=2012] It is at the core of his motivation.
[time=2015] He wants to dismantle you.
[time=2019] And left unchecked, he will.
[time=2024] So you see it there?
[time=2025] It gives you a callous, hard, a self-consumed focus and it ruins you so the Gnostics were
[time=2031] dead wrong.
[time=2033] And so is our culture today.
[time=2035] It does matter.
[time=2037] There is a great deal at stake.
[time=2041] Sin really does have consequences.
[time=2043] And so John in verses 4 to 8, let's keep going through the passage.
[time=2046] John, watch this in verses 4 to 8.
[time=2049] It gives us this quick but really profound analysis of sin.
[time=2055] And analysis of sin might sound a little complicated.
[time=2058] Oh, it's not.
[time=2059] Wait till you see it.
[time=2060] And I want to say this to you this morning family.
[time=2062] This is what I'm going to give you right here.
[time=2064] If you take some notes on this and write some things down, you should literally, you should look at this at the beginning of every week.
[time=2071] This is something you should talk through with your kids.
[time=2074] This is something you should think through as a couple.
[time=2076] This is something on your own as an individual.
[time=2079] You should just remind yourself of this truth about sin.
[time=2086] Whether you're 18, whether you're 30, 40, 50, 60, doesn't matter.
[time=2090] These are truths that you're about to hear that really can make a difference if you understand
[time=2096] them and then are able to act on them.
[time=2100] So here you are.
[time=2101] A quick analysis of sin.
[time=2104] What sin, number one, John lets us see very clearly what sin is.
[time=2110] Important parents, especially that you help your kids understand this.
[time=2114] Sin is a crime.
[time=2120] Look at verse four.
[time=2122] Everyone who practices sin also practices, say it, church out loud, lawlessness.
[time=2129] And sin is lawlessness.
[time=2131] So important that we say the truth to ourselves about sin.
[time=2136] Sin is a deliberate, not accidental, quick side note, nobody accidentally, what, sins.
[time=2147] You don't accidentally sin.
[time=2150] Sin is a deliberate choice that you make and I make.
[time=2154] It is a breaking of God's perfect law.
[time=2158] God's design altered by you because you want to obey you and not him.
[time=2167] You say that sounds so rigid and confining.
[time=2171] It is.
[time=2173] It's very rigid.
[time=2175] It's very black and white.
[time=2178] It's very true.
[time=2180] There are no fuzzy parts there.
[time=2184] It says black and white as it gets, sin is lawlessness.
[time=2189] It is a crime.
[time=2190] It is you.
[time=2191] It's me breaking his perfect design that he gives us the chance to follow because we want to obey us instead of him.
[time=2200] What sin is?
[time=2201] It's a crime.
[time=2202] What sin does?
[time=2203] Verse five.
[time=2204] Look what sin does.
[time=2205] You know, he says, that he appeared in order to take away sins and in him there is no sin.
[time=2214] That's what sin does, church.
[time=2216] Sin undoes.
[time=2217] Write this down.
[time=2218] It undoes the work of Christ.
[time=2223] Not really, but practically it does.
[time=2229] Jesus Christ.
[time=2231] The Gospels teach us Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God sacrificed to take away the what?
[time=2237] To take away the sins of the world.
[time=2242] To sin is to bring back into play what the Lord abolished and he really did abolish it.
[time=2251] He really did remove its power.
[time=2252] We'll talk about this later.
[time=2254] He really did remove its capacity to rule and reign over you.
[time=2259] He came and he abolished it and when you and I choose to deliberately step back into it,
[time=2265] we bring back into play that which he nullified.
[time=2272] It's like an individual I spoke with recently who I love and I am for this individual and
[time=2281] this individual is working faithfully, tirelessly working, has been for a number of years with
[time=2288] a certain addiction.
[time=2290] This addiction has to do with the computer.
[time=2294] And in light of this addiction and the years of struggle, like maybe even some of you have discovered there are some helps these days, there are some filters, there are some warnings,
[time=2305] there are some technology things that can be employed on a laptop or a home computer.
[time=2312] And they've actually gotten pretty good.
[time=2316] They've gotten really efficient at sending messages to accountability partners, at hitting
[time=2323] the warning signs and people in this individual's life know about it and it's probably not
[time=2329] foolproof but I'll tell you what, it goes a long, long way in abolishing and removing
[time=2336] from an individual's choices something they desperately want to move away from.
[time=2342] So I'm talking to this guy and one day he just told me, yeah, he just took off the filter.
[time=2350] He just kind of told me he'd taken off the filter and I just thought, wow, why would
[time=2356] you do that?
[time=2359] I know why, you know why, but why put back in play, that which had been removed, that's
[time=2370] what sinned us, met with a family recently, four or five years battling financial freedom
[time=2381] and they just felt heavy-hearted because they had about six months prior cut up their eighth credit card and two months after that, one of them had figured out a way to secure a ninth.
[time=2392] And I just think why do you, you know, why do that?
[time=2395] Why when you take steps to remove something, why do you step back in and I'm asking you
[time=2401] and you should be asking me, that's what sin does.
[time=2406] It undoes the work of Christ.
[time=2409] Why sin is, why sin exists?
[time=2411] Look at verse six, no one who abides in him, underline that circle, that highlight that,
[time=2417] no one who abides in him, sins, no one who sins has seen him or knows him, seeing him,
[time=2426] knowing him, words, phrases that characterize and define what it means to abide in him.
[time=2435] Why it exists, you want to know why sin exists?
[time=2437] Here you go, write this down, your sin is the product of failing to abide in Christ.
[time=2441] You get it right from the text, your sin in mind, it is the result, it is the product of failing to abide in Christ.
[time=2449] What does it mean?
[time=2450] What does it look like to abide in Christ?
[time=2452] It means to walk with him, it means to talk with him, it means to listen to him when you
[time=2458] read, take in, memorize, meditate on his word, when you abide with him, surround yourself
[time=2467] and your life with the things of him.
[time=2470] When you are doing this, my friends, I can tell you from personal experience that sins
[time=2478] glitter fades, it really truthfully does.
[time=2488] His allurement sends attractiveness, sends interest, fades.
[time=2498] The more and more and more you and I abide, this is abiding in him.
[time=2505] When my life, my head, my heart is surrounded by him and I'm telling you when you don't,
[time=2511] when you choose to live outside the presence of Christ, when you choose not to abide, sins,
[time=2517] glitter gets brighter and even more alluring.
[time=2528] What sin is, what sin does, why sin exists, where sin comes from, oh please don't be confused
[time=2537] about this one.
[time=2539] Where does sin come from?
[time=2541] In verse 8, the one who practices sin is of the what, say it, church, the devil.
[time=2548] For the devil has sinned from the beginning.
[time=2553] Important to keep in mind, the sin that tempts you, the sin that you flirt with, the sin that you engage in, the sin that comes at you and me every single day in multiple forms.
[time=2565] Please be reminded today, sin comes directly to you from Satan.
[time=2574] There's no broker, there's no intermediary, there's no nothing in, I don't know why God did it this way, I'm not sure why he allowed it, but God in his sovereignty has allowed Satan himself access, doesn't have power, doesn't have authority, but he's got access
[time=2594] to you.
[time=2595] And please be reminded today, sin comes to you directly from Satan himself.
[time=2602] It doesn't come from Hollywood.
[time=2606] It doesn't come from a website, it doesn't come from a bad past, it's not an ungodly
[time=2612] spouse, sin doesn't come from a tough work environment, sin comes from the devil, which
[time=2619] is why I am so grateful for what it says in James 4.
[time=2625] Look in your Bibles, or you can see it on the screen, James 4/7, submit, James says,
[time=2631] listen believer, he says submit therefore to God, resist the devil, submit therefore
[time=2641] to God, resist the devil, resist, it means to say what, say it louder, no.
[time=2649] Can you say no, yes or no, yes, I'm going to trick you here.
[time=2656] Can every one of you, those of you who know the Lord and have fully surrendered your heart and life to the Lord, and because of that we know, because the Scripture, that
[time=2667] the Spirit of God resides in you, and with that Spirit comes power.
[time=2671] I am asking you, every one of you that knows him, can you, do you have the capacity to say
[time=2679] no, yes, submit therefore to God, resist the devil, say no, and I love this, he will what?
[time=2692] The devil will, the Bible says the devil will flee from you, and I'm telling you, he will,
[time=2699] it's true to someone who is sound and resolved and firm in their know, to someone who is abiding
[time=2707] in Christ, voicing and articulating their know, he will flee.
[time=2714] It's the truth, the Word of God promises it and it's real.
[time=2722] Where sin comes from, lastly, how sin is conquered.
[time=2725] You see it there at the end of verse 8, back to 1 John 3, it says the Son of God, here
[time=2735] it is, the Son of God appeared for this reason, the Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil.
[time=2744] How sin is conquered through the work of Jesus Christ, write it down, through the work of Jesus Christ, what Jesus Christ did, who he was, what he came to do, he did it.
[time=2756] This is so good.
[time=2759] The work of Jesus Christ destroyed, canceled, eliminates the work of the devil.
[time=2764] Satan, please understand this to be true, some of you don't know this to be true, and for some of you, the fact that you don't know this to be true, it's killing you.
[time=2775] Satan has no power over you, Satan has no pull with you, he really doesn't, you give
[time=2783] him power and we allow him to, he has no power, he has no pull, Satan has no authority and
[time=2790] no influence, because Jesus Christ, praise God, Jesus Christ, our Lord, really came to
[time=2798] this earth and really squared off with Satan in the wilderness outside of Galilee.
[time=2806] It really happened, he came and in that encounter, and obviously there were other encounters along the way, but symbolically that encounter in that wilderness outside of Galilee where
[time=2818] Satan came and gave Jesus his best three shots.
[time=2823] And Jesus on all three occasions said what, no, watch this, Jesus submitted himself to
[time=2835] who, God, he resisted the devil, said what, say it again, no.
[time=2845] And what did Satan do, he left.
[time=2849] You wonder if James 4-7 is true, all my friends, it's as true as the day is long, and Jesus
[time=2855] gives you a model and he gives me an example to follow, submit to God, say, say no, not
[time=2861] going to do it.
[time=2864] Satan leaves and it says there in the gospels that the angels came and ministered to the Lord.
[time=2871] Through him, through Christ, you want to know why we're always so interested, why we're always so wanting you to embrace Christ, you want to know why we do this, why again and
[time=2882] again we stand here and say, oh, that you would know him, oh, that he would come into your heart and life because of him, only in connection to him, only in relationship with
[time=2893] Christ can sin be conquered because he's the one who conquered it, and he's the only way
[time=2900] to defeat it in your life.
[time=2903] 1 Corinthians 15, 1 Corinthians 15, I don't know if this will be on the screen, just look
[time=2910] in your Bibles.
[time=2911] What a great, great couple of verses, 1 Corinthians 15-55, oh, death, oh, death, where is your
[time=2921] victory, oh, death, where is your sting, the sting of death is what, say it, sin and the
[time=2929] power of sin is the law, but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our best
[time=2936] efforts, no.
[time=2939] Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our religion, no.
[time=2945] Thanks be to God who gives us our victory, our one and only victory through the one and
[time=2951] only Lord Jesus Christ, amen, amen.
[time=2959] An analysis of sin.
[time=2960] You should just take those points, you should write them out in your own words, you should look at that, pray through that, talk about that.
[time=2966] You and I should do battle each and every day with those kinds of things in mind.
[time=2972] Now he comes to verse 9, oh, verse 9, what a verse so much to say.
[time=2977] I know it raises a lot of questions.
[time=2979] Let me just try and kind of whittle it down for us this morning.
[time=2982] We see here the relationship, I believe, that God desires for true believers.
[time=2987] Are you in?
[time=2989] He says, here you go.
[time=2992] Here is how you can understand and dissect that question a little bit better.
[time=2998] He says, no one who is truly, no one who is born of God practices sin can't because his
[time=3008] seed, God's seed abides in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God.
[time=3016] A well-known scholar once said this about verse 9, it is the text of 1 John.
[time=3024] It is the text of Holy Scripture that forces us to abandon our fleshly excuses and consider
[time=3031] again the possibility of personal piety and holiness.
[time=3036] Yes, I like that.
[time=3039] The possibility of personal piety and holiness.
[time=3045] Now here is the deal, here is the deal on the tension of verse 9.
[time=3051] There is, hear me, there is some relief, I say relief because this whole room is tense
[time=3057] right now.
[time=3060] I say relief because every one of you is sort of thinking in one way or another in your mind, am I, am I host here?
[time=3070] Because I kind of thought I was in, I raised my hand, I fully surrendered but let me tell you, I mean I will raise my hand, you don't have to raise yours.
[time=3079] It feels to me like a lot of times I practice sin and that just told me I am out if that
[time=3088] is me because anyone who is born of God doesn't practice sin.
[time=3094] So there is a little relief from that tension.
[time=3098] Let me just tell you in the grammar, and we have talked about this before, in the grammar in the actual etymology of these words and it is important sometimes to be able to do that, there is some relief, let me explain that relief to you here just quickly.
[time=3114] The relief is found in the grammar of the wording practices sin, that is the key phrase,
[time=3120] that is the ball game in this tension that we are all feeling right now.
[time=3124] And that phrase practices sin means this, and if this is you, you are in trouble.
[time=3135] It means continuous without stop, continuous ongoing and habitual sin up and to the right
[time=3145] without any breaks, the sin just keeps ongoing without any heartfelt pause, without sensitivity,
[time=3154] spiritually or any movement at all toward repentance.
[time=3158] This is ongoing, it is habitual, it is up and to the right, there is no break and it is without feeling and without thought, it's kind of like you saying this is who I am and I am going.
[time=3172] And if that is you then he is saying you probably need to reconsider some things.
[time=3178] So I sense, the sense I get, and here is where it gets a little concerning for me, the sense
[time=3184] I get is that what I just described to you, most Christians and many of us in the room
[time=3190] this morning hear that explanation and as soon as I just explained that real quick, many of you just thought this, you thought, oh, good, okay, well that makes me feel better.
[time=3204] And I would ask you, it makes you feel better about what?
[time=3212] And you if you were honest, you would say to me, well, it makes me feel better about
[time=3218] my sin and I would say to you, I'm not so sure, I want you to feel better about your sin.
[time=3230] But that's kind of how we think and it's kind of how we've gone, it's kind of the road we've traveled, makes us feel better about our sin.
[time=3239] I fear sometimes, listen church, I fear sometimes that we've allowed for too much on this front
[time=3246] and in this discussion, too many times in the sin discussion, we say things like this.
[time=3251] We say, I know, we forecast, think about it, we forecast and we predict, we literally say
[time=3261] things like, I know I'm going to screw up, we say that, I know, I know I'm going to sit.
[time=3272] We say, we say, failure is inevitable, but at least I'm going to try.
[time=3277] I mean, I know it's going to happen, but at least I'm going to try.
[time=3281] We say, hey, listen, we say, hey, I'm not perfect as if we were making it about you being perfect.
[time=3288] Nobody's making this about you being perfect, but what we say is, hey, I'm not perfect.
[time=3295] Sin happens.
[time=3297] If you're an airline mechanic, you get fired for saying that, but somehow we're okay being
[time=3304] Christians.
[time=3306] I mean, who does that?
[time=3310] Who predicts and who forecasts their failure?
[time=3314] Often, who sets the bar so low?
[time=3320] And you're sitting there right now going, yeah, this is about sin, this isn't about nuts and bolts, I'm talking about the principle of how you and I approach this.
[time=3335] And what I'm saying is this, I think 1 John 3 9, I think the grammar of the sentence yes,
[time=3342] I think it does give us some perspective.
[time=3348] But I wonder if maybe we should rethink our bar.
[time=3352] I don't think that, and I know for certain, I'm not standing here saying to all of you that somehow we should now institute some desire for or some corporate personal thing
[time=3363] at Blackhawk where we're now going to just try and be perfect.
[time=3367] I'm not saying that, but I'm not as comfortable anymore forecasting and predicting my failure.
[time=3375] I think the bar should be a little bit higher.
[time=3377] I think you and I should be a little bit more mindful of that.
[time=3382] I think about, I was thinking about my celebrate recovery friends and I was with Steve McMaster
[time=3389] first hour and I just realized in my friendship with Steve, Steve's been sober for 32 years.
[time=3397] For 32, listen, don't flip flop on me, just stay with me.
[time=3403] For 32 years, he has said no every single day.
[time=3412] It's wrong, it's unhealthy, it'll kill him and he walks by bars and he sees commercials
[time=3421] and he has stuff every single day for 32 years, he has said no.
[time=3431] You and I, we predict and we forecast our failure on a daily basis and in so doing, give us
[time=3437] some kind of cushion that we can fall back on because hey, I'm not perfect.
[time=3444] Don't, here you go, try this on for size, don't sin.
[time=3451] Don't sin, be sober, say no, don't do it and wherever your mind's going right now, don't
[time=3460] let it and understand that I understand that but understand I'm trying to get you to change
[time=3467] the bar and I'm trying to get us to adjust the height and I'm trying to get us to understand and reconsider personal piety and holiness maybe in a way that might actually be healthy.
[time=3479] Don't sin, maybe that should be what we lead with instead of hey, it happens.
[time=3490] [MUSIC], so.
