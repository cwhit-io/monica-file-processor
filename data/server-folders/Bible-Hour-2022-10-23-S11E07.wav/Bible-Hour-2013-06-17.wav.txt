[time=1046] - First John is a difficult book
[time=1061] and a wonderful, wonderful letter.
[time=1064] It is laden with challenges
[time=1070] to reach for a bar that's unreachable and our love for God and our love for others.
[time=1078] And at the same time affirms those of us
[time=1084] who trusted Christ as our Savior by the grace of God.
[time=1088] And it can be hard.
[time=1091] I used to have not every class that I taught, but several classes that I taught, I'd have them read first John at the beginning of the year and I'd give them time in the class period to read through the whole book of first John.
[time=1105] And without comment, some would come up afterward
[time=1111] and say, I need to talk about this because they were challenged.
[time=1118] It was really tough.
[time=1120] And sometimes it was tough because they really didn't know the Lord and they discovered that as they read through first John.
[time=1130] Powerful book, deserves our attention.
[time=1138] And here in first John chapter three, we're gonna cover verses 11 through 24 today.
[time=1145] It's the same message that God gave the children of Israel
[time=1152] and Deuteronomy six, Leviticus 19, we'll get there in a minute.
[time=1156] Same message, new power in the Holy Spirit, new power to move toward that challenge that He gives us.
[time=1168] Let's read first John chapter three verses 11 through 24.
[time=1175] This is the message you heard from the beginning.
[time=1180] We should love one another.
[time=1185] Do not be like Cain who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother.
[time=1190] I think a better translation there, I will give the NASB credit on this one.
[time=1196] It says of the evil one and the NASB, I think that's better and some of the NIV translators actually have said that's a better translation now.
[time=1206] Who was of the evil one and murdered his brother.
[time=1215] And why did he murder him?
[time=1217] Because his own actions were evil and his brothers were righteous.
[time=1223] Murder someone for righteous acts.
[time=1227] Do not be surprised my brothers at the world hate you.
[time=1233] We know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers.
[time=1238] Anyone who does not love remains in death.
[time=1242] Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him.
[time=1248] This is how we know what love is.
[time=1252] Jesus Christ laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.
[time=1262] If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him?
[time=1274] Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.
[time=1281] This then is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence whenever our hearts condemn us.
[time=1289] For God is greater than our hearts and he knows everything.
[time=1297] Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from him anything we ask because, big because there.
[time=1310] We obey his commands and do what pleases him.
[time=1320] And this is his command to believe in the name
[time=1328] of his son Jesus Christ and to love one another as he commanded us.
[time=1332] Those who obey his commands live in him and he in them.
[time=1337] And this is how we know that he lives in us.
[time=1340] We know it by the spirit he gave us.
[time=1344] Lord help us understand this passage, please.
[time=1350] Loving our brothers is confirmation of our salvation.
[time=1362] Now you can say no, I love people all the time.
[time=1365] Loving our brothers the way God intends us to love our brothers is not natural.
[time=1371] I can't do it in my flesh.
[time=1375] Loving my brothers and my sisters the way God intends me to lay my life down for them is only possible in him.
[time=1390] Believers are to love God and love others just as it had been taught to the Jews and to God's chosen in Deuteronomy 6, Leviticus 19, Matthew 22.
[time=1401] Those who love God are people who love others.
[time=1405] You can spot them.
[time=1406] 1 John 3, 11.
[time=1411] John says this is the message you have heard from the beginning is this isn't new.
[time=1419] Nothing new about this message, the message is.
[time=1424] God has been telling us since he first started to reveal himself to us through the law and the prophets that we are to love him, Deuteronomy 6, with all of our heart, with all of our soul, with all of our mind, we're responsible to love him with everything in our being.
[time=1450] It's an old message.
[time=1453] Jesus said in Matthew 22, Matthew reveals this story.
[time=1461] This Pharisee shows up and Matthew 22 says
[time=1469] that the Pharisee asked this question to test Jesus.
[time=1476] Interesting, I always like it when they test him.
[time=1480] They get tested and so do I.
[time=1485] He tests him and he says, what's the greatest commandment?
[time=1489] And Jesus said, in Matthew 22 account,
[time=1495] he answers him and says, Deuteronomy 6, love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength.
[time=1502] And then Jesus adds to that what it says in Leviticus 19.
[time=1506] And Jesus says, and love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=1510] And then he goes on.
[time=1512] And Jesus says to this Pharisee who's trying to stump them, he says, all of the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments.
[time=1523] There's a master set here that includes the rest of all the subsets.
[time=1531] The master set is to love God and love others.
[time=1535] Pretty simple, huh?
[time=1541] Really simple, just incredibly hard to do.
[time=1548] Not complicated, me give myself up for God
[time=1555] and me give myself up for you.
[time=1562] Not complicated, just hard.
[time=1566] The catch of the day, young people,
[time=1574] is we know we are in God's family because we love our brothers and sisters.
[time=1582] It's confirmation that he's adopted us.
[time=1590] That's why we love because he told us to.
[time=1594] Then in 1 John 3, 12 through 18,
[time=1601] John tells us what love isn't, what love is,
[time=1607] and what to expect when we love appropriately.
[time=1611] What love isn't, what love is, and what to expect from the world.
[time=1620] When we love God and love people appropriately.
[time=1623] Look at verse 12, "Do not be like Cain
[time=1630] "who belonged to the evil one, or was of the evil one, "and murdered his brother." Why did he murder him?
[time=1639] Because his own actions were evil and his brothers were righteous.
[time=1647] He murdered Abel because Abel acted righteously.
[time=1652] That's a twist, isn't it?
[time=1656] You see, the Bible says that Cain tilled the soil.
[time=1662] Cain was a keeper of crops.
[time=1673] And Cain brought, it says, in Genesis 4, Cain brought some of the fruit of his crops as a sacrifice to God.
[time=1685] That's the description, some of the fruit.
[time=1687] It also says that Abel, who kept flocks,
[time=1696] brought the fatted portion of his firstborn.
[time=1704] That's like the primo of the primo.
[time=1707] And God found favor and told Cain in Abel
[time=1715] that he favored Abel's gift.
[time=1719] Now, in reality, Cain, if he was gonna murder someone, should have murdered God.
[time=1726] Abel didn't do anything to Cain.
[time=1732] God told Cain his sacrifice wasn't worthy.
[time=1736] Don't we often misplace, misdirect,
[time=1743] our anger and our frustration toward people when sometimes it would have been healthy for us to pray an angry prayer to God.
[time=1752] David did it often.
[time=1755] Cast all your anxiety on me because I care for you.
[time=1761] He can handle our anxiety.
[time=1764] But when we misdirect it, we murder people who are innocent with our hate, with our jealousy.
[time=1772] I was trying to think of what's a practical, good illustration of the kind of hatred that we have here on earth, one toward another.
[time=1784] And my first thought was eighth grade girls.
[time=1788] (congregation laughing) They're the meanest people on the planet.
[time=1792] (congregation laughing) Mostly to each other.
[time=1798] This kind of starts in fifth, and then it builds and crescendos about eighth.
[time=1805] And I'm so thankful, the ninth, tenth, and eleventh, it really starts to go down and they get real sweet when the boys are nasty and awful.
[time=1811] Girls have a tendency to have a friend
[time=1817] in starting about the fifth grade, they have a friend, and then they go through about the eighth grade with a friend, and their friendship, a lot of it, revolves around what they're saying about the other people who aren't in their relationship.
[time=1832] Oh, you guys are naughty.
[time=1834] Women know this.
[time=1835] And then, if this thing happens, this is disastrous.
[time=1842] If somebody comes along and steals one of these people from the other, that person is cursed and doomed.
[time=1854] Why?
[time=1857] Jealousy.
[time=1861] Cain was jealous of Abel's righteousness,
[time=1872] his right living, and the way around it, there were two options.
[time=1879] Cain becomes a right liver, or he kills him, who's the example of righteousness, and he chose that.
[time=1888] Second point is love is laying down my life.
[time=1899] Love's not jealousy, that's what it's not.
[time=1902] What it is is laying down my life.
[time=1905] Jesus did that for us.
[time=1909] Scriptures are laden with that.
[time=1911] 1 John 3, 16 to 18.
[time=1915] This is how we know what love is.
[time=1916] Jesus Christ laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.
[time=1922] What?
[time=1924] That's too much.
[time=1925] Wow.
[time=1932] If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need, but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him?
[time=1940] John asks.
[time=1941] Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue, but with actions and in truth.
[time=1949] Philippians 2 says that I am to consider you as more important than myself, that I'm to do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit.
[time=1959] I'm not so supposed to live life for me.
[time=1962] I'm supposed to live life for him and for you.
[time=1966] The hymn part I get, you don't deserve it.
[time=1969] But he wants me to consider you as though you do deserve it.
[time=1974] He wants me to lay down my life for you.
[time=1980] That shows up in lots of different forms that are hard.
[time=1989] In Deuteronomy 15, God laid out a plan.
[time=1993] If there's a poor man with you, one of your brothers, in any of your towns and your land, which the Lord your God has given you, you shall not harden your heart, nor close your hand from your poor brother.
[time=2006] But you shall freely open your hand to him and shall generously lend him sufficient for his need in whatever he lacks.
[time=2017] We're to walk among the poor.
[time=2019] We're open-handed.
[time=2020] Beware that there is no base thought in your heart saying the seventh year, the year of remission is near.
[time=2027] They get off the hook then, and your eye is hostile toward your poor brother and you give him nothing.
[time=2034] Then he may cry to the Lord against you and it will be a sin in you.
[time=2039] You shall generously give to him and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him because for this thing, the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in all your undertakings.
[time=2051] For the poor will never cease to be in the land.
[time=2055] Therefore I command you saying, you shall freely open your hand to your brother, to your needy and poor in your land.
[time=2063] Is that incredible?
[time=2066] He wants us to walk among the poor with what they need in our hands and openly offering it to them.
[time=2078] Be open-handed with your stuff for those in need.
[time=2083] James says the same thing, James 2, 14 to 17.
[time=2089] It says, what uses it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but he has no works, can that faith save him?
[time=2097] If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, and one of you says to them, go in peace, be warmed and be filled, yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body.
[time=2108] What use is that, even so, faith, if it has no works, is dead being by itself?
[time=2116] What's it mean to lay down my life?
[time=2123] What's it mean to give up my stuff?
[time=2126] It means that I will choose to love you and discern what's best for you then if yes is best for you, I'll say yes.
[time=2139] If no is best for you, I'll say no.
[time=2142] I will say this, it's a lot easier to say yes lovingly than no, because when I say yes to your need,
[time=2154] what you perceive your need to be, I feel love back.
[time=2159] When I say no to the need you think you have, but if I've discerned what's best for you is no.
[time=2167] Then I don't get the love back, it's very hard to do.
[time=2174] As a husband, as a dad, as an employer, as any person in a position of responsibility and authority, it's our job to be discerning enough to know what's best for those whom we serve as leader and say yes when yes is best for them, that's love,
[time=2194] and no when no is best for them, that's love.
[time=2198] How you doing?
[time=2203] How you doing at walking through life, open-handed
[time=2209] and willing to say no when they're not gonna be happy?
[time=2214] How you doing?
[time=2216] John says that we need to be willing to love one another
[time=2223] appropriately.
[time=2224] Denny Howard introduced me to a book in 1991,
[time=2232] I actually figured out the date, called the Five Love Languages.
[time=2238] Gary Chapman wrote it, and many of you have probably read it.
[time=2240] It's excellent.
[time=2241] It helped me think through the reality that I love often
[time=2247] the way I like to be loved rather than the way they like to be loved.
[time=2253] It helped me realize that Nancy loves words of encouragement
[time=2259] and my time.
[time=2263] Those are two of the love languages that Gary Chapman spells out.
[time=2268] She loves a card with something written on it.
[time=2272] I love touch and very expensive gifts.
[time=2278] (audience laughing) I don't want Daily Nick Maxx.
[time=2285] She doesn't either.
[time=2289] The other love language is acts of service.
[time=2294] Some people really feel loved when you serve them.
[time=2297] She doesn't want me to vacuum the carpet, she's very picky about that.
[time=2303] But there are a few acts of service I can do.
[time=2306] Squeeze you the shower, stuff like that.
[time=2312] I need to know how she feels loved in order to love her appropriately.
[time=2316] And I need to know her so well that I know those things about her.
[time=2321] And I should know you that way too.
[time=2324] And I should be able to filter what you want through what he says is best for you.
[time=2331] And I needed to do that for my children and for my wife.
[time=2336] Filter through his word what is best, not what you want, not what makes you happy, not what makes me happy because you're happy, but what is best for you.
[time=2347] And sometimes we're not happy when that's a reality in our life.
[time=2355] I was thinking about how bizarre some of the paradigms
[time=2366] are that we construct in our culture and how much different they are from gods.
[time=2375] For instance, I used to use that Philippians to passage off and with basketball teams that I coached and trying to help them think through how to consider others as more important than yourself when you're trying to drub them was hard.
[time=2389] You know why?
[time=2390] I don't think drubbing them is in God's paradigm.
[time=2396] I'm in Indiana, gotta be careful.
[time=2398] I used to say this, why not, like at the end of the first quarter, if you have a game that's going really bad because one team's so much better than the other, why not revert back to what you did on the playground to even things up and let's just split the teams up and choose among them and then we'll finish the game having a really competitive game.
[time=2418] I know a lot of you think I'm nuts.
[time=2421] I think that probably fits God's paradigm better than it does the way we do it.
[time=2428] And believe me, I just picked basketball
[time=2434] because I knew that you'd understand that one and you'd think I was nuts.
[time=2437] But there are many of those paradigms that we live within that don't fit gods.
[time=2442] He's not looking for us to be the winner
[time=2448] and them to be the loser.
[time=2450] He's not interested in that.
[time=2454] Sometimes I actually hear people thank God that he let them win.
[time=2460] Mm.
[time=2468] He has a paradigm and a bar that's unreachable.
[time=2476] He wants me to lay down my life for you
[time=2482] and you to do the same for me and I can't get there.
[time=2487] So what should I expect when I do behave
[time=2494] the way God says we should behave?
[time=2497] What should I expect from the world?
[time=2498] John tells us.
[time=2500] Let's look now at what to expect versus 13 through 15.
[time=2504] He says do not be surprised by brothers if the world hates you.
[time=2510] We know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers.
[time=2515] Anyone who does not love remains in death.
[time=2517] Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him.
[time=2522] You see, Abel shouldn't have been surprised
[time=2529] when Cain didn't like his righteous acts
[time=2536] because the world responds to righteousness with hate.
[time=2541] We're pretty careful not to bump into them too often
[time=2550] so that we can embrace them and them us.
[time=2555] But there are some issues.
[time=2558] There are some paradigms that our culture has been developing over the past forever that are not in alignment with God.
[time=2568] And when we stand against what's normal here
[time=2574] and wrong according to what God says, we will be hated.
[time=2580] And I've asked myself, you know, first Peter, and first Peter too Peter said that we're aliens and strangers in this world and I don't feel much like an alien.
[time=2591] I don't feel that often enough.
[time=2595] I think because I'm not standing against some things that I probably should be standing more firmly against.
[time=2603] What should I expect?
[time=2607] They're gonna hate me when I stand clearly against sin.
[time=2622] Do you care more about the other person than winning?
[time=2627] I think that's a good question to ask yourself.
[time=2632] Do you care more about the other person than winning?
[time=2639] Winning may be the outcome but it is it your motive over them, that's the question.
[time=2652] And then John says, we can have confidence before God in Christ by the presence of the Holy Spirit in these last verses.
[time=2662] Wow, 19 and 20, look at that.
[time=2665] We find rest in God.
[time=2666] This then is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in His presence.
[time=2674] Look at this next part.
[time=2675] Whenever our hearts condemn us, what's that about?
[time=2683] This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in His presence whenever our hearts condemn us.
[time=2691] For God is greater than our hearts and He knows everything.
[time=2695] God the Father gives me rest through grace.
[time=2699] My heart condemns me.
[time=2702] I cannot love you the way He wants me to.
[time=2707] I am not empowered in my own flesh to do that.
[time=2710] And my heart says, Steve, you're not a lover of God, you're not a lover of man.
[time=2716] And then my heart gets rest because God's greater than my heart.
[time=2721] His grace is greater than my heart than the condemnation of my own heart.
[time=2727] Now the reality is, I think for the rest of my life on this earth, I will be struggling with condemnation that comes from my heart because I'll never live up.
[time=2739] The bar's too high, but His grace is sufficient.
[time=2744] And He gives me rest when my own heart condemns me.
[time=2748] Now that's powerful to take home today.
[time=2753] The bar's so high in my flesh, I'll never reach it.
[time=2766] I'll always live in the tension of that.
[time=2769] But we find rest in God's grace, He is greater than our hearts.
[time=2775] Then in verse 21 through 24, it says,
[time=2783] we can be confident in Christ.
[time=2786] 21, dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, hallelujah.
[time=2792] You see, there are moments that I don't feel condemned like a Saturday afternoon after a Saturday morning neighboring project.
[time=2801] You know that kind of piece that you feel?
[time=2804] You've done a good deed, you've done something good, you've helped some people, you did whatever with your small group.
[time=2809] And you feel better on Saturday afternoon about it.
[time=2812] There are times when my heart doesn't condemn me.
[time=2815] And in Christ, I can sense that and know that.
[time=2822] It's powerful.
[time=2823] Real deeds of love bring confidence in our hearts
[time=2829] that we're His, that we're His.
[time=2832] Real acts of love, sacrificial acts of love for others bring about a confidence in my heart that I'm His.
[time=2841] John wants me to enjoy that.
[time=2848] And then the last point is, we know His spirit is present.
[time=2853] I said confidence before God in Christ by the presence of the Holy Spirit, the presence of the Holy Spirit in me, it's a seal, God says in His Word.
[time=2862] He sealed me with the spirit of God.
[time=2864] I sense His presence, even when I'm sensing the conviction that He brings, I sense His presence.
[time=2878] Anytime you see love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control in me, it's evidence that the Holy Spirit is in me.
[time=2893] Those are His fruits.
[time=2894] He expresses those through us.
[time=2899] And it gives me confidence that I'm His.
[time=2905] Believers are to love God and love others.
[time=2910] Those who love God are people who love others.
[time=2917] Love one another.
[time=2922] As we think about loving one another,
[time=2933] let's just make this next song our prayer to God.
[time=2937] Steve said many times we can't do that on our own, so let's come to God with our arms open wide.
[time=2943] [MUSIC - 389 seconds]
[time=3339] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 131 seconds]
[time=3477] Oh, how you're that Oh, how you're that Oh, how you're...
[time=3507] Oh, how you're that Oh, how you love's us Oh, how you love's us Oh, how you love's
[time=3537] us Oh, how you love's us Oh, how you love's us Oh, how you love's us Oh, how you love's us
