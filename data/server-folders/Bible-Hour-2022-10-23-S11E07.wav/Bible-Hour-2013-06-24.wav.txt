[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well hello again everybody, great to have you with us and I'm so thankful for the chance to share with you this morning something that many of you have heard about others if you maybe know even more about but this is a chance for us to catch you up on a great, great situation Blackhawk finds itself in as we begin to say goodbye to Corbin and Tanya Miller.
[time=52] Corbin Miller was the worship pastor, has been the worship pastor here at Blackhawk since May of 2002 and Corbin and his wife Tanya have joined me here today, you all who have watched the Bible hour for years know that we have had Corbin and Tanya and their family and the Blackhawk family and me and many of you have had this relationship that we have so enjoyed and we've been so thankful for and we've talked about it recently, you've heard Corbin talk about it on the broadcast, you've heard me talk about it on the broadcast, you've heard us talk about it in services, these guys are leaving, saying goodbye, who knows for how long, who knows what God's gonna do but we are so very thankful for what we've sensed God doing in your guys' lives and so very thankful for what we think is ahead and I want our broadcast audience to really have a sense of who we're passing you off to because it's really important that they all know, we're not just like tossing you out the front door and saying good luck, there's a relationship with this organization that we have that you guys have that we're gonna continue to be in together, there's a place that you're going, that we're very excited about and there's a way that the broadcast audience who really is a part of our family can kind of go with you, support you.
[time=141] So just talk you guys about Josiah Venture and Poland and the way the Bible Hour audience can come alongside.
[time=151] - Well thanks Kelly, we appreciate your kind words and the feeling is mutual and we're serving with you and for this Bible Hour audience has been an absolute joy for 11 years, so.
[time=162] Tanya's gonna tell everybody a little bit about Josiah Venture and then I'll share some specifics about where we're going and what we'll do.
[time=168] - Nice.
[time=169] Josiah Venture works in the post-communist countries of Eastern Europe.
[time=174] They work with the youth in several different ways but they're evangelistic in their approach but they're also very concerned about their growth in Christ.
[time=189] And so they wanna work with the local church and they wanna disciple them and make disciples so that they can like King Josiah and the Bible transform their society.
[time=202] - Yeah, wow.
[time=203] And like Tanya said, they're in several post-communist countries and then specifically they've asked us to launch a program in Poland.
[time=212] That's one of the 12 places they're at.
[time=214] And the program that they want us to launch is called Fusion.
[time=217] Fusion really intersects with our wiring and our gifts and experience.
[time=221] Fusion is a fine arts outreach program that mostly uses music.
[time=227] They have what they call their rock gospel choir and they teach kids how to sing American music that's fun and energetic and they teach them how to play the drums and the piano and the guitars.
[time=238] And so they'll get together at the church building and do rehearsals and prepare for concerts and have a great time together.
[time=245] But in the process of rehearsing and performing, Tanya and I along with the church members that we'll be partnering with, we'll get to share what we believe about Jesus and why we believe it and how it makes a difference in our lives today and how to make a difference and how we spend eternity.
[time=262] And we're praying that that yields a ton of fruit in the lives of teenagers over in Poland.
[time=268] - So I'm clear, I think I am, but I wanna make sure they all hear it.
[time=272] So what you just said means that not only will you guys be working toward this aim, I assume there's gonna be Josiah, venture people in your team who are a part of this, but it sounds also like you're gonna have to partner with that local church.
[time=288] That local church is gonna have to have absolute buy-in on the fusion endeavor.
[time=296] And I think just as I hear you say that, I've known that, but it just reminds me, that's one thing that we should really be praying for is a local body that would see the two of you and your team and this endeavor as that important and that critical that they would really support a rock gospel choir.
[time=316] I just like saying that.
[time=317] Maybe we should just have one here.
[time=320] So anyway, okay, that's good.
[time=323] Real quick back to Josiah Adventure.
[time=325] When was the first time you ever met them, Josiah Adventure, heard about them?
[time=329] - Actually, our first year of marriage, we were sent over there through my workplace, my job.
[time=337] And it was fall of that first year.
[time=340] So, fall of 2003.
[time=342] - And you guys went to a Josiah Adventure conference, if I remember, right?
[time=346] Where they gathered all their people.
[time=348] And I think you were impressed from day one, at the way in which they cared for and nurtured those who were in their organization, which I just, as I think about saying goodbye to you guys, and as I think about our Black Hawk family and a broadcast audience, I just wanna shout it from the mountaintops.
[time=371] We view you, you know, I've viewed you guys for years as co-workers, I've viewed you as peers and friends, in many ways I've viewed you as my own, in some senses.
[time=384] And so it's not like this is an easy deal for me, but what makes it easier is I know that.
[time=390] I know Josiah Adventure cares for their people.
[time=394] Spiritually and physically and emotionally, meridally, family.
[time=400] So I'm grateful.
[time=402] - We're gonna be working in a part of the world where 99% of everyone in our countries doesn't know Jesus or doesn't care about him.
[time=411] And so when we spend time in our communities, we get beat up.
[time=415] And so Josiah Adventure strategically finds points throughout every calendar year to get together and to pray and to learn and to share how we've gotten beat up and pray for each other and it's really good.
[time=430] - Talk about how people could support you and the different ways in which they can support you as they listen to you guys and think about maybe how they could come alongside.
[time=439] - Now since January, we've been in the process of building a prayer team and a giving team.
[time=444] Because of the way things work with missions in Eastern Europe, we are not allowed to earn a dime when we get to Poland.
[time=451] If we do, they'll deport us.
[time=453] So it's a little dramatic and that's just the way it works.
[time=456] So that means we raise all of our financing stateside and we've got a pretty big amount of money to raise because we have so many kids and we're going to a big city.
[time=466] - You do have a lot of kids.
[time=469] So we need to raise about $8,000 in monthly support that would be ongoing for those first two years.
[time=475] - $8,000 a month.
[time=476] - Yeah, $8,000 a month.
[time=478] And so far we've raised a little over $5,000 in monthly ongoing giving, which is great.
[time=485] So we still have that gap of $3,000 and we're really hoping to close that gap by the fall of this year.
[time=491] We'd love to head over in October or November.
[time=494] And we'd love for anybody in the Bible, our audience to just pray and ask God, you know, Lord, do you want me to give $50 a month to the millers, a hundred bucks a month to the millers, five bucks a month to the millers.
[time=507] - That person could do $3,000 and you'd be good.
[time=509] - Hey, if they're out there.
[time=511] - That'd be great.
[time=512] - Pray about it, let us know.
[time=514] And Tanya can tell them about how to do that.
[time=517] - Yeah, if they just go to blackcockministries.org/e- - Our website.
[time=522] - Yes, slash events, slash millers.
[time=528] That'll be on the screen here.
[time=530] - Okay, there'll be a button at the bottom that says give to them.
[time=535] - Join our giving team.
[time=536] Join our prayer team.
[time=538] - Yeah.
[time=538] - You can just click on those buttons.
[time=540] - Gotcha.
[time=541] - That simple, it's not simple.
[time=542] - Yeah.
[time=543] - Love technology.
[time=543] - And if someone out there is not internet savvy, - Yeah.
[time=548] - I happen to be one of them.
[time=549] You can just take up the phone and call the church office.
[time=553] - Call the church, yeah.
[time=554] - Call blackcock.
[time=555] - Yeah, ask about supporting the millers.
[time=558] - Yeah.
[time=559] - And the number for the church office will be on the screen as well.
[time=562] Good.
[time=563] - It's that easy.
[time=564] - That easy.
[time=565] - Anything else they can do.
[time=566] They can pray, they can give.
[time=568] And we're gonna say goodbye to these guys here for a bit this summer.
[time=574] They'll be back at the end of the summer.
[time=575] There's languages to learn.
[time=577] There's orientation and classes to take all kinds of things going on, but we're so grateful for the two of you, for your family.
[time=588] And so grateful for all that God has done in and through you and believe He is going to continue to do in and through you.
[time=595] Here for years at Blackhawk now with a rock gospel choir in Poland.
[time=601] Thousands and thousands of miles away.
[time=604] Grateful for you guys.
[time=605] And thank you for these few minutes.
[time=607] Thank you.
[time=609] - Yep.
[time=624] [MUSIC - 231 seconds]
[time=859] If you believe that this morning, would you say amen?
[time=870] It's a song filled with great promises.
[time=873] Great promises found in the Scriptures about our amazing God who is for us.
[time=878] He is with us.
[time=879] He never leaves us.
[time=881] He never forsakes us.
[time=883] We can continue to sing and worship to God this morning unconvinced more and more.
[time=889] The difference between songs we sing and worship to God is prayer.
[time=896] Prayer makes the difference when we change the lyric on the screen from just being the right tune and the right rhythms to a message from our hearts to the God who made us.
[time=908] It becomes not just a song but worship.
[time=911] Jamie's going to get us started on this next song that begins with words straight from the book of Psalms.
[time=917] And I want you to try your best as we sing them to make them prayers from you to your maker this morning.
[time=931] [MUSIC] Amen, bless the Lord forever [MUSIC] I will trust him at all times [MUSIC] So do we have delivered me from all the feet [MUSIC] And he has sat in my feet upon our ground [MUSIC] I will not be moved [MUSIC] And I'll say of the Lord you are my spirit [MUSIC] My strength, my voice shall deliver my strength [MUSIC] Strong tower, my very blessed door [MUSIC] It's time of you [MUSIC] To whom I am left with you [MUSIC] To whom I am left with you [MUSIC] To whom I am left with you [MUSIC] No one I desire [MUSIC] There is love [MUSIC] I've sung some tune [MUSIC] For the crown [MUSIC] You have made me glad [MUSIC] I'll say of the Lord you are my spirit [MUSIC] To whom my strength, my voice shall deliver my strength [MUSIC] Strong tower, my very present hope [MUSIC] You are my chief [MUSIC] My strength, my strength, my voice shall deliver my strength [MUSIC] Strong tower, my very present hope [MUSIC] And time of you ♪
[time=1128] Jeremiah prayed to God's fame on sovereign board.
[time=1132] You have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm.
[time=1137] Nothing is too hard for you.
[time=1140] The Lord answered Jeremiah.
[time=1143] I am the Lord, the God of all mankind.
[time=1146] Is anything too hard for me?
[time=1149] Then Paul, Paul wrote about Abraham.
[time=1153] Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.
[time=1168] Then Paul wrote to the Thessalonians the one who calls you is faithful and he will do it.
[time=1176] Then Isaiah spoke for God's fame.
[time=1179] So do not fear.
[time=1182] There I am with you.
[time=1184] Do not be dismayed for I am your God.
[time=1188] I will strengthen you and help you.
[time=1190] I will hold you with my right, just right hand.
[time=1206] [MUSIC]
[time=1215] You have made me glad.
[time=1221] And I'll say all thought, oh, you are my shield, my strength,
[time=1233] my portion, do you hear the word?
[time=1239] My shells are strong down, my very friends, and now you are my shield,
[time=1255] my strength, my portion, do you
[time=1263] hear the word?
[time=1265] My shells are strong down, my very friends, and now you are my shield,
[time=1281] my strength, my portion, do you hear the word?
[time=1290] My shells are strong down, my very friends, and now you are my shield,
[time=1320] my friend.
[time=1325] Well if you would, take your Bibles and open them up to 1 John chapter 4, my friends.
[time=1330] I'm so grateful for Steve Longbreak being here with you last week.
[time=1334] So thankful that I got to see most of his message live stream.
[time=1338] We were out in Seattle.
[time=1340] Our entire family got to be together with my mom and my mom's mom, my grandma.
[time=1345] I think you may have seen the picture.
[time=1347] We showed it last week or they showed it.
[time=1349] We celebrated her 100th birthday.
[time=1353] And it was an amazing occasion to be with family and to be with friends and to celebrate a hundred years.
[time=1359] It really was a real encouragement for us.
[time=1363] I'm just grateful for Steve, thankful for those who teach in our family here.
[time=1368] I'm aware of the fact I think most of you are too that we're blessed.
[time=1371] We're blessed to have gifted teachers and gifted communicators.
[time=1375] It doesn't really matter who's up here.
[time=1378] God has allowed at Blackhawk these days for there to be men who are able to do this in a way whereby you get fed and encouraged and instructed in the Word of God.
[time=1386] And I'm grateful that Steve brought us up to this point.
[time=1389] Today we find ourselves in 1 John chapter 4, the best way to avoid false teaching.
[time=1395] The best way to avoid false teaching and a powerful reminder that every Christian needs
[time=1404] to hear again and again and again.
[time=1407] This is where we're going this morning.
[time=1408] Would you in honor of God's word stand and let me read 1 John chapter 4 verses 1 to 4.
[time=1415] Just to remind you again, John, 95 years old at the end of his life, having invested and
[time=1422] having given himself to the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ for all these years.
[time=1428] He's worried.
[time=1429] He's concerned because the church is facing a challenge.
[time=1434] The church in that day was facing a culture that was inundating the church and those in the church with cultural messages, cultural temptations, cultural teaching, cultural sermons
[time=1448] if you will, everywhere they looked they were getting messages that were counter truth that
[time=1456] were anti-Christ.
[time=1460] And it was beginning to happen more and more and more so, sound familiar, and so John writes.
[time=1465] To give the church a foundation on which to stand on again, he writes to kind of remind
[time=1472] them of the things that are really, really true and the stuff that really, really matters.
[time=1478] And so what a joy it's been for us to study this and see this and come to understand these things again.
[time=1484] And we come today to chapter 4 and John continues, beloved.
[time=1488] But do not believe every spirit.
[time=1492] But test the spirits to see whether they are from God because many false prophets have
[time=1498] gone out into the world and what did prophets have, prophets had messages.
[time=1503] And they spoke and there are many, he says, who have gone out into the world.
[time=1508] And so the world has all kinds of messages.
[time=1511] By this you know the spirit of God as you test it.
[time=1515] By this you know the spirit of God, every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.
[time=1524] And every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.
[time=1529] This is the spirit of the anti-Christ.
[time=1532] It is of the anti-Christ when what you have is a message that does not promote, does not celebrate, does not lift up the person and work of Jesus Christ.
[time=1542] This is anti-Christ of which you have heard that it is coming and now it is already in
[time=1549] the world.
[time=1551] But you, verse 4, but you are from God, little children, and have overcome them.
[time=1556] Because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.
[time=1564] Our Father in heaven we ask that you would open our hearts and our eyes and our souls to your life-changing truth this morning we pray.
[time=1572] And everybody agreed and said, amen, you can have a seat.
[time=1575] All right.
[time=1576] So John shifts in his letter if you have been following along, if you have been joining as you know that for a while now for several passages it has been all about love and the
[time=1587] importance of love.
[time=1588] And now John shifts in his theme.
[time=1591] He shifts in his focus from love to the importance of what you believe.
[time=1598] He moves from love, everybody just kind of tap your heart here.
[time=1601] He moves from love to the importance of now tap your head to the mind to what you believe
[time=1608] to be true.
[time=1609] He moves from the visceral to the cognitive.
[time=1613] John knows that everybody, and this is really true church, John knows that everybody ends
[time=1619] up with at some point in time they end up with what they believe to be true.
[time=1626] Everybody ends up with what they believe to be true.
[time=1628] Having heard all the messages that you hear, having heard all the spirits that come your
[time=1634] way, having heard all of the sermons if you will, everybody ends up placing their hope
[time=1642] and faith in someone or something.
[time=1647] This is really true.
[time=1649] And here in the first few verses of chapter 4 John offers believers a surefire way to test
[time=1656] all of these messages, all of these sermons that you're hearing, that you're experiencing,
[time=1663] that are coming your way.
[time=1666] All the messages you're hearing day after day and a culture then that was filled with like ours today, false teaching and false messages, John provides the individuals in the body
[time=1676] of Christ this way of testing.
[time=1680] You see he wanted them to believe the truth.
[time=1686] He wanted them to be able to stand on that which was real.
[time=1690] He wanted them to believe the truth, the truth as presented through the law and the prophets, the truth as presented through the scriptures, the truth as presented through the teachings and example of Jesus.
[time=1701] Remember the Jesus, first John chapter 1 you're going to have to go back a couple of months in our study.
[time=1705] Remember first John chapter 1 the Jesus that John himself had heard.
[time=1710] The Jesus that John himself had seen.
[time=1720] Remember this.
[time=1722] John's 95, John has seen it all.
[time=1725] There isn't a cultural message.
[time=1727] There isn't a spirit that he hasn't encountered.
[time=1730] There isn't a sermon out there that he hadn't heard.
[time=1733] He had been there, he had been with Jesus, he had been in the church, he's 95 years old, he's seen it all.
[time=1742] He knows all the options and he wants his people to believe and know the truth.
[time=1751] And it is without doubt the very same thing, make no mistake that I want for each and every one of you.
[time=1759] I want you to believe, I long for you to know the truth.
[time=1764] I want for you to stand on it.
[time=1766] I want for it to shape your life.
[time=1770] I want you to know, I want you to experience, I want you to realize what your life and your
[time=1776] home and your family and your future can be like because you have placed your faith and
[time=1783] your hope in the truth.
[time=1785] Because what you believe, listen, because what you believe, what you are down deep inside, really placing your faith in, it will define you, it will guide you, it will even control
[time=1799] you.
[time=1800] I read this this week, the consistent actions, listen.
[time=1804] The consistent actions or choices of an individual, the consistent actions or choices of an individual
[time=1812] are not the exception to their belief, but rather bring full exposure to the reality
[time=1819] of their belief.
[time=1821] Did you get that?
[time=1823] Your consistent actions, your consistent choices, they aren't the exception, no, they're the
[time=1829] rule, they reveal what it is you truly and really believe.
[time=1835] And I want for you to believe and know the truth.
[time=1839] I've learned in 25 plus years of ministry to say to myself whenever I bump into the personal
[time=1847] tragedies and heartbreaking scenarios I see again and again and again and all that I get
[time=1856] to be a part of.
[time=1858] I've learned over the years to say not how sad it is that they, he or she did what they did.
[time=1865] I don't say that anymore, I used to.
[time=1868] I don't say how sad it is that they did what they did or that they chose what they chose.
[time=1874] No, now today I say how sad it is that they believed what they believed.
[time=1884] Because that's really what happened.
[time=1888] Because what they believed down deep inside dictated and determined everything they ended
[time=1896] up doing.
[time=1897] And John knew and I know that every one of you here in this room this morning, every one of you watching online will either believe the truth or a lie, a lie that you convinced
[time=1914] yourself was the what, truth, but it wasn't.
[time=1920] It was a lie.
[time=1921] Every one of you in this room this morning will, at one point in time with salvation and redemption
[time=1930] on the line and then on an everyday basis as we live out that choice, every single one
[time=1937] of us every single day we continue to have to make a choice.
[time=1941] Will it be the truth or will it be a lie?
[time=1944] So John says test, test the spirits, test what you are hearing, test what you are seeing,
[time=1954] test what's coming your way.
[time=1956] Right there you saw it in verse one, two and three beloved, don't believe every spirit, don't believe every message, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God.
[time=1965] Because many false prophets have gone out into the world and by this you know the spirit of God, every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ has come into flashes from God.
[time=1977] Every spirit, every message that confesses the truth about Jesus is from God.
[time=1984] And those that don't he says are from anti, they are anti-Christ of which you have heard
[time=1991] that it is coming and now it is already in the world.
[time=1996] John says examine the messages that you are hearing.
[time=1999] Be discerning with the teachings that you expose yourself to.
[time=2004] Be careful with all that you allow into your mind, your heart, your life.
[time=2009] What do you believe?
[time=2010] It is a very important question, but just as important this morning, just as important
[time=2017] what messages, what spirits are you allowing in to shape and construct your beliefs.
[time=2026] So simply and clearly said, we read it right there in those first three verses, simply and clearly said do not embrace, I hope you will write this down, do not embrace any message
[time=2036] or expose your heart, mind and soul to any thinking that diminishes Jesus Christ in any
[time=2043] way as Lord, as King, as fully man and fully God and all the honor and all the respect
[time=2051] and all the obedience that would come with that man who is in that position, do not
[time=2057] embrace any message or expose your heart, mind and soul to any thinking that diminishes
[time=2064] Jesus Christ.
[time=2066] So here is where over half of the room just went.
[time=2071] Here is where about half of you just went in your mind.
[time=2074] You are thinking, okay, thank you, that was a nice little intro, I get where you are going I am fine, half the room just said to yourselves, you are okay because on this front you have
[time=2085] not recently attended any anti-Jesus seminars, have you.
[time=2090] Raise your hand if you have recently attended an anti-Jesus seminar.
[time=2094] Raise your hand if you were on deleting his deity.com last night.
[time=2100] Go ahead, raise your hand, raise your hand if you have checked out a book lately that
[time=2106] teaches you how to renounce Christ.
[time=2110] So see you are all sitting here thinking, man this is really going to be an easy Sunday because it does not really, I am good.
[time=2121] You see you can fall into this thinking that says John is just talking about overt heretical
[time=2130] sermons that all John is really talking about here is, you know, you are fine unless you
[time=2136] let the guys in the white shirts and ties in your door last week and bought all the material and now you are going to their meetings and it is so much more, it is so much more than
[time=2148] that it is that but it is so much more than that, think about it, think about it with
[time=2154] me, he is talking to those in the church just like you who lived in a culture just like
[time=2163] ours, a culture then that produced messages and a mindset just like ours and make no mistake,
[time=2171] he is most definitely talking about the teaching in the church but he is also addressing the
[time=2177] everyday sermons that everyday people hear everywhere they go.
[time=2186] So some things to think about, some things for you to keep in mind and I say you because he said in verse 1, chapter 4 verse 1, he says you, you test didn't he?
[time=2201] He doesn't tell me to do it for you, he says to you today that you as a believer, as someone
[time=2208] who has fully surrendered their heart and life to Christ, he says you are to test, don't
[time=2214] believe every spirit but test the spirits.
[time=2218] So you want to test the spirits well, you want to keep believing what is true, you want to stay on firm foundation, you want to stand solid, here is three things, I want you to write these things down, three things that you and I can give ourselves to practically to help us in our effort as believers to stand and to stay true, number one, make sure what you watch and listen to, write this down, make sure what you watch and listen to is consistent with the character of Christ, interesting, maybe you haven't made that connection in the
[time=2247] past, it's good for you and I to think about this, people have been telling us for years to be careful with what we watch and listen to, I'm just inviting you to think about what you watch and listen to and to compare it not to some parental standard, to not compare
[time=2262] it to some popular social or peer belief, no, take what you're watching and listening
[time=2268] to all of you and compare it to, set it up against the character of Christ because every
[time=2278] message and every spirit that diminishes Christ, John says go the other way, don't do that.
[time=2293] You say okay, I like that, Kelly, when do you think I should practice that, I think you should practice that always, I think you should practice this morning, noon and night, I think
[time=2304] you should practice it every waking moment of your day, everywhere you go, all the time,
[time=2314] make sure what you watch and listen to is consistent with the character of Christ, let
[time=2320] me say this to you on this front, as it relates to life inside these four walls, as it relates
[time=2326] to what you would hear from this stage, as it relates to what you might hear in a Sunday
[time=2332] morning community group or a small home community, listen, as it relates to what you hear here,
[time=2340] your elders, your shepherds, your staff, it has been charged by God through us, we are
[time=2346] to care for you and we are going to be your filter if you will, we're going to make sure
[time=2352] that everything you hear and everything you see here is consistent with the truth that
[time=2359] we know and have committed ourselves to regarding Christ, the minute anything popped up around
[time=2366] here that was inconsistent with him, it would be dealt with swiftly, when you walk out of
[time=2375] this place, while we're still your elders and we still love you and we still want to help you in that endeavor when you walk out of this place, you're the filter, you have
[time=2388] to test the Spirit, you have to test the messages, you're the one who has to stand in the gap
[time=2396] in your relationship with God and as these things come your way, stay true to that which
[time=2402] is right, so make sure you're careful, make sure you're careful, Psalm 1013, I love what
[time=2409] it says, what a powerful truth for any person in this room, I will set no worthless thing,
[time=2417] I want you just to think about that for a moment, I want you to think about your monitor, I
[time=2423] want you to think about your phone, I want you to think about your eyes, I want you to
[time=2431] think about you on the road, I want you to think about you at the mall, I want you to think about you in the quietness of your room, I want you to think about you wherever you are and that which you set before your eyes, and God's Word gives us a great plan on how
[time=2451] to navigate all the above in a way that keeps us anchored to what's true, don't set a single
[time=2459] worthless thing before your eyes, make sure you watch, make sure you're careful, secondly,
[time=2470] write this down, consistently read through the Gospels, in order to see, hear and touch
[time=2478] the heart and mind of Jesus, I've been thinking about this again lately, there have been times in my life where I have done this, there have been too many seasons of my life where I haven't as I have thought about it again this week, it just kind of wells up in me as being this
[time=2495] unbelievably good idea to consistently read through the Gospels, why the Gospels, because
[time=2503] in the Gospels when you read through Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, you get to see the life of who, say it, Jesus, you get to see how he lived, you get to see how he related to his father, you get to see him in crisis, you get to see him with his friends, you get to see him doing ministry, you get to see him when he's alone and you get to see him when he's with crowds, you get to see Jesus in the whole and total of his life and if you consistently
[time=2531] are reading through the Gospels you're consistently getting a picture of Jesus and don't forget
[time=2537] John was so solid, John was so sound, John was so convinced now about what was true because
[time=2544] John in chapter one said, I was with him and I saw him and I heard him and I touched him,
[time=2554] he's real, he was real to John and my point is he can be real to you. The more clearly
[time=2565] write this down, the more clearly you see Christ, the easier it is to follow him. I don't know
[time=2573] that anybody taught me this, I don't know that anybody told me this, it just started doing it. When we had kids, first we had one and then before you knew it we had five and
[time=2583] once I started having these little kids with me when we would go different places, it started with Russell T when he was maybe two years old and it's just been something I've always done, we go into a parking lot, we go into a mall, we go into a ball game, whenever we're in crowded places and dad's going somewhere, I would always just say to them, hey, walk by my leg, I just would say walk by my leg, get right here next to my leg and as I was
[time=2607] walking wherever I was going, I could feel them, I could feel it right now as I say it to you, I could feel them right by my leg and sometimes there was two or three of them by my legs and I could feel the tug on the back of my pants, I could feel that hand hanging
[time=2623] on and no matter where I went, no matter how fast I went, they were there and wherever
[time=2634] I was going they were going because they were hanging on, they were walking right by my legs and you see when you can feel them and when you can see them and when you're with them
[time=2646] you can follow them and I know that there are people in this room this morning and you've
[time=2656] lost sight of him, you can't feel him anymore, you can't touch him, you haven't seen him or
[time=2667] heard him, it feels like in a long, long time, you've been hearing a lot of messages, you've been catching a lot of sermons from culture, a lot of choices have been made and there's this distance that's been created and he would just long for you to saddle up next
[time=2683] to his leg and walk alongside, hang on to the back of his pants and be close, consistently
[time=2693] read through the gospels in order to see here and touch the heart and mind of Jesus.
[time=2699] I say consistently, you know, somebody might say what do you mean by consistently?
[time=2704] I don't know, I don't know that I would prescribe that for you but let me ask you this, how
[time=2710] many sexual messages did you get yesterday?
[time=2716] How many illicit messages came across your path, young and old?
[time=2723] How many inappropriate messages got flashed in front of your eyes in the last 24 hours?
[time=2731] How many messages got put in front of you having to do with greed and materialism and
[time=2738] illicit stuff and the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride
[time=2746] of life?
[time=2747] My point is this, the number of messages that got flashed in front of you and me yesterday,
[time=2753] this time that you begin to compete with that.
[time=2758] And I'm not going to give you a number but what I'm saying to you is it ought to mean enough to me and it ought to mean enough to you.
[time=2764] When I say consistently putting what's true and right and good in front of us, consistently reading through the gospels for instance to see here and touch Jesus, do it enough to
[time=2775] compete with the onslaught of sermons, messages that you're hearing day after day after day
[time=2782] that would love to move you in the absolute opposite direction.
[time=2790] You want to keep believing the truth?
[time=2792] You want to stand on solid ground, you want to test the spirits appropriately, keep, listen,
[time=2798] keep worshiping the Lord, keep being attracted to Christ, keep showing allegiance to Jesus,
[time=2807] keep doing this my friends, there's a point I'm going to make here, listen, keep doing it, do it today, do it tomorrow, do it next week, do it next month and let months turn
[time=2818] into years, keep being faithful.
[time=2823] Why do I say this?
[time=2825] Well, there's strength in faithfulness.
[time=2831] Let me ask, watch this, let me just give you a picture of this, in fact I had Keith up here a couple weeks ago, Keith Moore, Katherine, hi Keith, hi Katherine, they're back there.
[time=2843] Can you guys just stand up just for a second and I'll let you sit back down, just stand up just for a second, this is Keith and Katherine Moore, Keith's on our staff, he's been on our staff for years, hi you guys, they've been in ministry for 65 years, they've been
[time=2857] married for 60 plus years and you guys can sit down, thank them for their faithfulness.
[time=2863] Now I've got a question, Katherine, can you hear me, a little bit, all right, Katherine
[time=2874] I want to ask you a question, are you planning on divorcing Keith next week?
[time=2887] She said she's not going to divorce him but she might do something else.
[time=2891] So let me get this straight, Katherine, you're not going to leave Keith, Katherine, let me
[time=2899] ask you a question, has Keith been difficult at times for you?
[time=2909] Has Keith been frustrating for you at times?
[time=2917] So here's my point, thank you Katherine, and Keith, I hated to throw you under the bus like that but you, listen, listen, listen, she's been married to him for 60 years.
[time=2932] She's been, listen, she's been hearing messages from culture her whole life that would tell
[time=2939] her to do something else, believe me.
[time=2944] She has for years and years and years and years been faithful to the truth, Keith's not perfect
[time=2952] nor is she, their marriage isn't perfect but you know what, it's been 60 years and they're still there.
[time=2958] And she's not going to divorce him, she's not going to leave him, she's not going anywhere.
[time=2968] You don't go anywhere when she chose to love and you can choose to follow.
[time=2978] You can choose to follow the Lord, you've been following the Lord for six months, listen, follow him for a year and then turn that year into five.
[time=2984] You've been following the Lord for 10 years, turn it into 20, get up tomorrow and choose
[time=2990] to do what's right, choose to honor him, let your faithfulness do what faithfulness does
[time=2997] over time, it solidifies you.
[time=3001] You want to test the spirits, you want to stay strong, keep worshiping the Lord, keep
[time=3007] being attracted to Christ, keep showing allegiance to Jesus.
[time=3015] Now, watch this, guess what makes all three of those practical applications I just gave
[time=3024] you.
[time=3025] That's good stuff.
[time=3026] Now, these are good things, make sure you watch what you're listening to, consistently read
[time=3032] through the Gospels, keep worshiping, keep being attracted to Christ, those are good things but guess what makes all three of those endeavors possible?
[time=3041] Your great determined effort, no.
[time=3046] What makes that possible and the only thing that makes that possible is verse four.
[time=3055] Look at verse four, it says, "You are from God, little children, and have overcome them."
[time=3063] All those messages, all those sermons from the world, all those spirits, you've overcome them because greater is he who is in what, say it, you.
[time=3075] Greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world and I want to just allow this
[time=3082] to be, the lights are going to come down a little bit and I want to give you as Corbin makes his way up, I want to just give you a moment here to reflect.
[time=3088] I want to give you a moment to reflect on that great truth because sometimes I think
[time=3094] you lose sight of this, sometimes I think maybe you get a little confused on this.
[time=3101] Greater is he, if you know the Lord Jesus Christ, if you have fully surrendered your heart and life to him, then the Bible is reminding you this morning that in this great battle
[time=3112] of messages and spirits and all that the enemy would want to do in and through you, the word
[time=3119] of God's reminding you this morning that greater is he that is in you, in you, like
[time=3129] right inside of you, really, truly in you.
[time=3136] Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.
[time=3142] All the darkness of the world, all the destruction of the world, all of its seedy, dark, awful,
[time=3152] painful stuff that runs rampant in this world.
[time=3158] You see, sometimes you and I, we get afraid of all of that.
[time=3162] Sometimes you and I have this inferiority complex, we think somehow that's the big, bad bully
[time=3168] and how in the world are we ever going to hang on?
[time=3172] How in the world would we ever succeed?
[time=3174] How in the world could we do those three things I just gave you?
[time=3177] We'll make no mistake, you can't.
[time=3181] But greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.
[time=3189] And not only is he in you, I want to remind you this morning that he's for you.
[time=3194] It's another mistake that you and I too often make, too often times you think he's what?
[time=3200] I think he's against you, you think he's mad at you.
[time=3203] Oh, he loves you.
[time=3205] He loves you deeply.
[time=3208] He loves you purely.
[time=3210] He loves you unconditionally.
[time=3213] And he is the most powerful.
[time=3214] He is the greatest.
[time=3215] He is the awesome.
[time=3216] He is the majestic and mighty God.
[time=3219] And he is greater than he who is in the world and he is in you.
[time=3227] And remember that this morning, hold on to that.
[time=3232] Hold it tightly as Tanya sings, "Be grateful for the way in which he views you and the strength
[time=3238] that it gives you to test the spirits and to move forward in belief and strength."
[time=3259] So fearful, so constant, so alive and so true.
[time=3288] So powerful in all you do, you fill me, you see me, you know me everywhere, you love for
[time=3308] me to seem to you.
[time=3313] I know that you are for me, I know that you are for me, I know that you will never forsake
[time=3328] me in my weakness, I know that you have come now, even if to ride upon my heart.
[time=3341] And tonight, who you are.
[time=3348] So patient, you're so gracious, so merciful and true, so wonderful in all you do.
[time=3378] And you do, you fill me, you see me, you know me every move, you love for me to seem to
[time=3394] you.
[time=3395] Lord, I know that you are for me, I know that you are for me, I know that you are for me,
[time=3406] I know that you will never forsake me in my weakness, I know that you have come now,
[time=3419] even if to ride upon my heart, to remind me, Lord, I know that you are for me, I know that
[time=3435] you are for me, I know that you will never forsake me in my weakness, I know that you
[time=3447] have come now, even if to ride upon my heart, to remind me, who you are.
[time=3469] Lord, I know that you are for me, I know that you are for me, I know that you are for me,
[time=3498] I know that you will never forsake me in my weakness, I know that you have come now,
[time=3511] even if to ride upon my heart, to remind me, who you are.
[time=3541] Lord, I know that you are for me, I know that you are for me, I know that you are for me,
