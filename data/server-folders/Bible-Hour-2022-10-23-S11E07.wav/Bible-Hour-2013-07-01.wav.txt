[time=873] We are your church and we need your power in us.

[time=913] We are your church. We pray be right this earth.
[time=924] Sing us together. No tricking. Build your kingdom here. Let the darkness fear.

[time=962] Unleash your kingdom's power. Reaching the near and far. No force of hell can stop.
[time=973] You're clearly changing hearts. You made us for much more than this. Awake the kingdom seated us.
[time=984] Fill us with the strength and love of Christ. We are your church. We are the hope on earth.

[time=1013] And land. Set your church on fire. When this nation back changed the atmosphere. Build your kingdom here.
[time=1030] We pray.
[time=1060] Build your kingdom here. Let the darkness fear. Show your mighty hand. Heal our streams.
[time=1075] And land. Set your church on fire. When this nation back changed the atmosphere.
[time=1088] Build your kingdom here. We pray.
[time=1104] I told Corbin the first service that perhaps the greatest testimony of his impact in this
[time=1110] place is that my parents who are here for a couple weeks a year will miss him.
[time=1115] So love you, man. Grateful. There is no greater encouragement than to know that somebody is praying for you.
[time=1123] Can I just tell you that? If you ever tell someone that you're praying for them, I promise you it is solid gold to that person.
[time=1132] I got a text message from Todd Larson, first hour that he was watching via live stream with the team over there in India, so that's pretty cool.
[time=1142] Kelly sent me a text last night asking me to read this to you.
[time=1146] As I prepare to preach this morning on the other side of the world, my thoughts go toward my own family and to you, my Blackhawk family, he says.
[time=1158] And a love and gratitude that God has given me for each of you. And then he asked me to read from 1 Thessalonians chapter 1 verses 2 through 4.
[time=1170] We give thanks to God always for all of you constantly mentioning you in our prayers.
[time=1176] Remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love instead fastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1185] We know brothers loved by God that he has chosen you.
[time=1192] Greatful. So you all very soon, Pastor Kelly says.
[time=1197] So grateful to be part of a church that goes. I'm glad that the team is back from Africa.
[time=1205] The team is in India right now. I'm just so grateful that there are feet expressing our faith. Aren't you glad for that too?
[time=1215] I'm so grateful for the example of selfless sacrifice. The Miller family continues to be to us.
[time=1223] I'm just so grateful to be a part of this place. We're meeting 1 John chapter 4 this morning.
[time=1227] Let's go ahead and jump in. If you would, please, 1 John 4.
[time=1231] Last week, Kelly was 1 John 4 1 through 6. And there's a couple of things that he said I wanted to draw to your attention before we jump in this morning.
[time=1239] He said from 1 John that it was important to be discerning.
[time=1246] Having discernment is about testing the spirit. So someone, something is an error or something is true.
[time=1253] You know that by discerning and by keeping in step with the Holy Spirit. That's how you know.
[time=1259] So Kelly talked about things that we do to not involve distance between us and God.
[time=1265] We should walk closely like a kid to his parent. Remember that illustration? On the pant leg. Real real close.
[time=1271] Stick close to me, right? But we do that friends. We do that. We stick close to him because he first loved us.
[time=1282] Look at verse 4 of 1 John 4. Last week he read this and it just jumped off the page at me.
[time=1289] John says little children, you are from God and have overcome them, them being the false teachers who are from the world.
[time=1300] A system which is hostile to God and doesn't love what God loves and doesn't rejoice in what God is doing in Africa, in India, in other places as well.
[time=1311] They are from the world. Therefore they speak from the world and the world listens to them.
[time=1317] And he said before that in verse 4, for he who is in you, the Holy Spirit who is in you is greater than the world.
[time=1328] Do you believe that? It's true whether you believe it or not, but I hope you do believe it.
[time=1333] He is greater and that's how you can stick close to him.
[time=1337] That's how you can pursue obedience because God has already prepared the way for you because you can't do it good enough.
[time=1345] You can't and you don't have to because he has done everything necessary.
[time=1352] We, John says this in verse 6, we are from God.
[time=1357] That's a strong statement. Whoever knows God listens to us.
[time=1362] Whoever is not from God does not listen to us by this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
[time=1370] John is making a very strong statement, dear friends.
[time=1374] He says that based on people's responses to his gospel proclamation, that's how you know if somebody is of the truth or in error.
[time=1383] He attaches his authority to God. He's hitched the wagon in that way.
[time=1387] I thought about 2 Peter, which is left in your Bible. Go to 2 Peter, chapter 3.
[time=1393] These are staggering verses and I was thinking about them all week. Guys, I could not wait to stay before you this morning and preach this message.
[time=1400] I could not wait. I don't have to wait anymore. Here I am. Let's do it.
[time=1404] Verse 14, "Therefore, second Peter, chapter 3, second Peter is after first Peter."
[time=1410] Just keep going.
[time=1412] All right. "Therefore beloved, since you are waiting for these, these being the world's end, God summing up all things in Christ,
[time=1420] be diligent to be found by him without spot or blemish and at peace.
[time=1425] And count the patience of our Lord as salvation." Just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given to him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters.
[time=1439] There are some things in them, Peter says, that are hard to understand.
[time=1444] We can relate, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction as they do the other scriptures.
[time=1458] Ladies and gentlemen, Peter is writing in the mid 60s, probably.
[time=1463] And Peter says that what Paul writes and has written earlier, perhaps even 20 years earlier, is scripture, like Genesis, like the Psalms, like Isaiah.
[time=1473] And Peter believes that in the middle of the first century, does that astound you?
[time=1480] This is not something that was dreamed up at some council in the 400s, in the middle of the first century.
[time=1488] A generation from the appearance of Jesus Christ, friends, what God has said in his word through the apostle Paul was seen by another apostle as scripture.
[time=1499] So John is saying the same thing in 1 John, chapter 4, now go to the right, 1 John 4, where we're going to be this morning.
[time=1505] So John says things like this, we are from God.
[time=1508] And listening to the gospel that John proclaims is the determining factor if you're in error or not.
[time=1514] Like he says at the end of 4 and verse 21, this commandment we have from him.
[time=1521] Whoever loves God must also love his brother, commandment.
[time=1524] So John isn't making suggestions, he isn't offering advice, he isn't writing an advice column, we're from God.
[time=1531] And what he says carries God's authority, that's how we look at the scriptures in this place, friends.
[time=1537] It carries God's authority, it's living, it's active, it's sharp, it's discerning.
[time=1542] This morning you need to hear from God, not from me, from him, this morning, because what he says is true and it will last forever and it endures.
[time=1551] God is greater than your heart, that's what 1 John 3 says, aren't you glad?
[time=1558] Because my flesh and my heart will fail, but not him.
[time=1563] His love never fails, never gives up, never runs out.
[time=1569] Are you grateful for that too?
[time=1571] Are you, I can't hear you.
[time=1573] Good, okay, you're there.
[time=1575] Okay, well there's this, I just want to take a couple steps back, just kidding.
[time=1583] Hey everybody, you guys know what a litmus test is?
[time=1590] Have you ever ever litmus test anybody?
[time=1592] A few of you have, we don't have litmus paper here, so this is something different.
[time=1596] But if we did, it would look like this, so this is Steve Webster, mad scientist, here we go.
[time=1603] These are, they look pretty much the same.
[time=1608] This container has just water in it, this container has some drain-o in it, which is not good for you to drink or to have anywhere near yourself or your mouth or anything like that.
[time=1621] It looks pretty much the same, but the way I can tell the difference is with this stuff, this is an indicator.
[time=1626] And in John 13, Jesus said this, he said, "By this, all men will know that you are my disciples if you, what?
[time=1636] Have love for one another." This is called phenophaline, they'll be supplying tests after the service today.
[time=1644] This is an indicator, it will tell me what's okay and what's not okay, it's the way in.
[time=1651] Let me show you, it's pretty cool.
[time=1655] This phenophaline stuff, the indicator is like a litmus test, it's going to show you what's okay and what's not okay, that's just water, and it tells me that.
[time=1665] But this, dear friends, is not just water, and putting this stuff in is how I know.
[time=1675] It's that indicator, it tells me what's what, and John says in his letter, in his gospel, all the way around, that love is the indicator.
[time=1690] If you love your brother, you know that God's spirit abides within you.
[time=1696] If you don't, then you don't, that's the message.
[time=1700] Chloe Wapis down here, shout out to Chloe Wapis, on Chloe Wapis' Twitter account, it says, "Love God, love others."
[time=1709] This is the whole message of the Christian faith, friends, to this morning in 1 John 4, and so I can't wait to share it with you.
[time=1715] Love is the indicator, love tells us if we are with him or if we abided him or if we don't, and you can't fake it, you can't fake love.
[time=1725] Would you all stand with me this morning?
[time=1728] We're going to read all the way through verse 21.
[time=1730] There's notes in your bulletin.
[time=1732] If you want to follow along, just some thoughts there.
[time=1734] We don't have a lot of time.
[time=1735] I'm not going to hurry, but I'm not going to doddle, either.
[time=1742] Beloved, verse 7, 1 John 4, "Let us love one another, for love is from God."
[time=1748] Can you hear the children's song?
[time=1750] "And whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.
[time=1754] Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.
[time=1760] In this, the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only son into the world, so that we might live through him.
[time=1772] In this is love, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his son to be the propitiation, the atoning sacrifice for our sins.
[time=1785] Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
[time=1791] No one has ever seen God.
[time=1794] If we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us, by this we know that we abide in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his spirit."
[time=1809] Time out for a minute.
[time=1810] In the list of the fruit of the spirit, what's the first one?
[time=1813] Love, as I mentioned it.
[time=1816] Verse 14, "We have seen and testified that the Father has sent his son to be the Savior of the world, whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he and God.
[time=1827] So we have come to know, and to believe the love that God has for us, God is love.
[time=1836] And whoever abides in love abides in God, God abides in him.
[time=1841] By this is love perfected with us, that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is, so also are we in this world.
[time=1851] There is no fear in love.
[time=1854] But perfect love casts out fear.
[time=1857] Fear has to do with punishment.
[time=1859] Whoever fears has not been perfected in love.
[time=1862] We love because he first loved us.
[time=1866] If anyone says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar.
[time=1872] He does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he's not seen.
[time=1878] This commandment we have from him, "Whoever loves God must also love his brother."
[time=1884] May God add his blessing to the reading of his word, you may be seated.
[time=1894] Whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.
[time=1900] That's how you know.
[time=1903] That's the indicator.
[time=1908] There is no greater encouragement than to know that you are prayed for and that you are loved.
[time=1913] And when my wife this morning sent me a text message saying, "We love you." I could run through a brick wall, I could do anything.
[time=1923] I had that much confidence in the light of her love.
[time=1926] My family's love for me.
[time=1928] I've never doubted it.
[time=1932] Do not think DL Moody said this a long time ago.
[time=1936] Do not think that you can do any work for Christ and hope to succeed if you are not impaled by love.
[time=1944] Andrea was impaled by love, talked to her for 30 seconds, you'll find out.
[time=1953] Talked through after the service, Corbett invited you to do it, she'll be out there.
[time=1958] Love.
[time=1961] In your Boltons, some notes, the first Roman numeral there is love perfected.
[time=1967] Love perfected.
[time=1968] I'll define that with you in a little bit because it's important to define it.
[time=1973] John Piper said this about 1 John 4 7.
[time=1976] When John says that love is from God, he doesn't mean it's from him, the way letters are from a mailman.
[time=1983] Or even letters from a friend.
[time=1985] He means that love is from God, the way heat is from fire.
[time=1989] Or the way light is from the sun.
[time=1993] Love belongs to God's nature.
[time=1996] It's woven into what he is.
[time=1998] It's part of what it means to be God.
[time=2002] The sun gives light because it is light, fire gives heat because it is heat.
[time=2007] God loves because he's God.
[time=2010] Search the world over, friends.
[time=2012] You will not find any other God than our God who describes himself in this way.
[time=2018] As love.
[time=2020] Merciful.
[time=2021] Sure.
[time=2022] Vengeful.
[time=2023] Yes.
[time=2026] But not love.
[time=2028] Not love.
[time=2029] Not like this.
[time=2031] Not demonstrated in this way.
[time=2033] You'll never find it anywhere else.
[time=2034] Some of you have been searching your whole lives for that thing.
[time=2037] You climb and you do anything for it.
[time=2038] Love it.
[time=2039] It's right in front of you all the time in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2042] You need never doubt God's love for you, friends.
[time=2045] I know that you do.
[time=2046] I know that you doubt his love for you sometimes because of your circumstances.
[time=2050] I've been there.
[time=2052] I have.
[time=2053] The clouds gather and the rain falls.
[time=2056] Or maybe the fires burn as they are at West tragically these days.
[time=2060] And so circumstances make you doubt.
[time=2063] But I encourage you again with the words of 1 John 3.
[time=2066] That by this we shall know that we are of the truth, verse 19.
[time=2069] And reassure our heart before him.
[time=2071] For ever our heart condemns us.
[time=2073] God doesn't love you.
[time=2078] God is greater than our heart.
[time=2081] Say it with me.
[time=2082] Would you please?
[time=2083] God is greater than our heart.
[time=2085] One more time.
[time=2086] God is greater than our heart.
[time=2088] The world says, listen to your heart.
[time=2091] It tells our kids that in the movies, doesn't it?
[time=2094] Listen to your heart.
[time=2095] Follow your dreams.
[time=2097] Be true to yourself.
[time=2100] If it's supposed to be true to myself, what do I do when I fail?
[time=2103] If I'm true to myself, I'm true to my failure.
[time=2105] What does that even mean?
[time=2108] You can trust him, friends.
[time=2110] You can trust him.
[time=2113] On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand.
[time=2121] You guys there?
[time=2122] Amen?
[time=2123] Okay, good.
[time=2124] Maybe you're...
[time=2125] Okay.
[time=2126] Letter A.
[time=2127] God is love.
[time=2128] Letter A.
[time=2129] God is love.
[time=2130] It doesn't say love is God.
[time=2133] With apologies to George and to Paul and to Ringo.
[time=2137] And to John.
[time=2139] The Beatles.
[time=2140] All you need is love.
[time=2142] No, not really.
[time=2147] All I need is him.
[time=2149] What does love?
[time=2150] What does it even mean to love?
[time=2152] That's an important question, I think.
[time=2154] Love one another.
[time=2155] Great, Steve.
[time=2156] What does that mean?
[time=2157] Well, it means 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=2160] Verse 4.
[time=2161] It's going to be in the screens before you.
[time=2163] You know these verses.
[time=2164] They are important to be reminded of.
[time=2166] When you say you love someone and you don't mean this, then you don't love them.
[time=2172] That's a strong thing for me to say.
[time=2174] I say it with my eyes wide open.
[time=2177] When I say I love my kids, I do every day.
[time=2181] I tell my son I love them every day before he goes to sleep.
[time=2184] And my daughter, I love her every day.
[time=2186] I tell her those things.
[time=2187] If I don't treat her this way, I don't love her.
[time=2190] Because what it says, love is patience and kind.
[time=2195] Love does not envy or boast.
[time=2198] It is not arrogant or rude.
[time=2200] It does not insist on its own way.
[time=2204] It is not irritable or resentful.
[time=2207] It does not rejoice at wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth.
[time=2210] Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things.
[time=2214] Endures all things.
[time=2215] Verse 8 begins with love.
[time=2217] Never ends.
[time=2220] My dad is here today.
[time=2225] He loves a song by George Jones called.
[time=2227] He stopped loving her today.
[time=2229] Do you guys know that song?
[time=2231] What day was that?
[time=2234] The day she died.
[time=2237] Love never ends.
[time=2241] That's what love is.
[time=2243] This is what God has done for us.
[time=2247] God is love.
[time=2249] It's what it means to be God.
[time=2251] It's to be loving.
[time=2252] He cannot be separated from it.
[time=2256] William Barkin said, we're never nearer to God than when we love.
[time=2260] We are never nearer to God than when we love.
[time=2263] It's true.
[time=2264] Because who he is?
[time=2267] The second thing in your outline there, first one is that God has love.
[time=2271] Second is love manifest.
[time=2272] I love this.
[time=2273] Love manifest.
[time=2274] What it says in verse 9.
[time=2277] Love of God was made manifest among us.
[time=2279] It was showed.
[time=2282] You can say, talk is cheap, right?
[time=2285] It's easy to say, I love you, but it's different to actually show that to people, to demonstrate it.
[time=2291] You know that.
[time=2293] You would way rather, way rather have somebody show you love than promise you love and not come through.
[time=2300] Wouldn't you?
[time=2303] By this the love of God has revealed in us, the New English translation says, it's made manifest, revealed, shown, demonstrated.
[time=2310] Romans 5 says this.
[time=2313] Verse 6.
[time=2314] For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
[time=2319] For one was scarcely died for a righteous person, though for a good person, perhaps one would dare even to die.
[time=2324] But God shows his love for us and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=2337] I know that you doubt that God loves you.
[time=2340] I know you do.
[time=2342] You don't know what I've done, Steve.
[time=2344] You don't know what I've said.
[time=2345] You don't know what I've thought.
[time=2346] I don't.
[time=2349] You need never doubt his love for you.
[time=2351] Never.
[time=2353] The cross is the only evidence you need.
[time=2356] It is the greatest demonstration of love the world has ever seen, or ever will see.
[time=2364] C.S. Lewis said this in the way only he can.
[time=2368] Poem.
[time=2373] So this loves as hard as nails, love is nails, blunt, thick, hammered through the medial nerves of one who having made us knew the thing that he had done, seeing with all that is our cross and his.
[time=2397] Love is nails, love is costly, it will cost you to love.
[time=2403] It will cost you, or it's not love.
[time=2406] Shakespeare said love is not love which alters when an alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove.
[time=2414] Oh no, it's never fixed mark.
[time=2417] It looks on tempest and is never shaken.
[time=2420] It's the star to every wandering bark traveler.
[time=2425] It's fixed.
[time=2426] That's what love is.
[time=2427] It never fails.
[time=2428] Shakespeare knew that.
[time=2429] He wrote about it.
[time=2432] God shows his love for us.
[time=2436] Loving us was costly, friends.
[time=2438] Ephesians 3 says that we can know the love of Christ.
[time=2441] It surpasses knowledge.
[time=2445] How high, how wide, how deep, how long are you saying about it?
[time=2450] Wow.
[time=2451] Matthew 5.
[time=2453] Jesus said, you've heard that it was said, you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
[time=2458] But I say to you, love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you.
[time=2462] That's costly.
[time=2467] That you may be sons of your father who is in heaven.
[time=2470] That's how you show your son of your father in heaven.
[time=2473] If you love those who are not lovely, like he loved you, the ungodly Romans 5 said.
[time=2479] While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=2482] I might die for a nice person, for a good person, for a shiny person, but not for someone like me, but God did.
[time=2490] That's why you never have to doubt his love for you, but you never, ever should.
[time=2495] Because God showed up and God did that.
[time=2497] He did it for you.
[time=2500] This is the ball game of the Christian mess.
[time=2502] This is the gospel, friends.
[time=2504] It's on display for all to see.
[time=2506] The gospel is good news.
[time=2508] It's good news that God loves you with a never lasting love, and He will never stop loving
[time=2515] you.
[time=2517] Verse 10, "In this is love, not that we have loved God, but that He loved us, and said
[time=2524] His Son to be the propitiation." Again, the atoning sacrifice for our sins.
[time=2532] Our hearts are fickle.
[time=2535] I chase things all over the place, I'm distracted, distractable, and so are you.
[time=2541] But God, His love is steady and it's fixed, and He knows you and loves you anyway.
[time=2550] God under no illusions about you, yet you aren't pulling a fast one with God, say if He prayers in church and God will overlook all your stuff in the week.
[time=2558] That's not what God is like.
[time=2560] He knows all things.
[time=2562] He loves you, not because you're pretty or good, but because He made you.
[time=2570] That's good news, really good news.
[time=2575] Maybe you've had a father who didn't love you like God, the father loves, so it's hard for you to see a father in that way, I don't know.
[time=2585] Self-sacrificing, steady, constant love.
[time=2588] That's what God is.
[time=2589] God is love.
[time=2591] It's been manifested, it's been shown, demonstrated among us in the person of Jesus.
[time=2595] Psalm 136, we were in the Psalms earlier, let's go back.
[time=2601] It says this, "Give thanks to the Lord for He is good, His steadfast love endures forever."
[time=2607] Every verse in that Psalm ends that way, "His steadfast love endures forever.
[time=2612] Give thanks to the Lord of lords, His love endures forever.
[time=2614] Thanks to the God of gods, His love endures forever, forever means forever.
[time=2623] God's love, A.J.
[time=2624] Gossip said this about the love of God.
[time=2627] God's love is a son that never sets and never sinks.
[time=2632] It is always, always at its full noon day glory, always.
[time=2640] If you're here today, kids, and you have notes, I think you do, the catch of the day is this, love one another.
[time=2647] You know why you can do that?
[time=2649] Kids, parents.
[time=2650] Do you have notes today, kids?
[time=2651] I don't know if you have them or not.
[time=2652] Do you not have them?
[time=2655] Catch the anyway.
[time=2656] You can still catch it.
[time=2657] Here it is.
[time=2658] Love one another.
[time=2659] You can do that because God loved you first, and if He can love me, then you can love your
[time=2665] sister or your brother or your mom or your dad or your teacher.
[time=2668] You can do it.
[time=2669] It doesn't seem like you can, but God's greater than your heart.
[time=2674] God is greater than your heart, aren't you glad?
[time=2681] Second point in your outline is love given.
[time=2683] We had love perfected, fully realized, what the word perfected means, so we come back to it.
[time=2688] We did come back to it.
[time=2689] Love perfected means love fully realized, love seemed for what it is, and now we have
[time=2696] love given, love given.
[time=2701] It's a gift.
[time=2702] It's not earned.
[time=2703] Little A is the gift of the spirit.
[time=2706] The gift of the spirit.
[time=2708] He is a gift.
[time=2711] By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us because He has given us first 13 of His spirit.
[time=2718] The new living says that God has given us His spirit as proof that we live in Him, and He in us.
[time=2725] Ephesians 1 says this in verse 13, "In Him you also, when you heard the word of truth,
[time=2731] the gospel of your salvation and believed in Him, were sealed, past tense, with the promised
[time=2737] Holy Spirit, who was the guarantee." Maybe your translation if you're looking at it in Ephesians 1 says, "The down payment." He's the down payment.
[time=2744] "The guarantee of your inheritance as a child of God is the Holy Spirit who lives within you." Wow.
[time=2753] That was the Holy Spirit's gift and expression of God's love.
[time=2756] Perhaps you're wondering.
[time=2757] I'm glad you asked.
[time=2759] Here's the answer.
[time=2761] In John 14, Jesus promised that after He left, He would send a helper.
[time=2766] He would send a comforter.
[time=2769] So He would never need be alone.
[time=2770] Some of you fear being alone more than anything in the world.
[time=2777] I know that you do.
[time=2782] Ever, ever have to be afraid, the song said, "We're singing it again in just a minute.
[time=2788] Don't worry." Did I want to cup your hands when you sang?
[time=2790] It's just so good.
[time=2792] Love never fails.
[time=2793] It never gives up.
[time=2794] I want to cup my hands sometimes.
[time=2795] You can do it.
[time=2796] You're welcome to do it.
[time=2799] There's no fear in love because fear has to do with punishment, but He took it all for you.
[time=2805] Jesus paid it all, all to Him, I owe.
[time=2810] He had left the crimson stain, He washed it wide as snow.
[time=2813] It's done already, and He gave us the Holy Spirit as a gift, an expression of His love to lead us into truth, to give us discernment when things are not what it should be, to comfort
[time=2825] us, to lead us, to guide us, to teach us.
[time=2829] He's greater is the Holy Spirit within you than the Spirit in the world.
[time=2833] It's a promise.
[time=2836] Romans 8, Holy Spirit, Francis chambered a book called Forgotten God about the Holy Spirit,
[time=2844] which I recommend to you highly.
[time=2846] He is the forgotten member in our church circles sometimes, and I regret that terribly.
[time=2850] Romans 8 verse 9 says this, "You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit.
[time=2855] If in fact, the Spirit of God dwells in you, anyone who does not have a Spirit of Christ doesn't belong to Him." So Holy Spirit is every bit as much the indicator as love, and I think it's no surprise, the first thing listed in the fruit of the Spirit is love.
[time=2871] Love.
[time=2872] Why?
[time=2873] Because God is love.
[time=2874] Do you see this, by the way, in verse 13, watch this, "By this we know that we abide
[time=2880] in Him and He in us because He has given us of His Spirit, and we have seen and testified that the Father has sent His Son to be Savior of the world, Father, Son, Spirit, one God
[time=2891] in three persons.
[time=2893] The word "Trinity" never shows up anywhere in the Bible, but it's everywhere implied or in this case, stated directly.
[time=2900] One God in three persons.
[time=2902] There it is.
[time=2903] Everyone into where do I go?
[time=2905] On the Trinity, that's where you go, but other places too.
[time=2908] See me after if you want.
[time=2911] By this we shall know that we are of the truth first on 3.19 and reassure our heart before Him whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart.
[time=2921] He knows everything.
[time=2922] You don't.
[time=2924] Me the two I.
[time=2926] Romans 8 goes on to say, "Dear friends, that the Holy Spirit bears witness to your spirit that you are His child, and your heart needs reassuring Deaf, because mine does.
[time=2937] Because there's lies told to us.
[time=2939] The enemy whispers lies.
[time=2941] He is a liar." By the way, that's in verse 20, "If anyone says I love God and hates His brother, he's
[time=2950] a liar." That same word is used in the devil in John chapter 8.
[time=2954] The devil is a liar.
[time=2957] And it's satanic, follow me here, it's satanic to say, "You love God and hate people."
[time=2966] People on the other side of the aisle politically.
[time=2969] It's a litmus test, friends.
[time=2974] It's the indicator.
[time=2976] God is greater than your heart.
[time=2979] These are marvelously comforting things to know.
[time=2982] And lastly, I'd say this, as the band comes up on the stage, there's no fear in love.
[time=2988] Letter A was the gift of the spirit, love-given, and letter B is another gift.
[time=2992] There's no fear in love.
[time=2996] I'll leave you with these very familiar words and encourage you with them, because sometimes
[time=3002] things sound, we go into, "Yeah, yeah, yeah" mode, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." Listen to this, John 3.16, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son."
[time=3027] I have one Son.
[time=3031] He's sitting right over there, and there's not much I've given Him for, but whoever believes
[time=3039] in Him should not perish but have eternal life.
[time=3043] For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him.
[time=3051] Whoever believes in Him is not condemned.
[time=3055] Whoever does not believe is condemned already, because He has not believed in the name of
[time=3062] the only Son of God, Heavenly Father, I pray right now.
[time=3066] We prayed more than once this morning that You would give eyes to see and ears to hear.
[time=3072] It's wonderful, good news that You sent Your Son into the world to save sinners.
[time=3079] Love to us.
[time=3080] Gave Himself for us.
[time=3081] God, this is the message.
[time=3082] This is the truth of the gospel.
[time=3085] This is what we proclaim.
[time=3086] I pray that we would sing right now with conviction, because You first loved us.
[time=3095] There is no fear in love.
[time=3096] Perfect love drives out fear.
[time=3098] It banishes it straight away.
[time=3102] God, there is somebody in this room who needed to hear that.
[time=3105] I'm confident of that.
[time=3109] There is a way to know and to not be afraid today, and through the finished work of Jesus
[time=3116] on the cross.
[time=3117] So pray.
[time=3118] You would draw men to yourself, even now, to respond in faith to the great proclamation
[time=3125] of truth that Your Word gives us, that You set Your Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.
[time=3131] There's no greater message than that.
[time=3133] That's the one thing Your love that never fails.
[time=3137] Let's sing it together.
[time=3138] Thank You for the chance to do it, and praise things in Jesus' name, who loved us and gave
[time=3144] Himself for us.
[time=3145] [AMEN - 369 seconds]
