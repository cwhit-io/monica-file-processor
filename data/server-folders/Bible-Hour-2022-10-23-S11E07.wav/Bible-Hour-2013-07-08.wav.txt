[time=143] - Hey, everybody.
[time=149] Hi, this is my friend, Josh.
[time=153] And Josh is going to talk to you about 1 John 5 today, and I can't wait to sit with you and hear from him.
[time=161] Last week, Corbin prayed for me, and I told you last week that when someone tells you that they're praying for you, that's just marvelously encouraging.
[time=169] So Josh, we're all going to pray for you right now.
[time=172] Those of you listening online, wherever you are, those of you here in the room, if you just join with me for the next couple minutes right now and pray for Josh as Josh stands before us and opens the Word of God, it's a sacred thing, guys.
[time=185] It's a precious thing.
[time=187] And I want to pray for him that he is the vessel that I know that he wants to be this morning.
[time=193] So would you pray with me for Josh?
[time=197] Heavenly Father, it is really good to call you that.
[time=200] It's an overwhelming truth that you are our father, that we are your children.
[time=206] God, Josh is your child, and you love him, and you've called him to share from your word to us today.
[time=215] And so I pray as we have been praying for weeks that you would remove distractions, God, from his mind, and that you'd give him the confidence that 1 John 4 talks about and perfect love casting out fear.
[time=228] Fear has to do with punishment, God, your son, Jesus has born all of that.
[time=232] And he said from the cross, it was finished, and we believe that.
[time=235] It's done.
[time=236] We need to believe.
[time=238] Have the faith to believe that what he has done is sufficient.
[time=242] So God, as Josh speaks that to us this morning, would you give ears to hear?
[time=248] Would you buy your spirit?
[time=250] Move in us in a way that you would have us to move.
[time=255] Move in us, and our hearts, our ears, our minds.
[time=259] God, may we be attuned to what you have to say.
[time=262] Thank you so much for Josh, for his friendship, for his faithful service, for his example as a husband and a father to me personally.
[time=269] Thank you so much, God, for this place, and for this time we have to worship you now in Word.
[time=274] God, go before Josh, I pray.
[time=276] Give him your Holy Spirit to speak words of truth, to pray all these things in Jesus' name, with great thanksgiving.
[time=282] [AMEN - 1 seconds] Thanks again.
[time=285] Well, good morning.
[time=291] It's always a joy for me to be with you, and I'm always grateful and thankful for the opportunity to do this with you.
[time=298] Again, I attend here, and when I'm not preaching somewhere else, my family is here, and I'm just really grateful for all that Black Hawk has meant to me and all those who have gone before me as I grew up here and went to the school, kindergarten through 12th grade, and the church every time the doors were open, so it's just a joy for me to be able to serve this way.
[time=323] So if you have your Bibles turned to 1 John 5, as we think about 1 John and just reviewing for just a quick second, the purpose of 1 John, as we look back to that historical context, was there was a lot of confusion in the church at that time about who Jesus is and about what He came to do.
[time=341] And so John, the pastor, sent a letter to assure the believers there to assure them of their salvation, to assure them of their faith, to assure them of who Jesus really is and what He came to do, and that can really be seen in kind of the key verse of 1 John, in chapter 5 verse 13, he says this, "These things I write to you who believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life."
[time=374] And so John is trying again to just assure those that have placed their faith in trust in Christ, that their faith is secure in Him and in what He has done.
[time=386] And so we're going to look at see how verses 1 through 5 fit in that overall context.
[time=390] So let's read it together.
[time=392] And here's what it says in 1 John chapter 5, starting in verse 1.
[time=396] "Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of Him.
[time=405] By this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and obey His commandments.
[time=411] For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments and His commandments are not burdensome.
[time=416] For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world.
[time=420] And this is the victory that has overcome the world, our faith.
[time=424] Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
[time=432] Let's pray.
[time=434] Father, thank you for the truth of your Word.
[time=436] Thank you for the power of your indwelling spirits.
[time=439] And we come this morning and just confess again with Peter
[time=445] that only you have words of eternal life.
[time=449] So we need to hear from you this morning and again we just confidently anticipate the work of your spirit to help us understand these truths, to help us understand God what you meant in putting these verses here
[time=464] in this specific book.
[time=468] So open our eyes that we may see wonderful things from your truth.
[time=472] I need your help, amen.
[time=475] So I found it interesting as I was studying this passage in five verses that there is absolutely no commands in these five verses.
[time=488] There's no things that we are supposed to do.
[time=493] It's not telling us what we're supposed to do instead, the passage is teaching us what is true.
[time=501] And so John, the little A author I call him, and God, the big A author, right, as God is the one who actually wrote this through John,
[time=512] is very purposeful in wanting us to be assured of some things that are true, some realities or some certainties.
[time=522] With this in mind as we move through our passage, we're going to actually look at four realities this morning or four certainties.
[time=529] The last three realities are really just outcomes of the first reality.
[time=535] So the first certainty that we're going to look at this morning as I just kind of give you a road map is this.
[time=541] The first certainty is what God has done for his children.
[time=544] And we'll call it this morning, our good father.
[time=547] The second reality describes how God's children behave, which this morning we'll call it his family way.
[time=556] The third certainty reveals what God's children receive, which we will call his family benefits.
[time=562] And then the last reality that we'll look at describes what God's children believe,
[time=568] which we'll call this morning his family creed.
[time=572] So what God has done, our good father, his family way, his family benefits,
[time=580] and his family creed.
[time=582] So first let's take a look at the first one, our good father or what he has done.
[time=586] It comes to us in the very first part of verse one of chapter five.
[time=590] And it says this, "Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God."
[time=596] And that phrase right there is talking about regeneration, which is just a big word that means that God has caused us to be born again.
[time=605] We were dead in our trespasses and sins, but God has birthed us.
[time=610] God has caused us to be born into his family.
[time=613] We are now his children.
[time=615] He is our father.
[time=617] And this is speaking to the true nature of saving faith.
[time=622] God does it all.
[time=627] Salvation is not based upon anything we have done or ever could do to earn a right standing with God.
[time=635] And I think John's clarity is striking.
[time=638] Our salvation is based solely and completely upon God's initiative to act on our behalf and save us.
[time=646] He does it through the sacrifice of Christ, and he saves us from the wrath which we all deserve because our sin against him.
[time=655] He's caused us to be born again.
[time=658] It's in that little phrase.
[time=660] And I don't want you to miss it because it's the foundation to who we are as believers.
[time=666] It's his action on our behalf to become his children, to be adopted into his family.
[time=674] And so my question as I was thinking about this verse is how does that agree with the rest of 1 John?
[time=679] I mean, when we think about context, and any time I look at Scripture, I was taught that context is king.
[time=685] In other words, it's not about what this specific verse says.
[time=689] It's about what this verse says in conjunction with what the other verses say around it.
[time=695] It's called context.
[time=697] And so what's the context of 1 John does?
[time=699] What I just said about him being, you know, we being born of God, does that fall in line with the rest of 1 John?
[time=705] Well, I think it does is it starts in chapter 1 verse 7 and John says the blood of Jesus, his son cleanses us from all sin.
[time=713] In chapter 2 verse 2, it says that he, Jesus, is the propitiation for our sins.
[time=718] All that is saying is that that word propitiation means that he took the wrath that you and I deserve.
[time=725] In chapter 3, it says, "See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God, and such we are."
[time=732] In chapter 4 it said, "God sent his son into the world so that we might live through him, not through our obedience, not through our loving one another, not through anything that we could ever do, but because of what he has done."
[time=748] And then in chapter 4 verse 14, "The Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world."
[time=757] I think the overarching theme of 1 John isn't that what we do saves us.
[time=763] What it's talking about is that God and what he has done through Christ has saved us.
[time=768] We have been caused to be born again, that's 1 John.
[time=771] Well, how does that fall in line with the rest of, let's say, back up a little bit to the New Testament?
[time=775] The book of Titus, as Paul was writing to Titus, Titus 3 says this,
[time=781] "But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, He saved us."
[time=787] Listen to this phrase, "Not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to His own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Spirit, whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by His Christ, by His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
[time=810] So Paul agrees, right? Do you see that? We're saved not by deeds of righteousness, which we have done, but by His act.
[time=819] Let's just back up to the Old Testament real quick.
[time=823] Zachariah chapter 3 is becoming one of my favorite passages. I have lots of favorite passages.
[time=828] But in Zachariah 3, it's a vision of a throne room of God, and in that vision is God and Satan, as well as Joshua, the high priest.
[time=838] And as we think about this, I find it interesting to understand the backdrop real quick.
[time=844] Remember the high priest of Israel, there was only one high priest.
[time=849] And he went into the holy of holies, into the presence of God only one time every year.
[time=856] And if we had time to go back and look at all the things that the high priest did to prepare himself to go into the holy of holies, we'd be overwhelmed.
[time=867] He went through all the rigor and everything he possibly could do to make sure that he was clean,
[time=874] to make sure that he was right with God, to make sure that he didn't have any sin in his life.
[time=880] I mean, it started for days ahead of time, for him to purify himself, to be able to go into the holy of holies.
[time=887] And listen what this vision says.
[time=889] Verse 1 of Zechariah 3, "Then he showed me Joshua, the high priest, standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.
[time=899] And the Lord said to Satan, "Lord rebuke you, O Satan, the Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you, is not this a brand plucked from the fire.
[time=908] Now Joshua was standing before the angel." Now remember, this is the same Joshua who would have gone through all the rigor and everything to make himself as clean as he possibly could.
[time=918] And he would not have gone into the holy of holies unless he thought he was cleaned up.
[time=922] Verse 3, "Now Joshua was standing before the angel clothed with filthy garments."
[time=930] And the angel said to those who were standing before him, "Remove the filthy garments from him."
[time=937] And to him he said, "Behold, I have taken away your knick, a knickory from you, and I will clothe you with pure vestments."
[time=944] And I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head, so they put a clean turban on his head." And they clothed him with garments, and the angel of the Lord was standing by.
[time=954] Find it so ironic that we can try as hard as we possibly can to clean ourselves up, as hard as the high priest would before going into the holy of holies.
[time=967] And yet we can't do it.
[time=970] We can't be good enough. We can't clean ourselves up.
[time=974] Even if we try, our garments are filthy.
[time=978] We're full of sin, just as Joshua the high priest in the vision before the Lord.
[time=985] So God does it all.
[time=988] It's clear from our passage in chapter 5, from all of 1st John to the Old Testament, God has done it all.
[time=997] He has caused us to be born again.
[time=1000] And the question is this, how does he do it?
[time=1002] You can see in our verse in chapter 5, it says this, that everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God.
[time=1010] Well, he does it through the work of Christ.
[time=1012] That word Christ means Messiah, or Savior, or the coming one.
[time=1016] All the way back to the beginning of time in Genesis chapter 3, when there was this promise of a coming one who would crush the head of Satan.
[time=1025] It's this Messiah that God uses to cause us to be born again.
[time=1030] The promised one who came to earth leaving his father.
[time=1035] The promised one who humbled himself to be born as a needy baby.
[time=1040] The promised one who lived a perfect, unblemished life.
[time=1045] Who said not a word in front of his accusers.
[time=1049] This promised one who went to Calvary as a lamb led to slaughter.
[time=1056] This promised one who sought to forgive those who drove the nails into his hands in his feet.
[time=1062] This promised one who suffered an excruciating death at Calvary.
[time=1068] This promised one who bore the full weight of the wrath of God as he died.
[time=1076] This promised one who rose again on the third day.
[time=1081] The one who secured your place in mind with him in heaven one day.
[time=1087] This is what God has done for you this morning if you're in the family of God.
[time=1098] It's amazing.
[time=1099] Let it sink in for a minute.
[time=1102] Understand this that God is only pleased with you and God is only pleased with me because he's pleased with Jesus.
[time=1112] And now he looks at me through the perfect righteousness of Christ.
[time=1117] Not based upon anything that I could ever do.
[time=1121] Having been born again into his family solely based upon the merits of Christ.
[time=1127] There are now some natural outcomes which flow from our new relation to him, our father.
[time=1134] And these natural outcomes include this.
[time=1137] It's the second, third and fourth of these truths.
[time=1140] How we behave, what we receive and what we believe.
[time=1144] For today, again, I'll say it this way.
[time=1146] Having been adopted into his family, being born again, there are now the second, third and fourth realities.
[time=1151] His family way, his family benefits and his family creed.
[time=1157] Let's take a look at the first of those three.
[time=1162] It's his family way.
[time=1164] As a part of his family, there are ways that we should behave talking about our behavior.
[time=1169] And the reality is that these behaviors are things that we've already addressed in 1 John.
[time=1173] And so we won't spend a ton of time here, but it's important to understand what he's saying here.
[time=1177] The first behavior is that we would love our brothers and sisters.
[time=1181] Look at what it says in verse 1, the end of verse 1.
[time=1185] Everyone who loves the father loves whoever has been born of him.
[time=1192] You see what he's saying there is this.
[time=1194] That the only way that we can truly love our brothers and sisters is because of our commonality in Christ.
[time=1203] We're all the same in our desperate need for him to save us, for him to adopt us.
[time=1212] There's not one of us in this room that has more merit or more worth than anyone else.
[time=1218] We all stand condemned before our Creator.
[time=1223] We have that commonality and purpose together.
[time=1227] We're all in a position of desperation, needing to be saved by him.
[time=1231] Understand this, as you look around the room and as you interact with other believers, understand that there is nothing that defines us more than this truth.
[time=1245] Tim Keller said it this way.
[time=1248] Friendship is only possible when there is a common vision and passion.
[time=1253] Think about what this means for a Christian.
[time=1256] For all believers in Christ, despite enormous differences in class, in temperament, in culture, or race, or sensibility, and even personal history,
[time=1270] there is an underlying commonality that is more powerful than all of those.
[time=1276] Christians have all experienced the grace of God in the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1284] If you're in the family of God today, there is nothing, nothing that you have that is more in common with each other than your commonality in Christ.
[time=1298] And that commonality allows us to love one another.
[time=1302] In other words, your love or commitment to one another has been forged by your new birth and been forged by the new birth of your brothers and sisters in Christ.
[time=1313] Then he moves on in verse two. Furthermore, look at what he says.
[time=1317] "By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey His commandments.
[time=1324] The only way we can truly love our brother in Christ as He moves forward is by first and foremost loving God."
[time=1332] You see, when our eyes are focused on God, that then allows us to not be self-absorbed and self-focused and truly then love one another
[time=1342] because our tendency, my tendency is to love myself.
[time=1348] What's in it for me in this relationship?
[time=1352] It reminds me of Charlotte's web in Templeton. You guys remember the rat, Templeton?
[time=1357] And all the time, he's asking, and if you watch the movie, he goes, "Well, what's in it for me?" You know, they ask him to go do something, get some letter from, you know, the fair to bring it back so they can find a word that Charlotte can put in the web
[time=1371] and all he wants to know, "What's in it for me?" That's just, that's you, that's me. We're Templeton.
[time=1378] We're focused on ourselves, and the only way that we can get that focus off
[time=1384] is when we focus on someone greater and better and purer and richer who is Jesus.
[time=1393] You see, again, when we're loving God, we're no longer focused on ourselves, but our tendency is to think about ourselves
[time=1400] and we think about ourselves according to the law.
[time=1403] We begin to think that we have to perform in order for God to be pleased with us and watch what happens. When we let performance creep into our thought process, we become self-absorbed and self-focused
[time=1414] and what generally happens is this.
[time=1417] We begin competing with our brothers and sisters instead of loving because we think our performance will get us in better with our father.
[time=1427] He's going to love me more because I'm better than you are.
[time=1431] And so somehow I've got to stay a step ahead of you.
[time=1435] When we become self-focused and self-absorbed, we might begin judging our brothers and sisters because it makes us feel better about ourselves.
[time=1443] At least I'm not like so-and-so. At least I didn't do what so-and-so did.
[time=1451] When we take our eyes off of God and focus on ourselves, we may even ultimately begin hating our brothers and sisters,
[time=1459] which is the exact opposite, right, of what He's calling us to do.
[time=1463] When you say, "Josh, hating," it's a strong word, right?
[time=1468] It goes back to the beginning of time.
[time=1472] Cain and Abel and Genesis 4.
[time=1475] John talks about Cain and Abel. Go back two chapters in our very book, First John.
[time=1480] Listen what it says. In verse 11 of chapter 3, "For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another.
[time=1487] We should not be like Cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother.
[time=1491] And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil in his brother's righteous.
[time=1496] Why did he murder him? He was competing. He was jealous.
[time=1501] He wanted to get his brother out of the picture because he was so self-focused.
[time=1509] And so John comes back and says, "Listen, the only way that you can love your brother and sister is if you first love God.
[time=1518] Get your eyes on Him. Offer yourself."
[time=1524] Another area of behavior which naturally flows out of being born of God is our obedience.
[time=1530] So loving our brothers and sisters in Christ's second in this arena is our obedience.
[time=1534] Look at what it says at the end of verse 2.
[time=1536] It says, "When we love God and obey His commandments." And then verse 3, "For this is the love of God that we keep His commandments and His commandments are not burdensome."
[time=1545] Our obedience is based upon the fact that God has made us new creatures in Christ.
[time=1553] Go back again to chapter 3 in verse 9.
[time=1557] He says this, "No one born of God makes a practice of sinning.
[time=1561] For God's seed abides in Him and He cannot keep on sinning because He's been born of God."
[time=1570] The only way that we can really obey is because God has made us new.
[time=1576] If God has not made us new, there is absolutely no way for us to truly obey Him.
[time=1583] But because we're new creatures in Christ, we now have the ability to obey.
[time=1591] And that obedience then not only is it based upon our new creature mentality, but it's based upon our trust that God is good.
[time=1599] He says that His commands are not burdensome, right?
[time=1603] Romans 8.32, it's my favorite verse.
[time=1607] I try to say it every time I'm up here.
[time=1609] What is this? For He who did not spare His own Son but gave Him up for us all.
[time=1614] How will He not also freely give us all things in Him?
[time=1617] In other words, if God went to such an extent to slay His Son to save us,
[time=1623] why would we ever think that He's going to give up on us?
[time=1626] He won't.
[time=1628] He's now for us and within us, not against us anymore.
[time=1633] And so when we look at His commands, we need to look at them and understand that it's His love for us.
[time=1640] Milton Vincent in the Gospel Primer said that those commands are friendly signposts from a heavenly Father who wants nothing else but our best.
[time=1651] God in His graciousness has given us His Word full of His commands so that we would know how life works best here on this earth.
[time=1661] His commands are not burdensome because they're for our good, but also understand this, they're not burdensome because Christ has already
[time=1671] kept them on my behalf and yours.
[time=1676] He's already kept them.
[time=1678] The law has been fulfilled in Him.
[time=1684] Christ has kept them for us.
[time=1686] We obey not because we have to anymore.
[time=1690] We obey because we want to out of gratitude that He has carried this burden for us
[time=1698] and wiped away all of our sin.
[time=1702] So these behaviors, loving our brothers and sisters in Christ and obeying our Father, are both outcomes of an individual who is living every day in the goodness of God through His Son's sacrificial work on the cross.
[time=1716] So we've seen two realities so far.
[time=1718] One, the reality of our good Father, what He has done, He's caused us to be born again.
[time=1722] Secondly, the reality of His family way or how we behave as His new children.
[time=1727] There's a third reality that we'll get to next and that is His family benefits or what we receive.
[time=1733] Look at what it says in verses 4 and 5.
[time=1737] "For everyone who's been born of God overcomes the world, and this is the victory that has overcome the world, our faith.
[time=1743] Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
[time=1750] Overcoming the world is said three times in those two verses.
[time=1755] It's a big deal.
[time=1757] And understand, first of all, the backdrop.
[time=1759] If we went to chapter 5, verse 19, it says this.
[time=1762] We know that we are from God and the whole world, the system that we live in,
[time=1768] the world that we live in, is in the power of the evil one.
[time=1774] The whole world is in the power of the evil one.
[time=1777] But those who have been born into God's family,
[time=1783] it's exactly what it says in verse 4.
[time=1785] "Everyone who's been born of God overcomes the world."
[time=1791] Those who have been born into His family receive the benefit of victory.
[time=1797] Secured, steadfast, now and forever.
[time=1803] Listen to what it says in 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 3.
[time=1806] It says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." According to His great mercy, He has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled,
[time=1826] unfading.
[time=1828] It's not going anywhere.
[time=1830] It's kept in heaven for you who, by God's power, are being guarded through faith for a salvation to be revealed in the last time.
[time=1839] As a child of God, you receive the benefit of victory over the world
[time=1846] and over the world's system.
[time=1848] Notice where this victory lies.
[time=1850] It lies in two places.
[time=1852] First, it lies in our relationship with God.
[time=1854] We already talked about this a little bit, but we did nothing for this.
[time=1858] He's the one that caused us to be born into His family.
[time=1860] And thus, being born into His family, that's where the victory lies.
[time=1864] We receive that benefit.
[time=1867] It's what it says in Romans 6.
[time=1870] You don't have to turn there, but I'll get there in a quick second.
[time=1873] Romans 6 verse 6 says this.
[time=1876] "We know that our old self was crucified with Him." The old self is just talking about our natural flesh that has a propensity to just rebel against God, to do our own thing, to go our own way.
[time=1889] Before God ever entered the world, that's what everyone is like.
[time=1893] We have to deal with this old flesh.
[time=1895] And here's what it says.
[time=1896] We know that our old self was crucified with Him, Jesus, in order that the body of sin or that flesh might be brought to nothing.
[time=1907] Literally in the Greek it means rendered powerless, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.
[time=1917] Because of what God has done for us, our old nature, our old propensity to go our own way and chase after our own things has been rendered powerless,
[time=1928] so that we wouldn't be enslaved to the things of this world and the ways of this world.
[time=1936] You see, we don't have to sin anymore.
[time=1940] We're no longer under the power and control of Satan.
[time=1943] We're free from the burden of the law, the weight that comes with it, the wrath that comes with it, the worry that comes with it, all gone.
[time=1953] Because of Jesus.
[time=1956] So this victory lies first in our relationship with God, but secondly the victory lies in our faith.
[time=1961] Look what it says at the end of verse 4.
[time=1964] And this is the victory that has overcome the world, our faith.
[time=1969] You see, our faith rests in the person and work of Christ.
[time=1974] As John saw Jesus coming to him in chapter 1 verse 29 and he says, "Behold, everyone look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.
[time=1986] Our faith rests in that Lamb.
[time=1990] Our faith rests in him and him alone." You see, the reality of this victory is fixed and final from now throughout eternity.
[time=2002] But listen, the experience of this victory, whether you enjoy the benefits of this victory here and now, is dependent upon the exercise of our faith in the one who has finalized this victory for us, Jesus.
[time=2021] See, John has gone to great lengths in this book to let us understand just the philosophy and strategy of the evil one, right?
[time=2029] Satan.
[time=2031] Satan wants us to believe everything that is the opposite of Christ, everything that is the opposite of his work.
[time=2039] It's what John means when he speaks about the spirit of the Antichrist in chapter 2 and in chapter 4.
[time=2046] It's the spirit of the world and the spirit of the world is such that it's hard to believe the full scope of the work of Christ on a daily basis.
[time=2056] Can I, can this really be true?
[time=2061] This freedom and joy that comes from knowing Christ and knowing that He's delivered me from my sin and the consequences of the sin has nothing to do with me.
[time=2074] And even as I continue every day to rebel against Him, it still is secure based upon the merits of Christ.
[time=2080] That can be true.
[time=2083] Yeah.
[time=2085] Every day.
[time=2090] That's hard to believe sometimes. That's why it says in 1 John 4, 16, says we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us.
[time=2103] We need to believe the love that God has for us.
[time=2107] You see, while God is communicating His truth through the power of His indwelling spirit, Satan is flooding our heart and our minds with conflicting messages.
[time=2119] God's not good.
[time=2123] His commands are antiquated, outdated, restrictive, confining.
[time=2130] His commands aren't for today. That was something for years ago.
[time=2133] Come on, get with the program, right?
[time=2137] While God's community, His truth, Satan is flooding our hearts with messages like Christ was not who He said He was.
[time=2145] Christ's work was not enough.
[time=2148] You need to perform for God.
[time=2151] Satan is flooding your hearts with messages like, "Oh no, you're okay. You're going to be fine. You're good enough." With messages like, "You need to make yourself happy. It's up to you." Go after the things that you think are going to be pleasing to you.
[time=2167] And yet those in the family of God have overcome all of those lies.
[time=2173] When we exercise our faith to put our trust in Jesus, we know that those things aren't true because we believe that Jesus is the Christ. We believe that God is good, that His commands are for our good.
[time=2185] We know that Christ is who He said He was, that He did what He said He did, that our performance is not necessary for our salvation, that there's no condemnation for us.
[time=2196] We've overcome because the Lamb has overcome and His victory is ours forever.
[time=2201] And when we exercise our faith in who He is and what He's done, we experience the joy of this victory here and now and forever.
[time=2210] It's a benefit we receive.
[time=2214] So we've been taught three realities so far.
[time=2216] The reality of our good father, what he's done, the reality of his family or how we behave and the reality of his family benefits, what we receive. The fourth reality or certainty of our passage is this.
[time=2226] It's his family creed or what we believe.
[time=2230] You see, this I believe makes us distinctive from every other religion or organization out there.
[time=2238] Every other religion would say that they have a good father.
[time=2242] Every other religion would say that they have a family way, a set of behaviors to follow.
[time=2248] Every other religion would say that they receive some sort of benefits from their God
[time=2254] and yet no other religion.
[time=2258] Not one has a Savior like ours.
[time=2263] Not one. You can look high and low, go to every organization, every religion.
[time=2268] All of it is going to be based upon your works and your effort.
[time=2272] And Jesus says, no, I've done it all.
[time=2278] No one has a Savior.
[time=2281] No one has a Savior like ours.
[time=2283] There's no other religion or organization in which salvation has already been accomplished for you.
[time=2289] You see, the family creed comes in verses 1 and 5.
[time=2293] It says that we would believe that Jesus is the Christ.
[time=2297] And in verse 5 that we would believe that Jesus is the Son of God.
[time=2301] Those who have been born of God believe these truths.
[time=2305] God's children believe that he is who he said he was.
[time=2309] That he did what he said he would do. That our sins are covered past, present and future.
[time=2315] That there is no condemnation for us.
[time=2318] That God is now within us and not against us.
[time=2322] Kids, the catch of the day today is this.
[time=2325] God's family creed is this. Jesus is the Christ.
[time=2333] The world's creeds are many. I can do this on my own.
[time=2340] I'll do it my own way. I'm my own God.
[time=2343] I have to be better. And yet Christ turns all of these around.
[time=2348] He says, I can't do it, but he has.
[time=2353] I can't find the way, but he is the way.
[time=2356] I don't have to be better because he is better.
[time=2362] Christ and his work is the distinctive element of Christianity.
[time=2368] It's what makes us Christians.
[time=2373] This is the best thing that's ever happened to us.
[time=2376] Listen, the work of Christ isn't good advice.
[time=2381] Advice is when somebody comes and they tells you counsel.
[time=2385] They give you counsel. Here's what you should do.
[time=2389] The gospel is actually good news.
[time=2392] It's telling you what has been done already in Jesus.
[time=2398] No one loves you more or better than Jesus.
[time=2400] No one's done more for you or ever could than Jesus.
[time=2406] Christians, let's embrace our family creed.
[time=2411] Jesus is the Christ.
[time=2417] Well, watch how all this wraps up and relates as we close our time together.
[time=2423] When you are believing the truth about Christ and his work, then your victory over the world is fully realized and your love and gratitude for God grows.
[time=2435] And when your love and gratitude for God grows, you naturally want to obey and you naturally begin loving your brothers and sisters.
[time=2443] The opposite though is true as well.
[time=2446] When you are not believing the truth about Christ and his work, then you are not fully experiencing the victory over the world secured for you and your love for God begins to wane and diminish.
[time=2457] And when your love for God begins to wane and diminish, you don't want to obey.
[time=2462] You start feeling like you have to obey.
[time=2465] You struggle in your love for your brothers and sisters.
[time=2470] And so as you consider your life and as you look every day or every week or when you consider how you're doing, when you see that your life is lacking in obedience or love, realize first of all that that does not mean that you're no longer a child of God.
[time=2486] You're not going to love or obey perfectly or even consistently.
[time=2490] And secondly, know that your victory over the world has already been secured for you as a child of God.
[time=2497] You don't have to do it perfectly or consistently.
[time=2500] Jesus did for you.
[time=2502] He took the weight off your shoulders.
[time=2506] And then third, when you see that your life is lacking in obedience, understand that the remedy is not to try somehow to be better
[time=2518] or do better, but to keep believing and rest every day in the good of the gospel.
[time=2526] The family creed, Jesus is the Christ.
[time=2531] It says something that you've adopted.
[time=2536] Would you rehearse the family creed every day?
[time=2540] I'm going to end with, again, one of my favorite quotes.
[time=2544] It's from a 17th century pastor named Charles Simeon.
[time=2549] He said this, "A complacent Christian is content to simply understand that his salvation is secured by the cross of Christ, but a vibrant Christian loves the cross of Christ, delights in it, glories in it, shutters at the thought of glorying in anything else." And then he says, "Let all of your joys and all of your obedience flow from the contemplation of the cross of Christ." Oh God, thank you for causing us to be born again today.
[time=2585] Thank you for your son that he did it.
[time=2588] Thank you that we're overcomers.
[time=2591] Lord, help us to exercise our faith that we would believe you every day, that our love for you would grow, and as a result of that, the natural obedience and natural love would flow out of our hearts so that we'd give you all the glory and the honor.
[time=2605] Thank you for this wonderful truth this morning. We pray in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=2635] [MUSIC - 581 seconds]
[time=3224] That is worth shouting about, amen.
[time=3226] Let's just make this our prayer.
[time=3228] [MUSIC - 235 seconds]
[time=3468] So now, Church, go on.
[time=3481] [MUSIC - 46 seconds]
