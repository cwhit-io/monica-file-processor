[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Well, hello again, and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=33] It's great to be with you, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
[time=37] It's been a while since I've been here, and I've missed the chance to connect with those of you in our viewing audience, and it's been great to be able to be back here on site after being gone for a couple of weeks.
[time=50] We've been in India, me and others from our team here at Blackhawk, visiting Ralph Bordeaux, and the team of as our own.
[time=57] Many of you know the story of Blackhawk, and as our own, an amazing organization that's rescuing girls out of the trafficking industry in India and other places, giving them hope, giving them a life, giving them a future.
[time=71] Most importantly, giving them Jesus and redemption, and I can't tell you what an amazing life-changing, eye-opening heart-stirring experience it was.
[time=83] And I'm gonna share a little bit about that in today's service, but I just wanna say thank you for your prayers, and I can't wait to see what God has for us, for you, and for those of us here in the Blackhawk family, as we continue to walk alongside as our own in the days to come.
[time=99] Hey, today's message is from 1st John chapter 5, we're winding up in our lengthy, in-depth study of 1st John, and in 1st John 5, as we wind this thing up, we again come to the centrality, the importance, the absolute priority of the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=119] And I wanna just tell you that not only does 1st John end with the importance of Jesus Christ in your life and mine, but the series that we'll begin here shortly after concluding 1st John is a series having to do with Jesus Christ as well.
[time=135] We're entitling the series Jesus according to Jesus, and I know you hear a lot about Jesus.
[time=143] Culture has a lot to say about Jesus.
[time=146] There are those out in society who have opinions about him, there are those who have written books about him, there are those who have made their point regarding the veracity of Jesus and his life and his ministry, everywhere you go, everywhere I travel, people seem to have opinions and thoughts about Jesus and who he really was and what he really did and what he stood for.
[time=170] And you know what we thought it might be good if you could just hear about Jesus according to Jesus, if you could just hear and learn about Jesus based upon what Jesus himself said about himself.
[time=185] And so come for several weeks beginning in August and we're gonna look at the statements that Jesus made in scripture about himself.
[time=193] Jesus said, "I am the light." Jesus said, "I am the bread." Jesus said a number of things that described himself, his ministry, his place, his priority.
[time=205] And I can't wait for you to hear these things and learn from him himself as he teaches us the truth about himself.
[time=212] Thank you so much for being a part of our family.
[time=215] Thanks for tuning in today.
[time=217] I hope you're encouraged.
[time=219] As always, we'd love to hear from you.
[time=221] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=223] God bless, have a great week.
[time=225] [MUSIC - 13 seconds]
[time=241] Say it like they sing it many years ago.
[time=244] [MUSIC - 53 seconds]
[time=315] - Hey, I wanna say this to you as we continue to worship.
[time=319] One of my favorite songs, I got a lot of them, but one of my favorite songs is "Song" by Shane and Shane.
[time=327] And in this song by Shane and Shane, there's this line, and they sing all we have are songs unless you come, unless you come, and they say in this song, "Oh, please Lord, come." In other words, visit our efforts because it's just singing unless you're here.
[time=349] And I wanna just remind us this morning, and it is our prayer and our hope, it has been all week.
[time=356] We want this to be more than a meeting, but it's all that's ever gonna be.
[time=361] It's just gonna be a meeting unless he comes, unless you and I collectively together with hearts open and devoted to him, invite and beg and call for his presence, and then open ourselves to what that will be and look like.
[time=382] It's just a meeting.
[time=384] So let's not have a meeting.
[time=386] Let's do church, amen.
[time=388] And let's invite him to come and be with us.
[time=391] And as he does that, I pray that you'll lift your voice and we can worship him in spirit and in truth.
[time=397] Let's do that.
[time=401] [MUSIC - 52 seconds]
[time=460] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 236 seconds]
[time=709] - Good to see all of you, really.
[time=719] Like I said earlier, you're really good to be home.
[time=721] And again, a huge thanks to many of you.
[time=723] I know who prayed for our days over in India.
[time=727] I've had a few people ask me who I think are a little newer to Black Hawk.
[time=732] Maybe they weren't around this past December.
[time=735] Ask me what the trip to India was really about.
[time=738] I wanna just remind you of the great relationship that God gave us last fall and on into the winter with as our own, as our own is a tremendous organization, ministry there in India.
[time=751] They have headquarters here in Chicago, opening new offices soon in Houston.
[time=756] And they have a tremendous mission.
[time=759] They have this unspeakable privilege of doing ministry in the red light districts of India.
[time=767] They are diving in wholeheartedly to this trafficking situation.
[time=773] It is the sex trafficking industry, a billion dollar industry in India.
[time=780] And we're so grateful that Black Hawk had the chance to get to know as our own.
[time=784] We got to know Ralph, many of you got to hear from him last year, this family in an amazing show of generosity and support gave almost a quarter of a million dollars last December, last Christmas.
[time=799] Our gifts that go, we tried to redeem Christmas.
[time=802] We came at Christmas a different way.
[time=805] And instead of buying gifts, we bought freedom for some young ladies.
[time=809] And we had the privilege of getting to meet some of these young ladies.
[time=813] And we had the privilege of getting to see this ministry on the ground.
[time=819] It really is a sad and dark situation and it is at the same time extremely hopeful and bright.
[time=827] I won't get into great detail this morning.
[time=830] We'll be looking for a time to be with you, I think down in the commons soon during a first hour or maybe even on a Sunday morning in the near future.
[time=839] But I will say this, two homes over there that we got to be a part of.
[time=844] There is the faith home for the little girls.
[time=848] And when I say little girls, let me just say this to you, there's a couple of them right there.
[time=853] Some of the most precious faces you'll ever see, some of the most dear little girls you'll ever meet.
[time=859] The hard reality is this, that there are millions of women being trafficked.
[time=866] There are millions of gals in brothels like the ones we actually were able to tour.
[time=872] And they have babies, that's how that works.
[time=877] Many times, many times, those pregnancies are aborted in back alleys with those gals being back on the line
[time=888] within hours.
[time=890] Sometimes, those babies are born.
[time=894] And those little girls that get born into that setting, 99% of the time, unless something happens, unless there's some level of intervention, 99% of the time, if they live, those little girls become big girls who join their moms on the lines and become trafficked young women, and that is their future.
[time=917] Unless something happens, and what God is doing in the hearts and lives of those as our own, and he's doing it in other settings as well, but we're so grateful we've gotten to meet this team and this ministry.
[time=928] They are figuring out ways to remove these little girls, these younger gals, and bringing them to a place where they get to invest in them.
[time=937] They invest in them physically.
[time=941] They invest in them emotionally.
[time=944] My goodness, you would understand, wouldn't you the emotional investment that they need, the help and encouragement that they need as they begin to grow up now in a healthy setting, now with people who love them, now with those who are treating them, not as orphans anymore, but instead, with Ralph and his team, they're treating these girls as their daughters.
[time=968] They're treating him as if they were their own, and the investment that they're making, and the love and the care they're providing, it's allowing these little girls to grow up and become older girls, and the older girls in the ministry live at a place called Grace Home, and here you see my daughter Wesley, who got to go with me, what a joy that was, what a great experience.
[time=993] Wesley here with some of the 15, 16, 17 year old girls, and as, listen, as dark as the beginnings of these stories are.
[time=1005] And trust me, it's as dark and as hard to fathom as anything I've ever seen.
[time=1010] As hard as it is at the beginning of this story, it is even that much sweeter towards the end as you now see 16, 17, 18 year old girls who because of what's been invested academically and spiritually and personally, these girls are now graduating from high school, and they are on tracks that will lead them to become engineers.
[time=1034] These gals are becoming doctors, these gals are going to seminary, to lead ministries, these gals are computer software engineers, they're civic engineers, these gals have the world in front of them and every opportunity you could imagine.
[time=1050] Their shoulders are back, their heads are held high, and most importantly, Ralph would tell you, they've been set free because rescuing a girl from the brothels is never considered done until those gals come to know Jesus as their Lord and savior and shepherd.
[time=1071] And that's what they're seeing happen again and again and again.
[time=1074] So it is an incredible journey.
[time=1077] I was so grateful to get to have my daughter with me, that's us first, I want the best pictures I've ever taken with my phone, staring into the mirror on the bathroom door at a hotel room in India.
[time=1091] And what a joy, if you ever get a chance to take one of your kids on a trip to go do ministry, do it.
[time=1100] And so thankful that she got to be there, so glad that we got to be in that together, so thankful for the way our team embraced her and I couldn't think of a better way to spend those 11 days than with her.
[time=1115] One thing happened toward the end of our time, I will share this with you on that Saturday when we first arrived in a very calculated, very safe and yet very honest way.
[time=1129] Ralph and a team of as our own folks took us into the red light district.
[time=1136] We didn't see it from a distance, they took us in two, three or four different brothels.
[time=1146] Mid-day, there wasn't any activity going on, but we got to meet gals that they've been establishing relationship with, we got to see it and experience it to a degree.
[time=1161] And again, it was the most disturbing, most difficult thing maybe I've ever witnessed and were it not for the end of the story.
[time=1171] It was an experience that would just truly unravel you, but the hope and the light and the joy of what God is doing from that left us so very encouraged.
[time=1184] While we were there on Saturday, we met two gals.
[time=1189] We met her, 23 year old gal who's been in the industry, 10 years, so you do the math.
[time=1197] And then we met this other gal who's been down in the red light district for about 12 years and we met them on Saturday down in the brothels with their two little ones.
[time=1209] And I want you to know that Ralph asked us then to pray for them, we actually prayed for them Saturday.
[time=1216] He said we're close, we're really close to getting the two little girls.
[time=1221] Understand, I think you do what it means when he says they're close to getting the two little girls, that means the moms are close to giving their daughters away for life.
[time=1230] The moms are close to coming to this point mentally and emotionally where they're ready to come and give their girls away to as our own.
[time=1240] See them sporadically, but entrust them to Ralph and his team to raise for the rest of their life.
[time=1248] So we prayed on the last day of our trip.
[time=1253] We get out of the car, we're going to visit the little girls home one more time.
[time=1259] Ralph hops out of the car, had just been on the cell phone, comes to all of us and says they're here.
[time=1265] And these pictures weren't taken in the brothel, these pictures were taken at the home, the women showed up that day to drop off their little girls and we got to experience it and see it and pray for them and then they left.
[time=1282] And the other little girls embraced them and put their arms around them and the process began of investing in two more that you helped fund because it costs four to $5,000 a year to provide them with everything they need.
[time=1301] And they're not living in the Taj Mahal, but I'm telling you what, they're not starving and they are getting a kind of care and a kind of love and a kind of investment that you would be proud of.
[time=1312] And I hope that we can continue in the days to come, to come alongside and encourage them.
[time=1317] Thank you so much for letting us go.
[time=1319] Thank you for your prayers and your thoughts.
[time=1322] And we did have some fun.
[time=1325] We did stop at the, we did stop at the department store.
[time=1330] We got a parent, now we get to all watch the parent stand up.
[time=1335] (audience laughs) I'm sure they're just trying to figure out like a diaper bag type thing.
[time=1341] I'm sure no one's spitting, screaming, yelling or kicking.
[time=1345] But yeah, we did stop at a department store.
[time=1347] There's Todd Larson, that's your Indian daddy right there.
[time=1352] Got his new outfit, got his new head gear and we had a lot of fun.
[time=1357] It was serious, it was poignant.
[time=1359] It was memorable, but we also had some laughs and we're thankful to be together.
[time=1364] Hey, open your Bibles if you would this morning to first John, chapter five.
[time=1370] I'm gonna ask Rod if you'd come up and I'm gonna ask all of you if you would to just remember quickly here where we've been in this study.
[time=1379] The church is in trouble, it's new, it's growing.
[time=1383] The apostles have planted the church in all kinds of places with all kinds of people.
[time=1389] John is the last man standing.
[time=1392] He's the last of the disciples, the last of the apostles.
[time=1396] He's got this huge investment.
[time=1398] Nosticism and worldly philosophy is starting to make its way in.
[time=1404] John's extremely concerned about this and the whole book has been John coming back at the foundations of the faith, giving them and giving you and me this opportunity to again recalibrate our thinking in terms of what is true and right and good as it relates to the gospel and the church the way God designed it to be.
[time=1428] And so we come to first John, chapter five, verses six to 12, the book is winding up, we'll finish it next Sunday, but read with me, would you stand in honor of God's word and let me read this to you this morning.
[time=1440] It says in verse six, this is the one.
[time=1445] John says, this is the one who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood.
[time=1456] It is the spirit who testifies because the spirit is the truth.
[time=1461] For there are three that testify, the spirit and the water and the blood and the three are in agreement.
[time=1469] If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater.
[time=1474] For the testimony of God, do you see that?
[time=1477] This is the crux of the passage.
[time=1479] For the testimony of God is this, that he has testified concerning his son.
[time=1486] The one who believes in the son of God has the testimony in himself.
[time=1491] The one who does not believe God has made him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his son.
[time=1501] And the testimony of God is this, that God has given us eternal life and this life is in his son.
[time=1509] He who has the son has the what?
[time=1514] Say it church.
[time=1515] He who does not have the son of God does not have the what?
[time=1520] Say it life.
[time=1522] Our father in heaven, our prayer this morning is that you would take these truths, these simple but profound truths and make them real and make them come alive in our hearts and in our minds and in our lives we pray.
[time=1539] And everybody agreed and said, all right, you can be seated.
[time=1542] I asked Rod to come up just for a couple minutes.
[time=1544] Rod, most of you know others, if you might not, Rod Ovid, Carolyn Ovid, founders of Lagos Institute of Biblical Studies housed right here in our facility experienced regionally around the area.
[time=1557] Rod has been on the study of God's word front, one of the biggest influences in my life.
[time=1563] And I love talking with Rod about the things in God's word.
[time=1566] I love hearing Rod and Carolyn teach God's word.
[time=1570] When I read this passage, first thing that jumped off the page to me, I bet if I had you raise your hand, it would be the first thing that jumped off the page to you.
[time=1579] What's going on with the water and the blood?
[time=1582] What's the deal with the water and the blood?
[time=1586] Mr. Ovid, just talk to us for a little bit about where this is coming from and then we're gonna keep going in the passage.
[time=1592] - All right, water and the blood.
[time=1594] Everyone asked, what's that about?
[time=1595] And scholars have tackled that.
[time=1597] But it's interesting, it's sort of a code that John developed because let's take a little context.
[time=1605] What was happening is John is now in his 90s.
[time=1609] This is the end of the first century.
[time=1612] Jesus died in the 30, remember?
[time=1615] 33, all right.
[time=1618] So a long time's been there.
[time=1619] The disciples were running around ministering, but most of them died before the fall of Jerusalem, which was in 70.
[time=1626] Under Nero, Paul and Peter were killed.
[time=1630] And that was like '68, '66.
[time=1633] So it's been a long time, 30, 40 years and things change.
[time=1638] There are all kinds of antichrists coming up.
[time=1641] There's all kinds of people trying to hijack the gospel.
[time=1646] They did it to Paul, now they're doing it to John.
[time=1648] John is an Ephesus, the Las Vegas of the world.
[time=1653] He's an Ephesus and it is horrible.
[time=1656] And these people are coming in with their philosophical minds and they're high thinking and they're trying to corrupt the gospel and he says no.
[time=1666] Now look at this verse.
[time=1667] He wrote as well the gospel of John.
[time=1670] And it's an interesting verse in John 19, 34 and 35.
[time=1675] But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and immediately blood and water came out.
[time=1684] And he who has testified in his testimony is true.
[time=1689] And he knows that he's telling the truth so that you may also believe.
[time=1696] Now, there's that water and blood thing again.
[time=1699] Now, the reason this is so important is that one of the leading Gnostocysts, one of the leading gentlemen that sort of started it all and came against John all the time, his name was Saranthus.
[time=1714] He was about the same age, he was contemporary and he too lived in Ephesus.
[time=1719] And he and John would go back and forth.
[time=1722] Now, let me tell you a little bit about Saranthus.
[time=1725] He thought, number one, that the world was not made by a supreme God.
[time=1731] It couldn't be, it was corrupt.
[time=1733] That some demiurge made this, some sub-God, some insubordinate God made the world.
[time=1740] A holy God couldn't make it.
[time=1742] He said that Jesus was not born of a virgin, but by Joseph and Mary.
[time=1747] He said Christ.
[time=1749] Now, this is important.
[time=1750] He said Christ was just a man and at the baptism, Kelly's gonna be talking about this.
[time=1755] - This is really, this is really big.
[time=1757] - Yeah, this is huge.
[time=1758] At the baptism, that's when Christ came into Jesus, the man, stayed with him through all the miracles
[time=1769] and just before he got on a cross, Christ left him.
[time=1775] So Jesus, the man died alone on the cross.
[time=1779] Now, what does that do for our atonement?
[time=1781] It nullifies our atonement.
[time=1784] There's no atonement without the Son of God on the cross.
[time=1788] That's why John is saying this stuff.
[time=1791] He's saying interestingly, blood and water came out of Jesus.
[time=1796] Well, he's taking Saranthus' thought.
[time=1800] He's saying, okay, Christ was baptized.
[time=1804] That's the water and that's when the Holy Spirit came down.
[time=1809] That's when God opened the heavens and said, you are my son, true.
[time=1814] So there's the water.
[time=1815] The blood signifies Christ's death on the cross.
[time=1820] And by making that little point in the narrative of the crucifixion, he's saying you're wrong, even at the point of his death, there was water in Jesus.
[time=1834] The Spirit was in Jesus.
[time=1836] Kelly will talk about that later.
[time=1838] So what do we do?
[time=1840] We look at this, the water and the blood, it's a code word.
[time=1844] See, time doesn't change reality.
[time=1847] Time doesn't change it, it doesn't change our doctrine.
[time=1851] John is saying I was there, Jesus was real.
[time=1856] He was in his God.
[time=1859] The water and the blood affirmed that Jesus was man.
[time=1863] The Spirit and the resurrection affirms that he was God.
[time=1868] Together they equaled Jesus, get this, Jesus, the Christ.
[time=1873] God with us.
[time=1876] And it's important that you understand, every time Paul and John used the title Jesus Christ, that was intentional.
[time=1884] They did that purposely.
[time=1888] There was an unspoken word there, Jesus article, the Christ.
[time=1893] Every time they said that.
[time=1898] So that's water and the blood.
[time=1901] It's true, he's roads again.
[time=1902] - Absolutely, amen.
[time=1903] Thank you, Rod.
[time=1904] Thank Rod for his help.
[time=1905] (audience applauds) It says, let me give you the rest of this passage
[time=1913] in light of what Rod has shared this morning's passage really in a nutshell, it's about one thing.
[time=1919] It is about God testifying.
[time=1922] God testifying that Jesus is the Christ.
[time=1925] Jesus all man, Jesus all God.
[time=1927] I don't know if you knew that or not.
[time=1929] Did you know that?
[time=1930] Did you understand the etymology of the history of Jesus Christ?
[time=1933] We've been talking about, we've been teaching about Jesus Christ.
[time=1937] We've been saying Jesus Christ for years and years and years.
[time=1941] Understand today, the thought behind its inception, the thought behind its inception was a world where its deity was being questioned, where the idea of a true 100% man, 100% God being was trying to be nullified.
[time=1955] And so Jesus, man, Christ, Savior, brought together to with great power and great intent, clarify the deity of Christ.
[time=1964] What helpful and what meaningful insight.
[time=1967] The passage this morning is about one thing.
[time=1970] It is about God testifying that Jesus is the Christ.
[time=1977] And the testimony, verse 11, and the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.
[time=1989] Verse nine, the testimony of God is this, that He has testified concerning His Son.
[time=1998] This is about God the Father.
[time=1999] Don't miss this.
[time=2002] This is about God the Father.
[time=2006] And God the Spirit.
[time=2008] But this is about the God of the universe.
[time=2012] Giving testimony to the fact that Jesus is the Christ.
[time=2017] This passage is about the God of the Bible going to great lengths to point out, to clarify and to communicate, to make sure that everyone who read this, then and now, understood that Jesus, when it's all said and done, that Jesus is the whole ball game.
[time=2038] That everything centers or everything culminates in, everything is contingent upon your view and your commitment or the lack thereof to this Christ.
[time=2051] Jesus is God, this is God's testimony.
[time=2055] That Jesus is God, Jesus saves, Jesus is everything.
[time=2060] Jesus is central to the redemptive narrative.
[time=2063] The message of God, the testimony of God Himself is that the divine Son of God is Jesus Christ and that He is the only remedy for the sin and consequence of sin that torments all mankind.
[time=2076] God says, Jesus rescues.
[time=2080] This is God's message for you, under oath.
[time=2086] This is God's testimony to you.
[time=2091] And I just don't want you to miss the significance of that this morning because we get this opportunity here in 1 John 5 to have the God of the universe.
[time=2102] See, this isn't the testimony of Paul now.
[time=2105] This isn't the testimony of Peter, though those are good testimonies.
[time=2108] This isn't the testimony of Isaiah.
[time=2111] This isn't the testimony of Ezekiel.
[time=2113] No, in this passage here in our scripture, it is the living God who says to you and who says to me, here is my testimony.
[time=2128] This supreme, truthful, pure, powerful being, our God says to you and to me, you better get this Jesus thing straight.
[time=2138] So here it is.
[time=2143] To the Gnostics, God wants to be clear.
[time=2147] To the church beginning to be affected by a philosophy of their day, God wanted to be clear.
[time=2153] And here in 1 John 5, God's testimony
[time=2159] regarding the divine nature of Jesus comes in two ways.
[time=2163] I hope you'll write these down.
[time=2164] Number one, it comes externally.
[time=2167] Will you write that down?
[time=2168] It comes externally.
[time=2170] In verse six, it says, this is the one who came by water and blood, water and blood.
[time=2178] First of all, the testimony of God regarding Christ and the deity of his nature comes externally.
[time=2184] This verse says that through the water and blood, we see that Jesus was and is the divine son of God.
[time=2189] Water in this case, as Rod mentioned, brings attention to his baptism, which when you stop and think about it was very unique.
[time=2198] Have you stopped and thought about that lately?
[time=2201] Let's do it now.
[time=2202] Think about Jesus being baptized.
[time=2207] Sometimes we kind of just fly right through that.
[time=2212] Jesus got baptized.
[time=2215] Let me ask you, why do we have people?
[time=2218] Why do we encourage you in the room?
[time=2221] Those of you part of the family here, why do we encourage you to get baptized?
[time=2228] Why do folks get baptized?
[time=2230] People get baptized because they've come to faith in Christ.
[time=2235] They've come face to face with the reality of a holy God and the sinful mess of their life.
[time=2244] They've fully surrendered themselves to Christ.
[time=2248] They've entered into a relationship with him and in obedience to the Lord, they want to publicly proclaim and profess the fact that they love and follow him, that they were lost and now they're found and therein.
[time=2264] That's why people get baptized.
[time=2267] So you should be asking then, well, wait a minute, then why did Jesus, what?
[time=2278] Get baptized.
[time=2278] Glad you're asked.
[time=2284] It was a very, it is a very unique picture.
[time=2288] I believe with some very unique and important motivation.
[time=2295] Mark 1, 9 to 11, just a short little two, three verses.
[time=2299] This is where we see it come to fruition.
[time=2302] Mark 1, 9 says, "In those days Jesus came from Nazareth "in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan." Goes on in verse 10 to say immediately coming up out of the water.
[time=2316] He saw the heavens opening and the spirit of God like a dove descending upon him.
[time=2323] And then it says in the last verse and a voice really happened.
[time=2327] This isn't special effects.
[time=2328] It's not a movie.
[time=2329] It's not a myth.
[time=2330] The skies opened up and a voice out of heaven said, "You are my beloved son.
[time=2339] "In you I am well pleased and I promise you nobody "on the bank of that river didn't know who was talking "or what that was communicating.
[time=2351] "The Son of God had arrived and he got baptized." Why?
[time=2358] Here you go, a few things to write down.
[time=2360] Number one, first reason, very unique.
[time=2363] It pictured, it pre-picksured Christ's death
[time=2369] and future resurrection.
[time=2371] The activity of baptism, we've taught you this before, the whole picture of baptism going down under and then coming back up.
[time=2381] It's this pre-look into the future that Jesus gives those in that setting, that day of what he would actually do.
[time=2390] He is in essence saying to them, "You know what?
[time=2393] "The day is gonna come when I'm gonna go under "and I am going to come back up." He and his baptism illustrates for them the very nature of the resurrection.
[time=2402] Secondly, the baptism of Jesus, very unique.
[time=2407] His baptism was also the first time publicly that the Lord identifies with those whose sins, he himself would bear.
[time=2418] He's not being baptized because of his sins, he had none.
[time=2422] He's not being baptized because he needed to be in terms of what we understand baptism to be about.
[time=2429] What he was doing was saying this.
[time=2430] Listen, you all will come and you all will do this to publicly celebrate one day and proclaim the removal of your sin and your commitment to me.
[time=2443] Well, Jesus says, I'm doing this
[time=2449] to show my commitment to you because all that sin that's gonna get removed from you is gonna be put squarely on me in being baptized.
[time=2464] He steps right into this picture of redemption.
[time=2467] He steps right into this picture of what will happen as people come to celebrate the removal of their sin.
[time=2476] Thirdly, his baptism and most importantly to our text this morning, his baptism, the water, was unique because of what happened at the end.
[time=2489] God literally proclaims the deity, the Messiah's ship of Jesus as the heavens part and the voice of God descends, there was no doubt.
[time=2501] And John wants to remind the church and John wants to remind you that there was no doubt and there is no doubt.
[time=2507] God at the point in time where the water comes into play,
[time=2513] God made it clear this is my son.
[time=2516] Hey, just real quick, have you been baptized?
[time=2523] I'm just asking, I wonder, I ask it every once in a while,
[time=2530] I really would encourage you if you've come to faith in Christ to do what God called you to do and to not disobey him, so get baptized and don't rob the family of the joy that is ours when we hear and get to experience your celebration,
[time=2554] your testimony of God's kindness that led you to repentance.
[time=2559] Just thinking about it and studying it this week, it just reminded me, there's a lot of people in the room and maybe you know him, but you haven't actually followed through with that and we would love to help you with that.
[time=2571] We're gonna be doing it at the pool down at Blackhawk, like we said earlier, August 25th, that may be a great chance for you to do that.
[time=2578] The water, God speaks, God's testimony is at the crux of this passage and it's external, it has to do with the water and then it has to do with the blood, just quickly.
[time=2590] This refers to what happened to Jesus on the cross.
[time=2594] Rod mentioned that, real, tangible, touchable blood, but this blood, regardless of what the Gnostics we're trying to communicate, John wants to make sure that people understand this blood was anything but normal.
[time=2611] This blood, his blood washed away sin.
[time=2613] This blood, the blood of Christ, secured forgiveness.
[time=2617] This blood made sinful man pure.
[time=2621] What can wash away my sin, nothing, nothing but the what?
[time=2626] But the blood, the blood is symbolic of his death on the cross when the, listen, when the earth shook.
[time=2635] A lot of guys died on crosses.
[time=2638] A lot of criminals got hung on trees, all right?
[time=2641] That was commonplace.
[time=2643] It wasn't commonplace to see what transpired and to witness what occurred when they hung him on the tree.
[time=2651] Because when they hung him on the tree, just be reminded, look at Matthew 27, when they hung him on the tree, everything just broke loose.
[time=2661] It says in Matthew 2750, and Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.
[time=2668] It was done, it was over.
[time=2671] And behold, at that time, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.
[time=2679] Man didn't tear it.
[time=2682] The veil in temple was torn.
[time=2685] Miracle of miracles from the top to the bottom.
[time=2688] And the earth shook.
[time=2691] There's this massive geographical, large, widespread earthquake.
[time=2696] The earth shakes and it says the rocks were split.
[time=2702] Everything just starts exploding.
[time=2704] Rocks are coming undone.
[time=2707] The earth is shaking.
[time=2708] The veil is ripped.
[time=2710] The tombs were opened.
[time=2711] Sometimes you forget this part.
[time=2713] The tombs were opened at the point of his death.
[time=2717] And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
[time=2721] Sounds like resurrection stuff to me.
[time=2724] And coming out of the tombs, after his resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared too many.
[time=2732] Now, with all that cooking.
[time=2735] Now it says the centurion, the guard, and those who were with him, keeping guard over Jesus.
[time=2741] They're on the cross when they saw the earthquake and all these things that were happening.
[time=2746] They became very frightened, you think?
[time=2749] They became very frightened and said, "Truly, this was the what?" Say it, church, son of God, deity.
[time=2759] God says, this is my testimony.
[time=2762] He is the son of God.
[time=2765] He is Messiah.
[time=2767] He is the God-man.
[time=2768] He is deity.
[time=2769] He is divine.
[time=2770] And our text says in verse seven and eight that
[time=2776] the testimony was not just the water
[time=2782] and not just the blood, but it was the spirit of God.
[time=2784] The spirit of God, the water and the blood.
[time=2787] The testimony of three, it's a reference back to Deuteronomy 17 and Deuteronomy 19 when there is the testimony of three, the issue, the matter, is deemed to be true.
[time=2797] And here it is so very true.
[time=2799] The external testimony of God.
[time=2801] Now, the testimony of God regarding the deity, the divine nature of Christ also comes, our text this morning says it also comes internally.
[time=2812] And I just want you to think about this.
[time=2814] I just want you to chew on this.
[time=2815] It comes internally, first John 5, 10.
[time=2819] First John 5, 10 says the one who believes in the son of God has the testimony, has the testimony refers to the very same testimony that we just were talking about.
[time=2834] This passage is about the testimony of God Almighty and the God of the universe has said this.
[time=2840] And now the text is saying that same testimony, the very same truth about God in verse 10, it says, it says the one who believes in the son of God has the testimony in himself.
[time=2853] Bible says this morning that it's that if you're his,
[time=2861] if you have fully surrendered your heart and life to him, the veracity of this exchange, the truth of this reality while there are objective truths
[time=2875] that make it very clear.
[time=2877] And we should hold on to the water and the blood and all that that represents here in our text that says this morning that it's also just in you.
[time=2885] It's internal, it's subjective.
[time=2890] There is, John says, subjective proof in your spirit.
[time=2896] You know inside of you that he has saved you.
[time=2906] Does that make sense?
[time=2907] There are convictions that you have
[time=2914] that you didn't used to have.
[time=2917] There are desires in you that you didn't used to desire.
[time=2925] You find yourself reading things and listening to stuff.
[time=2930] You never would have read or listened to.
[time=2934] There are not only actions but attitudes in you and it's just different.
[time=2940] Here's the thing, if you're saved this morning, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[time=2948] You know exactly what I'm talking about.
[time=2952] Romans eight, would you just look with me?
[time=2957] The word of God speaks to this very thing.
[time=2961] It says in Romans eight, verse 15.
[time=2965] I want you to see this and embrace this
[time=2971] and understand this.
[time=2972] It says in Romans eight, 15, for you have not received the spirit of slavery, leading to fear again.
[time=2978] I can't help but think about our girls, our friends in India.
[time=2982] You have not received the spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received the spirit of what?
[time=2988] Say it, adoption as sons by which we cry out.
[time=2993] Abba father, the spirit himself testifies with our spirit inside internally that we are children of God.
[time=3004] And if children heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.
[time=3018] I'm gonna ask the band to come on up and I'm gonna ask you just to listen in here for just another minute.
[time=3024] Says in our passage this morning that when you believe in the Son of God, you know in your heart these things to be true.
[time=3036] And if that's you this morning, if you have believed in the Son of God, listen, you haven't then called God a liar.
[time=3046] You've agreed with his testimony.
[time=3048] You haven't rejected what God has testified to.
[time=3053] You have found the witness to be credible and you've fully surrendered your heart and life to trust, honor and follow Jesus.
[time=3063] And now here's the all important implication
[time=3071] of all that we've just said.
[time=3075] The all important implication for maybe some of you in the room this morning is this.
[time=3081] As well as many of you in the room know
[time=3088] because of the spirit of God that resides in you while many of you in the room know that you're his because your convictions are different and your desires have changed and you're moving in completely altered directions from where you were headed.
[time=3106] While many of you in the room know that to be true, there are some in the room and you know that's not true.
[time=3112] You this morning have a subjective internal sense
[time=3118] that you're not his.
[time=3121] That you haven't bowed the knee of your heart to him.
[time=3129] That you haven't fully like really
[time=3135] surrendered all of you to him.
[time=3138] And the word of God comes to you this morning
[time=3144] for these very reasons.
[time=3145] The testimony of God comes to the church there at Ephesus through the pen of John and the testimony of God comes to Blackhawk and those of you in the viewing audience today to make sure that at least you know
[time=3164] you see there were those in this day, there were those around Ephesus in the Gnostic world and they had this saying that they liked.
[time=3175] They said eat, what'd they say?
[time=3178] You know it, eat, drink and be merry.
[time=3183] For tomorrow you may what?
[time=3185] Yeah, you know what that means?
[time=3186] That means do whatever you want.
[time=3190] Just go do whatever you want 'cause it doesn't matter 'cause this stuff John in the church is teaching it's a bunch of lies.
[time=3198] So really it boils down to that.
[time=3201] Are you in or are you out?
[time=3206] You're gonna eat, drink and be merry.
[time=3208] By the way, how's that going for you?
[time=3211] How's that working out?
[time=3212] Where's that leading?
[time=3214] And here today the God of the universe gives testimony under oath and says this is the deal.
[time=3220] Jesus, embrace him, follow him, commit yourself to him.
[time=3225] He's the real deal.
[time=3227] [MUSIC - 212 seconds]
[time=3444] And forever I will wait, have your way, have your way, have your way, have your way, have your way, have your way.
[time=3474] Oh, she'll stand on the open mind. Oh, I'm yours in your mind. Oh, I'm yours in your mind.
[time=3503] Oh, here I stand on the open mind. Oh, I'm yours in your mind.
[time=3528] Jesus.
