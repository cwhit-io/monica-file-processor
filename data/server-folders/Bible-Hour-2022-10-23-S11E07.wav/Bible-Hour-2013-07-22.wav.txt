[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=29] - Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=31] It's great to be with you thankful for these few minutes.
[time=34] And as you watch this more than likely it's August 4th Sunday morning.
[time=38] And that means we're into August and there's a couple of things I wanna make sure that you know about.
[time=44] Number one, you're not too late for this year's Global Leadership Summit.
[time=48] For 10 years, Black Hawk has been a host satellite site for Willow Creek's Global Leadership Summit.
[time=54] It is a world-class world premiere event.
[time=58] Some of the most unbelievable leaders, some of the greatest communicators you've ever heard, some of the most meaningful messages and talks you'll ever encounter are gonna take place on August 8th and 9th, Thursday and Friday.
[time=72] We're moving our venue from Black Hawk Ministries Worship Center down to the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=79] We're taking it downtown.
[time=80] Numbers, registrations are up.
[time=83] Almost double what they were last year.
[time=85] We're so excited for the ministry and corporate sponsors that we have this year, people who are really committed.
[time=93] Not only the leadership, but the kingdom.
[time=95] And we can't wait for you to join us.
[time=98] If you haven't registered, please call the church or go online at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=103] You can even walk up that day and be a part of it.
[time=107] We're expecting close to a thousand people and Bill Hybels and Colin Powell and Mark Burnett and Henry Cloud and Patrick Lencioni and Andy Stanley.
[time=119] It's an amazing lineup of speakers and I can't wait to be a part of it.
[time=124] We can't wait hopefully to have you be a part of it with us.
[time=127] So don't forget about the summit, Thursday and Friday, August 8th and 9th.
[time=132] Secondly, I wanna make sure you know that we're starting a new series this morning and I'm excited about this series for a number of reasons, not the least of which is this.
[time=142] Everywhere you go, so many people that you talk to, in the media today, in the entertainment culture, in the locker room at the club, wherever you are, there are going to be people who have an opinion about Jesus, that's right.
[time=160] We hear it everywhere we go.
[time=161] There are these so-called experts.
[time=163] There are these bloggers.
[time=165] There are these individuals out there who have their opinions and their beliefs and their thoughts about who Jesus was and what Jesus did or who he wasn't and what he didn't do.
[time=177] Here's the thing, we're gonna take a number of weeks here in August and we are going to do a series called Jesus, according to Jesus.
[time=186] We're gonna let the man speak for himself.
[time=188] We're gonna let Jesus in his own words, in his own thoughts, in his own descriptions, we're gonna go to the Word of God and allow Jesus to define and Jesus to describe Jesus, who was he, what was he like, what did he do?
[time=202] He called himself the bread of life.
[time=204] He called himself the light of the world.
[time=207] There are these descriptive phrases in the Bible where Jesus says, hey, you wanna know who I am, you wanna know what I'm like, you wanna know what I do, here you have it.
[time=215] So join us Sunday mornings in August for Jesus, according to Jesus, can't wait to see what we're gonna learn and how we're gonna be challenged and encouraged.
[time=225] Hey, thank you for being part of our family.
[time=227] Thank you for tuning in this morning.
[time=229] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=231] God bless.
[time=232] There will be, I'm convinced of it
[time=241] because I've already experienced a few of these, there will be a handful of occasions when I will say to my five kids, you better never forget this.
[time=258] There will be a handful of occasions.
[time=260] And again, I've already had a couple of these and I anticipate there being a few more when I will look them in the eye and I will say, if you are going to know anything at all in your life, oh, how I hope you know this.
[time=274] What I'm about to tell you, I'll look at him and I'll say, what I'm about to tell you is a life changer.
[time=284] It's a set the course for the rest of your life issue.
[time=289] This nugget I'm about to give you is that important.
[time=294] Russell, Wesley, Madison, Jake, Evie.
[time=297] I'll tell him, I'll beg him, I'll do everything I can to communicate this to them.
[time=302] Know this.
[time=305] And then we'll talk about this.
[time=308] And this is about right now, this is about three or four different things that I've come to realize are absolutely that important.
[time=319] But there will be days still when I know and I anticipate looking at them and saying to them because I love you so much because you mean as much to me as you do.
[time=333] I hope that you'll understand and know this.
[time=339] And my friends, this morning, this is exactly what the apostle John is doing as he ends his first of three letters to the young, growing, but endangered church that he loved and cared so deeply about.
[time=353] Earlier in chapter one, we saw him refer to them as his dear children.
[time=358] He called them his little children, his beloved ones.
[time=362] And all through our study of this book, week after week passage after passage, we have seen this father's heart for these spiritual children that he loved so deeply and so dearly.
[time=376] And now he comes to the end of this letter in chapter five, verse 13.
[time=382] And he says this, I love it.
[time=384] He says, "These things I have written." He refers now to the entire book, the entire letter.
[time=390] He says, "These things I have written to you who believe "in the name of the Son of God so that you may," what, say it, church?
[time=399] No.
[time=401] I want you to stop right there.
[time=403] He writes these things, he says, so that they may say it again.
[time=409] No.
[time=411] Now this word, no.
[time=412] There's a lot of different words John could have used in the Greek, and I only tell you about the Greek when the Greek matters, right?
[time=418] Well, the Greek matters here.
[time=420] Different words he could have used for no, but inspired by God, John uses the word Oida.
[time=428] O-I-D-A, Oida.
[time=430] The word Oida is a fascinating and important word.
[time=434] It represents a knowledge, yes, but the knowledge of Oida is a knowledge that brings deep clarity.
[time=441] I hope you'll write this down.
[time=442] Oida is a knowledge that brings deep clarity to one's heart and soul.
[time=449] It not only brings deep clarity, it brings deep conviction.
[time=453] It is a knowledge which brings this truth deep and central to the heart of a person, and they develop not only this intimate and clear and knowledge of it, there's this conviction that comes with it.
[time=467] There is this commitment that comes with it.
[time=469] Oida, deep clarity, deep conviction, deep commitment.
[time=475] You see, when you Oida something, or when you Oida someone, you know beyond a shadow of a doubt, you're that convinced.
[time=487] It's that clear, the conviction runs that deep.
[time=491] You know that you know that you know.
[time=495] And he says, I write these things so that you may, what, say it, church, know.
[time=502] And we've talked about this before.
[time=505] These are his last words.
[time=508] He's 95 years old.
[time=510] This is about it.
[time=511] This is the last chance he's gonna get to say the things that matter most to the people that mattered most to him.
[time=518] And we've noted before, and I'll note it again this morning.
[time=521] He doesn't say build something.
[time=524] He doesn't say change something.
[time=529] He doesn't even say do something.
[time=533] No, no, no, no.
[time=535] He doesn't call them necessarily to action.
[time=539] He calls them specifically instead to knowledge because he wants them to know.
[time=549] He wants them to know so that you may know.
[time=554] What's the big deal?
[time=557] You gotta ask, you should be thinking, so what's the big deal about knowing?
[time=564] Because it's what you know, I'll answer that for you, because it's what you know.
[time=571] 16, 17, 18 year old, 20, 30, 40 year old.
[time=576] Anybody in this room thinking about or interested
[time=582] in walking down this road, this road of life and relationship with God.
[time=586] Listen, because it's what you know.
[time=589] It's what you really believe that most affects the choices, the actions, the direction, the future of your life.
[time=597] I'll say it again.
[time=598] It's what you know, Oida.
[time=601] It's what you really believe down deep inside, that most affects the choices, the actions, the direction, the future of your life.
[time=610] Here's what I mean, just an example or two for you.
[time=614] Follow me here, if you really believe, if you know, if you believe deep down that your own natural abilities will be enough to get you through, so you really don't need heightened levels of self-discipline and tedious, vigilant work put in on your weaknesses.
[time=632] I mean, if you know that you'll be great, just kind of cruising through life on talent alone, you'll be like everyone else who's ever thought that same thing, an absolute underachieving nobody.
[time=648] A frustrated, empty failure.
[time=652] Because that's not true.
[time=657] You can't get by on talent alone, can you?
[time=662] Amen?
[time=664] If you know, listen, listen, if you know, Oida, if you believe deep down that pleasure should come before hard work, if you believe deep down that character isn't a prerequisite for success, if you believe lying will get you where you wanna go, if you believe, if you Oida, if you know that cutting corners is commendable as long as you achieve your goal, if this is what rests, if this is what resides at the core of kind of what you believe and what you function from, you'll crash and burn.
[time=694] You see, it matters.
[time=698] What you know, what you believe, what you hold to be true, it really matters.
[time=706] Because what you know, here it is.
[time=707] Because what you know, you do.
[time=712] That's how that works.
[time=715] What you function with in terms of a belief system, what you believe to be true, what you know is what you do.
[time=724] And if you know and believe the wrong stuff, you'll do the wrong stuff and pay for it the rest of your life.
[time=729] You're sitting in this morning and you're thinking, I've been doing the wrong things for a long time.
[time=734] You know what?
[time=735] I understand you want to address your actions.
[time=737] I'm telling you this morning, it's not your actions, it's what you believe.
[time=741] Your belief system needs help.
[time=743] Your knowledge needs help.
[time=745] Because what you know and believe to be true, you do.
[time=749] So I want to help convince you.
[time=752] I want to help build into you a knowledge, John says, that can actually make a difference.
[time=759] You see, John knew the stakes were eternally high for his spiritual kids.
[time=764] He knew everything was on the line.
[time=765] And so he says, you better know this.
[time=769] In fact, in fact, he actually says, you better know these five scriptural truths.
[time=774] These five biblical realities, if you're going to live out your faith in a powerful God honoring difference making fashion.
[time=785] Is that what you want?
[time=787] I hope it's what you want.
[time=788] I hope you're here today wanting to make a difference.
[time=792] I hope you're here today wanting to live in the power of what God has given you.
[time=796] John says, my little children, if you're going to do this, five foundations, five fundamental, absolutely, you have to know these things, truths, from first John this morning as we conclude our study.
[time=813] First John's five foundations, let's start with number one, the assurance of eternal life.
[time=818] We can just read the end of verse 13, these things I've written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have, say it, church, eternal life, eternal life.
[time=832] We have seen in our study, chapter after chapter, verse after verse, reminding us that the marks of genuine faith are obedience, are obedience and genuine love.
[time=845] Love for God and love for each other.
[time=847] We've seen it chapter one, chapter two, chapter three, chapter four, the marks of a genuine believer, the presence of love and obedience.
[time=858] Love for God and others and obedience to God.
[time=861] These are the marks of the truly saved and the truly saved are led to eternal life.
[time=868] That's how that works.
[time=869] If you have fully surrendered your heart and life to him, first John has said to you again and again, you possess, you have, you will experience eternal life.
[time=880] Now it's interesting, John, the apostle John writes, first John, the apostle John also wrote the gospel of John.
[time=888] You know, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.
[time=891] The gospel of John, if you go back and read the gospel of John, John wrote his gospel to bring unbelievers to faith.
[time=899] Anybody who takes time to read the gospel of John, it's as clear as the day is long.
[time=904] It is a gospel, it is a presentation of the life-changing, eternity-altering relationship that those far from God can have with the Son of God because of the sacrifice of Christ.
[time=920] It's an amazing book and it is all about bringing unbelievers to faith.
[time=925] John, John, the gospel of John, chapter 20 gives just a real clear indication of what its purpose was.
[time=932] It says in John 20, 30, "Therefore, many other signs, Jesus also performed in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book." But then verse 31 says, "But these have been written so that you, the reader, may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, you may have what?
[time=956] Life in His name." Gospel of John written for unbelievers.
[time=962] He wrote this epistle.
[time=963] He wrote first John to give believers to help the already-convinced test themselves and examine their faith in order to give them the appropriate confidence that they did, in fact, possess eternal life.
[time=978] You can say it this way.
[time=979] He wrote the gospel to offer faith.
[time=982] He writes his letter, first John, to clarify what true faith is.
[time=986] And here's an interesting insight.
[time=989] I think just worth mentioning and it's worth you and I thinking about, while eternal life, I say that phrase, you think what?
[time=997] I say eternal life, you think years, you think forever.
[time=1002] I say eternal life, we go to kind of the duration of that in our minds, and while the phrase eternal life certainly does have implication to time frames and how long we will live, and you will make no mistake, most of you know this, right?
[time=1019] You will live forever.
[time=1022] There's gonna be a, there is gonna be a moment when the heart stops and the brain fades for some of us that's happening slowly, but there will be a moment true when it ends,
[time=1037] but then from that moment on, you understand, you will live forever, eternal life.
[time=1045] Yes, this phrase does have implication on time frames, but what this phrase here in 1 John 5, 13 really, really is about, isn't time frames, it's about Jesus.
[time=1056] Eternal life is Jesus.
[time=1061] Look at verse 20, we'll skip ahead just real quick and we know verse 20, 1 John 5, and we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true, and we are in Him who is true in His Son, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, this is the true God and, say it, church, eternal life, eternal life.
[time=1087] Eternal life is about a bunch of years, yes, but eternal life is mostly about the fact that you're going to spend all those years with the Son of God.
[time=1098] Eternal life is about an eternal relationship with Christ.
[time=1102] First thing John wants you to know, to deepen your heart and soul is that you as a believer possess eternal life.
[time=1109] Number two, God answers prayer.
[time=1112] God answers prayer, look at verses 14 and 15, this is the confidence, John says.
[time=1117] This is the confidence which we have before Him that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us, and if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask according to His will, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him.
[time=1140] Couple things I want to point out here, I hope you'll just take this in and allow God to use it to encourage you and grow you.
[time=1147] First of all, what a great truth we see there in verse 15.
[time=1152] What a great encouraging truth there in verse 15.
[time=1156] And if we know that He, what?
[time=1159] If we know that He hears us, as it relates to your prayers, as it relates to the prayer experience of the believer, we're reminded today in verse 15 that the God of the universe, the God of the world, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, when you pray when I pray, it says beyond a shadow of a doubt that God hears you.
[time=1183] He hears you, He's listening to you.
[time=1187] I hope that's encouraging.
[time=1189] I really hope it's encouraging and it gets us, and it gets us thinking about this, and I want to ask you this, I asked them first hour.
[time=1196] What's the goal of prayer?
[time=1206] Why is it that you pray?
[time=1210] Go ahead and chew on it, and I don't care if you answer out loud, that's fine, but I want you to think about this.
[time=1217] I really want you to think for a moment here.
[time=1218] Why do you pray?
[time=1222] What is it that should be at the core of your intent as you morning, noon, night, whenever it might be, come before God?
[time=1233] Why are you praying?
[time=1236] What's the goal of prayer?
[time=1240] That through times of personal, honest, faithful, communication with God, your prayers would be answered your way?
[time=1248] Is that the goal of prayer, or is the goal of prayer that your communion with God would be enriched?
[time=1258] Is the goal of prayer that your relationship with Him would be deepened?
[time=1262] What's the goal of prayer?
[time=1264] That you would communicate honestly with God, and as he hears you communicating honestly with Him and bringing the requests of your heart before Him, that He would grant you those?
[time=1275] Or is the goal of prayer a deepened intimacy with Him, a deepened understanding of Him, a deepened knowledge of Him?
[time=1285] See, I think it's the latter.
[time=1290] I really think it's the latter.
[time=1292] I really don't think from what the Bible says about prayer.
[time=1295] I really don't think it's about your list or mine.
[time=1300] I really believe foundationally, prayer is a chance for you and I to deepen and enrich and broaden this relationship that He's called us into, and when you bring to Him the desires of your heart, and when we pray according to His will, and when we hold nothing back, our praise or our confusion, I believe there is in that this opportunity for what you and I have with Him to be enriched.
[time=1329] And listen, when it says that He hears us, if the goal is intimacy, that's the payday right there.
[time=1340] We don't even have to talk about answers.
[time=1343] He hears you, He hears you.
[time=1347] I think about conflict between couples.
[time=1350] I think how many times I've heard I wish He or She would just hear me.
[time=1355] They don't even want to know answers.
[time=1358] They don't even want to get fixed.
[time=1359] They just want to know that someone's listening.
[time=1363] And I'm here to tell you, John is here to remind you today, you've got to know this.
[time=1368] He hears you.
[time=1369] Now here's the second thing.
[time=1372] Don't miss this.
[time=1373] What a great reminder that if we pray according to His will.
[time=1379] Do you do that?
[time=1380] Do you, do you pray all your prayers?
[time=1386] Are they according to His will?
[time=1388] Jesus modeled it for us in the Lord's prayer.
[time=1391] We see it in a number of different passages.
[time=1394] Do you pray?
[time=1395] It's a reminder that we are to pray according to His will.
[time=1399] And we know He hears us.
[time=1402] Then watch this.
[time=1404] Watch this.
[time=1405] If we pray according to His will, then we do get what we prayed for.
[time=1415] Because if what we prayed for is that whatever's done would be according to His will.
[time=1420] And if His will is always what gets done, then He answered your, I'm not playing word games here.
[time=1427] I'm just helping you understand the perspective.
[time=1430] Your prayers, my friends, if you pray according to His will, get answered.
[time=1436] They get answered.
[time=1441] John 14, 13, the Gospel of John.
[time=1445] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, look there real quick, if you will.
[time=1448] John 14, 13.
[time=1450] I loved what I found here in my notes in my own Bible.
[time=1453] As I was reading through this this week, it says in John 14, 13, whatever you ask in my name, that will I do.
[time=1460] Are you kidding me?
[time=1461] It sounds like a genie.
[time=1462] Some people think, you know, that wasn't really me talking there, sorry.
[time=1467] Whatever you ask in my name, that I will do so that the Father may be glorified in the Son and then you read in these notes, it's great, it's a great reminder.
[time=1474] It says to ask in Jesus' name or to ask according to His will does not mean to tax such an expression onto the end of your prayer as a mere formula with hopes of getting what you want.
[time=1485] It means this, it means number one, the believer's prayer should be for the Lord's purposes and God's kingdom and not selfish reasons.
[time=1493] Number two, the believer's prayer should be on the basis of His merits, the Lord's merits, not any personal merit or worthiness of our own.
[time=1502] And number three, it says the believer's prayer should be in and always should be in pursuit of God's glory and God's will alone.
[time=1512] This is praying in the will of God.
[time=1515] Robert Murray McShane, Steve Webster showed me this this morning, Robert Murray McShane said in prayer, God will either give you what you ask or something far better.
[time=1528] Amen, that's a great truth.
[time=1531] In prayer, God will always give you what you ask for or something far better.
[time=1537] Proof, truth is it's well documented in the word of God and in your life and mind that we don't always get our requests, do we?
[time=1549] Raise your hand this morning if you've prayed from the bottom of your heart for something that you believed with all of your heart was God's will.
[time=1557] You knew it aligned with, you felt it, you sensed it, you felt like you could see it.
[time=1562] You knew it was what God wanted and He didn't give it to you.
[time=1565] Raise your hand if you've experienced that.
[time=1568] Of course you have, so have I.
[time=1570] Others get the job instead of you.
[time=1575] Loved ones die way too early.
[time=1578] The sickness gets worse or the relationship gets more challenging, but we know this.
[time=1584] We know that we as believers have this great benefit, we have this great value, we have this great gift of knowing that when we pray according to the will of God, what we get is the will of God and the will of our good and gracious God is right.
[time=1600] It's right, today it's right, it might not make sense for 20 years, it may make sense in six months, but making sense to us isn't the prerequisite.
[time=1613] It's His will and we are to pray according to it.
[time=1615] And John reminds us that our prayers are answered.
[time=1619] Thirdly, we've been given victory over sin and Satan.
[time=1622] I hope you'll write this down.
[time=1623] John wants his readers and I want you to understand this, that you have been given victory over sin and Satan.
[time=1630] Know this my friends, you have more power because of what God has accomplished.
[time=1634] You have more power in you to do what's right than Satan has to lead you into what's wrong.
[time=1642] Verse 18, we know that no one who was born of God's sins, there's a head scratcher, I know, challenging in the English to understand that, no one who was born of God's sins, but he who was born of God keeps him.
[time=1658] The Lord keeps us and the evil one does not touch us.
[time=1663] What's this saying, what this is saying is what we've said to you before in recent weeks, I'll hit it quickly this morning, but it's worth just communicating again.
[time=1672] No one who is born of God has to keep recklessly, habitually, continually, consistently sinning.
[time=1680] The child of God, through the spirit of God, with the guidance of the word of God and the help of the people of God has the power, has power over the pull of sin, has power over the presence of sin.
[time=1693] You might get dinged up, you might get roughed up a little.
[time=1699] There may be a battle, Satan, while having to function.
[time=1702] Think about Job, Satan, while having to function within the sovereign parameters of that which God allows, may cause some temptation, there may be some struggle, it might get really messy, it could get real dicey.
[time=1716] He may get a little closer to you than you'd prefer, it may feel at times like he's right in your grill, but the fact is he cannot do anything beyond what God has providentially or sovereignly allowed, and at the end of the day, if you are his, if you are God's, he'll keep you, and he has given you the power, and he has given you the capacity to face that temptation, to face that difficulty, to face the schemes of the evil one with great confidence and great strength.
[time=1748] And praise God that when you don't, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sin and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[time=1760] John 10, the gospel of John.
[time=1767] John 10, 27, 28, 29, just read this this morning
[time=1773] and just find great encouragement in this.
[time=1775] John 10, John said, "My sheep, this is Jesus talking, "my sheep hear my voice and I know them, "and they follow me, John 10, 28, "and I give eternal life to them, "and they will never perish, "and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
[time=1794] "My father, who has given them to me is greater than all, "and no one is able to mess with you.
[time=1803] "No one is able to snatch them out of the father's hand." We have been given victory over sin and Satan.
[time=1815] I want you to look at this this morning, just quickly here, one other way.
[time=1820] I want you to look with me, would you please look at Romans chapter six?
[time=1825] Would you look at Romans chapter six?
[time=1827] Go to Romans 6, 15, and I wanna remind you as it relates to your relationship with sin.
[time=1835] I wanna remind you that God has sovereignly, God has powerfully, God has absolutely changed.
[time=1842] He has altered your identity.
[time=1845] I wanna make sure this morning that you hear this, you are no longer who you were.
[time=1850] I wanna make sure this morning that you know this, what you used to be, you are no longer.
[time=1855] Your identity, who you are, who you really, truly are, has been changed.
[time=1862] And sometimes the absence of that knowledge, sometimes the absence of realizing that hurts us in our relationship and our battle with sin.
[time=1873] What's it say there in verse 15?
[time=1876] It says, "What then?
[time=1877] "Shall we sin because we are not under law, "but under grace, just because now they're saying, "Okay, well, if grace reigns, "if God's unmerited favor is always gonna be there, "then why don't I just do whatever I wanna do, "whenever I wanna do it?
[time=1894] "Why can't sin abound and grace trump at the end?" He says, "Never, may it never be." You can't live that way because it's not you.
[time=1903] Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin resulting in death or of obedience resulting in righteousness, verse 17.
[time=1920] But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, and many of you in the room this morning, many of you watching online, you remember what it was like to be a slave to sin.
[time=1933] Though you were slaves to sin, you became obedient.
[time=1938] You got saved.
[time=1939] You fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ.
[time=1942] You became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed.
[time=1946] And having been in that transformation, having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness.
[time=1956] Your identity got changed.
[time=1958] You're no longer a slave to the dark side.
[time=1961] Now you are a slave to God.
[time=1964] It's who you are.
[time=1965] He changed your DNA.
[time=1967] He completely transformed you.
[time=1970] And having been freed from sin, verse 18, you became slaves of righteousness.
[time=1976] I'm speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh for just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness.
[time=1988] So now present your members as slaves to righteousness resulting in sanctification.
[time=1995] But now, verse 22, having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit resulting in sanctification and the outcome eternal life.
[time=2011] When God, just hear me here.
[time=2015] When God graciously saved you, know this.
[time=2019] God changed your identity.
[time=2022] You are, some of you are still trying to be, some of you are still trying to be righteous.
[time=2030] When the good news of the gospel is that you already are.
[time=2034] You are righteous.
[time=2037] It's what Christ did.
[time=2041] It's what Christ gave you.
[time=2043] When we say you're in Christ, you're not just sort of in Christ.
[time=2047] You're not halfway in Christ.
[time=2049] No, you're a righteous slave of God.
[time=2054] No longer tied or bound to slavery.
[time=2059] Connected to and joined to sin.
[time=2061] It's a, you know what, here let me give it to you this way.
[time=2064] I don't think I've ever seen this more powerfully illustrated or experienced than what I saw in India a couple of weeks ago.
[time=2073] I saw, I saw little girls living
[time=2080] in the most godless, dark, evil thing I've ever seen or witnessed in my life.
[time=2087] I walked in and through for about an hour and a half, a series of buildings called brothels that represented the darkest, most evil, most awful,
[time=2103] difficult to even describe reality I've ever seen.
[time=2107] And there's these little girls living right in the midst of it.
[time=2112] Probably some of them just a few years away from being thrust into it.
[time=2117] And I saw them rescued.
[time=2120] I saw these little girls who had been removed from that.
[time=2124] They had been saved, bear with me.
[time=2128] They had been transformed out of that place into a different place where they were loved and cared for, where they were given the word of God, where they were given the love of God, where they were given compassion and grace and kindness and discipline, and to watch what happened to them.
[time=2145] As God granted that, I showed you a picture last week of Wesley and some of the older girls who had experienced all of this.
[time=2153] I don't know if we have that picture or not.
[time=2155] There, that picture right there, let me just tell you that those older girls don't view themselves as brothel girls.
[time=2165] They no longer view themselves as being enslaved to the darkest, hopeless reality you could ever imagine.
[time=2173] They don't even think about it.
[time=2175] And they're on their way to becoming chemical engineers.
[time=2179] They're on their way to becoming doctors.
[time=2183] It's how they think, it's how they live, it's how they function because their identity got changed because Ralph and Azar own from the day they got them refused to call them orphans anymore.
[time=2195] They called them daughters.
[time=2198] And when your identity gets changed, you get changed.
[time=2203] And when you understand who you are, and I'm helping you see this morning that John's helping you understand who you are in Christ, everything, everything changes.
[time=2214] You have the power and you have the capacity to live differently.
[time=2218] Amen?
[time=2219] The genuine Christian also, next point, we gotta close.
[time=2222] The genuine Christian belongs to God.
[time=2230] We know that we are of God and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one, but we know we are of God.
[time=2240] You see what this verse is saying is that with a new identity comes new ownership.
[time=2245] The genuine Christian belongs to God, property of possession of God.
[time=2252] Hope you don't mind being possession.
[time=2254] Hope you don't mind being property of.
[time=2256] You are his subject to the rule and reign of our heavenly Father.
[time=2263] Truth is there are only two types of people in the world.
[time=2266] Did you know this?
[time=2268] There are only two types of people in the world.
[time=2271] Ultimately, at the end of the day, just two kinds, children of God or children of Satan.
[time=2276] Sound harsh, maybe, but I promise you it's not.
[time=2281] It's just true.
[time=2283] A person is either fully surrendered to and deeply devoted to honoring and obeying God, or they're surrendered to and devoted to following the world's system and its philosophy, which is governed and led by the evil one at different degrees in different ways.
[time=2297] It just says it as clear as day and we've seen it played out as clear as day from the very beginning.
[time=2303] You are his.
[time=2307] John wants you to know this.
[time=2310] It's important that you know this.
[time=2312] You'll need to know this as you go through life.
[time=2315] You belong to God.
[time=2317] You have a lot of people in this room with issues related to belonging.
[time=2322] I've talked to so many people over the years.
[time=2326] They just want so desperately to belong to something to someone and what a great truth.
[time=2333] The gospel just unpacks this forest in ways hard to even describe.
[time=2338] You belong to God.
[time=2340] You are his.
[time=2342] When is the band makes their way up?
[time=2343] Let me just give you this last one.
[time=2345] Jesus Christ is God.
[time=2347] Kids, I hope you've been following along on your notes.
[time=2351] Adults, the truth is that this entire epistle has been leading chapter by chapter, page by page to the culminating reality that our faith is real.
[time=2363] Our faith is genuine.
[time=2365] Jesus Christ, John 14, 6, he said, "I am the way, the truth and the life.
[time=2372] No man comes to the Father but by me." That's not a proud and arrogant statement.
[time=2378] It's the most loving thing he ever said.
[time=2380] Jesus is God.
[time=2382] There is no one else like him.
[time=2384] He is divine.
[time=2385] The deity of Christ is true.
[time=2387] It says right there in verse 20, it says, "And we know that the Son of God has come." You see that?
[time=2393] And we know that the Son of God has come.
[time=2396] My friends, Christmas, Bethlehem, Virgin Birth, Shepherds, angels, it's all true.
[time=2402] He came.
[time=2403] He really did.
[time=2404] And has given us understanding so that we may know him.
[time=2409] Look at this.
[time=2410] He has given you and I, every bit of understanding and insight that we could ever need or want so that we will know that he is true.
[time=2419] And we are in him.
[time=2420] Verse 20 continues, "And we are in him." We have been adopted into.
[time=2425] We have been, Paul says in Romans 9, we have been grafted into.
[time=2430] Whoever you were, you are no longer.
[time=2432] Now you are in him.
[time=2434] Identity changed, name changed, reality changed, eternity changed.
[time=2440] We are in him.
[time=2443] Son of God has come.
[time=2445] It's given us every opportunity for understanding.
[time=2448] We are in him who is true and this is true.
[time=2452] Second to last line, this is true, God.
[time=2455] This is the true God and eternal life.
[time=2458] Jesus is exactly that.
[time=2461] He is our eternal life because he is God.
[time=2466] Let me just leave you with this.
[time=2470] I skipped over a couple verses regarding the sin that leads to death.
[time=2475] It's a lot of discussion about what that is.
[time=2477] There's a lot of controversy in some settings as to what that really means.
[time=2482] I don't really see it as controversial.
[time=2484] I don't see it as all that confusing.
[time=2488] There is one sin that is unforgivable.
[time=2493] And the one sin that is unforgivable, there will be no forgiveness for this sin.
[time=2499] And that is the sin of rejecting the very one who John just spent five chapters lifting up as the Christ.
[time=2508] If you reject him, if you turn your back on him, if you wanna eat, drink, and be merry and roll your dice, okay?
[time=2519] But Jesus is God and salvation is experienced through him and it is a rich and joyful and life changing experience and the only sin that's ever not forgiven is the rejection of the one who God sent to give you life.
[time=2534] So, would you stand and would you just lift your voices
[time=2540] and your hearts?
[time=2541] Would you use this time as a chance to just say to God how grateful you are?
[time=2546] Let him hear your heart, let him hear your voices and let's worship him together.
