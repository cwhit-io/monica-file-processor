[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=29] - Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=31] It's great to have you with us.
[time=32] We're grateful for each and every one of you and thankful for these moments that we get to share together each week.
[time=39] I wanna talk to you this morning about two very interesting opportunities, two special opportunities that we have for you on the educational front.
[time=48] And by education, I mean this.
[time=50] First of all, Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=54] Black Hawk Christian School has been one of the most significant, most meaningful ministries of Black Hawk Church for over 40 years.
[time=61] It is a school that continues to not only invest academics at a very high level in two students and even their families.
[time=70] It also invests the love of Christ, the truth of God's word and a wonderful solid worldview.
[time=77] And I am so grateful for our school.
[time=79] So thankful for Linda Pearson and her staff.
[time=83] Linda is our lead administrator and I'm grateful for what we see God doing there.
[time=87] You might wanna call or you might wanna come by as you think about your little ones, as you think about their future, as you think about the kind of investment that you wanna make in them academically and spiritually, you might really wanna come by and take a tour, ask some questions and let us share with you our vision of Christian education and the chance that we hope to have with families just like yours and the days to come as we continue to invest in hundreds and hundreds of families from all over our region.
[time=117] Also for you adults, we have a thing that we have just grown to love.
[time=122] It is a great opportunity called Lagos Institute of Biblical Studies and on Wednesday nights, here at Black Hawk, you can look it up online.
[time=130] On Wednesday nights at six and 730, Lagos is teaching college, Bible college level, almost seminary level, Bible classes for people just like you, $5 a night.
[time=142] That's it, and it is Rod and Carolyn Ovid at their best.
[time=146] And I would encourage you to look up Lagos Institute of Biblical Studies online.
[time=152] You can go to Black Hawk's website and learn more about it, but it is a great chance for you to learn more about scripture and not just learn, but learn and understand it so that you and I can apply it in the everyday of life.
[time=165] Lagos, Wednesday nights here at Black Hawk, I hope you'll check it out.
[time=169] Hey, thanks so much for tuning in.
[time=171] Thanks for being a part of our family.
[time=173] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=175] (upbeat music)
[time=283] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[time=301] Join in, my soul's secure.
[time=303] (upbeat music)
[time=346] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[time=359] (upbeat music)
[time=376] Our study of 1 John has made that very clear, Christ is preeminent, Christ is sufficient, Christ is at the very center of everything, that the redemptive message from God is about.
[time=389] He really matters, and what you do with him is really, really important.
[time=394] You know, the mission, the purpose of the church is made very clear in Matthew 28, any church that cares about a biblical mission has been given one.
[time=407] It says there in Matthew 28, Jesus said, as he's getting ready to depart, he says go, church, go.
[time=414] Don't sit, don't stay, don't huddle, go.
[time=417] And make disciples.
[time=420] Jesus said that the entire existence of the church and our ministry is to make people, grow people, engage people so that they can become more like who, say it, church, Christ.
[time=435] More like Jesus, Jesus.
[time=438] Here at Blackhawk, the way we say it, in our unique setting here, we're trying to do what Paul said in Colossians 128.
[time=446] We're trying with all of our effort, with all of our might, with all of our resources, we're trying to see people completed in Christ.
[time=456] We believe completed, mature, grown-up, moms and dads and businessmen and students.
[time=468] We believe those are the kind of people God uses.
[time=470] We want to complete people in Christ.
[time=473] There's Christ again at the absolute center of our efforts.
[time=478] You've heard me say for years and others of you say it now.
[time=483] We hope and it is our prayer that those far from God would come to fully surrender their hearts and lives to Christ.
[time=494] You see, everywhere you turn, everywhere you go, if our eyes are on the prize, this thing's about Jesus.
[time=502] This thing is again and again about Christ, and our hope is that your understanding of Him, our hope is that your relationship with Him, which is what we're about, right?
[time=512] We're not about, we've told you this, we're not about religion, we're about a relationship with who, say it, Christ.
[time=520] And so over the next five weeks, we jump into a series beginning today called Jesus according to Jesus, because the truth of the matter is, while there are many opinions out there as to who He is and what He did while there's a whole lot of folks who will give you a whole lot of their perspective on Him, we thought we would just come back to the Word of God and allow Jesus Himself to define Himself for us.
[time=548] And Josh Rang is here this morning.
[time=550] Josh and Paula and the girls are part of our family.
[time=554] Josh, part of our preaching team.
[time=556] Josh graduated from Blackhawk Christian High School in 1991, way back then.
[time=563] And today's actually a special day.
[time=566] I'll let him tell you about what today is in his life.
[time=569] But I'm really grateful for Josh.
[time=571] We as a church are grateful for those who teach and preach in this setting.
[time=576] And I heard it first hour, and I can't wait for you to hear it this hour.
[time=580] Jesus being the vine, and all that that implies and all that that brings to your life and mind.
[time=587] So I'm grateful for Josh.
[time=588] Would you welcome Josh this morning?
[time=590] Well, I'm always thankful for the opportunity
[time=600] to be with you in this setting.
[time=602] And again, thankful for Kelly and the elders to give me the opportunity to come and to preach.
[time=606] But yeah, it is a special day for me in that some of you may not remember.
[time=611] But a few of you in this room were here with me 18 years ago
[time=617] in this very room, in this very time, as you were in there in the room with me.
[time=625] You don't remember, do you?
[time=626] Because you didn't know who I was at that point.
[time=628] But your father married me and my wife Paula 18 years ago in this very sanctuary.
[time=635] And so Paula is one of my greatest gifts on Earth and that I get to be here this morning to celebrate that with her and to be able to minister in that way.
[time=646] In this way, as I preach, it's just really special.
[time=648] So I'm really thankful for this place.
[time=650] Obviously, it touches my life in so many different ways.
[time=652] And I'm grateful for that.
[time=654] So if you have your Bibles turned to John chapter 15, we are in the midst of a new series on the I.M.s that you find in the Gospel of John as Jesus talks about himself.
[time=668] As he answers many questions about who he is, when he says in several different ways, "I.M." and then he finishes that statement.
[time=676] The first one comes in John chapter six.
[time=678] When he's there with the Pharisees and they're talking about Moses and they're talking about the fact that the Israelites back in the day, they received bread from heaven.
[time=689] And the Pharisees said, "You're not greater, Jesus.
[time=693] Are you then the prophet Moses who gave us this bread?" And he responds and says, "I.M. the bread of life," which came down from heaven.
[time=704] That was the first I.M. statement.
[time=706] Two chapters later in John chapter eight, he says, "I.M. the light of the world, who he who believes in me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." In John chapter 10, he talks about the fact that he is the door, the entrance into the pasture of God's sheep, that he is the only way that we can enter into a right relationship with the Father, that he is the door.
[time=731] In chapter 11, as his friend Lazarus had laid in the tomb for several days, and he and his disciples had actually delayed a couple days before coming.
[time=742] And Mary and Martha run to him when he comes and says, "Why didn't you come earlier?
[time=746] You could have healed him." And he says, "I.M. the resurrection and the life.
[time=751] He who believes in me will never die." So the idea that again, that he alone gives life, he can raise people from the dead, and he gives life.
[time=761] And then in John chapter 14, he says, "I.M. the way, the truth, and the life." No one comes to the Father, but through me.
[time=768] And now in John chapter 15, he says, "I.M. the true vine." And so I'm excited about this series because I believe it's a wonderful opportunity for us to dive deeper into the glories of who Jesus is and what he's accomplished.
[time=783] If you were here a couple weeks ago when I spoke about 1 John chapter 5, I talked about how God has adopted us and caused us to be born again into his family.
[time=793] And as family members, there's a family way that we love our brothers and sisters, but there's also family benefits that we have victory over the world.
[time=801] But then there's this family creed that you and I get to believe in that we get to express that Jesus is the Christ, that he is who he said he was, that he has accomplished what he said he came to do, and that he's alive and well and reigning at the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=819] And so what I encourage you to do that Sunday was to dive deeper and deeper and deeper into the beauty of Jesus,
[time=829] who he is and what he's accomplished, and what are the actual implications of what he's accomplished for our life today as believers.
[time=838] And so I think this series will help us do that.
[time=842] And so I just encourage you to sit still, to open your ears and resist the temptation that you might have to say in your mind, oh I've heard this before, this isn't for me.
[time=855] I believe it is.
[time=856] I believe God has you here for a very specific purpose.
[time=859] And so it's my prayer that your eyes would be open, your ears would be open to hear what God has for us this morning.
[time=866] Let's pray.
[time=867] Father, thank you that when your word goes forth, you accompany it with power.
[time=872] Lord, I do pray for all of us today.
[time=875] I pray that your spirit would be active and present.
[time=878] We eagerly anticipate the work of your spirit to help us to sit still.
[time=884] Or would you just in very practical ways help us to listen and focus, help us to not be distracted, help us to resist the temptation to think that this isn't for us.
[time=897] And would you help me to deliver your word for your glory in Christ's name?
[time=901] We pray.
[time=902] [AMEN] Well, John chapter 15, what if, if we could, what I would love to do is to take us all to the back of the property.
[time=910] I don't know if all of you have gone to the back of the property, but there's a road that goes kind of back to the addition back there.
[time=917] And on the right hand side of that road, there's a pretty decent sized field.
[time=922] And if I could, we'd all go out there and we'd take a look at that field and maybe think about what it would take to plan a vineyard, plan an orchard.
[time=932] And so we'd get that, you know, field ready and fertile and do everything that we could to get it set.
[time=939] And then we'd buy some saplings or some young shoots and we'd plant those shoots and we wouldn't see much of it the first year, but we'd continue to water it and we'd continue to tend it and do everything that we need to do.
[time=953] And I don't even know the half of that kind of stuff, but we do it.
[time=957] And next year, we might see a little bit of fruit on that vine.
[time=963] As we continue to care for it and tend it, the next year we might see a little bit more fruit as those saplings would start to grow and get some diameter around the trunk.
[time=973] And the very next year, there might be even more fruit.
[time=977] And then year after year, an increasing fruitfulness from a
[time=983] vineyard in Black Hawk's backlot, from an orchard, whatever it is that you may think there, but sticks would potentially maybe grow to apples and those small apples would turn to many apples and then to volumes of apples where then one tree would give several bushels of apples year after year after year.
[time=1006] There's a picture of a vineyard up here and it shows not, you know, apple trees, but it shows grapes and I guess I'd much rather take us all there than the backlot, but you get the picture.
[time=1019] As you see there, there's just vine after vine of fruit.
[time=1024] There's an understanding that next year there'll be even more fruit as that continues to grow.
[time=1031] It's a picture or a vision of fruitfulness and it leads us,
[time=1037] I believe, this morning to think of a similar picture, a similar vision of what Jesus is speaking about in John chapter 15, a vision of a fruitful people, gathered together in a fruitful
[time=1052] church, engaged together in a fruit bearing mission and not
[time=1059] just occasionally and not just when we feel up to it, but a
[time=1065] consistent fruit bearing long term year after year of steadily
[time=1071] increasing fruitfulness.
[time=1074] It's a beautiful picture.
[time=1077] It's a picture presented here in John chapter 15 and I believe that this is God's vision for us.
[time=1084] It's God's vision for every believer in every church that we would be a fruitful people and I think it's important as we dive into John chapter 15 to understand the background that while this is God's intention for his people, it was also his intention for his people in the Old Testament, the people of Israel.
[time=1105] And many times throughout the Old Testament, the nation of Israel was referred to as a vine and God intended Israel to
[time=1118] bear fruit.
[time=1119] They were described as a vine but they failed to accomplish what God intended for them.
[time=1124] They were unfruitful.
[time=1126] God had given them every opportunity and yet they continued to be unfruitful.
[time=1132] In Isaiah chapter 5, he speaks to this and he says this in verse 1, he says let me sing for my beloved my love song concerning his vineyard.
[time=1143] My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
[time=1146] He dug it.
[time=1147] He cleared it of stones and planted it with choice vines.
[time=1151] He built a watchtower in the midst of it.
[time=1153] He hewed out a wine vat in it and he looked for it to yield grapes but it yielded wild grapes.
[time=1159] And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, O men of Judah, judged between me and my vineyard, what more was there for me to do for my vineyard that I have not done in it.
[time=1170] Yet when I looked for it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes?
[time=1175] And now, I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard.
[time=1177] I will remove its hedge and it shall be devoured.
[time=1180] I will break down its wall and it shall be trampled down.
[time=1183] I will make it a waste.
[time=1185] It shall not be pruned or howed and briars and thorns shall grow up.
[time=1189] I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
[time=1193] For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel and the men of Judah are his pleasant planting.
[time=1200] You see, God intended Israel to be a vineyard that would produce fruit and yet they were unfruitful.
[time=1207] It says the very same thing in Jeremiah chapter 2 when he says this, I planted you as a choice vine.
[time=1215] Holy of pure seed, how then have you turned degenerate and become a wild vine, though you wash yourself with lie and use much soap.
[time=1223] The stain of your guilt is before me, declares the Lord.
[time=1227] You see, God and his graciousness gave them every opportunity, planted them with rich, fertile fertile soil and yet they
[time=1238] produced no fruit.
[time=1240] And so in the midst of Israel's failure, I believe that it's clear that God had something else in mind, something better,
[time=1250] something greater.
[time=1252] And now in our passage this morning in John chapter 15, that something better, that something greater is now revealed as Christ speaks to his disciples who would have been very familiar with the vine terminology and what that meant to Israel and he stands before them in that upper room and he says to them, I am the true vine.
[time=1277] I am the fulfillment of what God had intended for his people Israel and now it is fulfilled in me.
[time=1284] And now anyone who is connected to me can now bear fruit and will bear fruit.
[time=1291] You see, he says all of Israel's failure pointed to the real thing.
[time=1296] Christ was the fulfillment of what God intended.
[time=1300] Just like he had already said throughout the Gospel of John, when he's talking about the temple, he says, I am the true temple.
[time=1308] When he talks about the ceremonies and the festivals that Israel participated in, he said, I'm the fulfillment of those ceremonies into those festivals.
[time=1317] They point to me.
[time=1319] And then he says, I'm the fulfillment of the Mosaic law because I am the one who kept it perfectly.
[time=1327] And then he says here also, he says, I am the true vine.
[time=1332] And anyone who has a connection with me yields fruit.
[time=1337] So with this as our background, let's read John chapter 15 this morning and then we'll look to see what God has for us this morning.
[time=1346] John chapter 15 verse 1, I am the true vine Jesus says.
[time=1351] Tim speaking.
[time=1352] And my father is the vine dresser.
[time=1354] Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away.
[time=1357] And every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes that it may bear more fruit.
[time=1362] Already you are clean because of the word that I've spoken to you.
[time=1365] Abide in me and I and you as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me.
[time=1373] I am the vine.
[time=1374] You are the branches.
[time=1375] Whoever abides in me and I and him, he it is that bears much fruit.
[time=1380] For apart from me, you can do nothing.
[time=1383] If anyone does not abide in me, he is thrown away like a branch and withers and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned.
[time=1390] If you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you.
[time=1396] By this my father has glorified that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.
[time=1401] As the father has loved me, so have I loved you.
[time=1404] Abide in my love.
[time=1406] If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love just as I have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love.
[time=1412] These things I've spoken to you that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be full.
[time=1418] This is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you.
[time=1423] Greater love has no one than this that someone lay down his life for his friends.
[time=1428] You are my friends if you do what I command you.
[time=1431] No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing, but I have called you friends for all that I have learned from my father I've made known to you.
[time=1441] You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain so that whatever you ask the father in my name he may give it to you.
[time=1452] These things I command you so that you will love one another.
[time=1456] Well there are some very simple ideas in this passage and as you
[time=1464] can probably tell there are some very complex themes that are interwoven in and through these verses.
[time=1471] I don't believe I have the time nor the ability to unpack all of this for us.
[time=1477] In fact I don't even know if it's possible there's so much going on in this passage.
[time=1481] Yet this morning what I would like to do is just really unpack for us a few simple thoughts which Christ speaks about with great clarity.
[time=1491] Some simple statements that Jesus is making about bearing fruit because I believe that it's clear that this concept of fruit bearing is the central theme of these verses.
[time=1503] I mean look at what it says in verse 1, the father and the son are active in bearing fruit or having us bear fruit.
[time=1511] Verse 2 it says every branch that bears fruit, verse 3 that it may bear more fruit.
[time=1517] Verse 4 the branch cannot bear fruit by itself.
[time=1521] Verse 5 the branch that would bear much fruit in verse 8 bear much fruit and verse 16 that you would bear fruit and that fruit would remain.
[time=1533] I think it's very clear that the central burden of this passage, the intent of this passage is all about bearing fruit.
[time=1543] So if that, if that's true, let's take a quick second to think about what fruit is he talking about.
[time=1550] If that's the central theme, what kind of fruit is he discussing?
[time=1554] I believe we could go lots of different ways with this, but I think the context helps us understand I believe the fruit that he's talking about is anything that which flows out of our union with Christ.
[time=1566] Anything that is directly the result of being connected with Christ.
[time=1574] Anything that allows us to have the power of Christ, the passion of Christ, to come from him through us into this world.
[time=1586] It could be lots of different things. It could be being patient with your wife and kids because you are connected with Christ and you've received patience from him.
[time=1598] And so now out of the gratitude of his patience with you and receiving that patience because you're connected to him, now you can show patience to others. It may be not succumbing to guilt and condemnation when you sin the same sin day after day after day because you know if you're connected to Christ that there has been infused in you because of your connection, the truth that there is now no condemnation for you if you're in Christ.
[time=1630] And so the fruit of being connected with Christ is that you would not succumb to that guilt and that condemnation which is just the ploy of Satan. It may be sharing the truth about Christ with somebody because again you're so grateful for what you receive, the nourishment that comes from Christ that you can't help but just speak about him to others.
[time=1654] It may be helpful for us to think about it in the negative way it's anything that is a result of our connection with Christ but it's also nothing that is the result of our own efforts.
[time=1666] And so that's the fruit that Jesus is talking about and so in our time remaining I want to spend the time thinking about five statements, five statements about fruit bearing. Let's try to capture what Jesus is saying about this bearing fruit with five statements. We'll spend much of our time on the first one and then we'll quickly move through the other four. The first thing I believe that Christ is saying about fruit bearing is this. Fruit bearing is completely dependent upon being vitally connected with Christ. Look at what it says in verses four and five. Jesus says this "Abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine neither can you unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches whoever abides in me and I in him he it is that bears much fruit for apart from me you can do nothing." You see bearing fruit has everything to do with our connection to Christ. You cannot I cannot bear fruit on my own from my own efforts.
[time=1746] It's about being connected to him and let's think about this connection for a minute. I think it comes in two ways, this connection. First of all I think it comes in our getting connected to him first and foremost and then secondly staying connected with him. So first of all getting connected rightly to Jesus. It's talking about our salvation there and that's what the book of John is all about. In John chapter 20 verse 31 John gives us kind of a purpose statement for his book. He says this, "These things are written so that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and that believing you may have life in his name." You see the purpose of John is to reveal Jesus to such an extent that you would understand that he is the only way. He is the only answer, the only remedy to our sin problem. It's him and him alone. You see life is flowing from Christ and every human being has an amazing opportunity to connect to him through the gospel. The good news of Jesus Christ, it's right on your hand that Christ died for our sins.
[time=1826] Every human being has the opportunity to connect with him in this way and there is no other way. We need to understand that again in our own self-sufficiency we want to go our own way. We want to make our own choices.
[time=1846] We think we know what is good for us and what is right for us and the Bible describes that as sin when that's in direct contradiction to what God would have for us and yet God in his graciousness sent his son Jesus to come down to live a perfect life in accordance with the Father's will completely go to Calvary to die on a cross that he didn't deserve so that he could offer this life to us as he would take our sin upon himself and give us his very righteousness. It's the gospel.
[time=1882] It's the good news and so when we place our faith and trust in Christ something very real happens. Something very different happens.
[time=1890] We get plugged into him.
[time=1894] There is then an unbreakable union which begins in which we are now found to be in Christ.
[time=1902] We're no longer apart from him. We're no longer enemies.
[time=1906] Now we're friends. Now we're plugged in. We get plugged into his righteousness.
[time=1910] We get plugged into his power. We get plugged into his life.
[time=1914] We get plugged into his presence. We get plugged into the relationship that he has with the Father, with the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit in their perfect harmony and unity. We get to participate in that because we're in Christ.
[time=1930] We get plugged into his purposes, into his mission.
[time=1934] You see, once we're not even connected, right? We were isolated. We were on our own. We were going our own way. But now as we admit and confess our sinfulness and turn to Christ, he saves us.
[time=1950] We become a new creature.
[time=1954] 2 Corinthians 5, 17, if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature. The life of Christ flows into you as you get rightly connected to him. Understand this this morning. No branch has life in itself. You cannot have life apart from being connected to Christ. Every branch derives its life from the vine and the vine graciously supplies all that the branch needs.
[time=1986] It's getting connected to Jesus.
[time=1990] But it also, this verse talks about not just getting connected but staying connected to Jesus. The word abide, which means to remain or to stay.
[time=2002] It actually is used ten different times in six verses from verse 4 to 10. It's not talking about maintaining your salvation by your own efforts.
[time=2014] It's speaking specifically of your fruitfulness.
[time=2018] We'll just look at a couple in verse 4.
[time=2022] And notice the repetition of the word. Abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine.
[time=2030] Where can you unless you abide in me? I'm the vine. You are the branches.
[time=2034] Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit.
[time=2038] There's this idea of abiding or remaining or staying. Again, it's not talking about, I think it's important to understand this, not talking about maintaining your salvation by your efforts. It's speaking of your ongoing ability to be fruitful and to bear much fruit and more fruit.
[time=2058] It's kind of like what we talked about in first John chapter 5 a couple weeks ago.
[time=2062] When I talked about the fact that one of the benefits of being in the family of God is that there is victory for us over the world.
[time=2070] And yet it says there, while that victory is done through the work of Jesus, it's our faith that needs to be exercised in order for us to fully realize and experience that victory here and now.
[time=2082] Same thing is here.
[time=2086] The connection to Christ is an unbreakable union and at the same time our continued abiding allows us to experience the realities of his grace and goodness flowing into our lives in a very consistent way.
[time=2102] See, we need to, I think it comes down to this, we need to recognize a good thing when we see it, right? I mean that's a really good thing to be connected with Jesus. It reminds me of Peter on the Mount of Transfiguration in Matthew chapter 17.
[time=2118] You may not know the whole story but Peter and John and Jesus go up a mountain and when they're at the top of the mountain Jesus full glory gets revealed. Moses and Elijah come down out of the mountain and here's what Peter says. He's so overwhelmed. He's so enjoying the moment of just seeing God in his Jesus in his full glory.
[time=2138] He says this basically, this is my paraphrase, but he says Jesus, can I go get some roots, some booths for us so that we can stay here as long as we possibly can. I mean the idea is this, this is so good that I don't want to leave. The same thing here.
[time=2154] It is so good to abide in Christ on a consistent basis. He provides us nourishment and life, everything that we need.
[time=2166] See, there's a necessity of constant dependence upon Christ. So just a quick practical question. If that's so important, how do we do it? I mean what does that look like? Well I think two different ways. He answers it for us.
[time=2182] In verse 7 first, it says this, "If you abide in me and my words abide in you ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you. I think first of all there comes an idea of abiding in the words of Christ.
[time=2198] What that comes back to what I think is just diving into a consistent diet of God's word, the truth of Scripture. We get so many voices at us day after day and those voices that come from the world are in direct contradiction to what God has for you.
[time=2218] And we need to know this word.
[time=2222] We need to study it. We need to meditate upon it. We need to love it.
[time=2226] We need to abide and stay in it.
[time=2230] It's his truth. It's kind of like what Peter said again in John chapter 6.
[time=2234] As Jesus said some difficult words, and Jesus looks at his disciples because many of the other disciples had left and he says, "Do you want to leave also?" And Peter says, "Why would we leave? Only you have words of eternal life." It's here. It's in his word. But there's a second place. It's not just there, but it says later on in verse 9, look at what he says, "As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you, abide in my love." It's not just the truth of Scripture, but it's the reality of the work of Christ in your life on a daily basis that we need to abide in. The truth of what Jesus has done and how that impacts my life today as a believer is where I want to stay.
[time=2290] My question for you this morning is how well do you know the gospel?
[time=2294] Is it something that just happened in the past, or is it something that you treasure, that you hold on to, that you want to dive deeper and deeper into? You see, when I sin, I have no better place to go than the love of Christ. Because I know that when I run to Him, I am going to find forgiveness.
[time=2318] I'm going to find the truth that I need to hear with great love and with His great patience. He's going to help me repent to turn from that sin. He's going to cover it completely and help me walk in obedience. If I do it again, I'm going to run back to His love again because He's going to help me through that same process.
[time=2338] I'm going to write in His love. When I feel insecure, I'm going to run to His love because I know that He loves me not based upon my performance, but because I'm His child. We need to abide in His love to continue to trust that what He accomplished is real. So the first statement that Jesus makes about fruit-bearing is that it's completely dependent upon the vital connection with Him. I believe that's the main thrust of the passage.
[time=2370] And so having covered that in depth, we can move through these next four much more quickly. The second thing that Jesus says about fruit-bearing is this. Fruit-bearing can increase, but it requires pruning. Look at what it says in verses 1 and 2.
[time=2386] He says, "I am the true vine. My father's the vine-dresser.
[time=2390] Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away." We'll talk about that in a minute. "And every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes that it may bear more fruit." You see, God is committed to pruning. He wants us to be fruitful, and so He is committed to make sure that that happens. No fruit-bearing branch is exempt.
[time=2414] He is actively engaged in our lives.
[time=2418] When I think about pruning, or when I go back and maybe we can put the picture up, but that could be that same vineyard that we looked at with all those grapes on it.
[time=2426] And yet here it is. And to me, I'm always amazed at how much gets cut back. Aren't you?
[time=2434] I mean, to me, it looks like those things are just dead and gone.
[time=2438] But yet, next season, more fruit than the season before, because of the pruning, cutting it back, taking it away.
[time=2450] You know, the process may involve pain at times.
[time=2454] It may not sometimes, but it's God's loving purpose.
[time=2458] It reminds me, I really enjoy the Chronicles of Narnia. Book 5 is the voyage of the Dawn Tretter.
[time=2466] There's a character in there called Eustice Scrub. I think it's just, first of all, a great name. But Eustice was just kind of a miserable, whiny kid.
[time=2474] And he gets to come to Narnia with his cousins this time for the first time.
[time=2478] And throughout the story, he ends up becoming a dragon because in his selfishness he goes off on his own and is trying to get some jewels. And he turns into a dragon.
[time=2490] And throughout the process of him kind of changing and understanding his selfishness, he eventually meets Aslan, who's the Christ figure. And Eustice had tried to scrape off the skin of the dragon, never got anywhere. But here's what it says.
[time=2510] The very first tear he made, so Eustice is now talking about Aslan doing some work on him. The very first tear he made was so deep that I had thought had gone right into my heart.
[time=2522] And when he began pulling the skin off, it hurt worse than anything I ever felt. The only thing that made me able to bear it was just the pleasure of feeling the stuff being peeled off.
[time=2534] You know, if you've ever picked the scab off of a sore place, it hurts like billio, but it is such fun to see it coming away.
[time=2542] Edmund says, "I know what you mean." And then Eustice goes on. Well, he peeled the beastly stuff right off. Just as I thought I'd done it myself the other three times when I tried to do it on my own. Only those times it didn't hurt. And there it was, lying on the grass.
[time=2558] Only ever so much thicker and darker and more knobby looking than the others had been. And there I was, as smooth and soft as peeled switch and smaller than I had been, then he caught hold of me. I didn't like that much, for I was very tender underneath now that I had no skin on. And he threw me into the water. It smarted like anything, but only for a moment after that it became perfectly delicious. And as soon as I started swimming and splashing, I found that all the pain had gone from my arm.
[time=2590] See, Aslan had to do the work.
[time=2594] Just like God does the work on us sometimes.
[time=2598] I'm convinced that this pruning is really all about minimizing me.
[time=2606] It's about minimizing my efforts and my passions and my idols in my life. Like John the Baptist who said to Jesus, "He must increase and I must decrease." That's what I think this pruning is about.
[time=2622] You see, my flesh, I'm sure you're the same way, wants to say that I don't need to be connected to Christ. I feel like I'm self-sufficient, self-autonomous, and yet God in His perfect patience and grace wields the circumstances of life in and through our lives to scrape away ourselves so that Jesus can shine through. See, these circumstances may be long, they may be hard, they may even hurt, but therefore are good that we would bear much fruit. The third thing that Jesus says about fruit-bearing is this. Fruit-bearing is advanced by praying. You can look in verse 7 and verse 16 to see this, but as you abide in Him and He abides in you, there is a sweet fellowship that takes place. And what I believe happens is that now His desires become your desires. And as you pray through His desires, that actually takes place because it's no longer your desires anymore. It's been replaced by His desires. And His desires is that you would bear much fruit. Fruit-bearing is advanced by praying. I'm shaped by Christ's desire.
[time=2694] Fourth, the fourth thing that Jesus says is this.
[time=2698] The absence of fruit. I'm listening to this this morning.
[time=2702] The absence of fruit is an indication of the absence of life. Look at what it says in verse 2.
[time=2710] "Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away." There is throughout the New Testament
[time=2720] a theme of those who would get somewhat close to Christ, even listen to His words, even mainly acknowledge some of those truths, and yet they fall away because they never really engaged in who He was. They were never willing to get rid of themselves, to humble themselves.
[time=2740] And what this is talking about is when there is no fruit, there is an absence of life. The same in verse 6 says this, "If anyone does not abide in me, he's thrown away like a branch in withers, and the branches are gathered and thrown into the fire and burned." See, it's a warning.
[time=2760] Verse 8 talks about this as well that says, "That you would bear much fruit, because as you're bearing fruit you would so prove to be my disciples. The fruit doesn't make you a disciple, but it shows that you've been made a new creature, and that his life is coming from him to you, and the fruit is just something that happens.
[time=2784] The absence of fruit is an indication of the absence of life.
[time=2788] And finally, the fifth thing that Jesus says about fruit-bearing is this, fruit-bearing yields God's glory and our joy.
[time=2800] Verse 8, "By this my father is glorified that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples." Just quickly to know that when you bear fruit, and it's actually when Christ bears fruit through you, it brings great honor and glory to our father. Secondly, as it says in verse 11, "These things I've spoken to you that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be full. As you bear fruit it yields joy in your life. More joy than you could muster up." See, I really believe that no one wakes up and decides to make choices which will make them miserable, right? None of us wake up to do that.
[time=2848] We make choices. We all think we're making choices which will yield happiness for us, right?
[time=2856] But understand the difference between pleasure and joy.
[time=2860] Pleasure is something that only lasts as long as the experience that produces the pleasure. If I'm eating and I'm enjoying a meal, you know, I wish my stomach could tell me when it's full, right?
[time=2876] But even if it could, I still probably wouldn't listen to it because I know that if I stop eating, I'll stop the pleasure of how that food tastes. True for anything.
[time=2888] As soon as the experience is over, the pleasure fades very quickly. But joy is not like that.
[time=2896] Joy is not attached to an experience but to an ongoing reality of fruitfulness as we connect to the vine. Listen, there is little else that will produce joy in your life like bearing fruit through the life-giving nourishment of the vine which is Christ.
[time=2916] So two final thoughts in conclusion.
[time=2920] Something to know, something to do.
[time=2924] Something to know, first of all, know this. That God is committed to his children bearing fruit. So committed is he that he planted a vine, Jesus. And he connects us into that vine so that fruit would be a result.
[time=2940] The personal pronoun for Jesus, either I or me or my, is used more times than any other word in these verses. It's used 24 times in verses 1 through 11. See, while the theme is for us to bear fruits, the main idea is that Jesus is the only one who can produce that fruit in us.
[time=2964] Understand this, that Jesus is our life as Christians. He is our nourishment. He is our starting point, ending point, and anything in between.
[time=2976] Jesus is our everything. He is the vine.
[time=2980] And then finally something to do.
[time=2984] There's only two commands in this passage and it's the same word, abide.
[time=2992] What Jesus wants us to do is to remain in him, to rest in him, to stay close and connected to him.
[time=3004] Because he knows that's what's good for us.
[time=3008] So as you drive by the back of the property someday, maybe you go out that little road that's headed to the addition behind us and you see the field on the right, the grassy field.
[time=3020] Every once in a while, just envision an apple orchard back there that we discussed at the beginning. And may that be a reminder of God's vision for you, God's vision for us as his church, a vision of fruitful people, gathered together in a fruitful church, engaged together in a fruit-bearing mission, not just occasionally but a consistent fruit-bearing long-term year after year, steadily increasing fruitfulness for his glory, for your joy and only through the work of Jesus, that's fine. Let's pray. Father, thank you so much for your word and the truth of your word. Thank you for your commitment to us, which ultimately is a commitment to your glory, that you would have us bear much fruit.
[time=3076] Lord, I just want to pray right now for those that might be going through a season of pruning, or would you help them to wait upon you? Would you help them to rest in your love and in your sovereign goodness to them? Lord, would you help us all to bear fruit? And the only way we can do that is by abiding in our vine. May we rest in your word. May we rest in your love. We love you. We thank you and we praise you. In Christ's name, amen.
[time=3118] Crown Him with many crowns.
[time=3124] The Lamb upon His throne.
[time=3130] Our cow, the heavenly and
[time=3136] thumbed rounds.
[time=3138] Oh, music by its soul.
[time=3144] Oh, make my soul and sing of him who died for me.
[time=3158] In heaven, as like much less king, through all eternity.
[time=3174] Majesty.
[time=3178] Lord of all.
[time=3182] Let every throw before the king of kings. Oh, come and glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory.
[time=3206] Come in the Lord of all.
[time=3212] O you try unto the brave.
[time=3218] And rose victorious in
[time=3224] the strife.
[time=3226] For those who get to sing.
[time=3232] His glory is now we sing.
[time=3238] Who died and rose from love.
[time=3246] O you try to turn all life to bring and his death to the majesty.
[time=3260] Majesty.
[time=3262] Lord of all Let every throw before the king of kings. Oh, come unto a God who reigns forevermore forevermore Oh, every demon.
[time=3298] Lord, he has died for him.
[time=3304] His praise and glory shall not bear through our eternity.
[time=3316] Oh, every demon.
[time=3344] Majesty.
[time=3348] Lord of all Let every throw before the king of kings. Oh, come unto a God who reigns forevermore.
[time=3372] Majesty.
[time=3376] Lord of all Let every throw before him. Oh, the king of kings. Oh, come unto a God who reigns forevermore forevermore.
[time=3404] Oh, every man.
[time=3420] Lord of endless life Let your glory shine forever all the earth.
[time=3430] All the earth will sing your praise.
[time=3436] Oh, all every heart and the joy may be left and higher.
[time=3446] All our hearts.
[time=3448] All our hearts will sing your praise.
[time=3452] Let's all stand together.
[time=3454] God be exalted.
[time=3458] God be exalted in everything.
[time=3464] We live for your glory.
[time=3470] God be exalted.
[time=3476] God be exalted in everything.
[time=3482] We live for your glory.
[time=3488] Let's worship him.
[time=3492] Let's praise him.
[time=3496] Thank you, Lord.
[time=3500] We've had a great time in God's house today. Thank you for singing. Thank you for listening. What a fantastic word we've had.
[time=3508] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we thank you.
[time=3512] Thank you for meeting us here today, Lord.
[time=3514] Thank you for just the wonderful time that it's been in your house.
[time=3518] Lord, protect us as we go out and bring us back safely next week, Lord.
[time=3528] In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[time=3530] Have a great week.
[time=3532] You're loved.
[time=3542] You
