[time=0] (upbeat music) - Well hello again and welcome
[time=30] to the broadcast.
[time=30] It's great to have you with us.
[time=32] I'm so thankful for these moments that we get to share together before you take in the whole broadcast.
[time=38] I was thinking this morning on the way in that the series we're in right now, this series we've entitled, "Jesus According to Jesus," is really important.
[time=47] It's important for me and I think really important for many of you as well and here's why.
[time=52] Blackhawk has always been, we've said it for years.
[time=55] If you know us, you've heard us say this, that we're not about religion.
[time=59] And as I say that, I may surprise a few of you who maybe are getting to know us or you're new to the broadcast or new to the Blackhawk family.
[time=67] We are not about religion.
[time=69] You see, religion is man-made.
[time=73] Religion is about do's and don'ts.
[time=75] Religion tends to be about rules.
[time=78] Religions are man-made systems put in place to try and get men to get women, to get mankind to sort of work their way, earn their way, do their way toward God, and God never intended religion.
[time=96] God always was about relationship.
[time=99] God never expected you to earn your way.
[time=102] God gave you a gift, it's called His Son, Jesus Christ.
[time=106] And in that gift, He gives us this unbelievable privilege of relationship with Him.
[time=111] And so it's about relationship with Christ.
[time=114] It is about intimacy with the Lord.
[time=116] It is about following Jesus.
[time=118] It's about this close, very tight, very personal, very up close, very much a part of your life relationship with Christ.
[time=128] It's not about a list of do's and religious don'ts.
[time=132] And so when we talk to you about Jesus, according to Jesus, five weeks giving you this insight into who Jesus said He was, the things that Jesus was about, the things that characterized Jesus' life and heart and ministry.
[time=148] Most importantly, the things Jesus said about Himself, the study is about all the I Am's.
[time=155] I am the bread of life.
[time=157] I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[time=159] I am the resurrection.
[time=161] I am the vine.
[time=163] There are all these statements Jesus makes that are very important for you and me to understand.
[time=168] And it's so important, not just because of the knowledge component, but because of who's saying it.
[time=174] It's the one you and I are to live in relationship with.
[time=177] It's the one you and I are to know deeply.
[time=180] And so I hope you'll come and be with us.
[time=182] If you haven't been in a while, I hope you'll walk through these doors and spend these next few weeks with us in August.
[time=188] I'll tell you what September's gonna be amazing around here, but August, Jesus, according to Jesus, a chance for you and I to further our relationship with Him, not religion, and in the furthering of relationship, grow our faith and be the people God has called us to be.
[time=205] Hey, thank you for tuning in.
[time=206] As always, it's great to be together.
[time=208] God bless you, and we hope to see you soon.
[time=211] [MUSIC - 20 seconds]
[time=258] (upbeat music)
[time=288] [MUSIC] God is able [MUSIC] He will never fail [MUSIC] He is on my sea, God [MUSIC] Greater than all we see [MUSIC] Greater than all we ask [MUSIC] He has done great fear [MUSIC] Lived it up [MUSIC] He defeated the grave [MUSIC] Raised to life [MUSIC] Our God is able [MUSIC] In His name [MUSIC] We overcome [MUSIC] For the Lord [MUSIC] Our God is able [MUSIC] Yes [MUSIC] God is with us, God is with us [MUSIC] God is on our side [MUSIC] He will make a way [MUSIC] Far above all we know [MUSIC] Far above all we know [MUSIC] He has done great fear [MUSIC] Lived it up [MUSIC] He defeated the grave [MUSIC] Raised to life [MUSIC] Our God is able [MUSIC] In His name [MUSIC] We overcome [MUSIC] For the Lord [MUSIC] Our God is able [MUSIC] God is with us, and He will go before [MUSIC] He will never leave us, He will never leave us [MUSIC] God is for us, and He has opened arms [MUSIC] He will never fail us, He will never fail us [MUSIC] He lifted us, He defeated the grave [MUSIC] It's too light, our God is able [MUSIC] In His name we overcome [MUSIC] For the Lord our God is able [MUSIC] Lift Him up, lift Him up [MUSIC] He defeated the grave [MUSIC] It's too light, our God is able [MUSIC] In His name we overcome [MUSIC] For the Lord our God is able [MUSIC] For the Lord our God is able [MUSIC] For the Lord our God is able â™ª
[time=512] - Good to see all of you.
[time=524] I'm grateful for this family and thankful for the opportunity God has given us here in August to dive into a series that one of our teaching pastors, Josh Rang, started us in on last week.
[time=537] We've entitled the series Jesus, according to Jesus, because there are so many opinions about Jesus.
[time=544] There's so many perspectives about Jesus.
[time=547] There's so much out there.
[time=549] People saying this, people saying that.
[time=551] We thought we would just open the Bible and let Jesus tell us about Jesus.
[time=558] We want to just see what His words are.
[time=560] And so we come to these, I am.
[time=563] These, I am statements in the gospel of John.
[time=566] And this morning we come to part two in our series, I Am The Way, I Am The Truth, I Am The Life.
[time=573] And if you would, in honor of God's word stand, let me read to you this morning from John chapter 14.
[time=579] Open your Bibles, if you would, open your iPads, your app on your phone.
[time=584] However it is, you've got the Scriptures in front of you.
[time=587] Would you just let me read this to you, John?
[time=590] Chapter 14 verses one to six, and I'm reading from the NASB.
[time=596] Now, little context for you, John 13, the disciples are starting to get a little nervous, the disciples are starting to get a little confused and worried, they continue to hear Jesus talking about the fact that He's taken off.
[time=610] And they're a little worried by this, and so he says in John 14 1, Do not let your heart be troubled.
[time=620] Believe in God.
[time=622] Believe also in me, Jesus here speaking with His disciples.
[time=625] Believe also in me.
[time=627] In my father's house are many dwelling places.
[time=630] If it were not so, I would have told you, for I go to prepare a place for you.
[time=636] Encouraging words, amen, for those who follow Christ.
[time=640] I go to prepare a place for you.
[time=641] If I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again.
[time=647] I will come again and receive you to myself that where I am, there you may be also.
[time=656] And you know the way.
[time=660] Jesus says you know the road.
[time=664] Roads and paths and ways were big deals to those folks in that culture, and He says to His disciples, you know the way where I am going.
[time=674] And Thomas looks him straight in the eye.
[time=676] Thomas said, "Lord, we do not know where you are going.
[time=680] How do we know the way?" Jesus said to Him.
[time=685] Say it with me, Church.
[time=687] I am the way and the truth and the life.
[time=691] No one comes to the Father, but through me.
[time=696] Our Father in heaven, we come before you this morning, expect and hopeful that you will teach us through your Word, that your Holy Spirit will remind and encourage and convict us.
[time=710] God, as we look into this statement made by your Father, we look into this statement.
[time=718] Your Holy Spirit will remind and encourage and convict us.
[time=723] God, as we look into this statement made by your Son, may it make sense.
[time=729] May it bring clarity.
[time=732] May it help us at the deepest level.
[time=735] Understand you better.
[time=737] And may it help us better follow your Son, the author and perfecter of life.
[time=744] In your Son's name we pray.
[time=746] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=750] All right, so it was last fall, I believe probably November, and I had the real privilege.
[time=758] It was quite an opportunity.
[time=761] My oldest son plays basketball at Michigan State.
[time=764] They were opening their season over at Romstein Air Force Base in just outside of Frankfurt, Germany.
[time=772] There's the Michigan State crew and one of the guys in our church had graciously given me just a bunch of frequent flyer miles, so I was able to get over to Germany, and so I hopped on a flight and went over to Frankfurt.
[time=787] Romstein Air Force Base is about two hours north of Frankfurt,
[time=794] so I got a hotel room in Frankfurt, got a rental car, and then was able to, over the three days or so, just drive out to the base, back to Frankfurt, out to the base, back to Frankfurt.
[time=807] Well, I got to tell you, first of all, if you know me, you know that this is true.
[time=812] One of the greatest gifts God ever gave me, one of the greatest realizations I've ever experienced.
[time=818] One of the most amazing moments in my adult life was the day I got introduced to the Autobahn.
[time=828] Are you kidding me?
[time=830] Has anybody ever driven on the Autobahn?
[time=833] All right, oh my goodness, unbelievable.
[time=837] You see the little sign there, the blurred 130?
[time=841] And I know it's kilometers and not miles, but I don't care.
[time=845] There's no speed limit on the Autobahn.
[time=848] When I say I rented a car, I'm not going to tell you what kind I got, but I'm telling you, it was a quicker car than the one I drive.
[time=856] And I had so much fun, so much fun, I took a picture.
[time=859] I took a picture, that's a real picture from my cell phone.
[time=862] Right when I got past 130, now you're thinking 130 kilometers per hour, and I'll tell you, that's only like 80 miles an hour.
[time=869] I'm just saying, that was with one hand on a phone.
[time=873] All right, and I figured once I got up past about 150, 160, I promise you, the phone went away and I was holding on with both hands.
[time=881] It was an absolute kick to drive on the Autobahn.
[time=885] The Autobahn out to Ramstein Air Force Base.
[time=888] First day, see the team, get to watch them practice, have dinner, end up getting to hang out with Russell for a little bit.
[time=894] It got a little late, but I didn't care because I had no schedule and I had only to get back to Frankfurt.
[time=900] And so I stopped at the concierge desk there at the place before I head back because no shot to any of you who know me.
[time=906] I had misplaced the map quest directions that the guy at the Marriott in Frankfurt had given me, which were great, and I couldn't find him.
[time=916] And so I stopped by and this guy in real broken English speaking and a very broken English writing gives me directions to Frankfurt.
[time=925] Some of you would be nervous at that point.
[time=927] Anybody who knows me knows I wasn't.
[time=929] It was no big deal.
[time=930] I got there.
[time=931] I can get back.
[time=933] It's okay.
[time=934] So it's 11 o'clock, 11 30 at night.
[time=936] I had out for Frankfurt from Ramstein.
[time=939] And I think I may have even been on the phone talking to home a little bit.
[time=943] Just with the time chains, I was able to kind of check in and see what was going on.
[time=947] Tell them about my first day on the bass.
[time=949] And I'm talking on the phone.
[time=950] The music's going.
[time=951] And I'm just making turns.
[time=956] I'm just thinking, you know, this looks familiar.
[time=958] And I'm making turns.
[time=959] And hey, yeah, how you guys doing?
[time=961] Good.
[time=961] Hold on.
[time=962] Change the station.
[time=963] Yeah, I'm good.
[time=964] You wouldn't leave this place.
[time=965] I think I'm going to tie this.
[time=966] That looks familiar.
[time=967] So I just start turning and I'm talking and 30 minutes goes by.
[time=971] Get off the phone.
[time=972] Turn the radio down.
[time=973] Because quite honestly, it's starting to look very unfamiliar.
[time=979] And I can't quite figure out what happened.
[time=981] Because I had this nailed.
[time=983] I mean, I got there.
[time=984] No problem.
[time=985] And now it's getting darker and darker and darker.
[time=989] The road's starting to look like this right there.
[time=992] All I can see is the yellow line.
[time=994] There's no city lights.
[time=996] There's no road signs.
[time=997] I go another 45 minutes into sheer darkness.
[time=1003] And quite honestly, now it's been about an hour and a half.
[time=1006] And I'm really starting to feel it.
[time=1009] And I finally, after talking myself out of this for about a half hour, I finally get over
[time=1018] on the side of the road and come to the realization that I am absolutely.
[time=1025] And completely, without a shadow of a doubt, lost.
[time=1031] In a foreign country, in the middle of the night.
[time=1038] And logic's trying to kick in.
[time=1040] I mean, I'm saying to myself, what's the worst that can happen?
[time=1043] I just spend the night right here.
[time=1045] I'll be fine.
[time=1046] Oh, the sun comes up and there'll be people in awe.
[time=1050] I don't have to be bad.
[time=1051] I'm starting till five o'clock.
[time=1052] The next evening, I can go back.
[time=1054] I was scared to death.
[time=1056] I'm just being honest with you.
[time=1057] I was scared.
[time=1058] I was lost.
[time=1060] I had no idea where I was.
[time=1062] I didn't know whether to walk right or left.
[time=1066] And so there I am.
[time=1067] Wrong road.
[time=1072] Bad directions.
[time=1076] It may have been me on the phone, I'm not sure.
[time=1080] I'll just say bad directions that made me feel better.
[time=1086] Dead in the water.
[time=1089] Had no idea what to do.
[time=1092] And Jesus said, what about himself?
[time=1097] Jesus said, I am the way.
[time=1101] I am the road.
[time=1103] I am the path.
[time=1105] Jesus says, I am the truth.
[time=1109] Reliable direction.
[time=1111] Jesus says, I am the life.
[time=1114] Future hope for those who need it.
[time=1119] And John 14-6, my friends.
[time=1121] I hope you're there.
[time=1122] John 14-6 reminds us of three really important things.
[time=1127] And here's the first.
[time=1128] There are lost people.
[time=1131] And I hope that you're okay with that.
[time=1134] I hope that you realize that there are lost people in your world.
[time=1139] There are lost people in your family.
[time=1141] There are lost people in your workplace.
[time=1144] There are lost people where you live.
[time=1146] There are lost people in this community of ours.
[time=1150] You know what?
[time=1151] There may even be a few lost people here today.
[time=1157] Lost people with bad directions.
[time=1163] GPS, not working.
[time=1166] Mapquest, lost.
[time=1169] There are lost people with bad directions and only Jesus can guide them home.
[time=1174] Let's think about this church.
[time=1175] Don't forget this.
[time=1176] Please, Jesus longs for people scarred by sin to be healed and made new.
[time=1180] Do you know that?
[time=1181] It's really true.
[time=1182] Jesus longs for people scarred by sin to be healed and made new.
[time=1188] Jesus wants people.
[time=1190] The verse says it, separated from the Father to come to the Father.
[time=1196] This is on the heart of Jesus Christ.
[time=1198] He wants people separated from God to be able to come to the Father.
[time=1203] I am the way, the truth and the life.
[time=1205] No man comes to the Father, but by me.
[time=1211] That's why the Father sent him.
[time=1213] Luke 19, you can just write that down.
[time=1215] Luke 19 says the Son has come that God has sent the Son.
[time=1218] Luke 19 says the Son has come to seek out and to save those who are what?
[time=1226] Say it, lost.
[time=1230] Please don't miss this church.
[time=1232] God's message to mankind.
[time=1234] God's message to you today is this, if you and I aren't personally connected.
[time=1239] God says if you're not with me, join to me at the deepest level in a fully surrendered
[time=1246] relationship with my son.
[time=1251] You're on the wrong way.
[time=1258] He doesn't know how else to say that.
[time=1261] You're on the wrong road.
[time=1265] You are lost.
[time=1268] And I know you might say, what are you talking about?
[time=1272] Let's talk about this for a second.
[time=1273] You might say, those of you in this room hearing this, those of you maybe watching live stream
[time=1281] online, you may bump into this, you in the room, like I bump into this as I have conversation
[time=1288] with people outside the faith.
[time=1290] Some of them will say, quit calling me lost.
[time=1294] They say, I'm not lost.
[time=1300] And I always want to smile at them.
[time=1303] I always kind of want to chuckle because who have you ever met?
[time=1308] I mean, let's just be honest.
[time=1309] Who have you ever met who was lost that when you told them they were lost?
[time=1314] They said, oh, you're right.
[time=1317] I'm thinking about me in Germany that night.
[time=1320] I went an hour, maybe an hour and a half.
[time=1323] I'm good.
[time=1325] I knew I wasn't good.
[time=1326] I knew this wasn't making sense, but for about an hour and a half, no big deal.
[time=1330] I'm looking at some of you men in the room.
[time=1332] And I'm looking at that wonderful wife sitting next to you.
[time=1335] And how many times in the last 10, 20, 30 years has she just nicely looked over at you and said, do you think you might want to stop and ask for directions?
[time=1346] And you look back at her every time and say, no, I'm good.
[time=1350] I got this.
[time=1355] And I'm not being punitive here.
[time=1357] I'm not slapping you on the wrist here, lost person.
[time=1363] It's just typically what lost people say.
[time=1369] I think about, let's take it out of the navigation world.
[time=1372] I just think about it in the spiritual realm.
[time=1375] I think about, this is maybe not your experience.
[time=1378] There may be somebody here in the room who the very first time you ever heard the gospel, you went, boom, I'm in.
[time=1386] That makes sense.
[time=1388] But I think about the thousands of people I know, and you're looking at one of them, who the first time I heard the gospel, it was like, yeah.
[time=1398] I said to myself, what?
[time=1402] I'm good.
[time=1406] It's what lost people say.
[time=1408] It's how lost people think for a while.
[time=1412] Within a few months, go by.
[time=1415] And a few hours go by in the dark of Germany.
[time=1419] Then a few weeks go by.
[time=1421] Then a couple of years go by and life just gets dicier.
[time=1425] The struggle persists down deep inside.
[time=1429] You begin to realize that you really were made for so much more than this wandering.
[time=1438] So much more than the emptiness and the futility of this life.
[time=1442] You're living that's truthfully no life at all.
[time=1446] And you know it and eventually guess what you do.
[time=1450] I did it in Germany.
[time=1453] I did it personally and spiritually in 1983.
[time=1457] I know as I look around this room, many of you finally came to the point where you did this.
[time=1463] You pull over.
[time=1467] You pull off to the side of the road.
[time=1470] You look around.
[time=1471] You honestly survey the situation and you finally say it.
[time=1477] I've taken too many wrong turns.
[time=1482] I am utterly and completely lost.
[time=1491] I sat there in an Audi.
[time=1498] I sat there in an Audi on the side of that road.
[time=1500] I was scared.
[time=1501] I just was.
[time=1502] I don't mean to spiritualize this thing because part of me thinks God could care less if I'm lost on the side of a road in Germany.
[time=1508] But I just said, "Oh God, please, if there's like some way this could work out." I just kept driving.
[time=1514] I came around a couple corners.
[time=1516] Came into a village.
[time=1517] I mean village.
[time=1518] I mean like, not city.
[time=1520] I mean village.
[time=1521] I mean like mud buildings and no lights.
[time=1523] And I promise you, I come around the last turn in this village and there's a convenience store.
[time=1531] In the middle of Germany, in the middle of the night, it had to be like a mirage.
[time=1537] It was a convenience store with a gas pump out front and the lights on as bright as day and this old guy sitting behind a counter like waiting for me.
[time=1547] He had a heart just, I breathe this deep sigh and I walk in and I tell the guy a little broken English but he's getting it.
[time=1554] And I tell him I'm trying to go to Frankfurt and he laughs at me.
[time=1559] He just unleashes this gut wrenching chuckle.
[time=1564] And the translation was like, "Dude, you're so lost.
[time=1569] You're so far away from Frankfurt.
[time=1571] You couldn't be anyway." So he gets out piece of paper and he literally writes out for me exactly.
[time=1579] He draws pictures of road signs.
[time=1583] It takes up the back.
[time=1585] He draws a map for me on how to get back to the Marriott in Frankfurt.
[time=1592] His heart went out to me because I was on the wrong way.
[time=1598] I had no source of true direction and I was lifeless.
[time=1604] I was dead in the water and thank God for this man in a convenience store, in a village in Germany.
[time=1613] The truth be told, I'm not even sure if it exists.
[time=1616] It seemed too weird.
[time=1618] But it brings us to our second reminder from John 14.6.
[time=1622] There's only one way back to Frankfurt, amen?
[time=1628] You see Jesus talking this way.
[time=1631] You see him and you hear him communicating like this in a number of settings.
[time=1634] Look at John 10.
[time=1636] John 10 said, in John 10 7, it says, "So Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you.' He said to them again, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door.
[time=1646] I am the door.
[time=1647] All who come before me are thieves.
[time=1649] All who came before me are thieves and robbers.
[time=1652] But the sheep did not hear them.
[time=1653] I am the door.
[time=1656] If anyone enters through me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.
[time=1664] The thief comes only to still kill and destroy.
[time=1666] I came that they may have a life and have it abundantly.
[time=1671] I am.
[time=1672] I see that I am the door.
[time=1674] I am the way to salvation.
[time=1676] Go to Acts 4.
[time=1678] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts.
[time=1680] Just go one book over.
[time=1682] Acts 4.
[time=1683] The apostles are beginning to articulate the very foundations of our faith.
[time=1688] It says in Acts 4.9, it says, "If we are on trial today, this is a great passage.
[time=1696] Peter and John have been arrested.
[time=1699] They are performing miracles in the name of Christ." And in verse 9, it says, "If we are on trial today for a benefit done to a sick man as
[time=1708] to how this man has been made well, let it be known to all of you and to all the people
[time=1714] of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene whom you crucified, whom God
[time=1721] raised from the dead by this name, this man stands here before you in good health.
[time=1727] He is the stone, this Christ." Peter goes on.
[time=1732] He is the stone which was rejected by you, the builders, but which became the chief corner stone.
[time=1738] Here it is.
[time=1739] And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven that
[time=1747] has been given among men by which we must be saved.
[time=1754] One way, one way, one name, one opportunity, not two, not three, not many.
[time=1767] Now I've heard people say, as you've heard people say over the years, that this is what really turns them off, they say.
[time=1773] This is the point right here that really annoys them about our Christianity.
[time=1778] They say it's so exclusive.
[time=1782] We want something that's a little more inclusive.
[time=1785] I mean, what are you guys thinking?
[time=1787] There's just one way.
[time=1791] They say that it's arrogant.
[time=1797] They say that it's prideful of Jesus.
[time=1799] They say Jesus is arrogant, narrow, and prideful.
[time=1805] If he says he is the only way, I would suggest to you, listen, I would suggest to you this morning that it is in no way arrogant.
[time=1815] I would suggest to you this morning that it is, in fact, extremely narrow, very narrow.
[time=1827] And it's not prideful.
[time=1828] I would suggest to you, it's the most loving thing anyone ever said in all of time, and
[time=1835] explain that.
[time=1836] When the guy, when the angel in Germany at the convenience store told me exactly how to
[time=1850] get back to Frankfurt, did I say to him, hey, Franz, did I say, hey, Franz, I just want
[time=1858] you to know that in this little interaction with you, I found you to be extremely arrogant.
[time=1863] Like who died and made you direction king?
[time=1866] I mean, who says you're the only guy that can help me get back to the Marriott, dude?
[time=1872] I mean, did I say that?
[time=1874] I mean, I wanted to jump over the counter and kiss his feet.
[time=1879] It never crossed my mind for a moment that he was arrogant because of the, because of the state I was in.
[time=1887] I had come to a place where I was willing and ready to admit that I was utterly and absolutely
[time=1894] what?
[time=1897] Had I not been in that state?
[time=1902] I may have driven to France, I don't know, well, whatever's next to John, even though my geography, sorry.
[time=1906] I could have been in real bad shape, arrogant, I don't think so.
[time=1910] Narrow, narrow is a narrow.
[time=1915] Let me ask you a question, that night in the darkness of the German countryside when I find this 7/11 out in the middle of nowhere, when I walked in that door and approached that
[time=1926] counter and I saw that kind gentleman looking at me, do you think for a moment that I wanted to hear from him, do you think I wanted to hear options?
[time=1937] Do you?
[time=1939] Would you?
[time=1941] I hate my iPhone in that whenever I want to get somewhere and I hit the map thing and I punch in the route, it always gives me what?
[time=1950] I don't want options.
[time=1951] I just want you to tell me the shortest, quickest route there, just dial it in.
[time=1957] Don't give me options.
[time=1958] I need help here and I'm so thankful he didn't give me options when the, when the skyscrapers on fire, when you're on the 80th floor and the fires on the 40th floor and the windows closing rapidly for you to get down through a safe route to a life-saving exit and the
[time=1974] firefighter finally reaches your office.
[time=1978] Do you want him to say, okay gang, listen up, there's four things we could do here.
[time=1985] Do you?
[time=1986] Or do you want a narrow-minded savior who says, shut up, get behind me, go where I go, step
[time=1996] where I step and we might get out of here.
[time=1999] You ready?
[time=2000] Let's go.
[time=2001] Hey man.
[time=2002] I'll take that.
[time=2003] I'll take narrow any day when my life is on the line.
[time=2012] Prideful.
[time=2013] Ah, man, I don't know, prideful.
[time=2017] Was it prideful of him?
[time=2019] To say this to them, he was about to be horrifically beaten.
[time=2024] He's about to be unspeakably tortured and slowly murdered.
[time=2031] This statement is an uncommon, humble, unspeakable act of kindness.
[time=2038] He doesn't have to, he doesn't have to rescue you.
[time=2042] He doesn't have to, he doesn't have to redeem us, in fact, you killed him.
[time=2047] I, our sin killed him.
[time=2049] The disciples, sin is what he was dying for, for the very people who sin cost him his life.
[time=2057] He humbly in an uncommon and kind way says to them, hey, I don't want you to experience
[time=2064] what you will if you don't get this.
[time=2066] So please get this, I am the way, the truth and the life.
[time=2071] This thing's burning quick, it's about to tumble, shut up, get behind me, go where I
[time=2078] go, step where I step and we're going to get out of here.
[time=2083] We were toast and he lovingly offers us the only way home.
[time=2089] Lastly, third reminder for us this morning from John 14.6 and this is a plea.
[time=2099] This is those of us at Blackhawk who know him or who are fully surrendered to him.
[time=2107] This is our family, this is our leadership, this is me saying this to you, we are begging you.
[time=2113] Number three, to make sure that you, whoever you are, whatever the last few weeks have
[time=2120] looked like, whatever the last few months have entailed, whatever the last few years
[time=2127] have brought, we're begging you to make sure today that you're on the right road.
[time=2134] You get a chance to think this through and to make sure that you are on the right way.
[time=2142] There's a message in this little one verse, there's a message to the lost and it's as
[time=2148] if Jesus is saying to those of you on the outside looking in, how's it going?
[time=2154] So honestly, how is the journey?
[time=2159] You're good?
[time=2162] You got it, you got it all figured out?
[time=2167] The phone going, the radio going, just making turns, you're good or he says are you utterly
[time=2178] and completely ready to come to terms with the fact that you're lost?
[time=2188] There's a message in this verse for the lost, it's got three parts to it.
[time=2193] Listen, number one, acknowledge, he says, just acknowledge, acknowledge your need for and
[time=2199] commit to a new way, a new road, a new path.
[time=2206] It is an acknowledge, your need for and commit to a church building, it's not acknowledge
[time=2212] your need for and commit to religion, we're not about religion, we're going to commit and keep telling you that.
[time=2218] We're not about external do's and don'ts, we're not about the traditions of man.
[time=2225] This isn't a call for you to join some organization.
[time=2229] This is a call from the Lord Jesus Christ himself to join him because he's looking you
[time=2237] in the eye like he was Thomas and today he's saying, I am your way, I am the road you need
[time=2244] to be on, come what, come follow me, come follow me, acknowledge your need for and commit
[time=2253] to a new way, devote yourself to a new GPS, devote yourself to a new set of directions,
[time=2259] devote yourself to the perfect map quest, devote yourself to that which will allow you never ever ever ever to be lost, this, a new source, a reliable source of truth, don't
[time=2275] end up on the side of the road, don't end up in the ditch, in the dark wondering how in the world you got here and where in the world you're going to go next.
[time=2284] Now I'll see this is a chance today for you to acknowledge your need for and commit to a new way to devote yourself to a new source of true direction so that you might get to
[time=2295] live, so that you might get to experience life that is better than anything you could
[time=2303] have ever imagined, life that is as the Word of God says, life that is truly life, life
[time=2309] and him.
[time=2312] So before we sing again and lift our voices in praise to our God, I want to say this
[time=2319] last thing to you, there's a message in here for the lost, but did you ever stop and think
[time=2326] about it, who is he talking to?
[time=2334] Somebody say it, who is he talking to, who is asking the question, unsaved people far from God, pagans, yes or no, who asked the question, who is he talking to, he's talking
[time=2347] to the disciples people, before you leave this place thinking somehow the last 25 minutes
[time=2353] was just about lost people, understand my friends, you may have raised your hand one
[time=2361] day and you may have even walked an aisle, you may have fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ, but don't you for a second think that because you know him, you can't
[time=2372] find yourself in places where you are even as a believer on the wrong road, walking
[time=2384] a very wrong path, lacking even though it's right in front of you, lacking the true direction
[time=2396] that God designed for you, oh don't for a second Christian in the room, don't for a second
[time=2402] think that this this morning wasn't for you, because all how we can, all how we can find
[time=2409] ourselves lost.
[time=2414] And I hope and I pray that as we worship God this morning, I hope as we respond and song
[time=2420] to him as Chris and Sarah and the band lead us, I hope that you would be willing, those
[time=2426] of you far from God on the outside looking in, oh I pray that you would respond to the
[time=2433] Word and the Spirit of God this morning and admit to yourself that your sin has distanced
[time=2439] you from God, that you are not with him, you are not connected deeply to him and come
[time=2445] and let us pray with you while we sing, let us talk with you, let us encourage you, those
[time=2452] of you that know him, this is a window here, we got some more time and it's a great setting
[time=2459] for you to humbly and honestly say to him and you might even want to come and just share with us, I know the Lord, but make no mistake, Kelly I'm on the wrong road these days, I'm
[time=2475] heading the wrong direction, Frankfort's in my rear view mirror and I need to get turned
[time=2481] around and let us pray with you, let us encourage you as we sing, as we worship, as we proclaim
[time=2489] all that is right and true and good about Christ, our cornerstone, they rejected him,
[time=2499] we have not and so let's celebrate that, let's sing that and if anybody in the room, we've got elders, we've got staff people, they'll come down, we've got some women who would come down and pray I'm sure, but anybody in the room that wants to be prayed for, be prayed with, you come on down as we sing and worship our God.
[time=2533] Let us pray with you, let us pray with you, let us pray with you, let us pray with you
[time=2575] with you, Christ, our cornerstone, we've made sure and save his love through the storm,
[time=2596] he is a lord of hope, when darkness seems to hide his face, I mistorn his unchanging
[time=2618] veins, in every high and stormy cave, my servants within the land, shout it out because it's true,
[time=2634] Christ alone, cornerstone, he has made strong in the sense of love, through the storm,
[time=2657] he is a lord of hope, Christ alone,
[time=2683] cornerstone, we've made strong in the sense of love, through the storm, he is a lord of hope,
[time=2703] Christ alone, Christ alone, cornerstone, we've made strong in the sense of love, through the storm,
[time=2721] he is a lord of hope,
[time=2739] he is a god of troublesome, only other than me found, dressed in his love just now so long,
[time=2758] fondness to stand before the throne.
[time=2788] Christ alone, cornerstone, we've made strong in the sense of love, through the storm,
[time=2816] he is a lord of hope, Christ alone, cornerstone, we've made strong in the sense of love,
[time=2864] through the storm, he is a lord of hope.
[time=2894] He is a lord of hope, He is a lord of hope,
[time=2940] He is a lord of hope, He is a lord of hope, He is a lord of hope,
