[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] >> Well hello again everybody, welcome to the broadcast.
[time=33] It's great to have you with us as always.
[time=35] I look forward to these few minutes we get each and every week, and in these minutes we always would like to think that there's a chance for us to share with you things that are going on in our ministry, and even introduce you to people who are a part of that.
[time=48] And this morning I've got the privilege of having Luke Sefton.
[time=51] Hey bud, good to see you.
[time=52] This is Luke, he is our high school pastor.
[time=56] He oversees high school ministry, we call it 212.
[time=59] And 212 is something that means a great deal to us.
[time=63] We are extremely committed to the next generation of those who represent the future of the church, and I'm so thankful that Luke and his wife, Kelly, are part of our team.
[time=74] Luke, Blackhawk is not unfamiliar to you.
[time=78] You've been around Blackhawk for a while, haven't you?
[time=80] >> Yep, I started going to Blackhawk school in second grade.
[time=83] So I'm now 29, so there's been a lot of years that I've been exposed to Blackhawk.
[time=87] >> Quick, quick test, what year was that, second grade?
[time=90] >> 90, I don't know, 92.
[time=92] >> Early 90s, I got to have to think about that.
[time=95] >> So you've been around for a while.
[time=96] >> Yep.
[time=96] >> You've been around for a while, and kind of growing up around Blackhawk.
[time=101] And then you went off to college where?
[time=104] >> Grace College.
[time=106] >> Yep.
[time=106] >> And graduated in what year?
[time=108] >> 2007.
[time=109] >> 2007, all these years, you're doing good.
[time=112] And then 2007, you graduate, and eventually you end up back here on staff.
[time=117] >> Yep, tell me what that, tell the folks what that's like to have grown up here, and now you're serving in ministry.
[time=122] >> Yeah, it's really surreal, you know, to be back at the high school youth group that
[time=128] I went to, you know, when I was in high school.
[time=131] So since surreal, and then my wife, her dad used to be the pastor here, as you know.
[time=135] >> That's right, and that's the more.
[time=136] >> Yeah, an interesting thing for us.
[time=138] Just be back, it's home for us, so yeah, it's surreal at times, but it's really good.
[time=142] >> That's great, I knew Luke when he was younger, his wife, as you mentioned, Kelly, is Russell Moore's daughter, who was the pastor here, and one of my best friends for all of life, and it's great to have them both here serving and giving themselves to high school students in the way that they do.
[time=158] We call it 212, and high school ministry, Luke, as you know, is a pivotal, important time in the life of any young man or woman.
[time=167] Tell the folks just briefly what 212 is about, I mean, if you were really to talk about its purpose and the intent you have in your heart as you do that ministry, what's it really about for you?
[time=177] >> Well, just like our church, our intent is to make disciples of Jesus Christ, the disciples who are going to make disciples, and that idea of replication of really following Christ.
[time=187] And we have kind of a four-tiered approach, I won't really go through it all, but we basically,
[time=194] we want to turn kids into, we call them coaches, so we have a basketball analogy for what we're doing with our youth group, and eventually we want to turn those kids into coaches who are going to, again, teach the principles of Christ and make players out of their fellow
[time=209] students.
[time=210] >> That's great.
[time=212] And I think one thing I've seen over the years, and I'm so grateful for what Luke just said, I know, and he knows more than I do, how capable 17-year-olds are, how much potential 15 and
[time=224] 16-year-olds have to not actually take stuff in, but to actually give it back, to pass it
[time=230] along, and to replicate, and invest the truth they've been given into the lives of others.
[time=237] And so we're grateful that that's what's going on.
[time=239] In our high school ministry, I'm thankful for Luke, grateful for his place on our team.
[time=244] And I hope if you have any questions about high school ministry, you'll call us at the church number here at the bottom of the screen, we'll also put the 212 website at the bottom of the screen.
[time=253] If you have any questions at all, call Luke at the church office at any point in time.
[time=258] And we'd love to see your high school kids more and more part of what God's doing through 212.
[time=263] Hey, thank you for tuning in.
[time=265] As always, God bless you and have a great weekend.
[time=267] We hope to see you soon.
[time=288] [MUSIC]

[time=601] [MUSIC - 227 seconds]
[time=833] (guitar music) - Hey, open your Bibles.
[time=845] If you would this morning to John chapter 11, we continue in this series that we started a couple of weeks ago, we're calling it Jesus, according to who, say it, Jesus.
[time=854] We know that there's a lot of opinion about Jesus out there.
[time=858] We know that you can read things and listen to things.
[time=861] People have all kinds of perspective and thought on who Jesus was and what he did or didn't do.
[time=868] And we thought, you know what, let's just clear it all up.
[time=871] And let's just go to the source and let's spend all of August in the first week of September looking at the scriptures, namely the Gospel of John, and the statements that Jesus himself makes that define, that clarify, that give us insight into who he was, what he was like, what he stood for, the I ams of the Gospel of John, Jesus.
[time=894] According to Jesus, Josh Rang got us going a couple of weeks ago with I Am, the Vine.
[time=899] I had the privilege of teaching and being with you last week as we looked at the fact he is the only way, he is the only truth, he is the only source of life.
[time=910] I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[time=913] And today we come to John 11.
[time=915] I am, Jesus says, I am the resurrection.
[time=920] I am the resurrection and the life.
[time=924] I am about that which was dead, being made alive.
[time=930] I am about that which was lost, being found.
[time=936] I am about that which was broken, and depleted, and diminished, being made new and whole.
[time=944] I am the resurrection, he said, and the life, the resurrection.
[time=950] I don't know what comes to your mind.
[time=951] When you think about the resurrection, I'm not sure what picture gets painted in your head.
[time=956] When you hear me talk about Jesus being the resurrection, I do wanna tell you this, I heard it this past week, so powerful, so true.
[time=964] Somebody was talking about the first church.
[time=967] Somebody was talking about that first band of Christ followers in the book of Acts, who just months later after the crucifixion and the resurrection and the ascension began to boldly and courageously and incessantly and always and consistently stepped forward
[time=989] into their culture and their world, and with great strength and with great power, they made a difference in their world.
[time=996] And I was listening to this guy talk about the first church, and he said it this way, he said it was interesting, they didn't necessarily believe something was true.
[time=1005] See, we today, now all these years later, we get so excited about all that's true as we should, amen?
[time=1013] Because we have the privilege of having been provided with that which is true, and so we tend to get real focused on this which is okay, this guy's point was that that church in the early days, when they really didn't have all of this, their focus wasn't necessarily that which was true, they believed something had happened.
[time=1034] Let me say it differently, they knew something had happened.
[time=1042] They knew that someone who was dead,
[time=1051] they knew someone who predicted they would be dead, died and came back to life.
[time=1059] They knew my friends about the resurrection of Jesus
[time=1065] and it meant everything, and it changed everything.
[time=1070] I am the resurrection and the life.
[time=1075] We find this statement in John 11, this unbelievable story, I can't wait to share it with you this morning, many of you know it, for others of you it might be new, but would you in honor of God's word stand, and let me read these first 11 verses, first seven verses of John 11, we're going to read through most of the chapter, hey, just real quick, a lot of times in these settings, a message, a talk, we can do them different ways, oftentimes they're filled with anecdotes and stories that bring to light the truth of the scripture, and I think that's fantastic.
[time=1108] Sometimes I think what we need to do is read the text, sometimes what we need to do is read the word, sometimes we just need to kind of let what it says, guide us and teach us and encourage us, and this morning I want you to stay with me, we're going to read through a lot of this and every bit of it can be helpful to you, amen.
[time=1127] I hope you'll listen, I hope you'll stay with, I hope you'll just plug in here, John 11, here we go, first seven verses.
[time=1133] Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
[time=1141] It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, that Mary, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
[time=1151] So the sisters sent word to him, the Lord Jesus, saying, Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick, but when Jesus heard this, he said, the sickness is not to end in death, but for the glory of God so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.
[time=1172] Now look at this, now Jesus loved Martha, here we see my friends, the humanity of Christ, here we see the person of Christ, he loved Martha and her sister and he loved Lazarus.
[time=1186] And I love how the scripture, I love how it bounces off that, then in verse six, he loved him so much when he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days longer in the place that he was.
[time=1198] Love the way he thinks, I love the way he plans, I love the way he lets all this unfold.
[time=1205] So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he then stayed two days longer in the place where he was, then after this, after two days, he said to the disciples, let us go to Judea again.
[time=1219] Let's pray.
[time=1220] Our Father in Heaven as we open up your word again this morning, our Father in Heaven as we expose not only our hearts and our minds, but our very lives.
[time=1231] The reality, God, of where we live today, the way we've been living, the way we've been thinking, the way we've been choosing, oh God, from the youngest person here to the oldest and everyone in between, would your holy word and would your Holy Spirit be at work?
[time=1249] Move us and convict us, change us and remind us, God, of the things that we need to see, we pray.
[time=1256] And everybody agreed and said, amen.
[time=1259] You can have a seat and I'm gonna keep reading, please follow along, he tells the disciples in seven, let's go to Judea again.
[time=1267] I'm gonna pick it up in verse 11, in verse 11 it says, and after that, he said to them, Jesus turns to the disciples after that and says to them, our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go so that I may awaken him out of sleep, stop there, let me just say this to you, I can show you the place, this isn't the first time that he has spoken to them in this language, this isn't the first time that he's kind of illustrated death with sleep, but they like you, they like me, sometimes are a little what, say it slow.
[time=1305] So, he says, I go that I may awake him out of sleep, so the disciples, the sharp crew that they are, said to him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will wake up, he will recover.
[time=1318] Now, Jesus, you can kind of see him shaking his head.
[time=1321] Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought he was speaking of literal sleep, so Jesus said to them plainly, I like that, he says to them, plainly, Lazarus, hey guys, Lazarus is dead.
[time=1335] And I'm glad, I love verse 15, I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may go with me now on this trip, and what, believe, I'm glad, Jesus.
[time=1349] Okay, listen, Jesus talking to disciples
[time=1356] who have been with him for three years now, hearing everything he has said, watching him do everything he has done, taking in every miracle, watching every transformation.
[time=1368] And after three years, he says to them, just like he may say to you and to me at times, I'm glad I wasn't there.
[time=1378] I'm glad this worked out the way it did, because now I get to take you there so that you can believe, so that you can believe, but let us go to him.
[time=1394] And I just highlight that, because I know in my life after all these years, how about you, still to this day, there are these times when I don't believe,
[time=1409] when I'm just not, just not willing to admit again that he's that able, that I'm just not so sure that he's that strong, that I'm just not so sure, not that willing to step out on what feels like a really thin limb, not sure my obedience can go that far.
[time=1429] There's just these times where my belief truth be told, maybe like you, is just pathetically weak.
[time=1437] And I've seen so much, and I've learned so much, and I've stood here and said so much, and there's these times I think when you and I think, gosh, we should be so much better, we should be so much stronger, and yet Jesus says to them, and Jesus says to you this morning, come again, come with me again, I want you to watch what's gonna happen because I want you to believe.
[time=1469] And I hope this morning you're open to that very thing.
[time=1473] Look at verse 17, so when Jesus came, he found that he Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days, four days.
[time=1485] Now, Bethany was near Jerusalem about two miles off, and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them, I want you in your Bibles, I want you to take your pen, just go ahead and do it, it's okay, it really is.
[time=1496] God won't strike you dead, circle Jews right there, in verse 19, and many of the Jews had come to Martha
[time=1505] and Mary to console them, just circle Jews, we're gonna come back to that.
[time=1509] Martha, therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at the house, Martha then said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
[time=1523] Many people think that Martha is scolding him there, please understand, we don't believe that's the case at all, we believe this to be really a statement of faith.
[time=1533] We really believe this, not to be her scolding Jesus, we see this to be her simply stating what she believed would have been the obvious, that if Jesus had been there, surely he wouldn't have died, but he is dead, and Martha seems to have at least made some progress in coming to terms with this, even now I know, she says in 22 that whatever you ask of God, God will give you, Jesus said to her, your brother will rise again, what would that be like for you to be Martha, and to hear him say this to you, your brother will rise again, well she and her mind goes exactly where most in her case would, she said to her, she says, I know, Martha said to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day, because all the saints will rise again someday, she knew that, she believed that, so she said, well sure he'll rise at the end, but Jesus said to her, 11, 25, I am the resurrection and the life, he who believes in me will live even if he dies, and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die, do you believe this?
[time=1604] And I just want to ask you that this morning.
[time=1610] I just want to ask you if you believe down deep in your soul, the Lord just nudged me this morning, and I don't say this stuff often, but I'll just tell you this morning, God really nudged me, been thinking about this, writing this stuff down all week long up late last night, I woke up this morning, God just nudged me, and it just said to me, in kind of a quiet way, there's going to be people this morning that need, desperately need to hear this.
[time=1638] So I just want to ask you, do you believe that?
[time=1646] Do you believe that he is the resurrection and the life and whoever believes in him will live even if he dies?
[time=1655] And to everyone who lives and believes in Jesus will never die, do you believe this?
[time=1664] He said, and she said to him, yes, Lord, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, even he here, this is big, even he who comes into the world, which is you wouldn't know it just by reading him, but that's a messianic, that's a proclamation of his messiahship, he who comes into the world, she knew it, she believed it, it ran deep in her.
[time=1690] And then look at 32, she goes and tells Mary
[time=1696] that he's actually here, Mary makes her way to the Lord himself, and it says in 32, therefore when Mary came where Jesus was, she saw him, and fell at his feet saying to him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died again, we see that as a proclamation of his great power, a proclamation of her great trust and faith in him, when Jesus therefore saw her weeping, watch this, when Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled.
[time=1734] Again, the humanity of Christ, here we see the person of Christ, deeply moved in spirit and was troubled and said, where have you laid him?
[time=1744] And they said to him, Lord, come and see, and it says in 35, Jesus, what?
[time=1751] Jesus wept.
[time=1753] Jesus comes undone.
[time=1755] Jesus just comes unwound, he just starts weeping at the reality of this scene in all that is unfolding.
[time=1766] So the Jews were saying, see how he loved him, but some of them said, could not this man who opened the eyes of a blind man have kept this man also from dying, always a few skeptics.
[time=1779] So Jesus again being deeply moved within came to the tomb.
[time=1784] Now listen to the wording and just begin right now to think about what this must have been like for Jesus.
[time=1794] Listen to the wording, he says, deeply moved, he came to the tomb, now it was a cave and a stone had been rolled, a stone was lying against it and Jesus said in 39, remove the stone, roll it back.
[time=1811] Martha, the sister of the deceased said to him, Lord, Lord, whoa, whoa, by this time there will be a stench.
[time=1820] You know death, you know death stinks, right?
[time=1827] You know death really, really smells bad.
[time=1833] Lord, by this time there will be a stench where he has been dead.
[time=1837] How many days, church said four days and Jesus said to her, did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God.
[time=1849] So they removed the stone, they roll the stone away,
[time=1855] then Jesus raised his eyes and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
[time=1860] I knew that you always hear me, but because of the people standing here, I said it, said what?
[time=1868] Said verse 40, did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God.
[time=1875] I said it so that they may, what?
[time=1878] Say it, church, believe that you sent me.
[time=1882] When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
[time=1892] The man who had died came forth, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.
[time=1902] Jesus said to them, unbind him and let him go.
[time=1905] Here you go, therefore, verse 35, many of the who, many of the Jews who came to marry and saw what he had done believed in him.
[time=1917] Here's what I wanna say to you before we jump into this.
[time=1920] Here's what I wanna say to you about that.
[time=1922] Don't ever forget, my friends, how transformational it is for people when they see someone resurrected.
[time=1932] Don't ever forget how powerful it is for people
[time=1938] when they see someone who was dead be brought back to life.
[time=1943] Now, obviously, we're not spending a lot of time these days down at the cemetery.
[time=1950] It doesn't seem to be how God is working these days.
[time=1954] I'd be open to it, I'd be the first one there if that's what he wanted us to do.
[time=1958] Doesn't seem to be the way he's working these days, but make no mistake that we're not left out in the cold on this thing, because every single day, every single week in the body of Christ and the family of God, we get to be a part of transformational life change.
[time=1976] We get to see people brought back from the dead and made alive in Christ.
[time=1985] Don't ever forget, my friends, how powerful that is.
[time=1988] I can look around this room this morning.
[time=1992] I looked around this room first hour and I can look around this room second hour.
[time=1997] It's part of the benefit of 18, 19 years.
[time=2000] I see people in this room and there are some of you who are watching online and I know you and you were dead.
[time=2007] There are some of you in this room.
[time=2010] You were done, wrapped in the tomb.
[time=2015] You stunk, didn't you?
[time=2023] And now you don't because he resurrected you
[time=2030] because he saved you from your tomb and he brought you out to life and he has been growing you and he has been redeeming you and he has been setting you apart and I'm telling you, it is one of the most amazing things I ever get to experience and I'm so thankful that we serve a God whose son is, say it with me, the resurrection and the life.
[time=2056] All right, the resurrection of Lazarus, little history here for you, little backdrop, little insight, the resurrection of Lazarus is the climactic and most dramatic of all the miracles in the gospel of John and it's the culminating event of Jesus' public ministry.
[time=2074] Here in John 11, Jesus now literally stands in the shadow of the cross.
[time=2079] Did you know this?
[time=2080] His arrest, his beating and subsequent crucifixion is only four days away.
[time=2086] He's four days away from the beginning of the end.
[time=2092] I'll ask you again, you ever wonder why he wept?
[time=2095] Maybe you didn't know this, he's four days away.
[time=2100] Some people say he wept because he was just simply sad that Lazarus was dead, you know what?
[time=2105] He was no doubt saddened by the death of a man.
[time=2108] The text says he loved, absolutely.
[time=2111] But at the same time, he was also getting ready to raise Lazarus from the dead so he knew he wasn't gonna be dead long.
[time=2117] He's not crying just because Lazarus is dead.
[time=2121] Our Lord weeps because of the pain and destruction and a heartache of sin and he's four days away from feeling the unspeakable searing pain of all the world's sin, the weight of it, the overwhelming burden of it all begins to weigh him down.
[time=2138] He weeps, he's so sad that sin destroys.
[time=2143] He's so brokenhearted that sin leads to what?
[time=2148] Death and he's about to experience it himself.
[time=2152] And think about this, while six miracles had already occurred in the Gospel of John leading up to Lazarus here in chapter 11, the water had been turned into wine in John two, a healing of the royal official son in chapter four, the healing of the paralytic, what a story that was, chapter five, multiplying the loaves and the fishes, chapter six, walking on water in chapter six, curing the man born blind in John nine.
[time=2182] All of this has transpired, but Lazarus and his resurrection is more significant and more powerful than all of those.
[time=2189] And actually it's more monumental than the other two resurrections recorded in Luke, the widow's son in Luke seven and Jarius' daughter in Luke eight, because those two resurrections happened immediately, for the most part after they died, Lazarus' resurrection takes place 96 hours after its occurrence, decomposition, having already occurred.
[time=2217] So here's the three very important divine objectives I think you find here in this story.
[time=2224] The miracle of Lazarus' resurrection accomplishes three very important divine objectives.
[time=2233] This isn't just history folks, this is for you and I to understand and realize today, number one, here you go, it settled.
[time=2240] What happened here with Lazarus, we just read it, settles the deity, the deity debate.
[time=2247] You say, okay, what's the deity debate?
[time=2251] And I'm glad you asked.
[time=2252] I want you to understand the question.
[time=2254] The question on the deity debate is this, was Jesus God, was Jesus God in the flesh?
[time=2262] Was he the Messiah, the coming one?
[time=2266] Because you see, whether you were listening to him back then or whether you're here today considering his claims and maybe jumping in on this thing, whether you were listening to him then or listening to him now, the truth is what he says is astounding, the truth is what he says is a little mind-boggling, the truth is what he says is a little extreme, I am the only way, the only truth and only life, I am the only door in, I am the vine, if you're not with me, you're cut off, what he said my friends was bold, what he said was extreme and he's either God himself in the flesh, his claims are true, his word is right or he's a fraud.
[time=2312] Full of lies and you shouldn't trust a thing, he says or you shouldn't trust a thing I say for that matter, you might as well just get up and leave 'cause this is all a joke, if he's not God,
[time=2327] this is the deity debate.
[time=2330] You see from day one, Jesus had wanted his disciples, the Jews, the Gentiles to know that he was deity, that he and God were one, John 10.30, you can just flip back over a page or two, you'll see it, John 10.30, it says I and the father are what, say it, one, I am the father are one, he claims this, he states this, he proclaims this again and again and again and I want you to understand, here's a question for you, do you understand why this was so important to Jesus, why he pushes this issue?
[time=2368] Here's your answer because God alone, listen people, because God alone saves, everybody knew that.
[time=2377] God alone saves.
[time=2382] And if Jesus was God, then he was Messiah
[time=2388] and he could save and everything he said was true and guess what, watch this, beating death, I am the resurrection, beating death was the ultimate coup d'état, it was the ultimate trump card in the deity debate, nobody, no one prior to him or since him has ever possessed
[time=2411] that capacity to bring life out of death, no one has ever possessed that power.
[time=2417] And the Jews, this is what's so cool, the Jews back in 10, go back to 10.30, real quick, go back to 10.30, he said in 10.30, I and the father are one, well to the Jews, that was blasphemous, he's saying he's God.
[time=2432] And they picked up verse 31, the Jews picked up stones again to stone him, to kill him.
[time=2439] They wanted to murder him on the spot because he was claiming deity.
[time=2444] And many of them, in 11.45, I love this, 10.31,
[time=2450] they wanna kill him, look at 10, look at 11.45, therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what he had done, believed, believed in him.
[time=2461] They see him, they see Christ defeat death
[time=2467] and revive Lazarus and therein.
[time=2471] And my question to you is, wouldn't you be?
[time=2474] If you saw that, if you witnessed that, if you saw him roll a stone back and call a dead guy in clause 96 hours in the hole, out, and the guy comes out, wouldn't you?
[time=2491] So that really begs the question,
[time=2498] and I ask you, whoever you are, I ask you this lovingly, why haven't you?
[time=2504] What are you doing?
[time=2510] He's the resurrection, he's the life.
[time=2514] He did this, he did this for Lazarus,
[time=2521] and in about four or five, six days later, he did it again.
[time=2524] Why would you not believe?
[time=2529] Why would you not bow the knee of your heart and surrender yourself completely to this Lord and Savior?
[time=2541] Jesus says, I am the resurrection and the life.
[time=2546] You believe in me, you'll never die, because I'm deity.
[time=2550] He doesn't say it proudly or arrogantly.
[time=2552] He says it truthfully.
[time=2553] I am the authority here, not death, not the enemy me.
[time=2558] I'm in control, Andy Stanley, I heard Andy Stanley, pastor of a church down in Atlanta, say this at a conference slide, it was at the leadership summit actually, if a guy can predict both his own death and this, if a guy can predict both his own death and resurrection and then pulls it off, I'm with him, no matter what.
[time=2577] And I mean, I just want you to know, that's me, I'm in.
[time=2581] I'm with that guy, no matter what.
[time=2584] Jesus was divine, no doubt.
[time=2588] He calls a dead decomposed man out of the grave and Lazarus came forth, deity, debate done.
[time=2594] Secondly, the resurrection of Lazarus strengthened the disciples' faith.
[time=2600] It strengthens the faith of the disciples, write that down.
[time=2604] I know now, listen, I know they the disciples, I know they didn't show well, about four days later.
[time=2613] I know, I know everything just went crazy in Jerusalem.
[time=2617] I know Jesus gets arrested, I know, they didn't do too well on that night.
[time=2624] I get it, but all they did well in the days to come.
[time=2629] All how they stepped forward, all how they lived by faith.
[time=2636] I'm telling you, believe me, church, believe me in the bigger scheme in the larger picture when their own lives are at stake later, when the kingdom stakes just get higher and higher, when Jesus says go into the world and make disciples and build my church and when the world starts to turn on them and it gets really clear, really fast that they're going to lose their lives in this effort to save others and they did, they all died.
[time=2664] They all got killed doing what they were doing
[time=2670] when they realized that, when they saw that coming.
[time=2673] Believe me, it was the strength of a faith,
[time=2679] a faith that was fortified one day in a place called Bethany, when they stood there and watched their Lord roll a stone back and call a dead man out, it was in times like that.
[time=2692] It was in settings like with Lazarus and Mary and Martha
[time=2698] where the depths of their faith were strengthened and solidified and I would encourage you this morning, disciples, followers of Christ in this room, I would encourage you to look around your life.
[time=2713] Like I said earlier, I can look around this room and I want you to know my faith is strengthened.
[time=2720] Every week I look around this room and I've been here long enough to know that there are marriages in this room.
[time=2727] I can look at marriages in this room right now and you were dead in the water, you were wrapped up,
[time=2738] you were stuck in the tomb and it didn't smell good at all and I've watched God revive you.
[time=2745] I've seen God move in your home and in your relationship and in your family and you're here today and by all accounts you shouldn't be but you met the resurrection and the life and when I see it, when I see you here each week, my faith gets strengthened.
[time=2767] There's individuals in this room and you shouldn't be here.
[time=2770] By all accounts from a human perspective you should not be here but you are because you met the resurrection and the life and he transformed you and he changed you and he brought you to a new way and it strengthens my faith.
[time=2786] It was once said of the disciples, they feared not the words of man for they knew they possessed the word of life.
[time=2794] They feared not the hatred of man for they possessed the very love of God.
[time=2800] They feared not the sword of man nor its death for they had known, say it with me church, the resurrection and the life.
[time=2807] Lastly, it paved the way.
[time=2810] I'll ask Adam to come on up.
[time=2812] We're gonna sing one last song and I hope you'll sing it from your heart today.
[time=2815] Lastly, it paved the way for Jesus to go to the cross.
[time=2819] What do I mean by that?
[time=2822] Paved the way, the resurrection of Lazarus paves the way for Jesus to go to the cross.
[time=2828] Let me ask you this.
[time=2829] How do you think it felt for Jesus to see a stone rolled away?
[time=2835] Honestly, how do you think it felt?
[time=2839] And yes, I'm asking you to consider Jesus' feelings because don't forget he had them.
[time=2846] How do you think it felt to him four days prior to walking into what he knew he would face?
[time=2855] And he knew everything that was coming.
[time=2856] He knew every blow that would be delivered.
[time=2858] He knew every stripe across his back.
[time=2861] He knew every bit of blood that would be spilled.
[time=2863] How do you think it felt to Jesus?
[time=2866] There in Bethany, to see a stone rolled away and a dead man walk out of a tomb alive.
[time=2872] I think it helped.
[time=2874] I think it visually and literally eased his fears.
[time=2878] I, he knew Martha was right.
[time=2880] God could and would raise him from the dead.
[time=2885] And he knew in that moment, the hope of all mankind.
[time=2888] The hope of all mankind would live again.
[time=2892] And I wonder if the experience of Lazarus
[time=2898] didn't just give him the strength and the courage he needed to walk into Jerusalem and face all that he would face.
[time=2904] I hope it gives you the strength that you need.
[time=2909] 'Cause that's who he is.
[time=2910] He is about resurrecting that which is dead.
[time=2913] He's about life, life that is truly life.
[time=2917] And he is our Lord.
[time=2918] Let's worship him.
[time=2919] Would you stand and let's sing together as we go today?
