[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] >> Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=36] It's great to have you with us and I'm thankful for these moments that we can share together.
[time=41] As we speak here today, the end of August, amazing that the summer is about over and
[time=47] September's coming and with September comes the beginning of a lot of things.
[time=52] It's really sort of the second New Year's celebration for most of us in the routines of our life and at Black Hawk, there's no exception.
[time=61] This is the beginning of a number of things that are new and we believe engaging and important.
[time=68] And I want to make sure that you know about that.
[time=70] Many of you are a part of our broadcast family.
[time=72] You watch every week.
[time=74] You may even come periodically, but our hope and our desire is that as part of our family, you would come on campus and experience some of these things in a way that might really capture your attention and your heart and would give us a chance to get to know you better.
[time=90] Here's a couple of things I've got in mind.
[time=92] First of all, on Wednesday nights, beginning September 12th, there's a whole new semester of Lagos Institute of Biblical Studies.
[time=101] It's a $5 a night class, that's it.
[time=104] And it is high level, like seminary type level, Bible college teaching on
[time=110] doctrine and theology and the life of Christ and electives, like spiritual gifts and the armor of God.
[time=117] It is an amazing program serving not only the Black Hawk family, but it's a regional offering.
[time=123] We're in a number of different places.
[time=125] Rod and Carolyn Obit lead our Lagos Institute of Biblical Studies effort.
[time=130] And Wednesday nights is the night that they're here at Black Hawk.
[time=134] And we would love for you, six o'clock and seven thirty.
[time=137] We would love for you to come this September 12th and jump into a life changing.
[time=142] I'm telling you a transformative experience as you better understand the great truths of God's Word.
[time=149] Also on September 8th, Sunday morning, we kick off a brand new fall series called Vision.
[time=154] This would be a chance for you to kind of understand and see the vision that we have for this amazing community of people that God has given us the privilege of doing ministry with.
[time=166] This Black Hawk community, this ministry that God's given us, it really does have some very specific aims and some very specific, exciting purposes.
[time=176] And I can't wait to share those with you over the first three weeks of September.
[time=181] September 8th is our kickoff.
[time=183] I hope you'll come and be with us in the room on those Sundays in September.
[time=187] It's going to be, I think, a very compelling time and one that you won't want to miss.
[time=193] And I also want to just remind you that with September and August comes the beginning of school and I know school has started.
[time=199] But I can't stop talking about Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=203] From Pre-K all the way through high school, we offer not only kids but families an opportunity to be grown and stretched and grounded in their faith.
[time=214] We give kids an opportunity to excel at an academic level that's incredibly encouraging, I'm so thankful for the work we've done on the academic side.
[time=223] And it also gives you the chance to live within the confines of a family.
[time=227] That really cares for your progress as a student and your life as a family.
[time=232] So come by the office sometime, think about, pray about maybe your kids being a part of the Black Hawk Christian School family.
[time=239] We'd love to get to know you better.
[time=240] We'd love to help you in that direction.
[time=243] Hey, thank you for tuning in today.
[time=245] We continue in our series, Jesus According to Jesus.
[time=248] Today we're gonna have a wonderful time of worship and then we're gonna look at John chapter 10 and the statement Jesus made where he said I am the good shepherd and oh how we need you and I, both a good shepherd.
[time=262] Hey, thank you for tuning in.
[time=264] God bless you and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=266] He will never leave us, God is for us, He has open arms, He will never fail us.
[time=279] He will never fail us, He lifted us to feed in the grave.
[time=288] Praise to life, our God is able in His name, we overcome before the Lord.
[time=303] Our God is able, lifted up, He defeated the grave, praise to life, our God is able.
[time=317] His name, we overcome before the Lord, our God is able, before the Lord, our God is able.
[time=337] Oh, Lord, our God is able.
[time=351] My foes are many, their eyes against me but I will hold my ground.
[time=379] I will not feel the storm, my help is on the way, my help is on the way.
[time=392] Oh, my God, He will not delay, my refuge and strength always.
[time=405] I will not fear, His promise is true, my God will come through always, always.
[time=422] I will not feel the storm, my help is on the way.
[time=449] My help is on the way, oh, my God, He will not delay, my refuge and strength always.
[time=467] I will not feel, His promise is true, my God will come through always, always.
[time=484] Lift your eyes up, I lift my eyes up, my help is on the way.
[time=494] I lift my eyes up, my help comes from the Lord.
[time=532] Oh, my God, He will not delay, my refuge and strength always.
[time=555] I will not feel, His promise is true, my God will come through always.
[time=565] I lift my eyes, I lift my eyes up, my help comes from the Lord.
[time=615] See you one more time, I lift my eyes up.
[time=619] I lift my eyes up, my help comes from the Lord.
[time=631] Hey, open your Bibles, if you would this morning to John chapter 10, we come back to our series, Jesus, according to Jesus, there's a lot of opinions out there about Jesus.
[time=642] A lot of people have a lot of different things to say about Jesus, and we thought we'd just come right back to the source himself and John, in the Gospel of John, he says on a number of occasions, I am, boom, and he fills in the blank, and we have had a great four or five
[time=657] weeks filling in the blanks, and we come this morning to this phrase in John chapter 10
[time=663] verse 11 regarding him being the good shepherd.
[time=667] Let me read this to you, it says right there in John 10, 11, it says I am the good shepherd.
[time=674] The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep, and as we start this morning, I want
[time=681] to just ask you a question, and I want you to actually just take a minute and talk about it with somebody next to you, if that someone next to you is a family member or a good friend,
[time=690] fantastic, if that someone next to you is a stranger, here we go, we're breaking down walls and getting to know each other, right?
[time=696] Here's the question, when you hear the word of God say, and when you hear me articulate
[time=702] this morning, this idea of Jesus being a good shepherd, Jesus says I am the good shepherd,
[time=709] and I know nobody in this room is really an expert on shepherding, sheep and guys with
[time=715] sticks and mountains and rivers and valleys, but you're also bright enough I think to think
[time=721] this one through, what did a shepherd do?
[time=726] What made a shepherd a good shepherd?
[time=730] What would make a shepherd responsible for a flock of sheep?
[time=735] What kinds of things would they do, just articulate maybe two, three or four things, a good shepherd
[time=741] caring for a flock of sheep, if he was a good shepherd, he'd be really good at, what?
[time=749] Talk about it, go ahead, just talk to somebody next to you, let me hear your voices, move over, scoot across the aisle if you have to, just talk to somebody, if you're up for it, what does a good shepherd do, there you go.
[time=763] Maybe it's one word, maybe it's just a phrase, good job, good job, keep talking, come up
[time=776] with a couple, you kids, you kids in the room, come on, you can help us, think of something
[time=784] that a good shepherd would be really good at as he cared for his sheep, alright, alright,
[time=792] so we're going to do this, it's just like school, come on, somebody with a real loud
[time=798] voice will go with loud voice rather than big mouth, how's that?
[time=804] Somebody with a real loud voice, just a hand up, let me just see, just something that you came up with, a good shepherd knows his own sheep, he knows them, he knows their tendencies,
[time=815] he knows what they look like, because that's how he knows they're his, great, he knows
[time=821] his own, somebody else, hand up, yeah, I'm the very back, Vanessa, finding lost sheep
[time=827] because sheep tend to what, wander, they tend to get lost, we all know sheep are stupid,
[time=835] they really are, I'm not knocking sheep, they're just dumb and they tend to walk away from
[time=841] where they're supposed to be in a good shepherd, he sees that, he goes after him, he brings him back, good, hands up in the back, back in the very back, Michael, he feeds them, amen,
[time=855] well done Michael, a good shepherd feeds his sheep, a good shepherd knows when they're hungry, a good shepherd knows what to feed them, Michael next to you as a gentleman, yes,
[time=867] he protects them because sheep are in danger, because there's these things called wolves that want to eat them and so the shepherd knows how to take care of them, these are wonderful
[time=879] accurate answers, hang on to this, he knows them, he protects them, he feeds them, he goes
[time=885] after them, very, very well done, the great truth, the great truth and you just articulated
[time=894] it, the great truth of John 11 and Jesus wanting you to know that he is your, he is our good
[time=900] shepherd, really has its roots, the really good news about verse 11, really has its roots
[time=907] one verse earlier, my friends, while there is much to say about the sheer goodness of
[time=915] his shepherding or his care, what causes the great truth of that verse, that statement
[time=921] to jump off the page is the great darkness and despair, the great danger of the statement
[time=928] made just prior in verse 10 where it says, and you can see it right there in your own Bible, John 10 10, the thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy, did you know where
[time=946] you aware of the fact that those two verses were back to back, they are, and in being
[time=953] back to back they paint a wonderful picture, they paint a compelling picture, they paint
[time=961] a picture we need to look at this morning and as dark and as hard as it is to look at Satan, I want you just briefly this morning to look at this statement with me, the thief,
[time=974] the enemy himself comes only to steal and kill and destroy, I want us to be reminded
[time=982] here in these moments together my friends of the truth about Satan, I'll say that again I really do for a moment want you to be reminded about the truth regarding Satan, I want you
[time=996] to see again the very real intent and purpose behind this very real being and his very real
[time=1003] every moment of every day activity toward you.
[time=1010] The scriptures say this morning to us that he comes to steal, to kill and destroy and before we jump into this just by way of introduction I do want to remind you of what it says in
[time=1021] verse 10, if you have your Bibles or your iPads or your iPhones, however it is you're following along, I want every one of you that can to look with me at verse 10, I just want you to see this one word before we go any further, John 10 10, the thief comes and what's
[time=1038] your version say, only, I just want to remind you this morning that it's the only reason
[time=1050] he comes, his only purpose, his only endeavor, his only goal, the only thing that Satan is
[time=1061] about in the every day of your life in mind is he wants to steal, he wants to kill and
[time=1068] he wants to destroy and that's it and I'm going to ask you this morning to just take
[time=1077] a few moments here in the quietness of this room and hopefully the sincerity and honesty of your own heart will you, will you think some of these things through with me, will you ask yourself some honest questions, will you allow the reality of your life be it
[time=1092] your past, present or even your future, to come into contact with the truth of God's
[time=1099] Word here this morning as he talks to you, as he proclaims to you the intention of the evil one, let's start with that first one, would you just write down steal, he comes
[time=1111] to write it down, he comes to steal and I want you to write this next to, next to he
[time=1118] comes to steal, just write this down, write down sin, steals, I know I said he comes to
[time=1127] steal but please understand the activity of Satan is all about what, sin and I just want
[time=1133] you to write this down, sin steals, what do I mean by that, well you know what
[time=1141] sin steals, sin steals time doesn't it, sin, think about this, sin steals sometimes weeks,
[time=1155] months, sin steals years, it has a way, it has that capacity, sin steals time, it steals
[time=1168] opportunity, sin steals trust, it steals relationship doesn't it, nod your head if you know that
[time=1176] to be true, it steals trust, it steals relationship, sin steals love, it steals, it takes away,
[time=1185] it steals reputation and a good name, it does, sin clouds our past while it steals our futures,
[time=1196] it can steal our dreams, it can steal our potential, it can steal our ability, it steals
[time=1204] minds, it steals souls, sin steals our joy, sin is a sin is a heartless thief and I wonder
[time=1217] if you would just for a moment again in the quietness and honesty of your own, your own soul and I wonder if you might even just write it down, I know it would probably be something
[time=1228] that you'd want to be private so you'd do it however you want but I wonder if you might just think for a moment honestly about what it has stolen in your life, I wonder if you
[time=1242] would just think right now for just a moment about what sin has taken away what it's stolen
[time=1253] from you, young people can answer this question, older people can make a list, go ahead just
[time=1264] maybe mentally or literally write a few things down because I'm telling you sin is a thief
[time=1274] and it steals.
[time=1276] The Bible says the scriptures teach us this morning that sin also kills, I hope you'll write that down, sin kills, both the outcome, you'll see this in your digging deeper, I hope
[time=1289] that you'll take digging deeper this week, it's available for you there in the bulletin, it's also available online, I want you to look with me turn in your Bibles or go on your
[time=1300] iPads or whatever device you've got, go to Romans 5, I want you to see that the outcome,
[time=1306] the outcome of sin and the wages of sin, it says in 5, 12, it says therefore in Romans
[time=1320] 5, 12 it says therefore just as through one man sin entered into the world, that would
[time=1326] be Adam and Eve and death through sin and so death spread to all men because all sin,
[time=1338] the outcome of sin is death and you go over just a page or two and it says in Romans 6,
[time=1345] 23 that the wages, you see it there, 6, 23 it says for the wages, what you get, what you
[time=1352] earn, what comes your way, the wages of sin is death, the wages of sin is death, take your
[time=1360] digging deeper home my friends, use it personally, use it as a family, sin kills, it literally
[time=1368] can and has left to run its course taken lives, you know this right, you've seen this, this
[time=1375] isn't new news to so many of you I know sin leads to killing, sin leads to death, it leads
[time=1382] to the loss of life, sin also has the capacity to kill hope, I've seen that, I have set with
[time=1390] hopeless people whose hope has been killed by the devastation of sin, oftentimes ongoing
[time=1398] it kills freedom, it kills faith, allowed to live and breathe and grow and I say it like
[time=1406] that because sin really is, it's like a living thing and when you give it air and when you
[time=1412] give it water and when you give it a place to grow it will what grow and allowed to live
[time=1420] and breathe and grow, it kills your vision, people overwhelmed by sin don't see straight,
[time=1430] they don't see what they should see, they don't see what's there, it kills their ability to see what's true, it kills their ability to see what's right, it kills their ability to
[time=1440] see what's good, it's all gone, it's all muddy, it's all foggy, it's all up for grabs because
[time=1446] sin has a way of killing things, your vision and your discernment and your wisdom being
[time=1452] just a few, sin is, somebody said sin is homicidal and it is, it'll kill you, it is cold blooded,
[time=1463] it's a murderer and I wonder what it's murdered, again just for you to think through, just
[time=1469] for you and I to contemplate, I wonder what it has killed in you, would you think about
[time=1478] that just for a moment, I wonder what has died in you because of sin choices that you
[time=1490] continue to make, roads that you keep going down, patterns that you keep living in, I wonder
[time=1497] what's died, it's what sin does, sin steals and sin kills and it says to us in the scriptures
[time=1507] this morning that sin destroys, write that down, you got space there in your bulletin
[time=1513] or you may have your own notebook, sin destroys and as we've just, in the last five minutes
[time=1521] as we've just described, sin obviously can destroy a great deal, it can obviously destroy
[time=1529] a great deal in you and a great deal in me but mostly I want you to see this morning but as it clearly destroys people and their lives and their futures and their homes and their
[time=1539] relationships it also, it also, sin does, it destroys and diminishes other people's view
[time=1546] of God, I want you to see this this morning, I want you to write this down, I want you to focus on this just for a moment, sin destroys, it diminishes other people's view of God,
[time=1558] you say how, let me just think this through with me, please understand this, as much as Satan hates you and you know he hates you, right, as much as he hates you and wants to
[time=1568] ruin your life and your future, he hates God more and one of the ways he tries to strike
[time=1575] at God is by dismantling those who proclaim their love and devotion to God, you proclaim
[time=1582] your love and devotion to God, one of the great things while the Bible says the only thing he's here to do is to steal, kill and destroy you so your supposed love and devotion
[time=1592] to God gets dismantled and in the process God's name and God's reputation and God's fame
[time=1599] get dismantled, because when the one who's love and devotion to God, when that person
[time=1608] caves into the efforts of the evil one, a skeptical and on-looking world says I knew
[time=1614] it, a skeptical and on-looking world says he's a fraud, his faith is a fraud and his
[time=1620] God is a fraud, this is exactly what the enemy's after, it is exactly what the enemy
[time=1626] was after, if I said to you and I'm not trying to make anybody feel dumb, so please don't
[time=1633] go there, so when I say this, can you think of a name from the Old Testament and you may
[time=1640] not know the Old Testament, no big deal, hang around and we'll get you there, can you think of a name in the Old Testament of a guy who Satan came to and Satan's desire with this
[time=1657] guy was to steal, was to kill, and was to destroy, because Satan believed if he could
[time=1666] steal, kill and destroy this guy that this guy would turn on God, that if he could get
[time=1673] to this guy, this guy's faith and this guy's witness, it would all go down in a heap if
[time=1679] he could absolutely just riddle this guy with the pain and the heartache and the tragedy
[time=1685] of sin, that guy's name would be what, Job.
[time=1691] That's exactly what Satan tried to do with Job, got allowed, got allowed there to be
[time=1701] this trial in Job's life.
[time=1705] His children were killed, his property was destroyed, his herds, his herds by the hundreds
[time=1712] of thousands were killed, his wealth was completely dismantled, his health was gone, the whole debacle was Satan trying to steal, kill and destroy Job and the name of God was Satan,
[time=1724] this is exactly what he tries to do, this is exactly what that destruction is about.
[time=1731] He tries to destroy you and the reputation of your God.
[time=1736] I saw this in Digging Deeper as well, we studied it just a few months ago, back in the back
[time=1742] of your New Testament we went through the book of 1 John, let me just read this to you, it says in 1 John 3 8, listen to what it says, it says in 1 John 3 8, it says the one
[time=1752] who practices sin is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning, the son of God appeared for this to destroy the son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy
[time=1763] the works of the devil, the trouble is trying to destroy the works of God, but my friend's
[time=1770] the great and good news is that the son of God came to destroy him, amen?
[time=1778] Satan is indeed all that we've said and he does.
[time=1785] In many cases accomplish all that we just talked through and before we go I just have to say this, before we go further we've got to say this to you, I want to make sure that
[time=1796] everybody in this room understands that I know very well what he has stolen from you,
[time=1806] I understand that scene, I know many of those realities, I know what it looks like in your
[time=1816] life when you start to think about what he has killed, I know the darkness, I know the
[time=1822] despair, I know the grief, I know the remorse, I understand where your mind goes when you
[time=1828] begin to think about your life in these last 10 years or these last 20 years, these last 30 years and all that he has destroyed.
[time=1837] I know from many of you in this room that it's difficult to even be asked to think about
[time=1844] what has gone on and what has transpired and as hard as that is, I want to say equally
[time=1851] with great joy and with great enthusiasm, I want to tell you this, I want to be the messenger of good news to you again that everything that you thought of in those last 10, 15 minutes,
[time=1863] everything that has been stolen and everything that has been killed and all that has been
[time=1869] destroyed can be redeemed, all of it.
[time=1877] The word redeemed means to be made what, new and whoever you are, whatever you've done,
[time=1884] however long you've traveled that road, the good news of the gospel and the good news that this church and our ministry is so grateful to be able to proclaim is that he can redeem
[time=1897] it all and he can protect you from it because he is next verse, say amen if you're thankful
[time=1905] for verse 11, he is the good shepherd.
[time=1909] Let's look at this, 11 through 16, 11 through 16, I'll leave you seated this morning but
[time=1915] I'll just know in your hearts you're standing to honor, how's that, 11 through 16, I want you to see this with me, I am the good shepherd, he says, and as I read through this, I want
[time=1925] you to go back to our little exercise at the beginning, see if as I read through this, you can't pick up some things that seem to be characteristic of him being a good shepherd
[time=1937] as I read through verses 11 to 16, I am the good shepherd, the good shepherd lays down in his life for the sheep, there's one, he who is a hired hand and not a shepherd who
[time=1949] is not the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flea fleas
[time=1955] and the wolf snatches them and scatters them, he fleas the hired hand because he is a hired
[time=1961] hand and is not concerned about the sheep, I am the good shepherd, verse 14 and I know
[time=1967] my own and my own know me, even as the father knows me and I know the father and I lay down
[time=1974] my life for the sheep, I have verse 16, I have other sheep which are not of this fold,
[time=1982] I must bring them also and they will hear my voice and they will become one flock with
[time=1990] one shepherd, that's me, his shepherding is sacrificial, verse 11, his shepherding is
[time=1997] personal, verses 12 and 13, his shepherding is intimate, verse 14 and his shepherding is
[time=2004] inclusive, verse 16, let's just look at those in these next few minutes, let's start with verse 11 where it says the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep, I hope you will
[time=2016] write this down, his shepherding is sacrificial, now first of all in this discussion of the
[time=2022] sacrificial nature of his shepherding we have to establish something, he is the good shepherd,
[time=2030] he is laying down his life, none of this really carries the full weight or really conveys the
[time=2036] full force of what's actually transpiring here in this statement unless we establish
[time=2042] unless we remember who we're talking about, for you to really understand the power of
[time=2050] this statement that he lays down his life for you, you have to understand who he is,
[time=2059] he is Jesus Christ, he is the Messiah, he is the Son of God, God himself in the flesh,
[time=2067] all powerful, almighty, all sufficient, he already had, this is John 10 back at the beginning
[time=2073] of John, he had already done battle with Satan in the wilderness, remember that, all those
[time=2080] days and nights he experienced the full gamut of the devil's temptations and enticements
[time=2086] and he won that battle, he won it decisively, didn't even blink, didn't falter once and
[time=2095] with the victory secured for us those who follow him have access to that very same strength
[time=2102] and victory, so when it says with reference to his shepherding care and protection, when
[time=2109] it says he lays down his life for us, it's the most powerful of sacrifices, it's the
[time=2115] most dynamic of sacrifices, the most far reaching, the strongest, surest of sacrifices because
[time=2122] it's him sacrificing for you, Satan can't steal, kill or destroy you because guess why?
[time=2132] Because he couldn't steal, kill or destroy Jesus, Jesus lays down his life, he is the
[time=2142] good shepherd, he lays it down to protect you and he takes it back up, look at verse 18, go to John 10 where we were, if you go down to 18 I love this verse, no one has taken it, he's speaking here of his life, no one has taken it away from me but I lay it down
[time=2159] on my own initiative, I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it
[time=2166] up again, Jesus lays down his life to protect you and he takes it back up, his life endures
[time=2174] to secure you all because of his sacrificial care, the greatest care because it's the greatest
[time=2182] sacrifice of all time, that's who you want to be cared for, buy, that's the kind of strength
[time=2189] and power you want watching over you, the one who beat him, the one who cleaned his clock,
[time=2196] the one who defeated death and the author of it, his shepherding right this down, number
[time=2202] two his shepherding is personal, his shepherding is personal, here we go back to the whole
[time=2208] discussion with the hired hand, he was a hired hand and not a shepherd, so it just tells
[time=2214] you right there those two aren't the same, a hired hand is a guy who took care of sheep for wage, this is a bus boy, this is a guy working his way through shepherding school,
[time=2225] I don't know, this is just somebody looking for a few extra bucks and somebody who's just looking for a few extra bucks when it gets right down to it and the wolves are closing
[time=2236] in he's like wow my shift is over, but not a shepherd because a shepherd doesn't do shepherding
[time=2246] for wage, a shepherd does shepherding because those are his sheep, he owns them, there is
[time=2260] because they're his, he's walked with them and he helped birth them and when they got
[time=2267] old and died he was there and when they wandered away he brought him back and he does know
[time=2273] him by name because they're his and when you're when you're gonna mess with what's
[time=2279] mine, news flash, don't mess with what's mine, the shepherd says and that's what, that's
[time=2292] what Jesus is saying here, it's personal, I think about the shepherding responsibility
[time=2300] God has given us as elders here at Blackhawk, I think about the way our staff looks at our
[time=2306] shepherding role with many of you and while I can speak for me many of them would speak
[time=2313] for themselves, I look around this room first hour, second hour, I see hundreds, hundreds of people who I know after 18, 19 years, I think back on the times that many of us have
[time=2326] stood by a grave.
[time=2328] I think back on many a time that I've taken a drive to a hospital to celebrate a new life.
[time=2338] I think about the times that I've sat with many of you in living rooms, I think about the times I've sat with many of you in my office, I think about the times our families have been together, I think about the joys and the sorrows, I think about the gains and the losses, I think about all that we have seen, I think about your kids, I think about the days where it couldn't have gotten any better and I think about those nights when it couldn't have been any worse and I'm here to tell you that for myself, for those who elder and care for you, for those on this staff, we don't do this for wage.
[time=2372] We do this because God has called us to care for and love those who are ours and we don't
[time=2380] match up in any way, shape or form to him, but it's the picture that I know we use, it's
[time=2388] the model that I know we're after.
[time=2391] And I tell you, I look around this room and I think about a wolf, I think about wolves
[time=2397] coming near you and I think, wow, I could, I was thinking about first hour, I could actually,
[time=2405] I could hurt somebody, I mean, I could actually, we would actually get after it, I think of
[time=2411] you that deeply, we care for you that much, we would protect you and we would do our very
[time=2417] best to care for you.
[time=2419] And that's exactly what Jesus is saying here, his shepherding is personal.
[time=2429] As you read through 11 to 16, you also see that his shepherding is intimate.
[time=2435] Look with me if you would have verse 14.
[time=2442] Verse 14, John 10 simply says, "I am the good shepherd and I know my own and my own no me."
[time=2452] I know my own and my own no me.
[time=2458] I can't tell you, after all these years of doing what I get to do with my days, of being
[time=2464] in ministry and for so many years being here, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt how much
[time=2471] it means.
[time=2472] And this is a great joy and it's also a great heartache sometimes because I'm so not good at this sometimes, but I know for a fact how nice it is when I am walking through a hallway
[time=2485] here or I'm in the parking lot or I'm at Kroger and one of you walks by and I call you by
[time=2491] your name.
[time=2496] And I try.
[time=2498] I like to say I'm no Rick Hawks, but there are people who are just hyper gifted at that and I'm not one of them, but I'm telling you I know how important it is.
[time=2509] I know how much I like it when somebody who I love and trust or respect and admire calls
[time=2516] me by my name.
[time=2518] And so we're trying around here to call you by your name.
[time=2521] We're trying to and you don't do that unless you're close, you don't do that unless you spend time together, you don't do that unless you talk, you don't do that unless you sort of roll up your sleeves and live a little bit of life together.
[time=2533] And this is the picture that Jesus paints of this shepherd.
[time=2536] He knows his sheep.
[time=2538] He's with them.
[time=2539] He walks with them.
[time=2540] He sleeps with them.
[time=2541] He feeds them.
[time=2542] He's there in the midst of the everyday of their life.
[time=2545] It's the kind of shepherd you have in him and he does it perfectly and he's sacrificial.
[time=2554] That's true.
[time=2556] He is personal and the personal side even goes to an intimate side.
[time=2560] I love what it says later in this passage.
[time=2563] We'll see it in just a moment.
[time=2564] I love what it says in other gospel texts.
[time=2568] It talks about how the sheep in the same discussion about shepherding, it'll say it says in a number of places that the sheep knew the shepherds what?
[time=2577] Voice.
[time=2578] I love that.
[time=2581] Think about the voices that you know.
[time=2586] Think about the phone calls that you can have.
[time=2589] Think about saying hello and hearing another voice and think about the times where it
[time=2595] just, you know, there's like three or four or five people maybe in your life and you just hear a word and you know exactly who it is because you know them and they know you
[time=2606] and there is that intimacy and that is the kind of love and that is the kind of care and that is the level of love and care that Christ provides.
[time=2614] It's sacrificial.
[time=2615] It's personal.
[time=2616] It's intimate and lastly it's inclusive.
[time=2622] It's inclusive.
[time=2623] Look at verse 16.
[time=2624] Oh, I'm so glad this is last.
[time=2626] I'm so glad we've got just a couple minutes here to think about this and consider this.
[time=2631] Oh, he, oh, how he loves his sheep, right?
[time=2634] Oh, how he loved his people.
[time=2635] Oh, how he loved those that he was caring for.
[time=2639] But look what it says in 16.
[time=2640] It says I have other sheep.
[time=2645] He's looking at, he's looking at them saying, hey, you're not the only deal in town.
[time=2650] There are others who I want to be sacrificial, personal and intimate with.
[time=2656] I have other sheep which are not of this fold.
[time=2660] I must bring them also and when I do, they will hear my voice and they will become one
[time=2668] flock with one shepherd.
[time=2671] And what a great reminder, and it would be a point of application for you this morning.
[time=2678] A talk's just a talk.
[time=2680] This is a wasted 35 minutes if you don't have something to do with this.
[time=2685] We're to be doers of the word, not just hearers.
[time=2688] So here's your, here's your something to do.
[time=2691] Who do you know in your life?
[time=2693] I'm asking you.
[time=2694] Who do you know in your life who's right now today outside?
[time=2698] I'll use this terminology, outside the flock of God, somebody outside the family of God.
[time=2704] Who do you know?
[time=2705] Someone who's far from God, separated from God.
[time=2709] And they are absolutely buried.
[time=2711] And band, I'll have you come up at this time and we're going to just respond to all this in worship.
[time=2716] Who do you know who is absolutely buried in their sin?
[time=2720] Who do you know who is right now today?
[time=2723] They are, and you know it.
[time=2724] You can see it.
[time=2725] Right in the midst of being, it's getting stolen, it's getting killed, and it's getting destroyed.
[time=2733] Who do you know?
[time=2735] Maybe you live nearby, maybe they're in your family, maybe they're at work.
[time=2739] But see God's word is saying to those of us in the fold today, there are other sheep,
[time=2745] and they desperately need my sacrificial personal and intimate care.
[time=2751] And what a privilege we have to be a part of that process of seeing sheep come in.
[time=2756] I love how it says at the end, "They will hear my voice." Make no mistake, they're going to hear his, not yours.
[time=2763] But maybe you could pray for them, maybe you could have lunch with them, maybe you could invite them on a Sunday morning, maybe you could take them to your smaller setting, because
[time=2773] all of you are two-hour people, right, working on it.
[time=2777] Maybe you could bring them to your A.B.F. on a Sunday morning, maybe you could bring them to your small group on Tuesday night, maybe you could do something to extend a hand of
[time=2788] grace, to extend a hand of compassion and understanding as one who understands and knows
[time=2795] what it's like to have been saved and freed and cared for by the good shepherd.
[time=2802] Oh, how I hope this morning, as we respond and worship, we're going to sing two songs, and as we do so, I pray that you will lift your voice in gratitude.
[time=2812] As we do so, I pray that if you would, if you would, anybody here, if you would be encouraged
[time=2818] by just someone to pray with you about your need to know the shepherd.
[time=2825] We'll have elders, we'll have staff people, we'll have just people sensitive to what's going on down here in front, we'd love nothing more than to pray with you, talk with you.
[time=2832] But let's stand, stand church and let's respond this morning with great gratitude and with great praise.
[time=2838] Let's worship Him together.
[time=2867] We'll feed, may, fear.
[time=2874] And there I find you in the mystery and oceans deep, my faith will stand.
[time=2886] And I will call upon your name and keep my eyes above the waves when oceans rise.
[time=2903] My soul will rest in your embrace, for I am yours, and you are mine.
[time=2920] I will call upon your name and keep my eyes above the waves, for I am yours, for I am
[time=2942] yours, for I am yours, for I am yours, for I am yours, for I am yours, for I am yours
[time=2962] and you are mine, for I am yours, for I am yours, for I am yours, and you are mine.
[time=2988] I will call upon your name and keep my eyes above the waves, for I am yours, for I am yours.
[time=3017] Spirit, leave me with my trust, it's with our voice, for I am yours, for I am yours,
[time=3036] for I am yours, for I am yours, for I am yours, for I am yours, for I am yours, for I am yours
[time=3124] and I will call upon you, for I am yours, for I am yours, for I am yours, for I am yours
[time=3142] and you are mine, for I am yours, for I am yours, for I am yours, for I am yours, for I am yours
