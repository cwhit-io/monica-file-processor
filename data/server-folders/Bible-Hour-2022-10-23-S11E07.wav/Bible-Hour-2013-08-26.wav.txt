[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] Good morning everybody, my name is Steve Webster, I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Rock Ministries. I'm so thankful to be a part of a team that's working together to serve you, to serve our body as faithfully as we can.
[time=44] I wanted to tell you real quick this morning about three things that are available to you and that are coming up and the coming days here at the church.
[time=51] First, we have a resource available to you every week called Dicking Deeper that's available, first of all in the bulletin on Sunday morning, so as Kelly often says, if you're watching on the broadcast, we're so thankful that you are.
[time=61] But would you come and be a part of what we're doing in the room, we'd love to see you, love to thank you for watching.
[time=66] And as I said, the Dicking Deeper resource is available in the bulletin. It's a companion to our sermon series, each Sunday morning, that we have information about the sermon itself, application if you want to take it with you as a Bible study, and things for your family.
[time=80] And around the table section. So we're excited about that. We've been doing it for some time now and wanted to make sure that you were aware of it and that it was available to you.
[time=90] Secondly, there's our second apologetics seminar coming up on September 29th, it's Sunday evening at 6 o'clock on our North Campus at 6 o'clock in the evening.
[time=100] Apologetics loosely defined is a reasonable defense of the Christian faith, an intelligent defense. To respond to the questions, it's a way in to how do I respond to my co-workers who are hostile about the things of God, and you weren't really responding what they should.
[time=116] So come and ask your questions or sign up on the website for our second apologetics seminar, we'll see where it goes, we had a great response last time that September 29th at 6 o'clock across the street in the asylum.
[time=129] And third, our fall session of growth groups starts on October 24th, that's a Thursday night. All the course offerings are being finalized right now, but we're very much committed in this place to offering you ways to fellowship, not only in the room on Sunday morning, but also in smaller settings where you can be encouraged, where you can be challenged in your family, in your work life.
[time=150] There's something available for your kids, there's two sessions available for your kids coming up in October. So thank you very much for watching and for being a part of what we do here at Black Rock Ministries. We're so grateful that you are a part and that you're watching.
[time=164] And again, who's going to be a part of what we're doing here?
[time=169] [MUSIC]
[time=185] So change me broken.
[time=194] Life's been opened.
[time=205] Christ is revealed.
[time=213] Change me broken.
[time=219] Life's been opened.
[time=229] Christ is revealed.
[time=232] Change me broken.
[time=253] Christ is revealed.
[time=273] [MUSIC]
[time=292] [APPLAUSE]
[time=296] [MUSIC]
[time=316] So Christ is my reward.
[time=329] Now there's nothing in this world that can ever satisfy.
[time=342] Through every tribe, my soul will see no turning back.
[time=352] And I've been set free.
[time=357] Christ is enough for me.
[time=372] Everything I need is in you.
[time=378] Everything I need.
[time=383] Christ is my only hope.
[time=388] Enjoying my salvation.
[time=395] In this world will never fail.
[time=400] Heaven is our hope.
[time=405] Through every storm, my soul will see Jesus is here.
[time=415] To God be the glory.
[time=420] Christ is enough for me.
[time=435] Everything I need is in you.
[time=441] Everything I need.
[time=449] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=457] No turning back.
[time=463] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=469] No turning back.
[time=475] Sing the cross before me.
[time=479] The world behind me.
[time=482] No turning back.
[time=488] The cross before me.
[time=491] The world behind me.
[time=495] No turning back.
[time=500] Jesus is enough for me.
[time=508] Christ is enough for me.
[time=516] Everything I need is in you.
[time=527] Christ is enough for me.
[time=541] Everything I need is in you.
[time=547] Everything I need, I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=557] No turning back.
[time=563] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=569] No turning back.
[time=576] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=582] No turning back.
[time=588] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=594] No turning back.
[time=604] [APPLAUSE]
[time=610] We come this morning, as Kelly said, to the end of our five-week journey, Jesus according to Jesus.
[time=618] The apologetics number that we did last time, we focused on this.
[time=621] What's the Bible believe about itself?
[time=623] That seems important.
[time=624] Does the Bible think it's a collection of good advice and some helpful suggestions or does it believe something else?
[time=631] And my submission to you friends is it does.
[time=634] The Bible believes itself everywhere you turn to be God's very word, and that matters.
[time=639] So likewise, in that spirit, we said, "What does Jesus have to say about himself?" Well, quite a bit.
[time=646] It wasn't an exhaustive study, but we took five weeks journeying through what does Jesus say about himself?
[time=653] Jesus according to Jesus.
[time=657] We began with him saying, "I am the vine." It's a picture of fruitfulness.
[time=662] It's a vision of that, of what is in store for those who are connected to him, of full, rich, free, satisfying life.
[time=672] Sometimes with vines, with things that grow,
[time=678] they have to be pruned, that they'll bear more fruit, and same thing is true with life in Christ.
[time=683] He never promised us the yellow brick road out ahead.
[time=687] And if you've been sold that somewhere in your life before, that faith in life in Christ is a rose garden, and the way out before you will open up, and there will be no problems, that's not what Jesus says.
[time=699] And I want to be honest with you this morning about that very thing.
[time=702] We can have hope.
[time=704] Each one of these statements about himself is a declaration, a declaration and a promise to you.
[time=712] And on your behalf, the God will always, I hope you're hearing me.
[time=717] I'm so glad you're here, kids.
[time=719] Kids, God will always act in a way that's consistent with who he is.
[time=725] God will always be God.
[time=727] So you can trust that this morning.
[time=729] When he says, "I am the vine," you know that what he says will bear fruit in your life.
[time=734] You can listen.
[time=735] You can count on him.
[time=737] Fruit-bearing yields God's glory, and it results you guys in our complete and our full joy.
[time=743] Then we went to him being the way, the truth, and the life from John chapter 14 that implies lots of things.
[time=749] It implies that people are lost.
[time=754] Just real quick as we start.
[time=757] When Kelly talked about being lost in Germany, that day you remember that, you being lost in Germany, it's not loving to tell people that they're not lost if they actually are.
[time=770] It's not gracious.
[time=772] It's not good for people to let them think that everything is okay when it really isn't okay.
[time=777] That's not loving.
[time=778] And if you're a parent, if you're a parent and you're acting with your kids, like everything is okay, when it really isn't, then you're not loving them, respectfully, like you should.
[time=788] Same thing is true with Jesus.
[time=790] I'm the way.
[time=791] It's exclusive.
[time=793] And people have a hard time hearing that, and that's okay.
[time=796] It's a stumbling block for people.
[time=798] It always has.
[time=799] It was for them.
[time=800] It will be for many in our culture today.
[time=802] You mean he's the only way to be saved?
[time=805] Acts 4, 12 says that there is salvation found in no one else.
[time=810] That's a loving thing to say.
[time=812] There's not two or three or many ways to be saved, friends.
[time=815] It's not loving to act like there is when Jesus has given us good reason to believe that he is the only way.
[time=822] For example, there was a quote not many weeks ago from Annie Stanley from the Leadership Summit that said, "If a man can predict his death and resurrection and then actually carry it off, I'm with him, no matter what." So you can trust him.
[time=836] In fact, he gave his resurrection out in John chapter 2 in the temple as the sign that what he says is to be believed.
[time=844] So there's all kinds of implications for these things.
[time=849] We're begging you.
[time=852] If you're listening online, if you're listening on the TV broadcast, if you're here in the room this morning, we're begging you to know Jesus is to know life and to be unplugged from Jesus' friends is to be cut off from life.
[time=865] That's his conviction about himself.
[time=867] And we love you.
[time=869] We're glad that you're here.
[time=870] Whoever's within the sound of my voice, if you can hear me say that, I know that the world is a dark place.
[time=879] Crowded with guilt and shame and struggle if you're in college, if you're in high school, if you're in first grade, if you're in your 70s, the world crowds out the devil's a liar.
[time=891] And I encourage you this morning that Jesus is the life.
[time=894] In him is life.
[time=896] Much more to come on that.
[time=898] On the 18th of August we talked about him being the resurrection and the life and one of the most bizarrely well-known verses in the whole Bible is John 1135.
[time=907] Jesus wept.
[time=909] There's a lot in that verse.
[time=911] What kind of learn from Jesus wept a lot?
[time=914] The context is Lazarus, the brother of Mary and Martha is dead.
[time=919] And they missed him.
[time=921] You aren't supposed to bury people at his age.
[time=927] I sat with a student of mine, a former student of mine on Friday.
[time=931] She told me that she was going to have to bury her 25-year-old sister before Christmas time with terminal cancer.
[time=938] That's supposed to be okay.
[time=941] And I cried with her.
[time=944] I said, Jesus is the resurrection and the life.
[time=948] And because your sister has faith, because she's plugged into life,
[time=955] it can be faced.
[time=957] It's not good that her sister's going to die, but God is good.
[time=960] Amen?
[time=961] It's not good that you struggle and that you have no health insurance and that you struggle with joblessness and despair and guilt and shame.
[time=969] It's not good.
[time=970] It's hard.
[time=971] Those things are not good into themselves, but God is good.
[time=974] He's the resurrection and the life.
[time=976] And his statement that Jesus wept, friends, is a promise that he's close to you.
[time=981] He's not distant and far off and removed and cut off from your pain.
[time=986] Jesus wept as a statement.
[time=987] It's a promise that he's close by in your pain when you're lonely, when you're afraid, or when you feel ashamed.
[time=993] No guilt in life, no fear in death.
[time=996] This is the power of Christ in me.
[time=1001] We're going to sing that.
[time=1003] Sing it with gusto.
[time=1005] Jesus wept.
[time=1006] He's not a God far off, distant, asleep at the wheel, the world spinning off its axis.
[time=1011] And where are you, God?
[time=1012] He's right there, crying alongside you.
[time=1015] That's what we should do too.
[time=1018] There's all these miracles in the Gospel of John.
[time=1021] They're called signs in John.
[time=1023] They're demonstrations of who Jesus says.
[time=1025] This is the ultimate one.
[time=1027] I am the resurrection and the life.
[time=1029] He says to the sisters, do you believe this?
[time=1032] Do you believe this?
[time=1033] That makes all the difference in the world.
[time=1035] Knowing he said it is one thing, believing that it's true, is something else entirely.
[time=1040] And that's what, that's the call, friends.
[time=1043] We invite you into that this morning.
[time=1045] We invite you to believe.
[time=1046] I could not agree with Kelly Moore about the waters of baptism.
[time=1050] If you were there, nothing like it.
[time=1054] There is nothing like watching 20 people say, this is who I am now.
[time=1059] I decided to follow Jesus.
[time=1061] There's nothing greater in the world.
[time=1062] You could not give me anything to compare with that Jesus.
[time=1064] Anything to compare with that joy.
[time=1066] Nothing.
[time=1067] No amount of money, no position, no status, no title, no power could compare with that joy.
[time=1072] Of watching those that have come to know Christ declared their public allegiance to him.
[time=1077] It doesn't get any better than that.
[time=1079] And if you would give us that great joy in the future of watching you follow him publicly, then please don't steal our joy in that way.
[time=1087] God is not distant and far removed from your pain this morning.
[time=1091] It's closer than a brother, no matter where you are in your life.
[time=1096] I'm the good shepherd was last week with Kelly.
[time=1100] And it's contrasted with what the devil does.
[time=1102] The devil is a thief and a liar.
[time=1104] He's come to steal, to kill, and destroy.
[time=1107] And I'll say this to you.
[time=1110] The most effective lies are the ones that sound the most true.
[time=1114] No one loves you.
[time=1117] You're never going to get it right.
[time=1119] He'll never change.
[time=1122] Those are lies.
[time=1124] And I know they're lies because they're effective.
[time=1127] The devil is a good liar.
[time=1128] He's the father of lies.
[time=1130] So he's crafted this very, very well.
[time=1133] Jesus has come to give life and give it abundantly.
[time=1138] That verse says, "The thief only comes to steal, to kill, and to destroy.
[time=1143] But I have come," he said, "to give you life rich and satisfying, full and free." That's his promise.
[time=1150] That's his promise.
[time=1151] And aren't you glad?
[time=1153] Are you there, you guys?
[time=1154] Aren't you glad?
[time=1157] This verse from 1 John struck me huge last week.
[time=1161] The reason this is 1 John 3 verse 8, if you want to jot it down, 1 John 3 verse 8.
[time=1166] The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.
[time=1173] It has already happened, friends.
[time=1176] Victory has been won, death has been swallowed up in victory.
[time=1180] Death, where is your victory?
[time=1182] Where is your sting, Corinthian says, out of the Old Testament.
[time=1185] It's wonderful news.
[time=1187] That's why the gospel's good news.
[time=1189] He's already done what you can't do.
[time=1192] He's doing it every day, and you can trust him.
[time=1195] The good shepherd has laid down his life for his sheep.
[time=1199] He has overcome all the schemes, works, and lies of the enemy.
[time=1205] Let's say it again, I'd like you to respond in whatever way is appropriate.
[time=1209] Jesus has overcome all the schemes, all the works, all the lies of the enemy.
[time=1217] Praise be to God.
[time=1221] He's already done it.
[time=1224] The devil is a liar.
[time=1225] He is a liar, and he will lie to you in different ways.
[time=1228] If you're a child, if you're in your 70s, he'll lie to you, but he's a good liar.
[time=1234] But he's overcome the world.
[time=1237] Jesus has all his schemes, all his lies.
[time=1240] Trust him.
[time=1242] Become this morning to the truth that Jesus is the light of the world.
[time=1250] I found this quote during the week, and I thought it wildly appropriate in the light of all we've just heard about Jesus according to Jesus.
[time=1259] It's about the titles of God.
[time=1261] It's in your digging deeper document if you want to follow along there, or come back to it during the week if you want.
[time=1266] It's about the titles of God.
[time=1267] I mentioned it already earlier a little bit.
[time=1271] The titles of God are virtually promises.
[time=1275] It's from David Clarkson, when he's called a son, a shield, a strong tower, a hiding place, a portion.
[time=1284] The titles of Christ, light of the world, bread of life, the way, the truth, and life.
[time=1293] The titles of the Holy Spirit, the spirit of truth, holiness, glory, grace.
[time=1299] Faith may conclude as much out of these as out of promises.
[time=1303] Watch.
[time=1304] Is the Lord a son, S-U-N, and he will influence me.
[time=1309] Give me light. Is Christ life, and he will enliven me?
[time=1316] Is there is no better image than a lighthouse for this?
[time=1319] So you ask yourself, what does it mean that Christ is the light of the world?
[time=1323] That's a good question.
[time=1324] It means this, all things that a lighthouse provides.
[time=1327] Where are some things you guys that lighthouses provide?
[time=1330] Go ahead and call them out, and I'll repeat them over the microphone.
[time=1333] What's that?
[time=1334] Direction.
[time=1339] Warning.
[time=1340] Light, of course.
[time=1342] Yes, thank you.
[time=1344] Thank you.
[time=1345] What else?
[time=1346] Hope.
[time=1347] Safety.
[time=1348] How about that?
[time=1349] That's what it means to be a lighthouse.
[time=1351] He's light of the world.
[time=1352] He brings hope.
[time=1353] Safety.
[time=1354] Direction.
[time=1355] Warning.
[time=1356] When appropriate.
[time=1357] You get too close to the rocks.
[time=1359] You know where the rocks are.
[time=1362] He is the light of the world.
[time=1365] And we're going to focus our time today in John 8, verse 12.
[time=1368] And talk about three different things.
[time=1370] The first one is who he is.
[time=1373] That's a good place to start.
[time=1375] John 8, verse 12 will be our text this morning.
[time=1377] Go a little bit into John chapter 9, but I cannot wait to share this with you guys.
[time=1384] John 8, verse 12.
[time=1386] Again, Jesus spoke to them saying, I am the light of the world.
[time=1391] Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.
[time=1399] In the very next chapter in John 9, starting in verse 1, there's this remarkable interaction.
[time=1405] It just so happens.
[time=1406] There's a remarkable reaction with a blind man in Jesus and watch what happens.
[time=1411] John 9, verses 1 through 7.
[time=1414] As he, that is Jesus, passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
[time=1419] This wasn't a recent development.
[time=1421] It wasn't an over the weekend.
[time=1422] Oh, my word.
[time=1423] I can't see anymore.
[time=1424] The longer his affliction has gone on, the longer his hopelessness would be the case.
[time=1430] Things will never get better.
[time=1435] Blind from birth.
[time=1436] His disciples asked him, Rabbi, who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind?
[time=1442] Jesus answered.
[time=1443] It was not that this man sinned or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed
[time=1449] in him.
[time=1450] We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day.
[time=1455] Night is coming while no one can work.
[time=1457] As long as I'm in the world, I am the light of the world.
[time=1462] Having said these things, he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva.
[time=1467] He anointed the man's eyes with the mud and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of psilome,"
[time=1474] which means sent.
[time=1475] So he went and washed and came back seeing.
[time=1483] I am the light of the world.
[time=1484] Isn't just, take my word for it.
[time=1486] It isn't just, well, you said it, and that's pretty much it.
[time=1490] This, with this man who can't see, he has to act the miracle out by touching his eyes.
[time=1496] Because he can't see what he's doing, obviously.
[time=1499] I am the light of the world is more than just a statement, guys, it's a promise.
[time=1506] I once was blind, the song says, but now I see.
[time=1511] I was lost, but now I'm found to promise.
[time=1515] This is who Jesus is.
[time=1516] It's a great place to start.
[time=1518] There's way, way more though.
[time=1520] Looking back at our series, this struck me again.
[time=1524] She says of himself, "I am the way the truth and the life.
[time=1530] I am the resurrection and the life." If anyone follows me, he will have the light of life.
[time=1538] Write it down.
[time=1539] To know Jesus is to know life.
[time=1544] To be truly alive.
[time=1547] This lie, to what it is, the lie.
[time=1552] The life in Christ is about saying no to everything.
[time=1554] It's about all the things that you can't do.
[time=1556] Those Christians, they can't have any fun.
[time=1559] Nothing can be further from the truth.
[time=1561] It's a lie.
[time=1563] To know Christ, the Scripture says, is to be fully alive.
[time=1568] Isn't that wonderful?
[time=1570] That's wonderful.
[time=1572] To know Jesus is to know life.
[time=1575] Psalm 36 verse 9.
[time=1576] It took a little journey back into the Old Testament to bring in stuff about light.
[time=1580] When he says to these people, "I am the light of the world." What would they have heard him say?
[time=1585] And all this stuff came to mind.
[time=1588] Psalm 36 verse 9 says this, "For with you is the fountain of life.
[time=1593] In your light, do we see light?" And then a verse that's familiar to many of you.
[time=1599] Psalm 27 verse 1.
[time=1601] The Lord is my light and salvation.
[time=1607] Whom shall I fear?
[time=1609] The Lord is the stronghold of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?
[time=1614] I submit to you, friends, that when he says to these people, "I am the light of the world," that all these things, all these images cross their mind.
[time=1624] Isaiah 9 is a familiar passage to many of you.
[time=1626] I want to read it with you again.
[time=1628] It's familiar on Christmas time.
[time=1630] But here's the rest of the passage.
[time=1632] Isaiah 9 verse 1.
[time=1633] But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish.
[time=1638] In the former time, he brought in to contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naftali.
[time=1644] The 12 tribes of Israel got places to go when they came to the promised land.
[time=1649] And Naftali and Zebulun got some not very, didn't get a very good draw, if you will, from the Lord.
[time=1656] And so they were not highly regarded places.
[time=1658] In fact, when he says, when one of the disciples is called to follow Jesus, he goes, "These guys from Nazareth," which is in Galilee.
[time=1665] And he goes, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" It wasn't regarded very highly.
[time=1670] So their legacy was contempt.
[time=1673] Keep reading.
[time=1674] But in the latter time, he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan Galilee of the nations.
[time=1684] Isaiah does this all the time.
[time=1686] It's remarkable.
[time=1687] 700 years before Christ was born, Isaiah is talking about the future as though it was the past.
[time=1695] That's how sure he is that these promises are going to be kept, but they're true.
[time=1702] The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light.
[time=1708] Those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness on them has light shown.
[time=1713] What's he talking about, verse 6, "For to us a child is born.
[time=1719] To us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." Isaiah sees all these things as having already happened, though they're 700 years into the future.
[time=1737] How marvelous, how wonderful.
[time=1740] And my song shall ever be.
[time=1742] Luke 1, Zacharias, John the Baptist's dad, is singing this song.
[time=1748] When God tells he and his wife, they're not going to have the son, he goes, "Yeah, right.
[time=1754] I'm old.
[time=1755] It's never going to happen." And so he just struck mute for his wife's entire pregnancy.
[time=1761] And the first thing he says is Luke chapter 1, this beautiful song.
[time=1765] The first thing he says isn't really God really.
[time=1768] That isn't the first thing he says.
[time=1770] This is what he says.
[time=1772] Verse 78 of Luke 1, he says, "Because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high." Zacharias is John the Baptist's father, and he says basically, you guys, that everything before Jesus was, as it were, the night time.
[time=1790] And everything after is the day.
[time=1792] All of history is seen, forgive me, in the light of Jesus.
[time=1797] Now, it just so happens that for many, many years, it was BC and AD.
[time=1802] We tell time this way.
[time=1805] That's changing.
[time=1806] You may not know that, but it's changing.
[time=1808] I won't tell you how, but it's changing.
[time=1811] But for a long time, in academic circles, it was BC before Christ, in AD, and in Domini, in the year of our Lord.
[time=1818] All of history was framed around Jesus.
[time=1821] Verse 79, "To give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace." This is who Jesus is.
[time=1830] He's the sunrise.
[time=1831] He's the light.
[time=1832] This is the Bible's conviction about Jesus, but wait, there's more.
[time=1837] John chapter 1, this is right out of the gate.
[time=1840] The first thing John, the Apostle, says about Jesus.
[time=1843] John chapter 1, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word." This is Jesus, was with God, and the Word was God.
[time=1851] He was in the beginning with God.
[time=1853] All things were made through Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made.
[time=1858] In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
[time=1864] The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
[time=1869] I'll repeat verse 5, and you can respond again in whatever way seems appropriate to you.
[time=1874] The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
[time=1882] There was a man sent from God whose name was John.
[time=1884] He came as a witness.
[time=1885] The guy Zechariah was talking about, to bear witness about the light that all might believe through Him.
[time=1892] He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.
[time=1895] The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.
[time=1900] This is his conviction about Jesus.
[time=1902] This is who Jesus is, according to the Apostle John.
[time=1906] Psalm 4, and the light, Psalm 4 says this.
[time=1911] Here are many who say, verse 6, "Who will show us some good, lift up the light of your face on us, O Lord."
[time=1919] Psalm 44, verse 3 says, "But your right hand and your arm, and the light of your face, for you delighted in them."
[time=1926] The light of his face is common in the Psalms.
[time=1930] Lastly, it's in Psalm 89, in the new living translation.
[time=1934] Here's what it says.
[time=1935] Happy are those who hear the joyful call to worship, for they will walk in the light of your presence.
[time=1942] The ESV says face, Lord.
[time=1944] They rejoice all day long in your wonderful reputation.
[time=1949] They exalt in your righteousness.
[time=1953] Okay, Steve, where are you going with this?
[time=1955] I'm glad you asked.
[time=1956] Matthew 17 is where I'm going.
[time=1958] And the transfiguration of Jesus.
[time=1960] Kids, you're in the room.
[time=1962] So kids transfigured, something like transformed.
[time=1966] Think transformers.
[time=1968] He was changed before them.
[time=1970] Actually, the word that was used in the original language is metamorphosis.
[time=1974] He was changed before them.
[time=1976] Up in the mountain, at night, these things happen.
[time=1980] Verse 2, Matthew 17 says this.
[time=1982] And he was transfigured, transformed before them.
[time=1986] And his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
[time=1996] Other gospels say that they became white, whiter than any wanderer on earth can make them.
[time=2004] And then I went through Revelation chapter 1.
[time=2006] In verse 16, I thought about this.
[time=2009] Speaking also of Jesus, in his right hand, he held seven stars.
[time=2015] From his mouth came a sharp two edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in all its strength.
[time=2025] This is who Jesus is, really, who he actually is.
[time=2033] And then I thought about Revelation 21, the very end of God's word.
[time=2038] Revelation 21, starting in verse 22.
[time=2041] I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.
[time=2047] And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light.
[time=2052] Its lamp is the lamb.
[time=2054] By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.
[time=2059] The lamp is the lamb.
[time=2061] He's the light of the city.
[time=2065] It just so happens that when he was telling the story in John 8 about being the light of the world, it was the face of tabernacles.
[time=2072] And during that feast, they had these gigantic bowls filled with the garments of the priest lit on fire with oil,
[time=2079] and it was said in the Jewish literature that the entire city of Jerusalem was lit up, which never happened at night time, because they didn't have street lights.
[time=2088] But during this time it was, and it just so happens that when he says, "I'm the light of the world," that was likely going on.
[time=2094] They had an image, this beautiful limestone, and the light reflecting off of it.
[time=2097] Can you imagine how it looked across the valley, the city on fire, glowing?
[time=2104] And he says, "I'm the light of the whole world."
[time=2110] Wow.
[time=2111] C.S. Lewis says, "This is a very famous quote from him, and it's appropriate to our time together.
[time=2117] I believe in Christianity as I believe the sun has risen.
[time=2123] Not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else."
[time=2130] That's exactly what we're talking about.
[time=2132] That's who Jesus is. That's why who he is matters.
[time=2136] And that's the first point in your outline, is who he is.
[time=2140] And I think we've painted a picture this morning from his word that's fairly compelling.
[time=2145] Moving on from that, friends, number two, who you are.
[time=2149] It's not just who Jesus is, it's who you are in the light, forgive me, of who he is.
[time=2155] Who you are.
[time=2157] You won't have to walk in darkness.
[time=2160] John chapter 1 says this, "After it describes him in those amazing terms that all things were made through him,
[time=2166] and he's the word, and he was there in the beginning, and all those things.
[time=2170] He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.
[time=2174] John chapter 1 verse 10, verse 11.
[time=2176] He came to his own, his own people did not receive him, but to all who did receive him,
[time=2182] who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.
[time=2187] Who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
[time=2194] That's who you are having decided to follow Jesus.
[time=2198] You're his son. You're his daughter.
[time=2201] You've been adopted into his family, and you have all the rights and privileges available to those who are in the family of God.
[time=2209] Now, there'd be these that you don't feel that way, and I get that.
[time=2212] I've been there before.
[time=2213] We've talked about it from this pulpit before.
[time=2215] It's true.
[time=2216] I know that the way you feel sometimes betrays those things, but don't let your feelings drive the bus.
[time=2223] They're bad drivers.
[time=2225] Your feelings are not good indicators of reality.
[time=2228] They will deceive you.
[time=2230] Again, nobody loves you.
[time=2232] I feel worthless.
[time=2233] I feel lost.
[time=2234] I feel hopeless.
[time=2235] I feel like it's never going to change.
[time=2239] I know you feel doesn't make it true, even though you feel that way.
[time=2247] Isaiah 60 says this.
[time=2250] "Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.
[time=2256] For behold, darkness shall cover the earth and thick darkness to the peoples, but the Lord will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you.
[time=2265] And nations shall come to your light in kings to the brightness of your rising." This is who he says God's people are.
[time=2273] They shine like this beautiful light that will draw people in.
[time=2277] That's who you are.
[time=2279] And lastly, we'll end here with what you have, who he is, who you are.
[time=2284] And lastly, what we have, what you have as a child of God.
[time=2290] Paul says, this is how he opens his letter to 2 Timothy, 2 Timothy.
[time=2296] Watch.
[time=2298] Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, according to the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus.
[time=2304] There we are again.
[time=2306] Life.
[time=2307] John 812 says, "If you follow him, you have the light of life." And that will sustain you, friends, through dark times, through the valley.
[time=2319] Colossians 3.4 says, "When Christ, who is your life, appears, you will also appear with him in glory."
[time=2327] Christ, who is your life?
[time=2330] Psalm 56 says this, "I must perform my vows to you, O God.
[time=2335] I will render thank offerings to you, for you have delivered my soul from death." I hope that that's true of you this morning that you will sing with all your heart.
[time=2343] We're going to sing again about Christ being the Lord of Lords.
[time=2348] I hope that you'll sing with all your heart, for you have delivered my soul from death, my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.
[time=2357] Come after this verse up to you as a prayer.
[time=2360] That's what the Psalms are, the prayers, the songs.
[time=2364] It's in your bulletin. It's Psalm 43 here under the last point.
[time=2368] I want to encourage you to pray this prayer this week because you're going to need it, somehow.
[time=2372] I promise, wherever you are, wherever you're doing, you're going to need this prayer.
[time=2376] Psalm 4 to 3 verse 3, "Send out your light and your truth.
[time=2381] Let them lead me." That will never lead you astray.
[time=2385] Never.
[time=2386] Let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling, God, to the place where you are.
[time=2390] Then it will go to the altar of God to God, my exceeding joy.
[time=2395] I will praise you with the liar, oh God, my God, with a little harp.
[time=2400] If you have a little harp, play it.
[time=2402] Play your heart out.
[time=2403] If you have a liar, do it.
[time=2405] If you don't, Matthew 5, next verse is for you.
[time=2409] Okay?
[time=2411] This is striking.
[time=2413] Jesus says, "I am the light of the world," and then we end with, again, what we have, the light of life.
[time=2419] And what he says about, if you follow Jesus, says, "You are the light of the world." Matthew 5 verse 14, "You are the light of the world."
[time=2430] A city set in a hill cannot be hidden, nor do people light a lamp, put it under a basket,
[time=2436] but on a stand.
[time=2437] Kids, hide it under a bushel.
[time=2439] No, I'm going to let it shine.
[time=2442] You know that, I hope you know that song.
[time=2447] Guys, got it.
[time=2450] Okay.
[time=2451] That's okay.
[time=2452] Under a basket, on a stand, it gives light to all in the house in the same way let your light shine before others,
[time=2459] that they may see your good works and give glory to your father who is in heaven.
[time=2465] That's the takeaway.
[time=2466] You want something to do?
[time=2467] There it is.
[time=2468] Let your light shine before men.
[time=2471] How, Steve?
[time=2473] How do I do that?
[time=2475] It's a good question.
[time=2477] It's what you say.
[time=2483] It's what you don't do.
[time=2485] There are sins that we commit sometimes are called sins of commission, things that you do that you shouldn't do.
[time=2489] There are also sins of omission, ways that we sin by not doing something.
[time=2495] So friends, I want to encourage you this week, the grace that we sang about this earlier to let that wash over you.
[time=2502] And if you're struggling, price on 43.
[time=2504] God, send out your light and your truth.
[time=2506] Let him lead me.
[time=2507] How can I be a witness?
[time=2508] How can I be a light?
[time=2510] He will not refuse to answer that prayer.
[time=2513] I promise you.
[time=2514] He will tell you how.
[time=2516] And whilst we're in a still small voice, you'll send someone your way.
[time=2520] You'll be amazed how God's word speaks to you directly.
[time=2523] It's like you're speaking directly to me.
[time=2525] People say it all the time.
[time=2526] Well, it is.
[time=2531] What's the end with Psalm 23?
[time=2533] And there's a couple more things to say.
[time=2535] You all know these verses, Psalm 23.
[time=2538] And I got to pray these with my student on Friday.
[time=2544] The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=2547] I have everything I need.
[time=2549] I shall not want.
[time=2551] He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[time=2553] He leads me beside still waters.
[time=2555] He restores my soul.
[time=2557] He leads me in paths of righteousness for his namesake.
[time=2561] Even though I walk to the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
[time=2567] For you're with me.
[time=2568] You're Rod and your staff.
[time=2570] They comfort me.
[time=2572] He's the good shepherd.
[time=2576] It's a great song by Switchfoot called "The Shadow Proves the Sunshine." And when you're walking to the valley of the shadow of death, that proves that there's light.
[time=2586] Without light, there would be no shadow.
[time=2588] Remember that, friends.
[time=2590] When you're in the shadows, you're only there because there is a light shining greater than that shadow.
[time=2596] It draws it into contrast.
[time=2598] He has promised you.
[time=2600] God's titles are promises.
[time=2603] The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[time=2606] Whom shall I fear?
[time=2607] The Lord is the stronghold of my life.
[time=2610] Of whom shall I be afraid?
[time=2611] Say it to yourself every single day.
[time=2614] At work, in the cul-de-sac, wherever you find yourself.
[time=2618] That's the application.
[time=2620] As the band comes up, I read you a quote from D.L. Moody.
[time=2631] The valley of the shadow of death holds no darkness for the child of God.
[time=2636] There must be light else, there could be no shadow.
[time=2641] Jesus is the light.
[time=2644] He has overcome death.
[time=2648] You're about to sing these words.
[time=2650] Lord, I need you.
[time=2653] Every hour I need you.
[time=2656] My one defense, my righteousness, Lord, how I need you.
[time=2661] I don't know how you need him.
[time=2663] I know that you need him today.
[time=2666] So whatever you need him to be, I pray that you would sing this song with all your heart.
[time=2671] Let me pray in light of what we've said.
[time=2673] And if you need to come down front, if there are any elders in the room that would come down front and be available to pray with you, if you are in the dark in any way in your life and you're craving the light, you're like a flower that needs the sun.
[time=2686] That hymn, joyful, joyful, weird joy, says hearts unfold like flowers before you.
[time=2692] I love that image.
[time=2693] Maybe you're feeling a little shriveled up today.
[time=2695] I don't know.
[time=2696] But we'll be down here in front of you.
[time=2698] If you want to pray with somebody, if you want some encouragement, some light, Jesus is the light.
[time=2704] We'd like to talk with you about that if you want.
[time=2706] They're going to play.
[time=2707] We're going to worship.
[time=2708] If you want to come down and pray with somebody, we'll be here.
[time=2710] Again, the elders in the room, come down front, make yourself available.
[time=2714] God, prepare our hearts even now if we need you.
[time=2720] Every hour, right now we need you.
[time=2725] God, the world is a dark, dark place.
[time=2730] But the light has shined.
[time=2731] In the darkness, the darkness has not overcome it.
[time=2736] Father, I pray for anyone within the sound of my voice and the room online over the broadcast
[time=2742] that they would respond rightly to the truth that your son Jesus is the light of the world.
[time=2749] And that they don't have to walk in darkness anymore.
[time=2752] They can have the light of life.
[time=2754] He promised that God.
[time=2756] It's true.
[time=2757] May it be so today.
[time=2758] May the light dawn in someone's heart this morning because they have placed their faith and their trust in the person of Jesus.
[time=2766] God, fill our hearts.
[time=2767] May we sing with great joy.
[time=2770] Like the Psalmist said, God, you are my exceeding joy.
[time=2773] As we sing, may it be so this morning.
[time=2775] Proud of these things in Jesus' name.
[time=2777] [AMEN] [MUSIC] The Lord I come. [MUSIC] The heart I can face. [MUSIC] The God we need. [MUSIC] And I find a voice. [MUSIC] And when I tell you. [MUSIC] And I follow it for.
