[time=0] [MUSIC - 230 seconds]
[time=260] [APPLAUSE]
[time=270] [MUSIC - 49 seconds]
[time=323] I see his love and mercy, washing over all our sins.
[time=333] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=373] I see a generation rising up to take their place with silver space, silver space.
[time=384] [MUSIC]
[time=386] I see an airy vibe of serene as we pray and sing.
[time=395] We're on our knees.
[time=402] Hosanna, Hosanna in the higher.
[time=424] [MUSIC - 100 seconds]
[time=554] Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=563] It's great to be able to spend these few minutes with you as always.
[time=566] And unlike most Sundays, this past Sunday, I had the privilege.
[time=571] And it always is a privilege to sit and listen.
[time=575] I'm so grateful for our elders and our leadership here at Blackhawk.
[time=579] We have decided in recent years to move toward more of a teaching team approach while I'm teaching on a somewhat regular basis.
[time=588] There are 15, 16, 17 weeks a year when other gifted talented communicators from our staff and team are teaching and preaching here at Blackhawk.
[time=599] And I love what it does for our family as they get to hear from a diverse perspective.
[time=605] I love what it does for our gifted teachers who get more and more experience.
[time=610] And quite honestly, I love what it does for me and my family.
[time=613] You have no idea what it's like after all these years to actually come to church with my family and sit and take it in and sing and take notes and be with my kids.
[time=623] I absolutely love it.
[time=625] And Jesse Hanna, our operations pastor here at Blackhawk and one of our teaching team members, brings a message today that you'll see having to do with something that's important.
[time=634] We have over these last couple of weeks embarked upon a new series.
[time=639] We call it Vision.
[time=642] And it really is a preferred picture, a compelling picture of a future.
[time=646] We are trying our very best with God's help to pursue.
[time=650] And in that picture, we see Blackhawk as a place deeply committed to gathering, connecting and going.
[time=657] And a couple of weeks ago, I got to teach on and lead a discussion regarding the priority of the gathering on Sunday morning.
[time=666] Jesse comes today talking about the priority of circles, not rose, circles, not rose.
[time=673] I'll let him explain it, but it is a life-changing and I believe strongly biblical truth that you all need to consider.
[time=681] You were not meant nor was I to live life alone.
[time=684] You were not meant, you weren't designed by God nor was I to live life and approach life in isolation.
[time=690] We were made by God to live in community.
[time=693] And so at Blackhawk, we want to offer that to you.
[time=696] We want to offer smaller settings where you can love and be loved, know others and be known back, serve and be served.
[time=705] There are settings on Sunday mornings.
[time=707] There are smaller settings throughout the week.
[time=710] We would love nothing more than to help you connect to a life-changing, eternity-altering, small setting where the Word of God and the Spirit of God and the people of God are at work.
[time=721] So watch this morning.
[time=723] Take in what Jesse has to share.
[time=725] It was a tremendous morning and I can't wait for you to hear it and I can't wait to be back next week with a message on the great call of God on his people to go.
[time=735] So tune in next week for that.
[time=737] Thank you so much for tuning in today and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=741] God bless you.
[time=742] We're in week two of our vision series, as you can see on the TVs and the screens.
[time=751] And I'm excited.
[time=752] I think it's a good time.
[time=753] It's a good way to kind of stop and kind of take a look from a higher vantage point of what this place is all about.
[time=761] And so just like a little story, a few years back, I was able to.
[time=766] I got to go with a friend to hike in the Grand Canyon to backpack, carry everything in your pack, tent and everything, food and all that kind of stuff.
[time=773] We hiked down into the Grand Canyon and all the way down to the Colorado River, stuck our feet in and then hiked out, camped along the way.
[time=780] Well, while we were headed down, while we were hiking down there, we got a little lost.
[time=787] I'll just be honest.
[time=788] We got a little lost.
[time=789] It's not hard to do in the Grand Canyon because everything just likes this desert of rocks and it's not the easiest trail to follow.
[time=798] Like if you go to the Smokies, they have like signs and little markers.
[time=802] No.
[time=803] Out west, they don't care if you die.
[time=804] They've got plenty of humans, right?
[time=806] They protect a rock and a plant and a tree and there's finds, but humans who cares.
[time=811] We got plenty of those.
[time=812] Right?
[time=813] They don't care.
[time=814] Out west, that's why it's called the Wild West.
[time=815] They don't care if you die.
[time=816] It's a plant they care about.
[time=817] Rocks, don't touch them.
[time=819] Humans?
[time=820] What about that?
[time=821] So we got lost and we were kind of hiking.
[time=825] It got into the nighttime and we were like, "Oh, we should probably never hike at night." Okay?
[time=830] That's just one of the rules.
[time=831] We did it anyway.
[time=832] It was silly.
[time=833] There was circumstances that led us to do such things.
[time=836] And so we just kept going.
[time=838] We'll find the trail.
[time=839] We'll find it.
[time=840] We'll just keep going.
[time=841] Big mistake.
[time=842] Everything we did was pretty much wrong.
[time=843] I'm a better hiker than this.
[time=844] So don't judge me by this one trip.
[time=846] Anyway, I'm alive so we made it out.
[time=849] And so we decided after a few hours of hiking in the dark down these ledges and things
[time=855] that we should probably just call the night, get in the tent and just see what we can see in the morning.
[time=860] And so we did that and the wind is just whipping all night long so we didn't really sleep really well.
[time=864] But when we got up in the morning and the light was, you know, we could see everything.
[time=867] We were up on this big ridge and we could see the trail.
[time=872] Literally, it looked like somebody just drew a pencil on the ground.
[time=875] We could see the trail.
[time=876] And we were like, oh, that's, we went to the lab.
[time=879] We should have kept going.
[time=880] And we figured out what we did wrong and got back on the trail and was good.
[time=883] But once we got high enough, once we had a higher vantage point, we could see exactly where we were supposed to go, exactly what we were supposed to be doing.
[time=892] And so that's kind of what this series is about.
[time=893] We're kind of going to jump up kind of high and kind of look down to this place called Blackhawk.
[time=898] And what we're trying to do, what's our mission, what's our vision, what are we trying to accomplish as a people together?
[time=903] Because sometimes we just forget what we're doing.
[time=906] Sometimes routines take over.
[time=909] How many of you have ever walked into a room where you go from the kitchen or wherever you go somewhere and you walk in there and you're like, oh, what's that coming in here to get?
[time=920] You know, you've been there.
[time=921] I know you've done it.
[time=922] Okay.
[time=923] It's fine.
[time=924] And so you just kind of forget what you were doing or how many of you, this is a scary one, but I'm sure we've all done this.
[time=929] But how you get in your car and you've got to go somewhere and you drive and you pull in and you kind of like, oh, I'm here, wait, I don't remember really driving here.
[time=941] You know what I mean?
[time=943] You're like, I don't remember getting on 69.
[time=945] What?
[time=946] Come on.
[time=947] I know you do.
[time=948] You're just kind of in this zone of driving and all of a sudden you're kind of, oh wait, you don't really remember the 15 minutes of driving you did.
[time=954] Come on.
[time=955] I know you've done it.
[time=956] Thank you.
[time=957] [AMEN] Thank you.
[time=959] All right, we lose sight.
[time=960] We just kind of get going into the routine of life.
[time=963] And so this series is kind of a time to just kind of look, what are we doing?
[time=966] What's our role?
[time=967] How are we doing this, all this kind of stuff?
[time=970] What's going on in Black Hawk?
[time=971] How do I play?
[time=972] How do I fit in?
[time=973] I think that's why this series is so important for all of us.
[time=978] It's kind of, this series is kind of a design to repaint the picture of our destination.
[time=982] It reminds us of why and what we're doing.
[time=985] Vision.
[time=986] Okay.
[time=987] If you want a definition of vision, I think Andy Stanley says this.
[time=989] Vision is a mental picture of what could be fueled by a passion that it should be.
[time=999] And so we hope to bring our focus and remind us of why we're here and what's our part in this whole thing.
[time=1005] And when I think about mission, you know, I think mission, vision, values, all those things that you're supposed to think about when you're in an organization, right?
[time=1013] That helps me to kind of, I think in boxes, I think in pictures, I think in questions.
[time=1018] And so this message is kind of framed up with some questions.
[time=1021] Okay.
[time=1022] That's how I've kind of laid it.
[time=1023] I think they're in your outline.
[time=1024] And the first question is this, what do we want people to become?
[time=1029] That's the first question.
[time=1030] This is how I think about it.
[time=1031] When we did, yeah, right there, look at that.
[time=1033] What do we want people to become?
[time=1034] That's pretty sweet.
[time=1035] I like that.
[time=1036] So when I was just doing mysteries, that's how we kind of thought everything.
[time=1040] We kind of stopped and say, okay, when these kids get to senior year, when they're going to head off to college or military or jobs, what do we want them to be?
[time=1048] What do we want them to become at that point?
[time=1050] So we could organize all of our programs, all of our relationships, and all the things we're doing to make that happen.
[time=1056] That's kind of what we wanted to do.
[time=1057] And there's no different here.
[time=1058] When we ask the question, what do we want people to become?
[time=1061] I think it's pretty simple.
[time=1063] Jesus told us this in Matthew 28.
[time=1066] This is kind of like the overall vision of church.
[time=1069] Okay.
[time=1070] If you call yourself a church and you hold up, you lift up the scriptures, you hold them in high regard.
[time=1074] If you're a church and you believe in the scriptures, this is the mission.
[time=1078] It says this.
[time=1079] Matthew 28, 18 to 20.
[time=1081] Verse 18 says this.
[time=1082] "And Jesus came and sent to them all the authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[time=1087] Go therefore and make disciples of all nations." That doesn't mean the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1092] Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you and behold, I'm with you always to the end of the age.
[time=1099] Jesus makes it pretty clear that our mission overall as a believer, as a church, is to make disciples.
[time=1106] So however our days interact, the flow of our days, when we're at work, when we're at school, when we're at play, however we're interacting with people, our goal, our mission is to make disciples, we should be relating with people in such a way that they would want to follow Christ, that they would hear of Jesus, that they would want to know more, that we're relating with people in such a way.
[time=1126] That is our mission, big picture of mission.
[time=1129] That's what it's about, make disciples.
[time=1132] Now how does that kind of play out, how does that kind of zero in here in this place, right?
[time=1138] How does that kind of fold down into or kind of come into in this place?
[time=1142] When we say, what do we want people to come at Black Hawk, we say Colossians 128, we've kind of grabbed that verse to kind of give us a vision of what we want people to become.
[time=1151] It says this, first, I'm sorry, Colossians 128, "Hembriff will claim warning everyone in teaching everyone with all wisdom that we may present everyone, mature/complete in
[time=1162] Christ." Completeness is our vision.
[time=1166] It reads it like this on a, it should read like this on our t-shirt, right?
[time=1169] If we were to hand out t-shirts about this place, Black Hawk on the back would say this, "By God's grace and for his glory we strive to present every person complete in Christ." That's our vision.
[time=1179] That's what we're trying to do here.
[time=1180] Jesus gave us to make disciples, Colossians 128 says, "Okay, here's how it kind of narrows in.
[time=1186] Here's what we want to be about.
[time=1187] We want to make complete disciples for Christ.
[time=1190] What do we want people to become complete in Christ?
[time=1192] We want to love people and walk alongside people.
[time=1195] We want to help one another.
[time=1197] We want to love one another in such a way that they become complete.
[time=1201] We want to see moms and dads and teenagers, college age, young marrieds, no marrieds,
[time=1207] right?
[time=1208] We want to see all people become complete in Christ.
[time=1212] Listen to this, we want our staff to be complete.
[time=1216] We want our pastors to be complete.
[time=1222] We want our small group leaders and our A/B/F leaders to be complete in Christ.
[time=1229] Completing people for Christ is like our vision and it's not so much.
[time=1233] I said that about the staff and the elders and the pastors and all that.
[time=1236] It's not so much that we're the spiritual great people because, oh, I'm in leadership at Black Hawk and we're going to complete you.
[time=1243] It's not about that.
[time=1244] It's not about me.
[time=1245] Oh, come here you feeble, we feeble believer.
[time=1248] You don't know what you're doing.
[time=1250] Let me complete you.
[time=1251] That's not what we're saying.
[time=1253] We're saying together we complete one another.
[time=1256] Together when we minister each other, when we challenge each other, when we go after Jesus together, we complete one another.
[time=1263] It helps us all do that.
[time=1266] Not me and complete you or KB completes us.
[time=1268] We're in this together.
[time=1271] And around here we say completeness looks like somebody who's growing in, practicing, following, doing everything they can to develop the five elements in their life.
[time=1280] I think we have a slide for that.
[time=1282] The five elements, prayerful abiding, right?
[time=1287] We want people who are, if you're growing in your prayer life, that's huge, right?
[time=1291] The complete disciples, somebody who's growing in that or we got the scriptures, we got the missional serving, we got transverse communities, making disciples.
[time=1298] Those are the things that our study from the elders are done.
[time=1300] Those make up a disciple and when we're growing in those, and challenging ourselves in those, and really, those are the things that help us get closer to Christ.
[time=1309] That's what completeness works, is somebody who's doing those.
[time=1314] So that's kind of, that's the vision, the mission kind of thing.
[time=1317] So that's the first question.
[time=1318] The second question is what do we want people to do?
[time=1323] Okay, if our vision is complete disciples who are growing and striving and working on
[time=1330] and who are made up of the five elements, what do we want people to do, right?
[time=1334] And I want to be very careful with this word do.
[time=1338] I think sometimes we get lost in, we find ourselves, surround, we have this idea that
[time=1344] if I just do more, if I just pray more, if I just go to church more, if I just read my Bible more, if I just help enough old ladies cross the street, I'm good.
[time=1353] It's not what Jesus died on the cross for.
[time=1357] If we are doing, if our doing is disconnected from our relationship with Jesus, if it's
[time=1364] disconnected from His finished work on the cross, it's dirty rags, we've missed it, right?
[time=1372] It's not about doing, yes, there's things we're doing, right?
[time=1376] But it's not about doing to gain favor, to gain God's more love.
[time=1379] That's not, He loves you, done, can't go anymore.
[time=1383] Our trust must solely be and completely surrounded and captured by Christ.
[time=1387] We are in Christ, our identity, our value, our worth is in Him, not in our doing.
[time=1393] We don't trust in these activities, we trust in Him.
[time=1397] Our relationship with God isn't about a checklist of doing, but resting in what Christ did on
[time=1403] the cross.
[time=1404] I just want to make sure we say that because when you put a slide that has elements, sometimes it can just look like a big old list of much more stuff to do, and that's not what Jesus died for.
[time=1415] Does that make sense?
[time=1417] Good.
[time=1418] Question two, what do we have people to do?
[time=1419] KB told us last week, as a place, as a church, as a family, we want to gather.
[time=1427] Welcome to it, you're here, good job.
[time=1430] We connect and we go.
[time=1432] What do we want people to do, we want to gather, we want to connect and we go.
[time=1437] Those are the three main things at this place.
[time=1440] Remember, high place, high, from a high vantage point, those are the big things.
[time=1444] What do we want people to do?
[time=1445] We want them to gather, to encounter God, we want to connect, to engage in growth, we want to extend, we want to go to extend His reach.
[time=1453] That's what this place is about.
[time=1454] What do we want people to become, complete files of Christ, practicing the five elements, what do we want people to do, what do we want us to do, gather, connect and go.
[time=1463] I love what KB said about the gathering, that this gathering isn't the final destination.
[time=1471] Being here isn't, you just go here and that's it.
[time=1474] This is kind of the beginning point.
[time=1476] This is the beginning of the conversation and then we hopefully move people into smaller settings, it kind of continues that conversation, right?
[time=1483] You get up, you get in the morning, you get to church, it's awesome.
[time=1486] We come here not just to sit, but we gather in this time to collectively proclaim with
[time=1492] our presence and our voices and our minds that God is the Creator of all.
[time=1497] He's the Lord of Lord, He is the God who hung the moon and scattered the stars, the only proper response or reaction to such a truth is the acknowledge Him in worship.
[time=1508] And I think Psalms 95 captures this the best, but the Lord is a great God and a great King
[time=1514] above all gods.
[time=1515] In His hand are the depths of the earth, the heights of the mountains are His also.
[time=1521] The sea is His, for He made it.
[time=1524] In His hands form the dry land, oh come let us worship and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker, for He is our God and we are the people of His pasture, the sheep
[time=1536] of His hand.
[time=1537] We come together to lift that God up, to celebrate that God, wherever you are in your journey
[time=1544] of faith.
[time=1545] Maybe you're here this morning, you're not sure about this God stuff.
[time=1548] We're so glad you're here.
[time=1550] Keep going.
[time=1551] Maybe you're here and you've kind of returned from church, you've kind of had the God stuff when you're a kid, maybe you know your life struggles and turned and everything you're here today and you're just, you're like I just, I don't have any answers and I'm looking for answers.
[time=1563] Maybe in the welcome Christ for a long time, wherever you are in that journey, just remember that the God we lift up is amazing and awesome and He loves you and He wants a relationship
[time=1575] with you.
[time=1576] That's why we're here to proclaim that, to proclaim the God.
[time=1579] The good news is that, hey, there is a God and He is amazing in Jesus through the blood of Christ, you can know Him.
[time=1586] That's why we're here to lift that up, to proclaim that over and over every Sunday.
[time=1590] We're going to proclaim that.
[time=1592] You're going to hear that.
[time=1593] That's why we gather, to celebrate and know that that God is great and He wants a relationship with us.
[time=1599] What do we want people to become, complete disciples of Christ who are working on growing in the five elements?
[time=1605] What do we want people to do?
[time=1606] We want people to gather.
[time=1607] We want people to connect, we want people to go.
[time=1611] If you will allow me just a little more time, I'd like to talk about the second one, the connect.
[time=1616] That's the rest of my message tonight, and I used to speak in a 212, today, this morning,
[time=1623] is connect.
[time=1625] We connect to engage in growth.
[time=1627] This is one of our elements.
[time=1629] Transformation community, lives are transformed and changed for everyone.
[time=1632] People are willing to live and share all of life together.
[time=1636] If you would turn in your Bible, if you have one, if you don't, that's okay, I'm going to read it.
[time=1641] Acts chapter 2, where we feel like this community, this relational connectedness kind of is grounded
[time=1648] in.
[time=1649] One of the passages we use as far as transformation community, we're going to begin in verse 42.
[time=1656] Acts chapter 2, verse 42, they devoted themselves, the apostles teaching and to the fellowship,
[time=1663] to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
[time=1665] Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles.
[time=1670] All the believers were together and they had everything in common.
[time=1673] They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.
[time=1678] Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts.
[time=1680] They broke bread in their homes and ate together a glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people.
[time=1688] And the Lord added to their number daily, those who were being saved.
[time=1692] One of our main objectives, one of our hopes, one of our wishes, one of our dreams, and one of the places we want to try to move people, one of the places we want to be uncompromising and passionate about is to move people, moms and dads and teenagers and little kids and big kids, all the spectrum, all people want to move them into smaller settings.
[time=1712] Whether that's a living room or a classroom or a Taco Bell, smaller settings, why?
[time=1720] Why do we want that?
[time=1723] We want to move people into smaller settings because circles are better than rows.
[time=1728] Say that with me.
[time=1729] Circles are better than rows, we need that again.
[time=1733] Circles are better than rows.
[time=1738] Let's do a little field trip back to Genesis 1, if you want to turn there, Genesis 1, 26-27.
[time=1743] I think we'll discover the first circle.
[time=1747] The first circle, circles are better than rows.
[time=1751] If you follow along, I'm going to start in 26 and I'll go to 27.
[time=1758] Says this, "Then God said, 'Let us make mankind in our image and our likeness so that
[time=1764] they may rule over the fish and the sea and the birds and the sky over the livestock and all the wild animals and over all the creatures that move along the ground.' So God created mankind in His own image.
[time=1776] In the image of God, He created a male and female.
[time=1779] He created them.
[time=1781] Let us.
[time=1782] Let us." There's something happening in that text that kind of indicates that God is more than just one.
[time=1789] He is three, but one.
[time=1790] He is holy trinity.
[time=1793] God is a relational being.
[time=1797] God is three persons, yet one, in perfect relationship with God, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1803] The unity of God, perfect intimacy and relational connectedness, hence it makes sense that us,
[time=1809] we would be created with this relational need, this ability and need and want and desire
[time=1816] to be in relationships.
[time=1818] Right?
[time=1819] How many of you have had teenagers or you have them right now or you've had them or they're coming?
[time=1823] Okay?
[time=1824] Wherever you're at in that spectrum, when they hit around 12, 13, friendships become like huge.
[time=1830] "Mom, I've got to go to the game.
[time=1833] All my friends are going to be there." Right?
[time=1836] There's something happens in the brain and they're wiring.
[time=1839] They're just living out how they're wired.
[time=1841] They long for.
[time=1843] We all long for this relational connectedness.
[time=1847] It is such a big deal.
[time=1848] We are relational because our God is relational.
[time=1853] We long for these real authentic relationships.
[time=1856] We have been created for that.
[time=1857] Listen to this.
[time=1858] He is deeply grounded in the nature of God.
[time=1861] It flows from who God is because he is community.
[time=1864] He is circle.
[time=1866] He creates community.
[time=1867] This is my favorite part.
[time=1868] It is his gift of himself to humans.
[time=1872] If you look around the world, the world doesn't look so great.
[time=1877] There's death and horrible things happening in sin and all this negative stuff and it's like, "God, why did you create humans?" Everything was great until you made humans.
[time=1887] Why did you do that?
[time=1888] See, God was just kicking it up there.
[time=1891] He's chilling with the Father, Son, Holy Spirit, and they're in this perfect unity together.
[time=1895] You know what?
[time=1896] That was so good and so great and so much love and so much industry.
[time=1900] You know what God said?
[time=1901] He said, "You know what?
[time=1902] We're going to make some humans and then invite them in to that community, to that circle." That's what we're going to do that.
[time=1908] We're going to invite them into that circle so that we can experience relational connecting this with our God and with each other, that is such a cool picture of what God did for
[time=1919] us.
[time=1920] It's his gift to us.
[time=1922] His interconnected relational triunity is his gift to us.
[time=1928] Therefore, making community, it's not really optional for us.
[time=1932] We need to be in community.
[time=1934] We need to be relationally connected to one another.
[time=1937] George Gallup in a poll in a story says that Americans are among the loneliest people in
[time=1944] the world.
[time=1945] This is so true and teenagers as well.
[time=1950] How could that be?
[time=1952] We work and we play and there's people all over the place.
[time=1955] There's traffic everywhere.
[time=1957] Right?
[time=1958] We're around people all the time.
[time=1959] We've got Twitter tweeters.
[time=1960] We've got Facebook and we've got all that stuff, right?
[time=1964] We're so connected, but we're so lonely because those aren't real authentic relationships.
[time=1970] Those aren't circles.
[time=1971] Those are just screens.
[time=1974] We long for these relationships.
[time=1979] I have a group of guys that I get to meet with on Wednesdays, and I love it.
[time=1985] It is so good.
[time=1986] It is so fun.
[time=1987] It's my almost one of my favorite things to do during the week.
[time=1990] You meet at somebody's house and sometimes there's food and we just talk and they ask me about marriage because they're kind of headed towards that scuff, and they ask me these really hard questions and I share a little bit and I ask them some hard questions and they share a little bit, and we just share our lives together.
[time=2005] It's pretty simple.
[time=2006] We have some scripture.
[time=2007] We want to ask one question.
[time=2009] We talked for about an hour and a half on that one question because we just long for those relational ties, those connected times because circles are better than rows.
[time=2018] See, when we're isolated from others, that is the time when we are least like God, who
[time=2025] is three but one, who is circle.
[time=2028] He exists in meaningful relationships, so we too are to exist in meaningful relationships.
[time=2036] Christ saved us so that we would live in the meaningful relationship called the church.
[time=2041] Without authentic community, the world cannot know that God sent Jesus to save it.
[time=2045] In the words of Francis Shaver, Christian community is the final apologetic.
[time=2051] When people see our relational connectedness, when people see us loving and caring and nurturing
[time=2057] for one another, there's something there.
[time=2060] It doesn't make sense and it's a witness.
[time=2064] It shows our love for one another.
[time=2066] Circles are better than rows because, well, we get to share our lives together.
[time=2077] First Thessalonians 2-8, it's my Taco Bell verse, I've said this for years, I hope you maybe you've heard me say that before, it says this in 2-8, "Just as a nursing mother cares for her children, so we cared for you because we loved you so much, we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel, but of God, but our lives as well."
[time=2097] It's just cool, we get to share our lives together, we get to talk, we get to hang out,
[time=2103] we get to sit in a circle and just share about our struggles and our joys and our scriptures and the challenges and the struggles and the great things and the bad things.
[time=2112] So important, circles are better than rows.
[time=2114] When we're in smaller settings, our community, we can serve one another.
[time=2120] We can accept one another, we can forgive one another, we can bear one another's burdens, we can be voted to one another, we can honor one another, we can teach one another, we can submit to one another, encourage one another, love one another.
[time=2135] Circles are better than rows.
[time=2138] I think it's interesting when Jesus' ministry began, he called a circle for himself, called twelve guys.
[time=2143] Hey, let's get together and change the world.
[time=2146] Small group did pretty good, right?
[time=2149] He got these guys around him, he didn't need him, but Jesus chose to be with them and teach him and pour himself into relationship with them and he could basically create his own small group, smaller setting, he'd gotten a circle, said, "Serve is a better than rows."
[time=2164] Can I give you four benefits for being in circles?
[time=2171] The first one is you can be known, so good to be known, so good to sit down with people
[time=2181] who understand where you're coming from.
[time=2184] When you share something you're struggling with, they don't jump down your throat and judge you, they get it, they understand you, it's just good to be known.
[time=2194] The second one is you can be conversational, there's something so good about conversation
[time=2201] and learning and understanding and re-hashing out what somebody said.
[time=2206] Conversation is so key to our faith development, to our relational development and our marriages
[time=2214] with our kids, conversation is huge and when you can have those circle conversations authentic
[time=2221] and real, they're going to improve every other conversation that you can get in the rest of the week.
[time=2227] Circles are better in the rows, you can be conversational, the third one is you will have context to your faith, what I mean by that is each one of us is living out a story.
[time=2237] We have a story of faith that God is writing and we're kind of co-authoring at the same time and when we sit in circles and we share with each other, your story is now affecting
[time=2247] my story and the other person's story and the other person's story and it provides context
[time=2254] to all of our stories.
[time=2256] When we're in circles it's context to our faith, now the fourth one is you will have someone to hold you accountable, we need this, every single one of us needs this, accountability
[time=2268] is huge because most of us in here, we have this desire to live for God, to run for him to go after Christ, but sometimes our desire gets overpowered by poor choices, things we
[time=2281] don't want to do and there's somebody there to grab his, whoa, nope, not doing that, hold
[time=2287] you accountable and that's why I think circles are better in the rows and a little example Tim Rockwell's going to come up and just share a little bit about his circle and why it's better than rows and now his circle surrounded him in a time when it was pretty hard and challenging for him and his family and he's going to come up and just share a little bit about his story and I think you'll enjoy it, so Tim come on up, thanks buddy.
[time=2310] Thank you.
[time=2314] So I just want to take a few minutes this morning to give testimony to the role of community
[time=2320] in a recent season for my family and we believe that community is God's design, we believe
[time=2327] that it's appropriate to be in a smaller setting, a circle where relationships can be formed
[time=2336] and people can come alongside and support and love and encourage not only us but us on them
[time=2343] as well.
[time=2346] We've been in community for a long time, years and always been a part of a small group and
[time=2353] been blessed by that about three years ago John Bars and I were sitting and he said, "I'd really like you to think about hosting a small group and you and your wife facilitating a group in your home." So we agreed to do that and that started in early 2011 and that went for about a year and it was really good and fruitful, really thankful for that time.
[time=2375] In early 2012 my wife Amy and I started thinking about hosting a young boy from Haiti, his
[time=2381] name's John Wesley and initially it was just going to be a four to six month commitment.
[time=2387] He had a small tumor in his mouth that needed to be removed so we agreed to bring him over and host him in our home for that time, facilitate his health care at Lutheran Hospital and then
[time=2398] send him back home and reunite him with his family.
[time=2403] The Lord was doing different things and that situation became a lot more complex and a lot more difficult than what we thought it was going to be initially.
[time=2413] We got John Wesley over here and the tumor had grown substantially and Lutheran Hospital
[time=2420] stabilized him, had him for two weeks and then discharged him to our care and said, "We can't do the surgery.
[time=2427] We can't remove this tumor.
[time=2429] Sorry." And so we're sitting there thinking, "What are we going to do?
[time=2436] Who are we?
[time=2438] How are we going to take this on?" And of course we knew that God was journeying through this with us but that's when our small
[time=2449] group really started to support and love and encourage us and it became very evident that he was putting that into place even a year earlier, even before we even knew that
[time=2460] this issue was going to come up.
[time=2462] And when I talk about support and encouragement and great love for us, I'm talking about meals,
[time=2469] financial support, childcare, prayers, phone calls, how's it going, that was the beauty
[time=2476] of the relationship that we were able to enjoy in that season of trying to care for John
[time=2482] and trying to figure out how we were going to help him towards health and recovery from
[time=2488] this tumor.
[time=2490] Here's this group in our living room who are willing to come alongside and it's all because God orchestrated that and God made that happen.
[time=2499] So it's great testimony to his faithfulness and his design for us to be relational on a smaller level, to do more than just sit in these pews, which is healthy, it's appropriate.
[time=2511] But there's things that I believe he's calling us to be on that.
[time=2515] What I failed to say first service and I want to say to you is that John Wesley, this little boy from Haiti, these health concerns and the things that we've gotten the privilege
[time=2526] to encounter in these recent months, that's our thing, that's what we're dealing with.
[time=2533] My guess is you have a thing, you're in a season, there's something going on.
[time=2537] It's God's design that there are people who are journeying with you, who are encouraging you, who are loving you, who are springing you on to greater obedience to him as you deal with whatever that season is.
[time=2550] And so I just thank you for the opportunity to share that this morning, I thank you for your willingness to listen.
[time=2557] Thanks to Jesse and that's our story.
[time=2561] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[time=2571] Circles are better than rows and just one point of application is in a group.
[time=2576] Find a circle, find a place where you can get connected here.
[time=2583] Don't just stop at that row, stop at that pew, but find a place, there's a couple of things that we just real quick, that we have here, we have ABFs, they meet all over this
[time=2593] place in classrooms.
[time=2594] There's a circle you can get involved with, people are going to care for you and nurture you and love on you, build relationships.
[time=2600] So those are things called small groups, some are meeting homes and some meet, I think
[time=2606] a couple meet here possibly, they meet all over during the week and it's just some people coming together to do exactly what we talked about, getting a circle and encourage one of their loved ones and their study descriptions together and you may have walked in out there, there's some balloons and those are just some new small groups that are starting, right?
[time=2624] And it's a five week, you can try it before you buy it, kind of thing, you sign up, find a group, you can kind of, you can go to this group for five weeks and if you don't like the leaders, like I don't know if the circle's right for me, then you can just, yep, ditch it, that's cool, you understand.
[time=2639] But at least jump in, give one a chance, you say, well yeah, the small group, it wasn't so great, you know, it was a bad experience, come on, put out your big boy pants and get into group, you'll get through it, it'll be okay, right?
[time=2651] If you had a bad experience, if you had a bad care cut, you didn't stop having haircuts, but you still got your haircut.
[time=2658] So if you had a bad small group experience, try a different one, try another one, circles are better than rows, there's stuff in the bulletin, there's stuff on our line to find a group for you, find a circle, that's your application for today.
[time=2672] I'm thankful that I got to be here to share that with you, and I really hope you'll check out a circle this week, get connected, so you can start running with people who want
[time=2683] to love you and care for you, circles are better than rows.
[time=2702] So if you had a bad small group experience, you'd have to be here to share that with you,
[time=2709] so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with,
[time=2723] so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with, so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with, so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with, so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with, so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with, so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with, so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with, so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with, so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with, so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with, so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with, so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with, so you can start running with people who want to love you, so you can start running with,
