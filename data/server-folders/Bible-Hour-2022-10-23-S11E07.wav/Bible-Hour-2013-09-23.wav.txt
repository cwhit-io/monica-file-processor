[time=60] >> Well, hey, good morning and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=65] It's great to have you with us as I sit here in our Bible Hour Studios.
[time=69] I can hear the band and the vocalists and the choir singing the great song.
[time=75] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=78] And it's gonna be a morning where we sing that song.
[time=81] It's gonna be a morning where we actually give our entire Blackhawk family the chance to make a 12 month commitment.
[time=88] We're calling it yes Sunday, yes Sunday.
[time=92] It's everybody here who calls Blackhawk stepping forward in kind of a hands-on
[time=98] way and saying we commit to be a part of the basic purposes of this church over the next 12 months.
[time=104] We commit to gather on a regular basis.
[time=107] We commit to connect in smaller settings.
[time=110] We commit to go in a meaningful way to enlarge his reach, God's reach through our actions, and so I'm excited about the morning.
[time=119] I can't wait to see what God has in store.
[time=121] And I thought about you all as I was driving in.
[time=124] I thought about our viewing audience, many of you.
[time=126] I know, consider this home for you.
[time=129] And so I wanna invite you to make a commitment today.
[time=132] I wanna invite you to say yes as you watch the broadcast and as you see the way we engage the people in the room, I want you to know that if you would just call us, if you would email us, if you follow me on Twitter, if you follow Blackhawk on Facebook, in whatever way you would choose, I would love personally to hear from you.
[time=153] I would love to know that as you watched today that you yourself are willing in your life and the opportunities God gives you to come and be a part of this, to gather, connect, and go, to make a commitment over these next 12 months.
[time=167] It's a one year commitment to moving away that we believe is God honoring and healthy for the church.
[time=173] And so we're grateful for you, thankful that you're tuning in.
[time=176] And I hope as you watch, you'll be willing, by the time the service is over, to come forward, if you will, and make a commitment to say yes to what God is doing in your life and in this ministry.
[time=188] Thank you so much for tuning in, God bless, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=192] [MUSIC]
[time=222] Christ is enough for me, Christ is enough for me.
[time=239] Everything I need is in you, everything I need.
[time=250] Christ might all in all, but you're at my salvation.
[time=258] [MUSIC]
[time=262] And this hope will never fail, heaven is our home.
[time=271] [MUSIC]
[time=272] Through every storm, my soul will sing.
[time=279] Jesus is here to God be the glory.
[time=287] Christ is enough for me, Christ is enough for me, everything I need is in you.
[time=308] Everything I need.
[time=315] [MUSIC]
[time=324] I have decided to follow Jesus, no turning back, no turning back.
[time=349] The cross before me, the world behind me, no turning back, no turning back.
[time=375] Christ is enough for me, Christ is enough for me, everything I need.
[time=391] Everything I need, Christ is enough for me, Christ is enough for me.
[time=414] Everything I need is in you.
[time=420] Everything I need, I have decided I have decided to follow Jesus, no turning back, no turning back.
[time=436] I have decided to follow Jesus, no turning back, no turning back.
[time=448] I have decided to follow Jesus, no turning back, no turning back, no turning back, no turning
[time=474] back, no turning back, no turning back, no turning back.
[time=495] [APPLAUSE]
[time=496] Hey, it's good to see all of you here in the room.
[time=500] I want to welcome those who are watching online on our live stream.
[time=504] I want to encourage those of you in the room.
[time=506] Make sure you tell people about that, make sure that your friends and family, whether here or abroad know that every Sunday morning, 9 and 10, 45, they can catch us live online
[time=516] at blackhawkministries.org on our live stream.
[time=520] We've got folks watching this morning from all over the world and we're grateful that they're watching and glad that you're here.
[time=527] It's good to be together.
[time=528] We come to the conclusion of a series that we've entitled "Vision." We've been talking about God's call and the scriptures, the opportunity we see in the Word of God to be a part of a ministry here in the local church that completes people.
[time=542] We have been talking about completing people.
[time=545] We've been talking about and teaching on the three spiritual disciplines, the three kind of corporate and individual practices that we've identified here at Blackhawk as being
[time=556] absolutely central to that endeavor, the endeavor of completing people, growing people, making
[time=562] disciples, those three things, being gathering, connecting and going.
[time=568] Gather connecting, go on this morning.
[time=569] We ask the question, "Will you say yes?" I'm going to give you a chance this morning as part of this family, whether you've been here for 20, 30 years or whether this is your second, third or fourth Sunday, we want to give you the chance today with the next 12 months in view to say yes.
[time=586] And I'll explain that to you as we make our way through the morning.
[time=589] But before we start, I want you to write down, get a pen out, would you?
[time=592] Get something to write with?
[time=594] Get a pen out and write on your own individual journal or write it on your iPad or make notes in your phone or use the note sheet in your bulletin.
[time=602] But I want you to write down as kind of an outline for our talk this morning, three words, one at the top, one in the middle, one at the bottom, write down, "Why?" question mark, "Why?" And then about halfway down, write down, "Who?" And then thirdly, down toward the bottom, write down, "What?" Write down the question, "What?" "Why?" "Who?" And "What?" As we begin this morning, I want to ask you what I believe to be some of the most important questions that ever could be asked in a church setting to a church family by a church leader.
[time=638] Let me say that again.
[time=639] I want to ask you this morning, a series of questions, some of the most important questions that I think could ever be asked in a church setting to a church family by a church leader.
[time=650] These are honest, thought-provoking questions that need to be asked, but more than their
[time=656] need to be asked, my friends, these are questions that most importantly must be answered.
[time=663] These are questions that must be answered.
[time=666] And please hear me.
[time=667] I ask these questions to those of you middle schoolers in the room.
[time=670] I'm asking these questions to those of you high school college, age, young men and women.
[time=675] I'm asking young families.
[time=677] I'm asking middle-aged moms and dads.
[time=679] I'm asking grandmas and grandpas.
[time=681] I'm asking everybody in this room because if you're in this room and if you're a part of this family to any degree, then how you answer these questions really does matter.
[time=694] These are important questions to answer because if, as a church, we're going to move forward in an effective, healthy and fruitful way if we're going to be effective in our efforts,
[time=704] if we're going to be healthy in our relationships, if we're going to be fruitful in that which we produce, you and I have to ask and answer these questions.
[time=715] So question number one, you ready?
[time=716] Here we go.
[time=717] Why?
[time=718] Why does the church exist?
[time=721] Why are we here?
[time=724] Why are we doing this?
[time=728] I mean, practically, why do you get up on a Sunday morning?
[time=732] I applauded first hour for their readiness to show themselves even more spiritual than the rest of you, sluggards who get up later.
[time=741] There's people getting up all times on Sunday mornings, but they're getting up and they're getting dressed and they're getting showered and they're getting kids ready and they're going through a great amount of work and effort and sacrifice.
[time=752] Why?
[time=753] Why get up on Sunday?
[time=754] Why go to your Sunday morning community or your weekly small group?
[time=757] Why teach kids by the hundreds around here, which is what we do?
[time=761] Why visit the sick?
[time=764] Why send the bus out to pick up people on a Sunday morning like we do each and every week?
[time=770] Why?
[time=771] Why support missionaries to the tune of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars?
[time=775] Why worship?
[time=776] Why give sermons?
[time=778] Why are we doing this?
[time=781] Would you open your Bibles to Ephesians chapter 3?
[time=784] You can look there in your own scriptures or on your phone or your iPad.
[time=788] However, it is you're looking at the Word this morning.
[time=791] Would you look with me in Ephesians chapter 3 verses 6 through 10?
[time=797] Let's answer this question.
[time=798] We're going to answer this question.
[time=799] Why are we doing this?
[time=800] We're going to answer it two ways.
[time=802] Here's the first way.
[time=804] Here's the first answer to that question.
[time=805] Ephesians 3 verses 6 to 10, Paul is talking about the mystery of the church.
[time=812] Paul is talking about the mystery of the gospel going forward.
[time=816] To be specific, he says in verse 6 that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow partakers.
[time=825] What does it say?
[time=826] "Fellow members of the body and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel." Stop right there.
[time=833] Just real quick, the mystery they called it was this.
[time=836] It was a mystery because early on there was this initial thinking that the gospel was simply going to be something that was going to be made available to and embraced by the Jews.
[time=847] Jews who would believe, Jews who would come to faith, Christ, Messiah, the Jewish nation, there was this thought as the church starts to unfold that maybe this was just going to be about a select group of people.
[time=860] But there was this mystery that God wants to unfold.
[time=863] And now in Paul's ministry, it starts to get unfolded.
[time=867] And what gets unfolded is that it's not just them.
[time=870] It's for who?
[time=872] It's for Gentiles.
[time=874] Some of you know in the room what a Gentile was, and if you don't, I'll just tell you
[time=880] a Gentile is anybody who's not a what, a Jew.
[time=885] So in essence, the great message, the great celebration of this day, the mystery that's being solved is that the gospel was for who, every one, everybody, everybody gets to hear
[time=899] the gospel.
[time=901] Everybody's going to get a chance to respond.
[time=903] Paul goes on talking here about the foundations of the church and its purpose of which I was made the gospel, of which I was made, Paul says, "A minister according to the gift of God's grace which was given to me, according to the working of his power, God gifts him to be in the church, revealing this mystery, preaching the gospel to the Gentiles." Verse 8, "To me," he says, "the very least of all the saints," I know you think you are.
[time=929] He thought he was.
[time=931] I think I am.
[time=932] What a great way of saying that, the very least of all the saints, that's the humility behind
[time=939] the gospel that's needed.
[time=941] This grace was given to Paul to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ.
[time=951] Paul in the church using his gift gets to preach to the world the unfathomable riches
[time=958] of Christ and to bring to light what is the, watch this, the administration of the mystery
[time=966] which for ages had been hidden in God who created all things.
[time=971] What that's really saying is the plan and to bring to light what is God's plan so that
[time=978] the manifold, verse 10, so that the manifold, the far reaching across the board, wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the
[time=992] heavenly places, the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places, the gospel going forward,
[time=1000] the role of the church, the proclamation of the good news.
[time=1004] The church is God's chosen instrument to make this known and the church stands not only
[time=1010] against the authorities and principalities here on earth but even it says they're the
[time=1016] authorities and principalities in the heavenlies.
[time=1019] Oh, what a, what a challenging opportunity we find ourselves in.
[time=1024] This passage teaches us that God designed the church to carry the gospel forward both
[time=1030] indeed and in word to everyone, to everyone, Black Hawk, I want to just make sure you
[time=1036] hear this.
[time=1037] I want to make sure you not only hear it, I want to hopefully make sure that you believe this.
[time=1043] I want to make sure you hear it.
[time=1044] I also want to make sure that you're willing to embrace this.
[time=1048] I hope, especially on a Sunday on a week like this in light of the last three weeks or so
[time=1054] as we talk about our future, I hope you embrace this.
[time=1059] And I hope you feel it deeply.
[time=1060] The gospel is for everyone.
[time=1066] The gospel, this good news, this message of redemption, this message of healing, this message of being able to be at peace with God, everybody now gets to hear that.
[time=1077] It doesn't matter who you are and it doesn't matter where you've been.
[time=1081] It doesn't matter what ethnicity you are, doesn't matter how much money you make in a given year, doesn't matter where you vacation or what you drove this morning.
[time=1090] We believe as a church that the gospel gets to be proclaimed and delivered to everybody
[time=1096] and you and I ought to be willing to do and engage ourselves in that very thing.
[time=1101] Remember, God didn't design.
[time=1102] This is what this passage teaches us.
[time=1104] God didn't design for the kingdom of God to go forward through any other Christian organization,
[time=1112] through any other individual, through any other effort.
[time=1115] The church in God's design is the primary redemptive agent of salvation and change.
[time=1124] The primary agent that God chose to deliver the good news, the church, you, you, me, and
[time=1133] this effort.
[time=1134] This is why we do this because it's God's design.
[time=1138] I don't know if I mentioned that.
[time=1139] So there, I'm mentioning it.
[time=1140] There's your fill in right there.
[time=1142] Why number one, because it's God's design, the church and the way he designed it to function,
[time=1149] it's the way he chose to see the kingdom moving forward.
[time=1153] Secondly, why are we doing this?
[time=1155] Secondly, look at Luke 15.
[time=1157] Look at Luke 15.
[time=1158] I wish we had time to read through all 32 verses, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.
[time=1164] Here's another reason why we're doing all that we do.
[time=1168] We're trying to imitate as the Scripture calls us to.
[time=1173] We're trying to individually, and we're trying to, as a church, imitate and follow and design
[time=1180] our lives and our ministry after the way in which we saw our Lord think and choose and
[time=1187] do ministry.
[time=1188] And here in Luke 15, we see something that's so important.
[time=1193] Now all the tax collectors, it says in Luke 15, one.
[time=1197] Now all the tax collectors and all the sinners were coming near to him.
[time=1203] It says, we're coming near him to listen to him.
[time=1207] And I'll have you stop right there just for a moment.
[time=1210] We are trying to encourage you to be like him.
[time=1213] I would hope you would be wanting me to be like him.
[time=1217] And I got to tell you, that's a very convicting verse when I think about and I hope you'll think about who's near you.
[time=1225] Who's drawn to you?
[time=1229] Who are you with?
[time=1232] What did it say there?
[time=1233] It said, both the Pharisees verse two and the, both the Pharisees and the scribes began
[time=1239] to grumble saying, this man receives sinners and he does the one thing in that culture that was most intimate, he ate with them.
[time=1248] So I start thinking about that, who am I eating with, who's because of me and the way I am
[time=1255] and the things I say and the way I carry and conduct myself, like who's drawn to me?
[time=1261] Those who were drawn to Jesus were the ones on the way, they were on the way outside.
[time=1266] They were the dirty ones.
[time=1268] They were the troubled ones.
[time=1270] They were the ones that they weren't in, they were out, they were distanced, many of them despised and I just love the fact that they were drawn to him, they were listening to him and he was spending time with them, receiving them, eating with them and the Pharisees and the scribes are like, what's going on with this?
[time=1286] And he says, I'll tell you exactly what's going on with this.
[time=1292] So he told them this parable saying, what man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the 99 in the open pasture and go after the one
[time=1306] which is lost until he finds it, 99 in the open pasture, we can't get into all this but
[time=1314] I just want you to know, that signifies urgency.
[time=1320] He's responsible for those 99 in the open pasture, they're like fair game, if he was going to take time and be methodical, he put them all away but there's one missing, just one and he realizes one is missing and off he goes with 99 left in the open pasture until
[time=1341] he finds it when he has found that he lays it on his shoulders rejoicing and when he comes home he calls together his friends and his neighbors saying to them, rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost and then Jesus looks at those scribes and he
[time=1359] looks at those Pharisees and he says, I tell you that in the same way there will be more joy in heaven for one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous persons who need no repentance.
[time=1371] Why do we do this?
[time=1372] Because write it down because lost people need the Lord.
[time=1378] Lost people desperately need the Lord.
[time=1380] People on the outside of the family of God, those who haven't fully surrendered their hearts and lives to Christ, guess what?
[time=1388] They matter to God and I'm not chastising you and I'm not judging you, I'm just telling
[time=1395] you something that you and I need to hear again and again and again and those of us on the inside need to hear it and you know what, if you're here today or you're watching online and you're not in, you need to hear this, he loves you.
[time=1411] People who aren't in, they matter greatly to God.
[time=1416] You mean a great deal to him, whatever you're doing or whatever you've done, whatever struggles you're experiencing and whatever that looks like, listen to me, God's not mad at you.
[time=1428] God's not condemning you, God's not angry with you, God is climbing rocks and mountains
[time=1438] and going through valleys to find you because you matter that much to him.
[time=1445] He searches for and comes after you like a shepherd would a wandering sheep.
[time=1452] In verse 8 in Luke 15, 8 it goes from a sheep to a coin, a coin gets lost and there's this woman and she devotes this all out all night search for this one coin because it was so
[time=1464] valuable to her in verse 11 of Luke 15, it moves from a lost sheep and a lost coin and
[time=1471] then in verse 11 we see it's a loving patient waiting, the loving patient waiting of a father for a lost son, son we've grown to know as the prodigal.
[time=1483] So question number one, why all this, why all of this, why this church effort because
[time=1489] it's God's plan?
[time=1490] Number one, it's God's plan for the church.
[time=1495] It's God's plan for Jews that would listen in everyone else, Gentiles, that the church would have the unspeakable privilege of making known the riches of Christ and the wisdom
[time=1505] of God.
[time=1506] That's how he designed it and because people that mattered to God are lost.
[time=1511] People are tired, people are weary, people are hurting, people are confused.
[time=1516] They're abused, they're addicted and they're dying and they need the Lord.
[time=1524] And so like Luke 15, we with his help and by his grace go after them.
[time=1532] That's why you get up, that's why we send out the bus, that's why we teach the kids.
[time=1537] That's why we give ourselves to this because it's God's design and because people desperately need the gospel.
[time=1543] Secondly, right down, if you haven't already, right down who, question number two is who?
[time=1548] You say what do you mean by who?
[time=1550] In God's design, who moves this thing forward?
[time=1552] Let me ask you that.
[time=1554] Everything I just described, in God's design, who's on the hook for this getting done?
[time=1562] Who?
[time=1565] Who makes it really happen?
[time=1566] Let's stick with the, let's stick with where we've been in today's discussion.
[time=1570] Who makes the riches of Christ known?
[time=1575] Who is it at the end of the day that tells the world about the wisdom of God?
[time=1581] Who goes out and brings back the lost sheep?
[time=1585] Who?
[time=1587] Who's responsibility is it, who does this rest with, this ministry of the church?
[time=1593] Who loves, who serves, who disciples, who encourages, who walks through crisis, who guides through
[time=1599] heartache, who celebrates the progress, who warns of impending danger.
[time=1604] Who is it?
[time=1605] Is it me?
[time=1607] Would your answer to that question be, "Kelly, it's you." Am I, or Webster, or Jesse, or Josh, or people on our staff, is it me?
[time=1619] Is it us?
[time=1620] Are we responsible for that?
[time=1624] Or is it you?
[time=1629] Answer?
[time=1631] Actually it's both, but the truth is, in many ways, in many ways, it's mainly you.
[time=1640] In many ways, this whole thing rests with you.
[time=1647] As always, let's allow the Scripture to inform us and to give us guidance.
[time=1653] Would you look with me in Ephesians chapter 4, just go over a chapter.
[time=1657] The Ephesians 4, 11, Ephesians 4, 11, and 12 is where we see this.
[time=1662] We see it in other places, but let me read this to you.
[time=1665] It says, and he gave some, as it relates to the church and its ministry, as it relates to the church and who's responsible for what, look what it says, and he gave some as apostles
[time=1675] and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and some as teachers.
[time=1681] You can stop right there.
[time=1682] I'm so grateful that I can't even just look back at the history of this church.
[time=1687] Forget the history of the church in general.
[time=1689] That's packed with examples of this.
[time=1691] But think with me just for a moment about the way in which this is true, what you just read right here.
[time=1699] Over 40 years ago, in an application way, hear me, when it talks about he gave some as apostles,
[time=1707] there were apostles, apostles were those who started things.
[time=1712] Apostles were those who were at the beginning of something.
[time=1714] They had a unique gift to start, and I think about over 40 years ago, a young pastor named
[time=1720] David Jeremiah showed up and they got a trailer in the parking lot across the street and about
[time=1726] six families and they faithfully dreamed a dream of what a church could look like on this part of town when there was nothing in this part of town.
[time=1735] I think about the way God in that way gave Blackhawk some apostleship.
[time=1739] I think about how it goes on to say he gave some as evangelists.
[time=1743] I think about the six, seven years that Mitchell Cruz was here on our staff.
[time=1748] I think about the heart of an evangelist that Mitch had and the way that that ministered to and encouraged and inspired this body.
[time=1755] I think about how he gave some as pastors and teachers.
[time=1759] I think about Rick Hawks.
[time=1761] I think about some of the gifting he's given me on the pastoring, shepherding front.
[time=1766] I think about teachers like Russell Moore, teachers like Steve Webster.
[time=1771] There has been example after example, all through the years of this place of God doing exactly what he said in verse 11, so that what?
[time=1782] So that verse 12, he gave the church all those guys for the equipping of you, for the equipping
[time=1790] of the saints, for the work of service to the building up of the body of Christ.
[time=1798] The ministry of the church is yours.
[time=1806] This passage shows us the way God designed the church to succeed, the way God designed
[time=1813] the church to be fruitful, and I want to just say something to you there.
[time=1818] Please make no mistake, my friends, please don't be confused on this.
[time=1822] God designed the church to succeed.
[time=1827] Certainly he knew there would be challenges.
[time=1829] Certainly God knew there would be struggles, but please make no mistake.
[time=1833] God designed the church to do well.
[time=1837] God designed the church to go forward.
[time=1841] God designed the church to expand.
[time=1843] He designed the church, and when the church functions in the way that he designed it, he has every intention of seeing that be fruitful and seeing that be blessed.
[time=1855] Don't ever believe for one minute that all the divisive, dysfunctional, mean-spirited,
[time=1862] small-minded, closed-off, stuck, dying churches we've seen from time to time in your past
[time=1869] and mind.
[time=1872] Don't ever believe for one minute that that has anything to do with what God wanted.
[time=1880] It has nothing to do with what God wanted.
[time=1883] God wants me's to faithfully teach and equip yous.
[time=1890] So all of you can do the ministry of the church.
[time=1894] Me's teaching and discipling yous so that yous can carry the gospel forward so yous can
[time=1903] make God known to them a wandering world that desperately needs the Lord.
[time=1908] It really is in so many ways.
[time=1911] It really is on you.
[time=1914] And that's why we're trying to encourage you.
[time=1917] It's why we're trying to build you up.
[time=1919] That's why we're trying to help you grow.
[time=1920] It's why we're trying to cast this vision for you because in many ways it's up to you.
[time=1926] Eugene Peterson, who's a tremendous author, did the Bible translation called the message, Eugene Peterson said, "This people like to make their pastoral leaders feel necessary
[time=1937] so that they can cop out of their responsibilities in the priesthood of all believers."
[time=1944] If we rediscover our pastoral call, however, we know that we are merely aquippers, prodders,
[time=1951] encouragers, and promoters of all the people so that each one fulfills his or her vocation
[time=1960] in the church.
[time=1961] This is really true.
[time=1963] Then no one is more necessary than any others, but all are set free to be church, to live
[time=1971] in a way corresponding to the priesthood to which each Christian has been called.
[time=1977] That's why we've said to you for years you have got to be willing to be a priest that goes because it is the priesthood of this family.
[time=1986] It is the priesthood that God has given you this privilege of representing him that we want so badly to see you fulfill.
[time=1994] It is the only way this thing moves forward.
[time=1997] And number three, so that what?
[time=2001] So that what's the reason?
[time=2003] We know why it's God's design and lost people matter to God.
[time=2008] We know who, it's mostly you, but we have a significant contribution to make so we've got to make it so that what?
[time=2016] What?
[time=2017] For what reason?
[time=2019] Like what's the goal?
[time=2021] What's our end game?
[time=2023] What is it that all of this is supposed to lead to?
[time=2026] You know, it's interesting for me as I spend time and I have over the years trying to understand
[time=2032] how other ministries, how other churches specifically view their opportunity.
[time=2038] I love reading about and I love listening to other church leaders talk about how they view their end game.
[time=2046] What it is at the end of the day that they're really after with all of this activity and all of this organization, what are we trying to accomplish?
[time=2056] There are mission statements that I love to read.
[time=2059] There's one, some friends of ours have and I've had the team put it up on the screen.
[time=2065] This is quite a statement and as I show it to you, I want you to stop and think just
[time=2071] for a moment.
[time=2073] Just stop with me here as we jump into this for just a few minutes.
[time=2077] I want you to think about how difficult this is.
[time=2083] I know many of you have jobs in a lot of different settings and sectors and I know many of you have jobs.
[time=2089] They're very, very challenging.
[time=2091] I get that.
[time=2092] I'm not trying to diminish you at all.
[time=2097] This is really, really difficult stuff.
[time=2099] One church says it this way.
[time=2100] Their whole existence, their whole purpose is to turn with God's help, to turn people
[time=2106] far from God, to turn people far from God, far from God means a lot of things, far from
[time=2115] God means they're angry at God, far from God means they're antagonistic toward God.
[time=2121] Far from God means they could care less about God, far from God means they could probably care less about you.
[time=2129] Far from God is way, way, way down the road and this place they're trying to turn people
[time=2135] who are far from God into fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ.
[time=2142] Now, you don't have to be that bright.
[time=2146] You certainly don't need 26 years of ministry experience.
[time=2149] None of us have to even bat our eyes.
[time=2152] That's really what?
[time=2154] That's really hard.
[time=2158] We say it at Blackhawk like this and I love the way we say it.
[time=2161] We exist, our mission is that we are and our elders and our staff kind of put this together a few years ago.
[time=2167] We strive to present every person.
[time=2170] We strive.
[time=2171] We work hard to present every person complete in Christ, not just a few of you, not just most of you.
[time=2177] We're trying to with every single person God gives us present you someday and we will have to present you.
[time=2183] We will have to answer for our ministry with you complete in Christ.
[time=2189] I mean, just a few thoughts, to me while those statements sound very compelling, I will say
[time=2195] they sound honestly very, very difficult.
[time=2197] It is very challenging to see someone far from God come to a place of full surrender.
[time=2204] I had a very successful businessman tell me years ago, he said, Kelly, there's no comparison
[time=2211] between you and me.
[time=2212] We were good friends and he was just shooting straight.
[time=2214] He said, there's no comparison between you and me.
[time=2216] What you do is infinitely harder than what I do.
[time=2220] I sell people what they want and they want me to.
[time=2225] I liked how he said that.
[time=2226] I sell people what they want and they want me to.
[time=2229] You're selling people what they need, but they want nothing at all to do with it and quite honestly, he said they want nothing to do with you, which is true.
[time=2240] It's interesting.
[time=2243] Sometimes, I bump into people at a grocery store and all of a sudden, they're going a different way and moving down a different aisle and I'm like, hey, how you do?
[time=2252] Well, maybe not.
[time=2254] All right.
[time=2255] Maybe they left and I didn't know it.
[time=2256] Maybe I said something and they're bothered, but it's a challenging endeavor.
[time=2263] Back to the two mission statements, you'll see them on the screen and as you look at those statements and how challenging they are, it's important to note that these statements are simply wordsmith remakes of Matthew 28.
[time=2276] They are wordsmith remakes of Colossians 1 and Ephesians 4.
[time=2280] And look at, back to our text, look at Ephesians 4, 13.
[time=2284] Here's the end game.
[time=2285] Paul says, "He gave some as apostles, some as prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers to equip and build up the use so you all can do the ministry of the church."
[time=2296] What was the end game?
[time=2297] Verse 13, "Until we all attain," there it is.
[time=2301] Make your pen.
[time=2302] And I want you just to make little notes.
[time=2304] Until we all attain to the unity of the faith, make a little note right there, unity of the faith.
[time=2310] Until we all attain to the knowledge of the Son of God, make a little note there, knowledge of the Son of God.
[time=2316] Until we all attain to a mature man, until we're all mature, make a little note, little
[time=2322] notch there, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[time=2330] Measure the fullness of Christ, make a little note there.
[time=2334] Four things, unity, knowledge, maturity, fullness, unity, knowledge, maturity, fullness.
[time=2343] This in Ephesians 4 gives us the, so what, what are we trying to do?
[time=2348] There you go, unity.
[time=2350] Let's look at this.
[time=2351] You look at this with me, unity.
[time=2353] The end game here, the end result is that there should be unity among us.
[time=2358] What does it say in the text?
[time=2359] It says unity of the faith.
[time=2363] Unity of the faith.
[time=2364] Listen, this is our commitment to each other.
[time=2368] Unity is your committed to me and I'm committed to you.
[time=2371] Unity is you love me and I love you.
[time=2373] Unity is I care about you.
[time=2375] You care about me and we're in this together and there's not much of anything that's going to come in between us because we're unified.
[time=2383] But look at what it says in the text, it says in the text, unity of the faith.
[time=2389] The faith, unity here is our commitment to each other based on our commitment to this.
[time=2396] Please don't miss this.
[time=2398] Our unity in this place is based upon our mutual commitment to the foundational principles
[time=2406] in this.
[time=2407] This is what unifies us.
[time=2410] This is what keeps us together.
[time=2412] Our mutual commitment to this.
[time=2417] So let me ask you a question.
[time=2420] What should divide us?
[time=2425] What in the world should ever transpire that would ever lead you to leave this family?
[time=2435] That should according to what we're reading in Ephesians 4, what should divide family?
[time=2442] What is it that should ever lead you to separate from this?
[time=2446] Or quite frankly, you're not the only ones who could leave.
[time=2450] What have I left you?
[time=2452] What would ever lead me to say to you in this place after 18 years, I'm gone.
[time=2459] I'm done.
[time=2462] Change yourself another me.
[time=2467] I could leave.
[time=2471] According to what we're seeing today, what would lead us to experience something like
[time=2477] that?
[time=2478] It would have to be something in here.
[time=2482] It would have to be the elders telling me to preach that there's more than one way to salvation other than Christ.
[time=2489] It would mean the elders telling me to teach that the church isn't God's chosen instrument.
[time=2494] It would be the elders telling me that there's a whole different way to counsel families.
[time=2502] It would have to be something in here that is clear and biblical and them coming to me saying we want you to teach this differently and I would say goodbye.
[time=2511] It would have to be you coming upon something in here that was absolutely contradictory
[time=2517] to this.
[time=2518] This is what divides us and yet the sad truth is this isn't what divides us.
[time=2527] What ends up dividing us in the church today?
[time=2532] What ends up dividing us even in this church?
[time=2536] It's not this.
[time=2541] It's carpet color.
[time=2543] It's whatever.
[time=2546] It's what you or I like or don't like.
[time=2551] It's opinion.
[time=2554] How sad.
[time=2557] God says here that we are unified in the faith in this and this is what keeps us together
[time=2563] and this is what moves us forward.
[time=2566] It says we're to be growing in knowledge, deep into understanding.
[time=2572] The fact is you should know more.
[time=2574] You should know more today than you did yesterday about the unfathomable riches of Christ and
[time=2580] the wisdom of God.
[time=2581] You should know more about your faith.
[time=2583] That's why we beg you to go to the apologetic seminar.
[time=2586] It's why we implore you to sign up for a growth group.
[time=2589] It's why we ask you faithfully to be connected in a smaller setting where you can engage in growth because the knowledge of God and the knowledge of his word, oh the benefit it brings
[time=2600] to your life.
[time=2601] There should be an increased unity among us.
[time=2603] There should be an increased knowledge, maturity that speaks to wisdom.
[time=2608] All the church's efforts are to lead to increased levels of discernment and insight, the choices you make as an individual, as a family, the decisions you make ought to be marked increasingly
[time=2619] as the days go by, by an increased wisdom and maturity, fullness.
[time=2625] The idea here is the tape measure.
[time=2627] The fullness of Christ, you take the tape measure and you measure Christ.
[time=2632] You and I, as we keep moving down this road called church, we ought to be seeing in you.
[time=2637] You ought to be being measured higher and higher and higher.
[time=2641] There ought to be a greater depth.
[time=2644] There ought to be a deepened sincerity.
[time=2646] There ought to be a broadened understanding, your character and who you are, more and more like him, measured the measure of the fullness, of the stature of Christ.
[time=2658] Why?
[time=2659] Who?
[time=2660] What?
[time=2661] And we believe today that's the best way.
[time=2664] We believe today the very best way for all of you to help us do all of what we've talked about this morning is for you to make a serious and significant all-encompassing commitment this morning to gather, connect and go.
[time=2676] These are the settings within which we want to continue to help you and equip you to be
[time=2682] the priests that God has called you to be.
[time=2684] We can't just talk about it at some point.
[time=2686] We've got to roll up our sleeves and do it.
[time=2689] All three disciplines.
[time=2691] You and me, all of us, watch this, hands, hands on, sleeves rolled up and hands on in
[time=2699] this ministry.
[time=2700] There has to be ownership by you if this thing's going to go forward in a way that honors him.
[time=2706] This effort is yours.
[time=2707] With all of its weaknesses aside, with all of our issues aside, we want to be completed and we want to see others completed so we will commit today.
[time=2715] That is our hope.
[time=2716] I'm going to ask the band to come on up now and get ready.
[time=2719] We will commit today.
[time=2720] We will say yes today to 12 months.
[time=2723] Listen, to 12 months of gathering, connecting and going.
[time=2728] It's like we're renewing membership in a sense, but really this goes beyond membership.
[time=2734] This is you in the depths of your heart as an individual.
[time=2737] This is you in the depths of your heart as a family being willing to stand this morning and say we will honor our place in this that God has created called the church.
[time=2750] I'm going to ask you in just a moment as we sing and as we worship to make your way to these tables.
[time=2755] We've got tables in the front.
[time=2756] We've got tables in the back down here.
[time=2758] We've got tables up top and we're going to ask you to give us your hand print today.
[time=2764] Those of you watching online live stream, you can text in, there's a number on the screen.
[time=2770] You can actually text in your yes.
[time=2773] If you want to commit with us, we'd love to have that commitment.
[time=2775] There were about eight or nine first hour, one from Uganda that chimed in.
[time=2781] We want to give you a chance to give us your hand print today.
[time=2783] There's going to be people at the tables.
[time=2786] We're going to give you a chance to leave something that's very unique, very personal.
[time=2790] Your hand print.
[time=2792] We're going to frame these canvases and we're going to hang these things here in the room in the next 12 months as a constant reminder of your willingness and your readiness to help us move forward because it really is on you.
[time=2806] Our hope is that from the young ones to the older ones in the room, there will be a spirit of unity in this place that would move you not only to put your hand print on the canvas, but to continue to put your hand print on the life, the everyday life of this ministry.
[time=2823] There's cards at the tables.
[time=2826] I'm going to ask every volunteer at the table to make sure that you get a card and on this card you take it with you, it says I said yes on September 29th to 12 months of gathering,
[time=2838] connecting and going and we'll explain this to you at the end this morning.
[time=2842] But as Jonathan and Penny and the band as they lead us in this great hymn of the faith,
[time=2850] I have decided to follow Jesus will you contemplate and will you make your way impossibly down
[time=2856] to the front and will you commit with us as a leadership to do these very things.
[time=2861] Let's worship our God together and let's make a commitment to our Lord.
[time=2868] I have decided to follow Jesus, I have decided to follow Jesus, I have decided to
[time=2893] follow Jesus, no turning back, no turning back, no turning back, no turning back, no turning
[time=2918] back, no turning back, no turning back, where you leave me, I will follow, where you leave
[time=2932] me, I will follow Jesus, take me down that road, where you leave me, I will follow, where
[time=2941] you leave me, I will go, where you leave me, I will follow, anywhere Lord I will go,
[time=2951] I have decided to follow Jesus, I have decided to follow Jesus, I have decided to follow Jesus,
[time=2971] no turning back, no turning back, the world behind me, the world behind me, the cross
[time=2981] before me, the world behind me, the cross before me, the world behind me, the cross
[time=2993] before me, no turning back, no turning back, where you leave me, I will follow, where you
[time=3005] leave me, I will go, where you leave me, I will follow, Jesus, take me down that road, where
[time=3014] you leave me, I will follow, where you leave me, I will go, where you leave me, I will
[time=3022] follow, anywhere Lord I will go, even if I walk alone, Lord this I choose to do,
[time=3052] I will not look back, I'll follow no one else but you, even if I walk alone, Lord this
[time=3096] Lord this I choose to do, I will not look back, I'll follow no one else but you, I'll follow
[time=3120] you, anywhere, anywhere, I'll follow you, I'll follow you, I'll follow you, I'll follow
[time=3132] you, anywhere, oh where you leave me, where you leave me, I will follow, where you leave
[time=3140] me, I will go, where you leave me, I will follow, Jesus, take me down that road, where
[time=3148] you leave me, I will follow, where you leave me, I will go, where you leave me, I will follow,
[time=3157] anywhere Lord I will go, where you leave me, I will follow, where you leave me, I will
[time=3166] go, where you leave me, I will follow, Jesus, take me down that road, where you leave me,
[time=3173] I will follow, where you leave me, I will go, where you leave me, I will follow, anywhere
[time=3182] Lord I will go, yes I will go, Lord I will go, say I will go, I have decided to follow
[time=3198] you Lord, I have decided to follow you Lord, I have decided to follow you Lord, no turning
[time=3214] back, no turning back, no turning back, no turning back, no turning back, no turning
[time=3237] back.
[time=3238] Let me just encourage you with this, these cards are really important and so if you got back to your seat and you didn't get one of the cards, please just make your way back up and would you grab one or two, we will go over those at the end but really important that you have one of the I committed cards, so grateful for your help with this, so thankful
[time=3258] and so encouraged by your willingness to participate, we are going to sing one more song, sing it with all your heart, if you want to just stand and let's lift our voices to God and end our time this morning with one last great proclamation of our love to Him.
[time=3274] Build your King down here, let the darkness show your mighty hand, heal our streets and
[time=3290] land, set your church on fire in this nation back, changing atmosphere, build your King
[time=3305] down here, we pray, come set your ruling land, in our hearts again, increasing our sweet
[time=3321] way, unwed a while we may, come set our hearts a place we hope, like while we are in our
[time=3337] house, we are your church, we need your power in us, we seek your Kingdom first, we hunger
[time=3354] and we first, we fear to waste our lives, for our joy and the prize, to see the captain
[time=3366] hearts release, the hurt, the sick, the poor, and peace, we lay down our lives for Heaven's
[time=3377] love, in our hearts, we pray, remind this earth, build your King down here, let the darkness
[time=3399] show your mighty hand, heal our streets and land, set your church on fire in this nation
[time=3413] back in this nation back in this nation back in this nation back in this nation back in
[time=3464] build your Kingdom, build your Kingdom here, let the darkness show your mighty hand, heal
[time=3476] our streets and land, set your church on fire in this nation back in this nation back
[time=3486] in this nation back in this nation back in this nation back in this nation back in this
