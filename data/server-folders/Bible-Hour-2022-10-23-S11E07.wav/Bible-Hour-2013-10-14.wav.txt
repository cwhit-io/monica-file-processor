[time=42] Here you go.
[time=43] We look together for our girl.
[time=47] You are lovely.
[time=49] You give us more than we deserve.
[time=53] You are unfailing.
[time=55] And we humble and conquer our Savior.
[time=61] Give me your future and shake your heart.
[time=66] By your power, we will not be shaken.
[time=71] We will not be silent.
[time=74] Tin is how unless our God is for us.
[time=80] We will not be broken.
[time=84] We will not be defeated.
[time=87] Death is how unless our God is for us.
[time=94] [MUSIC]
[time=106] Consider all that He has done, our city carried.
[time=112] And by His rules we will work on.
[time=116] And now we stand reading.
[time=118] Then we humble and conquer our Savior.
[time=124] Give me your future and shake your heart.
[time=128] By your power, we will not be shaken.
[time=133] And we will not be silent.
[time=137] It is how unless our God is for us.
[time=143] We will not be broken.
[time=146] He won't be defeated.
[time=149] Death is how unless our God is for us.
[time=158] That's right, just like Kelly said, we got a chance to shout this morning.
[time=162] Let's shout.
[time=163] Let's sing to our God for the whole found in His love.
[time=167] And we will sing.
[time=170] Let's sing out.
[time=173] Let's sing for the whole.
[time=176] We're found in His love.
[time=180] And we will sing.
[time=183] Let's sing out.
[time=186] Let's sing to our God.
[time=190] Oh, we will sing.
[time=196] Sing out.
[time=199] Let's sing for the whole found in His love.
[time=205] Oh, sing.
[time=208] Sing out.
[time=218] Oh, we will not be shaken.
[time=222] We will not be silent.
[time=225] It is how unless our God is for us.
[time=231] And we will not be broken.
[time=236] He won't be defeated.
[time=239] Death is how unless our God is for us.
[time=244] We will not be shaken.
[time=251] It is how unless our God is for us.
[time=257] We will not be broken.
[time=260] He won't be defeated.
[time=263] Death is how unless our God is for us.
[time=271] Let's sing out.
[time=281] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=287] Your perfect love is casting our fear.
[time=293] Even though I call in the middle of the storms of us alive.
[time=299] I won't turn back, I know you are near.
[time=304] And I will feel a little before my God is with me.
[time=317] And if my God is with me.
[time=323] But whom then shall I fear?
[time=326] And then shall I fear?
[time=331] Oh, no, you never let go.
[time=334] Through the storm and through the storm.
[time=337] Oh, no, you never let go.
[time=340] And every high, every low, oh, no.
[time=345] You never let go, Lord, you never let go of me.
[time=355] I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on.
[time=362] A glorious light beyond your prayer.
[time=368] There will be an end to these troubles, but until that day comes.
[time=375] We'll live to know you're here on the earth.
[time=380] I will feel no need.
[time=386] Oh, my God is with me.
[time=392] And if my God is with me.
[time=397] Sing it out, Church.
[time=399] Who then shall I fear?
[time=406] Oh, no, you never let go.
[time=409] Through the storm and through the storm.
[time=412] Oh, no, you never let go.
[time=415] And every high, every low, oh, no.
[time=420] You never let go, Lord, you never let go of me.
[time=426] We're singing, oh, no, you never let go.
[time=434] Through the storm, oh, no.
[time=439] You never let go, every high, every low, oh, no.
[time=445] You never let go, Lord, you never let go of me.
[time=451] I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on.
[time=461] And there will be an end to these troubles, but until that day comes.
[time=467] Make this your prayer.
[time=469] Still, I will praise you.
[time=478] So I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on.
[time=486] There will be an end to these troubles, but until that day comes.
[time=494] Still, I will praise you.
[time=503] All God's people, sing it out.
[time=506] Oh, no, you never let go.
[time=509] Through the storm, oh, no.
[time=514] You never let go, every high, every low, oh, no.

[time=534] Through the storm, through the storm, oh, no.
[time=539] You never let go, every high, every low, oh, no.
[time=545] You never let go, Lord, you never let go of me.
[time=553] Lord, you never let go of me.
[time=580] You're blood, speaks a better word.
[time=586] From all the interclaims I've heard upon this earth,
[time=592] speaks righteousness from me, and stands in my defense.
[time=598] Jesus, it's your blood.
[time=602] It's your blood.
[time=605] Through your blood, speaks a better word.
[time=611] From all the interclaims I've heard upon this earth,
[time=617] speaks righteousness from me, and stands in my defense.
[time=623] Jesus, it's your blood.
[time=631] What can't watch away our sins?
[time=637] What can make us whole again?
[time=644] It's nothing but the blood.
[time=647] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[time=657] What can one turn to your arsenal?
[time=663] What come as the friends of God?
[time=669] It's nothing but your blood.
[time=673] Nothing but your blood, King Jesus.
[time=687] What can one turn to your arsenal?
[time=829] Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=831] It's great to be with you and I'm thankful for the opportunity we have each and every week.
[time=837] I hope help you grow in your faith.
[time=841] And as I think about and as we think about growing here at Blackhawk there is a time of year, actually two times a year, that we really get excited about when we think about spiritual progress.
[time=852] And that is the five week offerings.
[time=854] It happens in the fall and in the spring.
[time=856] The five week offerings of what we call our Grow Groups.
[time=860] And I want to tell you about the Grow Groups today because while many people within the kind of the normal flow of Blackhawk on a weekly basis will sign up and are signing up for this year's Grow Groups I want to make sure that you know, those of you in our viewing audience, that you are more than welcome to come.
[time=878] We've even scheduled them for Thursday nights while there are a couple of them on Sundays, Sunday mornings.
[time=884] The bulk of this fall's Grow Groups are on Thursday evenings.
[time=888] And I'd love for you to go to our website at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=892] And I'd like for you to find on the front page there the section about Grow Groups.
[time=897] And you can find a listing of those groups.
[time=900] You can find the time and we would love nothing more on a Thursday night than to have hundreds of you who call Blackhawk comb via the broadcast come and be a part of a smaller setting where your faith and your understanding of God and His Word your understanding and your insight into a specific topic whatever one you might choose is going to be deepened and expanded.
[time=925] You're going to have the chance to grow.
[time=927] I believe with all my heart that if you're not growing spiritually you're dying and that's an option we don't want for you.
[time=934] We want you to grow and so I hope you'll come.
[time=937] Even if you're not here on Sundays we'd love to have you on Thursdays.
[time=941] They begin this week and if you miss a week it's okay.
[time=946] Come and join us for the next four.
[time=948] But come and be a part of our Grow Group offering on Thursday nights and Sunday mornings.
[time=954] And we'll love having you be a part of it.
[time=956] God bless you.
[time=957] And again as always we hope to see you soon.

[time=3350] (gentle guitar music) - Hey, well, let's do this.
[time=3359] We started off the morning talking about
[time=3365] the Word of God and it's called to us to be loud, to shout and to yell, to dance and to sing.
[time=3374] And let's do this, let's just end the morning.
[time=3378] Well, in the morning, just in quiet, I'm gonna have Craig just play just ever so slightly.
[time=3383] And I wanna just give you the other end of that because both I think honor God and both need to be practiced.
[time=3391] So just take one minute here and in the quietness of this room, remember as we go that it was his kindness that saved you.
[time=3402] It was the kindness of God that rescued you.
[time=3408] Thank God he didn't have any parameters when he was dealing with you and me, amen?
[time=3415] And we lift that up high as the song said.
[time=3419] We lift it up and we leave this place lifting up the unspeakable kindness of the Lord.
[time=3425] Our Father in heaven, we are grateful.
[time=3429] For the quiet moments and the loud ones,
[time=3435] the chance to, with full voice and full heart, shout and clap and dance and sing as the word of God calls us to as thankful people and God we're grateful.
[time=3448] For moments of meditation where all we can hear and all we can sense is the whisper of your spirit and the truth that now runs through our hearts and minds
[time=3464] as we've taken it in these last 30, 40 minutes.
[time=3469] God, I pray that as a family we would leave this place ready to extend kindness without parameter.
[time=3476] I pray God that we would come back, all of us.
[time=3480] We bring a friend next time and hear even more about this story and the way that it should shape and frame up our lives and our view of those who you bring across our path.
[time=3492] Oh God, may we leave today and not walk on the other side of the road.
[time=3499] May we encounter face to face every opportunity you bring our way.
[time=3506] And may we respond not with arrogant hearts, but with humble hearts, willing to represent the gospel, willing to portray the love of Christ in whatever circumstance or opportunity you bring.
[time=3522] Thank you for this time together.
[time=3524] Be with us as we go in your son's name, we pray.
[time=3527] [AMEN]
