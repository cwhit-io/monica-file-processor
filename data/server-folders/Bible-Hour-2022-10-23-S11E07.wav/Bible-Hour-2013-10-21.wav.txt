[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] >> Hey everybody, welcome to the broadcast, again, it's great to be with you and I'm so thankful that today, just for a couple of minutes, you get to join in with me on a conversation with a good friend of mine and a great friend of Black Hawk's Pastor Dan Chitwood from Crossbridge Church, and good to see you bud.
[time=51] >> Yeah, thanks for having me.
[time=52] >> Glad to be here.
[time=53] >> Glad you're here, thankful to have you and the way this works, most of you know that at Black Hawk,
[time=60] we have a huge commitment to the local church and that commitment goes way beyond our doors.
[time=67] It goes into the doors and the ministry teams and the efforts and the kingdom endeavors of a lot of churches in this community that we kind of view as really in the same ball game, moving down the field in the same direction.
[time=84] And I'm so grateful for you guys and I'm thankful for the story of Crossbridge and all that God has done.
[time=92] We have gone to the Leadership Summit together for a number of years.
[time=96] I've watched you guys grow from inception to where you are today and really, I just wanted to take this time for our Bible Hour audience, for those who would see this on our website or on your website.
[time=111] I kind of just wanted to celebrate what I know God has done recently with you guys.
[time=115] So Dan, just real quick, let's talk for a second about real briefly where all this started for you guys back years ago.
[time=123] >> Yeah, well 11 years ago we went portable as a church.
[time=128] We were landlocked at our current, you know, our old facility and so they moved the church to the northwest side of town and went portable, setting up, tearing down.
[time=141] Every Sunday, a team rolling in at 6.30 in the morning, I think in 11 years, I think maybe we canceled church on a Sunday morning twice.
[time=150] >> Wow, that was at the YMCA.
[time=152] >> Yeah, YMCA, you know, people dig in trailers out of snow drifts and we would set everything up, stage light, sound, got to use their children's area.
[time=163] And then after service, tear it all down and do it again and over those 11 years, we're able to purchase property out on Hirsch Road in I-69 and then develop some ponds, some sports fields.
[time=178] Four years ago, I put office facilities out there, a place we said to do church six and a half days a week, Sunday mornings at the Y.
[time=185] And then most recently built an auditorium for Sunday mornings, so starting this last September 15th, just about a month ago, we got to start being a church out in our permanent home for seven days a week.
[time=199] >> That's great, that's great, so from the YMCA, the Parkview YMCA over there on DuPont for the last 11 years now out to Hirsch Road and I can't tell you what a joy it's been for me, for my family.
[time=214] I've told you this before, we live out by Hirsch Road and we go buy your property every day for a number of different reasons, usually multiple times a day, and it has always been for years, the topic of conversation, even in our car, our home.
[time=231] God continue to give them favor, God continue to give them opportunity, God continue to give them the chance to continue to build what you've started and to see you guys out there last month and to know that now
[time=244] you're there, couldn't be more excited.
[time=246] >> Yeah, we've been, it's been needed, announced into the community, we just did a mail or invitation that had pictures and then the front said, "Oh, it's a church," and that's, you know, the comment we get from people say, "When they hear who we are," they're like, "Oh, that's, you're a church, we've seen your fields, we've seen the kids out there in the sports, things on Saturdays, or during the week, we see those buildings, and it's a church."
[time=271] And so it's neat now to actually be out there meeting on Sundays and be able to invite people and actually be there.
[time=278] >> Well, and I want, I want our Bible Hour audience to hear this, especially for me.
[time=283] I, most of you in our viewing audience, you all know the spirit of Black Hawk's ministry, you know what we're about, you know what means the most to us.
[time=293] If I didn't have somewhere to go on Sunday mornings, and I do, if I didn't, I'm telling you, not only because of convenience,
[time=300] I can literally like hit a six iron to their church from where I live, but because of what they stand for,
[time=309] I know that deep in your hearts is this desire to be a place and more than a place of people
[time=316] that can connect with those far from God and invite them into life with God in a meaningful
[time=322] transformational way, and I'm so grateful whenever I see that happening in a church, that comes with a price.
[time=330] >> Yeah. >> That's hard, hard work, and to watch you guys work so hard for so many years and now to see him blessing that effort, I'm really thankful.
[time=339] So congratulations. >> I appreciate that. >> Yeah, absolutely.
[time=342] And I hope those of you in our viewing audience, we've said this to you before, if you're close to where these guys are, go see them.
[time=348] If it's of interest to you, go check it out. Hirsch Road, Crossbridge Church, right before you get to 69, if you're coming from Tonkel on Hirsch right before you get to 69,
[time=361] there it is over on the right hand side. And thanks so much for being with me today.
[time=366] >> Thanks for having us. >> Thanks for all you guys are doing, and God bless you.
[time=369] And God bless you guys for tuning in, as always. I hope you have a great week, and we hope to see you soon.
[time=375] Bye-bye.
[time=405] [MUSIC]
[time=435] [APPLAUSE]
[time=465] [MUSIC - 330 seconds]
[time=799] 96 people were crammed onto a rickety boat. Engine dead, adrift in the South China Sea.
[time=809] They could see the ominous clouds of a tropical storm headed their way.
[time=814] For four days since leaving Vietnam, these refugees had watched ships pass one, two, five,
[time=825] 25, 50 ships had passed offering no assistance. They hoped someone would pick them up and give them the safety.
[time=833] The 51st ship passed by, and then something astonishing happened. They turned around to come back.
[time=841] The captain of the ship, a South Korean gentleman, saw these people in their plate and was a fisherman for 25 years.
[time=848] This all happened in November of '85 and the man's name was Jion. Jion, a captain of a ship for 16 years, this captain.
[time=857] He was returning from the Indian Ocean with 25 sailors and 350 tons of tuna in the boat.
[time=864] It's an interesting mental picture. The boat people, as they called them, included a woman who was eight months pregnant and they were stranded.
[time=874] As the captain approached, you can see the people screaming and waving their shirts.
[time=879] And then five years later, five years ago, rather, excuse me, there was a great reception for this man and for his active kindness.
[time=886] If he hadn't stopped, 51 people, pregnant women, nursing mothers, would have perished.
[time=893] The captain of the ship lost his job for doing this against company policy, never worked as a ship captain ever again,
[time=901] and had to survive in the kindness of friends and strangers.
[time=906] It's this kind of activity, friends, that frames for us a little bit what's going on in the parable of the Good Samaritan.
[time=914] This selfless service that knows no limits, that has the good of other people in mind, even above my own good.
[time=924] I want to read with you in Luke 10. We've been in Luke 10 for several weeks. We'll be there for a couple more.
[time=928] So if you have a Bible, please go to Luke 10. We're starting in verse 25.
[time=932] What is known to us as the parable of the Good Samaritan?
[time=936] Even people that aren't in church who don't know the Bible.
[time=939] And if you're here and if you're watching online or if you're watching on the Bible hour and you don't really know the Bible very well, you probably know what it means to be a Good Samaritan.
[time=948] It's come down to us in our language over the years.
[time=951] And so I want to read you the story around this and then maybe work our way back through it and talk about what it means,
[time=957] what is the cost of kindness for us?
[time=960] The cost of kindness for the South Korean fishing boat captain was his job, was his whole livelihood, his whole identity.
[time=970] Starting in Mark, excuse me, in Luke 10 and verse 25, "Behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying,
[time=983] "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" Jesus said to him, "What's written in the law? How do you read it?" He answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself."
[time=1001] He said to him, "You have answered correctly. Do this," Jesus said, "and you will live."
[time=1007] But the lawyer, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"
[time=1014] Jesus replied, "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead."
[time=1026] Now by chance the priest was going down that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
[time=1033] So likewise, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
[time=1040] But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion.
[time=1049] He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine.
[time=1054] Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.
[time=1058] And the next day he took out two denari and gave him to the innkeeper, saying, "Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back."
[time=1069] Which of these Jesus said, "Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?"
[time=1075] The lawyer said, "The one who showed him mercy." And Jesus said to him, "You go and do." Likewise, I would love to pray with you again if I could.
[time=1085] God, thank you for the many people who have prayed for us this week and who are praying, and who have faithfully served in this Church God for longer than I've been alive.
[time=1095] We are grateful.
[time=1097] We stand on their shoulders, and we are so thankful to be a part of the Church at Black Ock made up of all manner of generations of people.
[time=1106] I pray, God, that you would go before us this morning and open our hearts, our ears, our eyes
[time=1113] to behold wonderful things from your law.
[time=1115] God, make me invisible.
[time=1117] May you increase.
[time=1119] May I decrease.
[time=1121] May you add your blessing to the teaching and the hearing and the reading of your Word.
[time=1125] I pray all of these things in Jesus' name with great thanksgiving.
[time=1129] [AMEN] There is an outline in your bulletin if you'd like to follow along with it.
[time=1134] Just some things by way of review as we get started this morning.
[time=1139] This whole conversation, this whole story gets off to a very bad start.
[time=1145] When it says the lawyer is going to put him to the test, this is a person that wants to win.
[time=1151] And they don't really care about the other person so much, they care about winning.
[time=1155] I'm going to win, I'm going to stump you, watch this.
[time=1159] I guess you could say he's one of those guys that does this.
[time=1163] He wants to win.
[time=1165] Proverbs 3.30 comes to mind.
[time=1167] And I'll come back around this in just a minute.
[time=1169] Do not, it says in Proverbs 3 verse 30, do not contend with a man for no reason.
[time=1175] When he is done, you know harm.
[time=1177] Don't go looking for a fight, but the lawyer just blows to the stop sign.
[time=1181] He goes looking for a fight, he's picking a fight.
[time=1183] So we're off to indeed, as Kelly said in recent days, a bad start.
[time=1187] He is indeed, everything else happens in the story.
[time=1191] He's going to go in a wrong direction because of the bad start that he's off to.
[time=1194] To put him to the test, to try to win.
[time=1198] Proverbs 20 verse 3 says this, this will be a good verse to commit to memory.
[time=1202] Proverbs 20 and verse 3.
[time=1204] It's an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife.
[time=1207] To see there's strife, I'm going to keep my distance.
[time=1210] But every fool will be quarreling.
[time=1213] Don't look, it's hard enough, friends.
[time=1216] It's hard enough to navigate the waters of this life without going to look for fights everywhere.
[time=1222] So don't be that kind of a person is my encouragement to you from Luke chapter 10.
[time=1227] This person is not a lawyer in the 21st century since.
[time=1230] He's not an attorney.
[time=1232] He is a law teacher.
[time=1233] He is somebody who was an expert in teaching what we would call the Old Testament.
[time=1238] The first 39 books of the Bible said he would know that, especially the first five.
[time=1243] So that was his job.
[time=1244] That's what he did.
[time=1245] So he would have known Proverbs 3 and just kind of blew right past it.
[time=1250] Like he didn't even care.
[time=1251] Sad, really.
[time=1253] When we know better, and many of us do.
[time=1256] When we know better and we ignore warning signs, that's no good.
[time=1260] Like the Detroit Tigers and the Boston Red Sox just run right through the third base coaches.
[time=1264] Stop sign.
[time=1266] Sorry, I'm still smarting a little bit from that.
[time=1268] Don't do that.
[time=1271] When the coach says stop, don't run right through the sign.
[time=1275] That's free, bonus coverage, you're welcome.
[time=1277] Okay, second thing in the notes is this, there's an answer.
[time=1281] There's an answer to the question Jesus, the question that's asked, love the Lord your God with
[time=1287] all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, with all your strength.
[time=1290] Love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=1294] This is the response.
[time=1296] This is the answer to the question.
[time=1299] What shall I do to inherit eternal life?
[time=1301] Look at the story with me again.
[time=1304] What shall I do, verse 26, Jesus answers the question with a question.
[time=1309] That's a good model, by the way, for somebody who's after you.
[time=1313] If somebody's after you and they're just going to be corolling with you, ask them some questions.
[time=1318] It helps to disarm situation.
[time=1320] That's exactly what Jesus is doing.
[time=1321] This guy's got his guards got to come down.
[time=1324] So another way in which he's a great example to us.
[time=1327] What shall I do?
[time=1328] What does Allah say?
[time=1329] What do you how do you read it?
[time=1330] And then he gives us this answer, which is a good answer.
[time=1333] I thought about Psalm 36.
[time=1335] I think it's appropriate, friends.
[time=1337] We're going to sing more songs this morning.
[time=1339] I think it's appropriate to sing those songs with your eyes wide open.
[time=1343] What is God like?
[time=1345] People want to know the answer to that question in the world today.
[time=1348] What is God like?
[time=1349] And the answer to what God's like is found in part in Psalm 36.
[time=1352] These verses were ringing in my ears all week and I encourage you with them.
[time=1356] This is every bit as much worship as singing songs, hearing from God's word.
[time=1362] I love the Psalms and you probably do too.
[time=1364] Because the Psalms are inspired speech rising up from people to God.
[time=1370] And the prophets, it's like, "Thus does the Lord." And it kind of drops that way.
[time=1373] It's more familiar language to us.
[time=1375] But in the Psalms, it's the Psalmist.
[time=1377] And there's many of them.
[time=1378] There's David.
[time=1379] There's a man named Asaph and others who pray these prayers.
[time=1382] And as they rise up to God, the Holy Spirit intercepts them and infuses them with his spirit.
[time=1386] It's incredible.
[time=1388] So here's what God is like.
[time=1390] And I want to encourage you in light of what the man says to respond to God in this way.
[time=1396] When you're called to love somebody, you love them because you know what they're like.
[time=1401] Here's what God is like.
[time=1403] Your steadfast love, O Lord, extends to the heavens.
[time=1407] Your faithfulness to the clouds.
[time=1412] I'm going to offer you a chance after the service this morning to come down and to pray with us if you want to.
[time=1417] If you're having a struggle in your family, if you're anxious, if you're tired, if you're lonely, if you're worried.
[time=1423] And I prayed these words over people about an hour ago.
[time=1428] And it was the best use of my time.
[time=1430] It's true, friends.
[time=1431] Do you believe these words are true?
[time=1433] These will change your life.
[time=1434] Do you believe?
[time=1435] I couldn't hear you just a minute ago.
[time=1436] Okay.
[time=1437] Your righteousness is like verse 6, "The mountains of God." It's not going anywhere.
[time=1443] Your judgments are like the great deep, man and beast.
[time=1448] You save, O Lord, how precious is your steadfast love, O God.
[time=1453] The children of mankind take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
[time=1458] They feast on the abundance of your house.
[time=1462] And you give them drink from the river of your delights.
[time=1465] This is what God is like.
[time=1467] And so when we are commanded to love him, isn't like there's no strong army going.
[time=1471] You've got to love this God who doesn't really love you very much.
[time=1474] That's not the picture at all.
[time=1477] So follow me.
[time=1478] So we're commanded to love him.
[time=1480] That's how I inherit eternal life, as the man said, in the passage.
[time=1484] I'm called to love him completely and fully and love my neighbor as myself.
[time=1489] Well, what's God like?
[time=1490] He is surpassingly gracious and loving and faithful and good.
[time=1495] So I can love him in that way.
[time=1497] And therefore, if he says love my neighbor, I'll do it because he's loving.
[time=1500] Do you see the pattern?
[time=1502] I'll do whatever God says because he loves me, because he's for us.
[time=1508] Listen to that in just a minute.
[time=1509] We're going to sing that God is for us, that he is on our side.
[time=1512] And I believe that this morning.
[time=1513] I'm counting on it, in fact.
[time=1515] I hope you are too.
[time=1517] We have a clue here as well.
[time=1519] This is also in your bulletin.
[time=1520] So we have the answer and then we have a clue.
[time=1523] He says do this and you will live.
[time=1526] I wrote this down this week and I encourage you to write it down as well.
[time=1533] I think this is really, really important.
[time=1534] It's a little subtle detail in the story that we miss sometimes.
[time=1538] This is why I wrote down this week.
[time=1540] Those who love God will hear Jesus.
[time=1544] Go ahead.
[time=1545] Write that down.
[time=1546] Those who love God will hear Jesus.
[time=1550] So when he gives a command, for example, do this and you will live.
[time=1554] I don't take time to ruminate and say, huh, I wonder if I should.
[time=1560] It's a clue.
[time=1562] God reveals himself to us in Jesus.
[time=1566] Finally, definitively, ultimately.
[time=1569] Hebrews says that Jesus is the exact representation of God's nature.
[time=1574] He's like a ring that you put a stamp and a document with.
[time=1577] That's what Jesus is like.
[time=1578] Jesus is exactly what God is like.
[time=1580] He is the image of the invisible God.
[time=1583] The firstborn of all creation is how the Bible describes him.
[time=1586] This is an amazing quote by a man named John Whale.
[time=1588] It's in your digging deeper thing in your bulletins.
[time=1592] It'll also be in the screens in front of you.
[time=1594] So take it away and chew on it.
[time=1596] I've been chewing on it for a few years.
[time=1597] You just got it.
[time=1598] So I'll give you some time to chew.
[time=1600] This is an amazing picture of who Jesus is.
[time=1603] And I think it's important to lift him up and to give him his proper place.
[time=1607] It's God himself, he says, personally present and redeemingly active.
[time=1612] That he's active to save and to bring freedom every day all the time.
[time=1618] Who comes to meet men in this man of Nazareth.
[time=1622] Jesus.
[time=1623] He's more than a religious genius and more than a holy man.
[time=1627] He himself knows that he's more.
[time=1629] When you have friends and coworkers who say these things.
[time=1632] Well, he's a holy man and a good prophet and that's great.
[time=1635] That's not what Jesus thinks of himself.
[time=1637] It's important that you know that.
[time=1639] It's not loving to tell someone a lie.
[time=1641] So he doesn't leave us that option.
[time=1645] The Gospel story, Friends, is a tree rooted in the familiar soil of time and sense.
[time=1652] I can experience it, but its roots go down to the abyss and its branches fill the heavens.
[time=1659] Given to us in terms of a country in the Eastern Mediterranean, no bigger than Wales, really small 2,000 years ago, in the first century of our era.
[time=1666] Its range is universal.
[time=1668] It's on the scale of eternity.
[time=1672] It's for everybody.
[time=1673] God's presence and his very self were made manifest in the words and works of this man,
[time=1679] Jesus.
[time=1680] In short, the man Christ Jesus has the decisive place in man's ageless relationship with God.
[time=1686] And here's the punch line and this is amazing.
[time=1689] He, that is Jesus, is what God means by man.
[time=1692] He is what man means by God.
[time=1695] So I don't have the right to take what he says under advisement or as, as, uh, let's
[time=1701] interesting counsel.
[time=1702] Thank you very much.
[time=1703] What he says, I need to do it because he loves and I respond to him in love.
[time=1708] That's how I become fully alive in the first place.
[time=1711] So there's a little clue in the middle of the story that Jesus is God.
[time=1717] That when I, those that love God will listen to Jesus and if you don't, then you don't.
[time=1722] Which is itself a loving thing for me to say.
[time=1724] The test continues with this man trying to justify himself, right?
[time=1729] He's trying to limit the circle of people that he can love.
[time=1732] The circle of people that he can respond to in love in that way.
[time=1736] All the ways of a man it says are pure in his own eyes in Proverbs 16 verse 2.
[time=1742] The Lord weighs the spirit.
[time=1744] In Luke 16, Jesus is speaking of the Pharisees.
[time=1747] That's what this guy is.
[time=1748] This lawyer is a Pharisee.
[time=1749] Very likely.
[time=1750] He said you are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts.
[time=1755] For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.
[time=1759] Justifying yourself.
[time=1760] Trying to make, to clear yourself, to make yourself seem less or more than what you are.
[time=1765] Nothing down that road.
[time=1767] So here's the, the stage has now been set.
[time=1769] So let's talk about what parables are real quick by way of review.
[time=1773] You have to know your cultural setting and your audience when talking about a parable.
[time=1778] And the audience in this case is this lawyer.
[time=1780] He's the one who's asked the question.
[time=1782] He's the one who's come to confront Jesus.
[time=1784] He's the one who's the audience really.
[time=1786] I had a former student come to see me this week, graduated in 2007.
[time=1791] He's getting his PhD from the University of Washington in medical informatics.
[time=1797] Something like that.
[time=1798] Something I don't understand.
[time=1800] And he said that he is the only Christian person some people in his field of study have ever met.
[time=1807] It's incredible.
[time=1810] That's not my cultural context.
[time=1813] I rarely meet a person who doesn't at least have the pretense of some kind of faith in a God somewhere.
[time=1820] He is the first Christian person some of these people have ever even met in real life right in front of them.
[time=1826] So he has to know his audience and his cultural setting.
[time=1829] And so he reads widely things that are important to his audience because he loves them.
[time=1836] And wants to be available to them and speak intelligently to them.
[time=1840] And so should you.
[time=1844] Parables aren't allegories.
[time=1846] You know what an allegory is?
[time=1847] It's a story in which everything in the story points something else.
[time=1850] When you do that it becomes pretty exhausting in the parables because there's all this stuff going on left and right.
[time=1857] An allegory is a story in which there are these connections elsewhere everywhere you go.
[time=1861] That's not what's happening in Luke chapter 10.
[time=1864] Because it was a story told in real time.
[time=1866] And so how could I process all those things in life in other words.
[time=1870] Every parable teaches one spiritual truth.
[time=1873] It wasn't like A, B, C, D, E, F and G because it was a real live story.
[time=1878] And so it's a joke in other words.
[time=1880] This is all I explained it.
[time=1881] It's not book that Kelly mentioned how he developed for all it's worth.
[time=1884] Parables are like jokes in this way.
[time=1886] There's a place in the story where everything kind of comes down and hits home.
[time=1891] There's a punch line of a joke and you get it like ah I get it.
[time=1897] And when Jesus says that a Samaritan is the one that really acted to help him and to be a neighbor.
[time=1902] It comes crashing down the lawyer.
[time=1904] It's just like in the joke it comes crashing down on people too when you hear it.
[time=1908] Let's go back to the story itself and look work our way through it at this point.
[time=1912] Now we got a little bit of background just in case you haven't been here last couple of weeks.
[time=1916] It says that there's a man here in verse 30.
[time=1919] There's a man going down from Jerusalem.
[time=1921] It never identifies who the man is.
[time=1924] He's never ever been identified.
[time=1926] He has no name, he has no race, he has no identity just a man.
[time=1931] But he has dignity and he has value and he has meaning and he has purpose to this person who sees him the way God sees him.
[time=1942] I'll repeat myself.
[time=1944] This man has no name.
[time=1946] He has no face.
[time=1947] He has no identity.
[time=1949] He's just a man.
[time=1950] And he has meaning and dignity and value just because he's a man right there in front of Jesus.
[time=1957] He's made in God's image.
[time=1959] He has meaning and every person you meet will live forever.
[time=1963] See as Lewis says.
[time=1964] You've never met a mere mortal.
[time=1967] He's come down from Jerusalem in the day before Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.
[time=1974] He gave his speech.
[time=1975] That's what it was called.
[time=1977] Do you remember?
[time=1978] It's a great speech.
[time=1979] It's called, "I've been to the mountaintop." And so he very prophetically almost says, "If I may not get there with you, I may not arrive, but I've been to the mountaintop and it's okay.
[time=1988] I trust God in all of it." And the next day he was assassinated.
[time=1990] It's terrible.
[time=1991] Tragic.
[time=1992] Anyway, he told this story about what it, about himself coming down from Jerusalem.
[time=1997] And here's the story.
[time=1998] I won't say it like he does because he was a better orator than I am, but I'll do my very best to quote him.
[time=2003] Okay?
[time=2004] "You see," he said, "the Jericho road is a dangerous road.
[time=2008] I remember when Mrs. King and I were first in Jerusalem.
[time=2010] We rented a car and drove from Jerusalem down to Jericho.
[time=2014] As soon as we got on that road, I said to my wife, "I can see why Jesus used this as a setting for his parable.
[time=2020] It's a winding, meandering road." It's really conducive for ambushing.
[time=2028] He started at Jerusalem about 1,200 miles above sea level, and by the time we get to Jericho, you're 22 feet below sea level.
[time=2035] The dangerous place, it was called, he said, "The bloody pass." So this is the setting of the story that he's telling even himself.
[time=2045] And so I just thought about this for a minute.
[time=2047] I thought to myself, this is in your bulletin as well.
[time=2049] There's no judgment on behalf of the Good Samaritan.
[time=2053] Well, you should be walking on that road.
[time=2055] You shouldn't be doing that.
[time=2057] He just goes to help.
[time=2060] In other words, if you're wandering through a dangerous place, something bad happens to you.
[time=2065] People say, "Well, duh, don't do that." I can remember when I was talking about justice in recent days.
[time=2075] Rick Rayberg, a good friend of mine, approached me after the service and said, "You know, when you said this, it was misleading." And he was exactly right and so I'll clarify myself.
[time=2083] I was in Chicago the week before I gave that sermon on justice.
[time=2087] I think it was last summer.
[time=2088] I can't remember what it was.
[time=2090] But I mentioned in the course of my talk that I met a man who was homeless right before I talked about justice
[time=2096] and about serving those who are in need.
[time=2098] And I implied in the sermon that he was on the streets because of a bad choice he had made.
[time=2103] And what did I do?
[time=2105] I judged him.
[time=2109] I'd never met him before.
[time=2112] I'd probably never meet him again.
[time=2113] But I judged that he was there because he made a mistake.
[time=2115] And friends, I have no way of knowing that.
[time=2118] I prejudged him.
[time=2119] I have no right to do it.
[time=2121] I am not confusing.
[time=2122] Even for a moment, the hardship of walking through somebody who, over the course of many years of time, struggles of making bad choices.
[time=2130] I'm not doing that.
[time=2131] That's a hard thing.
[time=2132] It's different.
[time=2133] I'm talking about when I see somebody on the side of the road who is in need and I say, "I don't know." The good Samaritan didn't know either.
[time=2141] And there was no judgment.
[time=2142] There was, "What are you on this road for, you idiot?
[time=2144] What are you doing?
[time=2145] You shouldn't wander around.
[time=2146] But you know what's the kind of place?
[time=2147] This is the bloody road.
[time=2148] What's wrong with you?
[time=2149] Where's your protection?" We don't know what the priests in the Levi did either, but I don't doubt that they may have had some of those, I don't want to psychoanalyse fictional characters, but there they are in the story.
[time=2161] James chapter 4 says this, "Do not speak evil against one another."
[time=2171] Brothers, that's why when I hear that you're praying for us, it's so marvelously encouraging.
[time=2176] The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks evil against the law and judges the law.
[time=2183] But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.
[time=2187] There's only one law giver in judge.
[time=2189] He was able to save and destroy, but who are you to judge your neighbor?
[time=2196] This is the cost of kindness.
[time=2197] We'll get there in just a minute.
[time=2198] This is the cost of kindness.
[time=2202] God doesn't deal with us in this way.
[time=2207] Did you hear Psalm 36 about him setting up a banquet before us and these rivers of delight he gives us access to?
[time=2215] Did you hear that?
[time=2216] That's exactly what he expects from those who serve him.
[time=2219] It's the same posture for those who are in trouble, to those who are in need.
[time=2227] In Mark 1045, Jesus famously says, "Even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and give his life as a ransom for many."
[time=2235] And I know that you think this way because I do sometimes.
[time=2239] I've got to go somewhere.
[time=2242] I'm on my way somewhere.
[time=2244] Do you see in the parable?
[time=2246] Verse 33, "But a Samaritan as he journeyed," that's a little awkward in English, but it gives the clear impression that he's on it.
[time=2253] He wasn't just wandered around.
[time=2255] He was going somewhere.
[time=2256] And he was willing, watch this, he was willing to be interrupted.
[time=2261] That's what it means to have mercy, friends.
[time=2263] You can write that down if you want to.
[time=2265] He was willing to be interrupted.
[time=2272] The priest in the story, the Levite in the story, for whatever reason, they think it beneath them to act in service.
[time=2283] Who knows why?
[time=2284] We don't know why.
[time=2285] They just didn't stop to help.
[time=2289] And they were the ones that I'm sure the lawyer was like, he hears a priest like, "Yes, they'll surely stop to help."
[time=2295] Because the guy who was in the story is never identified, he's not a Samaritan, he's just a guy in need.
[time=2301] And Pharisees prided themselves on helping people who were in need.
[time=2305] And so I'm sure he's waiting for it.
[time=2307] Yeah, I'll be a neighbor to this guy, but he doesn't do it.
[time=2310] The whole story gets turned right out in the middle of it.
[time=2313] It's amazing to watch Jesus do it, actually.
[time=2318] Look at 1 Peter, chapter 2, verse 5, and this will not be in the screens, I don't think, but I thought about this when it comes to priesthood.
[time=2326] 1 Peter, chapter 2, verse 5, you can jut it down, look at it later if you'd like, but it says there, "You yourselves, like living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus."
[time=2344] So again, he is the key to all of it.
[time=2347] And we're all called to be priests, priests are on this place, priests that go, who are active.
[time=2352] We're all called to be what 2 Corinthians calls ministers of reconciliation.
[time=2356] What's that mean?
[time=2357] It means that I am the means by which other people come into relationship to the one true God.
[time=2363] I tell that story to them of here's how to be reconciled to God.
[time=2366] There's nothing more wonderful than that, friends, nothing in the world.
[time=2370] I'm so glad to be a part of it with you.
[time=2372] I don't know who your Samaritans are.
[time=2374] I thought about listing out some suggestions.
[time=2376] I won't, though.
[time=2382] Samaritans were traitors.
[time=2386] It's an ugly word, but here it is.
[time=2388] They're half-breeds.
[time=2390] For Israel that was different than it is today.
[time=2393] Half-breeds meant they were compromises.
[time=2398] So I don't know who that is for you.
[time=2402] In fact, JB Lightfoot says in one of his commentaries that it was okay to allow a Samaritan to die,
[time=2409] but not okay to allow a Samaritan to die.
[time=2410] If you saw a Samaritan in trouble and he didn't help him out and he died, that would be fine.
[time=2414] It wasn't even a sin in the mind of the people.
[time=2417] Isn't that awful?
[time=2419] And friends, I think we have those people in our lives.
[time=2422] I think we'd like to justify ourselves and say, "I will help my neighbor." Who's my neighbor? People just like me.
[time=2429] People just like me.
[time=2433] If they saw a Gentile in danger of death, they thought themselves under no obligation to save his life.
[time=2439] And Jesus explodes that whole concept in this story.
[time=2443] He gives it no room at all, none.
[time=2447] In Luke chapter 9, we read this.
[time=2449] It's before Luke 10. You're welcome.
[time=2451] Right before Luke 9 is Luke 10. Right before Luke 10 is Luke 9.
[time=2455] I misspoke. You know what I mean.
[time=2458] Luke 9 says this.
[time=2460] When his disciples, this is verse 54 of Luke 9.
[time=2464] I'll let you get there if you want. This will not be in the screens I don't think.
[time=2468] When his disciples, James and John, saw it, saw what?
[time=2472] Perhaps you're wondering. I'm glad you asked.
[time=2474] They saw that this village refused Jesus and say, "I won't, I won't listen to what you have to say."
[time=2480] When his disciples, James and John saw it, they said, "Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?"
[time=2490] Who? This is American Village. Why?
[time=2494] Nothing to do with Jesus. No thanks.
[time=2497] And how does Jesus respond?
[time=2499] He says, "No." He turned and rebuked them, said, "You guys have got it all wrong." They didn't like Samaritans.
[time=2507] Hey, should we call fire on from heaven? Should we do that?
[time=2510] They weren't like, they weren't nervous about it at all.
[time=2512] They were eager for fire to come down from heaven and destroy them.
[time=2515] Like we are eager for fire to come down from heaven on our behalf and consume those that we don't like very much.
[time=2521] Fill in the blank.
[time=2523] In John 4, that Adam was talking about earlier, it says that Jews have no dealings with the Americans.
[time=2529] No dealings. They're not in my circle.
[time=2533] In Luke 17, which is seven chapters ahead of Luke 10, there's a story of ten lepers.
[time=2538] You guys have heard the story before?
[time=2540] He's walking into a village and he meets ten lepers, which is unusual in a village, but there they are anyway.
[time=2546] And they say, "Jesus, have mercy on us." And he goes, "Go store yourself to the priest and you'll be cleansed." And they do, and they are.
[time=2556] And how many come back and give thanks to Jesus?
[time=2559] I couldn't hear you.
[time=2561] Only one.
[time=2562] Guess what he was? A Samaritan.
[time=2566] So the whole thing is just turned around on us all the time.
[time=2570] So we aren't -- God is not -- this is the second point in your -- the next point rather in your outline -- is that God is not a respecter of persons.
[time=2580] He's not a respecter of persons.
[time=2583] I am.
[time=2584] That's King James' language.
[time=2585] What does it mean?
[time=2586] It means that you're impressive.
[time=2587] I'll give you my attention.
[time=2588] You're not.
[time=2589] I won't.
[time=2590] In 1 Samuel 16, the Lord is talking to Samuel.
[time=2593] And Samuel is looking for a king to replace Saul because Saul was not cutting it.
[time=2600] He's actually looking for a king in general.
[time=2602] He sees Saul in Saul's tall, and he's broad shoulder, and he's a warrior.
[time=2606] He's handsome.
[time=2607] And God says, "Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart." You all heard that verse many, many times before.
[time=2616] It's a remarkable thing.
[time=2618] God has a very different way of evaluating people than we do.
[time=2621] In verse 33 of Luke 10, I'm back there.
[time=2624] We're all to the place.
[time=2625] Forgive me.
[time=2626] Luke 10, verse 33, it ends with these three words.
[time=2630] The Samaritan says that he had compassion.
[time=2633] I love this word compassion.
[time=2636] The word compassion in the Greek, it's a fun word to say.
[time=2639] You're welcome.
[time=2640] It's splachnidzomai.
[time=2642] Isn't that fun to say?
[time=2643] Splachnidzomai.
[time=2644] It means what it sounds like.
[time=2645] It means your bowels.
[time=2646] It means your guts.
[time=2647] It means your guts that he had compassion.
[time=2650] When we say we love you with all, I love you with all of my heart, right?
[time=2655] No, you don't love anybody with your ventricles and your aortas and your valves.
[time=2661] The ancients saw your guts, your intestines as the place where those emotions lived.
[time=2667] And I understand that, right?
[time=2669] When she walks in the room and you get those butterflies, you feel it in your bowels.
[time=2675] So you see, oftentimes people are in the Bible, guys, they're moved, right?
[time=2680] They're moved with compassion.
[time=2681] He felt compassion.
[time=2685] He didn't have a feeling.
[time=2686] He was moved.
[time=2687] Like, oh, that's too bad.
[time=2689] Sorry.
[time=2690] That's not compassion.
[time=2694] It's being moved, if you will, to action.
[time=2700] Look at these verbs.
[time=2702] This also just struck me in verse 33.
[time=2705] Are you still there?
[time=2707] Watch this.
[time=2708] The Samaritan, follow me, came to where he was.
[time=2713] When he saw him, he had compassion.
[time=2715] He went to him.
[time=2717] He bound up his wounds, poured on oil and wine, not cheap.
[time=2721] Set him on his own animal, brought him to an end, took care of him.
[time=2726] The next day, he took out two denari, that's about $300 to $400.
[time=2731] And gave him to the innkeeper, saying, take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.
[time=2740] There's no limits.
[time=2742] That's the last thing in your outline.
[time=2744] There's no judgment.
[time=2747] What's the cost of kindness?
[time=2749] No judgment?
[time=2751] No respecter of persons?
[time=2754] No limits.
[time=2757] There's like 10 verbs in there that explain what it is to have compassion.
[time=2764] Friends, I would say what it means to love your neighbor.
[time=2767] I think about 1 Corinthians 13 with newly married couples, couples that come to us for counseling.
[time=2773] I think about this all the time.
[time=2774] And if you're married in the room and you don't read these verses all the time, you should.
[time=2778] Listen, if you're not married and you want to be married someday, read these verses.
[time=2785] 1 Corinthians 13, I'm starting with verse 4.
[time=2789] Love is patient and kind.
[time=2792] Love does not envy or boast.
[time=2795] It is not arrogant or rude.
[time=2797] It doesn't insist on its own way.
[time=2800] It is not irritable or resentful.
[time=2802] It does not rejoice at wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth.
[time=2806] Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
[time=2814] Love never ends.
[time=2817] I'm not going to do it anymore.
[time=2820] I can't do it anymore.
[time=2822] Love doesn't say those kind of things.
[time=2824] Love is costly.
[time=2826] That's the picture of love that we have from Jesus, who loved us, it says, and gave himself for us.
[time=2834] This is the image.
[time=2835] This is what love is.
[time=2836] This is how we know what love is.
[time=2838] This is in 1 John.
[time=2840] First time, 4 of verse 7.
[time=2845] Love God, love your neighbor.
[time=2848] Why should I love God?
[time=2849] Because he's surpassingly wonderful in every way.
[time=2853] I should love my neighbor because God says to you.
[time=2857] But love, let us love one another.
[time=2860] Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=2861] Let's love one another.
[time=2864] Love is from God.
[time=2865] Whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.
[time=2869] Anyone who does not love does not know God because God is love.
[time=2874] In this, the love of God was made manifest.
[time=2877] That means it showed up.
[time=2879] It was revealed.
[time=2880] It was embodied among us.
[time=2883] That God sent his only son into the world that we might live through him.
[time=2888] That's what God wants.
[time=2891] He says, do this and you will live.
[time=2894] What's to live?
[time=2896] This is love, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation, the atoning sacrifice for our sins.
[time=2906] Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
[time=2912] No one's ever seen God, but if we love one another, God abides in us.
[time=2917] And his love is perfected in us.
[time=2922] I think the underlying warning in this story is this.
[time=2925] It's not what we feel.
[time=2927] It's what we do.
[time=2929] And someone wrote this this week and wrote it down.
[time=2931] We can act without love, but we can't love without acting.
[time=2937] And that's, I think, where we should land this morning.
[time=2940] What is the cost of kindness for the good Samaritan and for us?
[time=2945] It is to love without judgment.
[time=2949] It is to not be a respecter of persons, not be selected.
[time=2953] Not going to justify myself, until not have limits as the band comes up on stage.
[time=2958] We're going to sing some more songs, friends.
[time=2960] And I can't think of a more appropriate way to do that.
[time=2964] We're going to sing some old songs on Christ, the solid rock.
[time=2968] I stand as the tune from which this song comes.
[time=2972] Sing some new songs that Adam's going to work you through.
[time=2975] And I'm so grateful for that.
[time=2977] There's much to sing about.
[time=2980] I will sing of your love forever.
[time=2982] This love of Psalm 36, this faithful, generous, gracious, compassionate love that God has for us.
[time=2989] Would you all stand and let's sing together.
[time=2992] Sing of His great love for us.
[time=2995] Love that knows no limits as an example to us.
[time=3012] I will be as built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=3033] I did not trust the sweetest flame.
[time=3040] But holy trust in Jesus.
[time=3047] It's never here, my hope will go on nothing less.
[time=3052] I hope His builds on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=3064] I did not trust the sweetest flame.
[time=3071] But holy trust in Jesus.
[time=3079] Christ of cornerstone.
[time=3085] We can make strong in the city's love through the storm.
[time=3095] He is the Lord, Lord of all.
[time=3113] And darkness seems to hide His face.
[time=3119] I restore His unchanging grace.
[time=3126] And every high in stormy air.
[time=3132] My good old man.
[time=3136] Once I get out my goals, my good old within the veil.
[time=3146] Christ alone, the cornerstone we can make strong in the city's love through the storm.
[time=3162] He is the Lord, Lord of all.
[time=3184] Christ alone, the cornerstone we can make strong in the city's love through the storm.
[time=3200] He is the Lord, Lord of all.
