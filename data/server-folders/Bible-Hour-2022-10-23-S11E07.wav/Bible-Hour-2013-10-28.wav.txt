[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] >> Well hello, good and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=35] It's great to be with you and I want to tell you this morning before we go any further about a great opportunity that we have for, really each and every one of you.
[time=44] You've heard us talk over the years, actually the last ten years, about the Leadership Summit.
[time=50] This is a world class elite level opportunity for leadership training that we've had the privilege of hosting.
[time=58] And when I say world class and elite, I think sometimes that leaves some people feeling like maybe it's not for them.
[time=66] The fact is it's world class and elite because of the talent that we're able to listen to because of the level of speaker and the level of individual that this conference attracts.
[time=79] It is an amazing lineup of speakers, we do it every August, it's put on by the Willow Creek Association and it is transforming people's lives year by year.
[time=90] And I say people, everybody, I mean those who are CEOs in large corporations all the way down to moms who influence and lead their kids.
[time=99] The Leadership Summit is for everyone and anyone who wants to know better how to make an influence in a godly and effective way.
[time=107] And what we're doing beginning November 17, Sunday night, coming up November 17, is we're going to begin to, over the next several months, take a Sunday night periodically
[time=117] and show one of the Leadership Summit sessions from the previous August and invite all of you to come and be a part of it at no cost, no charge,
[time=126] to come and be a part of what we're calling Leadership Summit on demand.
[time=130] We're going to do this in November, we're going to do it in January and in April and give you a chance to come
[time=136] and take part in a learning experience that I know you'll enjoy and I believe will be very effective for you
[time=142] in the everyday leadership influence opportunities of your life.
[time=146] So come to the Black Hawk Ministries Worship Center on Sunday night November 17, you see the information right here on the bottom of the screen
[time=154] and join us, we've sent out an email to everybody who came to the summit last August, almost 900 people.
[time=161] We're saying come back and let's watch some of these sessions again and let's be reminded of what we learned back in August
[time=169] or let's pick up on some things that maybe we missed and I can't wait to see what God's going to do with it.
[time=174] We're going to enjoy seeing people who we were at the summit with and we're also inviting those who came to bring new people
[time=181] who have never been to a Leadership Summit and let them get a taste of the summit and see what it's like.
[time=187] So you come and join us, whoever you are, you're welcome to be here, no cost, no charge, just a great chance to be stimulated in your thinking
[time=195] and encouraged in your leadership heart and I can't wait to meet you, I can't wait to have you here.
[time=200] Sunday night November 17, we kick it off and it's going to be a great, great experience.
[time=205] I hope you'll come.
[time=206] Hey, I'm glad you tuned in today.
[time=207] I hope the message that you hear is one that will encourage your heart and I hope in the days to come that you'll do what we've
[time=215] invited you to do many times in the past which has come on a Sunday morning and meet this incredible Blackhawk family.
[time=221] I hope you'll take me up on it.
[time=223] Thanks so much for being part of our family and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=245] And you came to my rescue and I won't be where you are.
[time=275] My old life, I've wasted your hands, got a mercy, humbled, I bow down in your presence that you've thrown.
[time=298] And I call you and sir, and you came to my rescue and I won't be where you are.
[time=350] [MUSIC]
[time=364] All right in my life, in my life, we live ten high in our world.
[time=377] We live ten high in our love, we live ten high.
[time=391] In my life, we live ten high in our world, we live ten high in our love.
[time=406] We live ten high in our world, we live ten high in our love, we live ten high in our life.
[time=457] And I call you and sir, and you came to my rescue and I won't be where you are.
[time=510] Well hey, it's great to see all of you this morning.
[time=513] I mean that, great to see you, great to be with each and every one of you that make up this family at Blackhawk.
[time=520] As I look around the room, I see so many of you who have over the years become not only dear friends, but truly like family to me.
[time=529] And to my family, I'm grateful for the years that God has given me here thankful for what I sense and see God doing thankful every day.
[time=539] Honestly, to get to be a part of it with you.
[time=542] And to those of you who call Blackhawk home, and even to some of you who may be new today, today, in light of what we're going to talk about, I'm really glad all of you are here.
[time=554] And if you are new, if you're visiting today, you're going to get to experience sort of a unique thing.
[time=559] We don't do it all the time, but periodically, like in any healthy family, I think it's good sometimes to have a family chat.
[time=568] It's good to have a family meeting, healthy families do that.
[time=573] Every once in a while, they get together and sit down and talk about things that are real.
[time=578] They talk about things that are important, and we want to today just take a pause from our study in Luke 10 on the Good Samaritan.
[time=587] We want to spend some time, I want to spend some time just talking with you about some things that are on my heart, on the heart of our elders and our staff.
[time=595] And we're really thankful that all of you are here.
[time=598] Allow me to say right up front, right out of the gate this morning that while I'm deeply grateful for the long list of ministry positives that are present here at Blackhawk these days, ministry blessings, those things that continue to play out daily, inside and outside these four walls.
[time=617] While I'm thankful for transformed families, and we see God doing that each and every week, we see Him working in the lives of families, young and old, changing them and growing them into the families that He wants them to be.
[time=631] While I'm grateful for changed lives, lives that we get to meet, lives that we get to know, lives that we get to walk through life with.
[time=640] While I'm thankful for multiple adoptions, as Matt and Abby shared earlier, multiple adoptions going forward in Blackhawk families these days, little ones, little orphans getting ready to become sons and daughters of many of you in this family.
[time=658] While I'm thankful for hundreds of people in small groups and grow groups and Sunday morning communities these days.
[time=665] While I'm grateful for a Christian school, Blackhawk Christian school, that is absolutely overflowing in enrollment and ministry opportunities to those kids and their families.
[time=677] While I'm thankful for one of the strongest, most closely knit ministry staffs I've ever been a part of in almost 26 years of ministry.
[time=686] While I'm grateful for the Bible hour and the broadcast that goes out every week which continues to broaden and expand and reach more and more homes and families and individuals in this region.
[time=700] While I'm thankful for a growing number of individuals, couples and families that continue to evidence a willingness to take the gospel along with their unique gifts and callings and go.
[time=713] We keep seeing people from this family leaving for the good reason of going and taking their calling and their gifts and the gospel to places across the country, places even across the world.
[time=728] I'm so thankful that that's the kind of church we are while I'm very grateful for it all.
[time=733] Also, I'm also a little sad these days.
[time=738] I'm a little sad these days.
[time=740] We've been going through a time of transition and change here at Blackhawk in one specific area of ministry in particular, our Sunday morning worship and music ministry.
[time=753] I feel in my heart like we have let some of you down. I feel like in my heart I've made some mistakes over these last six months.
[time=764] I want to just talk to you a little bit about that this morning.
[time=768] I know as I talk about worship and music and as I say to you that I feel sorry, I feel like I've made some mistakes.
[time=775] I know that there are those in the room who would say, "What are you talking about?" I absolutely love what goes on on Sunday mornings with worship and music, and I'm aware of that.
[time=787] I'm grateful that you're encouraged. I really am.
[time=789] I also know that there are others who have questions or who have struggled in recent days.
[time=795] I know that there are others in this family who might could use a little bit of input and a little bit of communication, and that's how families work.
[time=804] You may feel one way, she may feel another, but we've got to at times sit down and work it out, and so this morning I hope we can do that very thing.
[time=812] Let me start that discussion by just stating that with Corbin Miller, who we have been blessed to have as our worship pastor over these past 12 years,
[time=824] with Corbin leaving our team gradually over these past six months, we've been trying to figure out how we'll move forward in the days to come on the Sunday morning worship and music endeavor.
[time=837] In the process, we've engaged a number of different team members to accomplish this moving forward, and what's happened is that because these gifted team members who have stepped up to lead us in this arena,
[time=852] because they are different than Corbin, because they're not Corbin, because they haven't been trained like Corbin, because they don't have Corbin's background,
[time=867] because they have different talents and gift mixes than Corbin, because they're different than Corbin, what they do, how they sing, the music they prepare,
[time=878] the lighting that they program, the staging, the mix of the sound and volume, all of it, because they are different than what we've had for 12 years.
[time=888] It makes everything that they do feel very different to you and to me.
[time=896] And this is where I feel like I've let some of you down. I've been in full-time ministry for almost 26 years, and I know how personal it gets for some people on the topic of music and worship.
[time=909] You see many people, many people, they connect songs that we sing on Sunday.
[time=916] They make a connection in their hearts and minds and souls. They make connection with the songs we sing on Sunday to a number of different things.
[time=923] One thing they connect songs that we sing on Sunday to is spiritually significant seasons of time in their lives.
[time=932] I've seen it for years. People connect music and worship to times in their lives when God did great things in them, when God did great things for them.
[time=942] The songs that were being sung when you walked an aisle to receive Christ, the songs that were being played when you sang in the assembly in worship during that first stage of spiritual growth in your life.
[time=957] You see those songs and those who led those songs and the way those songs sounded and felt.
[time=962] Sometimes they take up a very large and significant place in individuals' hearts and lives. I know that.
[time=969] Sometimes people connect songs that we sing on Sunday to special people in their lives.
[time=975] Significant relationships formed over the years around that arena of music and worship.
[time=983] I don't know if you know this, but many of us have experienced this right here, this one right here in what's going on with Corbin.
[time=990] Do you know the average stent of a normal worship pastor in a church in North America?
[time=999] Do you know how long the average worship pastor stays in a church?
[time=1005] Yeses? Three. Three years. And we've had the same one for twelve. Twelve great years.
[time=1017] And in those twelve great years we have grown extremely accustomed to the way in which worship gets done.
[time=1026] That's a good thing. People even connect songs that we sing on Sunday. They connect worship in the church to their own families.
[time=1034] Oftentimes it's personal because their kids have been playing instruments with this individual.
[time=1040] Oftentimes family members who sang or led worship or served in that arena for years, it becomes very special.
[time=1047] And when you make changes, okay, when you make changes to any of that, it can be very, very difficult.
[time=1054] It can be very, very challenging for people. A little history here might help, might encourage you.
[time=1062] When Blackhawk transitioned years ago from Don Kruger, Don was the very first music pastor here at Blackhawk years and years and years ago.
[time=1072] And Don did music a certain way. There was a certain style to the way Don led and organized music and worship at Blackhawk.
[time=1081] And when Blackhawk transitioned from Don to a young man named Pete Coby, back in the 70s, early 70s, there was turmoil here at Blackhawk.
[time=1091] It was difficult because it always is with music. It always has been. It always is and it may always be.
[time=1104] It's difficult when you're dealing with songs that you sing on a Sunday. Songs that you love and enjoy.
[time=1112] And when you start dealing with who sings those songs and how those songs get sung.
[time=1117] When all of these things begin to come together, you realize you're dealing at times with emotions and personal opinions and preferences that are strong because of connections that are felt.
[time=1127] When Pete Coby left in 1994 and Scott Schindler stepped in to that position, it was a difficult transition.
[time=1135] It always is with music and worship and the preferences and the opinions that come with them.
[time=1142] Real quick, when I say it's difficult, when I say it always is with respect to music and worship in the church, I'm simply stating a fact. I want you to hear me.
[time=1152] I'm not saying that it's right.
[time=1156] I'm not saying that because it's music and worship that it's okay for people to be caustic or critical or divisive or mean-spirited.
[time=1165] I'm just saying oftentimes that's what happens.
[time=1169] Oftentimes that's how that goes for the reasons that we've stated.
[time=1174] When Scott was tragically killed in November of 2001, and when I then hired a 21-year-old who had never led worship in a church ever on a regular basis in his life, his name was Corbin Miller.
[time=1191] When I see him there on the screen, people were angry with me.
[time=1197] Things got negative really quick, and I was told by many that he would never last.
[time=1206] People said, people said he's young, he's overconfident, he thinks he knows everything, and I would say, I know.
[time=1216] He can come off that way at times. The problem is he does know, well never mind.
[time=1221] They'd say things like, why is he changing this?
[time=1226] Or why does he have to alter that? And I would say to them, I would say to them this, and I hope you'll hear this.
[time=1235] I said to people, in 2001, angry about Corbin Miller, I said to them, I said, listen, would you please be gracious and patient?
[time=1251] Would you please be gracious and patient? He will learn in time how to lead us.
[time=1261] And you will, if you're gracious and patient in this time of transition, you will in time learn how to, what, follow.
[time=1274] That's what I asked our church 12 years ago, and learn he did, and learn we did.
[time=1284] What a gift it's been. What a gift of creativity, excellence, faithfulness, and vision.
[time=1290] Corbin has brought and has meant to this family of ours. Amen? Amen.
[time=1296] Well, when Corbin and Tanya announced they were Poland bound, we made the decision to go forward with a team, with a team of gifted worship leaders, from right here on our staff and from our own church family.
[time=1311] And right here in this discussion, this morning at this point, I think it's good for me to stop and for me to explain why our elders, why our staff decided to go forward with a team of music leaders.
[time=1323] This really does touch on a very important biblical leadership principle that we find ourselves here at Blackhawk connecting with more and more and more so as the days go by.
[time=1334] And that principle would be the principle of plurality.
[time=1338] Maybe it's a word you know, maybe it's a word you don't. No big deal. The word means this as it relates to God's design for leadership in the church.
[time=1346] This phrase plurality means a group of totaling more than one.
[time=1353] A group of totaling more than one. And I want all of you to understand. I want all of you to support our approach to leadership.
[time=1361] But how can you, if I don't communicate it to you? How can you understand it if we don't say it? How can you grasp it if we don't teach it?
[time=1370] So let me just give you a quick overview here. I really think this is important as we move forward in this discussion this morning at Blackhawk.
[time=1378] We believe God's design for leadership and oversight in the local church has always been from the very beginning of the church.
[time=1386] We believe God's design for its leadership has always been elders.
[time=1391] It's what it says in the Bible. God has designed the church to be led by elders.
[time=1398] In Acts 6, deacons come into the picture to help meet some of the physical needs of the family.
[time=1403] But God's overarching design has always been a team of elders.
[time=1408] God honoring men of proven 1 Timothy 3 character who are willing to listen,
[time=1414] who are willing to collectively use their unique individual gifts as part of a divinely assembled team.
[time=1423] Collective use of individual gifts as part of a divinely assembled team.
[time=1430] In the New Testament, as the church gets birthed in the book of Acts, we see reference to and the putting in place of elders.
[time=1441] Not staff. It's not in there. Not senior pastors. It's not in there.
[time=1455] We came up with staff. We came up with, I did a wedding yesterday.
[time=1461] It was a beautiful wedding. And I got to talk about how God designed marriage.
[time=1466] We came up with weddings. Are weddings bad? No. Weddings are fine.
[time=1473] The highest purpose though in all of that is marriage.
[time=1477] And the highest purpose in God's design for leadership in the church has always been from the very beginning elders,
[time=1485] appointing elders, establishing elders. This is what Paul did. This is what Barnabas did.
[time=1490] They appointed and established elders. In Titus 1, Paul says to Titus before you leave Crete,
[time=1496] make sure that you appoint elders to oversee that church. Paul and Barnabas in Acts 14, 23, with Lyconium and Lystra and Derby in view,
[time=1506] cannot go forward until teams of elders have been put in place so that God's design for leadership can be fulfilled.
[time=1514] In James 5, it says that elders, plural, teams of men come to pray for those who are sick.
[time=1520] In Jerusalem, it was apparent in Acts 11, Acts 15, Acts 21 that the church of Jerusalem was led and overseen by a team of elders.
[time=1529] In Acts 20, Paul addresses the elders, plural, the team of elders from Ephesus on the beach before he leaves them again and again and again.
[time=1539] The reference is made to the plurality of elders, to the plurality of elders in each and every New Testament church that we see established.
[time=1549] And in fact, every New Testament usage of the word press buteros, everybody say that, press buteros, you're speaking Greek.
[time=1559] That's the word for elder. In every instance of that word being used, it's used in the plural, not the singular.
[time=1568] Simply stated, this is the only pattern for church leadership given in the New Testament.
[time=1575] Nowhere, in all of Scripture, does one find a local church led by or influenced by or ruled by the opinion of its people?
[time=1590] Nowhere. Or do you ever find anywhere in Scripture a local church being led by or influenced by or ruled by a singular autonomous man?
[time=1602] On his own, by himself. It's not there.
[time=1607] In God's design for the church, there was to be both strength and safety in numbers.
[time=1613] Teams were to protect. Elder teams were to protect and oversee the people, the doctrine, and the ministry.
[time=1621] Strength in numbers, more than one.
[time=1624] In recent years, we've tried to be more intentional here at Blackhawk in this effort to move more and more toward the benefits of God's design for plurality.
[time=1635] Leadership that's more about strength in numbers. Leadership that's more about a team than an individual. Leadership that's more about we, we than me.
[time=1647] And yes, I am still to this day considered the senior pastor, but we want to see this family.
[time=1655] I want to see this family and ministry influenced and led by those uniquely gifted to do so, above and beyond my own abilities, which are extremely limited.
[time=1667] And those of you who know me just said a quiet amen.
[time=1671] So in the spirit of plurality, one area of ministry where we've attempted to make real progress with this team approach has been with our Sunday morning teaching team.
[time=1683] We've known and I've believed for years that in the pulpit, in this setting right here on a Sunday morning, that in the pulpit, one voice, just one style, one man's perspective, one guy's lens through which all truth is seen and taught.
[time=1700] One approach, I believe for years that that approach has had some downsides. It tended to, from my perspective, at least it tended to elevate an individual, which I never liked.
[time=1714] It tended to leave other gifted communicators out of the mix, which I thought was unhealthy, not only for them, but for the family.
[time=1724] And it only one guy, one approach, one voice, it only connected with those in the room who enjoyed or learned best from that one man's style.
[time=1733] So we decided to move away from the one man, one voice all the time approach and give other gifted teachers and communicators an opportunity to use their gifts in a plurality type approach.
[time=1746] Different teaching elders, if you will, using their varied styles to equip and encourage the family of Blackhawk, and I am so grateful that we've done that.
[time=1758] I'd like to have Jesse Hannah and Josh Rang and Steve Webster join me. If they would, sometimes I assume everybody in this place knows everybody. I know you may not know these guys. You may never have met them.
[time=1771] You may have never been able to put a face and a name together. And so I've asked Jesse and Josh and Steve, if they would come to the stage, these are men that I love.
[time=1782] These are men that I enjoy working with. These are guys I've known for years. I've known Josh since Josh left Blackhawk. Josh Rang is here in the aqua.
[time=1795] It's a lovely aqua sweater. I've known Josh since he left Blackhawk Christian high school years and years ago went to college and then on to seminary at the Masters Seminary out in LA,
[time=1809] where we got connected even more so and our friendship has grown. Josh served on staff here for a number of years now.
[time=1817] Has a professional career and he's here in Fort Wayne with Paula and the girls. Josh is a part of our family. Jesse's been on staff here since 2004.
[time=1828] Initially as our student ministry's pastor, now in a capacity that I'll describe to you in just a little bit, but Jesse's been part of this family for a number of years.
[time=1836] Steve Webster came to Blackhawk Christian high school in 2003. Bible teacher, chairman of our Bible department at Blackhawk Christian high school now almost full time on the church side, still teaching a little bit at our school.
[time=1849] But these guys and myself, we work together to think about and to pray about and to plan our teaching to you as a family.
[time=1857] Every one of us gifted in some ways, all of us growing as communicators, each of us wanting to see all of you completed in your faith.
[time=1866] We mean it when we say that what is spoken in Colossians 1 is really our goal. We want to teach you the word of God.
[time=1874] We want to make the scriptures come alive to you in ways that help you move forward in your commitment to follow Christ.
[time=1880] And I'm grateful for these guys and I'm thankful that I don't sound like Josh, that Jesse doesn't sound like Steve.
[time=1886] I'm thankful that I get to come in here some Sundays and sit and be taught the word of God.
[time=1892] I'm thankful that I get to sit with my family some weeks because the elders of this church decided to do this rather than just this.
[time=1902] And so I'm grateful for the opportunity and thankful for these guys and would you thank them this morning for their efforts at teaching.
[time=1909] Thanks guys.
[time=1911] Josh, let me borrow that sweater sometime.
[time=1918] We've taken the same team approach, listen, we've taken the same team approach with our day-to-day leadership here on site with our full and part-time ministry staff.
[time=1929] It's true, I want to ask Jesse to make his way back up and I want to invite Mark Arnes if he would join me up here on stage.
[time=1936] My friends, because of our commitment to plurality, because of where our elders and staff are leading this church, we have a real commitment to this philosophy of leadership even in the day-to-day of what goes on inside these four walls on this campus.
[time=1953] Here's what I mean, on any given day here at Blackock, there are important and crucial financial decisions to be made on the budgetary and fiscal front.
[time=1963] And believe me, you don't want me or Jesse making those decisions.
[time=1968] Do I hear an amen?
[time=1970] You want Mark Arnes making those decisions.
[time=1974] You want Mark with all of his gifts and all of his experience and all of his understanding of all of that to be giving guidance to our ministry from a financial perspective.
[time=1985] And hear me, this is how important we think this is.
[time=1988] Mark reports to the elders.
[time=1992] Mark and I work together.
[time=1994] There's nothing that Mark does, nothing that I do that we don't talk about, but Mark reports to the elders.
[time=1999] He doesn't report to me.
[time=2002] Jesse, every day around this place, there are strategic ministry decisions that need to be made.
[time=2009] Decisions having to do with organization and the implementation of ministry endeavors.
[time=2015] Decisions that have to do with aligning teams with our mission and vision.
[time=2020] Decisions that have to do with working with our staff, with job descriptions and performance reviews.
[time=2025] And anybody who knows me knows I shouldn't be doing that, you can say amen quietly, but the fact is Jesse should be.
[time=2032] Because I don't know a guy on our team, I don't know anybody that's as gifted or able to work in that kind of way more effectively than him.
[time=2042] And Jesse reports to our elders.
[time=2045] And every day around here, there's shepherding.
[time=2048] Every day around here, there's leadership.
[time=2050] Every day around here, there's all kinds of decisions that need to be made on the overall ministry front.
[time=2056] And I'm happy to keep making those, and I'm happy to keep working on Sunday mornings, and I'm happy to keep doing my very best to shepherd our team.
[time=2063] And I'll do that, and I'll report to the elders.
[time=2066] But this place is being led by we.
[time=2070] And we do it gladly, and we do it joyfully, and we love working together, and I'm thankful for the unique gifts that God has given us to be able to do it in this way.
[time=2078] Amen?
[time=2079] Would you thank these guys for what they do?
[time=2081] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2088] And so this is why, so this is why.
[time=2092] Before Corbin decided to transition to Poland, even, our elders decided unanimously to move toward a team approach to leading worship.
[time=2105] Because we believed deep in our hearts that there was opportunity to widen the circle, that there was an opportunity to give others with gifts and talents and abilities.
[time=2116] A chance to exercise those gifts and talents, and because there were those in this room who would benefit from, just like with the teaching, varied styles and varied approaches.
[time=2126] And so we asked Adam Jones, and we asked Jonathan Leakety, and we asked Chris Lyles, and we asked Corbin, and I'm going to ask those guys to come on stage if they would.
[time=2137] We asked this team of individuals that you see there on the screen to begin to give themselves to leading this family on that front, to begin leading us in worship as a rotating team.
[time=2150] And that's exactly what we've started to do, different leaders, different styles, different sounds, a whole different look from Sunday to Sunday.
[time=2161] One Sunday you might get hard driving bigger bands with lots of sound and energy.
[time=2167] Other Sundays there might be a simple cello with a piano and one vocalist, or even a toned down acoustic set.
[time=2175] Some Sundays with a worship choir, and some Sundays without.
[time=2180] I'm so thankful for our choir as we've transitioned from Corbin.
[time=2185] We have made a philosophical choice. It's important for you to hear this.
[time=2191] I've had questions about it. I want to just make sure I communicate and answer this.
[time=2195] We have, for this season at least, we have chosen to try and engage our choir, and they have just done a tremendous job in really being a worship choir.
[time=2204] That leads our family, those in the room, in singing the songs that we're singing.
[time=2210] We're trying really to move way, way more toward a participatory worship environment.
[time=2217] And kind of away from an environment where at times maybe you just sit and listen to people singing to you.
[time=2223] I'm not saying nor are we that one is better than the other.
[time=2227] I'm simply trying to communicate with you. That's what we're trying to do. Engage the room and have all of us be the choir, if you will.
[time=2236] And I'm so grateful for our choir, who still they continue to lead us.
[time=2241] They continue to help us and they continue to do so with great hearts and great attitudes.
[time=2246] And recently, on the worship and music front, we've added one more team member to the mix.
[time=2252] And I want to have Janice Morese if she would come on up.
[time=2257] Janice Morese staff kind of got together. We've been chewing on this for a number of months.
[time=2262] We went and we talked with the elders about this.
[time=2266] And we've added Janice to this mix for a number of reasons.
[time=2269] Janice, some of you may know Janice recently. I don't know if all of you know Janice from days gone by.
[time=2274] You can see it on the screen there.
[time=2276] In 1986, she's down there on the very end. Her and her family have been a part of this family for a really, really long time.
[time=2283] Janice has history here. Janice has a legacy here. Janice understands when I talk about a meaningful reach back.
[time=2292] She gets it because she was here. And then you see her in high school in the mid-90s.
[time=2296] And now you see her here today. Hello there. It's good to see you.
[time=2300] And Janice has joined this team. And here's kind of why Janice has joined this team.
[time=2305] I'm going to just kind of do a visual here. Janice, if you'd come over and stand on this side, Corbin, if you'd stand right here in the middle for me.
[time=2313] The way this works is that over the years, Corbin really played two very significant roles as our worship pastor.
[time=2321] And he was the one guy. And in his role, he did kind of just imagine a line right down the middle of Corbin.
[time=2330] And over on this side of that line, Corbin was involved in behind the scenes leadership.
[time=2336] Organizing and administrating our Sunday music and worship ministry, all the team members, all the stuff that went into it.
[time=2343] He had his arms and his heart around planning and organizing and administrating behind the scenes. He did it very, very well.
[time=2350] And then on the other side of Corbin, sort of schizophrenic in a way, Corbin was a worship leader on a Sunday morning.
[time=2358] And you heard him sing, and you saw him sitting at the piano, and he led our family, you know, for years in worship.
[time=2365] And he did kind of both things. So now, what happened is, he just over here a little bit, not like off the stage, but go away.
[time=2373] Like all the way over there. There you go. Right there. Stop. Okay, good. We're not kicking you out yet.
[time=2378] So now Corbin's gone. And we've got this philosophy of ministry that we're going to try and pursue.
[time=2385] And so what we did was, guys, come over here. You three, come all, all of you come over here.
[time=2389] And what happened over in the last six months or so is it Chris and John, Jonathan, Lee, Chris, Liles, and Adam Jones.
[time=2395] They stepped in, and they began to give leadership on a Sunday, and they did a great job, and they did exactly what we asked them to do.
[time=2403] And I'm really thankful for the faithfulness that they evidenced in doing so. Would you thank them for that right now?
[time=2409] Okay, step back in a bit then. That goes good. You guys come here.
[time=2414] So now, going forward, Chris is going to continue to give production leadership and oversight to sound and some video stuff.
[time=2421] He's going to do a great job, Jonathan and Adam, and some others.
[time=2425] Under Adams, this is Adam Jones, and under Adams leadership are worship leaders, like Jonathan and others.
[time=2433] Our band, our musicians, Adam's going to give input and oversight to that endeavor on a regular basis.
[time=2440] And all that they do on the stage is going to come over here, young lady.
[time=2445] Janice is, if you asked anybody on our team, they would tell you that she's probably one of the strongest, most effective leaders that we have around here.
[time=2456] When it comes to building teams, when it comes to insight and ability to organize a spirit that connects with people, Janice is one of the best leaders we have.
[time=2465] And so what we've done is we've decided to kind of take her for a bit here and move her across the street from children's ministries.
[time=2472] She's still kind of halfway involved there, and that team is picking up that slack and they're doing a fantastic job.
[time=2478] We won't let that suffer. But now Janice is serving as the the point person on our Sunday morning worship and music ministry.
[time=2486] She not only is a good leader, she's an artist, she's a vocalist.
[time=2490] She'll sometimes even scoot over here. She'll sometimes even lead worship and she'll sometimes lead from behind the scenes.
[time=2496] That was very nice. You did that good.
[time=2499] So we're going to do this and we're grateful for what he did, thankful for what he did for so many years.
[time=2508] And now as he begins to transition all the way across the ocean, we're going to go forward with a great team of people who I'm really grateful for.
[time=2517] And would you all thank them as they find their way down.
[time=2527] We're going to go forward with teaching teams that teach differently.
[time=2534] We're going to go forward with a leadership team that leads in different ways.
[time=2540] We're going to go forward with a worship leading team that sounds and feels different.
[time=2546] And I will say this, one thing about the team approach is the way in which, think about this, the way in which it serves us and the way in which it furthers us in our leadership development around here.
[time=2558] We're going to lose these people in time because they're going to get better and better at what they do.
[time=2563] And we're going to be able to feed the church locally or globally because people had an opportunity to lead a church, to teach, to lead worship when in the old paradigm they never would have been able to.
[time=2578] Well, the worship without Corbin will look and feel and sound different.
[time=2582] It always works that way, going forward.
[time=2585] And I believe we can go forward with an increased and much needed sensitivity.
[time=2590] We need to communicate more often with you, like today, about these things.
[time=2599] We need to, as a team, we need to thoughtfully, for instance, we need to thoughtfully teach songs that are new.
[time=2607] The Bible says again and again, sing a what song, sing a new song.
[time=2614] Well, you can't sing new songs if we don't teach them to you.
[time=2619] And so we've even recently made a commitment to teach you songs that we are singing in a way that you can sing them.
[time=2626] We need to be careful with things like volume.
[time=2629] And we're working on this.
[time=2631] We're giving time and attention to this.
[time=2633] And you understand that you don't need me to stand here and tell you that's a challenge when you have a large church with a lot of people who like preference.
[time=2642] A lot of people who like prefer volume a certain way, so we're not going to make everybody happy, but hear me.
[time=2649] I am so sorry if volume has ever hurt you physically.
[time=2658] I'm really sorry.
[time=2660] We need to get your earplugs.
[time=2662] We need to sit you in the back, under the balcony.
[time=2664] We need to help you figure out ways for it not to hurt you.
[time=2667] We need to be careful with the volume, and I'm telling you this morning we will do that.
[time=2672] Janice is completely committed to doing that, and I'm going to tell you how.
[time=2677] I'm going to tell you the spirit with which she's going to do that in just a moment here.
[time=2681] But I want you to know we need to be careful with volume and lights.
[time=2684] Lights need to stay up a little longer.
[time=2686] We're learning as we listen.
[time=2688] People need help sometimes getting to their seat, so we want lights to stay up a little longer in the service.
[time=2693] And then come back on a little sooner so folks can begin to adjust and make their way out in a safe and courteous way.
[time=2701] Here's what I want you to hear us saying.
[time=2703] If you slept through all of this wake up now, hear this and you'll be good.
[time=2707] There is a clear plan that we have.
[time=2711] A very clear plan going forward from this day on.
[time=2716] And here is the clear plan.
[time=2718] Our plan, our plan as a family, working with them as they lead in this arena.
[time=2727] Our plan is to do what I asked you to do 12 years ago with a young 21-year-old who didn't know what he was doing.
[time=2735] Our plan in the days to come is to go forward with them graciously and patiently.
[time=2743] You hear me? To be gracious and to be patient with them as we go forward.
[time=2751] And their plan, I'm telling you this morning, Janice has signed off on this.
[time=2756] We're all on the same page.
[time=2758] Their plan going forward with you is to go forward with both sensitivity and courage.
[time=2765] Because they need to be sensitive.
[time=2768] They need to be careful.
[time=2770] And please hear me. They also need to go forward.
[time=2774] We need to continue to grow and change.
[time=2777] And they have the task of doing that in a way that's bold and that's sensitive, all at the same time.
[time=2784] We want to work at all the above.
[time=2788] Because our collective ability, Church, our collective ability and our readiness to worship as a family, preferences aside,
[time=2799] means a great deal to me.
[time=2800] It means a great deal to our elder team and our staff.
[time=2803] And my friends, it means even more to our God.
[time=2807] Let me read this to you.
[time=2808] John, just won't be on the screen.
[time=2810] Just listen, John, chapter 4, Jesus is with the woman at the well.
[time=2813] When the woman at the well realizes who Jesus was, did you ever notice this?
[time=2819] The very first thing she says, the very first question she wants to address, when she realizes that she's dealing with Jesus,
[time=2827] she goes right to worship wars.
[time=2831] Did you notice that?
[time=2833] John, let me read this to you. John 4, 21, John 4, 19, sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
[time=2841] Our fathers, boom, right into it.
[time=2843] Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, Mount Gerizim.
[time=2846] But you say that in Jerusalem is the right is the place where people ought to worship.
[time=2851] So immediately she goes right to the externals of worship, which is what we do.
[time=2857] And Jesus says to her, listen, Jesus says to her woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain or in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.
[time=2868] But the hour is coming and is now here when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth.
[time=2877] Jesus didn't care about externals.
[time=2880] Jesus wanted his people to focus on him and what was true and to worship him in that spirit.
[time=2889] That's a heart.
[time=2890] And I bumped into a heart like that just recently.
[time=2892] Beth, would you come up?
[time=2893] I was talking to my friend Beth Ward.
[time=2895] Beth's been a part of this church for over 30 years and she was telling me about a little bit of struggle she had had recently on this worship and music front.
[time=2906] And so I just asked Beth if she would come and just share a couple of things with us.
[time=2912] Good morning, friend.
[time=2913] It's good to see you.
[time=2915] He said to hold this right up here.
[time=2917] Right.
[time=2918] You keep it right there.
[time=2919] You're good.
[time=2920] These are my sermon notes.
[time=2922] I asked Kelly in the first service if I was the new assistant pastor, just kidding.
[time=2927] I'm not.
[time=2928] Yes, we're not transitioning that far.
[time=2930] No, no, don't worry.
[time=2931] No cards and letters, please.
[time=2933] But Beth just shared with me an experience that she had, an honest experience on this worship Sunday morning front and I just asked her if she would share it with you as a family, just to give you insight as to how God worked with her.
[time=2947] And actually, Adam's a part of this story, so I'm glad he's up here.
[time=2951] So Beth, tell them what you, tell them what you stumbled across.
[time=2954] I want to start out first with Proverbs 4.23 because it says, "Above all else, guard your heart for it is the wellspring of life."
[time=2963] And one Sunday morning I was sitting back there and didn't know any of the songs.
[time=2968] None of them made any sense.
[time=2969] I couldn't sing them.
[time=2971] And I was getting cranky or by the minute.
[time=2974] Now trust me, cranky comes easy for me.
[time=2976] So that wasn't any big deal.
[time=2978] But anyway, I'm back there fussing away.
[time=2981] And when the song was finished, Adam apparently, and I said in the early service, I didn't know who it was because they all looked the same to me up here.
[time=2990] But anyway, he started to pray and he prayed from his heart and it touched my heart.
[time=3000] It really did and reminded me that God reminded us that man look on the outward appearance, but God looks on the heart.
[time=3009] And I saw this young man's heart and it really changed my attitude.
[time=3014] And so now, when I don't know the song, instead of getting all fussy and cranky, I say it to God quietly.
[time=3024] And I've even turned on the radio in my car and I'm starting to learn some of these songs and the music's coming.
[time=3031] And you know, I'm even getting to like some of them, you'd be surprised to know.
[time=3036] And so if God can work on a cranky old heart like mine, then he probably can too.
[time=3042] And I just love hearing people pray and I read John 17 regularly because Jesus was praying.
[time=3050] And down at the end, in verse 23, he said, "May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me enough,
[time=3060] and have loved them, even as you have loved me." So I learned from that that unity is more important to God than my preference in music.
[time=3070] Bottom line, it's all about him, not me.
[time=3074] [AMEN] Thank you very much.
[time=3083] So just an encouragement to you, would you stand? Don't anybody leave. We've got a little bit more to go here.
[time=3089] But if you just stand and hear Beth's words and just be reminded this morning that our division and our attitude that can come from all this stuff,
[time=3101] the divisiveness, the factions that can begin, it just doesn't accomplish anything.
[time=3107] It just destroys ministry. It just widens this gap that at the end of the day hurts our efforts.
[time=3116] And so I'm so grateful for Beth and her call to you and to me to stand as a church united as we continue to work down this road together.
[time=3125] Let's worship this morning. In response, let's worship our God in spirit and in truth.
[time=3137] It is thy faithfulness. Oh, God, my Father, there is no shadow of turning with thee.
[time=3161] Now change is not like compassion. They fail now.
[time=3170] As thou has been, now forever will be.
[time=3179] Greatness thy faithfulness.
[time=3189] Morning by morning, new mercies I see.
[time=3198] All I have need in thy head hath provided.
[time=3208] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord unto you.
[time=3220] Pardon for sin and a peace that end o'er end.
[time=3229] Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide.
[time=3239] Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow.
[time=3248] Blessings all mine with ten thousand feet inside.
[time=3258] Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=3263] Great is thy faithfulness. Morning by morning, new mercies I see.
[time=3277] All I have need in thy head hath provided.
[time=3286] Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=3297] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord unto me.
[time=3312] In peace like a river attended my way.
[time=3324] When souls like sea billows roll.
[time=3336] Forever my life thou has taught me to sing.
[time=3347] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=3385] My sin of the bliss of this glorious thought.
[time=3397] My sin not imparts but the whole.
[time=3410] It is nailed to the cross and I bury no more.
[time=3421] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh my soul.
[time=3434] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=3459] And Lord is the day when my faith shall be sent.
[time=3471] The cloudy roll back as a stroll.
[time=3484] The drum shall re-down and the Lord shall descend.
[time=3495] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=3564] You
