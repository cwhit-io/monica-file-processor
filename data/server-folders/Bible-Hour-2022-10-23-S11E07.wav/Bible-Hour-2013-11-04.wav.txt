[time=747] and Savior and sacrificed all that you've done to serve and help us, and so we just
[time=755] thank you very much.
[time=757] So Luke 10 this morning, the great Samaritan as again, we conclude our series, if you
[time=764] have your Bibles in Luke 10, we're going to read through it one more time, and then we'll take a look at what God has for us this morning.
[time=773] Starting in verse 25, it says this, "And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him, Jesus
[time=781] to the test, saying, 'Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?' Jesus said to him, 'What is written in the law?
[time=789] How do you read it?' He answered, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.' And Jesus said to him, 'You have answered correctly, do this, and you will live.'
[time=807] But he, the lawyer, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, 'And who is my neighbor?'
[time=815] Jesus replied, 'A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers who
[time=821] stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead.'
[time=828] Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
[time=834] So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place, it saw him pass by on the other side.
[time=839] But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where the man was, and when he saw him, he had compassion.
[time=846] He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine, then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.
[time=854] And the next day, he took out to Daeneri and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, 'Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.'
[time=865] Jesus said, 'Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?' The lawyer said, 'The one who showed him mercy, and Jesus said to him, 'You go and do likewise.'
[time=880] Let's pray.
[time=882] Father, thank you for another opportunity again, with great freedom, and without fear, we get
[time=891] to gather together, and we get to hear from you.
[time=897] And Lord, we desperately need to hear from you.
[time=899] Again, only you have words of eternal life.
[time=904] And so this morning, God, I just ask that you would, through the power of your Spirit,
[time=910] just open our hearts and our minds to what you would have for us.
[time=914] Lord, would you, in your kindness and in your mercy, speak to us and lead us and open our
[time=923] eyes that we might see wonderful things, truths from your law?
[time=927] Or would you help me speak clearly to speak your words, to not be out in front, but to
[time=935] be behind?
[time=937] May you increase Jesus, and may I decrease.
[time=941] Pray this in Christ's name, amen.
[time=945] Well as we conclude our series of Luke 10, we're going to take two points this morning.
[time=952] We're first going to look at the big picture of the passage, and so just Kelly and Steve have done a great job of looking at all of the details, and we're just going to this morning take a step back and try to look at it in a big picture type of view.
[time=966] So we'll look at the big picture of the passage, first of all.
[time=970] And then secondly, we'll look at the clear trajectory of the parable.
[time=975] So the big picture of the passage, and then secondly, the clear trajectory of the parable
[time=981] that Jesus speaks about.
[time=983] So first, the big picture of the passage.
[time=986] And in order for us to understand this big picture, I think we need to dive into the two questions that the lawyer asks, and then watch how Jesus responds to these two questions.
[time=1000] Those two questions are found in our passage.
[time=1002] The first one is, what must I do to inherit eternal life?
[time=1006] That's in verse 25, that's the first question that the lawyer asks.
[time=1010] And then a second question, a follow-up question in verse 28, who is my brother?
[time=1017] And so we're going to dive into those questions and then pay special attention to how Jesus responds to that, to help us understand just the big picture of this passage.
[time=1028] So his first question comes in verse 25.
[time=1032] You can see it there, says this, and behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" There's a parallel passage in Mark 10, although it's a different individual.
[time=1046] It's called the rich young ruler there, but there he asks a similar question.
[time=1050] What must I do to inherit eternal life?
[time=1052] It's a very great question, probably a question that all of us need to ask.
[time=1058] And so the passage tells us right away we look at the motive of this question, the motive of the lawyer.
[time=1064] The passage tells us that this lawyer was trying to put Jesus to the test by asking him this question.
[time=1071] And so Jesus, being able to look into the man's heart and knowing his heart, kind of turns
[time=1077] it back on him and just asks him a question and respond, how do you read it?
[time=1081] I mean, what's your perspective on what the law says?
[time=1086] And so the lawyer answers as any other good Jew would answer that type of question by
[time=1092] quoting what was commonly known as a summary statement to the entire law and prophets.
[time=1102] So these two commandments that he quotes, what Jesus calls the greatest commandment, the first commandment, and the second commandment that you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=1112] Everyone would have known that that is a summary statement for the entire law.
[time=1118] Jesus said it this way in Matthew 22, he says this to the Sadducees and the Pharisees, the lawyer asked him in this passage, teacher which is the greatest commandment in the law,
[time=1129] Jesus said, you shall love your Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.
[time=1134] He says this is the great and first commandment, a second is like it, you shall love your neighbor
[time=1140] as yourself.
[time=1141] And verse 40 of chapter 22, he says on these two commandments depend all the law and the
[time=1149] prophets.
[time=1151] And so even from Jesus's perspective, this answer by the lawyer is basically coming back
[time=1159] to say this, that the lawyer's answer can be summed up in this way, eternal life comes from keeping the entire law, from living a life that is good or even good enough to
[time=1173] adhere to what God has prescribed in the law and the prophets.
[time=1178] And notice Jesus' response, it's fascinating.
[time=1183] Jesus says this in verse 28, he said to him, you have answered correctly, do this and you
[time=1193] will live, do this and you will have eternal life.
[time=1198] Notice Jesus doesn't say right away, you know what, you're off.
[time=1202] You just need to believe in me and believe in what I've done and that's what leads to
[time=1209] eternal life.
[time=1210] No?
[time=1211] What he says is this, what he says, if you do this, you will live and so Jesus is taking this lawyer on a cognitive, on a mental journey, I believe, which will ultimately end in him
[time=1224] coming back to the fact that it's only Jesus.
[time=1228] But Jesus follows this lawyer's line of thinking and according to God, one acceptable option
[time=1235] for salvation is complete adherence indeed and thought to the law of God.
[time=1242] And so Jesus' response in following this lawyer's line of thinking in essence is this, Jesus
[time=1248] is saying if you want to rest upon your efforts in order to be right with God, then you must
[time=1256] know that God demands a stellar performance.
[time=1262] If you're going to go this route, God demands a perfect life, a life that lines up with
[time=1269] what he prescribes completely and utterly.
[time=1275] So the lawyer moves on and I believe his initial question he was feeling like he had
[time=1281] kept the law, kind of like the rich young ruler had said, he said, I've done all these
[time=1287] things from my youth, if you remember that passage, I believe the lawyer's feeling that same way, but the lawyer now is starting to second guess himself I think.
[time=1296] And so the lawyer wants to test and make sure that he's on the right track, which leads
[time=1303] to his second question in verse 29.
[time=1306] But he, the lawyer, desiring to justify himself said to Jesus, his second question, who is
[time=1313] my neighbor?
[time=1316] You see, the motive of this question is, as I think clear, the lawyer wanted to justify himself, that word justify means to declare righteous, to have it be said upon you or
[time=1327] toward you that you're good, that you're in, that you've lived in a way that is acceptable
[time=1336] to God.
[time=1338] And so the lawyer was wanting to declare himself righteous.
[time=1343] The lawyer was wanting to know and feel like he was doing enough.
[time=1349] He wanted to feel like or know that God was pleased with him and pleased with his own
[time=1357] efforts to be good.
[time=1361] You see, when our lives are focused upon the law, when they're focused upon our performance,
[time=1370] we desperately want to narrow it down into manageable pieces, don't we?
[time=1376] We want to just detail it out so that we can feel good about ourselves when we're able
[time=1382] to comply.
[time=1384] When our lives are focused upon the law and dependent upon our own performance, we want as much detail as possible.
[time=1392] We want to know exactly what we need to do, exactly what is required of us, because we have to make all the right decisions.
[time=1400] We have to push all the right buttons.
[time=1404] You see, if you're anything like me, we want to draw lines.
[time=1409] Just tell me what I need to do, right?
[time=1411] So I was thinking about this message, I thought of several examples.
[time=1416] The first example is just pretty clear.
[time=1419] And I'm sure you can relate to it if you're a parent.
[time=1422] But on Saturdays, we've instituted in our family kind of a work morning.
[time=1427] So we've decided, hey, let's get our chores done on Saturday morning and let's work until
[time=1433] one o'clock or two o'clock in the afternoon, and then the rest of the day Saturday and the rest of Sunday, it's all just fun and enjoying one another and having a great time together as a family.
[time=1444] So one of the chores that comes for my kids is cleaning their room.
[time=1450] And so when I say to them, hey, kids, it's time to start cleaning your room.
[time=1454] Guess what they want to know?
[time=1457] What does that mean?
[time=1460] I'm clean for me, Daddy.
[time=1463] Does that mean under the bed?
[time=1466] Does that mean all everything has to be cleaned?
[time=1469] And so there is this concept that they want me to spell it out for them, right?
[time=1475] I mean, just this broad stroke of, hey, girls, clean your room isn't going to cut it for them, because they want to obey and they want to get it done, but they also want to move on to something else.
[time=1486] And so they need to know exactly what I'm talking about.
[time=1489] And so we go through, yes, it's under your bed.
[time=1491] There are two things that can be under your bed, anything else shouldn't be there.
[time=1495] We go on to this list of things that they know they need to do, right?
[time=1500] Same thing with the Pharisees back in Jesus' day.
[time=1505] The Pharisees went above and beyond creating different rules and expectations that went
[time=1512] beyond the law of God because they wanted to detail it out so much that they could know
[time=1519] that they were in compliance with God's law.
[time=1526] We like to detail it out, right?
[time=1528] We want to draw specific lines and yet God paints with broad strokes.
[time=1536] This is exactly what the lawyer wanted.
[time=1539] He felt like he was doing it all.
[time=1541] He felt like he was doing enough, but as the conversation continued in the back of his
[time=1547] mind, I believe the question started to bubble.
[time=1551] Am I missing something?
[time=1553] Am I doing enough?
[time=1556] Is there something else that I didn't know about that I should be doing?
[time=1562] And so thus the question comes out, okay, if I'm supposed to love my neighbor, I better
[time=1568] know who my neighbor is.
[time=1570] Would you give me some more details?
[time=1574] That's what the lawyer is saying.
[time=1576] So Jesus' response comes in verses 30 and following with the parable of the Samaritan.
[time=1586] But I believe that Jesus knowing the lawyer's heart and understanding how his mind was thinking gave an answer which would literally blow this lawyer's mind.
[time=1595] An answer that would just be too much, an answer that would be too high.
[time=1602] And that's exactly what he does with the parable of the good Samaritan, an answer which would undoubtedly leave this lawyer thinking, "Oh Jesus, you've gone too far.
[time=1613] I can't do all of that.
[time=1616] I can't, I can't do what you're calling me to do.
[time=1620] I can't be like this guy.
[time=1622] That's more than I bargained for Jesus.
[time=1625] That's going too far." So I believe one of the purposes in Jesus' response in this parable is this.
[time=1632] You see, the lawyer thought that he was basically good, that he had done all that was required
[time=1638] of him according to the law.
[time=1641] So one of the purposes of Jesus' response is to show the lawyer that he cannot do what
[time=1648] the law requires of him.
[time=1653] One of the purposes was for the lawyer to think that the bar is too high.
[time=1657] In other words, the bar gets raised by Jesus beyond his reach.
[time=1662] In order to accomplish what this lawyer wants to accomplish, Jesus is saying, "Listen, it's outside of your capability.
[time=1670] You can't be good enough." It's like a high jumper, having a bar raised, they're doing well and they've trained their
[time=1683] body over and over again and they've disciplined themselves and they've practiced and so they can jump.
[time=1689] I don't know, what is it?
[time=1690] Eight feet, nine feet on a high bar and Jesus is saying, "No, we need to raise it to a hundred feet." Just blows this lawyer's mind, "I can't do that." It's similar to what Jesus does in Matthew chapter 5 and if you have your Bible or if
[time=1708] you're on some sort of technical device, which I'm way behind, but if you have that
[time=1714] turn to Matthew 5, in Matthew 5 he's talking to a large audience, it's the Beatitudes and
[time=1721] he's talking to them and he says this in verse 20, "For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." And so the common person there is thinking, "Well, I can't be as righteous as a scribe or a Pharisee.
[time=1737] How is that possible?" And Jesus keeps raising the bar.
[time=1741] He says in verses 21, "You've heard that it was said that you shouldn't murder somebody, but I tell you, anyone who has anger in your heart is the same thing."
[time=1752] He goes on in verses 27 to follow and he says, "You've heard it said that you shouldn't commit adultery, but I tell you that even any lust in your heart is equivalent." In verse 38 and following, he says, "You've heard that it was said an eye for an eye and
[time=1768] a tooth for a tooth, but I say don't resist the one who is evil, but if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to give him the other also." And in verse 43 he says, "You've heard that it was said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy, but I say to you, love your enemy." You see what he's doing there?
[time=1789] He just keeps raising the bar.
[time=1792] And then finally at the end of that chapter in verse 48 he says, "Be perfect as your heavenly
[time=1798] father is perfect."
[time=1805] Another purpose of the parable is to help the lawyer see his great need and to see that his only hope is Christ, the only one who has kept the law perfectly.
[time=1815] You see, I believe that the law was strategically placed by God to show us that we could never
[time=1821] keep it and to point us to our only hope of Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=1826] Listen to what it says in Galatians chapter 3, starting in verse 22, it says this, "But
[time=1832] the Scriptures has confined all people under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ
[time=1840] might be given to those who believe, but before faith came we were kept under guard
[time=1847] by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed." And listen to what it says in verse 24, "Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ.
[time=1860] The law was there to show us you can't do it, but there's someone who can and did.
[time=1867] And it points us to Jesus." So the big picture of the passage by looking at the lawyers' two questions and by noticing
[time=1879] and examining how Jesus responds to these questions, by using the close context of our
[time=1888] passage in Luke 10 and seeing what the Bible actually says and then backing it up to a nearer context of another gospel in Mark 10 that we went to, backing it up even farther as we think about how to study our Bible, backing it up even a farther context of the New Testament.
[time=1902] When we looked at Galatians 3 and Matthew 5 and then the widest context, when we look at the storyline of the entire Bible, I believe we can confidently draw three summary
[time=1913] statements which help us clearly see the big picture of this passage.
[time=1920] The big picture of this passage is to number one, highlight the impossibility of justifying
[time=1926] oneself.
[time=1928] The big picture of this passage number two is to help every individual see his or her desperate and helpless position apart from Christ.
[time=1940] The big picture of the passage number three is to point every person to Christ.
[time=1947] The world's only hope for our biggest problem which is our sin and rebellion against our Creator.
[time=1953] It's the big picture of this passage as we step back.
[time=1959] This then leads to our second point.
[time=1962] We understand the big picture.
[time=1964] Now let's look at the trajectory of the parable and you may be saying, Josh, what in the world are you talking about?
[time=1970] What in the world is a trajectory of a parable?
[time=1975] So what I want to understand again is this idea of hermeneutics, hermeneutics is just a big word that says how do we understand the Bible?
[time=1981] Kelly and Steve have talked about this and we understand that there's not necessarily typology here and I'm not going to go into that and if you don't understand it, that's okay.
[time=1990] It's not an analogy but I do believe that there is a trajectory of this parable.
[time=1995] In other words, this parable is heading somewhere, it's leading us to a ultimate fulfillment.
[time=2006] And so as we open up the scriptures, we need to be careful how we interpret them.
[time=2012] And so one of the things I want to do which I've never done before and I'm going to ask for you to focus is I want to play a clip.
[time=2017] It's going to be an audio clip and it's going to be on the screens and I apologize the bulb actually went out on our big screen.
[time=2026] So I'm just going to ask you to focus and look on here.
[time=2028] But it's an audio sermon that was delivered by a guy named Tim Keller in 2007.
[time=2034] He did it at what's called the Gospel Coalition Conference, the Inaugural Conference.
[time=2039] And the title of the sermon is called the Gospel Centered Ministry.
[time=2044] But I want you to understand because I believe this is true of how we approach the Bible with a lens of how it's ultimate fulfillment is something else.
[time=2053] And so the idea that really in our passage today that it's pointing to or heading us to the fact that Jesus is the true and better Samaritan.
[time=2062] So focus on this and do your best to get it.
[time=2066] For example, that's why he says you do have to be careful.
[time=2069] Hermeneutics is important.
[time=2071] You can't just find Jesus in every little twig.
[time=2076] And there needs to be a way in which you are following the trajectory of the text no matter what that text is to Jesus.
[time=2083] You have to show how Jesus is the ultimate fulfillment of that particular trajectory of the text.
[time=2089] You've got to be responsible and yet it's as Sinclair says it's more like an instinct.
[time=2096] It's not so much just right hermeneutical principles.
[time=2100] It's an instinct.
[time=2101] Do you believe the Bible is basically about you or basically about him?
[time=2105] Is David and Goliath basically about you and how you can be like David and Goliath or basically about him, the one who really took on the only giants that can really kill us?
[time=2114] And so his victory's imputed to us.
[time=2115] Who's it really about?
[time=2117] That's the fundamental question.
[time=2119] And when that happens then you start to read the Bible new.
[time=2122] Jesus is the true and better Adam who passed the test in the garden, his garden, a much
[time=2128] tougher garden, and whose obedience has imputed to us.
[time=2132] Jesus is the true and better able, who though innocently slain has blood that cries out not
[time=2139] for our condemnation but for our quittle.
[time=2142] Jesus is the true and better Abraham who answered the call of God to leave all the comfortable and familiar and go into the void not knowing whether he went.
[time=2151] Jesus is the true and better Isaac who was not just offered up by his father on the mount but was truly sacrificed for us all while God said to Abraham, now I know you love me
[time=2160] because you did not withhold your son, your only son whom you love from me.
[time=2164] Now we at the foot of the cross can say to God, now we know that you love me because you did not withhold your son, your only son whom you love from me.
[time=2174] Jesus is the true and better Jacob who wrestled and took the blow of justice we deserve so we like Jacob only received the wounds of grace that wake us up and discipline us.
[time=2182] Jesus is the true and better Joseph who is at the right hand of the king and forgives those who betrayed and sold him and uses his power to save them.
[time=2190] Jesus is the true and better Moses who stands in the gap between the people in the Lord and who mediates the new covenant.
[time=2195] Jesus is the true and better rock of Moses who struck with the rod of God's justice now gives us water in the desert.
[time=2201] Jesus is the true and better Job.
[time=2204] He is a truly innocent sufferer who then intercedes for and saves his stupid friends.
[time=2211] Is that a type?
[time=2212] See that is not typologist and instinct.
[time=2214] Jesus is the true and better David whose victory becomes his people's victory though they never lifted a stone to accomplish it themselves.
[time=2220] Jesus is the true and better Esther who didn't just risk losing an earthly palace but lost the ultimate heavenly one who didn't just risk his life but gave his life.
[time=2229] Who didn't just say if I perish I perish is when I perish I'll perish for them to save my people.
[time=2235] Jesus is the true and better Jonah who was cast out into the storm so we could be brought in.
[time=2239] He's the real Passover lamb.
[time=2241] Jesus is the true temple the true prophet the true priest the true king the true sacrifice the true lamb the true light the true bread the Bible is not about you.
[time=2252] So there's a trajectory of Scripture that has its ultimate fulfillment in who Jesus is and what he's done and ultimately what God has accomplished for us.
[time=2262] And so the clear trajectory of this parable this morning is that Jesus is the true and
[time=2268] better Samaritan.
[time=2269] Heading that direction you can't miss it and so for in order for us to see this trajectory
[time=2276] let's answer two questions about this number one how are we like the man and secondly how
[time=2282] is Jesus like the Samaritan.
[time=2285] Look at what it says in verse 30 of Luke chapter 10 Jesus replied a man was going down from
[time=2294] Jerusalem to Jericho and he fell among robbers who stripped the man and beat him and departed
[time=2301] leaving the man half dead.
[time=2305] You see you are I am every single human is in a spiritual sense like the man who has
[time=2314] been beaten and bruised and left for dead.
[time=2320] John 10 10 it says the thief comes only to steal and to destroy.
[time=2329] This world is just after us Satan is after us to beat us down to tell us lies to leave
[time=2337] us in our condition and believing the lies of this world and our condition is helpless
[time=2345] just like the man at the side of the road listen to what it says in Ephesians chapter two it says and you you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked following
[time=2361] the course of this world following the prince of the power of the air the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh carrying out the desires of the body and the mind and we're by nature children of wrath like the rest of mankind you and I apart from Christ are dead we're not just
[time=2383] half dead we're spiritually dead unable to change our situation unless someone breaks
[time=2392] in first Corinthians two says this the natural person the person that doesn't have the spirit
[time=2399] of Christ the natural person does not accept the things of the spirit of God for their folly to him and he's not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned
[time=2412] we can't even respond to God without the spirit coming and enlightening our eyes and helping us understand the truth the truth of our helpless condition and the truth of his power to save
[time=2425] you see the human condition your condition my condition before Christ can only be described
[time=2432] as hopeless helpless lonely dark and destined for wrath that's how we're like the man we're
[time=2443] no different that lawyer is no different and Jesus is wanting him desperately to relate to that man how is Jesus like the Samaritan look at what it says in verses 33 through
[time=2456] 35 but a Samaritan as he journeyed came to where he was and when he saw him he had compassion
[time=2462] he went to him and bound up his wounds pouring on oil and wine then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him and the next day took out to denarian gave them to the innkeeper saying take care of him and whatever more you spend I will repay you when I come back how is Jesus like the Samaritan well first of all and we don't
[time=2484] have time to go here much but Jesus was maligned and misunderstood just like a Samaritan Samaritan
[time=2493] a half Jew right kind of an underclassed person Isaiah 53 describes Jesus in that same way
[time=2503] he grew up before him like a young plant like a root out of dry ground he had no form or majesty that we should look at him and no beauty that we should desire him he Jesus was despised and rejected by men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief he was fully God fully
[time=2523] man fully misunderstood but more than that his grace and I just want to read two passages this
[time=2532] morning to remind you of the grace of God through the person and work of Christ Titus chapter three
[time=2538] says this for we ourselves were once foolish disobedient let astray slaves to various passions
[time=2546] and pleasures passing our days in malice and envy hated by others and hating one another but when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared he saved us not because of
[time=2561] work done in us by righteousness but according to his own mercy by the washing of regeneration
[time=2567] and the renewal of the Holy Spirit whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior
[time=2574] Philippians two have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus
[time=2580] who though he was in the form of God did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped
[time=2586] but he emptied himself taking the form of a servant being born in the likeness of men
[time=2593] and being found in human form he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death
[time=2602] even death on a cross you see Jesus is the true and better Samaritan who didn't come to where we were
[time=2612] by just crossing the street but came to where we were by leaving heaven he's the true and better
[time=2618] Samaritan who didn't just give to denary but ultimately gave himself he's the true and better Samaritan who bore the wrath not just bandaged the wounds he didn't just pour on oil and wine but
[time=2630] instead pours on grace and mercy and more grace and more mercy he's the true and better Samaritan
[time=2637] who gave his life not just let out his donkey he's the true and better Samaritan who pays our entire
[time=2645] debt not just a few days wages he's the one who saves us not just from robbers and a few days of
[time=2652] recovery but from the power of sin and an eternity in hell the trajectory of the parable is clear
[time=2662] it's about Jesus it's about who he was and what he came to do and the lawyer needed to see that
[time=2669] and I need to see that and you need to see that every human person needs to come to an understanding
[time=2678] of the beauty and the glory and the grace and the mercy of Jesus Christ he's the true and better
[time=2687] Samaritan so an application two points today one that has more spiritual connotations
[time=2698] the second more that has physical but they both kind of overlap the first thing is this what we have to take from this parable is that we cannot justify ourselves
[time=2708] we can't declare ourselves righteous that was a burden too heavy for anyone to bear
[time=2715] whether you know Christ today or whether you don't know Christ today you cannot justify yourself
[time=2721] you cannot gain your salvation nor maintain your salvation by your good works
[time=2727] you see there is a gospel road I call it that focuses on the the cross of Calvary and what we're
[time=2736] tempted to do is either to go to the right or the left when we go to the right we try to overperform
[time=2743] we say okay I've messed up but you know what tomorrow I'm going to be better tomorrow I'm going to do this thing way better you'll see God it's going to go much better tomorrow
[time=2754] we either try to overperform on the one side or on the other side we just give up it's despair
[time=2760] I can't do this I've messed up again I'm just going to wallow in my sin and my shame and my guilt
[time=2768] and my condemnation but Jesus says oh no there's a better way than trying to overperform there's a better way than despair focus your eyes on me I'm the one I'm the one who went to the cross
[time=2781] and when I went to the cross I became guilty of your lust and I became guilty of your line
[time=2787] and I became guilty of your dishonesty and I became guilty of all the things that you've done
[time=2797] so that if you've placed your faith and trust in me you're no longer guilty anymore but I give you my perfect life oh don't try to justify yourself Jesus says come to me all you who
[time=2811] are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest second application the Christian life
[time=2823] should manifest itself in acts of unparalleled kindness it should manifest itself in great
[time=2831] generosity selflessness love and obedience but these things should not be done because we feel
[time=2839] like we have to do them or we're obligated to do them and these things cannot be done apart from
[time=2846] Christ because we have no ability in ourselves to accomplish these things you see the distinctiveness
[time=2853] of our Christian faith is this that the distinctiveness comes in that our kindness and our generosity and our selflessness and love and obedience flows out of only one source
[time=2866] our kindness flows out of the kindness we've received at Calvary our generosity flows out of
[time=2874] the generosity we received as a result of Christ's poverty our selflessness can only be a result
[time=2882] of the selflessness we benefited from when Jesus left the perfection of heaven to come down to earth
[time=2888] our love flows out of the love we get to bask in every day as the Father delights in us not because
[time=2896] of our own merits because of the merits of Christ imputed to us and our obedience is fueled by the
[time=2903] obedience of Christ to his Father in the garden as he was willing to be maligned and beaten and
[time=2910] mistreated and crucified the very next day for our salvation you see those acts whether it's generosity or obedience or selflessness or love
[time=2923] they can only flow out of what Christ has done for us if they're going to be truly Christian
[time=2936] so as we think about a couple things with our congregation here this immediate body
[time=2942] we're heading into a series we're heading into a time where we're going to be talking about
[time=2949] gifts that go and supporting as our own and as we think about giving to that cause
[time=2955] our obedience to that giving has to flow from our gratitude for what he has done second
[time=2963] Corinthians chapter eight is talking about how Paul is calling the believers to support the
[time=2970] persecuted church in Jerusalem and he says this to them he says for you know the grace of God
[time=2976] that though he was rich he became poor for your sakes that those who are poor might become rich
[time=2984] in him you see this money it's never going to do for you what you think it will do
[time=2990] it will not bring you the security you're chasing it will not bring you the prestige
[time=2996] or whatever it is that you think that you want it to do for you because only Jesus can do that and when you start to think about that money becomes something that is way less important to you and now all of a sudden when you realize that Christ entered into poverty and oppression
[time=3014] for you so that you who were helpless and hopeless might become rich in him now it's oh God I just
[time=3021] want to give I don't have to I know I don't have to I just want to and so I encourage you
[time=3030] as you think about gifts that go in the next month to come back to just be grateful and thankful
[time=3036] and another understanding of who God is and what he's done for you next Saturday we have the big serve
[time=3043] Saturday the 16th you can sign up in the hallway afterwards but I encourage you that service
[time=3051] should only flow out of the fact that Jesus has served you and rescued you and redeemed you and
[time=3060] been kind to you and now out of that go and serve so in conclusion this morning
[time=3069] two more minutes do you realize that the Bible never calls the Samaritan good
[time=3079] the Bible doesn't say the good Samaritan the only way only way it says that is at the title of
[time=3087] the verses that follow which is something that man put in right the Bible doesn't define the
[time=3094] Samaritan and good this is something we've placed on him but he is only good compared to the priest
[time=3100] and the Levite who passed by without doing anything but we need to go back to what the rich young
[time=3107] ruler said what Jesus said the rich young ruler in Mark 10 he said good teacher what must I do to eternal life Jesus said why do you call me good no one is good except God
[time=3118] to who are we or to whom are we comparing ourselves you see the only way for you and I and every other
[time=3127] human to gain eternal life is to recognize our great need and to run to Jesus who is the only one
[time=3135] who is done what the law has required and who is willing to die the death that I deserve and give me
[time=3141] the perfect life that he lived two thousand years ago Jesus looked with love at this lawyer and said
[time=3151] to him this keeping the law thing you can't do this but I can and I did on your behalf so that you
[time=3160] don't have to strive anymore just rest in my finished work at Calvary today he says to you
[time=3169] you can't be good enough to either gain or maintain your eternal life but I am and I was on your
[time=3178] behalf so that you don't have to strive anymore just rest in my finished work at Calvary and out of
[time=3185] this rest then love enjoy serve and rejoice in me Jesus I'm going to ask the band to come up and
[time=3195] I've asked Jonathan to lead us in a new song a song that I'm excited to sing this morning I'm
[time=3201] excited for you to have the opportunity to sing in response to the great Samaritan and I'm going to read the lyrics to you right now says this I am frail broken easily without fail my strength
[time=3215] keeps failing me all alone I'm powerless to lift myself from the pit that I am in verse two from
[time=3223] your throne in heaven's light descended down into my broken life to right the wrong to make a way
[time=3229] to bear the load that I deserve to bear alone verse three on the cross on our behalf the son of
[time=3236] God bore the father's wrath and by his blood the scars and pain the perfect son took the fall
[time=3243] and took our place final verse in his grace and unfailing love the risen king gave his hand to us
[time=3252] to lift us up from the pit and set our feet upon a rock that ever stands and so the chorus goes I
[time=3262] need you Jesus I need you I need clean hands I can't you can I need you Jesus
[time=3276] I am frail broken easily without fail my strength keeps failing me
[time=3289] all alone I'm powerless to lift myself from the pit that I am in

[time=3380] on the cross on our behalf the son of God bore the father's wrath and by his blood the scars
[time=3397] to hate the perfect son took the fall and took our place oh I need you jesus
[time=3410] I need you jesus I need clean hands I can't you can
[time=3426] I need you jesus
