[time=30] >> Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=36] It's great to have you with us and great to have a few minutes together here.
[time=41] My name is Kelly Bird.
[time=42] For those of you who maybe have never watched the broadcast or had the opportunity to know us here at Black Hawk, we're grateful to get to know you in times like this.
[time=52] Thankful for this broadcast that has for years and years and years been Black Hawk's gift and our effort to encourage this community with a life saving, eternity altering truth of God's word.
[time=65] And we mean that, we believe God's word is actually that powerful.
[time=70] We believe the word of God can actually change your life and alter your eternity.
[time=75] And what a privilege for us to try to just do our best to teach it and explain it each week in a way that we hope makes a difference in your life.
[time=84] >> Hey, as we go forward here toward the end of November, I can't believe I'm saying that, but Thanksgiving's right around the corner.
[time=91] And then as many of you know, and some of you might not know, December around Black Hawk's a really special time.
[time=97] We call it Christmas with Black Hawk.
[time=99] And every Sunday in the month of December is a celebration of the great gift of Christ and the great celebration of his birth.
[time=109] And so I want to just invite you, if you've been thinking about, if you've been toying with the idea.
[time=114] If you've been wondering where there might be a church for you to connect with, some people who you could kind of begin to build relationship with, an opportunity for you and or your family to be in a setting where you're going to be encouraged and challenged and given the opportunity to be a part of something that is beyond you, I would love for you to come and visit us and be a part of what's going on this Christmas here in the Black Hawk family.
[time=140] So come and join us. Our website is right here at the bottom of the screen, blackhawkministries.org. You can find out a lot about us at our site,
[time=150] but more than anything, we'd love for you to come on a Sunday morning.
[time=154] At nine or 1045, we'd love to meet you and better get to know you and help you make a connection with us that we think could be really, really encouraging.
[time=163] So come see us. God bless you for tuning in. I hope today's an encouragement to you.
[time=168] And we'll hope to see you in person in December. We'll see you then. Bye-bye.

[time=542] I love you. Christ alone. Cornerstone. We can make strong
[time=555] in the same as love to the strong. He is the Lord, the Lord of God.
[time=571] Darkness seems to hide His face. I rest on this unchanging grace.
[time=586] In every house, stormy day. My goal is within. My ankle holds. My ankle holds within the bay.
[time=608] Christ alone. Cornerstone. We can make strong in the same as love to the strong.

[time=722] He is righteousness alone.
[time=745] What a great privilege to be with all of you this morning.
[time=748] We are thankful that you are here. My name is Kelly.
[time=750] If we have never met, I have the privilege of serving on the team here at Black Hawk and we genuinely look forward to times like this where we get to be with people like you.
[time=759] You may be new in the last couple of weeks, last couple of months.
[time=764] If you haven't gone by the guest center, please do so.
[time=767] Stop by the guest center on your way out today.
[time=769] Let them say hello to you. Let them give you some more information that may help you get better connected here at Black Hawk. We are grateful that you are here.
[time=777] I want you to do this before we start. You are sitting in sections, and most of you always sit in the same section. There are a few of you that try and hide from me, but I find
[time=788] you eventually as the morning goes on. But you are sitting in sections and we want you as the days go by to maybe get to know a little bit more about those in your section.
[time=798] Just want it to be a place of reference, a point where you can just greet and say hello.
[time=802] So stand up and say hello to some people in your section.
[time=806] Introduce yourself if you don't know them, say hi to them, and make sure they know that you're glad they're here.
[time=833] >> All right. Hey, great job. Thanks for doing that.
[time=844] Hey, I want to say thanks to those of you who came and helped yesterday morning with our big serve.
[time=855] We do it on a somewhat regular basis. I'm so grateful for the work that duty and Dray Baker,
[time=861] Luke Sefton, they give leadership on a regular basis to student ministries. They put the entire
[time=867] morning together, grateful for those of you who came and helped us serve the real and physical
[time=873] needs of a lot of people in our neighborhood and community. It was great to be able to do it with you, thankful for all of those who came. And I hope those of you who didn't come will just keep an ear open for the next big serve opportunity. It is a great, great chance for us to make a
[time=890] real difference in the lives of people right here in this area. And I'm grateful that we got to do
[time=896] that yesterday. I want to invite all of you to come back tonight at six o'clock. You've heard us talking about this. You've seen the posters and the signs around campus for 10 years. Black Hawk
[time=907] has been hosting the Willow Creek Global Leadership Summit. Just this past August, we moved it from
[time=914] our site here down to the Grand Wayne Center. Saw about 900 people from our community and region
[time=920] come and be a part of it. We're hoping for 1,500 to 2,000 people next August. It is something that
[time=927] God is using in significant ways in the lives of moms and dads and high school kids and business
[time=934] owners from CEOs to factory workers. The leadership summit is for everybody because it challenges you
[time=942] and it teaches you and it helps you understand how you can make an impact in the world that God
[time=948] has you in. And so what we're doing to further our leadership development around here and to further
[time=956] the encouragement that is there to be had for all of you. We're taking three dates, one in November
[time=963] tonight and then one in January, the 12th, I think, and then one in April. We're going to come back and revisit the summit. We're calling it leadership summit on demand. We're going to watch three of the highest rated sessions from this past August, the first one being tonight Bill Heibel's session
[time=981] on courageous leadership. I hope you'll come back. There's no cost and if you haven't ever experienced the summit, this will give you a taste of what it's like and I'm so thankful many are
[time=991] coming tonight. We're going to meet right here, watch that session, talk about it a bit, kind of break it down, do a little Q&A and really be encouraged so I hope you'll be back. Please come back tonight at six if you will. Hey, let me ask you, all of you, let me ask all of you a
[time=1010] question this morning and I want you to have absolute freedom in the way that you would answer
[time=1017] this. Jake, would you hand me that plate right there sitting next to you buddy? The question I have for you is, is this, what comes to your mind when you see one of these?
[time=1031] When you see one of these making its way down the road toward you, when you see one of these being
[time=1039] walked down an aisle, when in the midst of your place here in this ministry or in other settings
[time=1046] that you find yourself, what comes to your mind when you see one of these coming your way? What
[time=1052] kind of feelings do one of these stir up inside you? What are your honest, unedited thoughts?
[time=1060] What opinions do you carry with you about the offering plate, money and ministry,
[time=1069] giving and the church and all that it represents? You know, I've been talking to and listening to
[time=1076] people on the church and money discussion for a long time. I've been in and around the giving
[time=1083] discussion for most all of my 26 years of ministry and over all these years I've learned some things
[time=1090] about how people typically approach this. There are some observations that I've made and some insights
[time=1098] that have been gleaned and as we jump into this discussion today I thought I'd just share with you some of what I have encountered over the years. Two weeks ago I had the privilege of standing here
[time=1110] in kind of a family meeting and talking with you honestly about God's design for leadership in the church. There's a way in which God has designed us to be led. There's a way
[time=1122] in which God designed the church to function. I'm so grateful for His design. I'm so grateful for the Word of God in the direction it gives us. God also has a lot to say about this. God's Word
[time=1135] has a lot to say about our relationship with money, the way in which we handle our resources and yes
[time=1142] even the issue of giving in the local church and so this morning I hope you'll allow God's Word to encourage you. I hope you'll allow God's Word to give you some insight and some understanding into
[time=1153] the way you think and feel and interact with this. I want this to be an encouraging thing. I want it
[time=1159] to be something that's helpful and healthy and so let's jump in just some observations
[time=1165] initially just some things I've seen over the years that I'm sure many of you have experienced or felt as well and hopefully we can learn from some of this. Some of you, observation number one,
[time=1177] some of you, not all of you, but some of you, when you see this coming down the road toward you,
[time=1188] some of you have a tendency to think someone else will do it. Someone else will do it.
[time=1199] You sort of say to yourself this opportunity right here, you sort of convince yourself this opportunity isn't for me. It's for someone else, someone who makes more money than you,
[time=1211] someone who's been here at this church longer than you, someone who's more connected, more able,
[time=1218] or more vested than you, someone else you think in your mind will do it. Side note, these are at
[time=1224] times the same people who say to themselves someone else will serve in children's ministry.
[time=1230] These sometimes are the same people who say someone else will show up Saturday morning and do
[time=1236] the big serve. There is in all of us at times this tendency to sort of pass the buck of opportunity
[time=1245] and/or responsibility to others. The someone else will do it mindset that at times can run rampant
[time=1257] in and through our family. So what does the Bible say to those who may be inclined at times to see
[time=1265] the offering plate as a responsibility or opportunity for others? I just want you to look if you will
[time=1272] in your Bibles or on your iPads or on your phones. However it is, you're viewing the Scripture this morning. Look at 1 Corinthians 16 verse 2. It says it very clearly. It says it very plainly. Sometimes
[time=1283] we might even just kind of skip over it, but I want to make sure this morning that we look at it and that we at least at a very foundational level understand this really is how God designed
[time=1295] this giving thing to work. It says in 1 Corinthians 16, 2, on the first day of every week
[time=1303] each or you say it. What does that say? Each, say it again? Each one of you. On the first day of every
[time=1313] week, each one of you, Paul writes to the church at Corinth, each one of you is to put aside and
[time=1320] save as he may prosper so that no collections will be made until I come. And then when I come and
[time=1326] the offering plate gets passed, so to speak, every one of you, he says, will have made your
[time=1334] contribution. This isn't for them. This isn't for someone else. This is something he gives you,
[time=1344] you as part of a family. It's part of the body of Christ. 2 Corinthians 9 says the same thing.
[time=1350] In the NLT it reads this way, "You must each of you decide in your heart how much to give. You must,
[time=1358] you being who, you being you, each and every one of us as part of the family of God."
[time=1367] In any discussion regarding God's design for New Testament giving each and every person,
[time=1373] each and every individual must see themselves as being called by God to engage in this,
[time=1380] to actively give, and not just actively give, but you go back to 16 verse 2 even I would say
[time=1388] consistently because there it says on the first day of every week. This is something that on a
[time=1396] regular basis each and every one of us are to actively and consistently engage in.
[time=1403] You see this church thing my friends really is about family. This church endeavor really is the
[time=1413] ultimate team and every piece and every part and every member here in this matters. There might be,
[time=1423] there might be others who make more than you.
[time=1427] There may be others who have been here longer than you or have more invested than you, but you know
[time=1436] what? We're family and you're in and you're part of us and we don't succeed as a family
[time=1444] unless everyone contributes. That's just the way families work. Everybody rolls up their sleeves
[time=1453] everybody makes the contribution they can make and when everybody's making it, it is as God designed it to be. Now right here in that little thing I just said there might be some
[time=1467] of you in the room who might kind of feel like as I say that okay thank you I think I'm going to I think I'm going to take a pass on this because I'm not really part of the family yet Kelly. You
[time=1478] all have made me feel like I can be here as I think these things through and there are people here.
[time=1484] I'm so grateful that you're here and you aren't in yet. You haven't fully surrendered your heart
[time=1490] and life to Christ, but we've made you feel like it's okay to sit in one of these seats and be in
[time=1497] this room and so when this starts making its way by I want you to hear it from me. Yeah this is for
[time=1504] this is for those who are in and you may feel compelled to give you may feel like you want to give if you want to that's fine. I want you to know that as part of the family of Blackhawk
[time=1515] we see it as something that's extremely important and extremely necessary and you keep thinking
[time=1523] through what you're thinking through. You keep asking your spiritual questions. You keep moving
[time=1529] down that road. I hope one day soon I hope we get you. I hope we get to have you in the family and
[time=1536] believe me it has nothing to do with this. We don't we don't want this as it relates to you we want
[time=1544] your heart the Lord wants your heart and believe me when the Lord has your heart all this works itself
[time=1551] out it really can so just please side note we're thankful that you're here if you're still thinking
[time=1557] spiritual things through. For those of you who are part of the family though this is something that God
[time=1563] this is something that God makes available and this is something God prioritizes for those of us
[time=1570] who are in. Others of you second observation others of you when you see one of these coming
[time=1576] down the aisle the feeling or the thought you have is where does all the money go. Sometimes
[time=1585] when people see the offering plate it's met with a healthy sometimes even unhealthy skepticism
[time=1593] where does all the money that goes into this thing end up. Sometimes the thought is a question
[time=1600] and sometimes the question due to bad experiences in the past sometimes the question can get asked
[time=1608] where they distrusting or critical tone there are also times when it may get asked out of an honest
[time=1615] ignorance. Sometimes people just don't understand how the money thing in the church really works
[time=1621] and to be quite honest with you I think we think it's a really healthy thing for you to understand
[time=1629] to a degree how this money and the church thing works and so I'm going to give you right now
[time=1635] just anybody who knows me this won't shock you this is not going to be an exhaustive detailed look at all of how the money thing works but I got with Mark Arnes who oversees
[time=1645] everything fiscal around here and I just want you to understand there is a spiritual side to this
[time=1651] that's really important yes your contribution to this has a lot to do with transformed and
[time=1659] changed lives yes the contribution you make to this is directly tied to the gospel going forward
[time=1667] on a number of different fronts in a number of different ways but your contribution and your faithfulness to this also also has to do with some very practical things and so Mark put a list
[time=1679] together for me and I want to just go over this list with you remember we're a family and our
[time=1685] family here in some ways it functions just like your family our budget in some ways sort of
[time=1691] works like yours we have a mortgage our mortgage balance is maybe a little higher than yours I don't
[time=1698] know 596 thousand dollars that's our mortgage that's our family's kind of home mortgage if you will
[time=1708] that's what's kind of sitting out there and every month we're on the line to pay a monthly payment
[time=1715] of four thousand three hundred dollars we have a mortgage we have a mortgage payment we have I
[time=1721] had Mark put together annual all of our insurances all of our taxes all of our utilities you want
[time=1727] to keep the lights on if you will two hundred and sixty thousand dollars two hundred and sixty
[time=1734] thousand one hundred dollars is what we pay on a regular basis for insurance taxes and utilities
[time=1741] when you see one of these coming down the aisle and you start to think about missionaries global ministry local people who do ministry for us that we support and global people who are out in places
[time=1753] far far away two hundred and thirty two thousand dollars two thirty two eighty four on an annual
[time=1760] basis from your contributions and your giving going to ministry missions work here and across
[time=1767] the world all staff everybody who works here everybody who's on our payroll everyone who's
[time=1773] helping this thing move forward one million two hundred thirteen thousand seven hundred and twenty
[time=1780] five dollars and in my opinion every one of them worth every penny of it i'm grateful for our team
[time=1786] and thankful for the way that they give themselves to ministry these are people who clean toilets
[time=1792] these are people who vacuum carpets these are people who answer phones these are people who preach sermons these are folks who give leadership to children's and student ministries these are people who do a myriad of things in a very faithful and excellent way and i'm grateful for all that they
[time=1808] do and then i just picked up one of our ministries the bible hour for instance on an annual basis the bible hour cost us about a hundred thousand dollars a year to have that as part of what we're
[time=1819] doing and that just kind of gives you a that gives you a look at kind of the practical side
[time=1825] of some of what goes on somebody figured it out for me maybe somebody right now is doing this sometimes you get numbers on a screen people start figuring out percentages and they start figuring out totals somebody figured out for me first hour that one way you can look at this is
[time=1841] when it comes to people that we're investing in when it comes to missionary local and global
[time=1848] and staff on the ground here in this complex and around the city here when you talk about our staff and our missionaries it's about twenty nine thousand dollars a week you see in our bulletin
[time=1860] that our number each week is about forty two so twenty nine of the forty two goes to supporting
[time=1867] coming alongside caring for those who are engaged in full-time ministry here and around the world
[time=1874] first Timothy 5 17 i just want you to see this um it may appear self-serving for me to say this
[time=1881] please hear me this isn't let me make my point the elders who rule well are to be considered worthy
[time=1888] of double honor especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching i'll just stop you're
[time=1894] right there and i just want you to know again in god's design he has it set up that in the church
[time=1901] those who would be in this case on our staff those who you would be paying and those who you would be
[time=1909] hiring those who give leadership on a daily basis to the ministry of our church and yes even those
[time=1916] who preach and teach there to be cared for there to be supported and there to be supported generously
[time=1923] because of the work they do and i want you to know we take that very seriously i want you to know we have a gifted staff that work very hard at what they do when we find weaknesses in us when we see
[time=1936] things that we should do better when we realize there's opportunities for growth i want you to know you have a staff of people who take it very seriously and give themselves to growth and progress to be the kind of staff to be the kind of shepherds to be the kinds of leaders that are worthy of your support your faith and your encouragement so i'm grateful so this thing this offering plate can
[time=1959] get can get people feeling or thinking all kinds of things some people see the offering plate coming
[time=1966] and they think to themselves this i've bumped into this i've felt this personally many of you in the
[time=1972] room maybe have felt this you start to think about all the struggles you have maybe even currently on
[time=1979] the financial front there's people who see this and they start to think in themselves you know there's people i owe there's there's needs i can't seem to meet there's financial pressure that at
[time=1991] times feels crushing holes so deep i just can't seem to dig out and so sometimes the thought when
[time=1999] people see this coming is i'll just do a little i'll just do a little and that might be for a
[time=2010] season of your life and your relationship with him that might be what you should do but let me just let me encourage you this morning let me remind you by way of just kind of drawing your attention
[time=2021] back to some people who were in some financial struggle themselves let me just show you how they
[time=2027] respond and let me show you their approach i believe it's god honoring and i want you to turn
[time=2033] with me to second Corinthians chapter eight if you would second Corinthians chapter eight versus one
[time=2039] to four paul in his second letter to the church at Corinth talks to them he commends the church in
[time=2048] Macedonia for the way in which they approached if you will the offering plate the way in which they approached their chance to give to the ministry and i want you to see this with me second
[time=2059] Corinthians eight verse one now brethren we wish to make known to you the grace of god which has been given in the churches of Macedonia here the offering is connected to the grace of god we'll
[time=2070] come back to that it says in verse two that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy
[time=2079] and their deep poverty when mixed together their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed
[time=2087] in the wealth of their liberality for i testify that according to their ability and beyond their
[time=2095] ability they gave of their own accord begging us these people who were in this great ordeal of
[time=2103] affliction living in deep poverty it says in verse four they begged us with much urging
[time=2111] for the favor for the opportunity of participation in the support of the saints are you are you young
[time=2120] in your faith today and interested in god's design forgiving are you asking yourself these
[time=2126] days how does god want me to approach my money the church and this concept of generosity you couldn't
[time=2133] find four better verses you couldn't find four better verses than these right here look with me
[time=2139] at second Corinthians eight i want to show you the approach i believe god wants us to have here we go your financial giving to your local church should be we're going to look at four things here and i
[time=2151] just hope you'll write these down number one it should be unconditionally it should be unconditionally
[time=2158] gracious joyful and liberal it should be gracious it should be joyful it should be liberal we see all
[time=2169] three of these things in the first two verses look with me at verse one now brethren we wish to make known to you the grace of god the grace of god which has been given in the churches of massadonia
[time=2184] here what's being given this financial offering is connected pictorially he paints this picture of it
[time=2192] being connected to the grace of god and you're you're giving and my giving should be in essence
[time=2201] marked by it should be characterized by grace it's going to people it's going to situations
[time=2208] let's see mercy mercy is not getting what you do deserve grace is when you what grace is when you
[time=2216] get what you don't deserve grace is just given grace is just offered grace is just it's just
[time=2227] freely doled out and he's making this connection between the gift and the grace of god and he says
[time=2233] in verse one the grace of god was seen in this giving of the gift it was given graciously oh that
[time=2240] you're giving and mine would be gracious unconditional unconditional this takes into account nowhere
[time=2252] do we see here anything about the people or what they deserved or what they were doing in no way at
[time=2260] all do we see anything conditional about this it was just their privilege and their honor to give
[time=2269] so it's gracious joyful look at verse two that in a great ordeal of affliction their lives were
[time=2275] an absolute turmoil that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep
[time=2284] poverty come together and i just want you to stop and just think about that here we have people who
[time=2290] were in a great ordeal of affliction they were being persecuted they were being tested they were
[time=2297] being tried their lives were absolutely up against the wall and they had this joy and we've taught
[time=2303] you this before let me remind you today joy is not a giddy feeling joy is that deep internal realization
[time=2312] it's that deep very personal realization that you can choose to put your arms around
[time=2319] that a loving heavenly father is thoughtfully and with purpose orchestrating the events of your life
[time=2327] no mistakes he's still on the throne nothing got passed him whatever's going on in your world today
[time=2337] a loving heavenly father with great thought and purpose is orchestrating the events of your life
[time=2344] and he is a father you can trust he is a god you can follow and so you choose to have joy there is a
[time=2353] peace and there is a contentment there is a i'm okay with this because i'm with you mindset and they
[time=2361] had it and so their lives are in turmoil they have this abundance of joy and they have absolutely
[time=2368] nothing they live in poverty they got poverty here they got affliction here and their right smack
[time=2376] dab in the middle with this joy and when it comes to their financial giving it it all comes together
[time=2383] and it equals that's kind of cool for those of you watching online there is thunder and lightning
[time=2392] going on outside and god is speaking let's pass the plate right now what do you say
[time=2401] seriously get the greeters come on in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed
[time=2413] in the wealth in the wealth of their liberality your giving should be liberal
[time=2422] that's not like democrat conservative republican no it's liberal meaning like it should it should overflow it should just be more than anybody would think
[time=2435] liberality it goes over the the word literally means to go over the line to go over the edge it
[time=2442] literally means to overflow and people who love god and trust him and who understand the opportunity
[time=2449] they've been given to be a part of his kingdom going forward through the local church no matter the affliction no matter the poverty it equals joy and they give out of that and know how thankful
[time=2460] how thankful we are to have that opportunity secondly write this down it's so it's supposed to be proportionate really the bulk of his teaching here on giving comes in this one verse verse three
[time=2471] number two it's supposed to be proportionate for i testify that according look at it there according to their ability stop right there you are to give in god's design as it relates to
[time=2484] ministry in the local church we're to give according to our ability and that's for now let's go back
[time=2492] who is involved in the giving just a few no who everyone so everyone is to give according
[time=2500] proportionately to their ability all right so we'll just quick little visual for you okay
[time=2506] Jake stand up right there where you are my son Jake everybody say hi Jake Matt Hicks would you stand up right there Jake and Matt are friends so this won't be awkward for them Matt's right here everybody say hi Matt all right Matt you got a job how long have you
[time=2520] been working at your job how many 16 years full time take care of your family great job
[time=2529] Jake doesn't have a job but i know Jake in the last couple weeks has made what do you say 10 15 bucks say yes please thank you so he makes about 10 15 bucks i would guess i'm not sure i
[time=2545] think matt makes a little bit more so matt's over here part of our family orthopedic surgeon and he
[time=2554] has his job and Jake's 13 years old and he takes the garbage out and he does a pretty good job with
[time=2560] that and he has a few other things maybe 15 bucks in the last couple of weeks all i'm saying is that
[time=2566] wherever you are in this this is proportionate Jake's gift Jake's relationship with this matters
[time=2576] and we're trying to teach him that it matters all those numbers you saw on the screen
[time=2583] it matters matt's relationship to this proportionate to what God has given matt it matters
[time=2590] whoever you are thanks guys you can sit down whoever you are whatever you've been given
[time=2597] your relationship to this in God's design oh it matters it matters greatly your giving is to be
[time=2604] proportionate based upon what you've been given you've got to think through how you're
[time=2610] going to give that back now he gives you a little bit more help here because he goes on in the next phrase having said in verse three to give according to your ability then he says
[time=2621] and they gave beyond their ability he says they gave beyond what they've been given the proportion
[time=2634] the amount that you and i are to give yes it's supposed to be based on what we've been given
[time=2640] but it's supposed to be an amount that stretches you it's to be an amount that pushes you
[time=2646] it's to be an amount that makes you quite frankly maybe even a little uncomfortable it is to be in a word sacrificial what does sacrificial mean what does it mean to sacrifice
[time=2661] on the giving front let me just try and be really basic with you it means i give this up
[time=2667] it means i go without this it means i say no to this it means i make a decision to go without this
[time=2676] in order for me to give more of this and listen you figure it out
[time=2687] we don't get into all that we're not here in any way shape or form to manipulate or twist
[time=2694] we're here to give you what this says and to invite you to think that through in your heart
[time=2702] before god 15 bucks every couple weeks to wherever else that continuum goes it's to be
[time=2712] gracious it's to be done liberally it's to be done according to that which has been given
[time=2721] it's to be done sacrificially oh on the sacrifice front there's no there's no better example
[time=2727] just real quick turn look at mark 12 would you real quick i'm going to wrap this up in a few
[time=2733] minutes stay tuned here stay with me mark 1241 what a great reminder for each and every one of us
[time=2742] mark 1241 jesus sits down it says here in verse 41 and he sat down opposite the treasury his
[time=2748] disciples are with him he sits down opposite the treasury and began observing how the people were
[time=2755] putting money into the treasury he's watching this right here he's watching the plate thing go on
[time=2761] and many rich people were putting in large sums and then in 42 a poor widow king and put in two
[time=2769] small copper coins which amount to a cent which amount to a cent
[time=2775] calling his disciples to him he said to them truly i say to you this poor widow put in more
[time=2782] than all the contributors to the treasury for they all put in out of their what say at church
[time=2790] surplus oh be careful with that friends be careful with that they all put in out of their surplus
[time=2798] but she out of her poverty put in all she owned and all she had to live on
[time=2805] you know 10% is something that's been used a lot in teaching on giving we've talked about that
[time=2812] before i've used that as a a guide in the past i don't think that necessarily 10% is
[time=2822] awesome amen brother why don't you say amen to that thank you
[time=2828] 10% is not a bad deal at all in the Old Testament there was a percentage
[time=2837] really in the Old Testament it was 33 when you added them all up in the New Testament there
[time=2845] isn't anything said about percentages nothing not a thing in the New Testament what's said is what
[time=2853] we've just talked about this morning and so here's the point 10% might be for somebody in the room
[time=2860] this morning really sacrificial right 10% for other people in the room might not even you might not
[time=2870] even blink at it so be careful what you do with the 10% thing be careful and don't give out of your
[time=2877] surplus proverbs 3 says proverbs 3 talks about this thing called first fruits proverbs 3 talks
[time=2886] about this principle of whenever you or i get paid whenever it is we come in contact with our resources there's this biblical principle of right off the what right off the top we say here
[time=2899] here's my joyful here's my sacrificial here's my proportionate gift one more thing
[time=2905] leads us to really the last point and i kind of just talked about it the last point that we get in this little insightful passage in second Corinthians 8 your giving should be
[time=2917] personal your giving should be personal and voluntary they gave it says in second Corinthians
[time=2927] 8 13 it says they gave of their own accord you see that second Corinthians 8 13 it says they gave
[time=2937] of their own accord in God's design you don't give due to pressure or manipulation i'm so sorry if
[time=2944] there are people in this room who have experienced this i apologize i hope you've never experienced
[time=2950] it here and we don't ever want this to happen there are those though who have found themselves in situations where on the giving front it's all about pressure and manipulation in God's design you don't give reluctantly second Corinthians 9 7 you never give reluctantly or
[time=2966] under compulsion it never is to be done out of guilt or shame but instead it is to be done out
[time=2973] of gratitude and joy for God loves a what say it a cheerful giver a cheerful giver who gets it
[time=2984] a cheerful happy grateful giver who understands what this is really about and the opportunity it
[time=2993] provides us to move the kingdom forward i'm going to have the band come up and we're going to sing this morning many of you gave offerings financially this morning and we're grateful for that let's let's stand together would you as a family and let's give him an offering i'm going to say just a few more things before we close but first let's give him an offering of our praise
[time=3013] let's give him an offering of our of our song and let's do it as a family who is truly and absolutely
[time=3021] grateful for all that he has provided let's sing let's worship our god in spirit and in truth
[time=3033] i'm going to start singing the splendor of a king
[time=3062] and darkness tries to hide troubles at his voice it troubles at his voice sing how great
[time=3076] and how great is our god sing me how great is our god
[time=3090] all let's see how great how great is our god
[time=3099] i need to wait too long age to age his steps
[time=3112] times in his hands beginning and the end beginning and the end

[time=3180] great is our god all let's see how great how great is our god
[time=3196] sing one piece like the river
[time=3203] attendeth my way and when sorrows like sea
[time=3218] billows roll whatever my love now has taught me to say it is well it is where
[time=3241] with my soul he's the name above all names
[time=3248] and he's the name above all names worthy of all ways
[time=3262] and my heart will sing how great is our god
[time=3272] the name above all names and he's the name above all names
[time=3281] he's worthy of all ways and my heart will sing how great is our god
[time=3298] how great is our god sing with me how great is our god
[time=3312] and all will see how great how great is our god
[time=3328] so what should your response be what should your mindset be as you see this come in your way i want to just uh i want to leave you with this uh don't ever let it be
[time=3340] you holding back don't ever let it be you withholding what god's put on your heart to do
[time=3349] and i don't say that with me in mind i don't say that with us in mind look at what it says
[time=3356] in malachi malachi chapter three it says this it says bring the what say it bring the whole thing
[time=3366] it says now watch bring the whole tithe into the store house so that there may be food in my house
[time=3372] and test me the god of heaven says go ahead please test me on this let me show you he says
[time=3381] test me now in this says the lord of host if i will not open for you the windows of heaven
[time=3388] and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows a blessing for you amen so i'm encouraging you
[time=3399] don't do not hold it back if you're upset about something don't hold it back if you've got something
[time=3407] going on on the side financially in your life and you feel like you've got to don't hold it back
[time=3413] don't hold back what god puts on your heart to give because when you give it you get to experience the blessing and the favor of god as he pours it out on your heart and life
[time=3425] so grateful that we could do this and so thankful that we can give even as we look forward to
[time=3433] december you say we're we're 50 000 or so dollars behind on giving it's right there in the bulletin
