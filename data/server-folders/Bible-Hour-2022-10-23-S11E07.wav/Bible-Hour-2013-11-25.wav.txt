[time=693] >> Well, good morning, and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=698] It's great to be with you, and I'm so thankful that you'll get to see what happened this Sunday morning.
[time=705] It is a very special morning, a sad, but exciting morning, all at the same time.
[time=710] December 1st is the day we've sort of been looking forward to Corbin Miller, who has been our friend and fellow servant and worship pastor here at Black Hawk the last 12 years.
[time=722] This is the last Sunday for a while that Corbin will be leading worship here at Black Hawk.
[time=727] He and his wife Tanya and their kids are on their way, as many of you know, on their way to Poland with an amazing ministry called Josiah Venture.
[time=735] To be missionaries in a place far, far away, and while we're grateful, very grateful for God's calling in that direction,
[time=743] we're going to miss them terribly.
[time=745] So this morning was a very special experience for us as Corbin led our congregation, our church family here at Black Hawk in worship for the last time.
[time=754] I hope that you will, those of you who have watched the broadcast over the years, those of you who have grown to kind of know and love him,
[time=762] and I know many of you are thankful for the ministry that he's had here at Black Hawk and on our broadcast.
[time=769] I hope that you'll pray for him. I pray that in the days to come, God will bring he and Tanya and their kids to mind.
[time=775] And I ask that you would with us lift them up as they head into an entirely new season and chapter of ministry and life.
[time=784] And I'm so grateful that we got to have this morning together.
[time=787] I want to say to all of you that December is an incredibly special month here at Black Hawk.
[time=793] We call it Christmas with Black Hawk and I hope you'll come.
[time=796] I hope you'll come and join us. I hope you'll come and be a part of these next four Sundays as we lift up in some special ways.
[time=804] The great story of Christmas and the great gift of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=809] Thank you for tuning in. It's great to have you with us and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=818] Today is really special not just because it's the last chance that he gets to lead you in worship for a long time, but it's also special because the way it would go in God's timing and stuff.
[time=830] A friend from Josiah Adventure that Tanya and I've known for over a decade happened to be in town today.
[time=837] Go figure.
[time=839] Drahho, why don't you come on up and I'd love to introduce you to a good friend of ours. Drahho lives in Slovakia.
[time=845] He serves in a city with Josh Howard, another Black Hawk missionary that we've sent over to help with Josiah Adventure.
[time=852] And Drahho is in town today and how long have you been working with Josiah Adventure?
[time=857] It's more than 13 years.
[time=859] Over 13 years. And how recently have you been doing music, the fusion program?
[time=864] It's last two and a half years.
[time=866] Okay, so two and a half years ago this guy moved to a new city in Slovakia and started doing the music program that Tanya and I are going to help some Polish people launch soon.
[time=877] So Drahho is going to show you what God's gifted him to do this morning. He's going to sing for you while the plates get passed and God's really blessed this guy.
[time=889] He could do a lot of things musically in Slovakia, but he's chosen to invest himself in the next generation and to use music as a tool to share the gospel.
[time=900] And we'll get to work together.
[time=902] You probably know that Poland and Slovakia are right next to each other, but if you didn't, we'll be next door neighbors, kind of, kind of.
[time=911] So I ask Drahho if he would pray for our offering today. Greeters, please come forward. When he's done, he's going to sing for you a beautiful song and I hope you enjoy it.
[time=923] I just made a say the word that I'm a little bit in this advantage standing here because on our side, we do rejoice much more probably than you do here.
[time=935] It is hard, but I really want to thank you as a Blackhawk Church, how much you have given, how much you have invested.
[time=944] Not just through Josh Harvard working alongside with us in Slovakia, but sending teams to Slovakia and seeing many young people know in Christ.
[time=958] And that's amazing. Thank you for your obedience and just great heart and I would pray now.
[time=971] Heavenly Father, there is nothing we can give you.
[time=978] Thank you for giving us so much. And when you encourage us that to give is better, I understand that you want to be fully in our hearts.
[time=999] So there is nothing else but you. God, this morning we are thankful for all your grace, for all your love, for all your attention that you have upon our lives.
[time=1012] And we want that our lives would be fully given to you as a sacrifice to you, God. Amen.
[time=1042] [MUSIC - 209 seconds]
[time=1263] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1271] We're going to read in 2 Corinthians 9 this morning about God's encouragement to us to be cheerful givers.
[time=1278] And I know that many of you are in the boat with me. I'm trying really hard to be a cheerful giver to send Corbin and Tanya across the sea, but it's been hard to be cheerful.
[time=1288] To give a gift that would enable them to leave us. But being in God's hands is a great place to be.
[time=1296] So we know that that's what they're going to be, their whole family. Would you pray with me this morning as we begin?
[time=1304] God, thank you so much for today and for the chance to be together. It's been good to sing, to worship you with the songs that we sing, to worship you with the gifts that we give.
[time=1315] And now, God, we have a chance to worship you as we open your word together. So God made the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart for the next few minutes be pleasing to you and in your sight.
[time=1328] God, thank you for the inexpressible gift of your son Jesus. We pray all these things in his name. Amen.
[time=1339] About 500 years before Christ was born, the people of Israel had been allowed to return to their homeland by the Persians.
[time=1352] They were sent into exile with Daniel and people that you know by name sometime before, about 100 years before.
[time=1360] And the Persians said they could go back home and rebuild their temple. Well, they did. They went back home. And about 20 years had passed since they had gotten home for the first time and they got complacent.
[time=1373] And they stopped doing what they were sent home to do. They stopped building the temple, which is in large measure why they came back to do it.
[time=1382] God was very clear through his prophets that that was what they were supposed to be doing and they hadn't.
[time=1387] And friends, this morning we come to this passage and I want to encourage you something that I heard Tim Keller say once and it's this.
[time=1394] That we all are prone to forget things that we should remember and remember things that we should forget.
[time=1402] So I want to remind you this morning of a couple of things from God's Word.
[time=1406] The people of Israel got complacent. They were putting hardwood floors in their houses and granite countertops in their kitchens.
[time=1413] While God's temple sat unbuilt with the foundations being laid and nothing else being done, it was this great testimony of an incomplete restoration.
[time=1427] And the prophet Hagii, there are four books that end the Old Testament, Zephaniah, Hagii, Zechariah and Malachi.
[time=1434] I just want to read a couple of verses from the first chapter of Hagii as we begin this morning.
[time=1440] There's a direct connection to our text in 2 Corinthians 9. This is Hagii chapter 1 verse 6.
[time=1446] This is God's Word through the prophet Hagii to the people of Israel.
[time=1450] You have sewn much and harvested little. You eat, but you never have enough.
[time=1458] Stinging words for the last few days, at least in my house.
[time=1462] You drink, but you never have your fill. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm, and he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes.
[time=1475] What an indictment. He says you have sewn much and harvested little.
[time=1481] God's promise in 2 Corinthians 9 is that if you sow a lot, you're going to reap a lot.
[time=1487] These are farming analogies. I was reminded recently watching a lot of football in the last few days that live in Indiana because there was an advertisement on television for seed, for grain seed during football games.
[time=1501] I lived in Indiana. I was reminded of that in very full force when there was an ad for grain on television during the game itself.
[time=1509] So we all know what that means. We drive past cornfields maybe every day.
[time=1513] If you sow much, you'll harvest much, and that's the promise that we see here in 2 Corinthians 9.
[time=1521] If you have your bulletins this morning, go ahead and take them out. There's notes in there.
[time=1525] You can follow along in the service this morning. One thing to mention on the bottom of this page where the notes are internet access.
[time=1532] If you're wondering about that, how to get online while you're in this room, there are instructions there for you.
[time=1537] They've been there for a while, but wanted to remind you that they're there, which wireless setting to use and what the password is.
[time=1544] It's all there for you to check out. So please do that this morning. If you want to follow along with the Bible apps on your phones,
[time=1552] if you want to check your Facebook stash, you're welcome to do that. You're welcome to tweet during the service.
[time=1557] If you want, that's encouraged. I do it sometimes too.
[time=1561] We're in 2 Corinthians 9 this morning on that page in the bulletin with your notes.
[time=1566] There's two guiding questions that I thought would really help us this morning that I'd like to ask you to write down with me.
[time=1572] Two things at the front to take away. Two things at the start of our time together this morning that will guide these next few minutes.
[time=1581] Here are the questions. Here are the things that we're mindful of. 2 Corinthians 9. Here's the first question.
[time=1588] What caused the Christians in Jerusalem to glorify God and be thankful? That's the first question they had.
[time=1599] They did glorify God and they were thankful. What caused the Christians in Jerusalem to glorify God and to be thankful?
[time=1607] They clearly had. The Corinthians were asked by Paul in a very direct way, "Guys, please give this amazing gift because they're in need
[time=1615] and only you can meet it in the way that you can meet it." They responded in this incredible amount of joy and thankfulness. Why? We'll talk about that this morning.
[time=1625] Second question is this. I'll swim your notes. What can we learn? What can we learn from the Corinthians to be thankful ourselves
[time=1634] and encourage thanksgiving in others? The Corinthians clearly had done this. They had done something so amazing that others were prompted to praise God to be thankful.
[time=1646] There is no greater gift that you can give somebody else. Please hear me.
[time=1652] There is no greater gift you can give somebody else this holiday season than the gift of prompting joy, worship and thankfulness in their hearts.
[time=1664] In this morning, we're talking a little bit about that. What was it about this whole thing that took place, this story that happened that prompted this reaction?
[time=1673] Would you all please stand with me and we'll read the first five verses of 2 Corinthians 9. They will be on the screens in front of you behind me.
[time=1681] I'm so grateful to be together this morning. 2 Corinthians 9, just the first five verses to start this morning.
[time=1686] Now, it is superfluous for me to write to you about the ministry of the saints.
[time=1694] For I know your readiness of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year, and your zeal has stirred up most of them.
[time=1706] But I'm saying the brothers that are boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter, that you may be ready, as I said you would be.
[time=1715] Otherwise, if the Macedonians come with me and find that you're not ready, we'd be humiliated. So nothing of you for being so confident.
[time=1722] So, I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the gift you've promised, that it may be ready as a willing gift, not as an exaction you may be seated.
[time=1738] So the first thing that we see in the Corinthians that prompted the Jerusalem church to be thankful was Roman number one in your notes, it's readiness.
[time=1748] They were ready, and Paul says they were ready, and he, in fact, encourages them to be ready when he shows up, so they won't be embarrassed, which I think is appropriate.
[time=1758] Paul is so confident that they're going to respond in the right way that he says, "I have no need to even write to you. My writing to you is superfluous." That word means it's not even necessary for me to write, although he still does.
[time=1771] Oh, by the way, let's keep that in front. He knows verse two of their eagerness to help. The word readiness may be in your translation reading this morning says eagerness to help.
[time=1782] Same word. Readiness is eagerness, more on this to come later on. In verse two, he mentions two places, FYI.
[time=1791] Macedonia is northern Greece, and Achaia is southern Greece. What do I mention it? So what? These are real places.
[time=1799] These are real people that responded in real ways to real people's needs in desperate times, and all these things welled up inside of them, friends. That's important to settle into and to recognize.
[time=1811] Real people living in real places, meeting the real needs of other people, so I encourage you with that this morning.
[time=1819] Look at verse three. Paul says, "I'm starting to brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter.
[time=1831] I was talking to my friend, Jim Posey, recently about his daughter, who's going to be flying helicopter.
[time=1838] She's working her way through West Point, and he's proud and anxious, a little bit too, I think it's fair to say.
[time=1846] But it would be appropriate for Jim to talk to me about how proud he is of his daughter, Liz. That's appropriate.
[time=1852] This is a boasting like a father about a child. I'm so proud of my kids, of what they're accomplishing, of the people that they're becoming.
[time=1862] That's appropriate. Paul's boasting is not in vain. Paul's boasting isn't, "Hey, check these guys out. He's boasting like a proud parent.
[time=1869] That's a good thing. Would you be the cause of somebody else's righteous boasting this holiday season? Did you hear what they did? Praise God."
[time=1877] Would you put that out ahead of yourself as a goal, as a mindset this season? What a great thing to think about.
[time=1883] There's all these good intentions that the people of Corinth have, but if those good intentions aren't met with real action, it's going to lead to problems.
[time=1895] And so with you, God is not going to judge me, friends, based on my intentions. Can I repeat that to you?
[time=1903] God is not going to judge us. I'll leave you out of it. I'll put us all in the same bill, rather. He's not going to judge us based on what we wish we had done, what we would have liked to have done, but what we've actually done.
[time=1915] And people who are in need don't need your good intentions or mine. They need your help. It could be money and it could be time, but whatever it is they need you.
[time=1923] And Paul makes that very clear to the Corinthians that good intentions are not enough. I know you mean well. He says, that's great. Do something.
[time=1934] This is the time to do something for them. And they did praise God. 2 Timothy 4 reminds me of this readiness. 2 Timothy 4 verses 1 and 2.
[time=1945] Paul's talking to a young pastor, Timothy, and he says this, "I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom preach the Word. Be ready in season and out of season.
[time=1962] Reprove, rebuke, and exhort with complete patience and teaching. Be ready in season and out of season. Readiness is something that we should all be mindful of all the time.
[time=1975] There is a real sense, friends. Here's the point. There is a real sense the Corinthians had done, all that needed to be done to meet the needs of other people. They were ready.
[time=1986] I wonder if there are things in the way for us that make us unready to meet the needs of others. I wonder if we're careless or selfish.
[time=1998] I wonder if we are in debt or idolatrous or scared. All those things. Friends, my encouragement to you this morning, my encouragement to us is to not let those things carelessness, selfless idolatry, fear, indebtedness that's out of control to get in the way of you being helpful to somebody else.
[time=2018] The Corinthians had all those obstacles removed. Let nothing stand in the way of that, friends. That's my encouragement to you this morning. To put yourself in position to be ready when somebody has a need, there is nothing more worth our time. Look at verse 5.
[time=2033] I thought it necessary that to urge the brothers to go on ahead of you to you rather and arrange in advance for the gift you promised. It may be ready as a willing gift. That is an exaction.
[time=2043] By the way, young people in the room this morning quickly, bonus coverage. When you say you're going to be somewhere or you're going to do something, be there and do it.
[time=2054] The most important thing you can have as part of your integrity is that you keep your word. If you say you will be there to your parents, be there. Be home by 11. Be home by 11.
[time=2064] Be a person that has integrity. That's a challenge to you that someone else ordered me told me once and it's meant a lot. I encourage you with that this morning.
[time=2072] Friends, this verse 5 is a willing gift. It's not a gift given that was given grudgingly or a gift. Okay, here you go. That word "exaction" there in verse 5, it means something you're not forced to do. There's no heavy handedness here. There's a need. You guys need to meet it. Go. Meet it.
[time=2094] Look at Ephesians chapter 6 verses 14 and 15. This is great. Ephesians 6, 14 says, "Stand therefore having fastened on the belt of truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and as shoes for your feet watch, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace." There is a sense that the gospel makes you ready in that translation. It's an amazing verse.
[time=2119] Let your feet be ready to move with the gospel. Something like that. The gospel makes you ready and it makes you think about other people and the needs that you have admitted in you that you can now meet in other people. Isn't that great? What an amazing picture of warning to bring good news.
[time=2136] The first thing friends that we see in them, that we can cultivate in ourselves is readiness. Be ready. Number two in your notes is generosity. Readiness and generosity.
[time=2149] Second Corinthians, whether 9 verse 6 is a preacher's dream, he gives you the main point right here. Here it is. The point is this. Wow, that's great.
[time=2157] Whoever sows sparingly, here it is, will also reap sparingly and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. I want to pause for a second and be very, very clear.
[time=2171] Paul is not saying if you give a lot, you will get a lot financially. That's a very dangerous thing to do and I'm going to be very careful to say something other than that this morning because there can be a lot of real confusion on this front.
[time=2186] Here's what he is saying. Look at verse 10. He use supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness, not your stuff.
[time=2204] God knows that what you need and what I need is righteousness, not stuff. And God forgive us for the culture that we cultivate.
[time=2214] For Black Friday, all the days following after it that are like it, we just need, you have, you never have enough.
[time=2220] Heck yeah, I said to the people, you eat, you put your stuff in bags of holes in it. Forgive us God. For our distractions.
[time=2229] We are given much to give much friends and I am so grateful for the example that you have served as a church for years in this regard.
[time=2237] At least with Corbin and Tanya, at the least of which with them, but many other examples as well. I thank God for you the way God, the way that Paul thank God for the Corinthians.
[time=2246] I'm so grateful for you this morning and I want you to know that. You're an example to me and to my family. To get a lot here does not mean material possessions.
[time=2254] It means that you are blessed to be a blessing. That's the message of 2 Corinthians 9 verse 6. Look at verse 7.
[time=2262] Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion because you have to. God loves a cheerful giver.
[time=2271] So, Kelly, a few weeks ago, talked about giving and New Testament principles with regard to giving. And here they are again. Paul is revisiting them.
[time=2278] And here are just five words asking just to jot down by wave review because we forget. I forget to. Five words to jot down about giving.
[time=2286] Are you ready? Here we go. Same twice. Willing. Our giving should be willing. Regular. Proportionate. You can abbreviate. Generous and sacrificial.
[time=2301] These are five words that the New Testament lays out for us in terms of how we should give our money and our time.
[time=2307] It should be willing. Regular. Proportionate. Generous. Sacrificial. Steve. What does that mean? I don't know. The Holy Spirit does a good job.
[time=2318] I'm not going to do his job for him. He leaves it open to you and says be those things. And I know that you will.
[time=2326] There's no heavy handedness. There's no coercion. There's just the Holy Spirit saying you should do this.
[time=2331] And I am so grateful again that many of you do and that you will and that you have. So grateful for you.
[time=2338] Take a moment. Fasten your seat belts. Look at verse eight. Look at this. And God is able.
[time=2348] We've seen that song often around this place and we're not going to stop. God is able to make all grace abound to you.
[time=2358] Friends, he's still able to do it this morning. On December 1st, 2013, he is still able to make grace abound to you.
[time=2366] He is able. He has never stopped being able. But wait. There's more.
[time=2371] So that having all sufficiency in all things at all times.
[time=2378] This is the promise of the provision of God. All sufficiency in all things at all times.
[time=2385] Can you comprehend what a great blessing that is? Are you there? All sufficiency in all things at all times.
[time=2393] Praise God. God isn't dealing out to us dollar bills. God is lavishing his grace on us day after day after day.
[time=2404] How could we not sing about the glories of his righteousness? Wow.
[time=2413] Giving to those in need, friends, with expectation that you will be financially rewarded is gutting the heart of the gospel.
[time=2422] It's because the gospel is about giving with no expectation of return.
[time=2427] So Christ says in Luke chapter 6, very clearly, he says, love your enemies, do good to them, lend to them without expecting to be repaid.
[time=2436] Then your reward in heaven will be very great. Your reward in heaven will be great. Not down here.
[time=2442] All sufficiency friends in verse 8 is this remarkable picture of contentment.
[time=2447] There is nothing better. Godliness with contentment is great game. What a great message for the season of the year, isn't it?
[time=2456] We sing a song run here we have for years by Chris Tomlin called Enough. And here are the words.
[time=2463] All of you is more than enough for all of me, for every thirst and every need.
[time=2470] You satisfy me with your love and all I have in you is more than enough.
[time=2474] You are my supply, my breath of life still more awesome than I know.
[time=2479] You are my reward worth living for and still more awesome than I know. Amen?
[time=2486] Still more awesome than I know. He still is.
[time=2490] Ephesians 1 and verse 8 says, I just mentioned, that God has lavished His grace on us.
[time=2499] There is a picture there that God wants us to join. You are going to have a chance in a few minutes to join in this picture of great generosity.
[time=2506] God hasn't, again, given His grace in small measure, He is lavishing it out on His children.
[time=2512] And I know that I need it every single hour of every single day.
[time=2518] Our giving should be generous because God has been incredibly generous with us. Amen?
[time=2524] We have been enriched in every way to be generous in every way.
[time=2529] Verse 11 says that, if you've been blessed with lots of financial resources, God's perspective on them is that you are a steward, not an owner, of any one of us.
[time=2542] That's His picture of our relationship with those resources, rich or poor, whatever we have.
[time=2549] What a beautiful picture, be generous because God is generous.
[time=2553] And the generosity of the Corinthians, they were generous, prompted Thanksgiving.
[time=2558] Third, in your notes, service, service, service, prompts, thanksgiving, it prompts worship, it prompts rejoicing.
[time=2568] We got letters back from people that, when you went to their houses and raked their leaves, it's not a big deal, friends.
[time=2573] It's a few hours on a Saturday morning, but it meant the world to them.
[time=2576] They're looking forward to it for days on end.
[time=2579] And thank you for your service, if you came to be involved in the big serve, thank you for what you did.
[time=2584] This gift that they gave, it says, was overflowing with many thanksgivings to God.
[time=2590] This is a quote from a book called "The Galilean Accent" by a man named A.J. Gossop, and it's great.
[time=2596] I think he's really on to something here about thanksgiving.
[time=2599] He said, "Thanksgiving is the language of heaven, and we better start to learn it if we are not to be mere dumb aliens.
[time=2608] Read Revelation, read those songs, blessing, and honor, and glory, and power.
[time=2613] And thanks be unto God forever and ever.
[time=2617] Thanksgiving is the language of heaven." What an amazing verse that is.
[time=2623] In Matthew 5, Jesus says this about my good deeds and yours.
[time=2628] You, Matthew 5, 14, you are the light of the world.
[time=2633] A city on a hill cannot be hidden.
[time=2636] Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house in the same way.
[time=2644] What your light shined before others, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
[time=2651] It's not that we do good works, and God loves us.
[time=2654] It's that God loves us, and we do good works.
[time=2657] That's the economy of God.
[time=2658] I'll say it again, for emphasis.
[time=2660] It is not that we do good works, and God says, "Okay, I sure like that a lot." God loves us, and we respond with good works.
[time=2669] People see that and say, "Praise God, praise God.
[time=2673] God is among you, surely God is among you." The Corinthians express the genuine nature of their faith by the obedience that comes from their confession of faith.
[time=2685] Look at verse 12.
[time=2689] The ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God.
[time=2697] Wow, what a beautiful picture.
[time=2699] Lastly, this morning, number four, in your notes.
[time=2703] Readiness is number one, number two, generosity, number three service.
[time=2708] All these things, prompted thanksgiving.
[time=2710] We can learn from their example, and number four is grace.
[time=2714] The grace of God.
[time=2718] We'll read verse 13 in the new living translation. It's helpful.
[time=2722] As a result of your ministry, they will give glory to God for your generosity to them, and to all believers will prove that you are obedient to the good news of Christ.
[time=2733] Friends, we have James.
[time=2735] You say you believe in God? Great.
[time=2737] Even the demons believe in shudder.
[time=2740] Show me your faith by what you do. James challenges them.
[time=2743] Verse 14, "While they long for you, and pray for you because of the surpassing grace, the overflowing grace, the extraordinary grace of God."
[time=2755] His amazing grace, the grace of God produces longing and closeness in God's family.
[time=2762] If you know how much you have received God's grace, how much you need God's grace,
[time=2769] you'll be quick to give it to other people.
[time=2772] I'll repeat myself.
[time=2774] Those who have received God's grace and know their great need of it will be quick to give it to other people.
[time=2781] So friends, don't forget about the grace of God in your life. Don't forget.
[time=2784] I know that we all do sometimes.
[time=2787] It's a great danger we all have to fight through.
[time=2792] Edward Pusi in the letter a long time ago wrote these words about thanksgiving.
[time=2799] "Do not," he says, "of course, any of us, nearly thank God enough.
[time=2804] I fear that what will surprise us most when we see our Lord will be the extent of our own ingratitude."
[time=2812] I think he's right. I think he's right because of verse 15 of 2 Corinthians 9.
[time=2820] I think we adequately say thank you for an indescribable gift, an inexpressible gift.
[time=2831] John 3 16 is perhaps the most familiar verse in the whole Bible.
[time=2836] And I've been teaching Christian schools for a long time, and the "yeah, yeah, yeah" syndrome sets in.
[time=2842] I've heard it all before, right? Sure.
[time=2845] And I think sometimes we tend to skip over what's familiar, and we do so at great danger to our souls.
[time=2851] So can I read John 3 16 again with you?
[time=2854] "For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."
[time=2865] An inexpressible gift, undescribable gift, amazing.
[time=2870] Ephesians 2, familiar words to many of us, "For by grace you have been saved through faith."
[time=2876] This is not your own doing. It's the gift of God.
[time=2879] Not as a result of works that no one may boast, for we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.
[time=2891] An indescribable gift. I want to do something this morning as we close.
[time=2895] I'm going to read that verse, that last verse, verse 15, out loud with you together three times.
[time=2903] I want you to say it to those listening at home can hear you, okay?
[time=2907] 2 Corinthians 9, 15, we're going to say it in unison, out loud together,
[time=2913] because the indescribable gift, friends, the inexpressible gift as we're going to say, as the band makes their way up on the stage, the inexpressible gift is Jesus.
[time=2923] What more could we do to speak those words out to them?
[time=2928] That's the currency that we have is our words.
[time=2933] So this morning, as we close, as we get ready to sing again, would you say this with me?
[time=2938] 2 Corinthians 9, 15, out loud with gusto three times.
[time=2944] You ready? Here we go.
[time=2946] Thanks be to God for His inexpressible gift. Thanks be to God for His inexpressible gift.
[time=2954] Thanks be to God for His inexpressible gift.
[time=2962] Heavenly Father, words fail, but you have asked us to respond.
[time=2971] So God, may we do it.
[time=2975] May we offer sacrifices of praise to you this morning.
[time=2980] And as we stand to sing, may you be pleased with what you hear.
[time=2984] We pray all these things in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=2988] Would you stand to sing together this morning?
