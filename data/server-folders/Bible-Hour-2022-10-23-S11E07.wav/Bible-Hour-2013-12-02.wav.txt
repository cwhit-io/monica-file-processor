[time=41] I'm so grateful that it's December and I am so thankful that we can begin to say more and more so as this month unwinds, Merry Christmas.
[time=51] Merry Christmas at a time of year when we get to celebrate the greatest gift and the greatest story ever given or ever told.
[time=58] It is a time of year when we as believers get to truly and genuinely celebrate all that God has done for us through the person and work of his son, Jesus Christ.
[time=70] And at Black Hawk, we give the entire month, all of December.

[time=143] It's going to be a great night, always is, as we remember the sacrifice of our Lord through communion, as we sing classic Christmas songs together, and as we enjoy some fellowship that night, that night of all nights when our Lord and Savior came.
[time=158] So be with us, the 15th to 22nd, the 24th Christmas Eve. I can't wait to see what God's going to do as we gather together to celebrate the great gift.
[time=169] Hey, thank you for tuning in. Thank you so much for your faithful support and your part in this family. We love you, and as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=647] [MUSIC - 346 seconds]
[time=997] God, we just want to say today that that is true that you are those things. You are greater. You're stronger. Of all the things that we could choose to worship in this world, God. You are at the top. Without question, without deviation, you are the top.
[time=1017] God, we thank you for an opportunity just to stand before you. To lift our voices, to lift our hearts.
[time=1025] And to bring to you things that honestly, you don't need from us. You don't need our affirmation of who you are. You don't need our adoration. You don't need our praise.
[time=1041] Like God, it's what we can do just to acknowledge who you are.
[time=1047] We pray that you would accept our offering this morning of praise in God and that would make your heart happy. And amen.
[time=1055] [MUSIC - 36 seconds]
[time=1095] When was it? Let me ask you this. I want you to personally think about this. When was it? Where were you? What was going on in your life? That time in your life when you needed, when you really needed and experienced first hand.
[time=1114] The kindness, the grace, the goodness of God. You needed a faithful God to faithfully in your circumstance make a way. And he did. Where were you? What was going on? What had transpired? What were you up against? What were you facing?
[time=1139] This morning, just like the Israelites in Joshua 4. And if you've got your scriptures with you this morning, if you're looking at the Word of God on a tablet or phone or get your Bible right in front of you either way, open to, if you would to Joshua chapter 4. And this morning, just like the Israelites.
[time=1156] In Joshua chapter 4, we want to give you the opportunity to look back. Oh, come let us adore him.
[time=1166] We want to give you the chance this morning to look back at the faithfulness of God. The faithfulness of God. When the power of God and the goodness of God showed up in your life.
[time=1179] Look with me at Joshua 4. I'm going to begin reading it, verse 1. Some of you know the story. Others of you don't. The people of Israel. God has been guiding them. God has been leading them from the beginning of their journey.
[time=1193] It was all about his direction for them as he led them to the what? As he led them to the promised what? Land. So he's leading the people to the promised land. They're doing well. They're doing not so well.
[time=1206] It's quite a journey, quite a story. But here they are. They're really close. And they're almost to where they're supposed to be. And they come upon this thing called the Jordan River.
[time=1220] And it says here in Joshua 4 now when all the nation had finished crossing the Jordan. The Lord spoke to Joshua saying, "Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe, and command them saying, 'Take up for yourselves twelve stones from here out of the middle of the Jordan from the place where the priests' feet are standing firm and carry them these rocks.
[time=1249] Over with you and lay them down in the lodging place where you will lodge tonight." So Joshua 4 called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the sons of Israel, one man from each tribe. And Joshua said to them, "Cross again to the ark of the Lord your God, into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you take up a stone on his shoulder." According to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,
[time=1276] let this be a sign among you so that when your children ask later, and please remember church children always ask later,
[time=1290] saying, "Mom, Dad, what do these stones mean to you? Then you shall say to them, because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord."
[time=1305] When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off, so these stones shall become a memorial, a proclamation, a symbol to the sons of Israel forever.
[time=1321] If you go back to chapter 3, do that real quick, chapter 3, verse 15, and when those who carried the ark came into the Jordan and the feet of the priests carrying the ark were dipped in the edge of the water, we oftentimes think about,
[time=1338] remember, as we should, the Red Sea, and all that happened with the people of Israel, as Pharaoh's army is bearing in, sometimes we forget about what happened here at the Jordan, when their feet dipped in the edge of the water, for the Jordan overflows all its banks, all the days of harvest.
[time=1357] This was a large, strong, full, rushing river. The waters, verse 16, the waters which were flowing down from above, stood and rose up in one heap.
[time=1372] The entire nation of Israel and the ark of the covenant have to get to the promised land.
[time=1380] They have to get across the Jordan River, and I want to just say this to you this morning, all of you, all of you have been there.
[time=1390] All of you have been in this spot.
[time=1395] You know you want to go forward.
[time=1404] You know that God has called you, you know that God has commanded you, you know God and His Word and His Spirit are clearly indicating to you that that right there, that is where you need to be, that that is what you need to do.
[time=1423] But there's this river in front of you.
[time=1428] There is this circumstance, this physical reality, whatever it is, it seems insurmountable, it seems ominous, it seems huge, it seems like there's absolutely no way through.
[time=1443] It's overwhelming.
[time=1446] What am I going to do? What are we going to do?
[time=1449] There's a river.
[time=1451] For God intervenes, God intervenes, God in His time and place stopped a river completely.
[time=1466] This morning adoring Him, adoring the Lord for the ways in which He has shown His faithfulness to you.
[time=1476] I think many of you in this room can stop and ponder your relationship with Him in recent weeks, recent months, maybe even years, and you can begin to even now as we speak, think back on those times when He stopped some rivers in your life.
[time=1494] Sometimes when He stepped into your circumstance and did something far beyond anything, you could ever ask or think.
[time=1503] We're going to give you the opportunity this morning here in just a few minutes to make a memorial, like the Israelites did, to actually hear this morning create a physical representation, a physical marker that will remind you of and proclaim how your God showed up for you at a time when God stepped into your circumstance
[time=1530] and delivered you, rescued you, when He encouraged you a time when the river stopped, a time when He exercised His power on your behalf.
[time=1540] I want us to adore Him this morning as we consider His faithfulness in the past.
[time=1546] I want us to celebrate that this morning.
[time=1549] Before we go any further though, I want to keep reading here just a couple of verses because I love what Joshua did. Joshua did what God said to do. They got the stones out in the middle of the river and took them to the lodging place.
[time=1560] Well, let me read the verse 8, verse 8 and 9 from Joshua 4. Thus the sons of Israel did as Joshua commanded and took up 12 stones from the middle of the Jordan just as the Lord spoke to Joshua according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
[time=1576] And they carried them over with them to the lodging place and put them down there.
[time=1581] Then, I love this, then Joshua set up 12 stones in the middle of the Jordan at the very place, at the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant were standing.
[time=1598] And they are there, those rocks, that memorial, it says they are there to this day.
[time=1606] Joshua said right here, right now in this very place where God showed up in His faithful good and gracious way, we are going to erect a memorial, a physical structure that speaks to not only our gratitude, but the faithfulness of God.
[time=1626] So, I want to give you the chance this morning. We want to see each and every one of you that are willing come and do that very thing and we'll explain that to you in a moment.
[time=1636] But first, let me just say this. Let me remind us of just a couple of things. I think it's important for our thinking. I think it's important for our theology.
[time=1645] We have a theology. I don't know if you knew that. You and I have a theology. We have a thinking. We have an understanding of truth when it comes to God and His attributes and how He works.
[time=1655] And on this issue of God's blessing, on this issue of God's faithfulness, on this topic of God intervening and doing great things, it's interesting, there's a lot of different theologies about that.
[time=1671] There's a lot of different ways people view that. And I want to just remind us as a family, just take a few minutes here and make sure that we're clear on a couple of things as to how I believe this works and why it is that we can be so thankful.
[time=1688] When you hear people talk about this issue of God's faithfulness, there's a couple of things that are very important for you to keep in mind.
[time=1701] God doesn't, and I want to just give you two things here. God doesn't exercise His goodness and His grace. God doesn't exercise deliverance, and I hope you'll write these down.
[time=1712] God doesn't exercise deliverance for us, the changing of circumstances, the intervention from above. He doesn't exercise His goodness and grace because number one, we deserve it.
[time=1724] And I want to make sure you understand this. There's two things I want you to see. Number one, people oftentimes think that He does this because they deserve it.
[time=1732] Please remember, please keep this in mind, God's blessing, His faithfulness, His deliverance isn't fundamentally tied to your current grade.
[time=1747] This isn't fundamentally tied to how good you are, or quite honestly how bad you're doing. The truth of the matter is I've seen both A pluses and D minuses rescued.
[time=1762] I've seen the goodness and the faithfulness of God delivered to people all across the spectrum. And more important even than the grades is this, if you want to talk about what we deserve,
[time=1775] I mean, if you really want to get into a discussion of what it is you and I deserve as it relates to God, if we want to talk about your life and my life and we want to talk about your heart and soul and mind, if we want to talk about left to ourselves, what we deserve,
[time=1790] from a holy and righteous God, you and me left to ourselves, you and me left in our humanness, you and me left to our own merits, we don't deserve, believe me.
[time=1800] Scripture is very clear, we don't deserve rescue and deliverance, we deserve judgment and condemnation. Look at Romans 1, just real quick, if you turn back in your New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, and then you come to the book of Romans.
[time=1818] In Romans 1 verse 22 it says this, talking about mankind, talking about you, talking about me, talking about us left to ourselves, what are we really like, what is the reality of our hearts and minds and souls left to ourselves.
[time=1834] It says in 1.22, professing to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God, traded the glory of God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four footed animals and crawling creatures.
[time=1852] The man left to himself trades God for a little statue, therefore God gave them over it says, and the lusts of their hearts to impurity so that their bodies would be dishonored among them, for they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, that's what we do.
[time=1868] We exchange the truth of God for a lie, says in verse 28 and just as they did not see fit mankind left to themselves, just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, that's who we are.
[time=1886] In our humanness to do those things which are not proper, being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice, they are men left to themselves, gossip, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful.
[time=1912] And although they know the ordinances of God that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same things but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.
[time=1924] Left to ourselves. What do we deserve? Left to ourselves. What are we like in our humanness?
[time=1930] How do we match up to the goodness of God? It says in Romans 3 verse 11 verse 10, it says there is none righteous, not even one. There is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks for God.
[time=1943] Really, left to themselves all have turned aside. Together they have become useless. There is none who does good. There's not even one.
[time=1954] Romans 3, 13, their throat is an open grave with their tongues. They keep deceiving. The poison of asps is under their lips.
[time=1963] Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift as shed blood, destruction and misery are in their paths and the path of peace they have not known.
[time=1973] There is no fear of God before their eyes. Romans 5 verses 6 through 10, that passage calls us helpless, ungodly sinners and enemies.
[time=1987] We were helpless, we were ungodly, we were left to ourselves sinners and at enmity with God, enemies of God. This is who we are, left to ourselves.
[time=1999] And if you want to, I would think maybe it wouldn't be productive, but if you want to talk about what you deserve, don't ever forget.
[time=2011] And I don't mean this to discourage you, I don't mean this to in any way beat you down, let me say it and then please let me finish.
[time=2018] Please don't ever forget what you are at the core of your sinful human self. You are that bad. I am that depraved.
[time=2029] We are left to ourselves in that much trouble, but don't ever forget those of you who can say this in the room today.
[time=2040] Don't ever forget that when you fully surrendered your heart and life to the Lord Jesus Christ, don't ever forget that the love of God and the grace of God and the power of God transformed you.
[time=2053] And made you new, made you different, made you a new creature, a new being.
[time=2059] So, listen, so his deliverance, his goodness, his grace isn't exercised toward us because we deserve it.
[time=2069] It's exercised because he's just so gracious. And secondly, look at this, blessing and goodness and grace don't come because blessing is always best.
[time=2079] You'll hear this, I hear it often, you'll hear people talking as if in this conversation there's this understood reality, this understood truth, that blessing is always best and that God is always about blessing.
[time=2094] And I want to just make sure you're clear on this, he doesn't always stop the river, does he?
[time=2101] In your circumstance, in mind, he doesn't always part the waters.
[time=2107] God is not of the mindset that blessing or rescue is always the best option.
[time=2112] He doesn't always deliver if by deliver you mean the change of your circumstance for the better as perceived by you.
[time=2119] Ask Jeremiah about that.
[time=2122] Ask Job about that.
[time=2125] Ask Jesus about that.
[time=2132] Ask the millions, the countless millions of believers over the centuries whose difficult circumstance got worse.
[time=2144] You see, it's not always health, wealth, and prosperity as defined by our culture or this world.
[time=2154] It sometimes isn't health.
[time=2158] Sometimes it isn't wealth.
[time=2162] Sometimes it's not prosperity.
[time=2166] So you're sitting there this morning and you're thinking with me, if it's not, how does the rescue come?
[time=2172] How does the goodness and faithfulness of God make its way to me?
[time=2175] How does this all work if it's not because I deserve it, which I don't believe we do?
[time=2180] And if it's not because blessing is always best, what is it?
[time=2184] Well, let me just read this to you and I want you to hang on to this this morning as we make our way into this phenomenal opportunity.
[time=2192] I want you to remember this.
[time=2193] God brings deliverance, write this down.
[time=2196] God does bring deliverance to us.
[time=2199] He brings it in his time for his reasons in his place.
[time=2207] God brings deliverance to us in his time for his reasons in his place.
[time=2215] Somebody said to me that makes it sound like God's just arbitrary.
[time=2220] He's just like flipping a coin.
[time=2223] And I want to make sure you understand he's not arbitrary.
[time=2226] He's sovereign.
[time=2228] That doesn't give indication to some arbitrariness.
[time=2232] It gives indication of the providence with which he deals with you and me.
[time=2239] His plan, his place, his reasons, reasons that most of the time you and I can't even fathom.
[time=2246] He brings deliverance to us, yes, he does in his time for his reasons in his place because he's deeply committed to our growth.
[time=2254] And sometimes what the people of Israel needed is they needed for the water to stop.
[time=2261] And sometimes what the people of Israel needed and sometimes what you needed is to wander for 40 years going where in the world are you.
[time=2272] Sometimes it's not always blessing, but he's always committed to your growth.
[time=2278] And in whatever he chooses, whether to stop the water and take you across to a new day or whether it's to just have you hang in there, he gets glorified.
[time=2292] He gets glorified because the whole nation went across the river.
[time=2296] You know what? He gets glorified in your suffering because he's who you hang on to.
[time=2302] And he is who sustains you and he is who gets you through.
[time=2307] So either way, either way, God brings deliverance to us in his time and his place because he's deeply committed to our growth and his glory.
[time=2320] You love and it fails and never gives up, never runs out on me.
[time=2350] Higher and it's higher than the mountains that I face, and it's stronger than the power of the race.
[time=2369] And it's constant in the trial and the change, it's the one thing we made, it's one thing, it's one thing we made, it's a higher than the mountains.
[time=2389] And it's higher than the mountains that I face, and it's stronger than the power of the race.
[time=2403] And it's constant in the trial and the change, it's the one thing we made, it's one thing.
[time=2420] You love and it fails and never gives up, never runs out on me.
[time=2450] And only, only, only, only, only goes.
[time=2456] It's the old world that satisfies my soul.
[time=2463] And I'll never, ever have to be afraid.
[time=2469] This one thing we made, it's one thing, it's one thing we made.
[time=2482] You love never fails and never gives up, never runs out on me.
[time=2552] You love never runs out on me.
[time=2556] You love and it fails and never runs out on me.
[time=2663] Hey, I want to say this before you sit down and we move on.
[time=2667] I bumped into three people this morning just literally just saying hello and in hello conversations
[time=2675] found three people who are today like just in the last 48 hours facing new rivers, new
[time=2684] circumstances that are really hard and discouraging and difficult.
[time=2690] And I saw those people and I watched others of you come and leave your rocks.
[time=2696] Because that's how it works.
[time=2699] We go through things and he's faithful, teaches us and he grows us and we leave a rock.
[time=2706] And sometimes it feels like no sooner do we go back and sit down and all of a sudden bam,
[time=2712] new river.
[time=2713] What am I going to do?
[time=2716] And I want to just remind you of this.
[time=2718] When they crossed the Jordan and they got to the other side and the water started flowing,
[time=2725] Joshua got back in front and said let's go.
[time=2729] They turned around and they began to march and what was in front of them.
[time=2735] Jericho, the enemy, insurmountable, impossible.
[time=2745] And you and I both know many of them fought.
[time=2748] No, no, not impossible.
[time=2754] He just stopped the river.
[time=2758] You just put a stone down.
[time=2761] So you and I are going to leave this place today in a little bit and there's going to be another river.
[time=2766] And we have a faithful God who will in his time and place for your growth and his glory.
[time=2771] He'll figure it out.
[time=2773] [AMEN - 1 seconds] Have a seat.
[time=2776] If you would please I want to invite Corbin and Tanya Miller.
[time=2778] I'd love for their kids.
[time=2779] I would love for their families.
[time=2781] Any of their family who are here, love for all of our elders in the room.
[time=2785] Any of our staff members would love for you all to come up on stage.
[time=2789] We are sending.
[time=2791] We are commissioning this family today.
[time=2794] Many of you know Corbin and Tanya have served here in our church for almost 12 years.
[time=2798] They have led us.
[time=2800] They have cared for us.
[time=2802] They have used their gifts of arts and music and production to move the kingdom forward right
[time=2810] here in a powerful way.
[time=2812] And God has clearly, and those of us who have walked with them, we know this.
[time=2818] He has clearly called them in this season to a new place and a new opportunity.
[time=2826] They leave tomorrow for Poland and an assignment with Josiah Venture, a tremendous ministry
[time=2833] family.
[time=2834] They're headed to Poland to give themselves to young people and youth and students in that country, they're going to use their gifts with art and music and choir and leading and discipling to make a difference in a place far, far away.
[time=2848] And I wanted to just take a moment this morning.
[time=2850] I want us to be able to, as a family, send them.
[time=2855] We want to pray for them.
[time=2856] And I want it to just before we do that, I want to read to them.
[time=2861] And I want to read to all of us a passage that may be familiar to many of you.
[time=2868] But I think in some ways this morning it takes on a whole new, a whole new sense of truth
[time=2874] and direction.
[time=2875] It says in Matthew 28, as Jesus stood there, freshly resurrected on his way to be with the
[time=2881] Father, leaving those twelve.
[time=2885] And they represent you and me.
[time=2888] Those twelve represent the millers.
[time=2891] He's going, but he's leaving others to do the one thing that mattered most to him.
[time=2896] And so he says to them, he says, Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority,
[time=2902] all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth." And so as I said to you guys first hour, I'll say it to you again, don't be afraid.
[time=2911] Don't be afraid.
[time=2913] All authority has been given.
[time=2916] All power and protection, the ability to oversee has been given to the one who loves you and
[time=2922] cares for you and is sending you.
[time=2925] Don't be afraid.
[time=2926] And don't you be afraid for them.
[time=2928] It's all right.
[time=2930] The one in authority is sending them.
[time=2934] He says, go there for.
[time=2936] Go.
[time=2937] He says, leave.
[time=2940] Leave this mountain.
[time=2942] Go away.
[time=2943] Don't stay here.
[time=2945] Go somewhere else, he says, to them.
[time=2948] Because somewhere else needs what you've been given.
[time=2952] He says, go there for, make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the
[time=2958] Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you.
[time=2966] And lo, somebody asked me what lo meant.
[time=2971] And I said, I think it means, hey.
[time=2975] Hey, listen up.
[time=2977] Hey, I am with you.
[time=2981] Always.
[time=2983] There's no place you can go.
[time=2985] There's nothing you'll ever face.
[time=2987] There's no new challenge, no new place, no new people, no new anything that could ever, ever disturb what I'm about with you.
[time=2998] So understand, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=3004] All friends, I want you to know, as a friend to them, as one who had the privilege of working
[time=3010] with them and alongside them, in this process, they were from the very beginning.
[time=3015] They were as kids when they first showed up.
[time=3019] My gosh, you're still kids.
[time=3022] So they were from the very beginning.
[time=3024] They were open.
[time=3025] Please hear this.
[time=3026] This should be an encouragement to you.
[time=3028] They've modeled something here.
[time=3029] I want to make sure you understand.
[time=3030] They have been from the beginning.
[time=3032] The day they showed up, they've been open.
[time=3036] Hands up, no clenched fists.
[time=3040] God, what do you want to do with us?
[time=3043] We'll be here for as long as you want us here.
[time=3045] We'll do all that you ask us to do, but from day one, they've been open.
[time=3050] They've also been engaged.
[time=3052] It's one thing to be open, and they kind of go hide in a corner.
[time=3055] But no, they went new places, and they tried new things, and they took on new assignments, and they stretched themselves, and you should too.
[time=3062] I wonder what God has for you.
[time=3066] I would never have guessed this for them 12 years ago, but they were open, and they were engaged, and you know what?
[time=3072] They listened, and I want to just tell you that.
[time=3075] They listened to what God said, and as God spoke all along the way, they obeyed.
[time=3080] In personal heartache, in ministry challenges, in future decisions, they listened, and they did what
[time=3088] God called them to do.
[time=3090] They obeyed.
[time=3091] And so I'm going to ask Bill Archer if he would come, and I'm going to read this.
[time=3096] This bill's going to give this to them.
[time=3098] We'll get Bill a microphone, and let me read this to you.
[time=3102] This is what we're giving them this morning.
[time=3104] Would you all stand?
[time=3105] And let me just read this commissioning certificate.
[time=3108] We're the family of Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=3111] That's you.
[time=3113] A Fort Wayne, Indiana, hereby commissioned Corbin and Tanya Miller.
[time=3117] We believe that God has uniquely called and gifted Corbin and Tanya Miller and their family
[time=3123] for this work, and we commend them to the worldwide ministry of spreading the gospel of Jesus
[time=3130] Christ.
[time=3131] We pray that God will bless their service, presented by Blackhawk Ministries, December 8, 2013.
[time=3139] I'll give that to you.
[time=3142] Would all of you that are up here on stage, yeah, you can say amen.
[time=3150] I want to ask, if all of you up here would just put your hands on Corbin and Tanya, and
[time=3156] would all of you extend your hands toward the stage as Bill Archer, one of our elders and the leader of our global ministry's team, prays for them this morning?
[time=3165] Father, it is such a privilege to be here this morning gathered with those of like precious
[time=3174] faith to commission Corbin and Tanya through this new work.
[time=3180] Lord, it's a bittersweet experience.
[time=3183] It's a time that we look at in their sorrow because we have so enjoyed their ministry,
[time=3191] their gifts, their talents, their service, their attitude, their spirit.
[time=3197] Lord, we are just so blessed and we thank you for that time, and we sorrow because it
[time=3204] is moving on.
[time=3208] And so Lord, it is with great sweetness that we look ahead.
[time=3212] We look at the ministry that you've called M2, and we just rejoice in that.
[time=3219] We anticipate great things as you will work through them.
[time=3224] We pray, Father, that you would go before them, safety and travel.
[time=3229] We pray that there would be new friends that they have not met yet, but there would be
[time=3235] deep friends, friendships that are founded in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3241] We pray that you would bless their ministry and give them much fruit.
[time=3245] And we pray, Lord, that you would encourage them in the days ahead and may the Spirit of God give them the peace that passes understanding and the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3256] For as in His name that we pray, with thanksgiving, amen.
[time=3282] Pause in all the edge of fear, until the Son of God appears.
[time=3305] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel, shall come to thee always right now.
[time=3328] Oh, come, bow, day, spring, come and cheer our spirits by the Lamb and hear.
[time=3356] Dispers the gloomy clouds of night, and their stark shadows put to fly.
[time=3380] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel, shall come to thee always right.
[time=3410] Oh, come, these are all nations by, in one the hearts of all mankind.
[time=3433] Bend thou as the division sings, and be thyself our king of peace.
[time=3454] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel, shall come to thee always right now.
[time=3559] the Lord.
[time=3564] Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, come to thee always right now.
