[time=43] >> Mama, hello?
[time=47] You left your seat with Santa getting to the party and I followed you.
[time=51] Hello?
[time=52] >> Over here.
[time=53] >> Hey, come with me.
[time=55] I'll explain later.
[time=56] [MUSIC]
[time=66] >> We are kids on a mission and we cannot tell us all.
[time=80] Here we're at a seat, turning joy to the world.
[time=86] This must entail us in the end.
[time=97] On the cover, don't bring a word.
[time=103] On assignment, straighten these on earth.
[time=108] On the cover, bring me for your eyes.
[time=114] Activate it, come on, don't you just burn.
[time=120] >> Wait, Christmas intelligence?
[time=122] She's saying, do you spy?
[time=126] >> Agent E, do you have the situation handled?
[time=129] >> Yes, we have no choice now but to activate him.
[time=132] >> Activate me?
[time=133] >> Awesome.
[time=134] [MUSIC]
[time=136] >> On the cover, don't bring a word.
[time=142] On assignment, straighten these on earth.
[time=147] On the cover, bring me for your eyes.
[time=153] Activate it, come on, don't you just burn.
[time=158] >> With Christmas intelligence?
[time=179] [MUSIC]
[time=186] >> Thank you all for arriving promptly at our secret meeting for today's briefing.
[time=190] Obviously, you all viewed the message hidden in the candy cane you were delivered earlier today.
[time=194] >> Commander, as you can see, we had an unexpected development.
[time=200] >> I think we have all seen that Agent E.
[time=202] >> Commander, Frankie is a friend of mine from school and I assure you he is completely trustworthy.
[time=208] >> Agent, this sounds like a conversation we should be having in private, don't you think?
[time=212] >> Commander, I just created a new gadget that will solve that problem.
[time=216] Let's test out my latest creation, the super silent fruit muffs.
[time=221] Whoever wears them won't be able to hear a thing.
[time=224] >> Why, thank you Agent L.
[time=227] Are these made of fruitcake?
[time=229] >> Yes they are.
[time=231] Here you go, try these on.
[time=234] >> Commander, Frankie is a friend of mine from school and I assure you he is completely trustworthy.
[time=240] >> That is a relevant agent, he followed us here.
[time=244] >> Excuse me.
[time=248] >> Just a minute please, we'll be with you in a moment.
[time=251] >> I've done the calculations and there is a 97% chance that Frankie will be a great addition to the C.I.K.
[time=258] I had to knock off three points for his, well, slight tendency towards clumsyness.
[time=263] >> I can still hear you.
[time=266] >> Oh, I'm so sure these were going to work.
[time=269] >> Maybe they need more walnuts.
[time=271] Good news is, these things will be great for months.
[time=274] >> Agent L, now he knows even more than when he got here.
[time=278] >> Don't worry, I can fix that.
[time=280] I recently invented a memory eraser machine.
[time=283] >> Well, where is it?
[time=285] >> I tested it on myself, so I forgot where I left it.
[time=289] But I can go look for it.
[time=293] >> Very well, Agent E, I see we have no choice but to activate your friend.
[time=299] >> Your name?
[time=300] >> Frankie.
[time=301] >> Frankie, this year your codename will be Agent F.
[time=303] Welcome to the C.I.K.
[time=306] >> Sweet, what next?
[time=307] Do I get to go on a spy mission?
[time=309] Take out some bad guys?
[time=310] Can I use karate?
[time=311] >> That won't be necessary.
[time=314] Agents, please issue Agent F a hat.
[time=319] As you all know, each of our agents has to are equipped with communication devices in case we need to contact you.
[time=324] >> Like a cell phone?
[time=325] >> Yes, but it's a hat.
[time=327] >> May I have an eye hat?
[time=328] >> I found it.
[time=329] I found the memory eraser.
[time=331] I just have to adjust the trigger.
[time=336] >> Well, don't just stand there, bring it here.
[time=339] >> Bring what there?
[time=340] >> Oh, forget him.
[time=342] Let me explain.
[time=343] We spend our free time every December searching for ways to bring Christmas here to people who need it.
[time=349] And this time here, there are a lot of them out there.
[time=352] >> I gather you're all here for a reason.
[time=355] We have a new mission.
[time=358] >> Ooh, I love a good mission.
[time=361] >> Where's the memory eraser?
[time=363] >> Memory eraser.
[time=364] There's no such thing.
[time=366] Ooh, that's a great idea for an invention.
[time=370] But I do have a new gadget that would be perfect for a spy on night like this.
[time=374] >> You mean a silent night?
[time=376] >> A spy on night.
[time=378] >> Kids, why don't we explain this to Agent F?
[time=381] [MUSIC - 133 seconds]
[time=527] Now that 18F has been briefed, we have an urgent mission from a high profile client who has just retained our services.
[time=533] As you all know, we usually like to fly under the radar and seek out our own Christmas missions, but this client was particularly convincing over the phone.
[time=541] She insisted on coming in to give us the mission herself.
[time=544] Who is in charge here?
[time=546] I am. You must be Miss King.
[time=548] Agents, I'd like to introduce you to Miss Harriet King.
[time=551] Harriet. Rhymes with "parrot." I'm sorry. It's pronounced "harrot." The "I" is silent.
[time=559] Oh. King. "Hair bit." Got it. Somebody say King "Hair it." I said King "Hair it." King "Kama" "Hair it." Well, it sounded like... I know what it sounded like, but...
[time=568] Can we get on with this?
[time=570] Certainly, Miss King.
[time=572] This is a secure location.
[time=575] May I speak freely?
[time=577] Why, yes. You must speak freely in front of all of my agents.
[time=580] Agents?
[time=581] Why, these are just children.
[time=584] Yes, but they are fully trained Christmas intelligence operatives.
[time=587] So you let children into the CIA?
[time=590] Actually, for the CIA.
[time=593] Christmas intelligence. Kids.
[time=596] Oh. That's what I get for skimming the vine print, I guess.
[time=601] Now that the team has been assembled, why don't you fill us in on the details of your mission, Miss King?
[time=607] Absolutely.
[time=608] Lately, I have noticed some unusual activity at one of the many properties, iron in this town. A local warehouse.
[time=615] It seems there are shipments arriving every day.
[time=618] Brown paper packages of all shapes and sizes.
[time=621] No, naturally. I try to stay out of the affairs of my tenants, but I do need to know if anything illegal is going on.
[time=628] Commander, I could use my latest creation, the jingler.
[time=632] Pan-pending.
[time=634] Another invention. Agent L, I don't need to remind you of the...
[time=639] track record of your other inventions, do I?
[time=642] The chocolate antigravity boots.
[time=644] The cotton candy umbrella?
[time=646] Oh, no, Commander. Not this time.
[time=648] The jingler has been tested and is field ready.
[time=651] When our C.I.K. team retrieves the information from Miss King, I'll just press this button and alert you here at the base.
[time=657] Then you will know that our mission has been accomplished.
[time=660] It doesn't explode or anything, does it?
[time=665] Not so far.
[time=667] All right, agents.
[time=671] E. L. and F.
[time=675] Assemble your supplies and gather at...
[time=678] Let's see. 2,000 best of them away at 1,700 hours.
[time=682] Yes, my first mission.
[time=684] Everyone else dismissed.
[time=687] You know, we usually only accept missions that include bringing Christmas cheer to people.
[time=692] After we uncover the details that you need, we'd really like to do some special for the people there.
[time=696] Oh, if you don't mind, though.
[time=698] Oh, well, that's your business, I guess.
[time=702] I just need you to do your spy thing.
[time=705] I'll take care of the rest.
[time=707] Good, Miss King, Merry Christmas.
[time=709] Oh, uh, Merry...
[time=712] Christmas?
[time=715] Blah!
[time=716] Yes, that's the word.
[time=718] You see, it all started at, oh, so many years ago.
[time=724] When I was young, there was a toll.
[time=727] He stored down the street.
[time=734] I have a little more to myself in the monitor, please.
[time=738] Failed with fancy toys.
[time=740] Can't find anything we need.
[time=742] Did you bring your microphone?
[time=744] Didn't that much?
[time=745] So I wrote a note to Santa.
[time=749] Asking him for one thing.
[time=753] A bicycle with training wheels.
[time=756] And I waited, and I waited.
[time=761] But the present never came.
[time=764] And that was the day I knew.
[time=767] Christmas and I were through.
[time=774] I don't like tinsel.
[time=778] I don't like eggnog.
[time=780] Or an immense old mistletoe.
[time=782] Wrapping paper, falling snow, I dislike elves.
[time=785] They're kind of creamy.
[time=787] Or basil holly, and I'm not too fond to see.
[time=790] Who are dolly?
[time=791] I mean, really?
[time=793] Ho, ho, ho.
[time=794] Who's that happy?
[time=796] I don't like cool guitars.
[time=798] They annoy me just in an email, and reindeer.
[time=801] Well, they fool me, and Carol make my headache.
[time=805] So please don't sing them.
[time=807] And don't take this the wrong way.
[time=811] But what's all this much about?
[time=813] Just one day.
[time=818] There's just no way to get around it.
[time=821] And I don't like Christmas.
[time=825] You won't paint my mind about it.
[time=828] I don't like Christmas.
[time=831] Everybody, I don't like Christmas.
[time=836] I expect the bigger response.
[time=838] That's okay, you'll get it next time.
[time=840] You don't like Christmas?
[time=841] It's just crazy.
[time=843] Believe it, sweetie.
[time=845] I don't like candy canes.
[time=847] They give you cavities.
[time=849] And Christmas trees that aggravate my allergies.
[time=852] Docking summers fall apart.
[time=854] So please don't buy them.
[time=856] And don't take this the wrong way.
[time=860] But what's all this much about?
[time=862] Just one day.
[time=866] There's just no way to get around it.
[time=870] I don't like Christmas.
[time=874] She won't change my life without it.
[time=878] I don't like Christmas.
[time=881] In the contract, and deep in the fine print, it clearly stinks.
[time=886] No, Christmas celebrated.
[time=888] You do not have the proof I need, and I can evict them for good.
[time=892] I really don't like Christmas.
[time=901] Can you believe it's nearly time for our nativity play?
[time=904] Thank you all for working so hard to prepare for tonight's community outreach.
[time=909] If any of you brought Christmas accessories, please take the time now to put them on.
[time=913] Before we run our dress rehearsal, are there any questions?
[time=916] Are we going to have a snack today?
[time=918] Can we use real live sheep?
[time=920] Are you crazy?
[time=922] Who wants to snack all live sheep?
[time=925] Yes, we will be having snack today, and no, we will not be using live sheep.
[time=930] Also, this isn't a question, but I heard the cross because have chicken pox.
[time=935] Yes, I'm aware that our wise men will not be joined tonight, but God will provide. He always does.
[time=942] So, it looks like the noon of black should be active at the jingle alert?
[time=946] Not yet. We still don't know what's on these boxes.
[time=949] Wait, we need to be careful not to...
[time=951] Let me help.
[time=954] Well, who do we have over here?
[time=956] Come on out, don't be shy.
[time=958] Are you here for the dress rehearsal? I'm Miss Maple.
[time=961] Yes, we are.
[time=963] Well, it looks like this was perfect.
[time=965] Three parts just opened up.
[time=968] Josiah, will you please help our new wise men with their costumes?
[time=972] Now, let's continue our rehearsal with the song
[time=979] about what was happening before the angels and before the manger.
[time=983] Those people had been waiting, longing for a savior.
[time=986] The people that walked to the darkness of night
[time=1002] They told her to quiet it out the light In expectation they waited in vain For hope for the future, a king to say God with us, Emmanuel, Emmanuel Here with us, Emmanuel, Emmanuel On miracle, come down as us Emmanuel, Emmanuel To a broken world, the Messiah came Bringing peace and hope There's my name In just a baby boy, the hope for all men Christ has come, Christ will come again God with us, Emmanuel, Emmanuel Here with us, Emmanuel, Emmanuel On miracle, come down as us Emmanuel, Emmanuel Good news to the Lord, good news For the broken hearts and news For the captives, good news For those who find good news Emmanuel, God with us We're singing good news Emmanuel, God with us Tell the world good news Emmanuel, God with us We're singing good news Emmanuel, God with us Good news to the Lord, good news For the broken hearts and news
[time=1120] For the captives, good news For those who find good news
[time=1135] For those who find good news
[time=1141] So how are we going to figure out Within all these boxes?
[time=1144] I know, I could use my X-miss ray It can penetrate most any material And let us see what is inside Will you go distract Miss Maple and the others?
[time=1154] No problem, Agent F, this is what's called Creating a diversion Oh, oh no, I slipped on this candy cane
[time=1165] Oh no, are you alright?
[time=1166] Yes, it's called a diversion I'm drawing attention to myself So that Agent L can figure out what's going in all these boxes Ah, nice Oh, this is terrible, can you walk?
[time=1177] Are you alright? What happened?
[time=1179] I slipped on this candy cane How did a candy cane get on our stage?
[time=1186] I don't know what I think my ankle is The X-miss ray worked, mission accomplished Feeling much better, thanks Oh, thank goodness Wise men, will you please help us unload the boxes They've been arriving all week While the shepherds, angels and sheep join me on stage Now, let's start at the top of the scene with the angels And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby Keeping watch over their flocks at night Let's stop for a minute Shepherds, how should you be reacting right now?
[time=1220] Terrified?
[time=1222] I've seen you look terrified, that's not it How about this?
[time=1227] That's not it either How would you react?
[time=1231] If you're a dog, ate your iPod Ahhh!
[time=1237] Yes, we're getting closer, but let's keep working on it So, when did you find out? Did your X-miss ray work?
[time=1245] Of course I worked When did my inventions not work?
[time=1249] Okay, I take that back So what was inside? Was it something dangerous and illegal?
[time=1256] Shoes! We can't activate the jingle, there's nothing more than shoes to report
[time=1262] Let's keep investigating Okay, cast, we have our shepherds and our angels Now, let's think about the message that was given to those ordinary shepherds Go on and go God's people had been waiting as long as they could remember And the Messiah was finally to be born It was the best news that they could have hoped for Don't be afraid
[time=1290] I've got the greatest news in history Don't be afraid Though it seems a mystery Find a little child Line in a manger This will be a sign Find a way to save your inner baby
[time=1323] Glory, glory to God In the highest glory, glory to God
[time=1335] In the highest peace comes out To earth in the baby Glory, glory to God
[time=1351] Find a little child Line in a manger This will be a sign Find a way to save your inner baby
[time=1368] Glory, glory to God In the highest glory, glory to God
[time=1380] In the highest peace comes out To earth in the baby Glory, glory to God
[time=1396] Glory, glory to God
[time=1413] Commander, when do you expect an update from your team?
[time=1429] I'm anxious to continue my Christmas celebrations Don't worry, Miss King, I'm sure we'll receive a transmission any minute now Excellent, I've scattered a quick manicure in the lounge while I wait Lounge, what lounge?
[time=1445] That tiny space around the corner My office?
[time=1449] Oh, sure, sweetie Commander, why are we helping her?
[time=1457] What do you mean agent, Tiny?
[time=1459] She's our client, of course we want to help her She, she doesn't like Christmas Why would you say something like that?
[time=1467] I heard her say it with my own ears I heard her say if they were doing anything with Christmas she would evict them I don't know what that means, but it doesn't sound nice It means kick them out Don't panic, we'll simply call the emergency channel on their hats Telling them not to activate the jungle alert You two stay here, Tiny, come with me Attention, we have an update
[time=1493] We are very excited to tell you that we have surpassed our goal In our tracking packages coming in by the truckload At this rate, we'll be able to bless hundreds of families in our community Children, I thank God for each one of you Many of you have even sacrificed buying Christmas gifts for your own family In order to support this community project Bingo, I think we got what we need The boxes are Christmas gifts for the community Let's activate the jingle Mission accomplished
[time=1532] Okay, let's set for the major scene Narrator?
[time=1536] While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born V-I-K, emergency Does anyone hear that?
[time=1544] Where is that voice coming from?
[time=1546] My hand V-I-K, emergency V-I-K, emergency I'm sorry, I must have left my cell phone on Weird ringtone, dude I know, right?
[time=1558] Please, everyone leave your cell phones off until our program is finished Continue She wrapped them in cloth and placed them in a manger Because there was no room for them in the end Tonight we can see a star shine
[time=1588] And its splendor fills up the sky It's the same that appeared And the wise never knew When hope was born this night We can hear the Christmas bells ringing As softly a church wire sings It's the song used to praise The ancient days When hope was born this night Glory is not in the fire Yes, it's time You're built to order me Then all of them will sing a chorus of joy Because of what was born this night Glory Yeah Glory Yeah Glory Yeah Glory Yeah Glory Yeah Glory Yeah Glory Yeah Glory Yeah Glory is not in the fire Yes, it's time Good will to order me Let all of them will sing a chorus of joy Because of what was born this night We know what was born this night Because Christ was born This night This night
[time=1731] We know what was born this night
[time=1741] We know what was born this night Glory Yeah Glory Yeah Glory Yeah Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Can it wait until after this final rehearsal?
[time=1763] People have begun arriving and we have just a few more I hate to interrupt this little celebration Man, the doors actually won't be open for another ten minutes But if you've just been watching you for weeks with these packages coming in and out But I needed more, I needed real proof I'm afraid I don't understand Of course you don't Allow me to introduce myself I am this parrot king and this is my building What you seem to have overlooked is that on page 147 section 2 paragraph 3
[time=1797] It states there is to be no Celebrating of Christmas on the premises Why no, I was not aware of that Always read the fine print dear I can fix this right here I'll use my memory eraser on her And she'll forget all about not liking Christmas How cute, it's a flashlight Were you looking for this?
[time=1819] You left it in the lounge Now where were we?
[time=1823] Oh yes, you are in violation of the content and are to be evicted Effective immediately But what about the gifts?
[time=1833] What about the nativity?
[time=1835] What about the snacks?
[time=1837] Surely you understand Miss King that we have a huge event for the community
[time=1843] Perhaps you could make an exception Because it's Christmas Not a chance You have ten minutes to leave the property or I'll call the authorities Listen, we don't need a building to show God's love Our community has been selflessly given their time and treasure all month And I know that God will honor these efforts But how do you know?
[time=1865] The Bible says that we can trust God with all our hearts He's in control Yes Mary and Joseph trust God when they heard that King Herod was searching for the baby Jesus Mary believed that God had chosen her to get birth to his son And she knew that he would continue to take care of him Be still, know that I'm God I will be exalted among the nations, I'll be exalted among the earth There days you wake up and nothing's going your way
[time=1894] It's not always easy to simply trust and obey
[time=1900] But who's the one who holds the earth in the palm of his hand
[time=1906] Who comes to wins and stormy seas and counts the grace of sand
[time=1912] As the heavens are higher than the earth And the mountains rise higher than the sea God's wings are higher than the highest mountain
[time=1923] Higher than our ways could ever be
[time=1937] When there's one grace and the earth glutes when the world shakes He's still on time when the world breaks And the good guys glutes when the world shakes He's still on time He's still on time
[time=1962] Who's the one who holds the earth in the palm of his hand
[time=1968] Who comes to wins and stormy seas and counts the grace of sand
[time=1974] As the heavens are higher than the earth And the mountains rise higher than the sea God's wings are higher than the highest mountain
[time=1986] Higher than our ways could ever be
[time=2000] When there's one grace and the earth glutes when the world shakes He's still on time when the world breaks And the good guys glutes when the world shakes He's still on time when the storm breaks And the earth glutes when the world shakes He's still on time when the world breaks And the good guys glutes when the world shakes He's still on time He's still on time
[time=2037] He's still on time Everyone, will you please help us move the boxes outside And the major scene will go right in front of the building?
[time=2047] Did I forget to mention that on page 147, Section 2, paragraph 4, It states that if the contract is broken, Everything in the building belongs to me.
[time=2059] Well, we'll just start again.
[time=2061] It's just stuff, and true treasure isn't anything you can hold or touch.
[time=2065] That's right Josiah.
[time=2067] It sounds like people have begun arriving.
[time=2070] Let's all go outside and leave these packages with Ms. King.
[time=2074] Our celebration of the birth of Christ will go on as scheduled Without the props, the set, and even the gifts.
[time=2082] Well, good.
[time=2084] You're taking this much better than I expected.
[time=2087] I still don't understand.
[time=2089] You've been collecting these boxes for months.
[time=2091] Now you won't be able to help the community like we planned.
[time=2094] God's timing is perfect, and we don't want to do anything that he is not directing.
[time=2098] When it's time to give gifts, he will provide and make a way.
[time=2101] Until then, we just need to be faithful and give ourselves to him as a gift.
[time=2106] Are we ready?
[time=2108] Places everyone!
[time=2110] Merry Christmas everyone, and thank you all for coming.
[time=2113] We have encountered a few obstacles today, but we are thrilled to be able to remember with you.
[time=2118] The greatest Christmas gift ever!
[time=2133] The people who walk in darkness have seen a great life.
[time=2136] And those living in the land of deep darkness, Aylight has dawned.
[time=2141] So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth to Bethlehem, the town of David.
[time=2146] He went there to be registered with Mary, who's pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.
[time=2163] And he saw us, he met, and you were here.
[time=2171] Shall come to me, or it is right.
[time=2179] While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born.
[time=2185] And she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.
[time=2188] She arrived to be in cloth and placed them in a manger, because there was no room for them to end.
[time=2193] And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.
[time=2198] When an angel of the Lord appeared and said, "I bring you good news, unto you is born a savior.
[time=2205] He is Christ the Lord." And then a heavenly host of angels sang, "Go into God in the highest, peace on earth and good words for men."
[time=2214] And when they saw it, they were the host who found Joseph and Mary, and the baby, lying in the major.
[time=2221] After Jesus was born, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews?" We saw a star in the east and have come to worship.
[time=2244] A star of wonder, star of life, staring for your beauty right.
[time=2252] Last night, a silver sea got us to thy perfect heart.
[time=2261] When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.
[time=2266] Oncoming, they saw the child and his mother, Mary, and vowed down and worshipped him.
[time=2274] We were the men of santar, who were the men of santar.
[time=2299] For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders.
[time=2305] He will be called Wonderful Counselor, Magi God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[time=2312] Miss King, I brought something for you.
[time=2316] What? What do you mean?
[time=2318] It was my sisters and she was saving it for one to get bigger, but I like you to have it.
[time=2323] It's a bicycle with training wheels.
[time=2327] You said you wanted one.
[time=2329] But after I tried to stop the Christmas celebration, why would you be so kind to me?
[time=2336] The Bible says we can love, because God first loved us.
[time=2340] And that he died for our sins, even while we were his enemies.
[time=2344] And now he gives us some mercy to love others, even when they aren't loving us.
[time=2349] Tiss you! I need a tiss you!
[time=2354] And a latte while you're at it. Thank you, darling.
[time=2357] Extra hot, twelve pumps of vanilla.
[time=2360] Well, I'm at a loss, I say. A loss.
[time=2365] No one has ever shown me such kindness when I've been so, so less than perfect.
[time=2375] There's a tiny chance I may have overreacted.
[time=2380] Well, like the kids said, Miss King, when we give to others, we are imitating the actions of the greatest giver who gave us the ultimate gift two thousand years ago.
[time=2390] Jesus coming out to earth to save his people.
[time=2393] Well, that's just amazing. I guess I never realized what Christmas was really about.
[time=2399] Hey, everyone, don't just stand there.
[time=2402] We need to get these packages out to the people in the community who need them.
[time=2406] King, I want to go with me to pass out the gifts. Only if I can ride my bicycle.
[time=2411] Do you know how to ride a bike? No. How hard can it be?
[time=2415] Oh boy. But first, I feel a song coming on.
[time=2419] Can I have a spotlight following me over here, please?
[time=2422] Oh, well, we're on it. Thank you. That's better.
[time=2427] I like this garland.
[time=2431] I like this wreath, and those cholly little elves, well, I guess they're kind of sweet.
[time=2436] I like those carols, so keep on singing.
[time=2440] I just want to stand and say, let's all celebrate Christmas Day.
[time=2450] There's just no way to get around it.
[time=2454] I love Christmas.
[time=2458] You won't take my mind about it.
[time=2461] I love Christmas, everybody.
[time=2465] I love Christmas.
[time=2469] There's just no way to get around it.
[time=2472] I love Christmas.
[time=2476] You won't take my mind about it.
[time=2479] I love Christmas.
[time=2493] Good news for the broken hearts, good news for the captains, good news for those who ride the news.
[time=2501] Emmanuel, God with us, we're singing good news.
[time=2506] Emmanuel, God with us tell the world good news.
[time=2510] Emmanuel, God with us, we're singing good news.
[time=2515] Emmanuel, God with us.
[time=2530] On the cover, don't breathe a word.
[time=2535] On the turn, and you're spreading peace on earth.
[time=2541] On the cover, write it for your eyes.
[time=2547] Activate it, the one that gave us birth.
[time=2552] We're Christmas intelligence kids.
[time=2575] Hey, this month, on Sunday mornings, we've been just so far.
[time=2584] We've been really celebrating a theme.
[time=2588] We talked about it last week.
[time=2589] O come, let us adore him.
[time=2592] O come, let us make much of him.
[time=2595] Last week, we said, O come, let us adore him in the past.
[time=2598] And we've looked to the past and all that God had done.
[time=2602] Today, we want to look to the present.
[time=2604] How is it that the great truth of Christmas should affect the way you and I live today?
[time=2611] Next week, we'll come back and we'll look to the future.
[time=2615] O come, let us adore him in the past, present, and future.
[time=2620] Let me ask you this question this morning as we start.
[time=2623] How should our present day lives be different?
[time=2626] In light of Christmas and its reality.
[time=2629] I want you to think about this this morning because I would suggest to you today, and I would suggest this to you with all my heart, that the reality of Christmas really does allow your everyday life
[time=2642] to be, and I'm going to give you three things this morning.
[time=2646] Number one, miraculous.
[time=2649] That first Christmas was a miracle.
[time=2653] Oh, it was a miracle.
[time=2655] It was a miracle of all miracles.
[time=2657] Write that down, miraculous.
[time=2659] Mary was miraculous.
[time=2662] A character filled, virgin, teenage, Jewish girl impregnated by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2670] That's how that happened.
[time=2673] Impregnated by the Holy Spirit to carry and deliver a baby who would be Jesus the Messiah,
[time=2679] King of Kings, God in the flesh, and Savior of the world.
[time=2685] This is what transpired.
[time=2687] It's a miracle.
[time=2688] The star that led the Magi to the newborn king was a miracle.
[time=2692] The angel coming in the night to marry and Joseph, miraculous.
[time=2697] And then there's Jesus himself.
[time=2699] Then there's Jesus himself, the cornerstone of Christmas.
[time=2704] His mission, redeemer of the world.
[time=2709] His mission is miraculous.
[time=2712] And his power is miraculous.
[time=2715] And he does, oh, make no mistake about it, friends, he does give both.
[time=2721] He gives both his mission and he gives his power.
[time=2726] He gives them both to those fully devoted to following him.
[time=2732] Oh, please listen, church, if you have fully surrendered, have you?
[time=2736] If you have fully surrendered your heart and life to following, trusting in and following
[time=2743] the Son of God, if that is a reality in your life, your life really can be unspeakably
[time=2751] special.
[time=2753] When the Spirit of Christ, the Christ of Christmas resides in you.
[time=2758] There are things that can happen.
[time=2762] There's stuff that can really transpire.
[time=2765] When the Spirit of Christ is really, truly in you, you can be used by God himself to
[time=2772] invite and lead people toward life-saving faith.
[time=2776] The mission of Christ can become yours and you can become a participant in this most
[time=2782] miraculous endeavor of seeing people come to faith in Christ.
[time=2788] You can, when the Spirit of Christ resides in you, you can't overcome addiction.
[time=2795] You can experience the miracle of freedom because the miraculous Christ child, Scripture said, is in you, empowering you and not mildly empowering you, but miraculously
[time=2809] empowering you.
[time=2811] You can, when the Spirit of Christ resides in you, you can offer hope and encouragement
[time=2819] in the lives of those whose hearts are darkened and saddened by the loneliness they feel
[time=2825] at a time of year when many are hurting because the miracle of Jesus being born is greater
[time=2832] than the pain of anyone passing away and the loss that those close to them feel.
[time=2837] You can trumpet that truth.
[time=2839] You can be a conduit of miraculous comfort and grace.
[time=2846] You can.
[time=2847] You can live a miraculous life.
[time=2850] Sacrificial giving is miraculous in this day and age.
[time=2855] Sharing your faith is miraculous.
[time=2857] Encouragement and support in this self-centered culture of ours is miraculous.
[time=2863] Pursuing peace and restoration in relationships in a world that almost values conflict and
[time=2870] division.
[time=2871] It's miraculous.
[time=2872] Serving others at this time of year is miraculous.
[time=2876] So what's your life?
[time=2881] Honestly, what's your life look like these days?
[time=2884] Does your life, does my life, do our lives look miraculous?
[time=2893] Or do they just look mundane?
[time=2898] Would your life just look normal?
[time=2908] Or is there something truly special going on in you as you live out this faith at a time of year where there are so many opportunities for you and I to live it out?
[time=2917] What's your life look like miraculous or mundane the spirit of Christ when it's alive and present in your life gives you and I the opportunity to live lives in this day and age in your world and mind that are special.
[time=2934] Second thing, I hope you'll write this down.
[time=2937] I hope you'll write this down.
[time=2939] The reality of Christmas allows your everyday life to be joyful, to be joyful, joy, joy, joy.
[time=2948] The coming of the promised King, the Christmas birth of the Messiah, the entrance of humanity's redeemer brought about a great soul-stirring life-changing joy.
[time=2961] It really did. Mary became joyful. If you've got your vitals or you've got your phone or your iPad, you want to look this up with me, you can Luke 1, think it'll be on the screen as well.
[time=2974] Mary gets woken up, she in a dream, or gets approached by an angel, she's told the entire story, all that will take place.
[time=2986] She says in verse 38 of Luke chapter 1 and Mary said, "Behold, the bond slave of the Lord, may it be done to me according to your word."
[time=2995] And the angel departed from her and then look what she says in 46 and 47.
[time=3000] This is Mary's response to her life being utterly turned upside down.
[time=3005] This faithful young Jewish girl who's been chosen by God to bear the Messiah, here is the first words out of her mouth, verse 46 and 47.
[time=3016] And Mary said, "My soul exalts the Lord and my spirit has rejoiced."
[time=3025] There's the word joy. There's this picture of joyfulness that is not complaining, it is not fear, it is not pessimism, it is not negative, it is joyful.
[time=3038] She is stirred in her heart and her response is to rejoice.
[time=3043] "And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior, and this plan that he has designed."
[time=3051] Mary became joyful.
[time=3053] The angels were filled with joy. Look at Luke 2.
[time=3058] It says in Luke 2, verse 8, "In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night, and an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them."
[time=3071] And they were terribly frightened, but the angels said to him, "Do not be afraid for behold, I bring you good news of great what?"
[time=3081] Say it, joy.
[time=3083] The angels knew.
[time=3085] The angels knew this was a good deal.
[time=3088] The angels knew this was really special.
[time=3090] The angels had it in their hearts.
[time=3092] The angels were filled with this reality of what was about to transpire and the joy, the joy that it brought.
[time=3100] The magi joyously gave.
[time=3104] The shepherds joyfully honored.
[time=3107] It was Christmas, Christmas.
[time=3110] It was exciting to these people who experienced it.
[time=3114] It was hope giving.
[time=3115] It was celebratory.
[time=3117] It stirred something deep in the hearts of people.
[time=3122] And please take this the right way.
[time=3125] It wasn't this first, this first pure Christmas.
[time=3132] It wasn't fundamentally about gifts.
[time=3135] It wasn't fundamentally about big meals, decorations, travel plans, sales, or returns.
[time=3143] It was fundamentally, please don't miss this, about the joy, the thrill and the joy of Christ.
[time=3154] How's the song go?
[time=3156] What?
[time=3157] To the world?
[time=3161] For the Lord has what?
[time=3163] For the Lord has come.
[time=3165] So question for you this morning.
[time=3166] How's your spirit today?
[time=3171] How's your attitude?
[time=3175] How are you conducting yourself?
[time=3179] How are you treating those closest and dearest to you?
[time=3183] How are you treating those you don't even know?
[time=3186] What's your spirit like today?
[time=3188] If you know the Lord, if you have fully surrendered your heart and life to Him in the spirit of the Christ of Christmas resides in you.
[time=3195] You have the capacity, my friends, to be filled, filled with joy.
[time=3203] Filled with joy.
[time=3205] How's your spirit today?
[time=3206] Are you choosing joy?
[time=3208] Let me remind you that it is a choice.
[time=3211] Your joy in mine is not tied to our circumstance.
[time=3215] The kids did a great job of depicting that this morning.
[time=3219] God chose to send His only son to a manger in a cave you can choose to be grateful and gracious.
[time=3227] Amen?
[time=3228] You can make that choice.
[time=3231] God chose to send to earth at this time the sacrifice for our sins.
[time=3236] You can choose to be joyful and kind.
[time=3240] The sacrifice of our sins.
[time=3242] I'm reminded of a message I got this week.
[time=3245] I don't usually bring my phone up here.
[time=3247] I just didn't have time to copy it down so I'll read it from my phone.
[time=3250] Wrong one.
[time=3251] Sorry.
[time=3253] It was a tweet.
[time=3254] I don't know if you're on Twitter.
[time=3256] If you're not on Twitter, you might want to think about it.
[time=3258] You can go to our website and follow Steve Webster and myself.
[time=3261] You can follow Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=3263] We send out messages all the time on this thing.
[time=3268] On Twitter, Steve Webster, this past week, he sent along to the rest of us something from Tim Keller.
[time=3275] I love listening to Tim Keller.
[time=3277] I love reading Tim Keller.
[time=3279] He's a tremendous mind, a great pastor of a great church in New York City.
[time=3283] Tim Keller tweeted this week this.
[time=3285] He said, "The sin, the sin under all other sin."
[time=3293] And think about your sin for just a moment.
[time=3297] We won't dwell there, but think about your sin.
[time=3300] And I'll think about mine.
[time=3303] And he says, "The sin under all other sin is tied to a lack of joy in Christ."
[time=3315] And that is so true.
[time=3317] It is your thinking and mine at times that somehow you can find joy somewhere else and
[time=3326] something else at some other time and some other place than what God has designed.
[time=3332] Oh, what a tragic mistake.
[time=3334] Keller says, "The great truth underlying all sin is this lack of joy in Christ."
[time=3340] And my friends, what a privilege you have at this time of year to experience and to project
[time=3347] and to communicate the great joy, the satisfaction, the peace, the gratitude, the happiness.
[time=3355] Of a Savior who came so you could have life.
[time=3359] Third thing, and we'll be done.
[time=3361] Third thing, the reality of Christmas really does allow your everyday life to be miraculous,
[time=3368] to be joyful, and thirdly to be obedient.
[time=3372] To be marked by and to be characterized by obedience.
[time=3377] Think about this.
[time=3378] It didn't make any sense.
[time=3381] It made no sense.
[time=3383] Start with Joseph.
[time=3385] Maybe 17, 18, 19 years old.
[time=3389] A really faithful, hard-working guy who had a girl he loved and a future he was hoping for.
[time=3395] And true story, this isn't a movie.
[time=3397] It really happened.
[time=3399] And he gets told by her, later corroborated by the angel.
[time=3405] Think about it.
[time=3406] His girlfriend comes to him and says she's what?
[time=3408] Say it.
[time=3409] Say it louder.
[time=3411] Yeah, were they married?
[time=3413] No.
[time=3414] He's a good dude.
[time=3416] And she's telling him she's pregnant.
[time=3418] And any dude whose girlfriend tells him that she's what?
[time=3424] Is always going to ask the question, how?
[time=3431] Who?
[time=3433] And she says, glad you asked.
[time=3436] It was God.
[time=3439] No, that's what she said.
[time=3441] In essence, that's what she said, right?
[time=3444] So you're him.
[time=3446] And your girlfriend just told you she's pregnant by God.
[time=3453] And he does what?
[time=3454] The angel comes and says, hey, it's true, it's okay.
[time=3460] Keep going here.
[time=3462] And he does.
[time=3464] He obeys.
[time=3466] Mary.
[time=3468] Same thing.
[time=3470] She gets told this, this thing happens to her.
[time=3474] And she's got to go talk to her boyfriend.
[time=3476] And God says that's sort of kind of what you've got to lead with.
[time=3479] You've got to tell him it's, you know, that's hard.
[time=3482] She obeys.
[time=3483] Faith fulfilled with character.
[time=3485] Then there's Jesus himself.
[time=3486] Don't forget Jesus.
[time=3487] Don't forget Jesus existed.
[time=3489] You know, pre-incarnate person of Christ.
[time=3492] Jesus exists for all eternity passed in the Trinity there in perfect community.
[time=3497] Here's Jesus in the bliss of heaven.
[time=3500] In the absolute joy of relationship with God the Father.
[time=3504] In a place that you and I will never know or understand.
[time=3507] I mean, he gets told by God who it says throughout the Gospels.
[time=3511] The one thing he always wanted to do was just honor the Father.
[time=3514] So God says you're going, you're going down.
[time=3517] You're going to a womb.
[time=3520] And you're going to live.
[time=3524] And he says, yes.
[time=3525] And I want to just encourage you this morning.
[time=3527] He's telling you whatever the Word of God speaks to you.
[time=3530] You and I can, especially in this season, like those who have gone before us.
[time=3535] Be obedient.
