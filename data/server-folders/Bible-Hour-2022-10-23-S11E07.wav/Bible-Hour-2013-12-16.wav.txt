[time=30] Come let us adore him. What a great few weeks it's been. And what an opportunity for us as a family to look at the past, to engage in the present. And then this morning to look toward the future. And I want to introduce to you this morning. We're going to have a couple of guys come and just share some stories of life change and transformation.
[time=59] With you today, would you all say hello to Ryan. Say good morning, Ryan.
[time=65] Morning. This is Ryan. He and his wife, Sarah, been a part of our family for a number of years. And I've asked him to come and share about not only the transformation that's taken place in the past. Listen for that. But I really want you to listen as he shares with you briefly.
[time=82] Listen for what God is doing with regards to his future. It really is an encouragement and I'm so thankful that he agreed to do this. So, Ryan, tell him what God's been up to.
[time=92] Thank you. I want to thank Kelly for the opportunity to briefly share some things that Jesus has been doing with my family through our church in the past, presently, and how he's leading us into the future.
[time=102] My wife Sarah, my three kids, Simon, Marnie, and then soon to be born, Jack was born moved to Fort Wayne in December of 2008. At the time we had never been a church going family.
[time=114] Sarah had surrendered her heart to Christ several years before, but had straight sense. I was a Christmas and Easter Christian going enough to get confirmed and then going on the big Sundays ever since.
[time=124] However, we were both determined to make sure our kids received a good Christian education. And from the outside in, it probably didn't make much sense.
[time=131] But as I look back at what has transpired since it made all the sense in the world, we were being led.
[time=136] We enrolled Marnie into the early childhood program here at Black Hawk starting in the fall of 2010 and that's when the ball started rolling.
[time=143] Soon after Sarah and I started having conversations about getting our family to church. Although Black Hawk was so close, literally right across the street, and our daughter was attending school here, the church just seemed too big and we were afraid of getting lost in such a big congregation.
[time=158] So we tried a couple of smaller local churches, neither moved us enough to return. So finally, in early 2011, we made a life-changing decision.
[time=167] We were very pleased with how Marnie was developing and the contact we had experienced with the early childhood staff was just awesome.
[time=173] So we made our way into a Sunday service here at Black Hawk.
[time=176] Over the next couple of months, Kelly was focused on one of Paul's letters to Timothy and I've read both books so many times, I'm not sure which one he was covering then.
[time=185] But, and I know it's a cliche, it felt like the room was empty and he was talking directly to me.
[time=190] All the questions I had about what I meant to love Jesus and what it meant to be a leader, father, and example of a man in Christ all seemed to fade.
[time=199] I later thanked Kelly, but he reminded me it wasn't his words, but it was the Holy Spirit that moved me.
[time=204] Then on Easter Sunday, April 24, 2011, on Little Jack's second birthday, we had the Easter door set up down here in front of the church.
[time=212] Kelly said that anyone who wanted to walk through a door, leave their past behind, and walk into a life with Christ was welcome to come down.
[time=219] I looked at Sarah and I simply said, "I've got to go." Her reply was just as simple yet profound, "Let's go." I walked through a door, told Kelly I wanted to surrender my heart and life to Jesus Christ.
[time=231] I stumbled through a prayer with Chris Mitchell and I began a new life with Jesus as my foundation.
[time=236] Over the last couple of years, our whole family has grown in Christ exponentially.
[time=241] Sarah has soon followed my lead and rededicated her life to Christ.
[time=245] To hear her testimony is a true inspiration and example of how his love will never fail nor give up.
[time=251] She is currently on the children's ministry staff and works very hard at helping Janice and the whole children's ministry team ensure our little ones have a loving Christ filled experience every Sunday.
[time=260] Little Jack is now an early childhood program and seems to be having the same wonderful experience that Marney had.
[time=266] Marney's moved across the street to BCS Elementary and is thriving in kindergarten and our oldest Simon seems to be primed to be the next in our family to surrender his heart to Christ.
[time=275] As for me, his work on my heart continues.
[time=278] Presently, I am attending Huntington University seeking a major career change.
[time=282] I feel a strong calling towards ministry and I'm not going to question it.
[time=286] I know there are many out there who are just like I was.
[time=289] Wanting to know Christ but not knowing what that means.
[time=292] Many of us know the overwhelming feeling you get, the hour you first believed.
[time=296] I want that feeling shared with as many as possible.
[time=299] I am praying that in some way he will use my experiences in that capacity.
[time=304] Through all of this, my family still recognizes that we are definitely sinners.
[time=307] We are far from perfect and we stumble daily.
[time=310] Personally, I've opened a door of dealing with an addiction but have yet to walk through it.
[time=313] And I've committed some small group settings but the fear of judgment hinders me from being as open as I want to be or attending his office and I need to.
[time=320] As a family, it sometimes seems like a war zone when you walk into our house.
[time=324] Toys are being thrown, incognito kicks are slightly being administered and raised voices that go off the walls.
[time=330] However, I know he is continuously helping us grow.
[time=333] Through each stumble, he lifts us up, dust us off and sets us back on a path of life dedicated to him.
[time=339] For what we have experienced, we obviously owe some gratitude.
[time=343] Because of our past and present here at Black Hawk, we have been inspired to build a future on a Christ-centered foundation.
[time=349] Moreover, my family will forever thank God for using Kelly and our brothers and sisters in Christ right here in this room to lead us out of the darkness and into the light.
[time=358] But more than anything else, I thank God for giving this wretch the most precious Christmas gift one could ever receive.
[time=364] The love, grace and forgiveness of the Son and our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=369] Thank you for letting me share.
[time=374] Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=376] It is a great opportunity to spend a couple of minutes with you here today.
[time=380] What a great month it's been.
[time=382] What a great season it is.
[time=384] December, as most of you know, is filled with celebration here at Black Hawk.
[time=388] We call it Christmas with Black Hawk and what a Christmas it's been.
[time=392] What a great reminder to all of us.
[time=395] Not only the birth of Christ, but the life of Christ, the death of Christ and the resurrection, which makes possible for everyone who knows him.
[time=405] Forgiveness of sin and a future eternity that is unmatched.
[time=411] All of that truth has come into clear focus in recent days for me and many others here in Fort Wayne as we've experienced the loss of a good friend.
[time=422] Dan Chitwood, who has served as senior pastor and part of the senior leadership team at Crossbridge Church for years.
[time=429] Dan was a good friend of mine, a great friend of Black Hawks and one who served the community of Fort Wayne faithfully.
[time=438] The team at Crossbridge, that family at Crossbridge has been a light in this city and God has done amazing things through them and through Dan's leadership and a week ago or so Dan passed away.
[time=451] And he will be terribly missed and I'm inviting all of you in the Church of Fort Wayne, those of you who believe in the Kingdom of God going forward here.
[time=461] I want to ask you to pray for Crossbridge.
[time=464] I want you to pray for Dan's family.
[time=466] I want you to pray for that team of people at Crossbridge who will continue to go forward in the days to come.
[time=472] And I'm so grateful that I got to know him, so thankful that he was one who I counted as a friend.
[time=479] I'm so thankful for the things that he was able to pass along to so many people.
[time=484] Not only at Crossbridge, but here in Fort Wayne, to young people and old people alike.
[time=489] He was a wonderful man, a tremendous husband and father and a great friend.
[time=494] It's a reminder, Dan's life and Dan's passing.
[time=498] It is a reminder to each and every one of us.
[time=501] He was, I think, 45 years old.
[time=503] He was getting dressed to go to his daughter's basketball game and then it was over, life on earth, done.
[time=512] And I want to just remind you that it says in the Bible, life is a vapor.
[time=517] It is a hot breath on a cold night.
[time=519] It is here and it is gone, just like that.
[time=523] And I hope, we hope, that you are someone who understands and is ready for your future.
[time=530] I hope that you have an understanding of Christ and his forgiveness and the life that he offers.
[time=537] My hope is that you have come to fully surrender your heart and life to the Son of God.
[time=543] And with that surrender comes the assurance of eternal life.
[time=547] Oh, how thankful I am for Dan Chitwood and how grateful I am for the chance to use his life and his example here this morning
[time=556] as an opportunity to remind each and every one of you of that which matters most, your eternity.
[time=562] God bless you.
[time=563] Our hope is that the Christmas season here at Blackhawk has been an encouragement to you.
[time=568] I can't wait for you to hear the message today and I can't wait to start a new year.
[time=574] Hopefully you will come and be a part of it with us.
[time=577] God bless you.
[time=578] God bless you Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
[time=591] I bless softly the world I see Heaven best to work in the Lord.
[time=607] Christmas morning, children waking to hear the sacred story, joy to the world.
[time=628] A Lord has come, bring the bells in, let you wear, bring the bells in, let you wear.
[time=651] God has come, bring the bells in, let you wear.
[time=660] So turn the halls of angels singing, glory to the newborn Christ.
[time=677] God, good news fills the sky, bring the bells in, let you wear, bring the bells in, let you wear.
[time=702] God has come, come along the way.
[time=708] Wonderful Savior has come to live for us.
[time=713] Out of the darkness and into this darkness, God that has given us life.
[time=723] Thank you Lord.
[time=728] So shine your love, shine your love, shine your love, shine your love.
[time=740] The Lord has come, shine to the world, shine to the world, bring the bells in, let you wear.
[time=764] Bring the bells in, let you wear, bring the bells in, let you wear.
[time=779] Let the bells in, let you wear, bring the bells in, let you wear, bring the bells in, let you wear.
[time=799] Let the bells in, let you wear, bring the bells in, let you wear.
[time=813] [APPLAUSE]
[time=823] This is one of those Sundays, it's just a great Sunday for musicians, for singers, for instrumentalists.
[time=831] Could you help me thank all of these people up here one more time?
[time=840] We appreciate you.
[time=842] Also the tech team that are behind the scenes, we thank you too, we couldn't do it without you.
[time=848] Yeah, go ahead.
[time=853] Awesome.
[time=855] The choir is going to be joining us for one more song here today.
[time=859] This one is called "Miracle."
[time=868] [MUSIC]
[time=881] I'm absolutely convinced that nothing living or dead, angelic or demonic, today or tomorrow,
[time=889] higher low, thinkable or unthinkable, absolutely nothing can get between us and God's love
[time=896] because of the way that Jesus, our master has embraced us.
[time=904] When the wrappings have all been undone, when the carols for a season sung,
[time=916] that mange a scene comes off the shelf, I'm trying to trust that story for myself.
[time=933] Our father's love would grant his son to reclaim his lost and helpless ones,
[time=944] that the lame would walk and blind would see.
[time=950] It all reminds me of a mystery.
[time=956] [MUSIC]
[time=959] Neither life nor death, nor power sun seen, not the fears about tomorrow,
[time=972] neither height nor damp, can never separate us from me.
[time=982] [MUSIC - 5 seconds]
[time=993] When the sun is of my desperate one,
[time=1000] through the love and beauty part, we need the loneliness to see,
[time=1012] to house the five-night place for fame.
[time=1019] In the light of your redeeming love,
[time=1025] through the power of your name or Jesus, I can scream it from the mountains of us,
[time=1037] and a child of the fear of God without us.
[time=1044] [MUSIC]
[time=1046] Neither life nor death, nor power sun seen, not the fears about tomorrow,
[time=1059] neither height nor depth, can never separate us from me.
[time=1067] [MUSIC]
[time=1082] Lord, today we rejoice in your unfailing love, your patience, and your kindness.
[time=1089] Today we will claim your power of love.
[time=1094] In the light of your redeeming love, through the power of your name, Lord Jesus, I can scream it from the mountain tops, I'm a child of God, in the light of your redeeming love,
[time=1148] through the power of your name, Lord Jesus, I can scream it from the mountain tops, I'm a child of God.
[time=1161] Neither life nor death, nor powers unseen,
[time=1167] not the fears and bouts, tomorrow.
[time=1174] Neither life nor death, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, tomorrow.
[time=1185] Neither heights nor death, nor powers unseen,
[time=1193] not the fears and bouts, tomorrow.
[time=1199] Neither heights nor death, nor powers unseen,
[time=1205] nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, nor powers unseen, not the fears and bouts, your life, your life where it's been, your life where it is today.
[time=1262] Question for you, what will your future look like?
[time=1267] Going forward from this time, in light of all that has transpired, in light of all that you've experienced, you being you, what will your future look like?
[time=1277] How will you live in the days to come?
[time=1280] What's it gonna be like for you?
[time=1282] Your life being what it's been, what will you live with in the days to come?
[time=1290] What baggage or burdens will you carry?
[time=1293] Will your future, here's a question for you, will your future be filled with or free from?
[time=1301] Will your future be filled with or free from shame?
[time=1305] Regret, fear, uncertainty, confusion.
[time=1314] The truth is, all the great truth is that Christmas gives us an answer.
[time=1321] A clear and powerful answer to these very questions regarding your future in mind.
[time=1327] So this morning, here you go, how can the Christ of Christmas impact your future or better said, how should?
[time=1335] How should the Christ of Christmas impact your future?
[time=1338] You see my friends, according to the word of God, according to these very scriptures, the fact that Jesus was born, the fact that Messiah did come, the fact that that first Christmas really occurred actually means something.
[time=1355] It actually means that every Christmas from here on out, that every day, every month, every year of your life, that your future, all of it, can be filled with two things, your future.
[time=1373] Every one of you in this room can be filled with two things.
[time=1376] I hope you'll write these down.
[time=1378] I hope you'll not only write these down this morning on a piece of paper with a pen or pencil.
[time=1383] I hope you'll write these in your heart today.
[time=1386] I hope you'll write this on your mind.
[time=1388] I hope that you will carry these truths with you tomorrow into the celebrations of this week and on into a new year.
[time=1397] Here you go, your future because of Christmas and the Christ of Christmas can be filled with two things, number one, peace.
[time=1405] Will you write that down?
[time=1407] Peace.
[time=1408] Your entire future can be characterized by, your entire future can be bracketed by, your entire future from this day forward, can be overshadowed by the presence of peace.
[time=1425] You can possess a peaceful future.
[time=1429] And secondly, purpose.
[time=1430] I'll please write that down.
[time=1432] Purpose, your entire future can be shaped and guided by a divine and transcendent mission.
[time=1439] That's right, there is a strategic eternal assignment for you to embrace, you, and I mean you.
[time=1446] I mean every one of you in this room that would be willing to or has, bow the knee of your heart and fully surrendered your heart and life to follow the Son of God.
[time=1456] You have been given, you have, you can possess a strategic eternal assignment.
[time=1464] You have a meaningful contribution to make.
[time=1468] Young people, middle-aged, old senior adults, doesn't matter.
[time=1473] There's something beyond you, bigger than you that God has given you to embrace.
[time=1479] Let's start with peace.
[time=1480] Your future, your future can be filled with peace.
[time=1484] If you know, if you really know the Christ of Christmas, then you know that He came to make peace where there was one's hostility.
[time=1492] He came to bring peace where there was one's confusion, enmity and strife.
[time=1498] Isaiah chapter nine, let's look at a few passages just to remind us of really the centrality of the message of peace and the Christmas narrative and the Christmas truth.
[time=1509] It says in Isaiah nine, you see it on the screen, verse six.
[time=1512] Isaiah nine, verse six, it says, "For a child will be born to us, "a son will be given to us," that's the Christ, "and the government will rest on his shoulders, "and his name will be called Wonderful Counselor, "Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace." And then it goes on in verse seven to say this.
[time=1534] I love this, there will be and there will be no end to the increase of his government.
[time=1541] Stop there.
[time=1542] I wanna just remind you of this side note, we'll come back to peace, but understand this from the very beginning, the government, you say what government?
[time=1549] I say the government, the government of our world, the government of this reality, all governments, all kings, all rulers from the outset, God's design was for all of it to rest on his shoulders
[time=1568] and it does, on the Lord's shoulders, on Messiah, our king, all government has from the beginning does today and will forever.
[time=1579] What does it say?
[time=1580] There will be no end to the increase of his government.
[time=1585] His government, his rule, his reign, his sovereign control.
[time=1592] I know it seems confusing today.
[time=1594] I know it seems a little topsy-turvy.
[time=1597] I know we speculate at times as to how it's gonna go, he's got it.
[time=1604] He's got it, it's all his.
[time=1610] And as the days go by and as the future unfolds, there will be no end to the increase of his government, his rule, but oh, don't miss that second part.
[time=1622] There will be no end to the increase of his, say it, peace.
[time=1628] His peace.
[time=1629] My friends, the child born to us this season brings unending peace.
[time=1636] He brings to you and he brings to me unending peace.
[time=1641] It's true, look at Luke two.
[time=1643] Luke two and the gospel of Luke and that great Christmas narrative, it says they're in Luke chapter two, verse 13, it says and suddenly they're appeared to the shepherds, they were out in the fields and suddenly they're appeared with the angel of multitude, millions of heavenly hosts and they were praising God.
[time=1662] And their message that night was what?
[time=1664] Look at verse 14, glory to God in the highest and on earth, what?
[time=1670] Say it, church, peace.
[time=1672] This was the message of the coming of the Christ child.
[time=1677] Peace on earth, it says, peace among men with whom he is pleased.
[time=1684] The child born to us, Isaiah nine brings unending peace.
[time=1688] Luke two, his birth was to bring about earthly peace and one day, one day it will because you know and I know in the scriptures teach that one day every knee will what?
[time=1699] Say it and every tongue will what?
[time=1701] And the peace of God and the peace of the Lord and the peace of the king will reign.
[time=1708] But don't forget Romans five.
[time=1711] Romans five, chapter one in Paul's amazing explanation of the gospel in the book of Romans.
[time=1717] He comes to Romans five and he talks about peace.
[time=1720] And here we see this, it says in the first verse of chapter five, it says, "Therefore, having been justified by your faith, "you've been declared righteous by the judge "because of your faith, having been justified by faith, "we have," what, say it, peace with God.
[time=1740] You didn't used to have peace with God.
[time=1742] If you have fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ, today you do, but if you haven't fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ, you are not at peace with God.
[time=1754] The scripture teaches that you are at odds with God.
[time=1760] The scripture teaches that in Romans five, it says we were enemies, it says we were sinners, it says we were without hope.
[time=1766] If you're not in relationship with him, you're at odds with him and there is no peace and you're distant and he's detached and there's trouble.
[time=1775] But because of the Christ of Christmas, because of the work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, the scripture teaches here in Romans five, one, that we have peace, that we are united with, that we are together with.
[time=1791] It's all good, peace with God through Jesus Christ, peace, the ability to accept one's state or circumstance.
[time=1800] It means fulfillment, fulfillment mixed with the absence of anxiety, we'll talk about that later.
[time=1807] And enter, oh, get this, an inner contentment in the face of circumstantial discord.
[time=1814] Oh, I hope you don't miss that.
[time=1816] It is an inner contentment in the face of circumstantial discord.
[time=1824] All of that from faith in Christ.
[time=1826] Faith leads to an acceptance of one's state.
[time=1829] Faith leads to fulfillment and the absence of anxiety.
[time=1832] Faith leads to a contentment in the face of circumstantial discord.
[time=1837] This is yours.
[time=1839] You get to have this, you get to live this peace.
[time=1843] You can have it, you can experience it, you can live with it when you are transformed into a follower of the prince of peace.
[time=1853] When you lay down your life, really, lay down your life and truly embrace the Christ of Christmas.
[time=1861] Now, I believe there is a great deal of confusion at times when it comes to a real picture of peace and how this works.
[time=1873] I'm gonna need some help here to do this.
[time=1875] We're gonna just take a couple of minutes and I need a gal to come and help me.
[time=1879] Erica Saffton, would you come real quick and would you come and help me?
[time=1883] She's gonna hate me for this, but I could have asked her beforehand, she would have said no, but now what's she gonna say?
[time=1888] No?
[time=1889] So welcome, Erica, up here, come on, Erica.
[time=1893] Hand me that bathroom.
[time=1895] Okay, so watch this.
[time=1896] Erica, I'm not gonna hurt you.
[time=1898] You will be probably embarrassed somewhat.
[time=1900] I know you already are, but here, watch this.
[time=1902] Good to see you, come on, step up here a little bit.
[time=1905] You're still gonna like me after this.
[time=1907] All right, here, put this on.
[time=1909] So this is what some people, I think sometimes, Chris, can we get a little yawny, a little spa music?
[time=1915] Let's dim the lights a little bit.
[time=1917] Here, back, Erica, let's just do a little candle here.
[time=1919] See, sometimes people, oh you like that.
[time=1922] So I think sometimes people think that peace is like, you know, here, there you go.
[time=1929] That looks kind of peaceful, doesn't it?
[time=1931] Yeah, so hold on to that.
[time=1932] So I think sometimes people think that peace is sometimes, hang on to that first thing there, Tim.
[time=1938] Let's do this.
[time=1939] I'm gonna put a little water and see, this is perrier water.
[time=1942] This isn't just normal water.
[time=1944] This is like perrier water.
[time=1945] We're gonna put that there and then up.
[time=1948] We got some oranges, you know?
[time=1950] I mean, I think some people, you're not really gonna drink it or I wouldn't have touched it with my hands, but there's that.
[time=1956] So then we got the orange water, then here, there you go.
[time=1959] Right there, that's gonna hold that.
[time=1961] And then, I think some people think if we can just get into kind of a relaxed state, somehow that's what peace is.
[time=1967] See, this is like the hot thing that goes around the neck.
[time=1970] Like that, how you feeling?
[time=1971] Feeling relaxed?
[time=1973] Yeah, good.
[time=1974] And then we've got the cool little leopard skin eye patch.
[time=1978] See where you're just gonna do this right here?
[time=1979] Don't know, don't hate me now.
[time=1980] See, here we go.
[time=1981] There we go, can you, you can still see that?
[time=1984] All right, so see, don't be confused though.
[time=1988] 'Cause as unbelievable as this looks, and as relaxing as this might be, there's a lot of people who could be doing all this, but not be peaceful.
[time=1997] Now watch this, I'm gonna take this.
[time=1998] Okay, now you can see, oh, now you can see again.
[time=2002] Sorry, okay guys, take this away.
[time=2003] Now watch this.
[time=2005] That isn't necessarily, you can take the robe off.
[time=2008] There we go, that isn't necessarily peace.
[time=2011] Here's what I want you to realize, thank you.
[time=2014] We're gonna take the robe, no, you're not done.
[time=2017] Okay, put on the oven mitt.
[time=2019] There's the oven mitt, and Erica, you're gonna start to hear some sounds here that may sound familiar here.
[time=2026] Actually, here's a little duster right there, and I've got the apron.
[time=2030] Here's a basket of laundry, does that look familiar?
[time=2034] Yeah, it does, so there's that.
[time=2037] My wife was here first hour, and she said, "For goodness sake, Kelly, dump the laundry on the ground." So there's the dump laundry, and here's all the toys everywhere, and then you're gonna start hearing some sounds.
[time=2049] Sounds that might sound familiar to you, right?
[time=2054] So stand up here.
[time=2055] All right, so.
[time=2056] Smile, just a little.
[time=2060] Yes, see that smile, just a little?
[time=2065] That smile, just a little, because I know Erica, is the presence of peace.
[time=2071] Because even though all this is going on, even though all this is going on on the outside, peace is an inner contentment in the face of external discord, and it is generated because of what's inside our heart.
[time=2086] And when you embrace the Christ of Christmas, when you fully surrender your heart and life to Christ, it can all be going down into the left quickly, but there is an ability to stand in the midst of whatever's going on with a sense of it's gonna be okay.
[time=2104] Peace, give Erica a big hand.
[time=2106] You can take all your great stuff off there, well done.
[time=2109] Very well done.
[time=2112] (audience applauding) An inner contentment, do you have that?
[time=2117] Does that describe you?
[time=2119] Is this how you're functioning?
[time=2121] Is this how you're facing life?
[time=2124] Let me say something, let me say one more thing.
[time=2127] It's very true about peace before we move on to the second point.
[time=2132] Let me say to you something this morning that in this day and age of ours will sound preposterous to some of you.
[time=2142] There are those in the room, as I say this to you, based upon what you've been told, based upon your experience, based upon what you've read, based upon maybe just what we've accepted, we'll think this is ridiculous, but it's not.
[time=2160] You don't have to be anxious.
[time=2168] Let me say that to you again.
[time=2169] Your life doesn't have to be governed by anxiety.
[time=2174] Your life doesn't have to be run by the anxious thoughts
[time=2181] of this life and your experience in it.
[time=2184] Now, I understand, believe me, I understand that there are doctors and specialists that you can go to and I can go to, and they can diagnose it, because I understand there are times when we experience things in life.
[time=2202] Sometimes when we were young, sometimes when we're old, I know things happen that can prompt us toward those feelings of anxiety,
[time=2213] things being out of control, those feelings of deep concern, I get that.
[time=2219] I know that there are medications that can numb it to a degree.
[time=2224] I understand that there are processes you can go through that can assist you in the navigating of those feelings.
[time=2232] I am here to tell you that at the end of the day, at a very fundamental level, the Christ of Christmas, when embraced, gives you the opportunity to experience peace.
[time=2243] It is a peace that surpasses all, what, understanding.
[time=2250] It is a peace that is deep.
[time=2252] It is a peace that is thorough.
[time=2254] It is a peace that is from God and the only way you ever get to experience it is through Christ.
[time=2263] In a fully surrendered, fully devoted relationship with Him,
[time=2269] all that leads us toward anxiety, which is very real.
[time=2274] Please don't hear me wrong, very real.
[time=2277] All of it, when it meets up with the power of the Spirit of God and the Son of God and the Word of God, can be conquered.
[time=2287] John 16, I love John 1633.
[time=2290] You'd have thought it just got written for this message.
[time=2293] It says in John 1633, these things I've spoken to you so that in me you may have what?
[time=2299] Peace in the world, in the world you will have anxiety.
[time=2305] In the world you will have tribulation.
[time=2308] In the world stuff's gonna happen.
[time=2310] It has the potential to just wreck you emotionally and mentally, but Jesus says, but take courage.
[time=2318] Don't go there.
[time=2319] Don't be overcome by it.
[time=2321] Stand and courage, why?
[time=2322] Because I, not you, I, have overcome the world and when you have Him, you have the overcomer.
[time=2329] When you have Him, you have peace.
[time=2332] Amen, your future can be characterized by peace.
[time=2336] Your future can also be filled with purpose.
[time=2339] I hope you'll write that down.
[time=2340] Your future can be filled with purpose, a reason.
[time=2343] My friends are real, compelling reason to live, to go forward, to keep at it.
[time=2348] There's too many Christians aimlessly, in my opinion, too many Christians today aimlessly, just going to work.
[time=2355] What are you doing?
[time=2356] I go to work.
[time=2357] What's your life about?
[time=2358] I go here.
[time=2359] I mean, what are you really into?
[time=2361] Why just do this?
[time=2362] Too many Christians today aimlessly just paying a mortgage.
[time=2367] It's not what God called you to do.
[time=2370] This isn't the transcendent calling that He's placed on your life.
[time=2373] I'm thankful you're a doctor.
[time=2375] I'm thankful you're a factory worker.
[time=2376] I'm thankful that you're a waitress.
[time=2378] I'm glad you teach.
[time=2379] I'm thankful you coach.
[time=2380] Wherever you go for 40 or 50 hours, God bless you.
[time=2383] That's a good thing, but it's not what you were made for.
[time=2387] If you know the Lord, if you fully surrendered your heart and life to Him, He has given you a mission.
[time=2392] Now, let's look at it this way.
[time=2396] If there's no Jesus, if there's no virgin birth, if there's no Emmanuel, no Christmas Christ, no Savior, Redeemer or Lord, in other words, if sin still rules, if death still reigns, if the enemy resides on the throne and not Christ, then all of this, all of this, all this Christmas stuff is absolutely a waste and there is no greater purpose.
[time=2419] But thank God, everybody say thank God.
[time=2423] Thank God there was a virgin birth, amen?
[time=2427] Historically, it's recorded.
[time=2430] Joseph and Mary really checked into Bethlehem.
[time=2433] King Herod really did flip out because Magi really did speak of a new king's birth.
[time=2437] A Savior really was born.
[time=2439] Messiah really did come and God so loved the world that He really did send His only begotten son.
[time=2447] And here it is, here it is, don't miss this.
[time=2450] With the birth of God's son came the mission of God's son, a divine purpose that Jesus would infuse
[time=2462] into each and every single person who would follow and trust Him completely.
[time=2468] That's how it got designed.
[time=2472] That's how the whole thing got put together, that He would come on this mission to redeem and restore.
[time=2478] And those who would follow Him would be infused with that very same mission.
[time=2485] Oh, it is the greatest mission of all and it should absolutely consume you.
[time=2492] I fear it doesn't.
[time=2500] It doesn't consume me as much as it should.
[time=2504] But this mission is purpose.
[time=2510] Oh, here it is, personal participation.
[time=2514] It's unbelievable, personal participation in the advancement of God's kingdom.
[time=2520] I mean, go to work, good, but do this.
[time=2525] Personal participation in the advancement of God's kingdom, God's redeeming kingdom, God's life-saving kingdom.
[time=2532] That's right, you get to help divinely, eternally rescue and restore people.
[time=2540] Your heart should leap.
[time=2543] You should get like all fired up when you hear Ryan stand here and say that he walked through the doors on Easter in a church that you're a part of and that we're giving ourselves to in his life and his family's life, God forever altered.
[time=2559] I mean, it should absolutely thrill you.
[time=2561] I fear sometimes it doesn't.
[time=2564] You get to make a really big deal about God.
[time=2571] While making disciples of his son, it should absolutely stir you.
[time=2577] I fear sometimes it doesn't.
[time=2579] When you embrace the Christ of Christmas, your future includes a transcendent daily moment by moment purpose.
[time=2591] I've used that word transcendent a couple of times.
[time=2594] You know what it means, don't you?
[time=2595] Transcendent is something above and beyond you.
[time=2599] It's something bigger than you.
[time=2601] It's something way beyond your gift mix.
[time=2603] It's something way beyond your talent.
[time=2605] It's something you couldn't ever even dream of being a part of, were it not for the grace of God that has allowed you to be a part of something that is so special and so big and so divine.
[time=2617] It should really, really, it should make your day, it should consume your thoughts.
[time=2623] It should stir your soul.
[time=2624] I fear sometimes it doesn't.
[time=2627] This is a most important thing in the world type mission
[time=2635] and you and I get to carry it out.
[time=2637] Corbin Miller wrote me a note the last night we were together in Poland.
[time=2644] He gave it to me, slipped it to me as I left for the airport that next day.
[time=2650] And I thought his words at the end of his note captured this so powerfully.
[time=2655] He says at the end, "Then Kelly, please, tell the Black Hawk family to never grow weary of proclaiming and sharing the gospel.
[time=2665] Encourage them, Kelly, to spread the good news now, today more than ever, the end is near.
[time=2672] And the fields are ready for the harvest.
[time=2674] May all of Black Hawk be found faithful in this greatest endeavor of all." Christmas is about the past.
[time=2684] The birth of Jesus ushers and the one who redeems and restores us from our past.
[time=2689] Christmas is about our present, our today, the birth of Jesus embracing the Christ of Christmas allows me to live today in obedience and devotion like we talked about last week, like Mary did and Joseph did and Jesus did.
[time=2702] And Christmas, my friends, is about our future.
[time=2706] Christmas provides a peaceful, a peaceful future and a purpose in life worth living for.
[time=2715] I wanna ask Lonnie, heck, if he'd come up, I wanna have you hear one more story this morning, a story that captures the work of Christ and the life of one of our own here.
[time=2726] As Lonnie shares, you'll sense and see Christmas Christ at work in his past and his present, but all listen, as he talks about where God's leading him toward his future.
[time=2739] And I'm so grateful these guys were willing to share today.
[time=2742] Listen, this morning and be encouraged.
[time=2745] - Hello, when I was asked to share how Christ has made a difference in my life and transformed my future, I began to think of one word.
[time=2753] I thought of the word free.
[time=2757] I'm free, my future is filled with freedom.
[time=2760] I'm free to boldly tell others of Christ's forgiveness.
[time=2765] I'm free to live one day at a time.
[time=2767] I'm free to give Christ all the glory of how you transform my future.
[time=2770] But for years, my lustful heart robbed me of Christ's freedom.
[time=2775] Freedom felt so far away.
[time=2777] I traded freedom with Christ for the bondage of shame, guilt, darkness, and destruction.
[time=2783] I knew Christ, but for so long, life just went on as usual for me.
[time=2786] I had Christ, but had no clue what freedom looked like.
[time=2791] Old sin simply festered in my new skin.
[time=2793] And instead of growing and changing in Christ, I simply became a Greyhound dog, always racing around that track, trying to catch that rabbit of sin.
[time=2803] Yet, my God is good.
[time=2805] In four years ago, he pointed me to celebrate recovery.
[time=2807] And my future changed.
[time=2809] I found hope.
[time=2811] I found a safe place to reveal the real me.
[time=2815] Freedom wasn't a faraway dream anymore.
[time=2818] It was finally a reality.
[time=2819] Through the structure of CR, my eyes were open wide to Christ's mercy, Christ's grace, Christ's forgiveness and love.
[time=2827] CR has ignited in me a desire to know, obey, and trust him completely.
[time=2832] I desire to have Christ saturate me so that when others walk into my celebrate recovery meeting, they might experience Jesus' power to redeem them.
[time=2842] I mentioned my future change through CR, so what changed about my future?
[time=2847] Two thanks.
[time=2848] First, my marriage is alive.
[time=2850] It's free from the bondage of hiding my sin.
[time=2854] I no longer dread the truth, wondering if my wife will find out the sins of my past or present.
[time=2861] I am free to reveal the dark, scary truth.
[time=2865] I'll never know how deep those wounds go.
[time=2867] I inflicted on my wife.
[time=2869] Her forgiveness of me or slowly trusting me, her willingness to be married and rebuilt is a testament to Jesus alone.
[time=2877] Christ slowly healed our marriage and his mercies have kept us marriage.
[time=2881] And we will be for years to come and into the future.
[time=2885] Second, my future holds many open,
[time=2891] honest conversations with my three little boys.
[time=2893] My little men will not be blind to the destruction of my past sins wrecked.
[time=2899] My sons will know God's truth and how he restored my heart.
[time=2905] I know Christ healed me of my sins in order to repair my future family tree.
[time=2908] You see, Christ who's my past and present to not only change my future but my sons.
[time=2914] The cycle of generational sin and addiction in my family was forever altered by Christ.
[time=2920] A new course has been set for my children and my children's children.
[time=2925] Someday, in the future, one of my grandkids will say, grandpa, why does our family tree have that scar?
[time=2935] Well, a little one, that's a reminder when Christ set me free.
[time=2940] You see, little one in Romans 11, 17, it says some of the branches were broken off and I, your grandpa, although a wild olive chute, was grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree.
[time=2955] And in the gospel, John, he goes on to say in 15, two, that he cut off every branch in grandpa that bore no fruit and every branch that did, he pruned so it'll be ever more fruitful.
[time=2966] My little one would probably say, did it hurt grandpa?
[time=2971] What little one, being grafted in and pruned?
[time=2975] Did it hurt?
[time=2976] Yeah, baby, the pruning hurt and that scar took a long time to heal but that scar reminds me of the first Peter 29, that I am to proclaim the excellencies of him who call grandpa out of darkness into Christ's marvelous life.
[time=2996] Thank you.
[time=2997] (audience applauding)
[time=3014] [MUSIC - 518 seconds]
[time=3562] You
