[time=30] >> Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast, it's great to have you with us, and I want to say a happy new year to each and every one of you.
[time=41] We are welcoming in 2014 with a new tradition at Black Hawk over the last several years.
[time=48] We have kind of dedicated the month of January to a teaching series.
[time=52] Every year we start the year with a teaching series on the family.
[time=56] That's right, we believe the family, God's design for the family is something that is absolutely foundational to our faith, to our homes, to our futures.
[time=68] We believe it has a significant impact on our culture and our world, and we want the family.
[time=74] Whatever yours looks like, whatever mine looks like, we want the family to be God honoring.
[time=79] We want it to function in ways that he designed, and we believe when that's happening, when families are living and functioning in the way that God designed them to, we think great, great things can happen.
[time=92] And so this month, as you see on the screen, a new series we're calling Real Men.
[time=98] Men play such an important role in the life of a family.
[time=102] And as do women and as do kids, obviously, but this month we're going to focus on the role of a man, a man and his relationship with his God, a man and his relationship with his wife, a man and his relationship with kids and family, all of it, something that we think is incredibly important.
[time=122] So I want to invite you men and women, you families, to come and be a part of this. We're going to talk about how real men really do some things that make a difference, real men love, and real men lead, and real men serve, and men who are really men the way God designed them to, they sanctify, they spiritually help grow their families.
[time=145] And at the end of the series, our last Sunday, we're going to talk about how real men overcome all the challenges that they face because of their relationship with Christ.
[time=156] I hope you'll join us. It's going to be a great month. Real men and God's designed for them in the scope of the family, and I can't wait to see what God's going to teach you.
[time=166] I can't wait to see what he's going to teach me, and I can't wait for us to experience this new series together. God bless you, and as always, we hope to see you soon.

[time=569] Well, good morning from No Man's Land here.
[time=573] We're after Christmas before New Year, so what do we say to each other?
[time=576] We don't say Merry Christmas, we don't say Happy New Year, both seem a little inappropriate.
[time=580] I was talking to Candice all wine at the welcome ceremony this morning and she said why don't you say "Marinatha"?
[time=586] I said okay. Well, "Marinatha" is a little word at the very end of 1 Corinthians, which means something like "Lord, come."
[time=595] So let's all say that word together. You can take it or leave it, but here we go.
[time=599] "Marinatha" means "Lord, come." It's a little Aramaic word, so that's for you.
[time=604] What to say next couple of days before New Year's come.
[time=607] New Year's Day you can say Happy New Year, but for now you can say "Marinatha" you're welcome.
[time=613] Okay. We were in Ohio in recent days glad to be back, to be with you.
[time=620] I was here for Christmas Eve services and what an amazing night that was.
[time=625] I hope you had a very Merry Christmas indeed.
[time=629] One of my favorite quotes is this.
[time=632] "The only thing worse than nostalgia is amnesia." So we've got to be careful about looking back too much or looking back not enough.
[time=642] We've got to kind of strike that balance this morning, so I encourage you with this look back at 2013.
[time=648] This is what we've talked about this year here at Blackhawk.
[time=652] I'm so grateful for the year that we had.
[time=655] You saw on the screen in front of you behind me that we're going to do another series for families.
[time=661] It's called Real Men, but it's for all people, real men, and women are interested.
[time=666] I think in what a man should be like, so that will be for everybody.
[time=669] No one is excluded from those messages coming in January.
[time=672] We begin the year with a series for families because families matter and they're important.
[time=676] It's the last of your story with modern families.
[time=679] We talked about genealogy.
[time=680] We talked about what God says about roles to play in families, and it is a terrifying thing to have a teenager living in your house.
[time=688] We're on the verge of one at my house, and I'm praying more than I've ever prayed ever before.
[time=694] After modern families talked about Ruth, this little beautiful story tucked away in the Old Testament, and there are three words that show now to us in that story.
[time=704] One was sovereignty, the gods of control of all things, more on that later.
[time=709] In other words, providence that God isn't only in control of all things, but He acts for our good day by day, and then the word redemption, that God is working salvation for people every day all the time.
[time=722] All that little story, that little beautiful short story of Ruth and what we call the Old Testament.
[time=727] Then first John.
[time=728] First John is a famously succinct letter.
[time=733] By that I mean this, that it just gets right to the point.
[time=735] Phrases like God is love, God is light, in Him there is no darkness at all.
[time=742] First John 3 16 says that we know what love is because Jesus Christ laid down His life for the brothers.
[time=749] So first John offers us this remarkable insight into a person that John knew well, namely Jesus.
[time=756] Out of first John into a series called Jesus According to Jesus, it was look at the I am statements of Jesus.
[time=764] I am the resurrection and the life.
[time=766] I am the way, the truth and the life.
[time=768] I am the good shepherd.
[time=770] I believe, dear friends, that the Bible primarily is about God making Himself known to us.
[time=776] That's why we have the Bible.
[time=777] So we can know what God is like, what God thinks about, what God thinks of you, what God thinks of Himself in the world, all these things.
[time=784] And so what better place to settle than a whole series of statements that what God says in the person of Christ about Himself.
[time=791] That was a wonderful time together.
[time=793] Then to a vision series where we launched, we didn't launch, we recast that vision together of five elements
[time=802] of three initiatives of gathering, connecting and going.
[time=806] I cannot wait for 2014 and what God has in store for us.
[time=811] I've never been more proud to be part of this place.
[time=815] We'll talk about that in the minutes to come in the service about what's coming in 2014, but I'm very, very excited about gathering, connecting and going.
[time=824] What a wonderful thing.
[time=825] Then unspeakable kindness, a little journey through the parable of the Good Samaritan.
[time=830] We ended that time with Josh Rang, member of our teaching team, and framing Christ as the great Samaritan, the one who loved us and gave Himself for us,
[time=841] and really of His own gracious mercy.
[time=846] This is who God is.
[time=847] And then in December, we've been talking about coming and adoring Him.
[time=851] Come with us, adore Him, Christ the Lord.
[time=853] In the past, we've been in a remarkable journey over the last several years of giving at Christmas time.
[time=858] More on that later too.
[time=860] In the present, what's going on in the current time and what's coming in the future.
[time=863] Past, present and future adoring of Him.
[time=866] We use those words when we sing.
[time=868] And if those words are unfamiliar to you, that's okay.
[time=871] The Bible sings out this message that God loves people and that God wants people to love Him in return.
[time=879] So it's good for us to sing those words this morning, even if they're unfamiliar to you.
[time=883] It's good that we sing them over you and with you and together.
[time=887] It's always good.
[time=888] God is a God who loves.
[time=890] God is love.
[time=891] And so He wants us to love Him in return.
[time=894] And He has offered us this remarkable expression of love at Christmas time in the baby, in the manger.
[time=903] We're going to be in Hebrews 2 this morning.
[time=905] I invite you to go there as we begin.
[time=908] And I want to read these first four verses of Hebrew 2 sort of as a prologue to where we're actually going to talk about this morning.
[time=914] Hebrews 2 verses 1 through 4.
[time=917] It's not surprising to you friends to learn that the Bible is filled up with calls to remember
[time=923] or warnings like, "Don't forget." And I need those things.
[time=927] I need them on my phone.
[time=928] I need sticky notes.
[time=929] I need bookmarks.
[time=930] I need sharpies on my hand.
[time=932] I need all kinds of stuff to remember things.
[time=934] I'm prone to forget.
[time=936] Look at what it says in Hebrews 2 verse 1.
[time=940] "Therefore, we must pay much closer attention to what we've heard,
[time=946] lest we drift away from it.
[time=949] As the message declared by angels proved to be reliable in every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution." Let's define some words.
[time=959] Transgression.
[time=960] That means there's a line and I cross it.
[time=962] It's a word that means trespass.
[time=964] Same word.
[time=965] A just retribution means that you get in return what you deserve.
[time=969] So that can be a scary thing or a really encouraging thing at the same time.
[time=973] Verse 3, Hebrews 2.
[time=975] "How shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?" It was declared at first by the Lord, speaking of Jesus here, and was attested to us by those who heard, while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will.
[time=995] We have to pay close attention.
[time=997] We have received this reliable message.
[time=1000] Amen?
[time=1001] The message that we have received is reliable.
[time=1004] It's God's estimation of His own word.
[time=1007] It's reliable.
[time=1008] It's a great salvation offered to us.
[time=1011] So I encourage you with that, friends, as we begin from Hebrews chapter 2.
[time=1015] If you look back at 2013, maybe you're glad it's gone.
[time=1019] I don't know what the year has held for you.
[time=1022] Maybe you'll sing Old Lang Zion in a few days with great joy in your heart and all acquaintance be forgot.
[time=1029] Let's do that.
[time=1030] Let's get away from all those things.
[time=1031] I don't know where you stand or sit this morning.
[time=1034] I encourage you with this.
[time=1035] The God is already in the new year, and from the Book of Ruth and forever more, the God's able to redeem whatever brokenness that you've experienced in the days that have come behind you.
[time=1045] I encourage you with that this morning.
[time=1048] All right.
[time=1049] Do you guys watch any Christmas movies this past week?
[time=1051] They were ubiquitous.
[time=1052] They were everywhere in TV.
[time=1054] Do you guys watch any Christmas movies?
[time=1056] Raise your hands.
[time=1057] Come on, don't be shy.
[time=1058] Turn your Christmas sweeties coma.
[time=1060] I bet you are.
[time=1061] Your food coma after Christmas.
[time=1063] Wake up.
[time=1064] I watched.
[time=1065] It's a wonderful life.
[time=1066] If you haven't watched that movie, you need to watch it.
[time=1069] Like today.
[time=1070] Like go find it somewhere.
[time=1072] That's a great movie.
[time=1074] Another great Christmas movie is, I think it's called the Charlie Brown Christmas.
[time=1077] That's the name of it.
[time=1078] Do you guys familiar with this?
[time=1079] Nothing like cartoons and smooth jazz.
[time=1082] Nothing like those two things.
[time=1083] Two great tastes.
[time=1084] Tastes great together.
[time=1085] Cartoons and smooth jazz.
[time=1088] Love it.
[time=1089] Charlie Brown is a ne'er-do-well character.
[time=1093] You guys are like Charlie Brown's a blockhead.
[time=1095] He gets bullied by his peers mercilessly.
[time=1098] They're so terrible at Charlie Brown.
[time=1100] You ever notice that?
[time=1101] Things you notice as you get older.
[time=1102] These kids are terrible at Charlie Brown.
[time=1104] Charlie Brown can't find something to do.
[time=1106] He feels purposeless at Christmas time.
[time=1109] So Lucy, that ever helpful.
[time=1112] Lucy says, "Hey Charlie Brown, why don't you direct the Christmas play?" He goes, "Really?" Okay.
[time=1118] So Linus and the gang gather in this amazing elementary school and have this Christmas play.
[time=1124] And no one listens to Charlie Brown.
[time=1126] The whole thing is a disaster.
[time=1127] It's coming unwound all around him.
[time=1129] He's in despair, right?
[time=1131] This chaos all around him.
[time=1133] And he goes, "Isn't there anyone that knows what Christmas is all about?" Remember this?
[time=1138] Remember this?
[time=1139] Okay.
[time=1140] Enter the hero.
[time=1141] Linus with his blanket.
[time=1143] And Linus goes, "Sure, Charlie Brown.
[time=1146] I can't think of Christmas it's all about." And he quotes Luke too.
[time=1150] The whole thing all the way through, it's absolutely stunning.
[time=1152] Everything just stops.
[time=1154] Linus is in the middle of stage spotlight on him.
[time=1157] Everything just kind of gets quiet.
[time=1159] All this chaos.
[time=1160] And everything else in the story is different after that moment.
[time=1164] Because Charlie Brown knows, maybe he remembers what Christmas is really all about.
[time=1169] Not all this crazy Christmas play nonsense they're having to worry about.
[time=1174] But the baby in the manger.
[time=1177] I hope that this morning, friends, is an encouragement to you.
[time=1181] That in all the chaos of your life, that you can settle in on this little quiet scene.
[time=1188] The little town of Bethlehem.
[time=1189] One more time before we leave it in the rearview mirror, Christmas altogether.
[time=1193] Maybe your tree's still up.
[time=1194] That's good.
[time=1195] It's a good thing.
[time=1196] So when you go home and see your tree today, I hope these things ring in your ears.
[time=1200] They're emblazoned on your mind that you remember what we talked about this morning.
[time=1205] Can I pray one more time before we begin?
[time=1209] Heavenly Father, may the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing to you and in your sight.
[time=1215] God, you are our rock.
[time=1216] You are our Redeemer.
[time=1218] May we see you in clearer focus, God, at the end of our time together today.
[time=1224] That's my prayer, God.
[time=1225] And we pray that altogether in Jesus' name.
[time=1228] [AMEN] Hebrews chapter two and verse five, there are notes in your bulletin.
[time=1233] There's an outline there.
[time=1234] I'd love for you to follow along if you want to.
[time=1235] There are a whole bunch of references in there for you to go back and visit during the course of the week if you want to.
[time=1241] This passage has all kinds of threads that go all over the Bible back to the Old Testament forward and all the rest of it.
[time=1247] So I encourage you with that this morning.
[time=1251] Hebrews two, reading from verse five.
[time=1253] I'm going to read through the end of the chapter, Hebrews chapter two.
[time=1257] Would you all stand with me as I read from Hebrews chapter two this morning?
[time=1260] It's the last time I'll ask you to stand.
[time=1262] Somebody else might ask you to stand.
[time=1263] Last time I'm going to ask you to stand.
[time=1265] Okay, all right.
[time=1266] Here we go.
[time=1269] For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking.
[time=1276] It's been testified somewhere.
[time=1277] What is man that you're mindful of him or the son of man that you care for him?
[time=1281] You made him a little while lower than the angels.
[time=1284] You've crowned him with glory and honor, putting everything in subjection under his feet.
[time=1291] Now, putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control.
[time=1296] At present, we don't yet see everything in subjection to him, but we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus.
[time=1305] Crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God, he might taste death for everyone.
[time=1315] It was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering.
[time=1326] For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source.
[time=1336] I will tell of your name to my brothers.
[time=1338] In the midst of the congregation, I will sing your praise.
[time=1341] And again, I will put my trust in him.
[time=1344] And again, behold, I and the children God has given me.
[time=1349] Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things.
[time=1355] That through death, he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery, verse 16.
[time=1367] For surely it's not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham.
[time=1372] Therefore, he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
[time=1383] For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
[time=1390] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=1392] There are three questions, dear friends, thank you for standing with me, hovering over our time together in Hebrews 2.
[time=1398] The first question is this in your notes.
[time=1400] The first question is who is Jesus.
[time=1404] I am impressed that there might not be a more important question than that that you will ever have to answer in your life.
[time=1412] If you have the wrong idea about Jesus, it has eternal consequences.
[time=1419] If you're in the packers side of the fence or the bearers side of the fence, that doesn't have eternal significance.
[time=1425] You might think it does today, but it doesn't.
[time=1430] Our right understanding of Jesus is of eternal significance, and so I'm glad that Hebrews 2 has a lot to say about him and about his identity, his character, his nature, even.
[time=1441] Look at verse 5 of Hebrews 2.
[time=1445] Who is Jesus?
[time=1446] It wasn't to angels that God subjected the world to come.
[time=1451] The author of Hebrews has taken the whole first chapter into the second to describe how he is greater than the angels, greater than anyone else.
[time=1458] It's ever lived greater than the patriarchs, greater than the angels, greater than anyone.
[time=1463] That it all narrows up to Jesus. This is God's estimation, God's assessment of Jesus is that there is no one that never will be anyone greater or better or higher than him.
[time=1477] Turn left to Hebrews 1 in the first few verses.
[time=1482] Look at Hebrews chapter 1 verses 1, 2 and 3. Very, very important.
[time=1489] It says in Hebrews 2 in verse 5 that there is a world to come, follow that away and watch with me here.
[time=1494] Long ago, the author of Hebrews says, "At many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets."
[time=1501] But in these last days, he has spoken to us by his son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.
[time=1512] He is the radiance of the glory of God, the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power.
[time=1523] It's difficult to find a higher picture of Jesus than that.
[time=1528] He is the radiance, friends, of the glory of God. He is the exact imprint. That's a word for a ring that would be put into wax, the exact imprint of God's nature.
[time=1540] He is what God is like. He is God, in flesh, Jesus.
[time=1545] So there's no higher picture of him than I could offer you than the one that the scriptures offer of Jesus.
[time=1550] It says, in these last days, God sent forth his son. The last days began 2,000 years ago, according to the author of Hebrews, when Jesus showed up.
[time=1560] So the world to come has not arrived yet. It's coming. Someday, marinatha, Lord come.
[time=1567] But not yet. We have a little glimpse that we have a little a peek at it.
[time=1571] One day, the clouds will be rolled back like a scroll and all things will be made new again.
[time=1576] It says in the scriptures that if anyone is in Christ, he's a new creation.
[time=1581] The old things have passed away, new things have come. And so every person, watch this.
[time=1586] Every person who is in Christ has a little down payment or guarantee of new creation in life walking around with them everywhere they go.
[time=1595] Isn't that amazing? You like Pigpen in peanuts? Has like a cloud around him? You guys know Pigpen in peanuts?
[time=1602] Has like a cloud of where he goes of just filth, a big pen?
[time=1606] In Christ, we have the Holy Spirit enjoying within us, and we have this new creation in life around us all the time.
[time=1614] It's the opposite of Pigpen. It's the Holy Spirit. Wow. That's profound.
[time=1621] In Hebrews 2, you see there, maybe in your Bibles it has it kind of stuck in the margins there.
[time=1626] You see a little bit there? That's a quote from Psalm 8. It's Psalm 8 verses 4 through 6.
[time=1631] The 4 Psalm 8, 4 through 6 is Psalm 8, 1 through 3. You're welcome.
[time=1637] Okay. It says in Psalm 8, 4 through 6, which the author of Hebrews quotes in Hebrews 2,
[time=1643] that he's amazed that God thinks about man and the son of man that you care for him.
[time=1649] The son of man that says in Hebrews 2 quoting Psalm 8, that everything is in subjection to him under his feet.
[time=1656] We've thought about Psalm 8 in that these verses may be familiar to you. So we're going to go back to Psalm 8 now and read verses 1, 2, and 3 of that Psalm. Listen to what happens in that Psalm before the what is man's stuff.
[time=1668] Listen. O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[time=1675] You have set your glory above the heavens out of the mouth of babies and infants.
[time=1681] You've established strength because of your foes to still the enemy and the avenger.
[time=1685] When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon stars, which you have set in place,
[time=1692] what is man that you are mindful of him. That's the context. Isn't that amazing?
[time=1697] You've been on a far away from the city lights on a clear night.
[time=1701] You can see the millions and myriads and myriads of stars everywhere.
[time=1706] The psalmist had no city lights to contend with.
[time=1709] And so you were not in the night sky and said, I can't believe God that you care about us.
[time=1716] When all this is the work of your fingers, you care about me.
[time=1720] That's an application, friends, out of Hebrews 2. That's for you this morning.
[time=1725] Everything has been put in subjection to Jesus under his feet, but he is not too significant to remember you.
[time=1732] To think about you. He knows your name. He knows your struggle. He knows your pain.
[time=1738] It's amazing to me how often I read accounts of very famous people.
[time=1742] And what makes the biggest impression on people often is how down-to-earth they are.
[time=1748] That's so amazing. They have no reason to be down-to-earth, but they are.
[time=1753] It may not surprise you to know that Jesus Christ is the most down-to-earth great person who has ever lived.
[time=1762] That's with the incarnation that God became a man. That's what it's about. Wow.
[time=1767] The Son of Man that he talks about in Hebrews 2 is Jesus.
[time=1772] It says in Daniel 7 that the Son of Man was given glory and the kingdom that will never come to an end.
[time=1778] It's an amazing picture of the Son of Man. It was his favorite title, Jesus, of himself in the gospels.
[time=1784] Son of Man, remarkable stuff. It says, look at this, in verse 8, please don't miss this.
[time=1794] Now in putting everything in subjection to him, that's really friends, the great clue as to who is Jesus in your notes.
[time=1804] Who is Jesus? He is the one to whom everything is in subjection.
[time=1809] And everything there is everything. There's no higher picture. I could give you of these things.
[time=1815] Nothing is outside of his control.
[time=1819] I'm going to ask you to repeat that with me one second. Nothing is outside his control. One more time.
[time=1825] Nothing is outside his control. I know it's hard to believe that.
[time=1832] I know it is. I watch the news like you.
[time=1836] Maybe the Christmas holidays, everything seems out of control all the time.
[time=1840] Your life is probably very chaotic from time to time.
[time=1844] And so it seems like all things under his control, like I don't see it, maybe you don't.
[time=1850] 2 Corinthians 5 says that we walk by faith and not by sight.
[time=1854] Sometimes what I see betrays the truth.
[time=1858] Don't be a prisoner of friends of your circumstances.
[time=1861] Have God's point of view about your life and about the world around us.
[time=1866] Don't forget. It says in verse 9 that we see him.
[time=1870] So seeing Christ is enough to make sense of the world.
[time=1875] It's spinning off its axis sometimes. Everything is under his control.
[time=1881] Nothing is outside his control. I hope you believe that this morning, friends.
[time=1885] That's a gift for the new year you can give yourself every day.
[time=1889] Repeat to yourself. Memorize Hebrews chapter 2 in verse 8.
[time=1893] He left nothing outside his control. Write it on a card.
[time=1897] Put it in your car. Put it on the mirror in your bathroom.
[time=1900] So you see everywhere you go and remember it all the time.
[time=1903] We are prone to forget.
[time=1906] We must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, unless we drift away from it.
[time=1910] That's a tendency for me all the time. Nothing outside his control.
[time=1915] Believe it, friends. Believe it above your circumstances.
[time=1918] I know it's hard. Ask him to help you. Faith is a gift from God.
[time=1923] Ask him to give it to you. God, when walked by faith and not by sight, that's hard for me.
[time=1929] You can't scare God with your prayers. Be honest with him.
[time=1933] He loves you. He gave himself for you.
[time=1937] So believe it, friends. Walk by faith, not by sight.
[time=1941] Everything in subjection to Jesus. Nothing outside his control.
[time=1946] That's who Jesus is. What an amazing picture.
[time=1952] Matthew 28, 18. This is also in your notes, that reference.
[time=1956] He says of himself before he commissions them to go into all the world and make disciples.
[time=1960] He says, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
[time=1966] Wow. That's Jesus according to Jesus. That's who he is.
[time=1971] So when it says that nothing is outside his control and that's who he is, He's comforted by that. Much more comfort to come.
[time=1979] Look at Philippians 2 verses 9 and 10. Familiar verses to you.
[time=1984] Therefore, God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him Philippians 2, 9 and 10,
[time=1990] and bestowed on him the name that is above every name.
[time=1993] At the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth, under the earth. Every name everywhere. That's who Jesus is.
[time=2002] Christmas friends, it's about this great topsy-turvy reality. Let me explain.
[time=2007] Christ made himself nothing which leads to his highest exaltation.
[time=2013] Because of the suffering of death, he was crowned with glory and honor.
[time=2018] Look at verse 9 with me again.
[time=2021] We see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death.
[time=2029] It's a strange combination, but there it is.
[time=2032] That by the grace of God, he might taste death for everyone.
[time=2037] Verse 10, keep going.
[time=2040] It was fitting. It was right. It was only right that he, this is God now, for human by whom all things exist in bringing many sons to glory.
[time=2050] We'll sing that in just a minute. Many sons brought to glory.
[time=2053] Should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering.
[time=2059] Christ is the founder of our salvation. Salvation offered on God's terms.
[time=2065] Who loves us with an everlasting love.
[time=2068] We have nothing to offer him and no chance of meeting his expectations.
[time=2073] That's why he came down to us. That's why Christ came down to earth, literally.
[time=2080] He's fitting. It was the only way and he's done it.
[time=2083] He's already done it. And all you have to do is come into agreement with what God has done.
[time=2089] I believe that what God has done is enough for my salvation.
[time=2093] And your life will never be the same. Never be the same.
[time=2096] Your eternity will be altered because of that.
[time=2100] It's a remarkable thing. That's what Christmas is all about.
[time=2105] Athanasius was a great saint and hero of the faith late third, fourth centuries.
[time=2112] And this is his perspective on this passage.
[time=2115] I thought it was really helpful. I'll share it with you.
[time=2118] But what God did.
[time=2120] What was God to do in the face of the dehumanizing, he said, of mankind.
[time=2124] What a beautiful phrase.
[time=2126] This universal hiding of the knowledge of himself.
[time=2130] So burdened were men with their wickedness. They seemed rather to be brute beasts than reasonable men.
[time=2138] Flicking the very likeness of the word. What then was God to do?
[time=2142] What else could he possibly do? Being God, but renew his image in mankind.
[time=2148] That through it, men once more come to know him.
[time=2153] And how could this be done? Saved by the coming of the very image himself, our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=2160] Men had turned from the contemplation of God above.
[time=2164] And we're looking for him in two opposite directions.
[time=2167] Down among created things and things of sense. Things that you can see and taste and touch.
[time=2173] The Savior of us all, the word of God, in his great love took to himself a body
[time=2180] and moved as man among men meeting their senses, so to speak, half way.
[time=2187] He became himself an object for the senses that those who were seeking God in sensible things
[time=2193] might apprehend the Father through the works which he, the word of God, did in the body.
[time=2201] What an amazing story that is of God becoming a man at Christmastime.
[time=2206] So, who's Jesus? He is one to whom everything is in subjection.
[time=2211] He is the word become flesh. God with us, a manual. That's what it means.
[time=2217] What a wonderful thing to remember.
[time=2219] Number two, in your notes, coming after the first question, who's Jesus?
[time=2224] Second question, who are you? To get to the point, who are you?
[time=2230] Listen to this language starting again with verse 10.
[time=2234] It was fitting, it was right. The "he" by whom all things exist and bringing many sons to glory should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering.
[time=2243] He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source.
[time=2247] That's why he's not ashamed to call them brothers.
[time=2252] I've been thinking about that for a long, long time.
[time=2257] He is not ashamed to call them brothers.
[time=2261] They're probably our people in your life that you are ashamed to be seen with, to be associated with.
[time=2271] I look back at 2013 in my case, friends, and I see a lot of wreckage behind me that I've caused.
[time=2279] Things I've said, things I've done.
[time=2284] I read in Hebrews 2 that he is not ashamed to call me a brother.
[time=2293] A brother, not an acquaintance, not an associate, a brother, but there's more.
[time=2301] I will tell of your name to my brothers in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.
[time=2306] Again, I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children God has given me.
[time=2313] Those three words are words that he uses of those who are in right relationship to God through his son.
[time=2318] They're in your notes, sons, brothers, children.
[time=2324] Some of you have waited your whole lives to be seen and loved and known by somebody in that way.
[time=2332] And you're looking for in all the wrong places.
[time=2335] The only one that can give you that kind of identity is Jesus.
[time=2339] He is the only one and he loves you and only proof you needed that as a cross.
[time=2347] But he loved you and he gave himself for you.
[time=2350] He is not ashamed to call those who aren't ashamed of him brothers.
[time=2357] What a beautiful story and message that is.
[time=2360] He says that to us in Mark 838.
[time=2365] He says, "Whoever is ashamed of me and my words and this adulterous and sinful generation of him will the son of man."
[time=2372] He's that title again.
[time=2373] "Also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his father with the holy angels." This remarkable little phrase tucked away in Philippians 2 says that he endured the cross despising the shame.
[time=2384] You ever heard that phrase before?
[time=2385] You ever thought about it?
[time=2386] You know what it means?
[time=2388] Something like this.
[time=2390] It means that he did not think that the shame he would have to endure was too much for him to bear.
[time=2396] He thought the shame was nothing.
[time=2398] He despised it.
[time=2400] I don't care about the shame I have to endure.
[time=2402] I love these people.
[time=2403] I love you.
[time=2406] I love you so much.
[time=2407] I don't care how shameful it's going to be for me.
[time=2411] I'm going to love him anyway.
[time=2413] Friends, there is no better news out there.
[time=2416] You've been searching a lot of you for a long, long time.
[time=2419] I know you have.
[time=2420] For something else somewhere.
[time=2421] There is no other source.
[time=2423] The prophet Jeremiah calls them broken cisterns that can't give you water.
[time=2428] He's the source of living water that you look for.
[time=2431] You've been looking for, again, your whole life.
[time=2433] He's the answer.
[time=2436] Many sons to glory.
[time=2438] He's not ashamed to call them brothers.
[time=2441] I and the children God has given me.
[time=2445] It's incredible.
[time=2450] God is what Santa Claus pretends to be.
[time=2455] I've said it before.
[time=2456] Forgive me for saying it again, right?
[time=2458] He sees you when you're sleeping.
[time=2459] He knows you're awake.
[time=2462] Everything that you've tried to hide this past year, I have very carefully built walls around
[time=2469] myself and you have to, if you're honest, to hide from people, to keep things secret.
[time=2475] But God knows all those things, those hidden secret things.
[time=2479] And He's not ashamed to call you brother.
[time=2483] He knows you better than you.
[time=2487] Trust His assessment of you through His Son, Jesus.
[time=2492] Don't trust your circumstances or what those voices say to you.
[time=2496] Trust this voice.
[time=2498] The one who authored your salvation, founded your salvation.
[time=2501] Trust Him.
[time=2504] So, in conclusion friends, I was going to say the letter three.
[time=2509] Okay.
[time=2510] Number three.
[time=2511] Third question.
[time=2513] What's Christmas all about?
[time=2515] Charlie Brown.
[time=2516] Isn't there anyone?
[time=2518] Yes, Charlie Brown.
[time=2521] This was right.
[time=2529] Look at these verses.
[time=2531] If you haven't heard anything else I've said this morning, don't miss this.
[time=2536] Some things are almost too good to be true.
[time=2538] This is not one of those things.
[time=2541] Since, therefore, the children's share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise partook
[time=2547] of the same things that through death He might destroy the one who has the power of death.
[time=2553] That is the devil.
[time=2555] And deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.
[time=2562] He already did it.
[time=2566] We live in the wake of it.
[time=2568] He's already defeated the powers of the devil.
[time=2570] He did it already.
[time=2571] Two thousand years are going to meet a mockery of them on the cross.
[time=2574] So what's Christmas all about friends in your notes that says this?
[time=2577] The death of death.
[time=2581] He through death destroyed the works of the evil one and delivered all of those, all of
[time=2588] us who through fear of death were slaves for our whole lives.
[time=2593] He comes to offer freedom in those things.
[time=2596] That's what Christmas is all about.
[time=2599] Deliverance.
[time=2600] Freedom for the captives.
[time=2601] He says it of Himself in Luke chapter 4, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach good
[time=2607] news.
[time=2610] Deliverance for the captives." We're saying at Christmas Eve night, "In His name all oppression shall cease."
[time=2618] There is no worse oppression than the oppression of a soul.
[time=2623] I talked to a person this morning whose body is breaking down, but her spirit is alive.
[time=2630] That's better.
[time=2633] You're going to resolve in the new year, and so am I.
[time=2636] Take better care of yourself.
[time=2637] And you should.
[time=2638] Because your body is temple, the Holy Spirit.
[time=2640] You should take care of yourself.
[time=2641] And so should I.
[time=2642] Better care of myself.
[time=2643] I will.
[time=2644] By the grace of God.
[time=2645] Hold me accountable if you see me.
[time=2649] It's not, please hear me, in our image conscious society.
[time=2653] Are you listening?
[time=2654] It's not better to be physically fit and spiritually dead.
[time=2658] It's not better.
[time=2659] I know you know that.
[time=2660] I'm reminding you of it.
[time=2662] It's not either or.
[time=2664] It's both.
[time=2665] It's in commercials.
[time=2666] I like both better.
[time=2667] Not nuts or bolts.
[time=2669] Nuts and bolts.
[time=2671] Physically fit.
[time=2672] Spiritually fit.
[time=2673] Physically alive.
[time=2674] Spiritually alive.
[time=2675] It's not a trade.
[time=2677] But if you have to choose one, your body is wasting away.
[time=2683] You can face it with your spirit alive.
[time=2686] I encourage you that this morning.
[time=2688] Friends, he knows what it means to suffer.
[time=2691] This word suffering is all over this passage.
[time=2693] It's like three times it shows up in the passage.
[time=2695] He knows what it means to suffer.
[time=2697] For some of you, the holidays is not comfort and joy.
[time=2702] It's suffering.
[time=2703] There's brokenness in your story.
[time=2707] Family is a hard thing for you.
[time=2709] Jesus' family called him crazy.
[time=2712] He knows what it means to suffer.
[time=2714] In every respect he was made like you, it says that.
[time=2717] In 17, he made like his brothers in every respect.
[time=2720] The original language says in all things made like you.
[time=2723] He knows what it means to suffer.
[time=2725] He's not distant and far off and removed from your suffering.
[time=2729] He's not.
[time=2730] Your Christ to God are heard by him.
[time=2733] His arm is not too short that it can't save.
[time=2736] Did you hear me?
[time=2738] I know that you think it is.
[time=2740] In other days I get it.
[time=2742] When the psalmist cries out to God, "God, where are you?" I'm in this cave and it's dark and it's cold and I'm tired.
[time=2749] I'm hungry.
[time=2750] Where are you?
[time=2753] The psalmist always ends with, "I will trust in him, yet I will hope in him." End where he ends or begin where he begins.
[time=2760] How do you want to look at it?
[time=2763] Death is swallowed up in victory.
[time=2767] So Corinthian says, "That's what Christmas is all about." He was born to die friends.
[time=2772] There's no way around it.
[time=2774] I want to read you the lyrics of this song.
[time=2777] Every January, thousands and thousands of students gather in Atlanta at the Passion Conference
[time=2785] with Chris Tomlin and Louis Giglio and many, many others.
[time=2791] And this song was introduced to them in January.
[time=2794] So we're going to bookend the year with this song.
[time=2796] I think it's wildly appropriate.
[time=2797] It's called "Death of Death." Here you go.
[time=2801] And this song is what you need to hear this morning.
[time=2805] If you're in the sound of my voice anywhere, I'm grateful you're hearing these words.
[time=2809] We can't come to the Father without the Son.
[time=2812] We can't turn his wrath without shed blood.
[time=2816] We brought nothing to the table that satisfied.
[time=2818] We were naked and poor, deaf and blind.
[time=2822] Man has sinned, but God has saved.
[time=2825] You rose and overcame the grave.
[time=2827] At the death of death where love and justice kiss, we were born to sin and only you forgive.
[time=2834] In your final breath, grace and mercy win.
[time=2837] At the death of death, you died and rose again.
[time=2841] We were just drowning.
[time=2842] We were dead to the bone.
[time=2844] You gave us hearts of flesh and took away the stone.
[time=2847] The word made flesh and love defined.
[time=2850] You didn't spare yourself.
[time=2852] The immortal one died.
[time=2855] I can't think about Christmas time.
[time=2857] I'm thinking about Narnia.
[time=2859] I think about Narnia all the time.
[time=2861] As you know, if you know me at all.
[time=2864] This quote from "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" just...
[time=2867] I kept hearing it in my head over and over again in December.
[time=2871] Spoiler alert, Aslan is killed by the wicked witch, rises again.
[time=2877] The two girls who watched him die now see him risen again.
[time=2881] They can't understand what's going on.
[time=2882] He says this to them.
[time=2884] Though the witch knew that deep magic, there is a magic deeper still what she did not know.
[time=2889] Her knowledge goes back only to the dawn of time.
[time=2892] If she had looked back a little further back into the stonest end, the darkness before time dawned,
[time=2898] she would have read there a different incantation.
[time=2901] She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed and a traitor's stead, the table would crack and death itself would start working backward.
[time=2915] Isn't that beautiful?
[time=2917] One more quote as the band comes up on this day, this time from "Lord of the Rings." There, our Tolkien was actually an important part of C.S. Lewis coming to know Christ.
[time=2926] And this is from "The Return of the King." I've got my nerd on this morning. It's okay.
[time=2934] It's a little hobbit, Sam.
[time=2936] Says this, "Fran of the story, spoiler alert.
[time=2939] Ring is destroyed. All the evils come undone." So Sam's trying to figure it out.
[time=2945] She says, "Gandalf, I thought you were dead.
[time=2948] But then I thought I was dead myself.
[time=2951] Is everything sad going to come untrue?
[time=2956] What's happened to the world?
[time=2959] A great shadow has departed," said Gandalf.
[time=2963] And then he laughed and the sound was like music, like water in a parched land.
[time=2970] Friends, Jesus is the one to whom all things are in subjection.
[time=2974] If you are in right relationship to God through his son, Jesus, then you are a son.
[time=2978] You are a brother. You are a child.
[time=2981] And Christmas is all about the death of death.
[time=2985] Let's sing about this great reality this morning together in response to what we've heard from God's Word.
[time=3005] How deep the fathers love for us, how vast beyond all measure,
[time=3018] that he should give his only son to make a wretch his treasure.
[time=3031] How great the pain of searing laws, the Father turns his face away,
[time=3045] as wounds which mar the chosen one.
[time=3052] Bring many sons to glory.
[time=3060] Let's all stand together and sing that.
[time=3064] Behold man upon the cross, my sin upon his shoulders,
[time=3083] ashamed, I hear my mocking voice,
[time=3089] called out among the scoffers.
[time=3096] It was my sin that held in prayer,
[time=3102] until it was accomplished.
[time=3109] His dying breath has brought me life.
[time=3115] I know that it is finished.
[time=3133] I will not boast in anything.
[time=3139] No power gives, no power, no wisdom.
[time=3146] But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
[time=3153] his death and resurrection.
[time=3159] Why should I gain from his reward?
[time=3165] I cannot give an answer.
[time=3172] But this I know with all my God,
[time=3178] his wounds have made my ransom.
[time=3185] Why should I gain from his reward?
[time=3191] I cannot give an answer.
[time=3199] But this I know with all my heart,
[time=3206] his wounds have made my wrath some.
[time=3215] Thank you.
[time=3229] [MUSIC]
