[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=31] Good morning and welcome to the broadcast, and welcome to 2014.
[time=37] It is a great new year filled with, we believe, great opportunities for us and for you.
[time=43] Part of the Blackhawk family, we think of you and our broadcast audience.
[time=47] Many of you have home churches, and yet you tune in each week to be encouraged.
[time=52] Many of you, this is sort of church for you, and we're grateful for that.
[time=57] Thankful for the chance to speak into your life, and as always, very hopeful that there would be a day soon
[time=64] where we could meet you face to face, where you might come and join us at 9 or 10.45 on a Sunday morning
[time=70] and allow us to begin the process of welcoming you into the family that God is growing here at Blackhawk.
[time=78] Hey, last night, the cults made an incredible comeback. It was one of the most amazing things many of us have ever seen,
[time=87] and it got me thinking this morning about our series that we're in today.
[time=92] We begin a new series every January, every January we do a series on the family,
[time=98] and today we begin a series called Real Men.
[time=101] We're going to look at God's design for men, how God intended men to live,
[time=107] how God intended men to function in relationships, in his kingdom, in their own personal lives,
[time=114] and as I was thinking about this morning, I know myself at times, and I know many other men at times
[time=122] feel as if they are in need of a comeback.
[time=126] I know that there are times, guys, where when you look at the reality of your life, you know good and well
[time=132] down deep inside, it isn't at all what God intended it to be.
[time=136] You feel as if your failures are keeping you back, you feel at times enormous amounts of regret and remorse.
[time=144] There are times when you as a man, as a husband, as a father, as a friend, you know you continue to fall short on so many fronts, and I want you to know a comeback is possible.
[time=156] And the only way you and I can ever come back and be the men that God designed us to be is when we align our lives
[time=164] and our choices and our values, not with culture, but with God's Word.
[time=169] So I hope you'll come. I hope you'll watch, I hope you'll tune into our live stream each and every week.
[time=175] I hope you'll watch the broadcast, which is one week delayed, better yet, I hope you'll come.
[time=181] And be with us on a Sunday morning throughout the whole month of January, even that first Sunday in February,
[time=187] as we look at what God has to say about men.
[time=190] It's possible. You and I can live that life, and I sure hope you'll come and live it with me.
[time=196] God bless you. Thanks so much for tuning in, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=211] You never let me go. You never let me go in everything.
[time=221] In everything I will give you praise.
[time=229] For all you are, I will bring you praise.
[time=235] You're constant and faithful. You never change.
[time=266] On to the valley low.
[time=270] To the valley low, to the mountain high.
[time=275] You are by my side, every single step all along the way.
[time=286] Everywhere I go, you are in control.
[time=291] There's no one like you, God. No one like you, God.
[time=299] In everything, in everything I will give you praise.
[time=309] For all you are, I will bring you praise.
[time=315] You're constant and faithful. You never change.
[time=346] You are God. You are God. God of all. We will sing forever.
[time=381] For all you are, I will give you praise.
[time=395] You're constant and faithful. You never change.
[time=434] All the sun comes up. The sun comes up.
[time=439] It's a new day dawning. It's time to sing your song again.
[time=450] Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me.
[time=459] Let me be singing with you because
[time=469] In the last of Lord, oh my soul. Worship His holy name.
[time=482] Sing like never before. Oh my soul, I worship your holy name.
[time=496] Are you rich in love?
[time=498] You're rich in love and you're slow to anger.
[time=505] Your name is great and your heart is crying.
[time=511] For all your goodness, I will keep on singing.
[time=519] 10,000 reasons for my heart to find.
[time=529] Bless the Lord, oh my soul. Oh my soul. Worship His holy name.
[time=541] Sing like never before. Oh my soul, I worship your holy name.
[time=554] On that day you sing. And on that day you sing.
[time=578] 10,000 is and then forever more.
[time=588] Bless the Lord, oh my soul. Oh my soul. Worship His holy name.
[time=601] Sing like never before. Oh my soul, I worship your holy name.
[time=614] Bless the Lord, oh my soul. Worship His holy name.
[time=627] Sing like never before. Oh my soul, I worship your holy name.
[time=640] I worship your holy name.
[time=654] Well, good morning and welcome to those of you who may be visiting this morning to our Sunday morning gathering.
[time=661] If we've never met, my name's Kelly. And on behalf of our staff here at Blackhawk and on behalf of our elders,
[time=669] we just say how absolutely grateful we are for this new year.
[time=674] The new opportunity that we believe it brings to watch our great God do new things in your lives and in ours.
[time=684] Many of you know that every January here at Blackhawk, we kick off the new year with a teaching series aimed at the spiritual health of the family.
[time=693] We believe families matter. We believe families matter.
[time=700] And we believe God's design for the family is valuable, helpful and worth your time, worth your energy and worth your effort to consider and follow.
[time=711] And so let's jump in and as we begin our new series this morning entitled Real Men, there will be, let me just say this,
[time=720] there will be numerous points made, a number of issues addressed and five weeks worth of what we believe could be a life changing experience for you.
[time=731] But before we begin, there is a foundational, very fundamental premise that I want to invite all of you to consider but especially you men in the room this morning.
[time=743] Very important, very foundational premise that I want you to maybe hopefully be willing to consider.
[time=750] I'm inviting you to make a very, very important decision, men.
[time=755] I'm inviting you to think about choosing God and His Word.
[time=763] We call it the Bible. I'm inviting you men in the room this morning.
[time=768] To think about choosing God and His Word is the one and only standard by which you will allow yourself to be defined as a man.
[time=778] What's going to define you in the days ahead as a man?
[time=782] What is it that you'll look to for assessment? How will you know which way you're headed?
[time=788] I'm inviting you this morning, men, to choose God and His Word as the one and only standard by which you will allow yourselves to be defined.
[time=799] So really, I'm inviting you to say no.
[time=804] I'm inviting you to say no to our culture's definition of manhood.
[time=812] Our culture would define manhood as success and strength.
[time=819] I'm inviting you to say no to your friends, some of your friends' definition of manhood.
[time=824] And I can say this, I know you. You've let me know you. I know some of your friends.
[time=829] And I know how some of your friends define manhood.
[time=832] Some of your friends define manhood as a good time.
[time=839] I'm inviting you to say no to Hollywood and hip-hop's definition of manhood, accomplishment, the pursuit of pleasure, flat-out promiscuity.
[time=853] It's blasted, it's lifted up, it's promoted, it's valued.
[time=861] It's definition of manhood that just is rampant in your world and mine.
[time=867] Success and strength, a good time, accomplishment, pursuit of pleasure, promiscuity.
[time=872] I'm inviting you to say no to maybe even your own family's definition of manhood.
[time=878] And please hear me, I'm not taking a kick at your family.
[time=882] I just know, because I've been with you long enough, I just know I've been at this long enough.
[time=887] I just know some families have a definition of manhood.
[time=891] It's kind of how they grew up, it's just kind of what they were taught.
[time=895] And there are some families who have a definition of manhood that gets passed along and it's not what God designed.
[time=904] There are some who grow up thinking manhood is work, provision, and then relax.
[time=913] I'm asking, are you willing, to above and beyond all of what they might say.
[time=919] Everyone just mentioned, are you willing to listen to what God says, to how God defines a man?
[time=926] I hope so.
[time=927] I really do because everything we're about to teach you, everything we're about to talk about and focus on comes from God's perspective.
[time=936] It will flow directly out of the Scriptures, the perfect, inerrant, God preserved, God breathed word of God.
[time=946] When we make no apology for this, it says in Psalm 19, 7, you'll see this on the screen, I hope you'll write this down.
[time=953] I want you to know we believe this, it says in Psalm 19, 7, the law of the Lord.
[time=958] Everybody just, if you've got a Bible, just hold on to it, just real quick, just humor me.
[time=963] If you've got a Bible, I want you to just hold on to it.
[time=965] If you're looking at your Bible on your phone, go ahead, use your phone, it's okay.
[time=968] Get your iPad out, that's fine.
[time=970] I want you to hold this in your hand, just for a moment here, would you do that?
[time=975] So with this Scriptures in your hand, I just want you to hear what we believe to be so very true.
[time=982] The law of the Lord is what?
[time=985] Say it, Church.
[time=986] Say it again.
[time=988] Perfect.
[time=989] We believe the law of the Lord.
[time=991] We believe the word of God is perfect.
[time=994] Restoring the soul.
[time=996] The testimony of the Lord, that's this.
[time=998] The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
[time=1003] I want to just say as we begin this morning that we believe with everything in us, I believe with all of my heart
[time=1009] that the word of God is absolutely perfect.
[time=1012] And in its perfection, God has enabled it to restore your soul.
[time=1019] And we believe across the board that there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of us each week who come into this room
[time=1026] and we believe your soul needs to be restored.
[time=1029] I know for a fact there are men in this room this morning whose souls are broken, whose lives are challenged today.
[time=1042] And I want to with great hope and with great energy and with great promise, I want to hold up to you today the word of God
[time=1049] because the word of God is perfect and it can restore your soul.
[time=1054] It can make, what does it say there?
[time=1057] The testimony of the Lord is sure, no if ands or buts, making wise the simple.
[time=1063] We're going to, over these next five weeks, base everything on the word of God.
[time=1069] And by the way, just a side note, how are those, I'll just ask you and we'll move on here.
[time=1074] How are those other options working out?
[time=1081] How, what kind of men is culture producing?
[time=1088] How's hip hop, Hollywood? How's your buddies?
[time=1092] How's all that working out when it comes to producing solid sound, honest filled with integrity, God honoring men?
[time=1103] I want to just encourage you.
[time=1105] I think God has given us the answer, I think God has given us divine direction and we're going to do our very best to humbly
[time=1111] point you in that direction over these next five weeks.
[time=1113] So here we go, real men, week one, real men really love, real men really love.
[time=1122] How about we do this, let's establish right out of the gate.
[time=1125] I hope you got a pin or I hope you'll take some notes on your iPad or even right there on your phone.
[time=1129] Let's establish right out of the gate a working definition of love.
[time=1132] I want to try and make it really simple.
[time=1134] I want to try and make it very memorable.
[time=1136] I want it to be something that you can hang on to, a biblical working definition of love.
[time=1142] And as I've scoured the scriptures, as we look at the Word of God, as we read story after story, as we look into principle after principle regarding the love of God or God's definition
[time=1155] or God's picture of love, I want to just tell you, here's where we've landed.
[time=1160] Real love designed and defined by God is fundamentally about pursuit.
[time=1170] Man, I hope you'll write that word down, I hope you'll etch it into the corner of your mind.
[time=1176] I hope you'll put it on a piece of paper, I hope you'll type it into a tablet.
[time=1179] Real love designed and defined by God is fundamentally about pursuit.
[time=1183] It's about advancing, not retreating.
[time=1186] Look at what it says in 1 John 4, 1 John 4 19.
[time=1191] If you've got your Bibles, I want you to turn there.
[time=1193] Go back to 1 John, back toward the back of your New Testament.
[time=1197] It says in the fourth chapter of John's epistle, 1 John 4 19, it says this.
[time=1203] It says we love you and I, believers.
[time=1207] We love it says in verse 19 because he, what, say it out loud church, first loved us.
[time=1216] There was love to be had, there was love that was needed.
[time=1220] There was a lover and there were the objects of love and God first loved you.
[time=1228] Real love, godly love is about movement, it's about pursuit.
[time=1234] John 3 16, for God so loved the world, for God so loved the world that he gave.
[time=1242] For God so loved the world, God saw the world in need.
[time=1246] God saw how sin had separated man from God, for God so loved the world that he gave his only son.
[time=1256] You go back to 1 John, 1 John 4, you go earlier than 19.
[time=1261] I think it's 10, 1 John 4, 10.
[time=1266] Yeah, there it is, and this is love.
[time=1268] 1 John 4, 10, and this is love.
[time=1270] Not that we loved God, but that he loved us.
[time=1275] He came after you, he pursued you and sent his son to be the propitiation, the sacrifice for our sins.
[time=1284] You had a need, you were on the outside looking in.
[time=1288] You needed to be loved, God moved.
[time=1292] God moved first, God pursues.
[time=1297] And I want to just pound this into the ground, I want to just make sure that I want to put this stake down.
[time=1302] And I want the flagged away pursuit, I want you to see it, I want you to understand it, I want you to grasp it this morning.
[time=1309] The essence of pure Godly love is selfless initiative.
[time=1314] The essence of pure Godly love is active, it's about movement toward, it doesn't sit back, it doesn't rest.
[time=1323] It doesn't wait, it doesn't calculate, real love, Godly love moves.
[time=1333] Real love pursues.
[time=1336] So man, let's be clear, really loving your wife, really loving your kids, really loving your family, involves pursuit.
[time=1345] Yes, but let's break it down a bit.
[time=1347] Will you write these three phrases down? I hope you will. Really loving involves a prioritized, would you write that down?
[time=1354] Really loving involves a prioritized pursuit.
[time=1360] What do we mean by that, guys?
[time=1363] And let me just say this too, before we go further.
[time=1366] Wife, kids, family, friends, this five week series isn't just for married, guys.
[time=1373] You know what, this five week series is for 13-year-olds in the room who one day will have an opportunity, we believe, to love a wife, a family, friends.
[time=1387] This series is for 80-year-olds who in some ways, while we might think they're done, have new opportunities every day to love.
[time=1398] This is for everyone in the room. Women, we're even going to have an opportunity for you, I'll get to it later.
[time=1403] Some things for you to think about and consider, kind of a supplement.
[time=1407] As we talk to men, we're going to give you a chance to think this through in the weeks to come.
[time=1411] We're even going to divide the room up on the last Sunday, on Super Bowl Sunday, February 2nd.
[time=1416] All the gals are going to stay here. Karen Beck's coming to teach that morning an overview of the series, kind of a wrap up for women.
[time=1425] We're going to take all the guys to the gym and watch the pre-game show. No, just kidding.
[time=1430] We're going to take all the guys to the gym and do a wrap up down there with the guys, and it's going to be an amazing five weeks.
[time=1437] But please, this is for everybody. Young men, take notes, because there's opportunities for you, even now, to be the young man that God has called you to be.
[time=1448] Really loving involves a prioritized pursuit, prioritized meaning nothing more important.
[time=1456] Meaning that in your love and in your pursuit of her, of them, of the opportunity, the object of your love, there is nothing more important.
[time=1470] It says in Ephesians 5, Ephesians 5.25, in this classic marriage passage, it says, "Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her."
[time=1486] Now, follow me. In this marriage, classic marriage passage, which is really a picture of Christ's love, we're talking about love here, this passage, this verse, it's all about Christ's love for us.
[time=1499] In that verse, Scripture says, "Men love your wives through sacrifice." It's what it says, through sacrifice.
[time=1508] And I want to just make sure you understand this. It's a very basic point, but sometimes we might overlook it.
[time=1514] Whenever you see, think about this, whenever you see someone sacrificing, good or bad, whenever you see someone making a sacrifice for something or someone else,
[time=1528] whether stated or not, when someone makes a sacrifice, and they're doing it for this or for him or for her, they're prioritizing that.
[time=1543] Does that make sense? Stated or not? Whenever you sacrifice for something or someone, you're making that something or someone a priority.
[time=1557] Men, it doesn't say, "Husbands, love your hobby." It doesn't say, "Husbands, love your job." It doesn't say, "Husbands, love your pleasure."
[time=1570] It says, "Husbands, sacrificially prioritize her." Top of the list, prioritize her by loving her. Nothing more important, priority.
[time=1589] Men, I hope you'll write that down. Real love involves a prioritized pursuit. Real love involves a determined pursuit.
[time=1599] Number two, nothing will slow it down. It cannot be swayed. It cannot be discouraged. It cannot be frustrated.
[time=1606] It is a determined, all-out pursuit. Let me invite you to come back to a great passage in Romans 5. Here in Romans 5, we see the heart.
[time=1617] We see the soul of the gospel as it gets played out with Christ and His movement and His love toward us.
[time=1624] I want to show you what it says in Romans 5, 6. Just listen to these words. In Romans 5, 6, for a while, we were still helpless.
[time=1631] At the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. In verse 8, "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
[time=1646] In verse 10, it says, "For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son."
[time=1655] You hear that? What a great picture, my friends. I hope you'll go back over that. What a great picture of love.
[time=1661] What a great picture of God's love, which you men in the room, you can emulate. The objects of God's love.
[time=1670] You had God in His love and you had the objects of His love, and the objects of His love were ungodly.
[time=1677] The objects of His love were sinners. The objects of His love, it says in verse 10, were enemies.
[time=1684] You know what that means? That means against.
[time=1689] So men, the objects of your love, there may be days when they feel like enemies.
[time=1695] There may be days where it feels like they're ungodly. There may be days where, in other words, just you kind of cut to the chase, they're difficult to love.
[time=1705] But our love is to emulate the love of God, and the love of God was determined.
[time=1710] There wasn't anything in man that was going to deter God, the Son of God, Christ, from delivering the good news of the gospel, the love, and the sacrifice that freed us.
[time=1724] Real love involves a prioritized pursuit. Real love involves a determined pursuit.
[time=1733] Really loving involves a personal pursuit. Would you write that down? Guys, it means a personal pursuit.
[time=1743] This is challenging at times for us as men, but we can do this. It involves a personal pursuit.
[time=1750] This means the pursuit. Listen, this means the pursuit must be experienced in close quarters.
[time=1757] There is an intimacy factor with real love. It's a personal pursuit. Nothing will come in between.
[time=1765] Again, we look at the book of Romans, and again, listen, again, guys, don't be afraid of this. Look with me at the way God loves.
[time=1772] Look at Romans 8. Romans 8, 37. Listen to this powerful picture of intimacy.
[time=1782] It says in Romans 8, 37, speaking of the love of God, but in all things, we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us.
[time=1792] Because of that love, verse 38, I'm convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present,
[time=1800] nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, which might try to separate me from the love of God, not going to happen.
[time=1814] We'll be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[time=1822] And I know this is kind of just crude and basic, but the honest truth is, the honest truth is this.
[time=1834] I can't, Tom Bonner, stand up right where you are. Let me just do this. Just stand up with Trey there. There's Tom and Trey back there.
[time=1844] I've known Tom Bonner for 18 years. I love Tom Bonner. I think Tom, Tom, do you still love me? Yeah, you still love me? Yeah, okay.
[time=1856] So I love Tom. I love his whole family, but I love Tom Bonner. Tom Bonner loves me.
[time=1862] But if this right here, you see this right here? See where he is? You see where I am? If this is all we ever have, him way over there, me right here, which I'm so thankful it's not.
[time=1876] See, because there's times where we get together. There's times where we're close, where we laugh, where we tell stories, where we eat food, where we trigger treat with our kids, and we've been doing that forever.
[time=1887] Point is, are you with me? You can't love someone. 30 rows back. If you didn't have Trey, I'd have him come up here and we just hug for you.
[time=1897] But you get my point. Thanks, Tom. Guys, you guys, men, we're like experts. We're experts at some, we try so hard at times to love at a distance when love requires proximity.
[time=1913] We've got to be able to touch it. We've got to be able to be face to face with it. We've got to be able to put our arms around it, and there's something in us.
[time=1924] I know, I feel it, I fail at it weekly. There's something in us that with those who are the objects of our love and because things happen and because stuff gets set and because things go wrong and because there's challenges and because there's confusion,
[time=1942] there's this thing in us as men, we just, we get 30 rows away. And we say, "Hey, I love you." But what they need is they need us to sit with them side by side, arm and arm.
[time=1962] And I want so desperately to get better at this. And I hope all of you men would join me in trying to move humbly in that direction.
[time=1973] Really loving involves a prioritized pursuit, top of the list. It involves a determined pursuit, nothing will slow it down, and it's personal.
[time=1987] It's intimate. And I know, I know right now, I just saw it on 30 faces. I know right now what most of you men are thinking.
[time=1996] You're thinking, "I can't do that. I've tried." It's not in me. And I'm here this morning to remind you to tell you otherwise.
[time=2012] You can. You can do that. You can love. And this is going to be a very practical, I hope very helpful, a little quick theology lesson that I want you to go all the way back.
[time=2023] Would you please go all the way back to Genesis? You can do this, guys. But the thing is, it's not really you. Well, it's sort of you, but well, I'll explain.
[time=2032] Go to Genesis 1. You can do this because of what it says in Genesis 1, 26, and 27. And let me tell you, men and women alike, let me tell you what you're about to see, what we're about to talk about.
[time=2045] We're just going to take a few minutes here, but in a few minutes you're about to see a life changing. This could be a life changing truth.
[time=2053] Men, you can love in the way we've described it because it says in Genesis 1, 26. It says, "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image.'" It's God, it's Jesus, it's the Holy Spirit.
[time=2070] This is the very beginning of all things, right? And so here comes the creation. And God says, "Let us make man in our image."
[time=2082] According to our likeness, and let them, men, rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, God created man in his own image.
[time=2103] In the image of God, he created man, male and female, he created them. In other words, oh, I hope you'll take this in. In other words, you, you, I was.
[time=2121] We were originally made in the, literally made in the image of God, which in the Hebrew means you were created to resemble God in your character and your values and actions.
[time=2138] This is groundbreaking truth for many of you. We can't even say publicly what some of you really think about you.
[time=2153] What you really think about who you really are and what you really come from and what you really like.
[time=2164] There are so many of us in the room with such broken and skewed pictures of who you really are, who you really could be.
[time=2177] This says that you're being, your life, your choices can be bent toward looking like him and of all the things that God was, of all the things that God is, of all the things that God did and still does.
[time=2192] Guess what the number one quality of God is? God loves. And you were made in his image. You see it in God's character, you see it in God's values, you see it in God's actions, and you were you.
[time=2211] I'm talking to you. I really am. I don't care where you've been. I don't care what you come out of. I don't care what you did or didn't have.
[time=2220] The Bible teaches us that God in our original state created you in his image, so it's possible. It's absolutely doable.
[time=2229] You as a man can love. Your character, your values, your actions can be loving to wife, kids, family, friends, because you were made to be like God.
[time=2240] You have divine DNA running in and through you. And when your heart and life are fully committed, when your heart and life are fully devoted, when your heart and life are fully surrendered to honoring God, the Spirit of God can empower you to love like God.
[time=2264] It's true. It's really very true. You can lovingly pursue others in a prioritized, determined, and personal fashion.
[time=2282] And as we wrap it up this morning, I want you to know, I'm so glad we get to come to this this morning. I want you to know that God has even gone so far as to tell you how.
[time=2294] How that can be accomplished. Do you want to accomplish this?
[time=2304] Guys, nod your heads one way or the other. Do you want to do this? Do you really? I know I believe you. I believe many of you in the room really want to do this better.
[time=2318] I know some of you in the room this morning. I'm so thankful that you've let me know you.
[time=2323] I know some of you are just beginning. You've never loved anybody.
[time=2333] And now what a gift, a new year, and a new opportunity for God to do a new thing in you.
[time=2341] And I hope you want to do this. God, God tells you, and I want to show you this, God tells you how this can be done.
[time=2348] You can love your wife, you can love your kids, you can love your family and friends in a meaningful way.
[time=2355] You know how you do it? The Bible says, and I want you to write this down. The Bible says, "Love God."
[time=2361] Do you want to love all of them? Do you want to make a difference in the lives of those that God has put in front of you?
[time=2368] You want to love them? The Bible says, "Love God." Go back to Matthew, if you would please.
[time=2373] Jesus Himself said in Matthew 22, "That the greatest," don't miss this, "the greatest singular endeavor you or I guys could ever engage in would be to love God."
[time=2385] They said, "Lord, what's the greatest commandment?" He said, "Love God."
[time=2391] Why do I mention this? Because the second greatest endeavor you could ever engage in, Jesus makes it very clear, flows out of the first.
[time=2402] Look at Matthew 22, we're going to pick it up in verse 36. It says in Matthew 22, 36, "Teacher, which is the great commandment of the law."
[time=2414] And He said to Him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."
[time=2421] This is the great and foremost commandment. The second verse 39 is like it, "You shall love others. You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
[time=2433] And so guys, what I want to invite you to this morning is I want to invite you to love God.
[time=2438] And I want to try and make that in just a couple of minutes. I want to try and make that not nebulous.
[time=2444] I want to try and make that for you real quick here. I want to try and make it very practical.
[time=2448] I want to make it something that you can think about, something you can give yourself to.
[time=2452] Because I believe with all of my heart that the love I want you to have and the love we need to see in you for a wife, for kids, for a family, for friends.
[time=2463] The endeavor toward that, I believe, is absolutely futile unless there is a love for God that is growing in your heart and in your mind and in your life.
[time=2473] Because when you love God faithfully, you then have the opportunity to meaningfully love others.
[time=2480] So I want you to love God, man. So every man in the room, I hope you'll just somehow take a note.
[time=2485] Here you go. This isn't the sum total of everything I could say, but I'll give you three things to take with you this morning.
[time=2491] Love God with your time. Love God with your time. Make time for him. Make time for his truth.
[time=2504] Make time to talk with him. Make time to study him. Make time in your day, morning, noon, or night, or all three.
[time=2515] Make time. I'm not setting up some legalistic system. I'm not trying to create a bunch of boxes that you can check and that no, I'm just saying if you want to love God like I want to love Tom or you want to love you have to spend time engaged with the object of your love.
[time=2534] And so I'm inviting you men, young men and old, to love God with your time. You get to control it. It's one of the few things we get to control in life.
[time=2544] You get to control most of those 168 hours in the week that just went by.
[time=2551] You and I would do well to make time for him in a meaningful way to listen to him, to listen to his music, to listen to his words, to respond to him in whatever ways you might respond and that might be talking with him.
[time=2568] That might be writing to him that could be discussing him with a friend at an appointed time.
[time=2575] You love God, men, you want to love your wife, you want to love your kids, you want to love your family, you want to love your friends, love him, and start with being responsible enough and diligent enough to give him the time he deserves.
[time=2589] Love God with your obedience. I know these are simple, but I believe them to be profound opportunities for you and me both.
[time=2597] You can love God with your obedience. Here you go, guys. Many of us have worked on it with little ones over the years.
[time=2605] Now, here God is working with you and me on this. If God says, "Do it," do it.
[time=2616] If God says, "Don't," do it, don't. If you need help doing what God says to do, ask for it and we'll come alongside.
[time=2628] If you need help, not doing what God says, "Don't do," say something.
[time=2636] But when you prioritize obedience, when you prioritize a life that is aligned with what the perfect Word of God says, when you and I are giving ourselves toward that,
[time=2650] we're making a commitment to obey it and doing everything humanly possible to surround ourselves with an environment and with people who will move us toward obedience.
[time=2663] And away from disobedience, your love for God has a chance. It really does to grow.
[time=2670] When you love them with your time, when you love them with your obedience, I'll say this to you before we move on real quick.
[time=2677] You can't obey what you don't know. And so I would highly encourage you guys.
[time=2685] We've got tables set up in the for you this morning.
[time=2689] All the tables out there represent smaller settings around here, small communities, community groups.
[time=2695] There are some that meet on Sunday mornings. There are some that meet during the week.
[time=2699] And over the next three weeks, there's going to be people at those tables.
[time=2703] And they're going to be there for one purpose. And that is to share with you an invitation to come and join them as they walk through life.
[time=2710] And they're going to be working on these things. They're going to be giving attention to these things.
[time=2715] Men, if you're going to really love, you've got to really love God.
[time=2720] Love them with your time. Love them with your obedience and love God with your service.
[time=2725] And with that, I'll just say this, guys, as Adam comes back up and as we finish and worship this morning,
[time=2734] a wise, gracious pastor taught me years ago that at five or six or whenever it is that we come home from work,
[time=2748] he taught me to sit there in the car for a few minutes and roll up my sleeves.
[time=2756] He taught me that the greatest opportunity I could have to honor God was my willingness to serve others.
[time=2764] And your wife and your kids and your family and your friends.
[time=2768] There are times they need your help. There are times they need your engagement. There are times they don't need you in a chair.
[time=2774] They need you on the ground. There are times they need you present, not distant.
[time=2780] And so I would invite you men to serve, to love God through your service, to serve here,
[time=2786] to serve in a ministry, to serve downtown, to serve in your family, to be a man who sleeves our rolled up,
[time=2794] who relaxes when he puts his head on the pillow.
[time=2798] And in the meantime, gives himself the wonderful, beautiful task at hand. Real men, they love.
[time=2806] And the women in their lives have a chance to help. Women, it's not up to you. His choice to love is his choice.
[time=2816] But there are things that you can think about. There are things that you can consider.
[time=2819] I'm so grateful Karen Beck who will be here to teach on the second of February provided these and she'll provide these throughout the series. Questions, gals, for you to take home, for you to pray through, for you to think about, for you to respond to, and we hope you will.
[time=2833] You can help the process or you can hurt it. This little handout is a way for you to help.
[time=2839] Would you stand and let's worship our God together?
[time=2854] We bow weak here to find my last. Without you, I fall apart. You are the one that guides my heart.
[time=2878] Oh, I need you. Oh, I need you.
[time=2885] Every hour I need you.
[time=2892] I want a defense by righteousness. Oh, God, how I need you.
[time=2908] With some lies to you. The grace is more. The grace is found, is where you are.
[time=2921] And where you are, what I am free.
[time=2928] Oldliness is Christ to me. And where you are, what I am free.
[time=2941] Oldliness is Christ to me. Oh, I need you. Oh, I need you.
[time=2959] Every hour I need you. My one defense, my righteousness. Oh, God, how I need you.
[time=2982] So teach my song to rise to you. When temptation comes my way.
[time=2993] And when I cannot stand, I'll follow you.
[time=2999] Jesus, you're my hope, and you stay when I can't stand.
[time=3005] But when I cannot stand, I'll follow you.
[time=3011] Jesus, you're my hope and stay.
[time=3019] Oh, I need you. Oh, I need you. Every hour I need you.
[time=3033] My one defense, my righteousness. Oh, God, how I need you. Oh, I need you.
[time=3047] Every hour I need you. My one defense, my righteousness. Oh, God, how I need you.
[time=3071] You're my one defense, my righteousness. Oh, God, how I need you.
[time=3095] Christ is my reward in all my devotion.
[time=3107] Now there's nothing in this world that could ever satisfy.
[time=3116] Through every trial, through every trial. My soul will sing, no turning back.
[time=3127] I've been savory. Christ is enough for me. Christ is enough for me.
[time=3145] Everything I need isn't you. You're everything I need.
[time=3156] Christ, my own in all. Enjoying my salvation.
[time=3168] And this hope will never fail. Heaven is our home. Through every storm.
[time=3178] Through every storm. My soul will sing. Jesus is here to God be the glory.
[time=3192] Christ is enough for me. Christ is enough for me.
[time=3206] Everything I need isn't you. You're everything I need. Christ is enough. Christ is enough for me.
[time=3222] Christ is enough for me. Everything I need isn't you.
[time=3235] You're everything I need.
[time=3246] Aren't I decided?
[time=3250] I had decided to follow Jesus, no turning back.
[time=3259] No turning back. I had decided to follow Jesus, no turning back.
[time=3270] No turning back.
[time=3274] Christ before me, the world behind me. No turning back. No turning back.
[time=3293] No turning back. I had decided to follow Jesus, no turning back.
[time=3320] Christ is enough. Christ is enough for me. Christ is enough for me.
[time=3336] Everything I need isn't you. You're everything I need.
[time=3346] Christ is enough for me. Christ is enough for me.
[time=3359] Everything I need isn't you. You're everything I need.
[time=3367] I had decided to follow Jesus, no turning back. No turning back.
[time=3380] I had decided to follow Jesus, no turning back.
[time=3392] One more time I decided I had decided to follow Jesus, no turning back.
[time=3403] No turning back. I had decided to follow Jesus, no turning back.
[time=3422] Let me leave you with this as Adam plays. Let me just give you this last thought.
[time=3428] It's last night and we saw the forecast for tomorrow.
[time=3435] So all of life is canceled I guess tomorrow minus 17 or whatever it's going to be.
[time=3441] So we decide we're going to get all the wood or half of our stack of wood that's outside.
[time=3445] I'm like I'm going to get it inside the garage because I'm not going outside when it's minus 17.
[time=3451] So Jake's going to help me and I'm out there before he gets out there.
[time=3456] I know there's the small pieces of wood, kindling.
[time=3460] I know Jake made some and I know I had brought some and I know it's somewhere and I know we're low on paper
[time=3466] so unless I can find this small stuff we're going to have a challenge and I can't find it.
[time=3471] There's snow all over the wood and we're knocking the big stuff around and I can't find it.
[time=3476] It's like it's not there and I'm kicking and I realize there's some down there and I'm swiping and I've got a shovel
[time=3482] and there's wood below that and there's snow down there and there's ice and my hands are getting cold and down there at the very bottom like six inches below in the middle of a bunch of ice and snow there it was.
[time=3496] And I want to just remind you that down deep inside of you under a bunch of stuff is the image of God.
[time=3506] It's there.
[time=3508] It is there and it will bring warmth and it will bring meaning and it will bring to your life what God designed your life to have
[time=3517] when you live and choose and function from that.
[time=3521] When we may have to bust some things up we may have to kick some things around.
[time=3526] We may have to get our hands cold we may have to get a little dirty but we're going to in the next five weeks we're going to work on that guys it's there and you and I can live out of that amen.
