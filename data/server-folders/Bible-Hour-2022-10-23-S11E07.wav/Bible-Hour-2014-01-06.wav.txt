[time=31] Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=35] It's great to be with you.
[time=36] I'm so thankful again for this new year and all of us at Black Hawk are grateful for the opportunity we get week after week to really be a part of this with so many of you.
[time=47] Thousands and thousands of people tune in each week to the Bible hour and every week we don't take it for granted.
[time=55] We pray for you.
[time=56] We're thankful for you.
[time=57] We're asking God to do great things in your heart and in your mind and in your life.
[time=63] And we're just absolutely grateful that we get to be a small part of what He's doing in you.
[time=69] Along with the rest of our team are so thankful for the new year.
[time=73] It means a family series every January at Black Hawk.
[time=77] We engage in a teaching from God's Word regarding the family and this year we're focusing on men.
[time=83] That's right.
[time=84] The series title that you're about to listen to today is called Real Men.
[time=88] We come to part two today and I want to just say before you watch it I want to say to you men in the audience and I want to say this to you young men and I want to say this to you older men.
[time=99] I want to say this to any man listening God designed you to make a difference.
[time=105] He did.
[time=106] God designed you to make a difference.
[time=108] He designed you to love and to leave and to care for and to step into the lives of those that are in your life.
[time=117] God designed you from the very beginning to be a being that would with your words and with your actions and with your life make a difference.
[time=128] And the truth is the sad tragic truth is that way too many men today aren't making a difference.
[time=136] And if that's you, if truth be told you know in the depths of your heart you're not living up to not the expectations of others but the expectation of God.
[time=146] God's desire and His design for you to make a difference in this world.
[time=151] I hope you'll listen today.
[time=153] I hope you'll open your heart.
[time=155] I hope you'll maybe just ask God right now.
[time=157] Oh God, teach me and grow me and help me be the man that you've called me to be.
[time=163] We want to be a support in that as well.
[time=165] So while you're watching today I hope you'll come and meet us someday soon.
[time=170] I hope you'll walk through these doors and come and be a part of this family.
[time=174] Let us help you as a man grow in your faith, grow in your relationships.
[time=180] Let us do all that we can to help be the man that God designed you to be.
[time=184] I'm so glad you tuned in.
[time=185] I hope it's a blessing to you today.
[time=187] God bless you.
[time=188] I am grateful for our relationship and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=193] Bye-bye.

[time=1315] Last week we talked about how real men love.
[time=1318] And I hope if you didn't get a chance to hear that, I hope you'll go online and watch it.
[time=1322] Hope you'll go online and listen to it and take it in.
[time=1324] Today we come to the reality and the way that God designed this thing, guys.
[time=1329] Today we come to the reality that real men lead.
[time=1334] Real men lead.
[time=1336] He is without doubt the single greatest source of personal insecurity in my life that's ever lived.
[time=1345] In the vernacular of our day, he kills me.
[time=1348] He leaves me feeling inept, cowardly, and at times quite frankly, he leaves me feeling weak.
[time=1355] He always knew what to do, always had a plan to fix what didn't work, and he wasn't afraid of anything or any one.
[time=1363] Here is on the screen without question, one of the greatest sources of pain to many of us modern men.
[time=1370] There he is.
[time=1371] (congregation laughing) Charles Ingles.
[time=1376] Some of you young people don't know who that is.
[time=1378] If you don't know who Charles Ingles is, do me a favor, put the video game.
[time=1382] It stopped blowing people up and go rent Little House on the Prairie.
[time=1387] And get a season or two of Little House on the Prairie and just watch Pa, Charles Ingles, and you'll soon begin to feel the same things about him that I do.
[time=1401] Charles, a pioneer settler who courageously leads his wife whose name is, Carolyn, thank you, and family into and through the challenges of the great Western frontier.
[time=1412] He was willing to speak up, offered meaningful insights, even into the lives of teenage girls.
[time=1419] He was fixed skinned, he worked hard and smart.
[time=1423] He stood for what was right.
[time=1424] He was courageous in the face of fear and inspired those around him to do the same.
[time=1430] And truth be told, your wife and mine have for years thought he was hot.
[time=1433] (congregation laughing) There I said it.
[time=1437] Charles Ingles was a great man.
[time=1440] He was a great husband.
[time=1442] He was a great father.
[time=1443] He was a great friend.
[time=1444] Charles Ingles, my friend, was a leader.
[time=1447] He was a leader, not a leader defined by enormous charisma or public eloquence or the biggest voice in the room.
[time=1458] We wrongly, at times, equate leadership with personality, don't we?
[time=1463] No, no, no, that wasn't Charles Ingles.
[time=1466] No, he was a leader because he was always willing to step into, please write this down.
[time=1472] Young men in the room, write this down.
[time=1474] Older guys, be reminded of this because this is real leadership.
[time=1479] Not a leader because of his personality.
[time=1481] No, he was a leader because he was always willing to step into, not away from, all that life brought.
[time=1488] And life brings a lot, doesn't it?
[time=1495] A real leader by God's design, always willing to step into, not away from, all that life brings.
[time=1505] Real men by God's design step into.
[time=1508] Real men step forward, not back.
[time=1511] And this morning I want you to see that real men lead in three ways.
[time=1514] And I hope you'll just write these three things down.
[time=1516] When you do that, real men lead in three ways.
[time=1519] And 13-year-olds, you can do this.
[time=1524] 40 and 50 and 60-year-olds, you can still do this.
[time=1527] Real men by God's design lead by number one, stepping into confusion.
[time=1533] Real men by God's design, as they lead, they do so by stepping at times into confusion.
[time=1543] Real men lead by stepping up to face fear.
[time=1546] And thirdly, we'll see this morning that real men lead by stepping through passivity.
[time=1554] Stepping through passivity.
[time=1556] Let's start with how real men, as they lead, step into confusion.
[time=1563] Abraham.
[time=1568] Flaws and faults and all.
[time=1570] And if you've ever studied the book of Genesis, you know that he had quite a few.
[time=1574] But nonetheless, Abraham was a great leader.
[time=1577] God used Abraham's leadership to further God's kingdom plan with the people of Israel.
[time=1584] And over time, God taught Abraham many valuable leadership lessons.
[time=1589] Not the least of which was the need at times to step into confusion.
[time=1598] Not the least of which was the need at times to follow God into that which didn't always make sense.
[time=1607] Not the least of which was.
[time=1611] The need at times to take very difficult steps
[time=1618] in response to God's call while exercising great trust in God.
[time=1626] The only thing Abraham ever really wanted was a what?
[time=1630] A son.
[time=1631] All he and Sarah ever longed for was an heir.
[time=1637] A boy of their own.
[time=1639] That could one day carry on the family legacy, the family line.
[time=1643] And after what was basically a lifetime of heartache and barrenness, God promises them a son.
[time=1650] At the age of 100, He promises them a son.
[time=1654] And in due time, Sarah actually miraculously gives birth to who?
[time=1660] Say it, Isaac, to Isaac.
[time=1664] And with Isaac, God's big picture plan.
[time=1669] With Isaac, God's design for future redemption through the line of Messiah takes a huge step forward.
[time=1678] And then God inexplicably asks for something.
[time=1683] Then God asks Abraham for something.
[time=1690] He walked up a hill.
[time=1693] Genesis 22 is where this all transpires.
[time=1696] You can write that down.
[time=1698] Genesis 22, He walks up a hill.
[time=1700] Think about it, guys.
[time=1701] Think about it, He walks up a hill with the wood on His only son's back.
[time=1708] God asks Abraham to literally sacrifice the only son He ever had the son He waited all those years for.
[time=1716] So confusing.
[time=1719] So mind boggling for you and I to even think about
[time=1725] much less for him to even endure.
[time=1728] Guys, let me ask you a question.
[time=1730] Men young and old in the room this morning, please listen, who is it or what is it?
[time=1738] That's calling for your involvement.
[time=1740] In your life today, men.
[time=1742] Who is it or what is it that needs your help?
[time=1746] Your intervention and yet they this person or it this circumstance is so very confusing for you.
[time=1754] You don't know how to do it.
[time=1758] You know something should be done.
[time=1761] You know something needs fixing.
[time=1765] Again, whether it's them or it, you're very aware this morning in the honesty of your heart that something isn't right and God's calling you and yet you don't even know where to begin.
[time=1777] It feels like an impossible task.
[time=1780] So much seems so uncertain when you even think about stepping in that direction.
[time=1787] But this you know, God is asking you as a man,
[time=1793] as a husband, as a father, as a friend to step forward toward it.
[time=1799] You say, what are you talking about?
[time=1804] Like help me understand what you mean.
[time=1806] All right, I'll try, I'll try.
[time=1809] I've lived a little bit of life.
[time=1812] I bet maybe I can come close.
[time=1814] Maybe God is asking you to ask her, your wife
[time=1822] or your daughter.
[time=1824] Maybe God is asking you, men, to ask her more questions, even if the answers are going to be hard to hear.
[time=1834] God, maybe this morning, men is prompting you in your heart to call a meeting and finally just get things on the table.
[time=1843] To finally just talk about it.
[time=1847] You say, what's it?
[time=1849] I say, you know what it is if that's you this morning.
[time=1854] There may just finally be the need in your heart to get people together, to sit down and to start talking it through.
[time=1864] Maybe God is calling you men this morning to offer friendship or forgiveness in a situation that seemingly deserves the absolute opposite.
[time=1876] I mean, again, whether it's them, him, her or it's this circumstance, in your mind, in your humanness, you think the last thing in the world you should do is go offer friendship or forgiveness.
[time=1890] But maybe, maybe what God is calling you to is the absolute confusion of stepping in that direction and offering those very things, even if it makes no sense.
[time=1904] Men, young men, older men, maybe this morning, God is calling you to finally confess something.
[time=1913] Maybe it's time that you just admit it.
[time=1918] Maybe it's time to ask for some help.
[time=1924] Maybe it's time to beg for the accountability
[time=1930] and involvement that you know you desperately need.
[time=1935] Maybe it's time to confess or admit something that might bring uncomfortable, deep confusion to you and others you love, but maybe it's time because sometimes leading, sometimes influencing and caring for others requires stepping into that which is confusing.
[time=1952] Will you, as we think about Abraham this morning and the walk up that hill?
[time=1958] Men, will you trust God with that much?
[time=1964] I don't know if I touched on anything.
[time=1966] Maybe I did, but you know in your heart the steps that you should take.
[time=1971] You know the situation and you know the individual or individuals that need you.
[time=1975] Will you trust God with that much to step forward into confusion?
[time=1981] Real men do.
[time=1983] And real men do so with the understanding of what it says in Proverbs three, five, and six.
[time=1988] And to many of you in the church, when I say Proverbs three, five, and six, you go, oh yeah, that verse about trust.
[time=1993] But now in the midst of this discussion, in the heart of this matter, sometimes Proverbs three, five, and six takes on a whole new meaning because it says trust God, right?
[time=2003] You see it there on the screen, trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[time=2006] And sometimes when it's so confusing and you're about to step forward, that's about all you can do is trust Him with everything you've got.
[time=2015] It says in that passage, trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.
[time=2022] Are you kidding me if I do this?
[time=2023] I'm gonna die.
[time=2025] If I do this, she's gonna die.
[time=2027] If I step in here, they're gonna die.
[time=2030] If this is just too big, it's too much, it's too scary.
[time=2034] And it says, no, lean not on your own assessment of this thing.
[time=2039] Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[time=2043] And it goes on in verse six.
[time=2045] It says, in all your ways, acknowledge Him and He will make your paths what?
[time=2052] Not confused, He'll straighten it out.
[time=2055] He'll make it clear, He will, I promise you.
[time=2058] If you're willing as a man to step into confusion, we'll come back to that, guys.
[time=2065] Secondly though, I want you to write this down, real men lead, real men lead by stepping up to face fear.
[time=2072] Real men lead by stepping up to face fear with this one, guys, this morning will be brief and to the point in all of history, there has been no greater man not to mention leader than Jesus himself, Jesus who is the epitome of manhood.
[time=2088] And the world has never seen witnessed or experienced
[time=2094] the depth of leadership, like the leadership given by Jesus of Nazareth.
[time=2100] He was the greatest of all men.
[time=2103] He was leadership personified.
[time=2106] And on the night, He was betrayed knowing full well what was to come, He was, don't miss this, He was afraid.
[time=2114] Jesus was scared in His humanness.
[time=2120] I believe He was absolutely petrified and we see this playing out turn in your Bibles to your New Testament, the very first book, The Gospel of Matthew.
[time=2129] It says in Matthew 26, it paints this picture for us of these last moments in the garden.
[time=2137] He and His friends, He and His disciples, Jesus knows what's coming as that night unfolds.
[time=2145] He knows the Romans are on their way.
[time=2147] He knows the torture and the beating and the crucifixion is about to happen.
[time=2152] And it says in Matthew 6, 39, and He went a little beyond them.
[time=2158] There's a reason He went a little beyond them.
[time=2161] He walked past where they were.
[time=2163] He didn't want them to see what He knew was about to happen.
[time=2166] And it says He went a little beyond them and fell on His face.
[time=2170] Jesus, greatest man, greatest leader of all, falls on His face and prayed saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me." The cup there is the wrath of God's judgment.
[time=2186] The cup is the torture and the beating and the pain and the loss that He's about to experience.
[time=2192] The cup is all the inhumane treatment that His body and soul are about to endure.
[time=2198] This cup is God the Father turning His back on Him.
[time=2202] This is horrible stuff that's about to happen.
[time=2205] And He knows it.
[time=2208] It's right there and He faces it.
[time=2213] He was a man, a genuine leader.
[time=2219] There was fear and He faced it.
[time=2222] Many of you know the rest of the story.
[time=2225] Many of you in this room know that He didn't run that night.
[time=2232] Most of us in the room know that when they came for Him, He stood there, stepped right into the middle of it and they slaughtered Him.
[time=2244] As my grandpa Joe used to say, used to say it to all of us cousins, we used to always hear Him say when it came to scary stuff, face it forward.
[time=2255] Always said face it forward, which meant don't flinch,
[time=2261] don't duck, don't back in, look it in the eyes and face it.
[time=2266] I love this quote, I've had it for years.
[time=2272] Comes from J.T. Mack, it says this as young men turn old.
[time=2277] There is oftentimes one singular act among all of life's acts that can haunt them, fill them with remorse and satiate their soul with regret like no other.
[time=2289] This act eats away at a man's soul because it is an absolute opposition to the true constitution of a man.
[time=2297] This act is the debilitating act of cowardice.
[time=2305] Men in the room this morning, boys, young men, dads, older men, what are you afraid of?
[time=2312] I'm gonna ask you to, don't look at me and say, "Ah, I'm not afraid of anything." Don't say that 'cause I know you're lying and you know you're lying and we all know that's not true.
[time=2324] So I'm giving you a chance to reflect this morning.
[time=2326] You can write it down or you can just think about it in the quietness of your own heart but it's important this morning, believe me, it's so important that you answer this question.
[time=2334] What are you afraid of?
[time=2336] What is it that's looming out in front of you today?
[time=2341] You know it, it's them, it's her or it's it, it's the circumstance and it has you scared to death.
[time=2349] Who is it that you're afraid of?
[time=2354] Who is it that you're in relationship with or who is it in your life and you know truth be told this morning, the spirit of God is prompting you to see and identify, you know there should be steps taken and they absolutely terrify you.
[time=2372] What is it that you're afraid of guys?
[time=2378] Maybe you look at it this way, men, what good is being florited?
[time=2383] In other words, what bad is going forward because you've allowed fear to grip you and rule you and reign in your life.
[time=2393] There's some good things, some kingdom things, some healthy things that could happen in the midst of your courage and your bravery but it's not happening because you've allowed yourself to be absolutely utterly controlled by the fear of the circumstance or the fear of the individual.
[time=2413] Men, please listen, what are you putting off?
[time=2416] What are you putting up with?
[time=2417] What are you trying to put behind you because of fear?
[time=2420] Be a man who by faith, walk up a hill for goodness sake, I know it's hard, walk up a hill with the wood
[time=2435] on your son's back going are you kidding me?
[time=2439] How in the world is this gonna work out?
[time=2442] Men, men, by faith, the faith of Abraham, walk up a hill today, tomorrow, this week.
[time=2450] With great trust in the Lord, oh trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own assessment.
[time=2457] Step up, deal with it or at least I wrote this down
[time=2463] or at least try to and I wanna say something about this because you might be hearing me and in your mind you might be thinking that what I'm saying to you is you've gotta try and you've gotta hit it out of the park.
[time=2475] You've gotta step forward and you've gotta win.
[time=2479] You gotta step forward and she or they have gotta step back and go whoa, he is here.
[time=2487] No, no, no, I'm not saying that.
[time=2490] I'm saying take a step.
[time=2494] I'm just saying say something.
[time=2498] I'm saying let it be known that you're at least willing to go into it and not away from it.
[time=2506] And that in my mind is great success.
[time=2509] [AMEN] Third thing.
[time=2514] And again, I just hope you're jotting these down.
[time=2516] Real men lead by stepping through passivity.
[time=2524] Genesis three, would you go back to the beginning?
[time=2527] Oh my, there's nothing sadder than this.
[time=2530] There isn't anything at all my friends.
[time=2532] More dark and desperate than what you're about to read many of you again.
[time=2539] For some of you it may be the first time, but this is where all of sin began.
[time=2544] This is where the fall of man occurs.
[time=2546] This is where God's beautiful creation takes the biggest hit of all.
[time=2552] This is Adam and Eve and the serpent.
[time=2557] You said, wait a minute.
[time=2559] Wasn't that Eve and the serpent?
[time=2560] And I'm saying no, no, this morning please be reminded.
[time=2564] It wasn't just Eve and the serpent.
[time=2567] It was the serpent, Eve and Adam.
[time=2571] Yes, he was there.
[time=2573] Look at the text.
[time=2574] It says in Genesis three, six.
[time=2576] After Eve and the serpent go through this back and forth, the temptation comes, eat what God told you not to eat.
[time=2582] Eve says, no, we can't.
[time=2584] The serpent says what the serpent says to you.
[time=2587] Sure you can.
[time=2588] It'll all be all right, right?
[time=2591] That's what the enemy says to you about sin, right?
[time=2594] So then when the woman saw of her six, here it is, hard to even read it.
[time=2599] When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was desirable to make one why she took from its fruit and ate.
[time=2611] And she gave also to her husband who was with her.
[time=2616] She didn't take the fruit to the other side of the garden.
[time=2621] She didn't wait a couple hours for him to show up.
[time=2623] No, the text is very clear that Adam, this man who God gave to Eve so that he could lead love and protect
[time=2633] when it starts to unravel.
[time=2636] Guys, I know this is hard, but just bear with me 'cause I've been there.
[time=2639] When it starts to unravel, when the attitudes start to flare up, when the tension starts to rise, when the conflict begins to settle in, when the, it's so thick you could cut it with a knife when you see how this thing's absolutely going south.
[time=2659] You and I tend to do what Adam did right there and that is we tend to shut up, we tend to be quiet, we tend to back away and sin runs its course.
[time=2670] And he shut up, he backed away, he was right there.
[time=2675] He should have ripped that thing out of the tree.
[time=2678] He should have kicked it in the head.
[time=2680] He should have said, not on my watch.
[time=2682] As scared as he might have been not knowing what he was supposed to say, you and I know that what he should have done is he should have jumped up and said, no, that's not right.
[time=2694] And he didn't do that and we don't do that enough.
[time=2701] We get quiet and passive when God calls us to step forward
[time=2708] and be men.
[time=2709] Like Adam, you have a tendency towards silence.
[time=2717] I shut down when things get tense.
[time=2721] You're thinking, no, you don't do that, Kelly.
[time=2726] You're a pastor, you're a leader.
[time=2729] You know all these truths, no, I stink at it.
[time=2736] I need help with this, just like you do.
[time=2738] I want so badly to be better at this.
[time=2742] And so I hope with you, we keep trying.
[time=2746] I hope we keep stepping forward.
[time=2748] We shut down when things get tense, we're quiet.
[time=2753] We get distant when the situation gets critical or heightened.
[time=2756] When the truth is, guys, real men, real men say something.
[time=2762] Real men prayerfully insert themselves.
[time=2766] Real men prayerfully, humbly stay present.
[time=2770] They don't go away, they don't disappear.
[time=2773] I'm gonna ask Adam to come, I'm gonna ask all of you
[time=2779] to just stay in your seats, please.
[time=2780] There's a bit more that I wanna share with you this morning.
[time=2784] But right now, I just wanna give you a chance to do something, guys, that we don't normally give you the chance to do.
[time=2788] It seems like time is always of the essence and so we've created a little bit here for you this morning.
[time=2793] But would all of you in the room just bow your heads?
[time=2796] Would you do that?
[time=2798] Would all of you in the room just close your eyes?
[time=2800] And I'm gonna give men and women a chance here, but I'm gonna aim most of my comments here at the guys.
[time=2807] Guys, I'm gonna give you a couple minutes here.
[time=2809] It may be the only quiet couple of minutes you get in this day.
[time=2813] I don't know what the rest of the afternoon or evening looks like for you, but I want to give you a couple of minutes right here to do what you and I should do often, and that is be before God as men.
[time=2826] Young guys, I want you to get in the practice of this.
[time=2829] Older guys who maybe have lost the practice of this.
[time=2832] Let's begin to reinsert this into your life, but here's what I'm gonna let you do.
[time=2838] I'm gonna give you the chance right now in your own words, from your own heart, to just simply ask God, a God who loves you and a God who you can trust.
[time=2848] When it comes to your leadership, I'm gonna give you a chance right now to ask God for help.
[time=2854] I'm gonna give you a chance right now to ask God for some forgiveness.
[time=2858] I'm gonna give you the chance right here for you in your heart before a God who's listening and present.
[time=2865] He's here with us.
[time=2867] I'm gonna give you the chance to just say to Him what's true and real.
[time=2873] And I'm gonna start with where we started, just briefly, would you just right now?
[time=2879] Would you ask God, guys, for the courage and strength to step into that circumstance or that situation that's confusing, go ahead.
[time=2889] Ask Him to hold you up.
[time=2892] Ask Him to give you boldness.
[time=2895] Ask Him to keep the enemy at bay, and would you right now just take Him in and ask Him to help you move toward that, which maybe doesn't make a lot of sense?
[time=2905] (gentle music) Ladies, you may be sitting next to a man.
[time=2917] He may be your husband, he may be your dad, he may be a friend.
[time=2921] You may be sitting next to a man, you don't know.
[time=2923] Would you have the willingness right now, ladies, to just pray that same prayer for Him?
[time=2931] You ask God to help Him.
[time=2934] Man, I'm gonna ask you in that same spirit of prayer, I'm gonna ask you to go to that second point from this morning, and guys, would you just in all honesty, would you just in your own words from your own hearts, say to God, what scares you?
[time=2951] Would you just admit to Him?
[time=2953] Who is it that you're afraid of?
[time=2954] What is it that you're afraid of becoming?
[time=2957] What circumstance carries with it fear, and instead of moving toward it like you should, you move away from it.
[time=2965] Would you guys right now, would you be willing to just ask God to help you be strong, to be valiant, to be noble?
[time=2974] Even though you're scared, would you ask Him to give you the strength to not run away?
[time=2985] Ladies, maybe He's your husband, maybe He's your dad, maybe He's a friend, would you pray for the guy sitting near you, along those very lines?
[time=2996] And lastly, men, and maybe most importantly,
[time=3003] would you just be willing right now in the quietness of your heart to confess and admit the failure, your sin of passivity, being passive, will you admit to God that you do that, will you also admit to Him that it has brought destruction, that it has brought damage, that it has hurt you, and it has hurt those you love, will you confess that passivity, and will you in the quietness of your heart today, in this moment, would you beg God for a new strength, and a new humble willingness
[time=3044] to stand in front, and to say something, do something to do anything except nothing?
[time=3053] Would you pray that prayer?
[time=3056] Ladies, would you pray that very same thing for Him whoever He might be?
[time=3062] Oh Father in Heaven, we know you hear these prayers, we believe that, so many of us in the room today, we believe that with all of our hearts, and we know you, you know our circumstances, you know every man's situation here in this room, and so God, as we pray these prayers, and we beg you for the help that we desperately need, we are thankful that you hear us.
[time=3085] I know God may, you continue to be at work in us today, tomorrow, even as the week progresses.
[time=3091] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=3094] I'm gonna ask Karen Beck to come, thanks Adam.
[time=3097] I'm gonna ask Karen Beck to come on up, I told many of you this last week, but if you weren't here, I wanna just say it again.
[time=3104] I'm so thankful Karen's been willing to work with us over these five weeks, she's providing the material for you ladies in your bullets, and Karen and Tim have been a part of our family here at Blackhawk for over 20, 25 years, she has served in a number of different ways, teaching, discipling, counseling, moms and wives, and has just had a tremendous ministry.
[time=3128] She's actually gonna be speaking on the last week of this series, we're gonna all meet here together on Sunday, February 2nd, and then the ladies are gonna stay in here, and Karen's gonna kind of do a teaching that really helps wrap up the series for you ladies, and the guys are gonna go to the gym and do some things down there along those same lines.
[time=3150] But I ask Karen if she'd come this morning just briefly as we close, and just share a few things with you ladies this morning regarding the sheet.
[time=3157] I hope you have your insert and your bulletin.
[time=3159] She's provided some thoughts for you, and she's just gonna talk you through that briefly, so give your attention to Karen.
[time=3165] Thank you for being here.
[time=3167] - I've had the joy and privilege of working with women really starting from high school gals all the way up to my age, and this issue of leadership and following comes up again and again and again, and I was talking about it with a pastor friend of mine several years ago, and he said, "You know, men don't know "any more how to lead than women know how to fall.
[time=3194] "It is just as scary for men." We just assume that men know how to lead, and they should be making good decisions all the time.
[time=3204] But God has a command for us as women.
[time=3207] He invites us to follow our husbands, and he writes to us through Peter that we have the potential of winning even a disobedient husband by the way that we follow, by our gentle spirit, by our behavior, by our kindness, our quiet heart.
[time=3232] Doesn't mean we don't speak words because God invites us to have honest dialogue with one another in our marriage, but he's calling us to follow the leader in our home.
[time=3247] And whether it's our husband, whether it's our pastor, whether it's our president, whether it's our mayor, he brings blessing through these relationships as we follow well.
[time=3259] So what keeps us from following?
[time=3263] Because God never asks us to commit to sin.
[time=3267] What keeps us from following most of the time?
[time=3270] Well, it's our unwillingness when we fear.
[time=3274] So often I hear women just say, he scares me to death.
[time=3277] I don't like the way he handles our finances.
[time=3280] I don't like the way he disciplines the children.
[time=3282] I don't like his hobbies.
[time=3284] He just scares me.
[time=3285] But what we're really saying is we just don't trust him.
[time=3289] And God is asking us really ultimately to trust him.
[time=3294] As we trust him, we can practice that with our husbands.
[time=3299] Often it's selfishness.
[time=3302] I just don't want to.
[time=3303] I have my ways and I like them better.
[time=3306] Sometimes it's just preferences.
[time=3309] Not only are men and women different, but we just have different ways that we like to do things, neither of them right or wrong that keep us from following.
[time=3318] And then it's just my pride.
[time=3322] I just think I know best.
[time=3323] I know the best way to do it.
[time=3325] And that causes such tension.
[time=3329] God delights in full obedience, not partial obedience, full obedience.
[time=3335] And he promised us to give us all the resources that we need.
[time=3339] So as we work through some of these questions and challenges this week about following, would you be willing to immerse yourself in scripture and hear what God says to us women?
[time=3355] Join with other women that are seeking to follow God as well.
[time=3359] Ask your husband.
[time=3360] Would you be willing to go home from church today and just ask your husband?
[time=3365] How have I followed you well?
[time=3368] And where have I really fallen down in that?
[time=3371] Where have I caused problems for you?
[time=3374] Where have I thwarted your leadership and even caused fear?
[time=3378] Because I have caused so much tension.
[time=3381] Would you help me grow in being a better follower?
[time=3388] Look for practical ways to affirm your husband's decisions, express gratitude.
[time=3395] There's nothing that doesn't ignite and fuel a man more than to know that he's appreciated and loved in that kind of way.
[time=3404] Practice submitting us unto the Lord.
[time=3408] A lot of times I hear, well just trust your husband, but you know the reality, God is saying, would you submit and follow as unto me?
[time=3418] It honors God.
[time=3421] So even when we pray then for our marriages, would you be willing to pray that God would be exalted in your marriage?
[time=3428] Not that you get your way, not that he is who you think he should be, but that God would be glorified in your marriage.
[time=3435] And he's gonna show you how to do that.
[time=3438] So that ultimately we could just say as women, God, I delight to do your will.
[time=3444] Your law is written across my heart.
[time=3447] - Amen.
[time=3449] [AMEN] Well, would you all stand?
[time=3453] And Karen, would you just actually close this in prayer this morning?
[time=3456] Would you do that?
[time=3457] Thank you.
[time=3458] - Lord, thank you for this beautiful body of believers, men and women.
[time=3463] You tell us that you've placed one each here by your design and we couldn't do it without each other.
[time=3470] And you have special calling for each of us and special gifts and special places of response to you.
[time=3478] And oh God, I thank you for the men that you're growing in confidence and courage and leadership through your grace.
[time=3486] And God, would you just help us as women to be the kind of women that would really ignite our husbands to love you more and want to walk in your ways.
[time=3498] And that our love for them, Lord, would just fuel them in such a way that you would just grow a kingdom of priests and follow us here that would so exalt you.
[time=3510] Lord, forgive us as women when we have gotten in the way of our husband's leading, when we have created fear, when we have created passivity, when we have created confusion for the men in our lives.
[time=3524] And oh God, that we would just delight to do your will and be a joy to you and a joy to the men in our lives.
[time=3532] It's in your name, we pray Jesus.
[time=3534] [AMEN]
