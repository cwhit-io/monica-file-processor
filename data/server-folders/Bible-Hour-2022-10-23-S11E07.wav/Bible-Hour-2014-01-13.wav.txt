[time=30] Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast, it's great to be with you and I'm thankful for these few minutes. These are moments when I just do my very best to remind you to invite you to make sure that you're aware of things going on here at Blackhawk as part of our family, we want you to be aware and more than being aware we want you to be a part of it. And so I want to tell you about a chance that you have coming up in a few weeks here.
[time=60] The dates and the times are going to be here at the bottom of the screen, but it's what we call Grow Groups. That's right, twice a year, we believe it's vitally important that everybody that calls Blackhawk Home come and be a part of one of our Grow Groups.
[time=75] Grow Groups are time restrictive five weeks in length and they give people a chance to jump into a number of different settings, a number of different topics, a number of different teachings, but over the five weeks you're going to have the chance to spiritually and personally grow.
[time=92] You see, we believe if you're not growing, you're dying. We believe if you're not growing in your spiritual understanding of God and His Word and His character and all that He has for you, if you're not growing, you're moving in a different direction and that direction's not good, we want you to grow.
[time=111] And so we've got a faculty of teachers and group leaders, we've got a wonderful offering of Grow Groups coming up here in the next few weeks and I want you to be a part of it.
[time=122] So look at the information here at the bottom of the screen, make sure that you go to our website and sign up, make sure that you come on a Sunday morning and sign up.
[time=132] There's a number of different ways that you can do it, but most importantly, we want you to be growing in your understanding of who God is and all that He has for you.
[time=142] We're so grateful for each and every one of you and we hope this is something that you'll take us up on and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=150] We're thankful for the relationship that God has given us with you and I hope you have a great, great week. God bless and we'll see you soon.

[time=763] Welcome back to what is week three of our series that we've entitled real men every January at black off we just take about a month and kind of dig in and make an investment the best investment we can into the family. And this year we've decided to make that investment in our men and our women ladies your insert today in the bulletin again prepared by Karen Beck is filled with tremendous insights for you as you kind of make your way through this message this morning.
[time=792] I hope you'll hear what God has to say to you through me and the scriptures but I also hope ladies that you'll look at that insert and use that as a guide not only this morning but even as the week progresses and as the days move forward.
[time=806] But we're here in week three we saw in week one that according to God's word in God's design when it comes to biblical manhood real men love.
[time=817] We saw in week two that real men lead and this morning we come to the fact that real men in God's design serve real men serve but before we jump into that I want to say this to all of you younger ladies in the room younger.
[time=833] I'm not putting an age range there and maybe it's not even younger really this is just something I want to say to any of you ladies in the room that might be thinking about getting married.
[time=846] You may be 20 and thinking about getting married you might be 16 and thinking about getting married stop it if you are.
[time=856] You might be 30 or 40 maybe thinking about getting married again I don't know what your situation is but I want to say this before we go any further to any of you ladies in the room who are thinking about a future possibly with a man.
[time=874] Gals let me just say this to you as honestly and as straightforwardly as I can it would be our advice to you it would be my my heart's desire for you that you would one day give your heart as a woman that you would give your heart to a man.
[time=893] Girls let me make this clear don't give your heart to a boy give your heart someday to a man a man whose manhood is defined not by our culture not by your feelings not by what others say about him but all that you would one day give your heart to a man
[time=921] as defined by the scriptures our advice to you our hope for you our prayer for you ladies is that you would one day give your heart to a real man who was ready and willing not to listen I got guys in the room right now going you're killing me
[time=940] I'll never be all of that no listen here's what I'm talking about I'm talking about a young man who has that as his desire I'm talking about a young man who has that real manhood as defined by God as his highest priority
[time=958] I know what that guy looks like they're recognizable and that is our hope for you and I can tell you as one fifty years old twenty six years in ministry I've sat with a lot of couples I've sat with a lot of women
[time=974] I've sat across the table in my office I've sat in restaurant booths with a lot of women who settled who gave their heart to somebody who really wasn't characterized by not talking perfect I'm talking
[time=992] characterized by these principles I've sat with many of those women whose lives three years five years seven years down the road filled with heartache and regret and remorse and struggle and yes God is big enough to see you through that struggle but
[time=1010] I'm just telling you while you have a choice our hope is that you would choose to one day give your heart to a man who loves God and who loves you loves you and he leads you and he serves you and he sanctifies you we're going to get into more of that this morning but
[time=1028] that's my encouragement to you ladies it's also my encouragement to you young men you young men in the room don't you dare ask for the heart of a young lady until you're ready to be this man amen don't you dare take from her that which once taken is possible to give back don't don't go down that road guys
[time=1057] until you've done the hard work of character building of integrity God honoring living that's going to allow you to be the man and the husband and maybe one day of the dad that God's designed you to be let's keep studying let's keep looking guys
[time=1076] when you were young question for you this morning when you were young who do you want to be like when you were a little kid who do you look up to boys always idolize somebody I remember when I was eight nine ten eleven twelve most of us remember when we were that age we're always copying we're always boys do this they're always imitating always acting like their favorite cowboy they're they're always acting like their favorite ball player boys do this they mimic
[time=1105] they copy they walk around the room they go out in the driveway they're in the backyard and they're acting like this guy that they really want to be like it might be a superhero from the beginning of super heroes little boys have always wanted to be one music stars
[time=1122] I remember being I remember being seven years old this is painful but here it is right here I remember being seven years old my goodness those ears I those these ears are those ears I had these years when I was seven I would spend hours and hours on the driveway shooting jump shots trying to be like the greatest guard who ever played the game Jerry West there he is right there I even thought I looked like him at one point
[time=1151] it's why I wore my hair that way boy morning noon and night summer fall winter didn't matter how hot it was how cold it was I would be out there pretending like I was the announcer pretending like I was Jerry West pretending like I was hitting game winning shot after game winning shot
[time=1169] Oh how I wanted to be Jerry West boys are like this dads you might even want to ask your boy you might even want to ask your boy who do you want to be like I used to dress up like Wilts Chamberlain to I had a headband but I figured I looked more like Jerry West than Wilt
[time=1188] but you might want to ask your your your sons who they're trying to be like the truth is listen boys become men and don't let anyone fool you men still copy and imitate grown men still have idols we're all still very prone to emulating somebody
[time=1212] and my question for you this morning men in the room young men old men and every guy in between my question for you this morning is this who are you trying to be like who are you trying to be like who are you copying who are you emulating
[time=1229] and there is an answer to that question every one of us is trying to be like somebody and it's abundantly clear to me how our culture today would want you to answer that question because our culture defines manhood as power our culture defines manhood as the ability to experience pleasure
[time=1248] our culture said man has manhoods about dominance our culture our society today says that manhood is about getting it's about having
[time=1258] but what did I tell you in week one I stood here on this stage three weeks ago and I told you that as we made our way through this teaching we don't take our cues about manhood from culture amen
[time=1275] we don't look to culture for direction we're not guided by culture we want to be as men guided by the principles of scripture by the life changing truth of God's Word and God's Word says to each and every man in this room this morning that men should real men should imitate
[time=1296] Jesus there you go there's an idol there's one worth emulating there's one that you can mimic and copy real men that's right should want to be like Christ we see it all over God's Word certainly all of us in the room
[time=1317] who have a faith in Christ are called to follow but let's make specific application this morning to men look if you've got your Bibles open them up to 1 John 2 if you're following along on your phone or your tablet that's great go to 1 John 2 verse 6 the scriptures are filled with exhortation and admonishment and direction for us in this case for us men in the room this morning to be like Christ
[time=1345] to copy him by this we know 1 John 2 5 by this we know that we are in him verse 6 says the one who says he abides in him ought himself to walk in the same manner to walk in the same manner means to think in the same manner it means to choose in the same manner it means to value in the same manner it means to be in the same manner right there verse 6
[time=1373] if you say you abide in him you ought yourself to walk in the same manner as he walked copying emulating mimicking him guys you ought to want to be like Christ go to Philippians go back to the other end of your New Testament Paul's letter to the church at Philippi same thing same admonishment same exhortation
[time=1401] here we see it again Philippians 2 I want to pick it up in verse 3 there's some things he wants you to do guys there's some things he wants our lives to be characterized by and watch how he brings Christ into it do nothing verse 3 do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourself
[time=1429] don't merely look out for your own personal interest talk about counterculture don't merely look out for your own personal interest but also for the interests of others
[time=1441] have this attitude everything said in verses 3 and 4 have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus have his attitude look at it his way do it the way he did it
[time=1455] who although he existed in the form of God he had plenty of privilege and he had all the rights in the world did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped he empties himself and he serves look at John go to the gospel
[time=1474] go to the gospel of John let's start in John like a John 13 go to John 1334 John 1334 I love this so simple so basic so powerful a new commandment Jesus says I give to you that you love one another
[time=1498] that you really love each other even as I have loved you that you also love one another by this all men will know that you are my disciples if you mimic me if you copy me if you do what I did I loved you I loved you deeply I loved you faithfully do the same thing copy me be like me
[time=1524] I love how he brings this to light go back just a few verses same chapter John 13 verse 12 yeah John 1312 when he had washed their feet what great service what great humility when he had washed their feet and taken his garments and reclined at the table again he said to them do you know what I have done to you
[time=1552] you call me teacher and Lord and you are right for so I am if then the Lord and the teacher washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet
[time=1565] for I give you here it is for I gave you an example right there Jesus says it there I am I'm giving you something to follow I'm giving you something to copy copy me follow me do what I do
[time=1578] I gave you an example that you also should do as I did to you
[time=1585] The Bible filled with admonition and exhortation for us to copy the Lord in fact the Apostle Paul just flat out said it in 1 Corinthians 11 he said imitate me as I imitate Christ
[time=1599] and so men in the room this morning those of you men listening online those of you watching the broadcast guess what of all the things that Jesus did I want you to write this down
[time=1612] we're going to keep it real simple and write along these lines this morning of all the things Jesus did and he did many things of all the things he did he served
[time=1622] and this morning I want to invite you to copy him this morning men I want to invite you to follow him this morning men young and old and every guy in between I want to invite you to be a man who like Jesus serves
[time=1640] He met the real physical spiritual personal needs of those whose lives intersected with his oh what your life would be like guys oh what your life would be like what my life would be like if we were willing and ready and positioned
[time=1663] and pointed toward meeting the real physical spiritual personal needs of those whose lives intersected with ours Jesus did he served here you go three things he served always
[time=1675] hope you'll write these down he served always he served anyone and he served at great personal cost he served always he served anyone he served at great personal cost
[time=1692] let's jump in there with always and I want to just set the stage I want to give you two scenarios I could give you 12 but I'm going to just give you two look at John the gospel of John go to chapter two
[time=1703] back at the beginning of this gospel there's this really interesting scene we won't study the whole thing I want to just set the stage for you on the third day it says there in John 2 verse 1 on the third day there was a wedding
[time=1718] in cana of Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there and both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding just hold on to that he gets invited to a wedding
[time=1733] he's Jesus and there is disciples and there's all this ministry that's going on and will continue to go forward but he got invited to a wedding got invited to a wedding
[time=1749] go just hang on here go a few more pages go to John 4 I don't know what you like about weddings guys I'm not sure I think most of us would just say that sometimes it's just nice to take a break sometimes just nice to be with friends and family sometimes just nice to kind of relax and be at a wedding we'll come back to that John 4
[time=1772] what a story this is again we're not going to get into all of it he left Judea and went away again into Galilee and in his way in his trip and his travels to Galilee he decides he's going to pass through Samaria it was hard walking quite a journey
[time=1790] he came to the city of Samaria verse 5 he came to the city of Samaria called Saikar near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph and verse 6 and Jacob's well was there so Jesus being wearied from his journey the guy had been walking most of the day was sitting thus by the well it was about the sixth hour
[time=1812] midday he's been walking he's tired he's just really thirsty he just wants some water guys in the room we all know what it's like to be off the clock don't we
[time=1825] something in us guys we sort of kind of lived for that we love being off the clock to be looking forward to some downtime to be tired to be weary to be in need of just a little window of no pressure no expectation no demands
[time=1841] Jesus was going to a wedding in John 2 and in John 4 he's tired and he just wants some water and in both situations the opportunity to meet a need presents itself the wine dries up at the wedding some of you know the story no more wine the parties
[time=1863] about to die and his mom comes and some might not think it a big deal but it's really actually the first miracle of his earthly ministry a family friends wedding party is about to die in a desperate immoral thirsty woman is in need of real life getting getting water in John 4
[time=1881] and as you watch him turn the water into wine as you watch him oh you should read John 4 again and watch the way he rolls his sleeves up with this woman in John 4 the questions that he asks the effort that he gives
[time=1896] the conversation that he has what his he goes from tired and thirsty to full on kingdom advancement engagement with her oh he serves her and we see just in these two examples that he's really never off the clock
[time=1913] his serving antenna are up always yes there were times he slipped away in private that's true but when he comes back into his world and his life the antenna are up his willingness to help his constant his readiness to extend
[time=1931] himself is normative it's not the exception it's the rule guys is it this way with you let me just ask you this morning is it this way with you does this characterize your antenna is this your posture
[time=1948] toward your wife toward your kids toward your friends toward those that God brings across your path are you hungry to serve guys are you energized by the thought of helping
[time=1962] when the need presents itself are you looking for ways to extend your time and your efforts you know what truth be told your wife your wife should sense this in you
[time=1976] and I know what it's like when a wife doesn't sense that in us she should sense the willingness and the readiness your kids should see it they should just kind of look up each day and see that being a characteristic
[time=1999] that you genuinely honestly faithfully portray to them your friend should encounter it at every turn how can I help what can I do what need can I meet either these are the words or this is the mindset but either way it's what comes across
[time=2018] as those you care about most interact with you guys be like guys be like Jesus and yes he'll be there to hold you up when you're not I know that for a fact because I know I'm not but we're talking about
[time=2038] where you're headed we're talking about your priority we're talking about that which drives you be like Jesus who said I came not to be what say it he said I came not to be what and just be honest guys we love to be served
[time=2053] I think it's part of our fallenness I think it's part of our gender it's just part of being a guy something about being a guy we just love to be served I know good godly women I know good godly people who love to serve
[time=2067] that's a good thing serving is a good thing we're talking about it this morning there's something though about us men at the core of our being sometimes we like it too much sometimes we demand it too much sometimes we live by that too often
[time=2082] and Jesus said no be like me I came not to be served but to what to serve to give my life away he said a ransom for many guys will you serve always
[time=2099] when you serve when it's convenient and when it's inconvenient guys will you serve when it's planned and even when it's not guys will you serve when it fits into your day or when it fits into your evening or even when it doesn't
[time=2116] and yes most certainly hear me I believe that there are limits yes most certainly there were times hear me when Jesus went away and he refuels and he recalibrates but when he steps back on the scene the antenna are up the sleeves are rolled up and there is this willingness to give
[time=2137] Jesus served always Jesus served anyone a lot of examples of this I want to just give you a fantastic example of his willingness to serve anyone even when it was most certainly difficult look at mark five
[time=2152] look at mark five chapter one mark five verse one here Jesus gets away he and the guys they've been doing ministry they hop in the boat they go to the other side of the sea into the country of Jaresanese it's an interesting place over on the other side they came it says in the boat they came to the other side of the sea mark five one into the country of the Jaresanese when he got out of the boat
[time=2181] immediately notice the wording when he got out of the boat immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit a demon possessed dude from the caves meets him when he gets out of the boat and he had his dwelling
[time=2199] among the tombs and no one was able to bind him anymore even with a chain because he had been he had often been bound with shackles and chains and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles broken in pieces
[time=2214] by him and no one was strong enough to subdue this guy constantly night and day he was screaming among the tombs and in the mountains and gashing himself with stones
[time=2227] this is the welcoming committee over on the other side seeing Jesus from a distance he runs up and bowed down before him shouting with a loud voice he said what business do we have with each other Jesus son of the most high
[time=2243] God I implore you by God do not torment me
[time=2250] I had a wife come up to me after first hour and said my goodness that sounds like me some days she was kidding and no man in here will probably ever experience this but every man in this room experiences somebody in your life who it is very difficult to serve
[time=2272] they are testing they are trying they are rude they are out of line they are out of place they do not go about it right there is something wrong with them they have been the source of pain they have been the source of confusion
[time=2290] they have been the source of this they have been the source of that Jesus here does what Jesus does he deals with this man he deals with him wisely he does not send them away he could have he does not ignore him he could have
[time=2306] his ministry in this man's life and all what a mess all what a wreck all what a difficult individual this guy must have been thinking about it this week I can't think of anything uglier can't think of anything more pathetic or destructive or distasteful
[time=2331] than prejudice I hate it and then God hates it and then he goes against his character and his nature with holding kindness refusing service refusing to extend goodness denying respect not helping not coming alongside instead being cold being cruel
[time=2355] being hateful and or indifferent just because someone's what poor just because someone's what socially awkward handicapped black white brown unemployed
[time=2379] begging difficult to be with men man real men trying to imitate Jesus place no conditions on those they will serve to be served by a real God honoring man you don't have to look a certain way drive a certain car have
[time=2408] a certain degree or come from the right zip code you simply have to possess a need because a real man will serve anyone anyone always guys I would invite you on this point to just write a name down I hope you'll
[time=2428] do it right now hope you'll write the name down of somebody in your world who quite honestly quite honestly they represent for you a challenge quite honestly you sometimes when they're running to the boat to greet you you honestly sometimes want to just go the other way
[time=2448] sometimes it's someone who you know has the power to hurt you sometimes it's someone who you know has the capacity to ruin a day but maybe this morning you would see that individual through the eyes of Christ maybe this morning you'd be willing to write a name down
[time=2463] and actually serve them in the way Jesus did Jesus served always Jesus served anyone and he served at personal cost at great personal cost my friends please don't forget the crucifixion this morning
[time=2482] don't forget the crucifixion was the ultimate act of service Jesus dying on the cross was the ultimate act of serving Jesus served you he met your need that day by dying on the cross and while on the cross at the end of what's an excruciating unspeakable act of kindness
[time=2506] Jesus utters these final words look at Matthew 27 would you turn in your bibles look on your phone or your tablet look at 2745 remember this he's on the cross what a day what a night and what a morning he has experienced he has been beaten
[time=2529] beyond recognition the mistreatment the awful experience it's something most of us in the room are familiar with in terms of our knowledge of what he had gone through now it says in verse 45 hanging there on the cross now from the sixth
[time=2544] hour just in case you're interested the sixth hour would be about noon and so from noon darkness fell upon the land until 3 p.m. from noon to 3 that day it goes dark completely and absolutely dark and there he hangs on the cross in this ultimate
[time=2568] act of service for you and for me and it says darkness fell upon the land until the ninth hour about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice Elle Elle llama sabachthani
[time=2582] Elle Elle llama sabachthani he cries it out. Elle Elle llama sabachthani which is my god my dad my father my god why have you what say it church forsaken me man in the room this morning let me remind you of this because so many times guys you and I we want our service so many times we want our our
[time=2610] willingness to give so many times we connect it to how we feel and so many times we say I don't feel like it so many times we say I don't know if I'm really into that right here today I don't know if I feel like it.
[time=2628] Well let me tell you in our effort to be like him this morning he felt in that moment I'm sure he felt unspeakable loneliness he felt mistreated he felt abandoned even by his father he felt abused he felt hurt he felt misunderstood
[time=2645] he felt taken advantage of and he felt disrespected and he could have gotten off the cross and called it a day but he didn't so feeling doesn't trump service
[time=2665] the darkest point feeling things you and I will never understand he served he served straight ahead he served straight through he served faithfully at great personal cost a cost neither you or I will ever have to pay which was his life
[time=2687] would be men willing to serve anyone willing to serve always willing to serve as men at great personal cost
[time=2699] Hey I want to invite a friend to come up and Irake if you'd make your way up here Irake Headley's a good friend of mine he and Tamara are part of our family as is Irake's mom Hannah
[time=2711] Irake and Tamara have been married about eight years couple of boys that I think you'll see here on the screen in a little bit and I've asked Irake to come up and just share a few things about his journey guys toward manhood
[time=2726] in a lot of ways Irake and I share a very similar story and I'll let him just say a little bit about that but I want you to understand this is just an effort on our part
[time=2737] what culture you're a part of doesn't matter where you grew up doesn't matter what zip code you're from it doesn't matter what your dad did or didn't do all of us are influenced by our cultures
[time=2748] and most of the time our cultures get it wrong and all of the time the one thing that brings it together is the gospel and the truth that God gives us regarding manhood so Irake good to see you everybody say hello to Irake
[time=2764] what's happened at Black Hawk Irake tell tell everybody first of all just you and I have some similarities yes you're a little tanner than I am
[time=2776] yeah it's a little but our dads were pastors yes and in watching our dads do ministry we both kind of cut the same message early on about serving yes and it got a little sideways but just explain it in your own words what you grew up with when it came
[time=2793] to a man and his serving wow great question the serving as a Christ following man or a pastor growing up was very simple to me it was you serve the church not really the family not really your wife as Kelly's talking about not really our children
[time=2815] but very simply put you serve the church and what that look like was ours at the office hours away from home and your family kind of got your left over so growing up it was very clear to me that if I wanted to be a godly man
[time=2831] that was to that was the prerequisite was service to the church never really model to the wife and the children yeah sometimes even in ministry people get that wrong sometimes even in God's work that gets all sideways and causes damage
[time=2848] I know you grew up in Trinidad yes the bago and you came to Fort Wayne when you were 11 11 yeah just turned 11 I came to Fort Wayne in October of 89 flew into Chicago which I thought was like brutally cold that was a setup in my opinion
[time=2866] and yeah came in 89 just turned 11 and my definition of manhood changed because my parents actually got a divorce soon after we came to America and my definition changed because of my exposure to the so-called hood of Fort Wayne the so-called ghetto
[time=2885] there's not really a ghetto in Fort Wayne the true definition but there's a maybe a low income area maybe a so-called hood but my definition changed and I started to gravitate towards that definition and I think the the American media has really painted a picture that
[time=2904] the culture that has affected the African American community is everybody every black male is bad every black male does not love his family every black male is scary every black male can harm you
[time=2920] and I think the first thing that we need to understand as a country and a humanity for lack of a better term is that cultures affect us cultures are living organisms that consistently change and to understand what the African American community is going through we have to understand a culture that has infiltrated the African American community and affected the black males most more than anybody else
[time=2946] and rappers let's talk about rappers there's a rapper named Eminem who's actually a white male and wait why guys can rap that's what they tell me man I'd you know I and jump I don't think we can jump and now I know I don't know about the dance thing yet but to wrap the jump we got that figured out
[time=2965] so Eminem has has defined manhood through his message of rap music that manhood is domination and brutality he talks about women about beating women he talks about beating homosexuals rage hate crimes and he defines manhood through his message as domination and brutality
[time=2988] another rapper by the name of Kanye West if you listen to Kanye West raise your hand raise your hand no just kidding don't do it somebody raise their handbag we got talked to this guy but Kanye West actually defines manhood through his message as ego
[time=3003] the higher you can elevate yourself over another human being especially another black male the better of a man you are and that leads to the materialism that leads to the got to get the car got to get the newest newest gear to get the newest shoes the ego
[time=3019] and then the last guy that I'll talk to talk about today is a guy by the name of 50 Cent who portrays and defines manhood as survival he was shot nine times he survived and that's his that's that's his messages
[time=3033] for you to be a man you have to be tough you have to be calloused you have to be able to survive a shooting like I did so I to answer the question Kelly I gravitated towards that definition of manhood the hard
[time=3048] the callister I'm tough I can survive this I can be on the streets and be tough and survive and in their defense and in our defense you cannot survive in a violent atmosphere of violent environment without being tough
[time=3065] I know the elephant is not the king of the jungle the lion is because he is the toughest he's the god it does the most killing and I think that is what has infiltrated and affected so many of us as young black Americans
[time=3078] when was it iric that you first heard or saw the message of God regarding manhood right intersecting with that world you were kind of coming out of when did all that start to come together for you
[time=3093] I started from watching from watching some positive black males and some Christ following black males in my opinion being positive is just not enough because positive changes from your perception of positive
[time=3106] but watching other black males there was a man who really took me under his wing named Herbert Lyons and watching that black male and seeing him love his wife seeing him love his family seeing him have that actual balance of serving at his church but also
[time=3122] that was a huge deal and then other other guys you know at black harka Denny how is a huge influence that is really educated that extension of manhood
[time=3136] great job on Denny's part that's good and then you mentioned first hour and I want to mention this you can speak to it again but I want to just make sure you all catch this even though you saw a good example it never really got
[time=3147] internalized until you gave my life to Christ I saw a great example but it actually it never grew it never it never was harvested until I gave my life to Christ it meant nothing it was more of an irritation
[time=3161] and in me dealing with young black males today I will always have to rewind and remember where I was when I try to approach them to say hey man they're not really interested at this time but maybe one day
[time=3174] it will be harvested and something to change in their lives like it did in my man and I want to just make sure that we just real quick I want you to not miss this guys in the room
[time=3185] you can listen to all five weeks of real men guys you can be drawn to the principles that we try to put out here in front of you in these talks on Sunday mornings
[time=3195] much of what we're talking about hopefully all of it sounds right and good to you none of it will ever make its way into your life it will never change you you will never be a real man as defined by God until your heart and soul are transformed
[time=3211] by the gospel until you come to faith in Christ until you fully surrender your heart and life to him see when that happens now all of a sudden the truths and the examples and the principles all of that can now have an avenue through which to work its way into and through your life
[time=3230] thank God for what he's done in iraq's life thank God for the chance he now has to pass it on to those two precious boys that you've seen on the screen and would you thank iraq for being here this morning
