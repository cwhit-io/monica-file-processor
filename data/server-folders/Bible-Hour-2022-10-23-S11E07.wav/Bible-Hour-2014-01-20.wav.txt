[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=31] Well, good morning and welcome to the broadcast on a snowy Sunday morning.
[time=38] It just keeps getting cold again when we think it's going to warm up.
[time=42] But we are grateful for a Sunday morning and a chance to continue weather and all in this series that we've entitled Real Men.
[time=51] And I want to just say something to all of you who are watching.
[time=54] I've heard from many of you over the last few weeks.
[time=57] I know that the conversation that we've been having and the teaching that's been going on has been encouraging and helpful to many of you.
[time=65] It's really encouraging for us to hear from you on that front.
[time=69] I also want you to know this, that this next Sunday, the second of February, when most of you are watching this, both hours here at Black Hawk.
[time=79] I want to invite you to, if you don't have plans, get in the car and come and join us.
[time=83] We're going to have a special Sunday where we worship together as men and women.
[time=88] But then we're going to take our men and we're going to go down to our gym.
[time=91] We're going to leave the women in the worship center.
[time=93] Karen Beck is going to be teaching our women that morning.
[time=96] And all the guys are going to go to the gym and Josh Rang and Jesse Hannah and myself and Steve Webster, our teaching team.
[time=104] We're going to have a really special time of kind of looking back at this series and inviting our men to make some commitments.
[time=112] Inviting our men to consider going forward from this series in a new and special way.
[time=118] So I hope you'll come and be a part of it with us.
[time=120] It's going to be a great Sunday, both hours, 9 and 1045 as we conclude our series on real men.
[time=127] And then the following week, we're going to have a tremendous time together as a church family reflecting on what God's been teaching us over these five weeks.
[time=136] And on the 16th of February, we begin our new series.
[time=141] It is going to be a study of the book of Jonah.
[time=145] And many of you know the story of Jonah and the whale, the big fish.
[time=149] Many of you sort of know the idea of God calling Jonah to do something, to go to Nineveh.
[time=154] And Jonah says no.
[time=156] Many of us have lived in that tension of God wanting us to do this, but we want to do that.
[time=162] And how does all that work out? And what do we learn from Jonah's failure?
[time=166] I hope you'll come and be with us as we look at this amazing story of Jonah and God's call on his life.
[time=173] Thank you so much for tuning in today.
[time=175] It's great to have you as part of our family. We love you.
[time=178] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=192] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=207] And I walk, and I walk through the fire with my head lifting high
[time=215] and my spirit revived the old story.
[time=222] And I'll look to the cross as my failure is lost
[time=229] in the light of your glorious grace so that the blue has come to light with the beauty of your name rising up from the ashes and forever you reign and my soul will find refuge in the shadow of your wings I will love you forever and forever I'll sing the ruins come to light and the beauty of your name rising up from the ashes and forever you reign and my soul will find refuge in the shadow of your wings I will love you forever and forever I'll sing
[time=300] Well, good morning again.
[time=302] Great to see more of you making your way in.
[time=305] Really grateful for the effort driving in today.
[time=308] The kids were in the car with me and they're thinking, "Dad, no one's coming." One of them was going to sit over here and one of them was going to sit up there and they said, "We'll make you feel at home." But look at all of you.
[time=319] You're here and we're grateful that you're here and I'm really thankful that we get to have this time together.
[time=324] If you've been around Blackhawk at all in recent weeks, you know that we have been engaging in this series that we've entitled "Real Men." We believe God has a design for men, a role for us to play in our lives and in the lives of those that we love and share life with.
[time=342] And it has been an encouraging three weeks.
[time=344] I'm so grateful.
[time=345] I know all of us up here are for the feedback that we've received, your notes, your letters, your emails, your texts, the things that we've been hearing of what God's doing in your heart and life.
[time=357] Men and women, most of you ladies know that each week we've been providing you via Karen Beck and her efforts to help.
[time=366] And again this week, gals, you'll find a sheet for you in the bulletin.
[time=370] Karen has been providing each week some things for you to think about, some things for you to ask yourself, some truth for you to consider.
[time=378] And so we hope again this week, ladies, as we come to week four that you'll enjoy that.
[time=382] Don't forget next week, week five, kind of our wrap up, our conclusion to the series.
[time=387] We're all gonna meet together in here both hours at the beginning and then we're gonna split up, guys.
[time=393] We're gonna take you down to the gym.
[time=394] Gals are gonna stay in here and Karen's gonna be here and is gonna teach kind of a women's perspective.
[time=400] Look back on the four weeks of Real Men and give you some things to consider.
[time=404] And it's gonna be a great, great morning.
[time=406] I am joined today by some guys that I'm deeply grateful for.
[time=411] I am, as you know, thankful at Black Hawk that we believe in plurality.
[time=415] We believe in the gifting and the strengths of others, not just one.
[time=420] And so our teaching here at Black Hawk really is the responsibility of a teaching team.
[time=425] And I'm thankful that I get to be a part of that on a regular basis, so thankful for our elders and their leadership in that endeavor.
[time=433] And I couldn't be more thankful to have Josh, Rang, and Steve Webster, and Jesse Hanna joining me this morning and we want to together as a team talk about how Real Men sanctify.
[time=446] Week one, we saw that Real Men love.
[time=448] Week two, we talked about how Real Men lead.
[time=451] Last week, we looked at the fact that Real Men, designed by God, serve.
[time=456] They give themselves an offering to others.
[time=459] And this morning, we come to this idea of sanctification.
[time=462] Real men sanctify.
[time=465] Which simply stated means that in God's design for men, and I hope you'll write this down, a God honoring man participates in the sanctification process that God is working out in the lives of others.
[time=479] Operative word there would be participates.
[time=481] Please hear us.
[time=482] We believe firmly that God sanctifies people.
[time=486] God sanctifies men.
[time=488] God sanctifies their wives.
[time=490] God's about sanctifying their families.
[time=492] It's the work of God and the spirit of God and the word of God that sanctifies the body of Christ.
[time=499] But men, we believe and we're here to share with you today that we think you have a unique opportunity to participate with God in the sanctification process that he is doing in the lives of people.
[time=512] God is doing a sanctifying work in the life of your wife, your kids, your friends, those in your local church.
[time=519] And real men will with sleeves rolled up faithfully
[time=526] and diligently they will involve themselves in those sanctifying efforts.
[time=531] And I can't wait for you to learn more and understand more about this today before we go forward.
[time=536] Let me just have Jesse and Steve both say a couple of things to you about sanctification.
[time=541] I say sanctification.
[time=543] Some of you in the room know exactly what I'm talking about, but there might be some of you, and we're glad that you're here learning along with this.
[time=550] There might be some of you who don't understand that or who would like to understand that better for the sake of this discussion.
[time=556] So, Jesse, give them some thoughts on what this sanctification idea is really all about.
[time=562] Yeah, when I think of the word sanctification, I was like this really big churchy word.
[time=566] It just feels churchy.
[time=568] And I also, I Googled a picture and I found, it just makes me think of monks.
[time=574] Like, they're just kind of off and they're sanctifying them.
[time=577] So, they've kind of separated themselves out.
[time=579] It's kind of like a duck dynasty.
[time=581] Yeah, duck dynasty sanctification.
[time=583] Definitely.
[time=585] Yeah.
[time=586] I mean, it could be fun for a weekend to try it.
[time=588] I don't know.
[time=589] But that's what I think of, and I think sanctification is just basically it's just this process.
[time=593] This is moment by moment process of just growing into the likeness of Christ.
[time=597] I'm not sure why we put this big word on it, but that's what it is, but it's just growing.
[time=601] It's just taking steps closer to Christ, making those changes in your life, adding to taking away from like you're going to share in a minute, just growing in the likeness of Christ.
[time=612] That's kind of what I, when I think of sanctification, it's a moment by moment on the ongoing process from the time you are born in Christ to the time you pass away and go up to see Him.
[time=623] So that's...
[time=624] Never stops.
[time=625] Nope.
[time=626] Always ongoing.
[time=627] Yeah.
[time=628] Yeah, it's good.
[time=629] Very good.
[time=630] There's a positive and negative dimension to it where you're putting off things, you're putting on things.
[time=635] In 1 Peter 3, 15, it says, "But in your hearts, and in the NASB it says, "And your hearts sanctify Christ as Lord." That word's also translated to set apart as revere, as honor.
[time=646] So when you set apart and you honor Christ as holy, that manifests itself in your life.
[time=653] And it goes on to say in verse 16 that this good behavior will flow out of what it is that God is doing in you.
[time=659] And as the years go by, things get left behind, things get added on.
[time=664] So I think oftentimes we see it as a negative, but we have to also do the positive side as well that He's putting dimensions on to our holiness year by year, day by day.
[time=675] Good question to ask yourself in 2014, is, "Am I more like Jesus at the end of the year than I am right now?" Kind of a sanctification test.
[time=685] Set apart from some things.
[time=687] To something.
[time=688] When you say there's negative connotations to sanctification, what do you mean by that?
[time=692] I mean, but there are things that will be stripped away.
[time=694] There is that dead, those dead things that will be cut off, like dead branches will be pruned off.
[time=700] The guy, that pruning work in our lives will be taking place.
[time=703] That's a negative.
[time=704] That can hurt sometimes.
[time=705] But the positive aspect is also really important that he's going to be adding to the fruit of the spirit will be more, more manifest in our life, day by day.
[time=712] Good.
[time=713] So we've just put together kind of a four point outline to our discussion today.
[time=718] I hope you can follow along.
[time=719] I hope you can take some notes.
[time=721] We hope more than anything that it's helpful.
[time=723] And the way we've done this is we believe real men sanctify.
[time=727] They participate with God in the sanctification process.
[time=730] They sanctify themselves.
[time=732] Josh is going to talk about that.
[time=734] They sanctify their wives.
[time=736] Jesse's going to address that.
[time=738] They sanctify their kids, their families.
[time=741] And Webby's going to talk about that.
[time=743] And real men sanctify those in their local church.
[time=746] And I'll talk a little bit about that at the end.
[time=749] So Josh, get us going.
[time=750] Real men sanctify themselves.
[time=752] So grab your Bible and get to second Peter chapter one.
[time=755] Or if you've got an iPod or iPad.
[time=759] iPhone.
[time=760] I still don't have any of that stuff.
[time=762] But I'm learning to talk the lingo.
[time=764] iPhone.
[time=765] Could be an iPhone.
[time=766] I forgot to say it.
[time=767] I forgot.
[time=768] Monk dynasty.
[time=770] That'd be good.
[time=771] Sorry.
[time=772] I had to say it.
[time=773] I'm a firm believer as I just begin to take in more and more of the scriptures.
[time=778] That behavior follows belief.
[time=783] And so if I believe that there's ice cream in the freezer.
[time=788] And if I believe that it's going to make me happy.
[time=791] And if I believe that it's even good for me.
[time=794] Then that seals the deal.
[time=795] And that's going to lead to a behavior that says no matter what time.
[time=800] I'm going to go down and I'm going to get that ice cream.
[time=804] And the same is true as we look at just the behavior that God is calling us to.
[time=809] That again behavior follows belief.
[time=812] I think it is stated clearly here in second Peter chapter one.
[time=816] Starting in verse three.
[time=818] So it says this.
[time=819] His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness.
[time=825] Through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence.
[time=829] By which he's granted to us his precious and very great promises.
[time=834] Stop right there from it.
[time=835] So it doesn't just say promises.
[time=838] It's precious promises.
[time=840] And it doesn't just say great promises but very great promises.
[time=845] And so these promises are really important.
[time=848] So it's these promises as it says that through them these promises.
[time=854] You may become partakers of the divine nature.
[time=858] And that's simply a phrase that talks about sanctification.
[time=862] As we think about participating in God's divine nature.
[time=866] Big theological term there's communicable attributes and excommunicable attributes.
[time=872] Communicable attributes of God are those things that we can actually copy to some extent.
[time=878] We know that God is loving and we can be loving as well.
[time=882] We're not going to love perfectly as he loves.
[time=885] We can still participate in his nature as we would love one another.
[time=890] The excommunicable are those attributes of God that try as hard as you want.
[time=896] It's just not going to happen.
[time=897] So God is omnipresent.
[time=899] He's everywhere.
[time=900] It's just, I can't do that.
[time=902] None of us can do that, right?
[time=904] But there are communicable attributes that we can participate in.
[time=908] And as you look at what this does, this is the positive side.
[time=911] As these promises, these precious and very great promises, through them you become partakers of the divine nature.
[time=919] The positive side.
[time=920] The next phrase is the negative side of it.
[time=923] Those things that are stripped away.
[time=925] Having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.
[time=931] And so, man, as you think about participating in the sanctifications of God in your own life,
[time=938] I just ask you to believe, receive, and live in the good of God's promises.
[time=944] Let's talk about these very great promises, first of all.
[time=947] There's real promises that God offers and there's empty promises that the world offers.
[time=954] These real promises would be his presence.
[time=957] He said, "I'll never leave you nor forsake you." His real promise of his provision.
[time=963] He says, "I'm going to provide for you.
[time=965] I provided for the birds. I'm going to provide for you." You know, go back to his presence.
[time=971] It reminds me of Philippians 4.
[time=973] Most of us would know Philippians 4, 6, that says, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything with prayer and tradition, present your request with God." Some of us don't realize the phrase before that.
[time=985] Is this little phrase that says, "The Lord is at hand." Therefore, do not be anxious about anything.
[time=994] So if you believe that the Lord is present and at hand, that motivates you to not be anxious.
[time=1003] If you do not have the belief that the Lord is hand and it's up to you, that's going to provide a lot of anxiety.
[time=1009] That's going to provide a lot of worry in your life.
[time=1012] And so these promises of his presence, his provision, a secure future, at first Peter 1 would say, in heaven it's guaranteed that our sins are forgiven, that there's no condemnation.
[time=1023] All of those are real promises.
[time=1025] They're precious.
[time=1026] They're very great.
[time=1028] And I believe they yield in our lives peace and rest and humility and giving and selflessness and confession and transparency.
[time=1037] I mean, if I believe that my sins are forgiven, I can be more transparent.
[time=1041] If I believe that God is going to provide for me, I can be more giving.
[time=1045] All of those things, those beliefs yield to those type of behaviors.
[time=1048] But the world is promising empty promises.
[time=1056] This idea that, you know, do whatever it takes to get to the top because that's where you'll find fulfillment.
[time=1063] Get as much in that bank account as you possibly can because then you'll feel secure.
[time=1069] The promise that if you don't love yourself, nobody will love you more.
[time=1074] I mean, all of these empty promises that what it says it leads to corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.
[time=1082] And those sinful desires are desires to find significance or to make sure that
[time=1088] we're comfortable or entertained or all these different things that we pursue.
[time=1092] And so I believe that those empty promises lead to the opposite.
[time=1096] They do lead to anxiety and to pride and to selfishness and to self-preservation and to hiding and to self- atonement.
[time=1104] All those things that are really corrupting ourselves.
[time=1109] Decaying, causing us to be less and less of what God has called us to be.
[time=1114] And so there's these very great promises that we need to believe and rest in.
[time=1119] And then look where first, 2 Peter goes in verse 5.
[time=1123] It says, "For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with all this list of moral qualities." And so I just want you to know that sanctification in and of itself takes some effort and understand that the gospel, the truth, those promises are not opposed to effort, but they are opposed to earning.
[time=1146] To say that my efforts are somehow going to earn these truths.
[time=1151] Not true, but God certainly calls us to effort in our own sanctification.
[time=1157] And one of those efforts that I would say is to embrace, believe, receive,
[time=1164] and live in the good of God's promises.
[time=1167] So maybe something tangible, you know, pick some promises and put them,
[time=1174] you know, tape them to your mirror in the morning.
[time=1176] Have them there, memorize some portions of Scripture.
[time=1180] You know, I truly believe that guilt is a horrible motivator.
[time=1184] But grace is the best motivator.
[time=1188] And so as you, you know, begin to think about looking at yourself in the mirror, and I'm going to grab my prop if any of you guys want to jump in.
[time=1195] I think it's a great, I just leaned over to Webby and said, like, start thinking of promises.
[time=1200] And it's just sitting here listening to Josh again this hour.
[time=1203] I would encourage you.
[time=1204] I mean, what if you just took a few minutes right now?
[time=1206] What if you took some time tonight?
[time=1208] Literally.
[time=1209] And I'm not trying to in any way make you feel bad about what you don't know about the Bible.
[time=1213] It's okay.
[time=1214] We're journeying together here.
[time=1216] But if you were just to write down promises of God toward you from the Scripture,
[time=1222] how long would your list be if you took some time to think about that?
[time=1226] What a great practical suggestion he's just made for you and I to become more aware of the promises of God that are the foundation of our belief which then affects our action.
[time=1237] So when you look at yourself in the mirror every morning, men, have some scripture on there, some promises, but also understand it's not just about what you look like but it's about what you believe and just rest in those very precious and very
[time=1250] great promises as God moves you along in that sanctification process.
[time=1254] That's awesome.
[time=1255] Thanks.
[time=1256] Jesse, Jesse's going to jump in on just some thoughts and some encouragement for us all,
[time=1262] guys, when it comes to the sanctifying of our wives.
[time=1266] Yeah.
[time=1267] Oh, great married one that you are.
[time=1269] You got this, Jesse?
[time=1270] Yeah, I got it all figured out.
[time=1271] All over it.
[time=1272] So I'm going to tell you how to do it.
[time=1274] Not really.
[time=1275] When he told me that I'm like, why did you give me the hard one?
[time=1279] He didn't want to do it.
[time=1280] Okay.
[time=1281] So I'm going to have Webby read a very, would you read that verse for me as you get ready?
[time=1284] I'm going to draw some things.
[time=1285] This helps me think about it and then I'll attach wives to this picture.
[time=1290] I'm not a good artist.
[time=1292] Just fine.
[time=1293] This is Ephesians 2, 1 and 2, and you were dead, and the trespasses and sins in which
[time=1301] you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.
[time=1311] This is supposed to be a cross.
[time=1315] That is.
[time=1316] Thanks.
[time=1317] And this picture is like the scale to this.
[time=1320] We put a little scale down here.
[time=1321] It's like your life.
[time=1322] Okay.
[time=1323] It doesn't look that big.
[time=1326] Okay.
[time=1327] And that's supposed to just keep going.
[time=1328] Okay.
[time=1329] So you were dead, right?
[time=1330] You were dead in your transgressions.
[time=1331] Nothing can happen when you're dead.
[time=1333] You're completely dead.
[time=1334] You can't please God.
[time=1335] It doesn't matter if you help old ladies cross the street.
[time=1337] You're dead to him, right?
[time=1338] You're dead, right?
[time=1339] Webby read the next verse that I asked you to read.
[time=1343] But God, being rich in mercy because of the great love with which he loved us, even when
[time=1350] we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ by grace you have
[time=1356] been saved.
[time=1357] Right.
[time=1358] He didn't leave us here.
[time=1359] He made a way so that we could know him so that we could come alive.
[time=1362] And when, you know, you can call it whatever you want.
[time=1365] You've been redeemed.
[time=1366] You had conversion.
[time=1367] I like to say you stepped across the line and you trusted Jesus with your life.
[time=1371] And if you haven't done that yet, we're so glad you're here.
[time=1374] You're checking that out.
[time=1375] This place is safe, right?
[time=1377] You can ask us some questions about that.
[time=1379] We want to help you understand that.
[time=1380] If you have questions about that, I didn't come -- I didn't do this until I was 17, okay?
[time=1385] So it took me a while.
[time=1386] And I still don't have it all figured out, and that's okay.
[time=1389] So if you're here, we're so glad you're here.
[time=1391] The courage it takes to come to a place like this, a church and just not sure how this all stuff works and we're using some big words.
[time=1397] We want to help you with that.
[time=1398] Hopefully, this picture will help, okay?
[time=1400] So when I was 17, I crossed this line, and this is now -- no, there's another picture, right?
[time=1405] Now, I'm happy because I have Jesus, right?
[time=1408] I'm not saying life is just -- everything's great now, I'm just saying this is for the picture, right?
[time=1413] So now you've come to Christ.
[time=1414] And now, this sanctification process is -- Jesus is the light, and now it's just you're kind
[time=1420] of journeying towards Jesus and the closer -- the more you walk with Him in that daily
[time=1426] process, that continual process, you're becoming formed or transformed into the likeness of Christ, okay?
[time=1433] And these lines here are -- I call them lines of conviction, I won't write it because last I tried to read anyway, so these are lines of conviction.
[time=1441] You could use the scriptures for that.
[time=1443] You could use a brother and sister in Christ.
[time=1446] And for what I'm supposed to be talking about, husbands, you are that line of conviction
[time=1452] with your wife.
[time=1455] You're that line of conviction and the church.
[time=1457] Men, we are the sentinels of the church.
[time=1459] We are to protect the doctrine of the church.
[time=1461] Well, we have elders, they stand here and say, no, no, no, that's not true.
[time=1465] We can't go that direction.
[time=1467] And the same is true with your wife, right?
[time=1470] You are married.
[time=1472] God gave you that wife.
[time=1473] She is yours.
[time=1476] Protect her.
[time=1477] Lead her.
[time=1478] Love her.
[time=1479] That -- it sounds big, but really, here's a real practical way to do that.
[time=1484] Next time you're together, you're hanging out, you're sitting there, whatever, ask her, how are you doing spiritually?
[time=1491] And then close your mouth.
[time=1493] She'll do the rest, right?
[time=1495] Ask her, hey, how are you -- what is God teaching you?
[time=1499] What are you learning?
[time=1500] How am I doing at leading?
[time=1501] And be ready to receive some of that.
[time=1503] You might not be doing so great, but would you start, right?
[time=1508] Would you start kind of joining linking arms together?
[time=1511] God's doing the thing, right?
[time=1513] God's doing the sanctification.
[time=1514] We just need to be ready to take it.
[time=1516] Yeah, but Jesse, what if she, you know, has a question that I can't answer?
[time=1521] That's -- yeah.
[time=1522] I get that all the time, send them to Jesse.
[time=1524] Send them to Jesse.
[time=1525] Put my email on the screen.
[time=1527] No.
[time=1528] Yeah, that's going to happen.
[time=1529] You don't have to have all the answers.
[time=1530] You really don't, but maybe that would be a great place for you to engage with her and find out together, right?
[time=1536] Go to the pastor.
[time=1537] Go to an elder that you respect.
[time=1539] Somebody you can go, hey, we're not sure about this.
[time=1541] How do we do this?
[time=1542] We have some marriage small groups, I believe, started.
[time=1544] We have things we want to help you with, but this is kind of the process that we all go through.
[time=1549] Single guys.
[time=1550] You're single in here.
[time=1551] You are still in this process because in a way you get to protect or destroy young ladies.
[time=1560] By the way you talk with them, by the way you text them, by the way you treat them, by the way you quote unquote date them, right?
[time=1566] You still have a responsibility just because you're not married doesn't mean you don't have a respect.
[time=1571] You are a man.
[time=1573] And God has given you some responsibility as a man to lead well, to protect well, to
[time=1579] stand up against guys who aren't doing that until I'm, no, you're not going to do that to that young lady.
[time=1585] I'm not going to let you, right?
[time=1587] No, no, no.
[time=1588] That's my wife.
[time=1589] One of the greatest things with my kids that I learned, I did this, it was a couple months ago.
[time=1595] The girls were doing something, I can't remember what it was, don't tell them I said this, but they just really made Amy upset, my wife Amy.
[time=1602] And so I went upstairs, I didn't yell, I just said, girls, so that's my wife.
[time=1607] And you made her upset, and that's not okay.
[time=1610] And then I just walked out of the room.
[time=1612] They drew a card, they had balloons, we're so sorry, Mom, we're so sorry.
[time=1617] You know, like it just were, I didn't yell, I just said, that's my wife.
[time=1621] And that's your wife.
[time=1622] God has given you, you're responsible to lead her spiritually.
[time=1625] And this process, one last thing, with this process, when you've seen somebody who's walked with Christ for many, many years, I think of Keith Moore, right?
[time=1634] Is he perfect?
[time=1635] No.
[time=1636] Has he made mistakes?
[time=1637] Absolutely.
[time=1638] But there's just something about when you hear him pray, or when you hear him talk about the scriptures or life, he just seems like he's real close to that Jesus piece, right?
[time=1647] He's just kind of, been kind of sanctified, he's longed through that process of being washed and purified and taught, and it's a hard process, it's not easy.
[time=1656] But God's there.
[time=1657] I think of, I'll say this, with Moses, you know what I think about Moses?
[time=1662] Moses is a guy back in the day, and when I think of Moses, I think a really long beard, super long, like Charlton Heston, you know, he was a great Moses.
[time=1671] And God comes in, I need you to go talk to Pharaoh, right?
[time=1673] I need you to go talk to Pharaoh, and Moses is like, nope.
[time=1676] And then makes all the excuses, like, I don't have this, I can't really talk well.
[time=1680] And God just looks at him and says, here's some grace, now you can do anything.
[time=1684] You see, grace qualifies us to do anything for God.
[time=1689] If you're sitting out there, guys, and you're like, I can't ask my wife those questions, yeah, you can, because Jesus is right there with you, grace is right there with you.
[time=1697] See, when we get lost in seeing ourselves only as ourselves, by ourselves, and that with Jesus right next to us, we've missed the mark, we got a little confused.
[time=1708] But if you see yourself with Jesus, anything's possible.
[time=1712] Right belief, wrong belief.
[time=1713] There you go.
[time=1714] The one who began the good work in you will be faithful to complete it.
[time=1718] Philippians 1, that's so good, that's so good.
[time=1721] My prop, my prop.
[time=1722] And I like this phrase, somebody taught me this phrase too, when you're talking with your wife and asking those questions, eagerly anticipate the work of the Spirit.
[time=1730] He's there, he's active, he's moving, he's doing and accomplishing more than we could ever imagine.
[time=1735] That's good.
[time=1736] Very good.
[time=1737] Thanks, Jesse.
[time=1738] Well done.
[time=1739] What about this idea of real men, God's call on us to be participating with him in the
[time=1745] sanctifying of our families.
[time=1748] I was talking to my wife, Jody, last night, and I said, "Honey, I'm just not very good
[time=1754] at any of this." Just not really, and she goes, "It's okay.
[time=1758] I know that you're not all, have it all together." And I can't tell you how liberating that was for her to tell me that I don't expect you to be perfect.
[time=1767] Guys, we're in the boat with you, we're rowing the, we got our hands on the oars too.
[time=1772] We're going to have it all figured out, and there's no sense at all this morning for me or for many of us that we have all the answers.
[time=1779] We're just trying to help, trying to come alongside you and be a help.
[time=1783] Ephesians 6-4 says, "Fathers, don't provoke your kids to anger."
[time=1789] I think the NIV says, "Don't exasperate your kids." And how do I do that?
[time=1794] In other words, how do I not do that?
[time=1796] How do I avoid provoking anger in my kids?
[time=1801] I bet, if you're anything like me and I think you are, that you probably feel most angry
[time=1807] at the things that you see in your kids when you see yourself in them.
[time=1811] I'm just like that.
[time=1812] I have this really bad reaction to you, "Oh my goodness, they're just like me." Or she'd be more like their mother, but anyway, Deuteronomy 6 comes to mind, if you have your
[time=1821] Bibles, if you go to Deuteronomy 6 with me, these are verses that are prayed by the Jewish
[time=1828] people every morning.
[time=1830] It's called the Shema begins in Deuteronomy 6 and verse 4, and it reads like this, "Here,
[time=1837] O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one, you shall love the Lord your God with all
[time=1843] your heart, with all your soul, with all your might, and these words I command you today shall be on your heart.
[time=1850] You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your
[time=1857] house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise." There is this expectation out there in the Scriptures that men will be about what God
[time=1869] has said.
[time=1870] Look down at verse 20, thank you, Josh Rang, 6 verse 20, "When your son asks you in time
[time=1876] to come, what's the meaning of the testimonies and the statutes and the rules the Lord your God has commanded you, then you shall say to your son, we were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt,
[time=1888] the Lord blest out of Egypt with a mighty hand." The kids want to hear your stories, and that story that Jesse drew in that piece of paper, they want to hear that story, they need to hear that story, if it's true in your life of how God brought you out of darkness into light, I was 19 when that happened for me, I was dead in my trespasses in my sins, and God made me alive in Christ Jesus.
[time=1912] My kids need to hear that from me about what God did.
[time=1916] I was a slave to sin, and now I'm alive.
[time=1918] We're slaves no longer, Psalm 78 says the very, very same thing, but tell these great and marvelous deeds that God has done.
[time=1927] Talk about them to your kids, which implies that you know them in the first place.
[time=1931] So there is this responsibility, friends, that we're mindful of what God's done and what God said, and that works best, men in community.
[time=1940] You don't have to have it all together.
[time=1942] Faith is a community project.
[time=1945] God's at work in you, and eventually, of course, we believe that, but God is at work in you, the sanctification process, Kelly will talk a lot more about this in a minute, but this process is ongoing as we're here together.
[time=1956] Men, there are four things I would share and pass on to you, just, these are not rules, these are laws, these are just suggestions, they're trying to help, suggestions for you as to how you can avoid provoking your kids, how you can avoid exasperating them, and here
[time=1971] they are.
[time=1972] The most important thing is what Jesse just said, love their mom.
[time=1976] Your kids should never wonder where your priorities lie, and Jesse's story is a perfect illustration of that.
[time=1983] And your kids know, men, that you love their mom, more than anyone else in the world, that makes a huge difference.
[time=1990] That gives them a sense of place and belonging they would never otherwise have.
[time=1994] The second thing I would say, I just want- I'll just step in real quick on the first thing, is some people would say, you should never tell your kids that.
[time=2002] I tell my two daughters, Hollis and Gillian, there's no one that I love more on this earth than your mom.
[time=2009] And then I tell them, secondly, it's you guys.
[time=2011] First and foremost, it's your mom.
[time=2014] And I know a lot of people would say, you can't say that to them, but I think it's one of the best things I can do for them.
[time=2019] So sorry.
[time=2020] It does.
[time=2021] I would also say, one of the things when I was at Fall Blast one week, and I went around and just asked some of the gals who were there, I said, what's one thing you'd like to see more?
[time=2032] All of them said they feared their mom and dad splitting up.
[time=2037] And these are good homes, good families.
[time=2040] But so, yes, loving them, but also saying, hey, you know, just maybe not all the time, but maybe somewhere in there, maybe because there's fights happening, hey, let's warm air, right?
[time=2048] It's part of the thanks process.
[time=2049] So you know what?
[time=2050] I'm never going to leave your mother.
[time=2052] There's something, because they see it all over the place, right?
[time=2055] That can just go a long way in loving their mother, say, hey, I'm her, I'm with her.
[time=2060] I say this a lot.
[time=2061] Your mom drives me crazy, but I love her.
[time=2065] And if in your journey, you've already crossed that bridge, and you've got a second, you
[time=2072] know, spouse.
[time=2073] Understand God's grace is there for you in that as well.
[time=2076] Because nobody is a better father to your children than God.
[time=2082] And so take that too.
[time=2084] The second thing I would just encourage you is to praise obedience.
[time=2087] Some of you guys grew up in homes where there was no praise, because praise for a man means that you're weak, it was always the hammer dropping all the time.
[time=2095] There is a time to drop the hammer.
[time=2097] If your kids don't ever get disciplined, then the Bible says that they don't really know that you love them.
[time=2103] So there is a place for discipline and for correction.
[time=2105] There's also a place for praising them when things go right.
[time=2108] Again, there is a positive, and there is a negative side, the sanctification process.
[time=2112] Pruning stuff away doesn't belong there.
[time=2114] That's necessary.
[time=2115] But when they do it right, tell them they do it right.
[time=2117] Your kid should never be afraid of you in that sense.
[time=2120] Number three, say you're sorry.
[time=2123] Those are two very, very powerful work because you're going to mess up as a dad.
[time=2127] I have more than I can count, so I'm still living with a woman that's gracious to me.
[time=2133] Say you're sorry when you mess up with your kids, because you're going to.
[time=2137] Watch how they respond to you.
[time=2138] I thought my kids sorry often because I screw up a lot.
[time=2141] And when I watch their faces, I can just watch the tension just go away.
[time=2147] It's incredible.
[time=2148] The last thing I would say is this, this is an encouragement, not a rule, not a law, just an encouragement, is make family time a priority.
[time=2156] Put your phone away at the table, it's a small thing.
[time=2159] It makes a big difference, and I don't always do that as well as I should.
[time=2163] But when the people around you know that you're looking at them and you're listening to them, that makes a major, major difference.
[time=2169] These are four ways that I think you can get in the way or get out of the way of exasperation,
[time=2175] of making your kids angry, or provoking them.
[time=2178] The four of us are in ministry, and so there is this level of expectation on them through us that we have to wrestle with by the grace of God, anything is possible.
[time=2187] Grace is this qualifier that you can do anything that God asks you to do.
[time=2191] He's never going to ask you guys to do something and then sit you off and say, well, good luck with all that.
[time=2196] He'll be with you wherever you are.
[time=2197] How does this very, very great in precious promise?
[time=2199] The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
[time=2202] [AMEN] Just a few minutes ago.
[time=2204] So put that in your pocket, guys.
[time=2206] Good.
[time=2207] Yeah.
[time=2208] Oh, yeah.
[time=2209] My picture.
[time=2210] Hey, I'll just say this.
[time=2211] If you wouldn't mind, I would encourage you to write this down.
[time=2213] Everybody just write down Judges chapter 2, verses 6 through 10.
[time=2221] And as it relates, guys, to the opportunity we have as men, to, as Steve just said, tell
[time=2228] the stories of God at work, to tell the stories of God's redeeming efforts, to make sure
[time=2234] our kids see and know about what God has done.
[time=2238] Think about this.
[time=2239] Joshua dies in verse 6 of Judges 2.
[time=2244] And all the days of the elders who survived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of
[time=2250] the Lord, which he had done for Israel, think of the amazing things, the people of Israel.
[time=2256] And these guys, Joshua and the elders, think of all that they saw and all that they watched
[time=2262] God do.
[time=2263] Then Joshua, the son of none, the servant of the Lord died at the age of 110, and they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath, Harris, in the hill country of
[time=2273] Ephraim, north of Mount Gash, watch.
[time=2278] All that generation also were gathered, Joshua's peers, to their fathers.
[time=2286] And their arose another generation after them.
[time=2290] This is their sons who did not know the Lord, nor yet even the work, the things which he
[time=2303] had done.
[time=2305] And they, that generation, crashed and burned.
[time=2311] They were clueless.
[time=2313] They had been given nothing.
[time=2315] Nothing had been deposited into them.
[time=2317] They hadn't been told the stories, the truths hadn't been invested deposited into their
[time=2324] hearts and lives.
[time=2325] And guys, we've got this great, great privilege to do that, and I hope we will do a better job of it.
[time=2331] Real men sanctify themselves, their wives, their kids, and those in their church.
[time=2338] I want you to just look at it this way, so a real God-honoring man, while he makes this
[time=2347] huge commitment to grow himself, his wife, and his kids toward holiness and toward Christ,
[time=2355] he also sees this place in the church family.
[time=2358] A real man sees where God has put him in the body of Christ.
[time=2363] You are, I am increasingly aware that God has given us time, talents, and treasure as
[time=2369] a man, designed by God to influence and lead.
[time=2372] And the real man raises his hand and jumps in to do ministry and service in the local
[time=2379] church.
[time=2380] Why?
[time=2381] You'll see this on the screen because it is the ministry, and we believe this here at Black Hawk, it is the ministry and service of the local church that God uses to sanctify
[time=2392] his people.
[time=2393] The ministry and service of the local church, no, that's not the building.
[time=2398] Obviously, that's us, and it's your willingness and mind to engage in ministry.
[time=2404] Yes, there's things to do on your own with you, guys.
[time=2407] Yes, there are things to do in the relationship that God has given you with your wife and your families.
[time=2413] Yes, do those things.
[time=2414] But this right here, this body of Christ, this fellowship, this family that we're a part
[time=2420] of, God says it is absolutely important that you would make an investment, that you would
[time=2426] give yourself to the sanctifying work that's going on in this place.
[time=2431] Look at Ephesians 4, you can read it in your Bible if you've got a pad or an iPhone and
[time=2437] you have a way of flipping translations, go to the NLT.
[time=2441] I love the NLT, it's our Bibles at heart, kids' Bibles at home somehow got to be NLTs and
[time=2448] the more we've read them, the more I love this translation.
[time=2452] Listen to what it says about the ministry, responsibility, and opportunity God has given you men, all of us in the family of God.
[time=2460] It says in Ephesians 4, 11, "Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church, to the
[time=2466] apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers." That's us.
[time=2472] Their responsibility, our responsibility as a teaching team is to equip, it says, to equip God's people to do His work and build up the church, the body of Christ.
[time=2483] It goes on in verse 13 to say this, "This will continue until we all come to such unity
[time=2491] in our faith and knowledge of God's Son, that we will be mature in the Lord." That's why at Blackhawk we say we're about completing people.
[time=2500] We mean that.
[time=2501] We want you to grow in sanctification toward completeness.
[time=2506] We will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ.
[time=2513] This is what we're after.
[time=2514] This is what we get to help with.
[time=2516] Then we will no longer be immature like children.
[time=2519] We won't be tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching.
[time=2524] We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies, so clever they sound
[time=2530] like the truth in verse 15.
[time=2534] He says, "Instead, men, you have the chance, we have the privilege of doing this.
[time=2541] We will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ who is
[time=2547] the head of His body, the church," and then I want you to see some things here in 16.
[time=2553] Love what it says.
[time=2554] He makes, God makes the whole body, every one of us.
[time=2558] He makes the whole body fit together perfectly.
[time=2561] That's how He designed it.
[time=2562] We were designed to perfectly fit together.
[time=2567] As in this happens, this perfect fit comes about as each part does its own special work.
[time=2576] It helps the other parts grow so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full
[time=2582] of love.
[time=2583] Two things.
[time=2584] This doesn't happen.
[time=2586] It gets all sideways.
[time=2588] It gets messy.
[time=2589] It's less than what God designed, guys, if you don't realize that you have a special part.
[time=2596] There is a special work for you to do, men.
[time=2601] And I look around the whole room because it's so important that every one of you men who knows the Lord, every one of you who has fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ, see there's no passing of the ministry, Bach, you can't look at me, you can't look at leadership.
[time=2619] You have to understand that God has designed you as a man to make a sleeves rolled up faithful
[time=2626] diligent contribution to the ministry of the body of Christ.
[time=2631] And I want to just make sure that every one of you men in the room this morning, those of you watching online, I want you to hear me.
[time=2639] You have a special part in this great endeavor.
[time=2644] I'm thankful for mine.
[time=2646] Mine's no more special than yours because unless you do your part, it doesn't perfectly
[time=2653] fit together.
[time=2655] I want you to, secondly, I want each man to understand that you should be helping others grow, helping other parts grow, as it said there in verse 16.
[time=2664] You are a grower of people.
[time=2667] I want you to think about your identity as it's described in verse 16.
[time=2672] You are a grower of people.
[time=2675] You can do that.
[time=2676] You can help six-year-olds grow.
[time=2680] Go down the hall, sign up, roll up your sleeves and teach them and show them the love of God.
[time=2685] You can help kids grow.
[time=2687] Many of you men could do that.
[time=2689] You can help the body grow by offering your unique contribution during the week in some volunteer capacity, maybe even in our office.
[time=2697] You can help this thing perfectly fit together, guys, by serving in the parking lot during
[time=2703] services.
[time=2704] There's all kinds of things you can do in helping lead small groups and helping with students who need mentors.
[time=2710] There's plenty for you to do.
[time=2713] Josh and myself, Webby and Jesse, we would be more than happy to help you be a man who
[time=2719] sanctifies the local church by your willingness to roll up your sleeves and make that unique contribution that only you can make.
[time=2729] It may not be leading in a small group.
[time=2731] It may be the first follower in a small group.
[time=2736] Sometimes when you're out by yourself, it takes that first follower to come for other
[time=2742] followers to participate as well, and so maybe that's yours as well.
[time=2746] It's just a symbol that we've used in the past, and I'm going to just put it here on the table with the mirror and with the wedding bouquet and the family picture.
[time=2755] We would love for men to more and more see themselves in the local church context as
[time=2762] those who are willing to, with a white towel, step into the needs of this place and give
[time=2770] of your time and your talent and your unique capacity.
[time=2773] I hope that we're teaching our young men to be servants, to serving, go above and beyond
[time=2780] past games and past immediate pleasure to the bigger picture of serving and helping meet
[time=2788] the needs of those in the body of Christ, so there you go, the white towel for the man who helped sanctify the church.
[time=2795] I wanted to also say, everybody real quick as we close, I wanted to also say that there's a resource available for you week after week in the digging deeper insert that we put together, called around the table.
[time=2804] It's all kinds of ideas from children's ministry as to how you guys can help lead your families.
[time=2810] The things you can do, there's activities in there, there's things to do, things not to do, so I encourage you with that this morning.
[time=2818] So as we close, share with you a few thoughts, probably too many, but I only get so many
[time=2825] options up here, so many times up here, so I've got to get it out.
[time=2829] True.
[time=2830] Yeah, true.
[time=2831] The ranks have five Hs in our family, hard work, honesty, humility, heart pretties, we'll
[time=2839] stop on that one.
[time=2840] Heart pretties, again, you may change that if you want, but heart pretties just simply means these guys gave me a hard time last time.
[time=2845] It's fantastic.
[time=2846] And heart pretties just means you're more concerned about what's going on in your inside than the outside.
[time=2850] Okay, I've got two girls and that just seemed very, very fitting.
[time=2853] And then help.
[time=2854] It's because you have girls.
[time=2855] If you had guys.
[time=2856] We couldn't call it heart pretties.
[time=2857] We have heart pretties.
[time=2858] You probably should call it heart pretties.
[time=2859] So it's okay.
[time=2860] Honk something.
[time=2861] I don't know.
[time=2862] You're good.
[time=2863] Okay.
[time=2864] It makes sense.
[time=2865] All right, so the one I just keep going back that I think is just the most important of all those, they're all important, but it's humility.
[time=2870] And I want to encourage you men, first Peter five, James four, they both say the same things,
[time=2876] they quote the Old Testament says that God is opposed to the proud, but he gives grace to the humble.
[time=2883] So you have the opportunity to position yourself to position the relationship that you have
[time=2889] with your spouse, with your kids in such a way as to be as open as possible to receive
[time=2896] as much grace from God as possible.
[time=2899] And the way that you do that is by pursuing humility.
[time=2903] If you want to cut off God's grace, you can be proud.
[time=2908] But to pursue humility, which again, just comes back to just being open to receive help,
[time=2914] being quick to receive instruction, being quick to receive, you know, correction sometimes.
[time=2921] But just dive into humility and you will see God's grace just pour in.
[time=2927] And so one of the things that I do on a monthly basis, I have a one hour phone conversation with the gentleman that's older than me, and I just every, every month, we have a phone conversation say, hey, what am I missing?
[time=2939] Where am I, where do I need to just, you know, make some changes?
[time=2944] We talk about my marriage, we talk about my kids, we talk about, you know, all those type of things.
[time=2949] And so I just encourage you to pursue humility and get help.
[time=2953] If it's, you know, somebody older, some but one of your peers, one of us, anybody, but pursue humility so that God's grace will just flow into your family.
[time=2962] The other thing that I will say is this, I'm convinced that, you know, I meet with, with men of all ages and significance is, is becoming such a big deal to us men.
[time=2972] There's this search for significance, a desire to be more and more significant, whether that's
[time=2978] a more significant role or some other type of significance.
[time=2982] And I understand again that it's good to be excellent in what you do.
[time=2985] So I'm, I'm not saying that, but understand this, there's nothing more significant for
[time=2993] you to do than to invest in your family.
[time=2999] There's nothing more significant.
[time=3000] I love the specificity of scripture in that it says, husband, husbands love your wives
[time=3006] in Ephesians 5.
[time=3007] You know who your wife is.
[time=3009] There's only one.
[time=3010] You don't have to guess, God, what do you want me to do?
[time=3012] How, how can I be significant?
[time=3014] He's told you, you know who it is and so invest.
[time=3020] He's specific in that he's told told you to love and to lead and to train up your children.
[time=3025] You know who they are.
[time=3026] You don't have to guess and so invest in your children.
[time=3029] And then after that, there's a general call to be involved in the church to love your neighbor, but it's not nearly as specific is it?
[time=3037] It could be multiple ways that you serve in the church or multiple people who are your neighbor.
[time=3042] You just want to come back to understand that there is great significance in the conversations you have around the table.
[time=3049] There's great significance in the fact that you can seek forgiveness from your children.
[time=3054] There's great significance in rolling around on the ground and playing with your young children.
[time=3060] It is more significant than you think.
[time=3063] One final example is just that brings this home is it's a great example of Jonathan Edwards,
[time=3069] a Puritan preacher from the 1700s.
[time=3072] Jonathan and his wife Sarah left a great godly legacy for his 11 children.
[time=3077] At the turn of the 20th century, American educator and pastor A.E.
[time=3081] Winship decided to trace out the descendants of Jonathan Edwards almost 150 years after
[time=3087] his death.
[time=3089] His findings are astounding, especially when compared to a man whose name was Max Jukes.
[time=3096] Jukes' legacy came to the forefront when the family trees of 42 different men in the New York prison system traced back to him.
[time=3104] So understand, here's what Jonathan Edwards' godly legacy includes.
[time=3108] One U.S. vice president, three U.S. senators, three governors, three mayors, 13 college
[time=3114] presidents, 30 judges, 65 professors, 80 public office holders, 100 lawyers and 100 missionaries
[time=3122] came from Jonathan and Sarah Edwards.
[time=3125] Max Jukes' descendants include seven murderers, 60 thieves, 50 women of debauchery, 130 other
[time=3131] convicts, 310 poppers, 400 who are physically wrecked by indulgent living.
[time=3141] It's important, it's significant, just the small hours and the small time that you invest
[time=3148] in your own relationship with Christ, in the way that you interact with your spouse, in the way that you interact with your kids.
[time=3157] As the band comes back up, I'm going to pray for us.
[time=3163] I hope you enjoyed, this was my first time at Team Teach and I really enjoyed it.
[time=3168] Romans 832 is the phrase I want to leave you with last.
[time=3173] Romans 832, "He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all, how will he
[time=3180] not also freely give us all things in him?" In other words, if God went to such an extent, to slay his son to save us, how will he not
[time=3191] do whatever it takes to sanctify us and to be our greatest ally?
[time=3196] And so understand, man, that when you're in the trenches and when you're not understanding what to do or how to do it or how to get it done, God is there to support you.
[time=3205] He strongly supports you.
[time=3207] He's on your side, He's for you.
[time=3210] Let's pray.
[time=3211] God, thank you so much.
[time=3215] Thank you so much that in your great humility, you came to earth and you lived a life of
[time=3224] perfection and you went to Calvary and even though you didn't deserve any of it, you
[time=3233] took the full wrath of your Father, the wrath that I deserved, that every human deserves
[time=3240] because of our sin and in that not only did you take the wrath that I deserved, but you
[time=3248] gave me the perfect life that you lived.
[time=3252] Well, thank you for those wonderful promises that I will be in heaven forever that is guaranteed
[time=3259] and secured by the work of Christ, that your presence is real, that your provisions are
[time=3266] true, your power is available on a daily basis.
[time=3272] God I pray that you'd encourage us men.
[time=3275] Lord help us to know that we don't have to do it perfectly.
[time=3279] Help us to know that you strongly support us.
[time=3283] And then Lord would you sanctify us, would you sanctify our wives and sanctify our children
[time=3289] for your glory and for your honor, would you sanctify our church for your glory and for
[time=3298] your honor?
[time=3299] In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[time=3319] God is able, God is able, He will never fail, He is all my God.
[time=3336] Pray than all we see, Pray than all we ask, He has done great things, lifted up, He defeated
[time=3352] us and gave, raised to life, our God is able, in His name, we overcome, for the Lord, our
[time=3370] God is able.
[time=3378] God is with us, God is with us, God is on our side, He will make the way, far above
[time=3397] all we know, far above all we know, He has done great things, lifted up, He has done
[time=3407] great things, lifted up, He defeated the grave, raised to life, our God is able, in His name,
[time=3424] He has done great things, lifted up, He has done great things, lifted up, He has done
[time=3446] great things, lifted up, He has done great things, lifted up, He has done great things,
[time=3490] He has done great things, lifted up, He has done great things, lifted up, He has done
[time=3518] great things, lifted up, He has done great things, lifted up, He has done great things,
