[time=303] From the darkest night to the brightest day,
[time=330] I can't see you in every single breath to my dying day.
[time=340] Father, you alone can't be as your own.
[time=344] You never let me go.
[time=353] In everything I will give you grace.
[time=361] All you are, I will give you grace.
[time=366] You're constant and faithful.
[time=370] You never change.
[time=373] You're constant and faithful.
[time=377] You never change.
[time=394] In the valley, in the valley low to the mountain high.
[time=402] You are by my side, every single step all along the way.
[time=412] Everywhere I go, you are in control.
[time=416] There's no one like you got.
[time=420] No one like you got everything.
[time=425] In everything I will give you grace.
[time=431] So all you are, I will bring you grace.
[time=437] You're constant and faithful.
[time=441] You never change.
[time=444] You're constant and faithful.

[time=550] You never change.
[time=577] The mountains fall.
[time=580] In the timbets what you are waiting for.
[time=586] The creation falls.
[time=594] Since my soul will soar on mercy.
[time=604] And I'll walk through the fire with my head near high.
[time=611] And my spirit will be revived in your story.
[time=618] And I'll look to the cross as my failure is lost in the light of the glorious grace.

[time=685] And I'll walk through the fire with my head near high.
[time=691] And my spirit will be revived in your story.
[time=698] And I'll look to the cross as my failure is lost in the light of the glorious grace.

[time=743] Rise and hope from the ashes, wherever you are.
[time=750] So we'll find refuge in the shadow of your wing.
[time=756] I love you forever and forever I'll sing.
[time=764] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[time=790] Let the ruins come to light in the beauty of your name.
[time=796] Rise and hope from the ashes, wherever you are.
[time=803] In the soul will find refuge in the shadow of your wing.
[time=810] I love you forever and forever I'll sing.
[time=816] Let the ruins come to light in the beauty of your name.
[time=823] Rise and hope from the ashes, wherever you are.
[time=830] And my soul will find refuge in the shadow of your wing.
[time=836] I love you forever and forever I'll sing.
[time=846] Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=854] It is so nice for us here at Black Hawk and the Bible Hour to know that each and every week
[time=860] there are literally thousands of you who tune in and you're getting encouraged.
[time=865] You're having a chance to have the Word of God do what only the Word of God can do.
[time=869] And that is encourage and challenge and instruct and envision you at a level that nothing else can.
[time=875] And so we counted a real privilege to be able to bring this each and every week to you were thankful for the broadcast, even more thankful for the Word of God and the guidance that it brings to each and every one of us.
[time=888] I can't wait for next week.
[time=890] We are working on a new teaching series that will begin on the 16th of the month and it's
[time=898] going to be about a four or five week series and we are going to for the first time in my years here at Black Hawk we're going to actually teach through and look at the book of Jonah.
[time=908] Obviously many of us have heard the story of the book of Jonah.
[time=912] Many of us have heard the great story of the great fish that comes and swallows Jonah as
[time=918] he flounders in the sea having been tossed overboard by the people on the crew of the ship that was about to go down.
[time=925] It's a story that oftentimes as I talk with people and as Jonah comes up or that story
[time=932] comes up a lot of people think it's a parable.
[time=936] A lot of people think that it was just sort of an illustration and I believe from years
[time=944] of study and I believe because of how the Bible communicates this story that it's as real
[time=951] as the day is long.
[time=953] It is a story that actually happened and Jonah was a real guy and he exhibited some attitudes
[time=960] and some thinking that I think are really important for us to look at.
[time=964] We're entitling the series "I Am Jonah" and the fact of the matter is that if any of you watching struggle with disobedience, if any of you watching struggle in the day to
[time=976] day of your life following God when he calls you to hard things, if there's anybody out
[time=984] there listening and you have trouble being kind or extending peace toward those who are
[time=992] ruthless or evil.
[time=994] Any of you struggle with any of these things then guess what?
[time=998] You are Jonah as well.
[time=1000] We're all Jonah to a degree.
[time=1002] He struggled with things and God taught him as God led him down this road and it's an incredible road filled with unbelievable drama and life transformation and I can't
[time=1013] wait for you to join us and be a part of this study with us.
[time=1017] We just finished five weeks on what it means to be a real man and if you missed those, I hope you'll go to the website and watch each of those weeks.
[time=1026] What a great time we've had together looking at God's design for manhood.
[time=1031] But I hope you'll be with us starting the 16th.
[time=1033] Come and be with us.
[time=1034] Join us live and in person for a study of Jonah that I think can change and alter the way
[time=1041] that I approach life and others.
[time=1043] Thanks so much for tuning in.
[time=1045] God bless you and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=1051] Well I'm really honored actually to introduce Karen back to you.
[time=1056] She has been an encouragement and role model for me.
[time=1060] I know that many of you can say the same.
[time=1062] She and her husband have been married for 44 years which as a young adult who's not
[time=1068] married yet such an encouragement to see many of you who have decided that you're committed
[time=1075] to your marriage hard and easy, poor and rich, healthy, sick.
[time=1080] You guys are willing to stick it out and this is the example that is for us.
[time=1084] They have called Black Hawk Home for about 25 years.
[time=1087] I know that God has been working upon her heart and that the Holy Spirit is going to
[time=1093] have her share some really important things for us to hear today.
[time=1095] So would you welcome Karen back to the stage with me.
[time=1098] (Applause)
[time=1105] Good morning.
[time=1106] So good.
[time=1107] Good to be here with you.
[time=1109] I start us in prayer.
[time=1112] Oh Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1115] What a privilege it is to be here and how humbling it is.
[time=1119] I confess to you in front of all these women that I failed so miserably at what I want
[time=1126] to teach about this morning and so grateful for your grace and your mercy that's new every day.
[time=1131] My pray father, your spirit would just follow for a shot on us.
[time=1135] Teach us this morning from your word.
[time=1138] May we keep our eyes on you.
[time=1140] The author and the finisher of our faith.
[time=1142] In Jesus name I pray.
[time=1144] [AMEN] I was to remind you where we've been in the last month.
[time=1151] Kelly's been teaching on love, loving wives and serving them and leading them and sanctifying
[time=1161] them and in that whole process been engaging with you over questions and reflections and
[time=1167] Bible verses over the week.
[time=1170] And I'm encouraged to just have the opportunity today to teach you about something that God
[time=1177] gives only to the women.
[time=1180] A command that he gives to women that he doesn't give to the men.
[time=1184] And the great marriage chapter of Ephesians 5 which really two-thirds of it is spoken
[time=1190] to the men.
[time=1193] It ends in verse 33 by saying nevertheless each individual among you also is to love his
[time=1202] own wife even as himself and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband.
[time=1208] Two different commands, husbands love your wives, wives respect your husbands.
[time=1217] And it tells me from that context that these aren't things we naturally do.
[time=1223] Women are pretty good lovers and I've noticed they're pretty lousy at respect.
[time=1230] We need help and men need help loving.
[time=1236] And it's this very command is showing respect that God uses to bring fruit in a marriage
[time=1244] and in a family.
[time=1245] So even though male and female he's created this equally we have different roles and some different commands and we're wired differently.
[time=1254] There is a book by Dr. Emerson Edgarge called Love and Respect and he addresses this thing
[time=1260] that we get trapped in.
[time=1262] He calls it the crazy cycle and when I work with women I often see this.
[time=1268] So I just don't respect him because he's not showing me love.
[time=1277] And the man would say well I can't love her because she's so disrespectful and they stay
[time=1284] in this cycle over and over again neither of them making movement.
[time=1288] I'm here to tell you today there is a way out.
[time=1294] Tim and I were 19 and 18 when we got married.
[time=1299] And in those first years of marriage he was going to college full time working full time
[time=1305] while I was just having babies.
[time=1307] We had four children in six and a half years and in that frame he graduated from college,
[time=1315] got a real job, we bought a house and we were off and running.
[time=1319] It was just a blur.
[time=1322] We never really stopped much to think about what we were doing or what we wanted.
[time=1325] We were just sort of parenting like our parents parented and entering into marriage like what we saw modeled.
[time=1333] But in that first decade of marriage a disillusionment crept in for both of us and a disappointment.
[time=1344] Even like a level of despair.
[time=1346] And I remember just feeling like there's not to be more than this.
[time=1352] It has to be better than this.
[time=1357] I think that disappointment was accentuated by listening to Dr. Dobbs in every day when he would talk about these wonderful men that would come home and communicate with their wives and have very encouraging conversations and bring flowers and I'm thinking what gives
[time=1373] here.
[time=1374] But I believed that our happiness was dependent on my husband.
[time=1386] And that if we were to be successful there was more that he needed to be doing.
[time=1391] And in that time frame God was so kind to just swoop me up from that place that I was in and put me in a group of older women.
[time=1402] They invited me to be a part of Bible study.
[time=1407] And in that frame of Bible study and being enmeshed in each other's lives I got to learn
[time=1416] from these older women.
[time=1419] It was the first time I ever really had God's Word opened up in just a practical way.
[time=1423] So the first study we did was Proverbs 31.
[time=1426] And then we jumped into the study, Lord change me by Evelyn Christensen, it's an oldie.
[time=1433] But I realized change could come through my response, through my behavior.
[time=1441] Change could come as I look to God's Word for my role in marriage.
[time=1449] Foundation like we're going to look at 1 Peter 1, 3 to 6.
[time=1452] You want to turn there in your Bibles, we'll go there.
[time=1456] If not you can follow up on the screen.
[time=1460] In the same way, and Peter's referring back to Jesus being the example.
[time=1466] In the same way you wives be submissive to your own husband so that even if any of them are disobedient to the Word they may be one without a word by the behavior of their wives.
[time=1478] As they observe your chaste and respectful behavior.
[time=1482] Your adornment must not be merely external, braiding the hair, wearing gold jewelry or
[time=1488] putting on dresses but let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable quality of a gentle and a quiet spirit which is precious in the sight of God.
[time=1498] For in this way in former times the holy women also who hoped in God used to adorn themselves
[time=1505] being submissive to their own husbands.
[time=1508] Just a Sarah Obey to Abraham calling him Lord and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear.
[time=1521] I read these verses and I thought I'm not any of them.
[time=1523] I'm not chaste.
[time=1524] I'm not respectful.
[time=1525] I'm not quiet.
[time=1526] I'm not gentle.
[time=1528] It's just not my personality.
[time=1531] But where I really stopped was on the word respectful.
[time=1536] I'd grown up in a family where there was lots of disrespect, lots of sarcasm, lots of humor
[time=1546] that was directed at people that really at their expense and I had no idea what respect
[time=1553] looked like.
[time=1555] So then I looked it up in the amplified version for Peter 3.2 which gives all the nuances
[time=1562] of the Greek that go into that word.
[time=1565] And this is how it reads, conduct yourselves together with your reverence for your husband.
[time=1572] That is you are to feel for him all that reverence includes, to respect, defer to, revere him.
[time=1581] And revere means to honor, esteem, appreciate, prize and in the human sense adore him.
[time=1590] And adore means to admire, praise, be devoted to deeply love and enjoy your husband.
[time=1601] There you have it.
[time=1602] I memorized it.
[time=1604] I wrote it out on an index card and I begged God to show me in practical ways what those
[time=1612] things would look like.
[time=1616] Your men respect is so important that if respect isn't shown, they don't feel loved.
[time=1625] It's equal.
[time=1626] When you ask them if your wife loves you, if she is not respecting him, it doesn't matter
[time=1632] that you keep the house clean.
[time=1633] It doesn't matter that you're raising his children.
[time=1637] It doesn't matter that you got your hair done yesterday.
[time=1642] If you are not showing respect, he does not feel loved.
[time=1649] In the time that we have left, I'd like to just dig deeper into some of these nuances.
[time=1654] And I'm going to use respect as an acronym so we can find out really what it means and
[time=1661] what it means to him.
[time=1663] The first word we're going to use is revere.
[time=1669] Feel for him all that reverence includes, the amplified said, to respect, defer to and
[time=1676] revere him.
[time=1679] We live in a society where there is little respect shown for leaders.
[time=1683] In fact, we're invited to criticize, give our opinion, weigh in on anything and anybody.
[time=1692] It doesn't matter whether we're in the church outside of the church.
[time=1695] We believe that respect is earned.
[time=1700] But the word God uses here in the Greek, that's not what that means.
[time=1705] The word is fobao.
[time=1708] It looks like phobio and we get the word phobia from that fear, fobao.
[time=1714] And it means to revere, be in awe of to reverence.
[time=1722] And God uses this word when he instructs us in authority systems.
[time=1728] It's used three times in Peter under the reign of Nero, persecuted Christians, lived in this
[time=1735] place and he's saying, fear, respect God, fear, respect the government, fear, respect
[time=1745] the king, slaves, fobao, your masters, wives, fobao, your husbands.
[time=1754] And in Romans, it's fear, respect the government, those rulers over you.
[time=1763] It's a hard attitude in response to someone in authority.
[time=1770] And Peter goes on to say in verse 6 that Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord.
[time=1776] It literally means that she responded to his position of authority, his headship.
[time=1784] He was master of their house.
[time=1787] When I was in Spain several years ago, we were in a Spanish church service.
[time=1792] And I noticed, it could only catch a few words, but I noticed as they were praying, the words
[time=1799] sing nor, Jesus Christo.
[time=1803] And I thought, oh my goodness, Jesus was addressed as Lord.
[time=1809] And every man in that culture addressed as sing nor, Lord, master, we've lost that sense
[time=1821] of authority, of headship.
[time=1824] We have a dear sister friend, mentor in our midst that passed away 12 days ago, Jan Van
[time=1831] Till.
[time=1832] And much was written about her life in Fort Wayne and in this church.
[time=1837] And Jan understood headship.
[time=1840] I want to read just a little bit from something that was written in the paper last week about her.
[time=1846] And Matt Anthony's in Fort Wayne for 35 years and worked mostly among men, said when she
[time=1853] announced her intention to retire, everyone started scrambling to put together a job description.
[time=1859] The title tournament coordinator doesn't have cover it.
[time=1862] She was part problem solver, panic reducer, ultimate organizer, and somehow had the patience
[time=1868] to beg people to help out without being obnoxious.
[time=1872] Eventually everyone owed her a favor.
[time=1876] It's amazing how one housewife could convince possibly the most influential group of men
[time=1882] in Fort Wayne to do what she suggested like it was their idea in the first place.
[time=1888] If it was her idea, then she'd be the one who'd make it actually work.
[time=1893] She had a servant's heart.
[time=1896] She understood headship.
[time=1900] Headship is not an invitation to dictatorship, to heavy handedness, to the oppression of
[time=1908] women, to ugly control.
[time=1912] The message is that Kelly has been preaching these last four weeks attest to that.
[time=1918] God never ask us as women to come underneath the authority of sin or abuse or addiction.
[time=1929] And if you're in a woman in that place and you're coming from that broken place or living
[time=1936] in that kind of a marriage, please, please ask for help.
[time=1941] We have resources here.
[time=1943] God has help for you.
[time=1948] This isn't a to-do list for people in that place.
[time=1956] God has lots of practical help for us as wives as we live in marriage.
[time=1960] But if you're in that place of pain, then please, please take advantage of the counsel
[time=1968] that we have here.
[time=1971] God gives men this honored place of headship.
[time=1975] And it permeates many of the places that we are in life.
[time=1980] It's not just about marriage, if you're young and hear, it's about respect for your teachers.
[time=1988] It's about respect for our pastor, those who lead in our community.
[time=1997] There are lots of places to practice respect before we ever get married or if we ever get
[time=2003] married, respect for your boss.
[time=2007] It's an attitude of the heart and we have a great place of influence when we look to
[time=2013] those people as heads.
[time=2015] Does your husband have a rightful place in your heart that you might biblically respond
[time=2022] to him?
[time=2024] The next word is esteem.
[time=2028] Shame him, honor him, appreciate him, prize him, adore him.
[time=2035] If you've ever read Song of Solomon, you'll capture the essence of this passionate love
[time=2046] this couple had for each other.
[time=2049] And I love these words.
[time=2051] These young women cries out, "My beloved is dazzling and ruddy, outstanding among 10,000.
[time=2059] He is wholly desirable.
[time=2061] This is my beloved, and this is my friend."
[time=2068] What man wouldn't want to be adored like that?
[time=2073] Men talk often about how they want to be viewed and how they want to be spoken of.
[time=2082] Speaking well of him in public and private is one of the greatest ways that you can respect
[time=2088] him.
[time=2090] Men often express how humiliating it is, how demeaning it is to be berated, criticized,
[time=2100] and by their wife, in public, in front of their children to be argued with.
[time=2105] It can be one of the lowest blows.
[time=2109] I've noticed as I stand at the greeting card counter, I love to send cards, and I've noticed
[time=2116] over the years that a section has grown very large.
[time=2121] And it's about berating and demeaning men.
[time=2126] Interviewed as morons, clueless, thoughtless, dumb.
[time=2135] For 295, you can buy one of those cards and put a stamp on it, have a good laugh and send it to your friends.
[time=2142] For some reason over these last decades that women have made such great strides, you have
[time=2149] education opportunities that we never had, job opportunities we never had, places of freedom
[time=2156] that we never had.
[time=2158] And yet it seems like in the process as women have gained these opportunities, men are just
[time=2165] being squished down, lower and lower.
[time=2170] There's nothing in Scripture that would say we would rise up and they would be squished
[time=2178] down.
[time=2180] When Jesus showed up on the scene with John the Baptist, the first thing John said is,
[time=2186] "He must increase and I must decrease." And as Jesus walked the earth, he said, "You want to be counted great?
[time=2197] You can learn to serve, lay down your life, think of others as more important than yourself."
[time=2204] So how do you speak to your husband?
[time=2209] Do you know that 70% of the message is our body language?
[time=2214] There's so many times that I am so proud of myself, I think I didn't say it.
[time=2221] I kept my mouth shut, but the face, the frown, this, the posture, it's disrespectful.
[time=2233] How do you address your husband in front of your children?
[time=2238] How do you speak to him about him with your girlfriends?
[time=2244] How is he viewed by your peers because of you?
[time=2248] Does he have great worth?
[time=2252] Do you prize and appreciate him?
[time=2258] The more often you find ways to speak highly of him, the more you'll believe it yourself.
[time=2265] It's contagious.
[time=2266] And you have an opportunity in your home, practice it, practice it in front of your children.
[time=2273] Daddy works hard to provide for us.
[time=2276] Look what daddy did for us today, that we can have this play date, brag on him in front
[time=2282] of your girlfriends.
[time=2285] My husband went out and cleaned the car this morning for me and got all the ice off and warmed it up so I could come in here, affirm him in front of your friends.
[time=2297] In front of his friends, they'll think he's the luckiest man alive.
[time=2302] And you know what, when you make much of the man that you're married to, what you're really
[time=2309] doing is making much of Jesus, much of the Jesus that you believe in.
[time=2318] S, submit the word that likes to bring the hairs on the back of women's necks bristling.
[time=2329] The verse that we have is verse Peter 3, 1 and Ephesians 5, 22, their companion verses.
[time=2335] And both of those verses say be submissive to your own husbands.
[time=2341] And the Amplified, it says, adapt yourselves to them.
[time=2345] Come underneath them.
[time=2347] And it tells me by what's said and what's not said, by being submissive to our own husbands,
[time=2355] that we might be more tempted as women to follow somebody else's leadership.
[time=2360] I might think my pastor is more spiritual.
[time=2364] I might think my boss is more reasonable.
[time=2368] I might think my teacher knows more.
[time=2372] I might think so-and-so's husband is much more understanding and sensitive.
[time=2380] What says, follow our own husbands?
[time=2387] And just as different as all of us are, every single man that's in that room in the gym,
[time=2393] it's different.
[time=2394] They're wired differently, they're going to lead differently.
[time=2397] And God says, come underneath their leadership.
[time=2403] And then we're told in 1 Peter over in verse 6 that we're going to be just like Sarah,
[time=2409] if we do what is right without being frightened by any fear.
[time=2414] And the way that we really can take this into ourselves is understand what Sarah had to
[time=2422] do.
[time=2424] She's elevated as following Abraham and calling him master and lord.
[time=2431] But Abraham came home one day and he said, pack up Sarah, we're leaving.
[time=2438] There we going.
[time=2440] I don't know, we're just going to go the place that God leads us.
[time=2445] You know Sarah wasn't privy to this private conversation that Abraham had with God.
[time=2451] Pack up, we're going somewhere.
[time=2455] So they packed up.
[time=2457] And in those days, it would have been alienation from every kind of comfort that you would
[time=2465] have ever known as a woman, you're leaving your family, you're leaving your friends.
[time=2471] There is no communication.
[time=2473] There is no texting and cell phone and Skype and internet.
[time=2480] All that communication cut off to follow your husband somewhere, who knows where.
[time=2488] And as they traversed the land, they came to Egypt.
[time=2494] And if you want to go back there with me, Genesis 12, 11 to 13, I want you to capture
[time=2500] a sense of what they were facing, what Sarah was facing.
[time=2507] As she was following Abraham, somewhere we don't know where.
[time=2512] 12, verse 11 we'll start with, I guess, it came about as they came near to Egypt that
[time=2520] he said to Sarah, his wife, see now I know you are a beautiful woman and when the Egyptians
[time=2527] see you, they'll say, this is his wife and they will kill me, but they'll let you live.
[time=2536] Please say that you're my sister so that it may go well with me because of you and that I may live on account of you.
[time=2545] Now Sarah really was his half sister, but it'd be like your husband saying to you, introducing
[time=2552] you as his friend or his little sister, Abe was scared for his life.
[time=2561] If they know you're my wife, then they're going to kill me.
[time=2565] So just tell them you're my sister.
[time=2569] What she did and what that meant was Pharaoh took her into his harem.
[time=2576] What it meant was he was offering her to him as a sexual faper, but God came to Pharaoh
[time=2592] and he protected Sarah, put diseases and plagues on all the people and Pharaoh let him go and
[time=2600] now you would have thought that'd be a big enough scare.
[time=2603] Something would have been learned from that, but no, over in Genesis 20, it's the same thing again.
[time=2608] They come to a bimilek, tell them you're my sister, and she gets put into a bimilek's
[time=2614] harem and God came to a bimilek in the middle of the night and said, a bimilek, you are a dead man if you touch her.
[time=2621] She is a married woman and he said, honestly, in the integrity of my heart, I did not know
[time=2628] and again, God protected them.
[time=2633] Why?
[time=2634] Because he had something so much greater than just their marriage going on.
[time=2639] I mean, he was making a nation.
[time=2642] He was growing Abraham to trust him.
[time=2647] He was teaching Abraham how to lead and he was teaching Sarah how to follow.
[time=2659] There's not a one of us that isn't going to be put in situations where it feels scary.
[time=2665] I don't know that I trust my husband's leadership right now.
[time=2668] I don't really want to do that, that doesn't feel best or good right now.
[time=2678] Husbands are sinful.
[time=2679] They're human.
[time=2680] They're frail.
[time=2681] They feel inadequate at times and they're growing and learning how to lead.
[time=2687] And the best way that they grow in that is for us to come underneath that rightful place.
[time=2695] God will not prosper a marriage where the wife is in control.
[time=2702] So what is it that would prompt control in your life?
[time=2705] What is it that would cause you to just dig your heels in and say, not go in there?
[time=2712] And again, I'm not talking about submitting to sin.
[time=2718] We can make a lot of things be sinned just because we have preferences and choices.
[time=2725] But where would you fear?
[time=2727] I see women fear over discipline that's given to the kids.
[time=2732] Parenting might look too harsh.
[time=2735] They fear over their husbands aren't seeking God for counsel.
[time=2740] So why would they want to follow that?
[time=2744] They fear that he's being too selfish when sometimes it's just the wife that's being
[time=2750] too selfish, but a husband can't lead if a wife is not willing to follow.
[time=2758] And if you're demonstrating an unwillingness to submit, then what you're really doing is showing disrespect to him and to God and modeling it to your children.
[time=2768] And it will ripple down and far and wide when control and disrespect is modeled.
[time=2776] So would you be willing to commit to being a better follower?
[time=2780] Study your husband's body language, respond graciously to his suggestions and not just in ways that seem reasonable and attractive to you, but in ways that he might be requesting.
[time=2793] According to him, instead of trying to control him, we'll leave room for God to have the last word.
[time=2803] The next letter, P, prefer.
[time=2808] Be devoted to one another in brotherly love, give preference to one another in honor.
[time=2813] Romans 12, Henn tells us, "Marriage invites us to be fully accessible to one another and
[time=2820] yet what I'm seeing is people living separate lives, friend of mine calls and married singles."
[time=2828] And there's this whole sense of even tit for tat.
[time=2832] You got to do that this week, so then I get to do this.
[time=2836] You had a boy's night, so I get a girl's night.
[time=2839] You got to go on a ski trip, I get to go shopping.
[time=2843] I had the kids all week, it's your turn to have the kids this weekend.
[time=2850] It isn't preferring.
[time=2852] The other thing I see is women preferring their children over their husband.
[time=2863] And men don't tend to do that.
[time=2866] Most situations, they prefer their wives, they want their wives.
[time=2870] But as moms, giving birth to those little ones, we get strongly attached and sometimes
[time=2877] it's just our hearts are drawn to those kids.
[time=2882] We feel torn between our husbands and our kids.
[time=2888] What kind of message are you sending to your husband about preferring him?
[time=2893] When he asks you to do something, "Honey, would you pick up the dry cleaning for me?
[time=2899] Would you call the insurance agent today?
[time=2900] Would you check to see if we've paid our bills?"
[time=2906] Or do you put that on the top of your list, or does it move down to the bottom of your
[time=2912] list?
[time=2913] You get around to it when you feel like it.
[time=2915] I have a young friend that years ago was telling me, "Three little children, how they taught
[time=2922] this preference in their home." When her husband came in at night, she said, "They would go to the bedroom while he changed his clothes." And none of the kids were allowed in the bedroom.
[time=2931] They closed the door and they'd be hanging on the door knob outside the door and kicking on the door, but they would go in there for 10 minutes while he changed, and just connect
[time=2940] over their day.
[time=2941] How'd your day go?
[time=2943] Give each other a hug, go back out and face the troops.
[time=2947] But it was such a sweet way of preferring each other.
[time=2953] So how might you show preference to your husband?
[time=2955] A date night, a weekend away, time for sexual intimacy, a willingness to engage in his
[time=2964] hobbies, work alongside of him?
[time=2968] Would you be willing this week to say yes to something that he would ask of you and
[time=2974] know to something else that might even be more appealing to you?
[time=2980] That's respect.
[time=2983] E, encourage.
[time=2987] Hebrews 3.13 says, "encourage one another day after day."
[time=2994] Goes on to say, "As long as it's still today, unless you are hardened by the deceitfulness of sin." And there is a sense in this verse that encouragement isn't just good for that other person.
[time=3007] It's good for my own heart.
[time=3009] When I give encouraging words, it grows my heart as well.
[time=3015] And I'll ask women, "Why wouldn't you give him a good word?" Well, he's just kind of arrogant.
[time=3022] He already thinks very highly of himself, and he'll just think more highly of himself.
[time=3026] Or, well, I mean, he did this and this and this, and there's quite a bit of unforgiveness there, and she's just not going to say a nice word.
[time=3036] Or I'm just not sure he deserves it.
[time=3040] And yet the beauty of this command is that when I give good words, I'm talking about
[time=3048] flattery, but when I give a good word, it grows my heart, and my heart stays tender
[time=3056] toward this man in my life.
[time=3059] Encouragement is not constantly reminding, forever asking, nagging, being helpful.
[time=3067] Men will often say they feel like their wife is trying to be their mother.
[time=3074] They didn't marry a mother, and they feel like they've been treated as a child.
[time=3080] They've been created to be the protector and the provider, and your quiet presence, and your loosening ear, and your encouraging words will go far.
[time=3093] Last two letters I put together, cultivate trust.
[time=3100] Solomon wrote, "An excellent wife who can find for her worth is far above jewels.
[time=3106] The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain.
[time=3111] She does him good and not evil all the days of her life." Peter says we have the potential of winning even a disobedient husband by our behavior.
[time=3125] The Proverbs woman was called excellent because she trusted God more than any of the circumstances
[time=3131] she was in, and for that she was publicly praised in the gates.
[time=3136] You want to get out of the crazy cycle and practice the rewarded cycle.
[time=3146] It's not about what he does or doesn't do, it's not about who he is, it's about what God's calling you to be.
[time=3153] And just as soon as you confess, "I can't God jumps in with, I can.
[time=3160] I can through you, through Jesus Christ, that model of respect, through the power of his
[time=3168] spirit that lives in us, through the power of his word that instructs us."
[time=3179] I was in Denver last week with our granddaughters and we were making Valentine cookies a little
[time=3185] early, and they just love baking and throwing the ingredients in and cutting out those
[time=3196] Valentine cookies, rolling them out, punching them out everywhere, flour everywhere, but the favorite part is frosting with sprinkles.
[time=3207] And it didn't matter how many times I said to them, "Now after you spread the frosting
[time=3215] on the cookie, put the knife back in the dish." Nope, slathered all that frosting on, stuck the knife in their mouth, and then put it back
[time=3228] in the dish.
[time=3230] And then the sprinkles, they were those round little sprinkles that rolled off the top of
[time=3236] the frosting, off the top of the cookie, onto the table, onto the floor, down into the floor
[time=3242] cracks. I'm sure my daughter-in-law will find sprinkles for months and months to come.
[time=3249] But I think of that picture of those three little girls delighting in that process, and
[time=3258] they just couldn't get enough of that sweetness.
[time=3262] Look, look, look. And you know, that's how it is when we infuse our marriages with respect,
[time=3274] with reverence and esteem and submission, preference, encouragement. It cultivates trust
[time=3288] with our husbands. And we spread a fragrance, a sweetness with sprinkles on top that go
[time=3297] beyond even our marriage, beyond that relationship that we have with him. And it ripples down
[time=3304] to our children, and it ripples out to our friends, to people we come in contact with.
[time=3313] Connect is far reaching. So how do you do it? Here we are in this place, and we're all
[time=3322] coming from different places, married a few years, married a lot of years, not married at all, single and wondering what it's going to look like for us. Well, I just want to
[time=3333] say to you, certainly not alone. I imagine your journey will be similar to mine and
[time=3339] yet very different. But number one, invite help. Sit with the Holy Spirit and ask Him
[time=3348] to show you. Maybe He's already stirring your heart today, where you have not practiced respect toward your husband or toward your leaders, toward your parents. Ask Him for
[time=3361] the humility. To go to your husband and ask Him, look to an older woman that would maybe
[time=3369] walk and do life with you. To immerse yourself in God's word. Spend time studying His word
[time=3379] alone and with other women. Memorize it. When you gird up your mind with His truth, you
[time=3386] will start to think His thoughts. And you won't be reacting on feelings, but you'll
[time=3393] allow truth to dictate how you respond. Three, obey God. Every opportunity you get, the
[time=3403] Holy Spirit is convicting you. Every opportunity you get. Practice it. Practice obeying God.
[time=3411] Just asking for forgiveness. Practice confessing sin. It's a great place to be. It'll transform
[time=3418] you and it'll transform your marriage. Four, spend time with couples who love Jesus. Find
[time=3426] other people that have done life a little bit longer than you. Maybe it's in a life group.
[time=3436] Maybe you're going to do a servant event together. Maybe it's a night out to dinner. But find other couples. And six, is it six? Pray, pray, pray, pray. Pray together. Pray alone. God
[time=3452] delights in His children who seek Him. He longs to give us His good gifts. He wants to display
[time=3458] Himself in your marriage and He can do the impossible. Janice is going to come up and
[time=3465] close us today with a song. It's a prayer for all of us. As we sit here and contemplate
[time=3472] what we just heard from the Word of God and how we may go out here from this place. Thanks, Janice.
[time=3478] Change my heart, oh God. Make it ever true. Change my heart, oh God. Make me be like you.
[time=3494] Be like you. You are the potter. I am the clay.
[time=3523] Make me and make me. This is what I pray. Change my heart, oh God.
