[time=0] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=34] I'm going to see my standard race, I stand, I'm amazed in the presence of Jesus, the Nazarene,
[time=47] and wonder how he could love me.
[time=65] I stand, I'm amazed in the presence of Jesus, the Nazarene, and wonder how he could love me.
[time=84] I stand, I'm amazed in the presence of Jesus, the Nazarene.
[time=89] I stand, I'm amazed in the presence of Jesus, the Nazarene, and wonder how he could love me.
[time=296] [MUSIC]
[time=318] From the darkest night to the brightest day, I can't see you in there every single breath to my dying day.
[time=333] Father, you alone can't be as your own. You never let me go. You never let me go.
[time=346] You never let me go. You never let me go. You never let me go. You never let me go.
[time=363] You never change when constant unfaithful, you never change.
[time=374] [MUSIC]
[time=387] From the valley to the mountain high, you are by my side, every single step all along the way.
[time=404] Everywhere I go, you are in control, there's no one like you got.
[time=412] No one like you got everything, in everything I was giving grace.
[time=425] For all you are, I could bring you grace.
[time=430] Your constant unfaithful, you never change.
[time=445] [MUSIC]
[time=461] Through our God, God of all, we will sing forever.
[time=519] Everything I will give you grace.
[time=526] For all you are, I could bring you grace.
[time=531] Your constant unfaithful, you never change.
[time=546] [MUSIC]
[time=571] Through our God, God of all, we will sing forever.
[time=611] I look to the cross as my failure is lost in the light of the glorious grace.
[time=623] That the ruins come to light in the beauty of your name.
[time=630] Rise it up from the ashes, wherever you are.
[time=637] In the soul we'll find refuge in the shadow of your wing.
[time=644] I love you forever, and forever I'll sing.
[time=652] In the world things and still my hope will lead to your heart.
[time=665] When my courage ends, then my heart finds faith in your breath.
[time=678] When I walk through the fire with my hand, then I, in my spirit, be revived in your glory.
[time=691] And I look to the cross as my failure is lost in the light of the glorious grace.
[time=703] That the ruins come to light in the beauty of your name.
[time=710] Rise it up from the ashes, wherever you are.
[time=716] In the soul we'll find refuge in the shadow of your wing.
[time=723] I love you forever, and forever I'll sing.
[time=729] That the ruins come to light in the beauty of your name.
[time=736] Rise it up from the ashes, wherever you are.
[time=743] In the soul we'll find refuge in the shadow of your wing.
[time=749] I love you forever, and forever I'll sing.
[time=757] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[time=783] In the soul we'll find refuge in the shadow of your wing.
[time=790] I love you forever, and forever I'll sing.
[time=797] That the ruins come to light in the shadow of your wing.
[time=803] I love you forever, and forever I'll sing.
[time=810] That the ruins come to light in the beauty of your name.
[time=816] Rise it up from the ashes, wherever you are.
[time=823] In the soul we'll find refuge in the shadow of your wings.
[time=830] I love you forever, and forever I'll sing.
[time=843] Well hello again everybody.
[time=844] Welcome to the broadcast, and welcome to what is kind of a special, unique insert that we're going to tape here.
[time=851] Usually these are just a couple of minutes, but today I've got my good friend Steve Webster.
[time=855] Hey, Webby.
[time=856] Good afternoon.
[time=857] Thank you, and we are going to just give you a little bit of an update.
[time=860] Some things that are going on around Black Hawk that we'd love for you all to be aware of.
[time=865] We want you to not only be aware, but we'd love for many of you, all of you to come and be a part of these things.
[time=871] We think they're pretty exciting and pretty important.
[time=874] Not the least of which is a brand new series that we begin this week that you'll
[time=880] be able to watch on the broadcast over the next four weeks.
[time=883] It's called I Am Jonah.
[time=885] We've never taught through the whole story of Jonah in all my years here.
[time=889] I'm really excited about it.
[time=891] Webby, as you think about the story of Jonah and our chance to teach it, what are you excited about as you think about the impact it could have on our people?
[time=899] I'm excited because Jonah is like me, because he's a jumble.
[time=903] He's the good things, the things that maybe aren't so good.
[time=907] His prayers are sometimes sincere and insincere.
[time=911] He does well.
[time=912] He doesn't do so well.
[time=913] I kind of like my life.
[time=914] It's not like this.
[time=915] It's sort of all over the place, like Jonah's is.
[time=917] It's a chance for us to be honest about life, spiritual life.
[time=921] It's a chance for us to be honest about what it looks like for us to follow after Christ.
[time=926] Jonah's story, he followed God in the Old Testament, was a jumble.
[time=930] My life can often be a jumble.
[time=932] It's a way through all those things that can be helpful, just to be honest and say, "It looks so good sometimes." I like the way we've titled it.
[time=940] I know, as I read about Jonah again and study this book, I am Jonah.
[time=946] I know you are Jonah.
[time=949] And my guess is many of you are Jonah's as well, and we hope it's an encouragement to you.
[time=954] I can't wait to see what God's going to do with it.
[time=957] I shine.
[time=958] I shine is coming.
[time=960] I hope you'll write this down.
[time=962] March 8th, coming up 6 p.m. right here in the worship center at Blackhawk.
[time=969] I shine is an organization.
[time=972] They do an amazing job at bringing a preteen.
[time=976] I think you've got a preteen in your home.
[time=979] I've got a couple of, I've got a preteen and an early teen in mine.
[time=983] I shine ministers to tweeners, fourth, fifth, sixth grade kids.
[time=989] And it's a high energy music, video, stage experience with kids from all over the country.
[time=998] They've got Spencer Kane, the rubies, Rachel Chan, and Abigail Duhan.
[time=1004] I mean, it's going to be an amazing performance, but it's also a very interactive event.
[time=1011] The gospel is a huge part of it.
[time=1014] Good solid values and great entertainment and a chance for your kids in mind to really be encouraged.
[time=1021] I shine.
[time=1022] March 8th, 6 p.m. right here at Blackhawk.
[time=1025] And you can get your $10 tickets, I think, online.
[time=1029] We're excited about that.
[time=1030] One thing we want you to know about is Grow Groups.
[time=1033] I've mentioned this to you before.
[time=1035] Steve Webster has had a huge hand in moving the Grow Group ministry forward here at Blackhawk.
[time=1041] So tell the folks what they could be a part of if they were willing to sign up online and be a part of our Grow Group offering this spring.
[time=1049] What's most exciting about Grow Groups is that it's for everybody.
[time=1052] There's nobody that wouldn't benefit from what we have to offer on this front.
[time=1056] Coming out of our Real Men series in January, we've got something offered for men, for women,
[time=1063] for those interested in learning about spiritual life at all levels.
[time=1066] So there's nobody, again, for whom Grow Groups is not intended.
[time=1070] It's hard to engage in the challenges of spiritual life and spiritual formation, to grow.
[time=1075] It's hard sometimes.
[time=1077] We want to make it as easy and as obvious and as accessible as we possibly can.
[time=1081] And this is the most recent opportunity for us to do that.
[time=1083] There's a chance to sign up online.
[time=1085] It's already available on our website.
[time=1087] We're starting in a few weeks.
[time=1089] Could not be more excited about those teachers and leaders in our church who are involved in making these opportunities for people.
[time=1095] Again, easy and obvious and accessible to get connected with people, even for a few weeks.
[time=1100] Five weeks, right?
[time=1101] Five weeks hopefully is an on-ramp to more permanent community.
[time=1105] Absolutely.
[time=1106] And if any of you are interested in joining or even looking at the groups that are online and they can see what classes, what groups are actually being offered, what the theme is,
[time=1117] what the book is, what the study is going to be.
[time=1120] So I hope you'll look into that.
[time=1122] And we would love to meet you and have you join us on Thursday night starting February 27th,
[time=1128] 6.30 p.m. right here at Blackhawk Grow Groups.
[time=1132] Another thing that we really enjoy doing, I think it's a challenge for some people.
[time=1138] We see it honestly as a ministry and that is the blood drive.
[time=1143] The American Red Cross does a fantastic job of helping people who are in need.
[time=1149] You and I both know today that there are times when blood is needed.
[time=1153] And we take that seriously.
[time=1155] We want to be a service to our community.
[time=1157] We want to be an encouragement to those who might have needs.
[time=1160] And so we encourage our people here at Blackhawk to be a part of the blood drive.
[time=1165] It's coming up on Sunday, March 2nd.
[time=1168] And right here on Sunday mornings down in the four year, they set it all up and in between
[time=1174] services and then after second hour, you could come and be a part of this as we do our very
[time=1180] best to give that which is needed and that which is helpful in a very practical, very real physical way, so the blood drive.
[time=1188] The other thing that we want to mention to you today is something that we call welcome to Blackhawk.
[time=1193] Webby, you've been a part of this with me almost on a quarterly basis.
[time=1198] What we do is we dedicate about an hour and a half on a Sunday night.
[time=1203] And we call it welcome to Blackhawk.
[time=1205] And the whole idea is that people who are part of our broadcast audience, people who have maybe come to the gatherings on Sunday morning and they've come for two or three or four weeks, they feel sort of new, not quite sure where to go, not quite sure how to connect.
[time=1221] We invite them to welcome to Blackhawk.
[time=1223] A chance for us to get to know you, for you to get to know us.
[time=1227] What's one thing, as you think about those times, Webby that you've been a part of, what's one thing that stands out to you as being a real encouragement regarding our welcome to Blackhawk nights?
[time=1237] People have come who have been around for a long time or just a short time.
[time=1241] So it's a good chance to not take anything for granted.
[time=1243] So we're offering this opportunity for all people to be welcomed.
[time=1247] So all are welcome at Blackhawk, whether you've been around for weeks and weeks of time, months and months of time or longer, or even just for a few weeks.
[time=1254] That's something that we value very important is that people feel welcome in this place, whether or not it's been this much or that much.
[time=1260] Absolutely.
[time=1261] And of the many welcome to Blackhawk nights that we've had, I've always been struck by how many people are there because they first started connecting with Blackhawk through the Bible
[time=1272] hour, through this very broadcast.
[time=1274] It's an amazing thing and I'm really, really thankful for it.
[time=1277] Lastly, and this is kind of just a way for us to segue into what you're about to watch
[time=1283] this morning on our broadcast.
[time=1285] Webby, we had a chance over the last five, six weeks to engage in a teaching series called
[time=1291] Real Men.
[time=1292] And we've heard from those of you in the viewing audience, we know that it was an encouragement to so many of you.
[time=1297] The last Sunday, we split everybody up.
[time=1301] The women stayed in the worship center with Karen Beck.
[time=1304] And those of you in our viewing audience, you saw that message last week.
[time=1308] Now today, you're going to see what happened down in the gym.
[time=1311] We separated men from women, took all the guys down to the gym, and we just had a fantastic
[time=1317] time of going back over the series and trying to help our guys process what they heard.
[time=1322] What was that experience like for you as we were together with all the guys, both hours, down in the gym?
[time=1327] It was a deeply humbling and encouraging thing for me to learn from the other guys on that
[time=1334] stage, just to watch the interaction that we had in that room.
[time=1338] I felt very encouraged, very humbled just to be a part of something that was that special.
[time=1343] I had so much to learn as a father, as a husband, as a worker, as a friend.
[time=1347] I felt like the things that we had to offer on that morning were for everybody at all stages, all kinds of men.
[time=1354] And I learned lots about myself that morning from hearing from other people.
[time=1358] I agree.
[time=1360] So I would say this, especially to you men that are watching.
[time=1364] I hope you'll listen to today's message.
[time=1366] I hope you'll take some notes.
[time=1368] I hope you'll consider what you hear.
[time=1370] If you hear anything, if the Spirit of God prompts you in any way, we would love to be of help.
[time=1376] We'd love to be an encouragement to you.
[time=1378] Please make sure and contact us if we can do that.
[time=1381] Thank you so much for tuning in.
[time=1384] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=1387] Let me just say this.
[time=1389] There may be, and we won't, we won't like single anybody out.
[time=1394] It's all good.
[time=1395] Somebody may have showed up today.
[time=1396] You might be new.
[time=1397] And you may have walked in, and all of a sudden you're getting herded down a hallway.
[time=1401] It's really good to see you.
[time=1403] My name's Kelly.
[time=1404] I have the privilege of serving on a team here at Blackhawk.
[time=1407] And we really do view it that way.
[time=1409] One of a number of people that have the privilege of contributing to this effort here.
[time=1416] I've been here for about 18 years total, surrounded by people who some have been here for as long or longer as I have.
[time=1425] Others are newer to the scene, but we are a team of people that are doing our very best with God's help to try and help men like you.
[time=1437] And women like those that are still back down in the big room, trying to help people grow in their faith in their relationship with Christ.
[time=1445] We're trying to, as we say here, we're trying to complete people.
[time=1449] And we realize that in completing people, that means some who are just beginning.
[time=1455] And others who have been at it for a long, long time.
[time=1459] And what a privilege to be able to jump in with folks on that very large continuum to try and encourage them.
[time=1466] And what it really means and looks like to follow Christ.
[time=1470] We think that's the ball game.
[time=1472] Whoever you are, whatever you do, whatever your days look like, whatever your family looks like, whatever your life has looked like, we believe the whole ball game is you understanding what it means to follow Jesus Christ.
[time=1486] And if we can help you in that endeavor, we think that's a pretty good thing.
[time=1490] And so we're really, really grateful to get to have you here today.
[time=1494] I want to ask, I want to ask a friend to join me up here, Jim Dody.
[time=1500] If he'd come up, I'm really thankful that Jim is willing to be with us this morning.
[time=1506] He's going to be here both hours.
[time=1508] And really what I asked Jim to do was just simply this.
[time=1512] To just share with you guys, just from his own heart and from his own journey, some of the things that he has enjoyed, some of the things that over these last few weeks, I know that God has been encouraging him.
[time=1523] And kind of speaking to him through the series.
[time=1526] And I want to share with you some of the things that he's learning and some of the stuff that's going on inside him.
[time=1531] The thing I'm really grateful for is that Jim is, Jim's an elder here at Black Hawk.
[time=1538] We have elders that give oversight to our church and our ministry.
[time=1542] They're good men and they care deeply about our church and our school.
[time=1548] And some of them are elders.
[time=1554] Some of them are a little younger, but they're all qualified and good, godly men.
[time=1560] What I enjoy about Jim is he's a little on the older side.
[time=1563] He doesn't mind me saying that.
[time=1565] He's a little on the older side.
[time=1567] And a lot of times what I've seen over the years...
[time=1569] I like to hear him introduce a female that way.
[time=1571] Yeah.
[time=1572] We can get away with it here.
[time=1575] A lot of times what I've seen in all my years is I've seen a lot of older guys who get to a point and they're sort of done.
[time=1584] They're done growing.
[time=1586] They're done being humble.
[time=1588] They're done being soft and moldable.
[time=1591] Sometimes you see, elders get to a point where they sort of know everything.
[time=1597] And that's not a good place to be.
[time=1599] And I'm so thankful for the older men and so many of them in our church who are here week after week and their hearts are open and they want to grow and they want to learn.
[time=1609] And so I'm thankful that Jim's wanting to do this.
[time=1611] He's got some things he wants to share with you and really thankful for Jim Dody.
[time=1615] Go right ahead.
[time=1616] When Kelly asked me to take a couple minutes and do this, my first reaction was, "I love you, buddy, but I don't think so."
[time=1623] I mean, I'm an accountant. I sit in front of a computer monitor all day long and input numbers into little boxes.
[time=1631] I don't talk to groups of people.
[time=1633] In fact, my wife Marie would say, "I don't talk at all," but that's another.
[time=1638] I think the most meaningful thing about this series was last weeks where they talked about the group of four pastors talked about sanctification.
[time=1651] Sanctification is this $20 church word that pastors use to impress all of us.
[time=1657] But I think it was Jesse last week who defined it.
[time=1661] And this probably, Jesse's here.
[time=1663] I hope I don't mess this up too bad.
[time=1665] It was for my notes.
[time=1666] But I think he defined the process.
[time=1669] Sanctification is the process of, with God's help, growing to be more like Jesus on a steady basis.
[time=1676] Is that close, Jesse, wherever you are?
[time=1678] Okay. Does that mean there won't be bumps along the way?
[time=1683] I hope not.
[time=1685] I mean, I hope there would not be bumps, but there will be.
[time=1689] No, the process does not go like this.
[time=1693] It goes, hopefully, up with a few bumps along the road.
[time=1698] I think maybe a way to look at it would be to say, look at it on a specific date and say on January 1, 2013, where am I on January 1, 2014 in comparison?
[time=1713] Hopefully, it should be going up like that.
[time=1716] And I think what made that lesson the most meaningful to me is that the sanctification process in my life took a bit of a hit last year.
[time=1726] I don't think I could honestly look at myself on 1-1 of 14 and say I'm more sanctified than I was on 1-1-13.
[time=1736] I know with God's help and prayer, I can fix that this year so that when I look at 1-1-15, I can say, yeah, there was a little bit of improvement.
[time=1745] Another thing that was important to me about the sanctification message is that as you steadily and spiritually become more and more like Jesus,
[time=1755] in the sanctification process, you are probably doing okay in the other three areas that we've talked about in the Real Men series.
[time=1765] If you remember, the other three areas were love, lead, and serve.
[time=1769] If I'm loving Marie the way I'm supposed to, if I'm loving my kids the way I'm supposed to, if I'm loving God the way I'm supposed to, I'm probably doing okay in the sanctification process.
[time=1782] If I'm not loving, if I'm not loving leading and serving like I should be, then I'm probably not going like this.
[time=1792] I don't think the pastor said that last week, so if I really messed that up, go ahead and feel free to run me through.
[time=1801] That's it, Kelly. Thank you guys for listening.
[time=1806] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1811] All right, come on, Josh. Come on, Jess. Thanks, Jim. Good job. Really appreciate Jim doing that.
[time=1817] It's encouraging, like I said, to see older guys continuing to give themselves to the growth process.
[time=1825] I don't know who said this to me at one point, they did say it, but maybe it was my mom, I can't remember.
[time=1831] But she said that she was talking to an older gentleman, older than you, Jim, much older, who had been in ministry for many, many years, 50, 60 years.
[time=1840] And she said, "What have you learned in your whole time serving and ministering the Lord during your lifetime?"
[time=1846] And he said, "I've just begun to scratch the surface." He was over, you know, 80 years old.
[time=1851] I love that about people like Jim that they're just not done. They're not done. They're always ready and always willing to learn more.
[time=1858] I love it also that he said that last year things didn't go so well. That's what my life is like.
[time=1863] There are good days, there are bad days, but God stays the same. He's the constant that we're just saying about.
[time=1868] So I hope that Jim encourages you, because he sure encourages me, that he's an example of faithful service, but also just a real honest and humility that he's on this journey that we're all in together, whether you have a wife, whether you have kids, or whether you don't.
[time=1882] Whether you're an accountant or whether you're out hunting bears on the weekend. Whatever your story is that God has something for you as a man.
[time=1891] So, yeah.
[time=1893] Hey, here's how we're going to do this. We're going to just take the four weeks. Hopefully you got to hear all four.
[time=1898] If not, we're going to review them real quickly, and each guy up here is just going to take just a few minutes on each of the four weeks, kind of give you an overview, some things to think about.
[time=1908] And then we don't want you to talk into this morning. We want you to talk. We want you to be able to just process some of the stuff.
[time=1914] So each guy's just got a question or two that you're going to have on the screen, and when each of us is done with our one week review, we're going to give you a question, and then just ask you to talk about it.
[time=1925] Just with somebody next to you, somebody around you, maybe two, three, four of you. Please don't get weirded out about that.
[time=1932] Turn around, talk to somebody, answer a question, get to know each other just a little bit better, and be encouraged as we go.
[time=1938] Four weeks overview real quick, starting with real. Are you on love?
[time=1942] I'm on love.
[time=1943] Yeah, real men. Week one was real men love, and Josh is going to share a few things about that.
[time=1948] Of course, Josh's love. Of course he's love.
[time=1950] Yeah.
[time=1952] Real men love, and I think, you know, as Jim said before, they all really interrelate.
[time=1959] So as you love, you're going to lead. As you love, you're going to serve. As you love, you're going to sanctify.
[time=1964] But one of the things that Kelly had talked about in that first time was Ephesians 5, and looking back to just the person and work of Christ.
[time=1973] So Ephesians 5, 25 says, you know, husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.
[time=1983] So I'm convinced that the only way that you're really going to love your spouse and love your children or love your friends is if you are first and foremost understanding just how much God loves you.
[time=1998] Galatians chapter one, verse six says this, and I'll get to a quick point here.
[time=2005] Galatians is a book all about defending the gospel, the truth that Christ died for our sins, and it has nothing to do with our performance.
[time=2013] And in Galatians chapter one, verse six, it says that we have been called into the grace of Christ.
[time=2020] And so what that's talking about is this, when you trust Christ fully, you now are relating with God on a completely different basis than you had before.
[time=2031] Before you come to Christ, it's all about your performance. Are you keeping the law or are you not keeping the law?
[time=2038] Are you obeying God's commands or are you not obeying God's commands?
[time=2042] So when you enter into a relationship with Christ, now it's not based upon your performance anymore, it's based upon the performance of Christ credit to you for on your behalf.
[time=2055] Now it still matters, whether you obey or not, but it doesn't matter to the extent that God is going to love you no matter what, not based upon your performance, but based upon the performance of Christ.
[time=2068] If you understand this, whether it's a good day or a bad day, God delights in you, not because of you, but because of what Jesus has done for you.
[time=2079] God loves you way more than you understand.
[time=2083] Now, when you start to understand that, now move that into the realm of how you relate to your spouse or your kids or friends for that matter.
[time=2095] The way that I love my spouse should not be dependent upon my spouse's performance.
[time=2103] In other words, when I stood at that altar and I said, I'm going to love you, Paula, for better, for worse, for richer, for poor, doesn't matter, right?
[time=2112] So my love isn't based upon what she does.
[time=2115] My love is based upon my commitment to her, but what happens in my life is that if she's in a bad mood, then I say forget it.
[time=2124] I'm not going to treat you as well as I should because you're not making me happy at that point, right?
[time=2130] See what happens is I think we fear that nobody is going to love us or make us happy as much as we will.
[time=2139] And so we try to find love and happiness in all these other relationships, but what we need to understand is nobody is going to love us better or more than Jesus or God can.
[time=2150] And so we put the burden upon our spouse or upon our kids or upon our friends to act in certain ways that will make us happy and make us feel loved.
[time=2160] And what I'm saying is this, that we need to release our spouse and release our kids and release our friends from having to bear that burden of making us happy because only Jesus can really do that.
[time=2175] Now, when I'm dealing with my kids, sure it matters whether they obey or not, but I'm never going to stop loving them.
[time=2184] My disposition toward them isn't going to change.
[time=2187] It's just that the consequences that they face and the communication that I have for them, it's going to be full of love, not anger or not some sort of angst that I have because they're not performing or they're not acting in a way that they want to act.
[time=2204] So my question this morning is we think about just real men love.
[time=2207] Again, it comes back to understanding, can we put that on the screen real quick, Jesse?
[time=2213] I can't see that.
[time=2217] I still love you though.
[time=2220] So with the understanding that God loves us unconditionally without having to perform for him or meet certain expectations, that's huge right there.
[time=2230] That's the gospel.
[time=2234] Think through the following questions.
[time=2236] Does your spouse feel like she has to perform in order for you to love her?
[time=2242] Next question, if you go to the next screen, at times is your love for your spouse, your children, your friends conditioned upon certain expectations that you have of them?
[time=2254] If so, what is one of these expectations you can let go of?
[time=2258] Just to give you some really stupid examples in my own life with my kids.
[time=2263] If for some reason they're not obeying, I expect them to obey and certainly it's good for them to obey.
[time=2269] But my expectations of them to obey get to the point where I get angered at them if they don't.
[time=2277] And now all of a sudden I'm not loving them anymore.
[time=2281] So can I release them from having to obey?
[time=2286] That sounds really scary, doesn't it?
[time=2288] Can I release them from having to obey me so that whether they're obeying me or not, they feel my love no matter what?
[time=2296] Now, that love may be some discipline, but it's still love and it's coming from a caring heart, not from an angered heart.
[time=2305] My spouse, again, sometimes when she spends too much time in my estimation working on her hair in the morning, and I'm ready to go, right?
[time=2312] And we're five minutes late and she's still working on her hair.
[time=2315] At that point I stop delighting in her.
[time=2319] I stop viewing her as the gift that she really is from God to me and I get frustrated.
[time=2324] And now all of a sudden I'm short with her, I'm cold with her, and I'm not really loving her.
[time=2329] And I'm really not shepherding her either at that moment, right?
[time=2333] I think to find her because she's got some idols in her life just like we all do at that point.
[time=2338] But I'm wanting her to perform.
[time=2342] I'm wanting her to not go through that whole exercise so that we can get out the door so that I can be happy.
[time=2348] Am I willing to release that and just say, "You know what?
[time=2354] Regardless of how you perform, I'm going to love you no matter what." And so that's real men love.
[time=2361] So, take some time and ask yourself those questions.
[time=2365] Is your love for your spouse, children, friends conditioned upon certain expectations you have of them?
[time=2370] If so, what's one of those expectations you can let go of?
[time=2374] So, great question.
[time=2376] Okay, room and lead.
[time=2377] I'm just recapping from the last, when KB did this in the big service.
[time=2382] So, let me be the first to say that I'm not perfect leader.
[time=2386] I know it's surprise to everybody here I'm not perfect.
[time=2389] It's okay.
[time=2390] Rang is.
[time=2391] I'm not.
[time=2392] But I'm working on it.
[time=2394] But the first thing KB talked about is real men lead.
[time=2398] They step into, not away from, challenge that life brings.
[time=2402] I really like that about how he talked about Abraham.
[time=2405] When God said, "Hey, you need to take your son and you need to sacrifice him." And he stepped into that even though it was confusing and it was hard.
[time=2414] And even thought of that horrible thought of actually having to take your son up there and sacrifice him, he still stepped into it even though it was confusing.
[time=2422] And I think a lot of times when we get confused, we either stop or we freeze or we just aren't sure.
[time=2430] And so that was step into and then the second one was step up to face your fear.
[time=2435] It's okay to admit that we have some fears in life.
[time=2439] If you look to Jesus and I like what the video said about Jesus was in the ultimate picture of masculinity and there was some fear in the garden.
[time=2448] And this is Jesus the God man and he's on the floor, he's laying there and he's crying.
[time=2454] He's crying out to God like, "Take this from me.
[time=2458] I don't want to go there tomorrow." He knows what's coming at this point.
[time=2464] He doesn't want to do it but he steps up and he accepts it and he goes and because of that we have salvation.
[time=2470] So he steps up and then the third one is step on like squish it, step on passivity.
[time=2476] And we talked about the example of Adam in the garden when the snakes wheeling and dealing with the gal
[time=2483] and he's over back there playing ESPN and playing games and nowhere to be found.
[time=2487] He's like, "Ah, you deal with that." Instead of stepping on passivity and punching that snake in the face, he allowed it to happen, he allowed her to be deceived.
[time=2498] And so when we hang back, when we refuse or when we choose not to step on passivity,
[time=2505] so many things can happen in the home with your kids, with your spouse and your workplace.
[time=2510] We just have to step on it and squish it.
[time=2513] And I think for me it comes down to this idea in Luke 17 where Jesus is kind of talking to the apostles
[time=2521] and he's calling them to do some hard things and specifically talking about them how to forgive people and even if they do it a million times, forgive them.
[time=2529] And their response is increase our faith.
[time=2533] And I think that's what one of the prayers that I have for my life is to increase my faith because there's so many times when I just want to step away from challenges, when I want to run from my fears or when I want to just sit back and hang and let somebody else deal with it.
[time=2547] But I need God to increase my faith so that I can deal with those things well.
[time=2552] So those are the three things.
[time=2554] Step into you, step up, step on.
[time=2556] And my question for you is there's a few you guys can talk about them.
[time=2560] Oh, I always do that.
[time=2562] Sorry.
[time=2563] I'm a rookie at this thing.
[time=2565] While you're looking at that, one of the things that has helped me on the passivity stepping on and I'm still very passive at times, but the idea that if I want to watch a game or if I want to do something else instead of deal with that, I start to think, okay, what is that going to do for me?
[time=2579] What is that game going to do for me?
[time=2581] And sure, there's times when it's okay to just watch a game and hang out and veg.
[time=2585] But the reality is it's not going to do for me what I think it's going to do for me.
[time=2590] I think it's really going to, again, make me happy or provide me some sort of fulfillment.
[time=2595] And in all reality, the truth is when I step into the lives of my kids or my wife, that's actually going to bring way more fulfillment than that game.
[time=2604] Very good.
[time=2605] There's just talking to Josh.
[time=2607] And again, I know I look around the room and we're all at different phases of life.
[time=2613] So to some of you, this is old hat to others of you.
[time=2616] You're right with us.
[time=2619] And I certainly have experienced this.
[time=2621] Josh was just saying that he's got a Valentine's trip planned.
[time=2626] He's going to take his two daughters away.
[time=2629] Makes us look bad.
[time=2630] Terrible person.
[time=2631] I'm a terrible person.
[time=2632] He's got this trip planned for his ten and eight.
[time=2636] Ten and eight-year-old daughters who are both of them in public school and public private.
[time=2644] Not that there's a whole lot of difference on this front, but he's right in that he understands
[time=2650] they're starting at ten and eight.
[time=2652] They're starting to hear things about sex.
[time=2659] They're starting to hear stuff.
[time=2660] You guys know it's true.
[time=2661] I know it's true.
[time=2663] And what they're starting to hear wouldn't be, for the most part, what you and I would want.
[time=2668] It certainly isn't what Josh wants their foundation to be on those fronts.
[time=2674] You with me?
[time=2675] So he's thinking, "I got to talk to my girls." He's been planning on it.
[time=2679] He's been planning on it.
[time=2680] You know, praying about it.
[time=2681] Thinking about how he's going to, on a trip away, look his ten and eight-year-old daughters in the eye and really communicate with them the basics of how this thing works.
[time=2691] And he said he's laying in bed last night and it just hit him.
[time=2694] You know, I think I'll do that next year.
[time=2696] Maybe next year.
[time=2699] And you know it.
[time=2700] And I know it every time.
[time=2701] There's so many times when passivity just starts to rear its head.
[time=2705] Fear shows up, right?
[time=2707] You know you should do something and you lay there in bed or you're driving in your car
[time=2713] and you just talk yourself out of what you should do.
[time=2720] And I'm so proud of him for I think he'll do it.
[time=2723] And I believe God will give him the grace to do it well.
[time=2726] But we all feel that.
[time=2727] Steve, Webby.
[time=2730] When I played football in high school, my coaches would always say, "If we're going to make a mistake, make it full speed." And it's true because it's dangerous in football to be passive, to be tentative.
[time=2741] But as men, I think it's a constant.
[time=2743] I was talking to Jesse about my struggles and my marriage that I like to sit in my hands and pass the buck.
[time=2749] And I will say, Josh, that my wife is having a conversation with our daughter, not me.
[time=2753] So just for the record.
[time=2756] Let me know how it goes.
[time=2757] I will.
[time=2758] Okay.
[time=2759] I think it's easy for us to simply say, "Well, it'll work itself out." And almost nothing ever does.
[time=2765] Just work itself out.
[time=2766] It takes effort.
[time=2767] It takes initiative.
[time=2769] And on this service front, two verses come to mind.
[time=2772] I ask you to jot them down if you wouldn't mind real quick.
[time=2775] Two verses to jot down.
[time=2776] One is Mark 1045, famously what Jesus says of himself.
[time=2780] "Even the son of man didn't come to be served but to serve." It's Mark 1045.
[time=2789] And I think oftentimes we take this posture, guys.
[time=2791] It's like, "Well, he was Jesus.
[time=2793] He could do all those things.
[time=2794] Of course he could serve.
[time=2795] He was Jesus.
[time=2796] He was God walking around in flesh.
[time=2798] I would encourage you to take the opposite point of view because of the verse I'm now going to read to you." Or say to you, Philippians 2 verse 7.
[time=2804] It was Mark 1045 and now it's Philippians 2 7.
[time=2807] Philippians 2 7 says that he took the form of a servant.
[time=2811] He was enthroned in heaven.
[time=2814] The eternal son of God.
[time=2815] And then he became a man.
[time=2817] He took the form of a servant.
[time=2818] So I would encourage you with this.
[time=2820] If Jesus can do that, if he can lower himself that far to serve us, then you can serve the
[time=2827] people in your life.
[time=2828] There are some boys in the room.
[time=2830] Boys, listen to me very carefully.
[time=2832] The way you treat your mom is the way that you're going to ultimately interact with your
[time=2838] wife someday.
[time=2839] How's that going?
[time=2842] How are your words and your actions towards your mom?
[time=2845] That's because it's going to say a lot about the condition of your heart.
[time=2848] We won't call them heart pretties, but we'll call them something else.
[time=2851] It's a good term though.
[time=2852] It is a good term.
[time=2853] What it means.
[time=2854] I think that's for you.
[time=2856] How are you serving your mom?
[time=2858] Serving your mom is what you do and what you don't do.
[time=2860] Isn't just that.
[time=2861] Guys that aren't married, that you're interested in girls.
[time=2864] I hope that's true of all of you interested in girls.
[time=2867] If you're dating, what you do and what you just nailed it last week.
[time=2872] The way that you interact with the opposite sex.
[time=2875] Even the ones that you're not going to be dating, are you kind with them?
[time=2878] Are you gentle with them?
[time=2879] That's service.
[time=2880] That's what it means.
[time=2882] Treating people with respect.
[time=2884] Even because they're made in the image of God, deserve your respect.
[time=2888] By what you do and by what you do.
[time=2890] That's a service that you can do for them.
[time=2892] Now men, if you have a family, if you have a wife, if you have kids.
[time=2896] That's true for us on so many different fronts.
[time=2899] If Jesus can lower himself that far, so can you.
[time=2903] If you're going to make a mistake, make it full speed.
[time=2905] Just do something.
[time=2906] Don't do nothing in what it comes to service.
[time=2909] The question up on the screen for you to think about this morning is just to turn and talk to somebody else.
[time=2915] There's somebody around here that you haven't talked to yet that's just sitting there not talking to somebody, find them.
[time=2919] Here's the question that I would hold out with you guys this morning.
[time=2922] As you think about what it means to serve as a man, take a moment to think about how you've seen others serve or how you even serve yourself.
[time=2928] I know a lot of you guys are serving around this place.
[time=2932] Let me say one thing before I forget it.
[time=2935] Kelly talked about this last week about serving in the church, having this kind of sanctifying role in the church.
[time=2941] Guys, we need you.
[time=2943] We need you in this place.
[time=2945] This is the church.
[time=2946] The church isn't a building.
[time=2947] It's people.
[time=2948] So you can't serve wrong.
[time=2950] Just get involved and do something in your church.
[time=2953] We need you in this place.
[time=2955] Encourage each other toward love and good deeds we're supposed to do.
[time=2958] Be specific as you help your brothers figure out what it means to serve.
[time=2963] I'm going to just bounce off what Steve just said.
[time=2966] I couldn't agree more.
[time=2967] I couldn't agree more with his comment that he just made to young men in the room.
[time=2974] Boys, young guys, what he just said to you about the way you treat your mom is really
[time=2980] true, and I will just say the obvious to you dads as it relates to your younger son.
[time=2990] He'll treat his mom the way he sees you treat her.
[time=2996] So I know what it's like to see a young boy treat his mom in a way that infuriates me.
[time=3006] And then the infuriation quickly turns to shame because it doesn't take long for me to realize
[time=3014] where he learned that.
[time=3016] And so be careful, young guys, what Mr. Webster just said to you is true.
[time=3021] Oh, treat your mom with respect and honor and dads.
[time=3026] Oh, how we need us as dads to model that very spirit in the way that we talk, in the way
[time=3034] that we respond.
[time=3037] Really, really important.
[time=3038] Hey, let me just say this about sanctification.
[time=3040] It's already been referenced a few times, which is good.
[time=3043] So I'll keep it brief.
[time=3046] Guys, God's design for you as men.
[time=3049] Clearly, in Scripture, we saw it last week.
[time=3052] God's design for you as a man is that you would be involved, not withdrawn, that you would
[time=3058] be involved in the spiritual growth process.
[time=3064] Your spiritual growth, your wife's spiritual growth, your kids' spiritual growth, and the
[time=3070] spiritual growth of the body, the church.
[time=3074] It's clearly what he has called us to and clearly the opportunity that you and I have.
[time=3081] Let me just say something about the body of Christ.
[time=3084] Let me say something to you all individually about this church, this family that God has
[time=3091] given us.
[time=3092] We desperately, I want to agree with Steve again.
[time=3095] He just said this and I want to just reiterate this.
[time=3097] We desperately need men in this place who are growing.
[time=3104] We need you to grow.
[time=3108] If you're not growing, you're dying.
[time=3111] If you're not moving forward, you're regressing.
[time=3114] There's no neutral in this thing, guys.
[time=3118] And we desperately need you to be growing.
[time=3123] We need January 1.
[time=3126] You know what?
[time=3127] We need March 1 to be different than February 1.
[time=3132] We need you to be growing.
[time=3134] And I want to just say this to you.
[time=3136] You're going to see Steve just mentioned Todd Everett's in men's ministry starting on Thursday nights.
[time=3141] Next week I think you'll see in the bulletin on the website New Grow Groups.
[time=3146] We do grow groups twice a year.
[time=3149] And we say it to you.
[time=3150] Twice a year we've been saying it for five years and we're not going to stop.
[time=3154] If you're not growing, you're dying.
[time=3156] You need to grow.
[time=3157] Your family needs you to grow.
[time=3159] This church needs you to grow.
[time=3161] And it's a scheduling thing.
[time=3163] And you're going to have to figure out how to do it.
[time=3165] And this time, sometimes we do them Sunday mornings, sometimes we do them Thursday nights.
[time=3169] It's good for some.
[time=3170] It's not for others.
[time=3171] You know what?
[time=3172] Do your best to figure it out.
[time=3173] But you're going to see a list of about six opportunities.
[time=3177] And they're really good opportunities.
[time=3180] And they cover a wide range of topics that I think could be of help to you in your life.
[time=3184] Make the commitment if you can.
[time=3187] If you can in any way make the commitment.
[time=3190] Do it.
[time=3191] Join a grow group.
[time=3192] Bring a body.
[time=3193] Bring your son.
[time=3194] Whatever you've got to do, we need you to grow.
[time=3199] Because when you grow, guess what?
[time=3202] We grow.
[time=3204] You want Black Hawk to grow, you want Black Hawk to deepen, you want Black Hawk to expand, you want Black Hawk to make more disciples.
[time=3212] I do.
[time=3213] Guess what?
[time=3214] It's not up to me.
[time=3215] It's up to you.
[time=3216] It's up to me.
[time=3217] It's up to us as men to grow.
[time=3219] We need you to grow.
[time=3222] Second thing I want to just say, men serving, Black Hawk needs you to grow.
[time=3225] Men, Black Hawk needs you to serve.
[time=3227] Josh and I were just talking about this.
[time=3229] And this isn't for everybody.
[time=3230] This is an example.
[time=3231] But listen, don't lose this.
[time=3234] Josh and I were just talking about how my kids have been parenting for 22 years.
[time=3239] We've been at Black Hawk for 18 years.
[time=3242] My oldest son, my youngest son.
[time=3244] Russell's 21, Jake's 13, and my girls would say the same thing.
[time=3248] They all, five of them, point back to Sunday school from the earliest days.
[time=3254] And there were some phenomenal women that have made and continue to make an investment in my kids' lives.
[time=3261] My kids talk about the three or four men that got on the floor with them at early ages
[time=3270] and played and talked and taught and encouraged and made an investment in them.
[time=3277] Jake Bird's 13, I think from first grade to fourth grade.
[time=3281] Todd Everts made an investment in Jake's life and a whole bunch of other young men around this place and Todd just stayed with them for a number of years teaching and investing and discipling them.
[time=3291] So 13-year-old boy today in my home who has been forever impacted by a man.
[time=3296] And I'm grateful for that.
[time=3298] Some of you guys in this room, you could do it.
[time=3300] You could go to Janice and sign up today and you could teach young kids.
[time=3304] You could do it.
[time=3305] You could make a difference.
[time=3307] You could join our tech department.
[time=3308] You could help across the street during the week.
[time=3310] There's lots of ways that you can roll up your sleeves around here.
[time=3314] You could help with students, junior high kids, high school kids, need an investment by men
[time=3321] like some of you in this room.
[time=3324] So we need you to grow.
[time=3326] We need you to serve.
[time=3327] And then I wrote this down.
[time=3329] And this is fitting because we're going to end with this.
[time=3334] We need you to pray.
[time=3337] Black-hot needs men who will pray for a while.
[time=3343] I don't know.
[time=3344] For maybe a year, we were making a point of it to invite men to come down and pray before
[time=3352] the service.
[time=3353] It was a good time.
[time=3355] Some of you joined us in that.
[time=3358] Many of you didn't.
[time=3360] That's okay.
[time=3361] I think some maybe feel like that's awkward.
[time=3364] Public thing, that's fine.
[time=3366] But I want to just say this to you.
[time=3368] Publicly or privately.
[time=3372] I believe there's something to you praying, you going before God on our behalf.
[time=3382] You praying for us.
[time=3384] You, you men praying for our families.
[time=3388] You men praying for each other.
[time=3390] You men begging God for his favor and his direction and his blessing.
[time=3396] There's something about it when you as men are willing to pray on a regular basis for us
[time=3403] and for each other and for this effort.
[time=3406] I think it's important.
[time=3407] So listen, I'm just telling you, Josh, Jesse, Steve, myself, we would all sign off on this.
[time=3412] If any of you want to gather before a service down in the front and pray, you're welcome to, you don't need us to organize it, you don't need us to pull it off.
[time=3422] You want to gather down in front and get a bunch of guys and pray, do it.
[time=3426] Now, I would love for you to do it.
[time=3429] But I hope that you would pray for us privately.
[time=3431] I hope that you would make a commitment to pray for us Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
[time=3437] I just, boy, we need it.
[time=3441] This week, this week, I got called to do a funeral for a one-year-old.
[time=3449] Ever done a funeral for a one-year-old?
[time=3453] Wow, it's hard.
[time=3457] It's okay.
[time=3458] That's why I do what I do.
[time=3460] That's why you've asked me to do what I do.
[time=3462] These guys we face, you know, the same things.
[time=3464] I met this last week with a couple on the verge of a divorce, ready to utterly and absolutely
[time=3474] throw in the towel, and in this case, they're going to throw it in with attitude.
[time=3480] It's going to be ugly, horrible, if it keeps going the way it looks like it's going to
[time=3487] go.
[time=3488] There's pressures I face personally.
[time=3490] There's stuff these guys encounter on an everyday basis, many of the same things you encounter.
[time=3497] We've got staffing issues.
[time=3499] We've got financial challenges and blessings.
[time=3502] My point is, you want to pray for us?
[time=3506] We would love for you to pray for us.
[time=3511] Found out this morning, a brother here in the room has cancer.
[time=3516] About two days ago, a brother of ours here in this place just got cured of it.
[time=3525] They're dying.
[time=3526] They're being born.
[time=3527] They're breaking up.
[time=3528] They're coming together.
[time=3529] It's everything you could ever imagine, and we need guidance and direction.
[time=3533] Amen?
[time=3534] And so, as men, we need you to pray.
[time=3546] We need you to pray for us.
