[time=30] Together for our good, you are love, you give us more than we deserve, you are unfailing, and we are more conquerors.
[time=46] Save them, and you are future insecure, by your power we will not be shaken.
[time=57] And we will not be silent, sin is powerless, our God is for us.
[time=67] We will not be broken, he won't be defeated, death is powerless, our God is for us.
[time=80] [MUSIC]
[time=110] And you are future insecure, by your power we will not be shaken.
[time=119] We will not be silent, sin is powerless, our God is for us.
[time=129] We will not be broken, he won't be defeated, death is powerless, our God is for us.
[time=139] [MUSIC]
[time=151] I will sing, and we will sing, sing out, sing for the Lord, found in His love.
[time=165] And we will sing, sing out, sing to our God.
[time=175] Oh, we will sing, sing out, sing for the Lord, found in His love.
[time=191] Oh, we will not be shaken, we will not be silent, sin is powerless, our God is for us.
[time=217] We will not be broken, he won't be defeated, death is powerless, our God is for us.
[time=230] We will not be shaken, we will not be silent, sin is powerless, our God is for us.
[time=243] We will not be broken, he won't be defeated, death is powerless, our God is for us.
[time=256] [MUSIC]
[time=262] I am so glad that we get to declare that God is for us, that He has our back.
[time=269] This week I was reading in Isaiah 41 10 says, "Do not fear, for I am with you.
[time=277] Do not anxiously look about you, for I am your God.
[time=282] I will strengthen you, surely I will help you.
[time=286] Surely I will uphold you with my righteous right hand." We're going to be singing a song right now called "God is Able." And I know for many of us we have things that are keeping us down, that we're worried about, that we're anxious about,
[time=302] and that God is able to take care of.
[time=305] So I want to ask you guys as we're singing this song about God being able that you release those things to Him, and you declare that no matter what it is, He is able to take care of that.
[time=314] So sing this with us.
[time=316] [MUSIC]
[time=344] God is able.
[time=347] He will never fail.
[time=351] He is Almighty God.
[time=356] We do that all we seek, we do that all we ask.
[time=364] He has done great things, lifted up.
[time=371] He defeated the grave, raised to life.
[time=377] God is able, in His name we overcome.
[time=387] For the Lord, our God is able.
[time=394] [MUSIC]
[time=406] God is with us.
[time=409] God is on our side.
[time=413] He will make a way.
[time=418] And all we know, far above all we know.
[time=425] He has done great things, lifted up.
[time=433] He defeated the grave, raised to life.
[time=439] God is able, day to day.
[time=445] We overcome.
[time=449] For the Lord, our God is able.
[time=455] [MUSIC]
[time=465] God is with us.
[time=470] He will go before.
[time=473] He will never leave us.
[time=479] God is for us.
[time=483] He has opened arms.
[time=485] He will never fail us.
[time=491] He is with us, lifted up.
[time=494] He defeated the grave, raised to life.
[time=500] God is able, in His name.
[time=507] He overcome.
[time=510] For the Lord, our God is able.
[time=516] He defeated the grave, raised to life.
[time=524] God is able, in His name.
[time=531] We overcome.
[time=534] For the Lord, our God is able.
[time=553] [MUSIC - 7 seconds]
[time=577] Sing it to me, my hope is built.
[time=580] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=623] I cannot trust the sweetest faith.
[time=629] My hope is just in Jesus' name.
[time=636] Christ of love, cornerstone.
[time=643] We can make strong in the Savior's love through the storm.
[time=652] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[time=658] [MUSIC]
[time=664] When darkness seems to hide His face,
[time=670] I rest on His unchanging grace, if every high storm begins.
[time=683] My anger holds within.
[time=686] My goals.
[time=689] My anger holds within the veil.
[time=697] Christ of love, cornerstone.
[time=703] We can make strong in the Savior's love through the storm.
[time=713] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[time=735] Christ of love, cornerstone.
[time=741] We can make strong in the Savior's love through the storm.
[time=751] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[time=759] Christ, alone, cornerstone.
[time=767] We can make strong in the Savior's love through the storm.
[time=777] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[time=783] We can make strong in the Savior's love through the storm.
[time=1002] I'm just so thankful for that.
[time=1005] But God, this thing, it doesn't make any sense.
[time=1010] I know I said I would go anywhere and I would do anything,
[time=1016] but I never expected you to ask this of me.
[time=1022] So I need some answers, and I need them now.
[time=1027] You know, this thing that you're asking me to do it, I'm just going to be honest.
[time=1032] God, I don't want to do it, okay?
[time=1036] God, I made a pro-con list, a pro-con list.
[time=1039] I don't make pro-con lists.
[time=1042] I'll tell you this, okay?
[time=1045] It was all cons, and one pro, you.
[time=1051] So I know what my answer should be.
[time=1056] But how can you ask this of me?
[time=1059] How can you ask me to do this?
[time=1061] God, the very thought of it.
[time=1064] It just makes me so angry.
[time=1068] So here I am, God, again, at a crossroad.
[time=1071] I can either listen to you or I can run away.
[time=1077] Well, running away sounds a whole lot better right now.
[time=1082] Maybe some of you in the room this morning have argued with or wrestled with God at some level.
[time=1090] Maybe you've said the things, or at least thought the things that Corey just communicated.
[time=1096] Maybe there's been a circumstance that he's led you to.
[time=1099] Maybe there's been a calling that he's placed on your life.
[time=1102] Maybe there's been a prompting that he's been nudging you to go toward.
[time=1107] Sometimes, sometimes the things that God asks of us, sometimes the places he calls us to go.
[time=1113] Sometimes it can be quite confusing even at times a little maddening.
[time=1119] We come this morning in our gathering to a study of the book of Jonah.
[time=1124] We've been looking forward to this study, and most of you saw some of you, many of you in the room sort of know the story of Jonah.
[time=1133] But we've never actually just taken the time to put four weeks aside and just kind of teach you through the book.
[time=1138] And that's what we're going to do today, an individual, Jonah, who, like Corey, right there, wrestles with God.
[time=1145] And kind of arches his back a bit in terms of God's calling,
[time=1151] and we're going to see how this goes.
[time=1153] Jonah, really looking forward to it, actually looked at my phone this morning, and I saw a text from our youngest daughter, Evie.
[time=1164] She had asked me earlier today, if Jonah, if we were starting Jonah today, and I said yes, and then I realized why she had asked me that.
[time=1172] I was just, I love seeing that she writes a text to her older brother, her oldest brother, who some of you know is up in East Lansing at Michigan State,
[time=1182] plays a little basketball, he's got a game today, and so she writes and she says, she texts Russell, and she says, "Hey, Russ, it's Evie.
[time=1189] Just wanted to say good luck, and maybe you should think about reading the story of Jonah today and how God will get you out of any trouble you might be in, because you probably can't go to church, hope you will read it, love you, and good luck on your game, love Evie." That was nice, it's thinking about Jonah and thinking about her big brother, and we've been thinking about Jonah, and we've been thinking about you.
[time=1215] And our hope and our prayer is that God will use this to encourage and challenge you in the days to come.
[time=1221] Here's how to decide, we just thought we'd start with this.
[time=1225] Here's how to decide on whether or not the new Jonah series is really for you.
[time=1232] Have you ever, have you ever hated someone?
[time=1242] Have you ever disobeyed God and hoped he wouldn't notice?
[time=1250] Have you ever tried to bargain with God?
[time=1255] Have you ever tried to cut a deal with the most high?
[time=1261] Have you ever questioned God, God's calling, God's nudge, God's leading?
[time=1268] Have you ever questioned God, ever wondered why, why in the world he would do some of the things that he does?
[time=1276] Maybe you're questioning him today, like why is he doing what he's doing right now?
[time=1281] Have you ever complained to God?
[time=1284] Have you ever gotten angry at God?
[time=1287] How about this one?
[time=1288] Have you ever made it right with God and then made it wrong the very next day?
[time=1294] If the answer to any of the above questions is yes, then guess what?
[time=1299] You are Jonah.
[time=1304] And make no mistake, I am too.
[time=1306] We are Jonah.
[time=1308] Each and every one of us struggles as he did with one or all of these issues.
[time=1314] And so I'm inviting each and every one of you to join us over these next several weeks
[time=1320] as our teaching team begins a study and makes our way through a very real story
[time=1328] important that you know this.
[time=1330] A study of the book of Jonah joined us as we engage in a very real study.
[time=1337] This is not a parable.
[time=1339] This is not some tale.
[time=1341] I bump into people today, we start talking about Jonah.
[time=1344] And it's amazing to me how many people think that somehow it's just kind of this fable that got slid into the Bible.
[time=1350] And the truth is, I want you to know this, it's a true story.
[time=1354] It's not a parable, it's not a tale.
[time=1356] It's what happened to a guy named Jonah when God called him to go to Nineveh.
[time=1363] Join us as we look at a very real study and a very real man.
[time=1367] He is not a myth, he was not some made-up character.
[time=1371] It's a real guy, it's a real story, it's a real truth.
[time=1376] So let's read it, let's look into it.
[time=1379] I mentioned first hour, I'll say it to you, second hour, I kind of experimented with it this week, 24 minutes.
[time=1388] I'm not a great reader, not a fast reader, 24 minutes, it took me to read the book of Jonah.
[time=1394] It would probably take many of you less, not that you have to hurry, but my point is, would all of you, would most of you commit to read through the book of Jonah once a day
[time=1407] between now and next Sunday, would you commit to take this story, to take this truth,
[time=1413] to take this unbelievable interaction between God and a prophet named Jonah
[time=1419] and to watch how this thing unfolds, would you daily make a commitment 24 minutes, 25 minutes, maybe 30 and thoughtfully, prayerfully each day, morning, noon or night,
[time=1430] or maybe all three?
[time=1433] Would you read through the book of Jonah?
[time=1435] So many people, first hour, signified that they would, I hope you'll join us in that.
[time=1440] Let's read it, let's look into it, let's learn all that we can from the story of a man just like us.
[time=1446] The story of a man just like us and a God who called that man on a mission and just like the one he's called you and me to.
[time=1455] So important that you understand that.
[time=1457] What God's calling Jonah to is the very same thing God has called you to.
[time=1462] So let's look at this story of a man just like us and a God who called him on a mission exactly like the mission God has called you to.
[time=1470] We'll read a little and then we'll talk about it and then we're going to read a little bit more
[time=1476] and then we're going to keep discussing it and we're going to just make our way through these chapters and hope and pray that God will grow us and change us to be the people he's called us to be.
[time=1487] Let's start with Jonah chapter 1.
[time=1490] Jonah chapter 1 verses 1 to 3, open your Bibles, open up your tablets, get your phone out.
[time=1497] However it is, you're going to view the Scriptures this morning and would you, in honor of God's Word, understand and let me read this to you this morning as we begin.
[time=1507] It says in Jonah 1 1, it says the Word of the Lord came to Jonah, the son of Amatized, saying,
[time=1515] saying, "Arise, arise Jonah, go to Nineveh, the great city and cry against it."
[time=1523] For their wickedness has come up before me.
[time=1526] To cry against it is God instructing Jonah the prophet to go and call that place to repentance.
[time=1534] To call that place to change their ways, to confess their sin and turn their hearts and their souls to God.
[time=1542] Arising, go to Nineveh, the great city and cry against it.
[time=1546] For their wickedness has come up before me, but Jonah verse 3 rose up to flee, to tarshish,
[time=1554] from the presence of the Lord.
[time=1556] So he went down to Japa, found a ship which was going to tarshish, paid the fare,
[time=1563] and went down into it to the ship to go with them to tarshish away from the presence of the Lord.
[time=1573] God said, "Go to Nineveh." And just like it says in the Jesus story book Bible, I don't know how many of you have read the story of Jonah
[time=1585] in the Jesus story book Bible, but he goes and remember he buys a ticket to not Nineveh.
[time=1595] He buys a ticket to not Nineveh, not going, where you want me to go.
[time=1605] Not going to do what you want me to do.
[time=1610] Let's pray.
[time=1611] God, I hope and have been praying all week and God we again pray this morning that you will do.
[time=1618] A special thing with your word, that the Word of God today will be, as it says it is, alive and active,
[time=1627] cutting, penetrating, moving deep into our hearts and souls and lives at the very place where we live
[time=1635] and think God, would you do a transforming work in each and every one of us at whatever level work needs to be done.
[time=1644] Oh God, with the Scriptures this morning, do that very work we pray in your son's name.
[time=1649] And everybody agreed and said, "Amen, you can have a seat."
[time=1655] Hey, first of all out of the gate right here, I want to just make a point.
[time=1658] It's a pretty simple point, but I think it's profound and worth making.
[time=1662] You can write this down if you'd like and I'll explain it to you here in a minute.
[time=1665] Jonah was a prophet.
[time=1667] I don't want you to forget this.
[time=1669] I want to make sure that you recognize this.
[time=1672] Jonah was a prophet.
[time=1674] He was a prophet of God.
[time=1676] I want to make this clear.
[time=1678] Most of you here today know the basic storyline of Jonah.
[time=1682] I went around the room and asked you, "Hey, what's the story we're about to hear?" Many of you could sort of articulate how this thing unfolds and where this thing goes.
[time=1693] And I want to remind you this morning that Jonah was a prophet.
[time=1697] Jonah was a man of God.
[time=1702] Jonah was a spokesman for God himself.
[time=1706] Jonah was a spiritual leader.
[time=1710] The word of the Lord doesn't just come to anybody.
[time=1713] No, the word of the Lord came to those who were established.
[time=1716] This guy was something.
[time=1718] He was a spokesman for God.
[time=1720] He's a spiritual leader.
[time=1723] He's a respected ambassador for God.
[time=1727] You with me?
[time=1729] And he blows it.
[time=1734] Oh, he just blows it.
[time=1738] And he's, quite frankly, he's pathetic.
[time=1743] What we see him do, what we see him choose the way he functions.
[time=1746] It's just absolutely horrible.
[time=1748] In this case, he's selfish.
[time=1750] He's not about the kingdom.
[time=1752] He's about himself.
[time=1753] He's short-sighted.
[time=1755] He's contemptible and filled with prejudice.
[time=1759] This man of God.
[time=1761] I say this to you just to remind you.
[time=1764] To remind those of you in the room this morning, those of you who might be watching online, I want to just remind you, even the man of God can get sideways at times.
[time=1777] Better said, even those who know better, right?
[time=1782] Even those who know better can at times lose their way.
[time=1786] And I want you to be reminded this morning that God notices this.
[time=1791] When the one who knows better, when the man of God, when the woman of God, when the one who in many people's eyes is supposed to be all this, when they're not all that.
[time=1804] And when their own struggles or their own weaknesses or their own trials lead them to this place
[time=1810] of wandering, God notices.
[time=1812] Jonah, listen, Jonah is about a lot of things.
[time=1816] It really is, not the least of which is that while God does go to great lengths to reach
[time=1823] those who are far from him, Nineveh.
[time=1828] Jonah's about a lot of things, not the least of which is that while God does go to great lengths to reach those who are far from him, Nineveh, he goes even further at times.
[time=1845] Giant fish, swallowing a man, he goes even further at times to bring back those who are
[time=1855] his, who wander and struggle and aren't what they know in their hearts they should be.
[time=1864] So I just want to make sure you see this.
[time=1867] He was a prophet.
[time=1869] He was supposed to be this, but he wasn't.
[time=1871] And God goes to great lengths to bring him back.
[time=1874] Second thing I want you to see is the real message of the book of Jonah.
[time=1879] And again, I just would invite you to write this down.
[time=1881] I want you to see the real message as we start, the real underlying theme of the book of Jonah,
[time=1887] which is reaching those far from God.
[time=1891] It's a number of themes, but one of the main themes I want you to know this up front is reaching those who are far from God.
[time=1900] Because the truth is the book of Jonah is about Jonah.
[time=1903] It is about Jonah and Nineveh.
[time=1907] It is about a prophet and an evil people in a place called Assyria.
[time=1915] But it's also, and I want to make sure you catch this, it's also about Israel.
[time=1920] The book of Jonah is also about Israel and the nations.
[time=1926] I hope you'll write that down.
[time=1928] It's about Israel and the nations.
[time=1930] And whenever, please don't miss this.
[time=1932] Whenever God in the Bible makes an example of Israel.
[time=1935] Whenever God highlights something Israel wasn't doing, you should listen.
[time=1940] Because whatever Israel's botching, whatever Israel's blowing, whatever Israel's not getting right,
[time=1947] and we see this so many times in the Old Testament, whatever we see God drawing attention to, as it relates to Israel's failure, he's showing you that because he wants the church to get it right.
[time=1961] And who's the church?
[time=1963] You.
[time=1964] You're the church.
[time=1965] I'm the church.
[time=1966] We're the church.
[time=1967] Whenever we see an example of Israel.
[time=1970] Get your antenna up, get your pen ready because there's some things that God wants you to see, and we're going to come back to this in just a minute.
[time=1978] Verse 2, "Arise," he says.
[time=1981] "Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me."
[time=1988] All my friends, Nineveh was a godless place.
[time=1991] It really was.
[time=1992] Nineveh was an evil community.
[time=1994] It was for years the Assyrian capital located 500 miles to the northeast of Israel,
[time=2001] and it was known for a level of evil, a level of hostility, a level of cruelty,
[time=2009] a level of debauchery and heartlessness never before seen.
[time=2014] In the then-known world, at that time, it was the worst of the worst.
[time=2020] I came across some notes in my study over the last couple of weeks.
[time=2025] I've tried to condense it a little bit.
[time=2029] Believe me, in my condensing of these notes, it's PG-13.
[time=2038] Wouldn't have even dreamed of reading to you out loud all of what I found.
[time=2044] As you find in history the descriptions of Nineveh,
[time=2050] the Assyrian kings were proud of their cruel and terrible reputation,
[time=2057] and they went to great trouble and expense to record their heinous exploits for posterity sake.
[time=2066] Assyrians boasted often of their cruelty to captured peoples following the siege of their town or city,
[time=2074] and their victims were not limited to merely the combatants.
[time=2080] Records found over the years brag of live dismemberment.
[time=2086] Live dismemberment, often leaving one hand attached so they could shake it before the person died.
[time=2095] They made parades.
[time=2098] They would hold parades of heads requiring friends or family members of the deceased to carry them elevated on poles.
[time=2108] They boasted of their practice of stretching live prisoners with ropes so they could be skinned alive while being stretched.
[time=2117] The human skins were then displayed on city walls and on poles throughout the community.
[time=2123] They commissioned artists to come and paint pictures of their post-battle tortures
[time=2131] while piles of heads, hands and feet, and heads impaled on poles.
[time=2137] Eight heads to a stake would be openly displayed.
[time=2142] They pulled out the tongues of live victims and burned the young alive.
[time=2146] Tens of thousands in hundreds and hundreds of cities suffered this fate over the 250 years of the Assyrians' reign of terror and pain.
[time=2163] Now watch this.
[time=2165] Some of those impaled heads were Israelites.
[time=2171] Some of the tortured were Jews.
[time=2176] Some of the young that were murdered.
[time=2179] Jonah may have known their families.
[time=2183] So you're Jonah.
[time=2187] And God says to you, go offer them my mercy.
[time=2195] You're Jonah and those are your friends.
[time=2199] You're Jonah and this is the reality of the world you live in.
[time=2202] The most heinous, awful, evil thing going.
[time=2205] And God says to you, go and offer them my grace.
[time=2210] Go give them a chance to have all their heinous, evil forgiven.
[time=2216] How would you feel?
[time=2221] He didn't want to go.
[time=2225] And I think that there are big picture national allegiance issues.
[time=2233] But I think, do you think he might have been scared?
[time=2237] Anybody?
[time=2238] You think he might have been scared to walk into the gates of Nineveh and tell them all they're going to hell?
[time=2246] To come to Jesus?
[time=2249] You think what he knew? Realizing what was going on in that place, sure he was.
[time=2254] He was scared to death, but he was also bitter.
[time=2260] His heart had clearly gotten hard.
[time=2266] His redemptive spirit, when we say redemptive spirit around here, we're talking about that spirit in people that wants to see others come to faith in Christ.
[time=2274] His redemptive spirit had faded.
[time=2278] He's supposed to help people as a prophet of God, he's supposed to help people find God, and he's running the other way.
[time=2286] And just so you know, this is where Israel comes in.
[time=2291] I told you about that a few minutes ago, let's come back to that.
[time=2293] This is where Israel comes in.
[time=2296] God often does this in the Old Testament especially.
[time=2300] He makes an example.
[time=2302] God tells a story, he brings us to a real life example that has application on its own,
[time=2310] but it is an illustration of Israel.
[time=2313] Example for you, do you remember in the past we've told you about the story of Hosea?
[time=2319] Raise your hand if you remember Hosea.
[time=2321] Hosea good, was a prophet of God.
[time=2324] And in God's story with Hosea, God calls Hosea, not to go to Nineveh,
[time=2330] God calls Hosea to marry a harlot named, anybody?
[time=2337] Gomer.
[time=2338] God says to Hosea, marry a harlot named Gomer, and oh by the way she's not going to stop
[time=2344] harloting, she'll keep harloting and I want you to keep loving her.
[time=2352] And so while that was a true story, in that story for Israel, God wants to make an example
[time=2358] of how faithful God is and how faithful they should be, they weren't being very faithful, and so God uses this example.
[time=2365] You with me?
[time=2366] Not your heads?
[time=2367] All right, good.
[time=2369] Jonah, same thing.
[time=2372] God told, look in your Bibles, go back to, well we could go a lot of places here,
[time=2379] but I want you to go back to Exodus, go back on your phone or on your tablet or in your Bible, go back to the beginning here, back toward the beginning, go to Exodus 19, would you?
[time=2389] I want you to see from the very beginning what God had in mind for the people of Israel.
[time=2394] What was God's redemptive plan?
[time=2396] How was God going to move his kingdom forward?
[time=2399] What was it that God had prescribed?
[time=2402] What was the role that the Israelites were to have in moving the good news of the kingdom
[time=2408] forward?
[time=2409] Well here it is, here's one of the places where we would find that, Exodus 19 verse 5.
[time=2414] Now he said then, if you will indeed, he's talking to Moses once Moses to pass this along
[time=2420] to the people.
[time=2421] Now then if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own
[time=2428] possession among all the peoples, among all the nations, you're going to be mine.
[time=2433] For all the earth is mine and you shall be to me, here it is, and you shall be to me a kingdom
[time=2439] of what?
[time=2440] Say it, Church.
[time=2441] Say it louder.
[time=2443] We've talked about priests before, priests were those who represented God.
[time=2448] Priests are those who pass along to others.
[time=2451] The attributes of God, a priest is one who conveys the love of God and the truth of God and the grace of God and the goodness of God.
[time=2459] And God's designed from the very beginning with the nation of Israel is that they would be his own kingdom of priests who would live life and be completely consumed with themselves.
[time=2472] No.
[time=2473] They were to live life and be completely consumed with bringing the kingdom of God to the nations.
[time=2483] They weren't, they weren't being priests.
[time=2490] They weren't reaching the nations.
[time=2493] They were grumbling and they were complaining and they were whining and they were disobeying.
[time=2500] It wasn't going well at all on the Israel, kingdom of God moving forward front.
[time=2505] And so Jonah, so the story of Jonah unfolds and we see in the story of Jonah this application
[time=2512] for the people of Israel, here's the bottom line, listen, here's the bottom line for this
[time=2518] application for Israel and the story of Jonah, Israel's asleep in the bottom of the boat.
[time=2527] You with me?
[time=2530] Israel's asleep in the bottom of the boat headed to not Nineveh.
[time=2537] God had said to Israel, go and they said, no, we don't think we will.
[time=2545] God says to Jonah, go and Jonah says, nah, I don't think so.
[time=2550] I think I'm going to go to Tarsheesh, going to get a ticket to not Nineveh.
[time=2555] And so here's the deal.
[time=2558] If I'm Jonah and I am, if you're Jonah and I believe you are, I believe that you and
[time=2572] I share many of the same characteristics of Jonah.
[time=2576] I believe that we're stubborn.
[time=2579] I believe there's things that God has called us to that we want no part of.
[time=2584] I believe that we're fearful, I believe we even have prejudice in us.
[time=2588] I believe that there are callings that God brings to your life and mind and we resist
[time=2594] it.
[time=2595] I believe that you argue with God.
[time=2596] I think I question God.
[time=2598] I believe that we are a bunch of Jonah's.
[time=2605] And if that's true, if you're Jonah, then I want to make sure this morning that you give some thought to this, then you have a Nineveh.
[time=2617] What's who's your, what's your Nineveh?
[time=2626] And we want you to think about this this morning.
[time=2631] I'd invite you to write some names down.
[time=2635] I'd invite you to write down some, some circumstances.
[time=2641] Maybe it's a he, maybe it's a she, maybe it's a them.
[time=2647] But I think you've got a Nineveh, somebody in your world who needs God's grace.
[time=2654] Somebody in your world who needs to be redeemed, to be redeemed means to be made, what, to be made new.
[time=2661] There's somebody out there and you know who they are.
[time=2665] And you've known them for six months, you've known them for six years, you've known them for 30 years.
[time=2670] And you know as well as I know that sitting here this morning, the Spirit of God is reaching into your heart right now and He's convicting you and He's saying to you, "Hey, this isn't
[time=2681] going to go away.
[time=2682] They need me and I need you to go and help."
[time=2689] But you keep punching your ticket to not Nineveh.
[time=2697] Someone evil, someone difficult, someone hard, who is it?
[time=2705] And I know, I know you don't want to go, but you're a priest.
[time=2711] Here's where we have to just reconcile this.
[time=2715] If you've fully surrendered your heart and life to Christ, if you're in on this with us, if we're part of this family of God and this kingdom moving forward, you are a priest
[time=2727] of the Most High God.
[time=2729] It doesn't matter where you get your paycheck.
[time=2731] Don't look at me like, "I've got this wrong.
[time=2733] I don't.
[time=2734] You're a priest.
[time=2735] I'm a priest." You're to represent Him.
[time=2738] You're to pass along His attributes to that very person in your very world with whatever challenges might be there.
[time=2748] You're a New Testament prophet.
[time=2751] You're a spokesman for God and your calling is no different than Jonas and you're hiding.
[time=2759] You're sleeping.
[time=2761] Do you ever notice how sometimes we sleep, literally, when we should be not sleeping?
[time=2772] Do you ever notice how sometimes we step back into passivity when we should be stepping forward into action?
[time=2780] You're hiding.
[time=2782] And in verse 4 through 17, we see what happens.
[time=2787] We see where the hiding leads to.
[time=2790] I've been looking forward to this all week, I just want to read this to you.
[time=2794] "And the Lord hurled a great wind." He gets on his boat, all right, off to Tarsheesh.
[time=2799] He goes.
[time=2800] "Lord hurled a great wind on the sea and there was a great storm on the sea so that the ship was about to break up, and then the sailors became afraid, and every man, this is interesting, cried to his God.
[time=2812] Is God in your Bible or on your tablet there?
[time=2814] Is that God their capital G or small G, say it?
[time=2818] Small G.
[time=2819] So the sailors get all afraid and they freak out, they cry to their God, little G, and they threw the cargo which was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them.
[time=2827] But Jonah had gone below into the hold of the ship, laid down, and had fallen asleep.
[time=2834] So the captain approached him and said, "How is it that you're sleeping?
[time=2837] Hey, get up, call on your God." He didn't know really who he was.
[time=2842] They were all just calling on their gods, right?
[time=2845] Multiple plurals.
[time=2847] Call on your little G God.
[time=2851] Perhaps your little G God will be concerned about us so that we won't perish.
[time=2855] Each man said to his mate, "Come.
[time=2857] Let us cast lots so we may learn on whose account this calamity has struck us."
[time=2863] So they cast lots and the lot fell on who, say it?
[time=2867] Jonah.
[time=2868] Then they said to Jonah, "Tell us now." I mean, this ship's cracking apart.
[time=2874] Tell us now on whose account has this calamity struck us.
[time=2879] What is your occupation?
[time=2881] And where do you come from?
[time=2883] What is your country?
[time=2884] From what people are you?
[time=2886] And he said, he lays it out right here in nine.
[time=2888] He said to them, "I am a Hebrew.
[time=2890] I'm an Israelite, and I fear the Lord God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land."
[time=2899] Interesting.
[time=2900] Verse 10, "Then the men became extremely." They were frightened.
[time=2904] Now they become extremely frightened, and they said to him, "How could you do this?"
[time=2912] Because, and don't miss this, because everybody, pretty much, when you get right down to it,
[time=2925] and everything's on the line, everybody knows about God, don't they?
[time=2934] All they want to make you think they don't, and in the normal day to day of this debate
[time=2940] or that debate, you know, they're going to hang on to day.
[time=2945] When everything's on the line, and you're staring death in the face, isn't it interesting?
[time=2950] Now they're really frightened, because now the God of God is ticked.
[time=2956] Amen?
[time=2960] How could you do this for the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them so they said to him, "What should we do to you that the sea may become calm for us, for the sea was becoming increasingly stormy." He said to them, "Pit me up and throw me into the sea." He's done.
[time=2977] He's at the end of his rope, he knows he's messed up, he knows this thing cannot end while throw me over.
[time=2982] He said, "The sea will become calm for you, for I know that on account of me, this great
[time=2990] storm has come upon you." Now these are good dudes.
[time=2993] They don't want to throw them overboard, however the men rode, now they rode desperately to return to land, but they could not, for the sea was becoming even stormier against them.
[time=3004] Then they called on the Lord and said, "We earnestly pray, O Lord, do not let us perish
[time=3011] on account of this man's life, and do not put innocent blood on us, for you, O Lord,
[time=3018] have done as you pleased." Just a few verses ago, they're crying out to their little G God, and now a few verses later they're on their faces, crying out to the one God who they know is in control.
[time=3032] So they picked up Jonah 15 and threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped, it's raging.
[time=3039] Then the men feared the Lord greatly, and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows.
[time=3047] They made commitments to God.
[time=3050] Just a quick little side note there, don't forget that while God's going to deal with you and me in our wandering, don't forget that while God may have some things for us
[time=3061] to figure out, as He deals with you and as He deals with me, oftentimes even in our wandering
[time=3070] God's at work to bring others to Himself.
[time=3074] Did you see that?
[time=3076] What an amazing picture.
[time=3077] And then here it is, verse 17, "These in the water, down He goes, and the Lord appointed
[time=3084] a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the stomach of the fish three days and
[time=3092] three nights." So what's the moral of the story?
[time=3100] Jonah, Israel, you.
[time=3110] What's the takeaway here?
[time=3114] You know what the takeaway is, I was thinking about it last night, I told the first hour.
[time=3123] The takeaway is, kind of in the spirit of the direct TV commercial, don't get swallowed
[time=3130] by a giant fish.
[time=3135] You know that commercial?
[time=3139] Don't get, don't run away, don't run away, don't argue, don't go to Japa and hop on
[time=3149] a boat to not Nineveh, don't do all of that because none of that works and you end up
[time=3155] getting swallowed by a fish, don't end up getting swallowed by a fish, go to where?
[time=3165] Nineveh.
[time=3168] Who's your Nineveh?
[time=3175] Where is it that God has called you to go?
[time=3178] Who is it that God has called you to reach out to?
[time=3183] I'm gonna ask the band to come back up and we're gonna have the privilege this morning
[time=3189] of responding to this great truth.
[time=3192] I hope with just great heartfelt worship.
[time=3198] I hope that as you think about this, I hope even now that you're realizing that next week is gonna be really interesting.
[time=3205] What goes on in the belly of a fish?
[time=3207] What goes on in one's heart and mind when finally God has gotten their attention?
[time=3214] When finally it's time to deal with God and your stubbornness and your waywardness.
[time=3220] I hope you'll read it all week long.
[time=3223] I hope you'll be back next week as we study this more together.
[time=3227] Adam, team would you lead us in worship?
[time=3229] Would you stand and let's sing in spirit and in truth?
[time=3241] You are good, you are good, when there's nothing good in me.
[time=3247] You are love, you are love, on display for all to see.
[time=3253] You are light, you are light, when the darkness closes in.
[time=3259] You are hope, you are hope, you have covered all my sin.
[time=3271] You are peace, you are peace, when I fear it's crippling.
[time=3282] You are true, you are true, even in my wandering.
[time=3288] You are joy, you are joy, you're the reason that I sing.
[time=3294] You are life, you are life, and you death that's lost its sting.
[time=3304] And oh, I'm running to your arms, I'm running to your arms, the riches of your love will
[time=3317] always be enough, nothing compares to your embrace, light of the world forever in.
[time=3331] And you are more, you are more than my words will ever say.
[time=3341] You are Lord, you are Lord, all creation will book a name.
[time=3347] You are give, you are give, in your presence I may hold you.
[time=3353] You are God, you are God, of all else I'm letting go.
[time=3365] And oh, I'm running to your arms, I'm running to your arms, the riches of your love will
[time=3376] always be enough, nothing compares to your embrace, light of the world forever in.
[time=3391] I'm running to your arms, I'm running to your arms, the riches of your love will always
[time=3401] be enough, nothing compares to your embrace, light of the world forever in.
[time=3416] My heart will sing, no other name, Jesus, Jesus, my heart will sing, no other name, Jesus,
[time=3462] Jesus, Jesus, Oh, I'm running to your arms, I'm running to your arms, the riches of
[time=3482] your love will always be enough, nothing compares to your embrace, light of the world forever
[time=3499] in, no other name, Jesus, I'm running to your arms, the riches of your love will always
[time=3512] be enough, nothing compares to your embrace, light of the world forever in.
[time=3529] .
