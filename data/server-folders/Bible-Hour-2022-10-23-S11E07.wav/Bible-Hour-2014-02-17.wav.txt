[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] Well, good morning, everybody, don't adjust your TV sets.
[time=36] My name is Steve Webster, I'm not Kelly Burr, but I do serve on the team here at Black Hawk Ministries as a teaching pastor.
[time=43] It's a great privilege to do so.
[time=45] I'm here this morning to talk to you about a couple of things.
[time=48] And my responsibilities here at Black Hawk Ministries, Black Equinistries of Choruses, Black Hawk Church, Black Hawk Christian School and the Bible Hour, thus the Ministries.
[time=59] But Black Hawk Christian School is in their ongoing re-enrollment process right now.
[time=65] There's a sign out in front of our building on state boulevard giving you instructions about that.
[time=70] You can go to blackhawkChristian.org to get more information.
[time=74] I've served at the school as a teacher now for, this is my 11th year.
[time=78] And I couldn't be prouder and more excited about the direction that our school is heading.
[time=82] Not only in the days right now, but in the days to come as well.
[time=86] Never a better time to jump in and get involved and get more information.
[time=90] Call us at 493-7470 to get more information.
[time=95] We'd be happy to walk you through the process of taking a tour or coming to visit one of the classrooms or whatever you'd like.
[time=101] The school has been functioning and serving families in Fort Wayne for 40 years.
[time=106] And I could not be prouder to be a part of that team of people serving the Lord faithfully together.
[time=112] I've only got two classes now at the school. I've changed over to serve more on the church side and exciting days for me as well.
[time=119] But I can tell you that the school is thriving. It's been a great school year.
[time=123] We're going to be in school a little bit longer because of the snow and ice and all the rest of it this year.
[time=128] But that's like everybody else. So grateful for the chance that we have at the school to serve families again here in Fort Wayne.
[time=135] This morning you're going to hear again from us on Jonah and Jonah is like me.
[time=142] He's a muddle. It's the good. It's the bad. It's the ugly.
[time=146] Jonah had kind of a bad chapter one. He's going to have a pretty good chapter two.
[time=151] So I'm grateful that you're with us here on our IM Jonah series going to be lasting for a couple more weeks.
[time=157] I'll be sharing this morning and I'm very excited to talk about Jonah's prayers from the deep.
[time=162] His desire to cry out to God in his trouble and his distress.
[time=167] Thanks for tuning in. As always we hope to see you here soon and please call us if we can help in any way.
[time=192] Have a broken. You hear the cry of the broken. You hear the cry of the broken.
[time=209] Yes you do Lord. You hear the cry of the broken.
[time=218] You hear the cry of the broken. You hear the cry of the broken.
[time=254] And you answer. You answer the cry of the broken. You answer the cry of the broken.
[time=268] You answer the cry of the broken. Your name is a stronger mighty tower of your name.
[time=288] It's a shelter like the world of your name. Have the nations sing louder.
[time=297] It's nothing as the power to sing. Your name is a stronger mighty tower of your name.
[time=311] It's a shelter like the world of your name. Have the nations sing louder.
[time=319] It's nothing as the power to sing. Your name.
[time=359] What's your name again if you leave out today?
[time=369] Amen. Thank you for singing today. Thank you for praising him in this house.
[time=377] You call me out upon the waters. The great I know will feed my faith.
[time=392] And verify you in the mystery. In oceans deep, my faith will stand.
[time=407] And I will call upon your name. And keep my eyes above the wings.
[time=421] When oceans rise, my soul will rest in your embrace. For I am yours, and you are mine.
[time=450] Your grace abounds in deepest waters. Your sovereign hand will be my guide.
[time=464] Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me. You've never failed, and you won't start now.
[time=479] And I will call upon your name. And keep my eyes above the wings.
[time=492] When oceans rise, my soul will rest in your embrace. For I am yours, and you are mine.
[time=520] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=534] Spirit leave me where my trust is without borders. Let me walk upon the waters, wherever you would call me.
[time=549] Take me deeper than my faith could ever wonder. And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Savior.
[time=565] Spirit leave me where my trust is without borders. Let me walk upon the waters, wherever you would call me.
[time=578] Take me deeper than my faith could ever wonder. And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Savior.
[time=594] Spirit leave me where my trust is without borders. Let me walk upon the waters, wherever you would call me.
[time=608] Take me deeper than my faith could ever wonder. And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Savior.
[time=623] Spirit leave me where my trust is without borders. Let me walk upon the waters, wherever you would call me.
[time=637] Take me deeper than my faith could ever wonder. And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Savior.
[time=652] And take me deeper than my faith could ever wonder. And take me deeper than my faith could ever wonder.
[time=672] For I am yours, and you are mine.
[time=684] We will be reading from Jonah chapters 1 and 2. The Lord gave this message to Jonah, some of Amatai.
[time=697] Get up and go to the great city of Nineveh. Announce my judgment against it because I have seen how wicked its people are.
[time=704] But Jonah got up and went the opposite direction to get away from the Lord. He went down to the poor of Jelba where he found a ship leaving for Tarshish.
[time=712] He brought a tick and went on board, hoping to escape from the Lord by sailing to Tarshish.
[time=718] But the Lord hurled a powerful wind over the sea, causing a violent storm that threatened to break the ship apart.
[time=724] Fearing for their lives, the desperate sailors shouted to their gods for help and through cargo overboard to lighten the ship.
[time=732] But all this time, Jonah was sound asleep down in the hold.
[time=735] So the captain went down after him. "How can you sleep at a time like this?" he shouted.
[time=740] "Get up and pray to your God. Maybe he will pay attention to us and spare our lives."
[time=747] Then the crew cast lots to see which of them had offended the gods and caused the terrible storm.
[time=753] When they did this, the lots identified Jonah as the culprit.
[time=757] "Why has this awful storm come down on us?" they demanded.
[time=760] "Who are you? What is your line of work? What country are you from? What is your nationality?" Jonah answered. "I am a Hebrew and I worship the Lord of God of Heaven who made the sea in the land."
[time=772] The sailors were terrified when they heard this, for he had already told him that Hebrews running away from the Lord.
[time=778] "Oh, why did you do it?" they groaned. And since the storm was getting worse all the time, they asked him, "What should we do to you to stop the storm?" "Throw me into the sea," Jonah said, and it will become calm again.
[time=788] "I know that this terrible storm is all my fault." Instead, the sailors rode even harder to get the ship to land, but the stormy sea was too violent for them and they couldn't make it.
[time=798] Then they cried out to the Lord, Jonah's God. "O Lord," they pleaded. "Don't make us die for this man's sin, and don't hold us responsible for his death."
[time=807] "O Lord, you have sent this storm upon him for your own good reason." Then the sailors picked up Jonah and threw him into the raging sea, and the storm stops at once.
[time=818] The sailors were awestruck by the Lord's great power and they offered him a sacrifice and vowed to serve him.
[time=824] Now the Lord had arranged for a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights.
[time=830] Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from inside the fish. He said, "I cried out to the Lord in my great trouble, and he answered me.
[time=837] I called to you from the land of the dead, and Lord, you heard me." "You threw me into the ocean depths, and I sank down to the heart of the sea. The mighty waters engulfed me.
[time=847] I was buried beneath your wild and stormy waves." Then I said, "O Lord, you have driven me from your presence, yet I will look once more toward your holy temple."
[time=856] "I sank beneath the waves, and the waters closed over me. See we'd wrapped itself around my head."
[time=862] "I sank down to the very roots of the mountains. I was imprisoned in the earth whose gates locked shut forever.
[time=869] But you, O Lord my God, snatched me from the jaws of death." "As my life was slipping away, I remembered the Lord, and my earnest prayer went out to you in the Holy Temple."
[time=879] "Those who worship false gods turn their backs on all God's mercies. But I will offer sacrifices to you with songs of praise.
[time=886] And I will fulfill all my vows, for my salvation comes from the Lord alone." Then the Lord ordered the fish to spread Jonah out onto the beach." Would you all thank Laurel and Jake for reading with us this morning?
[time=904] Thanks, guys. That's only the first half of the story, but what an amazing story.
[time=912] What a muddle Jonah is. He's just so messed up like me.
[time=918] I'm going to pray as we start, I love it if you would join me this morning as we begin.
[time=925] Would you pray with me?
[time=931] Father, I didn't ask Jonathan and the band to play that song this morning.
[time=940] Your grace abounds in deepest waters.
[time=949] That's the place we need it most, God.
[time=954] I don't know how these dear folks came to be in this room. Today God, they came to tune in on the broadcast or online.
[time=965] I don't know how they came to be watching or to be here, but I know that wherever they are and however they got here, that you're good.
[time=976] And that you are a gracious, a merciful and compassionate God, our very present health in times of trouble.
[time=990] It's like whatever our trouble is this morning, whatever trouble we brought with us, I pray that this morning would be a safe place for us to struggle.
[time=999] A safe place for us to cry out to you and to say, "Oh, God, have mercy on me."
[time=1006] So God, meet us not where we should be, not where we once were.
[time=1011] Would you meet us today where we are?
[time=1014] Thank you that your sovereign hand as the song says will be our guide.
[time=1019] What a comfort. What a marvelous, marvelous comfort.
[time=1024] We pray these things to you, Father, from our hearts with great thanksgiving for what you're going to do in our time together.
[time=1032] And we ask all this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1037] If you have your Bibles, we're going to be in Jonah not only this week, but in the couple weeks to come after this.
[time=1044] We're going to work through this story.
[time=1046] I got to listen to Kelly's sermon from last week, for the first time all the way through yesterday.
[time=1053] I was not here last week. I was with some dear friends out at Miriam Christian Chapel.
[time=1058] And I was overwhelmed by what Kelly said. He hit a home run, to be sure.
[time=1065] This is a really strange little story that almost everybody has some idea about.
[time=1072] Sailors today still talk about someone being a Jonah who maybe have brought bad luck on their journey.
[time=1079] So it's a story that a lot of people know, but there's so much going on here that I can't wait to talk to you about today.
[time=1087] I kind of feel like I prayed a minute ago, like church oftentimes is made out to be a place.
[time=1095] We're going to church, and it's not true.
[time=1098] Church is people. People are the church. You are the church.
[time=1103] And a lot of people don't feel safe coming through those doors to ask, doesn't feel safe to ask questions, to struggle.
[time=1113] And maybe Jonah didn't seem that way to you as you read it the first time, but I really feel like Jonah is that story.
[time=1121] Jonah is just a whole jumble of triumph and tragedy of the good, the bad, the ugly of all of it.
[time=1129] He's like me. He's like you. He has all these things that confront him and that he doesn't know how to make sense of all of it, what to do even.
[time=1139] If you have your Bibles and you have them open to Jonah, go back to chapter 1 with me real quick.
[time=1145] The headings in my Bible for Jonah 1 read this way.
[time=1149] Jonah flees the presence of the Lord. So watch this.
[time=1152] He flees the presence of the Lord. He's thrown into the sea, and he's a great fish swallows Jonah.
[time=1159] So Jonah did not have a very good day to put it very plainly with you this morning.
[time=1165] He had a very bad day to quote the children's book. He had a no good, very bad day.
[time=1171] Why did Jonah have a no good, very bad day? Look at verse 3 of chapter 1. Would you please?
[time=1180] Before we get to verse 3, God says to Jonah, Jonah, would you go and cry out to these people living in Nineveh?
[time=1189] And we learn, of course, that he doesn't want to. And Kelly, last week, told you why he doesn't want to.
[time=1195] He doesn't want to because these are not nice people. In fact, they are the terribleest people in the ancient world.
[time=1202] And go back and listen again to what Kelly said, but it is not pretty.
[time=1208] The Assyrians invented all kinds of methods of torture.
[time=1213] They were terrorists. They marauded over the ancient world, destroying, pillaging as they went.
[time=1220] They invented what became crucifixion, and they're despicable people.
[time=1226] So Jonah has this well-informed prejudice against them. He doesn't want to go. God says go. He goes, "No, I don't want to go."
[time=1233] Like Kelly said, last week from the Jesus storybook Bible, one ticket to not Nineveh, please.
[time=1238] That's where he heads. He heads in the opposite direction.
[time=1242] Look at verse three. So Jonah makes all these decisions that are not very good, but why? That's why.
[time=1250] Verse three of chapter one, Jonah rose. Watch all the verbs in this verse.
[time=1256] Jonah rose to flee to Tarshes from the presence of the Lord. He went down to Japa. He found a ship going to Tarshes.
[time=1262] He paid the fare, went on board to go with him to Tarshes away from the presence of the Lord.
[time=1268] He doesn't just have like a whoopsie. He trips over like, "Whoop, sorry. My bad." It's like six or seven really bad choices after one after the other that lead him into his predicament.
[time=1282] I think we could have told this, we didn't tell this series this way, but we could have told this series very easily, really.
[time=1288] Jonah, really? Because one reason, as you'll find out, one reason why Jonah goes the opposite direction from Nineveh
[time=1296] is because he's so confident that if he goes to Nineveh, they're going to listen to what he says and cry to God and be saved.
[time=1303] And he goes, "I don't want that to happen." So he just obeys God because he's so confident that God's going to act and it's just messed up.
[time=1310] Just like me.
[time=1314] I think we are all prone to forget things that we should remember and remember things that we should forget.
[time=1322] And that's where Jonah is. He is this whole jumble of stuff. He has good ideas. He knows right things.
[time=1331] His actions get in the way quite a bit in this story.
[time=1335] This morning we're going to be in chapter two, and the whole chapter two, virtually all of it, is his prayer from the belly of the fish.
[time=1344] I agree with Kelly from last week that Jonah is a real story. I believe that for lots of reasons that we'll get to this morning in a few minutes.
[time=1352] But if God can do the things that he does in the Scriptures, he can make the Red Sea go like this, right?
[time=1359] He can send these plagues in the mightiest nation of the ancient world.
[time=1364] And I think he can let Jonah live in a fish for three days. This is like that big of a deal. He can figure it out.
[time=1369] If you have a big view of God, then the things that really plague us in the 21st century don't really because God can do whatever he wants, and he does.
[time=1377] So we're going to be in chapter two today and talk about prayers.
[time=1381] The message is entitled "Prares from the Deep" because Jonah is praying to God from this deep, dark, seaweedy place.
[time=1390] It's bad. He's in the belly of a fish down there too. It's not like he's just down there. He's down there in a fish.
[time=1397] Pretty bad. Pretty bad place. He finds himself.
[time=1403] God knows all about these Syrians. He knows what they're about, he knows what they're doing.
[time=1408] And I would just encourage you, this is kind of a PSL press pause for a minute.
[time=1412] Jonah is a minor prophet. It's different than most of the minor prophets because Jonah is a little short story, which is not the way most of the minor prophets read.
[time=1419] There's 12 of them at the end of the Old Testament. Jonah's one of them.
[time=1422] Another one, a few pages to the right, is called Nahum. And Nahum, N-A-H-U-M.
[time=1427] Nahum is the last word on Nineveh.
[time=1431] That God sends Jonah to Nineveh to call them to repent, spoiler alert.
[time=1437] They do repent. Hundred years later, God sends another message to Nineveh, and this time it's not very good.
[time=1445] It's a message of judgment to Nineveh.
[time=1448] So all these reasons that Jonah has to hate them, to run away, to not do what God says, they're good reasons.
[time=1454] But God's heart trumps Jonah's prejudice.
[time=1459] And the heart of God is that God would restore them to right relationship with him, to respond to him rightly,
[time=1467] despite the fact that Jonah has all this anxiety.
[time=1471] Last week, Kelly said, "These people were famous for their brutality, famous for their cruelty, famous for their inhumanity."
[time=1479] And he goes, "No, God. No. I'll go anywhere but there."
[time=1485] And God says, " Jonah, I want you to go and cry out against Nineveh's evil." Isn't like God doesn't know what Nineveh did or doesn't really matter, Jonah?
[time=1494] Because I know what they've done. I know what evil they've committed.
[time=1498] I want you to go and cry out against that evil and call them to turn to me, to repent.
[time=1506] And Jonah has a hard time with that, like we do.
[time=1509] The things in the Bible that I don't understand don't necessarily bother me.
[time=1514] Things in the Bible that I do understand often times bother me.
[time=1518] Jonah's call is very, very clear.
[time=1520] I want you to go Jonah to these people and he goes, "No."
[time=1526] He understands exactly what God's calling him to do and he has a difficult time with it.
[time=1530] Like oftentimes I do.
[time=1532] God tells me very clearly what I should do and I'm like, "Yeah, but if only you knew God, if only you knew what they were like."
[time=1540] He knows what they're like. He knows what you're like. He knows what I'm like.
[time=1545] In your bulletin this morning, there are some notes that invite you to join in with if you'd like to.
[time=1551] And I think Jonah 2 is a prayer that we can get lots of insight from as to how maybe we should pray.
[time=1559] I don't know if you are a praying person this morning.
[time=1562] I don't know why if you're not a praying person, that you're not a praying person.
[time=1566] This morning is an invitation for you to cry out to God.
[time=1572] To cry out to God wherever you are.
[time=1574] If you're down there, if you're sailing on high seas, wherever you are, we need them in those places ever and always.
[time=1583] Let's look at Jonah 2 together this morning.
[time=1588] Jonah 2 verse 1 begins this way, "Then Jonah prayed to the Lord." What's the first word of chapter 2? Say it so we all can hear each other.
[time=1595] What's the first word of chapter 2?
[time=1597] Then he's already been down there for three days and three nights. Then Jonah prays.
[time=1604] Jonah. Really Jonah?
[time=1607] He didn't get to that point sooner.
[time=1610] I think it's easy for me to throw Jonah under the bus, to throw him over the side.
[time=1615] It's easy for me to do that, but I'm just like that.
[time=1618] What took you so long, Steve? It's Wednesday.
[time=1622] Look what happened.
[time=1625] So please be careful. I know it's easy for us to look at Jonah and say, "Really?" Or the disciples? Like those guys walked with Jesus and they don't get it.
[time=1636] He was sitting right in front of them. They didn't understand it.
[time=1639] I just encourage you guys. I don't know that if I was in the boat, I would behave any differently.
[time=1644] Or if I was called to go to Nineveh, if I would behave any differently, be careful about that.
[time=1650] I don't know. I think it's arrogant of us to think that I would have done it differently.
[time=1654] I wouldn't have done that. Just be careful.
[time=1656] Be careful and identify yourself with these people.
[time=1659] God knew what he was doing when he called Jonah. He didn't make mistakes.
[time=1662] Like, "Oh, Jonah, I forgot it." That was a bad choice. Bad choice.
[time=1668] I don't think so.
[time=1671] Chapter 1 ends with Jonah in a very bad place. Look at verse 17 of chapter 1.
[time=1676] I should get there real quick.
[time=1678] It says, "The Lord appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah.
[time=1682] It just so happens. The fish was swimming along at just the right time." So here goes Jonah, right? And the fish is coming along.
[time=1689] It just so happens they intersected.
[time=1692] God has the fish on a joystick.
[time=1696] So what, Steve?
[time=1698] If God has a fish on a joystick, is it too much to believe that he's in control of the circumstances of your life?
[time=1705] I'll repeat myself.
[time=1707] God has the fish on a joystick.
[time=1711] Kids, those were things we used to have back in the day that were for video games.
[time=1717] The old people know what I'm talking about.
[time=1720] He has the fish on remote control.
[time=1723] He's got an app. God's got an app for the fish. Does that help you?
[time=1727] App for the fish to...
[time=1731] If that's true, no.
[time=1733] Since that's true, whatever you're going to face today, whatever you're going to face tomorrow,
[time=1739] he's in control of that too.
[time=1742] He appointed the fish.
[time=1744] The original language says that he had appointed the fish.
[time=1749] So God wasn't scrambling like, "Oh no, Joseph aboard.
[time=1752] Oh goodness, fish going." He knew Jonah was going to be in the water and it already arranged for it to happen.
[time=1760] He's not making it up as he goes.
[time=1764] You can quote me on that.
[time=1766] He was not making it up as he goes.
[time=1768] He had appointed the fish to come and swallow Jonah.
[time=1772] Poor miserable Jonah.
[time=1776] There he is.
[time=1777] Look at verse 1 and chapter 2.
[time=1779] Then Jonah prayed, "Oh Jonah, to Lord his God from the ability of the fish saying, I called out to the Lord out of my distress, Laurel and Jake read from the new living translation
[time=1791] and that it read trouble there." That's the first point in your notes.
[time=1796] There are prayers to God.
[time=1799] We should pray those prayers when we are in trouble.
[time=1805] I think a lot of times, if you're like me, you probably are in some ways.
[time=1812] I feel like when I get into a bad place because I made a mistake or like Jonah, a whole series of bad mistakes.
[time=1819] Well, the God God won't hear you, Steve.
[time=1824] Look at what you did.
[time=1825] It wasn't like you just committed a whipsie.
[time=1827] It was like you did all these terrible, awful things.
[time=1830] And God won't listen to what you have to say.
[time=1832] God won't hear you.
[time=1833] That's a lie.
[time=1836] Do you hear me?
[time=1838] That's a lie.
[time=1839] The enemy tells you to shut you up from prayer.
[time=1842] Jonah cried to God in his distress of his own making.
[time=1848] He says that later on in the prayer.
[time=1850] He says, I know why I'm here.
[time=1851] God put me here because I screwed up.
[time=1856] And you think that when you pray, you can't pray because God won't hear you because you're just a mess.
[time=1861] Jonah is a mess.
[time=1865] He's in big trouble.
[time=1867] It cries out to God.
[time=1869] I want to read you the most encouraging verse I can think of today.
[time=1872] This is from Romans 8, verse 26 about prayer.
[time=1877] Romans 8, verse 26.
[time=1879] Likewise, the spirit helps us in our weakness.
[time=1884] For we do not know what to pray for as we ought.
[time=1889] But the spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.
[time=1894] Can I explain to you what that means?
[time=1896] It means this.
[time=1898] Did I pray all these silly things?
[time=1901] All these things I really probably even shouldn't pray.
[time=1904] And God, the Holy Spirit, intercepts my mumbled prayers and carries them off to the Father what I should have prayed.
[time=1913] So you see, even if you're crying out to God from some deep, dark place, the Holy Spirit knows you better than you know yourself and carries off your prayers to the Father with groanings that you can't even understand.
[time=1928] So you can't mess it up.
[time=1930] You can't do it wrong.
[time=1932] Just cry out to him.
[time=1935] And the Holy Spirit knows you and loves you and cares for you enough to carry off those prayers in a way that you should, that what you should have prayed.
[time=1944] The Lord of course, told the disciples how they should pray.
[time=1947] It really is the disciples' prayer, our Father in heaven, that prayer.
[time=1952] There's a right way to pray in that respect.
[time=1955] I understand that.
[time=1956] But God wants you to cry out to him and you can't do it wrong.
[time=1960] He wants to hear from you.
[time=1961] He knows you.
[time=1962] He knows exactly who you are.
[time=1964] The enemy will lie and say, "Well, God can't hear you." And after what you did, God doesn't hear the prayers of those kind of people.
[time=1975] I'll have ends to the contrary.
[time=1977] He does hear those kind of prayers.
[time=1979] I'm so glad that he does.
[time=1981] The Spirit helps you in your weakness, in your trouble, in your distress.
[time=1987] There's never a wrong time to pray.
[time=1989] Would you write that down?
[time=1991] There's never a wrong time to pray.
[time=1994] If you're memorized Scripture, I hope that you do for so many reasons.
[time=2004] But I offer to you 1 Thessalonians 5, 16 through 18.
[time=2008] Be short verses.
[time=2010] Listen.
[time=2011] "Rejoice always, pray without ceasing; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is the
[time=2019] will of God in Christ Jesus for you." That's the message this morning.
[time=2024] That's Jonah.
[time=2025] "Rejoice always, pray without ceasing." Number two.
[time=2029] Number three.
[time=2030] Give thanks in all circumstances.
[time=2033] You should memorize that.
[time=2034] What does it mean to pray without ceasing, Steve?
[time=2036] Perhaps you're wondering.
[time=2037] I'm glad you asked.
[time=2038] It means this.
[time=2040] The "I should have this constant" doesn't mean that I'm praying all day long.
[time=2044] Like mouthing prayers out all day long.
[time=2046] If you can do that, then by all means, do.
[time=2050] But it means more than that, it means that I have this constant posture of dependence.
[time=2056] That's a great defeater for sin for me in my life.
[time=2062] Is it weird for me to pray right now?
[time=2065] If whatever I'm doing is making it weird to pray, it probably shouldn't be doing it.
[time=2069] Does it help you, pray without ceasing?
[time=2072] It means there's this constant posture of dependence, and there are days that's easy for me and there are days that's hard for me.
[time=2079] I know that you feel like you can't do it.
[time=2082] I know that you feel like you're too messed up for God to love you or to use you, and you're wrong.
[time=2088] Are you there?
[time=2090] You're wrong.
[time=2091] The only kind of people God ever uses are messed up people.
[time=2095] Have you ever read the Bible?
[time=2097] I mean, you name it.
[time=2101] He called David a man after his own heart.
[time=2103] Have you read the story of David?
[time=2106] Moses, God says Moses goes, yeah, I don't know.
[time=2110] I don't know.
[time=2111] Turned out okay for Moses, I think.
[time=2115] Peter, I read the Gospels, I look at Peter, I shake my head.
[time=2120] How could you say that to Jesus?
[time=2125] The only kind of people God uses are messed up people, and maybe you think the church is a museum for shiny, happy people.
[time=2133] It's not.
[time=2134] There are no shiny, happy people, but church should be a hospital for broken people.
[time=2140] Can we work?
[time=2148] Let's work hard on making Black Hawk a place where it's okay to struggle.
[time=2159] We don't oftentimes, so we think that it's, we've got to have all my answers, you know?
[time=2166] I think it's a lot, in a lot of ways, it's more important to have the right questions than the right answers sometimes, I'm sorry.
[time=2175] Second verse three, listen to the pronouns in this verse.
[time=2181] For you cast me into the deep, he isn't just there, God put him there, into the heart of
[time=2188] the seas, the floods surrounded me, all your waves and your billows passed over me.
[time=2196] Even the breakers are God's, those white caps, or his, it's all his.
[time=2202] Then I said, verse four, Jonah says this, I am driven away from your sight.
[time=2210] He knows exactly what he's done, it's not like he's pretending.
[time=2215] He knows he messed up really, really bad.
[time=2218] I am driven away from your sight, maybe yours reads banished or expelled, that's a scary
[time=2225] word, expelled from your sight.
[time=2232] And I shall again look upon your holy temple, again, friends, I, my prayer, my cry, my plea
[time=2240] before God with us is that we would work hard to make this place like Jonah thinks the temple is, a place of comfort, a place where people can come to you for rest and for peace.
[time=2253] I pray that's true, even this morning, even today, especially today, the Psalms, the stuff
[time=2259] that you read in Jonah 2 is all over the Psalms about God being there in distress and trouble.
[time=2266] Look at Psalm 118, verse five, would you?
[time=2271] Psalm 118, verses five, this is one example, and all those references are in your notes so you can go back during the course of the week and read them if you want to.
[time=2279] Psalm 118, verse five, out of my distress, I called on the Lord.
[time=2285] How many times do you have to read it before you believe it?
[time=2290] In your trouble, God is responsive.
[time=2295] Out of my distress, I called on the Lord, the Lord answered me and set me free.
[time=2301] The Lord is on my side, I will not fear.
[time=2303] What can man do to me?
[time=2305] He can throw you over the boat.
[time=2309] That isn't the last for Jonah.
[time=2312] The Lord is on my side as my helper, I shall look in triumph on those who hate me.
[time=2319] This is a great quote from a guy named Andrew Jukes, it's a great name, Andrew Jukes.
[time=2324] He was a 19th century writer.
[time=2328] This is something that he wrote in a letter about his trouble, and I encourage you with it this morning.
[time=2334] All these quotes I'm reading this morning will be in the digging deeper document that we published during the week, so be looking for that online and be encouraged.
[time=2340] We want you to be encouraged by these things, not just now, but throughout the week.
[time=2346] He said this, "I can tell you for an eternal truth that troubled souls are always safe."
[time=2356] Troubled write it down, troubled souls are always safe.
[time=2362] Again, we feel like we come to church, I can't have any problems.
[time=2368] Who are you?
[time=2370] Who is the person that has no problems?
[time=2372] I've never met one.
[time=2373] I know you think that you come in here, dear friend, you come in here and you think that all these people have it all together, I'll raise my hand first.
[time=2381] I don't have it all together.
[time=2383] I know whom I believe, yes, I know whom I believed, and I'm persuaded that he is able
[time=2390] to take that which he's committed until that day.
[time=2393] He can do it.
[time=2394] I can't do it.
[time=2397] We're going to sing God is able in a minute.
[time=2399] I hope you sing it with all your heart.
[time=2401] You know why?
[time=2402] Because you're not, and I'm not.
[time=2409] I can tell you for an eternal truth that troubled souls are always safe.
[time=2412] It is the untroubled that are in danger.
[time=2418] Trouble in itself is always a claim on love, and God is love.
[time=2424] He must deny himself if he doesn't come to help the helpless.
[time=2430] The prisoners, the blind, the leper, the possessed, the hungry, the tempest-tost, who are his special,
[time=2436] they are his special care.
[time=2438] Therefore, if you are lost and sick and bound, you are just in the place where he can meet
[time=2448] you.
[time=2449] If you are lost, if you are sick, if you are bound, you are in just the place where he
[time=2455] can meet you.
[time=2456] Blessed are the mourners.
[time=2457] They shall be comforted.
[time=2462] Take courage, friends.
[time=2463] Do you know that the most frequently given command in the Bible is do not be afraid?
[time=2468] Did you know that?
[time=2472] Don't be afraid.
[time=2474] Don't fear.
[time=2477] Verse 4 of Jonah 2, "He knows what's going on.
[time=2479] I'm driven away from your sight.
[time=2480] I've been banished." God, the temple is a place of strength for him in his trouble.
[time=2486] Verse 5, "The waters closed and over me to take my life." Jonah believes that when he gets to an overboard, that's it.
[time=2492] That's the end.
[time=2493] He's every reason to believe that.
[time=2496] In fact, he thinks because the storm is his fault.
[time=2499] You heard them read that.
[time=2501] He knows it's his fault.
[time=2502] He knows exactly what's going on.
[time=2506] That's going to be it.
[time=2506] The storm is my fault.
[time=2508] I disobeyed God like 18 times.
[time=2511] I'm done, but he's not done.
[time=2515] Takes him three days to figure it out, but he gets there eventually.
[time=2518] God bless him.
[time=2520] The waters closed and over me to take my life.
[time=2522] The deep surrounding me, the weeds were wrapped around my head.
[time=2525] I think Jonah is being a little melodramatic.
[time=2529] That's okay.
[time=2530] At the roots of the mountains, I went down to the land whose bar is closed upon me forever.
[time=2534] Yet you brought up my life from the pit, oh, Lord, my God, I'm going to say something
[time=2540] with you guys.
[time=2541] I want you to repeat it after me.
[time=2542] We've said it before.
[time=2543] It's worth repeating because, again, we all forget things we should remember.
[time=2549] We remember things we should forget.
[time=2553] Don't be like that today.
[time=2555] This is from Isaiah 59, and it says this, it says, "His arm is not too short that he cannot save." Say it with me, "His arm is not too short that it cannot save." One more time.
[time=2568] "His arm is not too short that it cannot save." If he can hear Jonah's prayer, way down there, and, again, he doesn't weigh, he's
[time=2579] down there in a fish, God's got really good sonar.
[time=2586] He hasn't lost track of Jonah.
[time=2587] Oh, Jonah, I forgot about him.
[time=2591] He hasn't forgotten about Jonah.
[time=2593] His arm is not too short that it cannot save.
[time=2596] You think it is?
[time=2598] You don't know what I've done, Steve.
[time=2600] You're right.
[time=2601] I don't know what you've done.
[time=2602] I know what Jonah did.
[time=2608] Spectacular sin.
[time=2610] Jonah.
[time=2611] Spectacular sin.
[time=2613] He laughed.
[time=2614] He went down.
[time=2615] He bought a ticket.
[time=2616] He left the other.
[time=2620] His arm is not too short that it cannot save.
[time=2622] God's got very long arms.
[time=2626] He's able to reach you in whatever circumstance you find yourself this morning.
[time=2630] Do not let your circumstances dictate how you feel about God.
[time=2636] Let what you know about God be the way you see your circumstances not the other way around.
[time=2641] It's a great temptation.
[time=2642] I feel like I say that every time I'm with you, but it's good to be reminded.
[time=2646] Amen?
[time=2651] Our prayers are in trouble.
[time=2654] That's the first thing in the notes.
[time=2655] The second thing is this.
[time=2656] Our prayers should be from memory.
[time=2658] And by that, I don't mean that I should memorize my prayers necessarily.
[time=2662] If you want to, that's great.
[time=2663] There's great value in that.
[time=2665] I don't want to diminish it for a minute.
[time=2666] It's just not what I mean.
[time=2667] I mean that our prayers should be prompted by things that we know.
[time=2672] Jonas has in verse seven, "When my life was fainting away, I remembered the Lord."
[time=2680] Would you jot this down real quick too?
[time=2682] You can't remember what you don't know.
[time=2686] I wish I could put this under my pillow at night and it would just kind of seep in there.
[time=2692] It doesn't work like that.
[time=2694] It takes time.
[time=2696] When Kelly asked you to read the story of Jonah day by day this week, I hope that you did it.
[time=2701] If you don't have 15 minutes, I feel sorry for you.
[time=2705] I do.
[time=2706] I think that you do have that much time to read Jonah.
[time=2709] I think you do.
[time=2710] I hate it when I tell people that I'm busy.
[time=2712] It's true a lot of times.
[time=2714] How do you do Steve?
[time=2715] I'm busy.
[time=2716] I just hate it.
[time=2717] You know why I hate it?
[time=2718] Because it makes me forget things.
[time=2719] My busyness.
[time=2720] Oh, I forgot to call you.
[time=2721] I'm sorry.
[time=2722] Oh, I forgot to get that thing.
[time=2724] I'm sorry.
[time=2725] I hate that about my busyness because it's an enemy of my memory.
[time=2730] I forget things.
[time=2732] When my life was fainting away, I remembered the Lord and my prayer came to you into your holy temple, a place of refuge for him.
[time=2741] So Jonah remembers what God is like and that helps him face his circumstances.
[time=2745] I'll say that again.
[time=2747] Jonah remembers because he knows what God is like and that helps him to face his circumstances.
[time=2752] We often just do it the opposite way around and we shouldn't, we shouldn't.
[time=2761] Verse 8, "Those who pay regard to vain idols forsake their hope of steadfast love," Jonah
[time=2768] is trying to throw the sailors overboard here because they were worshiping other gods.
[time=2774] But they're the ones vindicated and Jonah's in the fish.
[time=2777] So Jonah's got it a little bit messed up here.
[time=2778] I don't know.
[time=2780] Maybe not.
[time=2780] Maybe Jonah is in this verse somewhere too, I don't know.
[time=2788] Jonah knows the right thing to say, he just gets tangled up in the details.
[time=2792] You feel like that?
[time=2793] I know the right thing, I just am afraid to do it.
[time=2796] I had a professor named Paul House and he said this in a book that he wrote about Jonah.
[time=2800] He said, "Stated theology will not suffice." That means that just because I know the right thing doesn't mean, but that's enough.
[time=2810] You guys down here at Blackhawk, I've been at Blackhawk now for a long time.
[time=2816] We had Homecoming last night, the school was a great night.
[time=2820] For lots of reasons, it was a great night.
[time=2822] But you guys that are at Blackhawk, maybe been there for a long, long time.
[time=2827] And this is a great danger for you because you know all the right things.
[time=2832] You've known them for a long, long time.
[time=2835] If theology will not suffice, there's more to the quote though, he says this, "Jonas in
[time=2843] our theology, when we think about God, must become as active as the Lord's concern."
[time=2851] So I can have all the right things up here and never get down here.
[time=2855] So a preacher once said that there's 18 inches between heaven and hell for every person.
[time=2862] I'm ahead in my heart, I think it's true.
[time=2868] The Bible has 234 mentions of the word remember.
[time=2871] It's everywhere because I forget since I remember, remember, remember, remember, remember.
[time=2877] When the Israelites came out of Egypt, there's all these calls to remember.
[time=2880] Don't forget that you are a slave, God says, because when you forget, you lose sight of things and you forget to be thankful.
[time=2889] Psalm 42.
[time=2892] Let's jump there for a minute.
[time=2894] Psalm 42, you know these verses.
[time=2898] As a dear pants for flowing streams, so pants my soul for you, oh God.
[time=2904] My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
[time=2909] When shall I come and appear before God?
[time=2912] My tears have been my food day and night.
[time=2916] Can I pause for a minute?
[time=2918] Again, I just don't think it's possible to read the Bible and not believe that you're okay when you struggle because the Psalmist is really not doing well here.
[time=2930] My tears have been my food day and night.
[time=2933] It's not going well.
[time=2937] I think the enemy is pleased when he lets us believe that you can't have a hard time
[time=2945] and be here.
[time=2946] The total opposite is true.
[time=2949] The time I need to be here the most is what I'm having a hard time.
[time=2952] I hope that you always are aware of that.
[time=2956] While they say to me all day long, where is your God?
[time=2960] Here's the Psalmist's response.
[time=2963] These things I remember as I pour out my soul, how I would go with the throng and lead them
[time=2970] in procession to the house of God with glad shouts and songs of praise and a multitude
[time=2976] keeping festival.
[time=2978] I remember what it was like when I was with God's people like right now and that gives me comfort when the winds blow and when it's cold outside and all the rest of it.
[time=2988] In conclusion this morning friends, part three of the outline is with thanksgiving.
[time=2997] With thanksgiving.
[time=2998] I'll read you another quote though while you're writing that down.
[time=3002] Our prayers are in trouble when we're in a bad place.
[time=3006] Our prayers are from memory, meaning that they're prompted by things that we know and the third thing I would say is this, our prayers are with thanksgiving.
[time=3013] This is a quote from Frederick Grant about how to read the Bible.
[time=3016] That seems really helpful.
[time=3017] It's really helped me this week.
[time=3021] We are frequently advised to read the Bible with our own personal needs in mind and to
[time=3027] look for answers to our private questions.
[time=3030] That's good as far as it goes.
[time=3033] But better still is the advice to study the Bible objectively, meaning read it for what it is, not for what I can get from it.
[time=3041] What the great passages fix themselves in our memory, let them stay there permanently,
[time=3048] like bright beacons launching their powerful shafts of light upon life's problems.
[time=3056] Our own problems, everyone's problems.
[time=3058] May it be so.
[time=3060] Verse 9, Jonah 2, "But I with the voice of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you."
[time=3066] Jonah is saying this in his bad circumstances, "What I have vowed I will pay, salvation
[time=3073] belongs to the Lord." Amen, amen.
[time=3080] The Lord spoke to the fish and vomited Jonah out upon the dry land.
[time=3086] That could not have been fun either.
[time=3090] So Jonah, I think at least for now, stands in right relationship with God that he's responded in the right way.
[time=3097] For a few hours he's doing okay.
[time=3099] It doesn't mean that he's saved from unpleasant consequences of his actions.
[time=3104] I think you think that sometimes, like, "Well, ask God to forgive me.
[time=3107] Why is everything better?" It's not better because sometimes disobedience has consequences.
[time=3116] It's okay.
[time=3117] You can face it knowing that God loves you and that he is for you.
[time=3125] As the band comes up on the stage, I just encourage you with this.
[time=3131] This is from Psalm 50.
[time=3136] Here, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, I will testify against you.
[time=3142] This is God talking.
[time=3143] I am God your God.
[time=3145] Not for your sacrifices, do I rebuke you?
[time=3147] Your burnt offerings are continually before me.
[time=3149] I will not accept the bull from your house or goats from your folds.
[time=3154] For every beast of the forest is mine that includes fish in the water, too.
[time=3159] The cattle on a thousand hills.
[time=3162] I know all the birds of the hills and all that moves in the field is mine.
[time=3167] If I were hungry I would not tell you the world that's fullness are mine.
[time=3171] You I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats, offer to God a sacrifice of
[time=3177] thanksgiving and perform your vows to the Most High and call upon me in the day of trouble.
[time=3189] I will deliver you and you shall glorify me.
[time=3193] Father, I pray this morning that we would sing these great songs through hymns of the
[time=3201] faith.
[time=3202] We would sing them with full hearts, hearts that understand God more about who you are
[time=3210] and what you're like.
[time=3213] God, I just know there's someone in this room that needs to cry out to you.
[time=3219] In this room that needs to respond to a God who loves and a God that is gracious and merciful
[time=3225] even in our trouble.
[time=3227] So pray that as we sing and as we conclude this morning by reading from your word that
[time=3233] you would draw them to yourself.
[time=3236] Pray all those things in Jesus' name.
[time=3238] It's a great thanksgiving, amen.
[time=3244] Stand with us.
[time=3255] Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty, early in the morning.
[time=3273] Our soul shall rise to thee.
[time=3283] Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty.
[time=3296] God, in three persons bless the Trinity.
[time=3311] Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,
[time=3561] [BLANK_AUDIO]
