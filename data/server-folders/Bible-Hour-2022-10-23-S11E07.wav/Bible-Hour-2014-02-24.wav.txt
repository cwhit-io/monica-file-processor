[time=60] >> Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast, it's great to have these few minutes with each and every one of you were thankful for all of you and so glad that we get to week after week, bring you what we consider to be the life changing eternity altering truth of God's word.
[time=81] It is something that we count as a privilege and as I continue to hear from so many of you week after week, and especially lately it seems as if many of you have been encouraged by and challenged by this look into the life and the story of Jonah.
[time=97] What a few weeks it's been and I hope this morning will be an encouragement to you as well on that front following Jonah.
[time=104] I want to tell you about a new series we'll start in just a couple of weeks, it's something I think that most everybody in our viewing audience, I know the entire family here at Black Hawk is going to I think really appreciate and enjoy and be challenged by.
[time=120] There are questions that we ask in life, there are circumstances that all of us face and over the years, over the centuries, throughout all of time, I think there have been these myths, there have been this way of thinking that the world has sort of adapted when it comes to dealing with some of the challenging issues of life.
[time=147] So we're heading into a series that we're entitling myth busters, and it has to do with the real serious and heartfelt questions that come to each and every one of us in life.
[time=159] What about purpose? Is there a greater transcendent purpose in life that we can actually grasp? What about the issue of fulfillment?
[time=171] Are there ways that we can actually and truly find lasting fulfillment? Is there a way we can make sense of suffering, purpose and fulfillment and suffering, and what about Jesus, the person, this historical figure, the perspectives that so many people have about him, Jesus, and then lastly, hope.
[time=196] Is there hope in the world? Is there a way that you and I, anyone can actually place their trust in something that will actually sustain them?
[time=206] Amazing questions, things we need to think through, things we want to look at and we'll do that in the weeks to come right here at Black Hawk on Sunday mornings.
[time=215] I hope you'll join us. I hope you'll come and be a part of what God's doing here in this community. Thank you so much for tuning in. Thanks for being a part of our family, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=245] Thanks for being a part of our family, we hope to see you soon.
[time=258] I see it near revival, stirring as we pray and see, we're on our knees, we're all our youth.
[time=278] Oh, better in the highest. Oh, better in the highest.
[time=295] Oh, better in the highest.
[time=308] [MUSIC]
[time=323] Hear my heart and make it new.
[time=329] Open up my eyes with a fingers.
[time=335] Show me how the love like you have loved me.
[time=343] Give my heart for a great soul.
[time=353] Everything I am for your kingdom's core.
[time=359] As I walk from our pit to eternity.
[time=371] Oh, better in the highest.
[time=432] [MUSIC]
[time=451] As morning dawn's adding in face.
[time=458] You inspire songs of grace that arise from earth to touch your heart.
[time=469] And glorify your name.
[time=474] And your name is a strong mind throughout your name.
[time=484] Is a shelter I know of in your name.
[time=490] Let the nation sing aloud.
[time=493] There's nothing else that I would just say.
[time=498] But your name.
[time=505] [MUSIC]
[time=512] Jesus, in your name we pray.
[time=518] Come and fill our heart today.
[time=524] Let give us strength to live for you.
[time=530] And glorify your name.
[time=535] Your name.
[time=539] Is a strong mind throughout your name.
[time=545] Is a shelter I know of in your name.
[time=551] Let the nation sing aloud.
[time=554] There's nothing else that I would just say.
[time=559] But your name.
[time=588] Your name.
[time=593] Is a strong mind throughout your name.
[time=599] Is a shelter I know of in your name.
[time=605] Let the nation sing aloud.
[time=608] There's nothing else that I would just say.
[time=613] Put your name.
[time=617] Is a strong mind throughout your name.
[time=623] Is a shelter I know of in your name.
[time=629] Let the nation sing aloud.
[time=632] There's nothing else that I would just say.
[time=649] Put your name.
[time=655] [MUSIC]
[time=664] [APPLAUSE]
[time=668] Alright, if you were, the band's going to keep playing.
[time=671] I actually kind of read something I saw this earlier this week.
[time=675] It's at a Roman seven.
[time=678] It might work best if it kind of close your eyes and kind of envision maybe conversation between you and God here.
[time=686] It goes like this.
[time=688] It says, "I'm full of myself.
[time=690] After all, I've spent a lot of time in sins prison.
[time=694] What I don't understand about myself is that I decide one way, but then I act another, doing things that I absolutely despise.
[time=703] So if I can't be trusted to figure out what is best for myself and then do it,
[time=709] it becomes obvious that God's command is necessary.
[time=713] But I need something more.
[time=715] For if I know the law, but still can't keep it, and if the power of sin within me keeps sabotaging my best intentions, I obviously need help.
[time=727] I realize that I don't have what it takes.
[time=730] I can will it, but I can't do it.
[time=733] I decide to do good, but I don't really do it.
[time=737] I decide not to do bad, but then I do it anyway.
[time=741] My decisions, such as they are, don't result in actions.
[time=747] Something has gone wrong, deep within me, and gets the better of me every time.
[time=753] It happens so regularly that it's predictable.
[time=757] The moment I decide to do good, sin is there to trick me up.
[time=761] I truly delight in God's commands, but it's pretty obvious that not all of me joins in that delight.
[time=767] Parts of me covertly rebel, and just when I least expect it, they take charge.
[time=773] I've tried everything, and nothing helps.
[time=777] I'm at the end of my rope.
[time=779] No one who can do anything for me isn't that the real question.
[time=783] The answer, thank God, is that Jesus Christ can, and he does.
[time=790] God, we thank you this morning.
[time=793] We acknowledge.
[time=795] We are completely and totally dead in our sin.
[time=800] No matter how small or great we think that is, it's the end of us.
[time=807] And we realize that, yeah, there are those times where we really, really want to do what's right, but it seems so hard, and so many times we end up doing what's wrong.
[time=818] And God, the question really is, is there anything out there that can change me, that can save me?
[time=826] And the answer is you.
[time=830] God, teach us to call on you.
[time=835] Teach us to say that you are enough for us in every circumstance.
[time=865] Christ is my reward, and all my devotion.
[time=878] And now there's nothing in this world that could ever satisfy.
[time=888] To every trial my soul will see, no turning back.
[time=897] I've been set free, and Christ is enough for me.
[time=907] Christ is enough for me.
[time=915] Everything I need is in you.
[time=920] You're everything I need.
[time=924] Christ is my all-in-all.
[time=929] We join my salvation.
[time=936] And this hope will never fail.
[time=941] Heaven is our hope.
[time=946] To every storm my soul will see.
[time=952] Jesus is here to God be the glory.
[time=960] Christ is enough for me.
[time=973] Everything I need is in you.
[time=979] You're everything I need.
[time=982] Christ is enough for me.
[time=997] Everything I need is in you.
[time=1003] You're everything I need.
[time=1017] I have decided, I have decided to follow Jesus, no turning back.
[time=1027] No turning back, I have decided to follow Jesus, no turning back, no turning back.
[time=1040] The cross before me, the cross before me, the world behind me, no turning back.
[time=1050] No turning back, the cross before me, the world behind me, no turning back, no turning back.
[time=1066] Christ is enough for me.
[time=1081] Everything I need is in you.
[time=1087] You're everything I need.
[time=1097] Christ is enough for me.
[time=1105] Everything I need is in you.
[time=1111] You're everything I need.
[time=1113] I have decided, I have decided to follow Jesus, no turning back.
[time=1123] No turning back, I have decided to follow Jesus, no turning back, no turning back.
[time=1163] I want to remind you of something that is really important for us, I think, to be reminded
[time=1177] of periodically, and before Jesse comes, and I'm really thankful that Jesse's coming this
[time=1184] morning to teach through Jonah 3, especially because of what I'm about to say right now.
[time=1190] I was reminded of this week in a teaching that I heard everybody, everybody in this room,
[time=1198] everybody in the world, everybody you know and I know, I believe lives each day of our
[time=1204] existence, pretty much in one of four places.
[time=1210] Everybody, think about four corners, and here's how this works.
[time=1216] Everybody lives in one of these four corners, one corner is a place that we'll call disconnected.
[time=1224] And I see this all the time.
[time=1227] I bump into this, I do my best to encourage those who are in this place.
[time=1232] I myself have been in this place.
[time=1234] There is this corner called disconnected.
[time=1237] See, God's called us to live actually in connection with him, but there are so many people today who are distant from him.
[time=1245] They're not only distant from God, they're distant from others in their life.
[time=1249] There are people who because of their hurts, because of their hang-ups, because of their struggles, because of their pain.
[time=1256] They've just chosen now to live in this place of isolation.
[time=1261] They don't really relate to, they don't really come alongside, they don't really live in any
[time=1267] kind of meaningful relationship with anyone, anywhere, at any time.
[time=1273] They're disconnected and alone.
[time=1278] Some people live in another corner, and we'll call this corner bad connection.
[time=1284] Bad connection, bad connection is this.
[time=1287] You might be in this place, bad connections when you're sort of trying to be in relationship.
[time=1293] You're moving toward connection, and yet the fact is the people or the person you're trying
[time=1300] to live with is abusive.
[time=1304] It's unhealthy.
[time=1306] It's critical.
[time=1308] It's diminishing.
[time=1309] It's demeaning.
[time=1311] The fact of the matter is there's a lot of people in this world, young and old, and they find themselves in situations where what's transpiring is really, really unhealthy, not at all
[time=1322] honoring to God, and it's chipping away at their soul, and they live in this place of bad connection.
[time=1329] There's a third corner where people live.
[time=1332] Many of you here in the room this morning may be in this third corner, and it's often the place that disconnected and people living in bad connection kind of run to.
[time=1342] It's a place we'll call pseudo or fake connection.
[time=1350] This is food.
[time=1353] This is booze.
[time=1355] This is pornography.
[time=1357] This is drugs.
[time=1360] This is anything at all in this world, and believe me, you know and I know there is no shortage of these things.
[time=1366] This is the stuff of self-medication.
[time=1370] This is where we run to at times, because there's this promise that somehow if we can
[time=1377] get into this connection, it's all going to be better, and every one of us in this room pretty much knows that that's alive, that it's not better, and there is no connection there,
[time=1389] and there is nothing fulfilled there, and so we have disconnected people and badly connected
[time=1395] people and fake connection going on, and I just want to remind you today that we all should
[time=1402] be so very grateful that we get to be a part of a ministry that offers a fourth corner, and that's called real connection, amen?
[time=1410] Jesus said I am the way, the truth, and the what?
[time=1413] The life.
[time=1415] There is a life, my friends.
[time=1418] It's true.
[time=1419] There is a life.
[time=1420] There is a place.
[time=1421] There is a relationship with God that we get to experience through his son, and it's not
[time=1427] isolated.
[time=1428] No, it's connected, and there is intimacy, and there can be transparency, and there can be grace and unconditional acceptance, and I am so grateful for that in my own life, as
[time=1439] I've announced around those three corners at times.
[time=1442] All of us here know what it's like.
[time=1444] I want to just remind you of that.
[time=1446] Our whole team, we know what it's like to be disconnected, to be badly connected, to pursue
[time=1453] fake connection, and we want to just tell you again how thankful we are that we get to be a part of something that offers that which is real and lasting and true and genuine,
[time=1464] and Jesse is one on our team who I think really reminds me of this more often than anyone
[time=1470] else.
[time=1471] He's got this enormous heart and passion for those who are on the outside looking in.
[time=1475] He's got this incredible desire for us to be a place that reaches out to connect with
[time=1481] and helps people in those places understand what it's like to come to a place of relationship
[time=1487] and life in Christ, and so be encouraged by that.
[time=1491] I'm so thankful we get to hear from him today.
[time=1493] Would you welcome Jesse as he comes this morning?
[time=1496] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1503] Good morning.
[time=1506] Yes, I like those four areas.
[time=1509] That's good.
[time=1512] I think what I'd like to do is just say thanks for having me here this morning.
[time=1517] Whether you're listening online or watching at home or maybe you did something radical and you came to this building, real thankful you're here, you braved the snow, and I'm
[time=1528] sure like me and like you, you're probably going to go home and shovel again.
[time=1535] So, that's good.
[time=1537] Like you said, my name is Jesse and I'm on the team here at Blackhawk.
[time=1540] I'm excited to enter into week three of the "I Am Jonah" series, Jonah chapter three.
[time=1546] Before I do that, I would just like to read the chapter.
[time=1549] So, if you have a Bible, you could open it up to Jonah chapter three and I'll read that.
[time=1556] And then I've just got a few introductory statements about the book and then I've got a few things I'd like to say about chapter three itself.
[time=1564] Jonah chapter three starting in verse one.
[time=1567] "Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time.
[time=1570] Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.
[time=1574] Jonah obeyed the word of the Lord and went to Nineveh.
[time=1577] Now, Nineveh was a very important city.
[time=1581] It required a visit of three days.
[time=1584] On the first day, Jonah started into the city.
[time=1587] He proclaimed 40 more days and Nineveh will be overturned.
[time=1591] The Ninevites believed God.
[time=1594] They declared it fast and all of them from the greatest to the least put on sat cloth.
[time=1599] When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne.
[time=1603] He took off his row robes, covered himself with sat cloth and sat down in the dust.
[time=1608] Then he issued a proclamation in Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles.
[time=1614] "Do not let any man or beast heard or flock taste anything.
[time=1618] Do not let them eat or drink.
[time=1620] But let man and beast be covered with sat cloth.
[time=1623] Let everyone call urgently on God.
[time=1627] Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.
[time=1631] Who knows?
[time=1633] God may relent and with compassion turned from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.
[time=1640] When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he had compassion and did not bring upon them the destruction he had threatened."
[time=1651] Jonah chapter three.
[time=1654] As you know, the first week KB talked to us about our Ninevites and going to those Ninevites.
[time=1659] None of us might be who they might be and what they might look like to go and enter into that or maybe building a relationship or starting a conversation with somebody who is in our Nineveh.
[time=1670] Week two, Webby talked to us about prayer that we can pray in any circumstances no matter our faults or failures.
[time=1677] We can code a God.
[time=1679] I think this Jonah in me and for the way I view this, it's this story.
[time=1684] It's got some great theology in it.
[time=1686] I'm just going to share three of them with you.
[time=1688] The first one is this.
[time=1690] God is sovereign creator.
[time=1693] We see this throughout the scriptures and I think in Jonah we see it very clearly.
[time=1700] Jonah is on the boat and the storm is kind of brewing and it's kind of throwing things.
[time=1706] It's just crazy and the sailors are all praying to their gods and the sales yell at Jonah.
[time=1710] Get up and pray to you from, pray to your God.
[time=1713] And Jonah says, "I am a Hebrew." He says this in one nine.
[time=1716] "I am a Hebrew and I worship the Lord God of heaven who made the sea and the land." What a statement from a Jonah who's being so disobedient.
[time=1726] He had the right belief.
[time=1730] And in Jonah's mind he would understand God to be the providential controller of all things.
[time=1735] He holds the heavens and the earth and the seas and the land in his control.
[time=1740] And he can manifest his power through this natural world and he can manipulate it to bring about his purposes.
[time=1747] For he is God.
[time=1748] He is sovereign creator.
[time=1751] Second thing I notice from reading the entire story of Jonah from one to four and the 48 verses we get a lot.
[time=1757] Number two, God is judge of all the earth.
[time=1762] God is judge of all the earth.
[time=1764] God tells Jonah to go, tell Nineveh that judgment is coming.
[time=1771] That I'm coming to town.
[time=1774] See God is the standard.
[time=1777] Whether we believe in God or not.
[time=1779] Or do we believe he exists or not?
[time=1782] God is the standard and he has every right to call us as his creation.
[time=1786] As the judge to live up to his standards.
[time=1792] He is just.
[time=1794] He is the judge.
[time=1795] He is the king of kings and Lord of lords.
[time=1798] He is the universal power.
[time=1800] God of moral order in our world.
[time=1803] No matter where we exist or what we think, he rules.
[time=1806] He is God.
[time=1807] He is Yahweh.
[time=1808] He has the authority.
[time=1809] And he tells Jonah to go.
[time=1811] He looks at that great city and he says, not anymore.
[time=1814] That's not going to work anymore.
[time=1817] Jonah, go tell him I'm coming to town and it's not going to go well.
[time=1821] But Jonah, as you know, says sure, yep, get right on that.
[time=1827] I'll do that.
[time=1829] Yep, God.
[time=1830] Yep, I heard you.
[time=1831] I wrote it down.
[time=1832] He goes the other way.
[time=1835] I think we do that a lot.
[time=1838] But Jonah isn't destroyed.
[time=1841] Jonah could have drowned.
[time=1843] He wanted it.
[time=1844] Throw me overboard.
[time=1845] Yep, I'm good.
[time=1846] I'd rather drown than go to that evil city.
[time=1850] But God doesn't allow him to die.
[time=1854] God doesn't let him just drown.
[time=1857] I think the third thing we see is that God is a God of grace.
[time=1866] At the end of the story, we've spoken from Jonah out of Jonah's mouth.
[time=1870] And four, verse two.
[time=1873] God is a God of grace.
[time=1883] This is an amazing story of grace.
[time=1886] Second chances after second chances.
[time=1889] The Gentile pirates.
[time=1891] They're saved from the storm.
[time=1893] One commentator wrote, Yahweh is no arbitrator, Herod, who slew all to slay one.
[time=1900] He loves his creation.
[time=1902] He wants to preserve them.
[time=1905] He wants them to come to him.
[time=1907] He wants their hearts.
[time=1908] He wants them to turn their lives towards him.
[time=1911] The amazing story of grace typified in the fish.
[time=1914] It's clearly a mighty portrayed in the story.
[time=1916] A great fish of grace.
[time=1919] I've never been swallowed by a fish, but I have been swallowed by his grace.
[time=1924] I'm pretty sure you have to.
[time=1927] It's a cool story of grace.
[time=1930] So now we find our young hero who's not so heroish.
[time=1935] Freshly vomited out of the fish.
[time=1938] On the dry ground.
[time=1940] It's cool because in my version of the Bible and I've eaten.
[time=1943] There's multiple ways.
[time=1944] They all say the same thing.
[time=1945] I really do.
[time=1946] Mine uses vomit.
[time=1947] I was so excited to use that word in church today.
[time=1951] Vomit.
[time=1952] It's just such a great bit.
[time=1954] He belches him up.
[time=1955] He's on the ground.
[time=1956] He's laying there.
[time=1958] Great fish of grace.
[time=1960] Grace.
[time=1961] And so if you have your bulletin, you can pull it out.
[time=1963] I'll be referring to it as I go.
[time=1965] I'm just going to take three little sections.
[time=1967] Jonah's second chance.
[time=1969] Nineveh's 180.
[time=1970] God's response.
[time=1974] I'll start in verse one and two.
[time=1977] I'm excited to share this with you.
[time=1980] Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah the second time saying, "Arise, go to Nineveh.
[time=1984] The great city and call out against it.
[time=1986] The message that I tell you." Jonah gets a second chance.
[time=1990] Right?
[time=1991] He grows through this whole ordeal.
[time=1992] He's in the ocean.
[time=1993] He's getting the fish.
[time=1994] He doesn't want to obey.
[time=1995] But God gives him a second chance.
[time=1997] The word came to Jonah a second time.
[time=2002] And this time he's ready.
[time=2004] Okay, God.
[time=2005] I got it.
[time=2006] Don't send an octopus.
[time=2009] I'll do it.
[time=2011] I'm going.
[time=2012] I don't think he still doesn't want to.
[time=2014] We'll see that at the end next week.
[time=2015] He's still kind of...
[time=2016] Just doesn't want those Ninevites to have any grace from God.
[time=2023] So he's ready.
[time=2024] His ears are open.
[time=2025] He's pins ready.
[time=2026] Let me know what the message is.
[time=2027] I'll write it down.
[time=2028] I'm going.
[time=2029] So he gets up off the ground.
[time=2030] Like I said, freshly vomited out of the fish.
[time=2033] See how I snuck it in there again.
[time=2035] And he's got seaweed all over him and fish guts.
[time=2037] He gets off and he's...
[time=2040] Right?
[time=2041] So he heads off to Nineveh.
[time=2043] And maybe, Chris, if you would, maybe he's singing this song.
[time=2047] Maybe this song's in the back.
[time=2048] If it was a movie, this song would kind of be playing as we see him kind of get up and walk to Nineveh.
[time=2055] Maybe, Chris, you got that for me?
[time=2057] Maybe.
[time=2058] Right?
[time=2059] Maybe this song.
[time=2060] Do you see the movie?
[time=2063] You guys know this song?
[time=2066] Okay.
[time=2067] That's good.
[time=2074] Right.
[time=2075] Maybe that song's playing.
[time=2077] I'm just trying to spice it up a little this morning.
[time=2079] Snow.
[time=2080] Chumba Wumba.
[time=2081] I get knocked down, but I get up again.
[time=2083] You're never going to keep me down.
[time=2085] Yeah.
[time=2086] That's the lyrics.
[time=2087] So he got knocked down, but he got up again.
[time=2089] God gave him a second chance and he's often in a v. goes.
[time=2092] Right?
[time=2093] However, I think it's interesting that at this point in the story, Jonah is the only character in this, in the 48 verses that isn't obedient up to this point.
[time=2103] Right?
[time=2104] If we look at the storm, the sea, if these were characters in the story, the fish, the plant.
[time=2110] Right?
[time=2111] Remember the chichichichichichi plant that kind of came out of nowhere?
[time=2114] The worm, the sun, the east wind.
[time=2117] All of those were obedient, but not Jonah.
[time=2121] Not man.
[time=2122] Only man cannot glorify God in the way he was created to.
[time=2127] We're special that way.
[time=2131] Not Jonah.
[time=2132] He runs.
[time=2133] He hides.
[time=2134] He does the opposite.
[time=2135] And then my question is why didn't God just let him drown?
[time=2138] Right?
[time=2139] It'd been a great terror story.
[time=2142] Right?
[time=2143] Jonah.
[time=2144] God.
[time=2144] God comes to Jonah.
[time=2145] Go and tell the number.
[time=2146] Nope.
[time=2147] Dead.
[time=2148] It'd be a little shorter.
[time=2151] But He doesn't.
[time=2154] Why not?
[time=2155] He's just a prophet.
[time=2157] He's got plenty of people he could have said, "Hey, go to Nineveh." I think there's a tenderness of God towards Jonah.
[time=2167] I think there's this God of Jonah is gracious and compassionate and slow to anger.
[time=2173] You didn't do what I asked.
[time=2174] You did it.
[time=2175] In fact, you did the opposite.
[time=2176] You refused to a certain death to the point of death.
[time=2179] And I think God with great meekness, which I like to call meekness, power under control,
[time=2185] harnesses the forces of nature to formulate a lesson for Jonah and for us.
[time=2190] And it's a great picture of what grace is really about.
[time=2194] Jonah gets a second chance.
[time=2196] In your notes, if you're taking notes in your outline next to that letter A, you could write grace to one.
[time=2203] Jonah receives grace and he gets a second chance.
[time=2206] And a follow-up question to that is, is there somebody in your life and your sphere of influence
[time=2214] in the world you go around in that needs grace?
[time=2221] Is there a husband or a wife that needs some grace?
[time=2226] Maybe your kids, maybe a co-worker, maybe your boss, maybe your BFF, best friend for life?
[time=2241] Maybe they need some grace?
[time=2244] Maybe there's somebody in your sphere who doesn't know who Jesus Christ is.
[time=2250] And the way they're living is just driving you crazy and you just want to yell at them, throw things at them.
[time=2257] Maybe we should lead with grace.
[time=2260] We can't blame the dark for being dark.
[time=2263] If they don't know Jesus, they don't know Jesus.
[time=2269] Maybe they need some grace instead of wrath.
[time=2274] Grace, as I love you, law says you're an idiot.
[time=2278] Lead with grace.
[time=2280] I think grace wins every time.
[time=2283] Lead with grace.
[time=2285] Number two, letter B in your outline, Nineveh's 180, Nineveh's 180.
[time=2293] Jonah began to go into the city going a day's journey and he called out 40 days and Nineveh
[time=2300] shall be overthrown.
[time=2302] Now in the studies that I was reading it said that it would take three days to walk all the way through the city.
[time=2309] But Jonah only gets a day in.
[time=2311] It's a big city.
[time=2313] It's a big place.
[time=2314] Lots of evil.
[time=2315] It's called the great city because it's so great and it's so far from God.
[time=2320] It's just great evil there.
[time=2322] Jonah, he goes on this hike.
[time=2324] He's hiking the whole day.
[time=2325] He's not reached the heart of the city yet, but that's enough.
[time=2329] That's God.
[time=2330] I'm there.
[time=2331] He could have just stopped.
[time=2333] He's not better to at least go a little bit.
[time=2336] I'd better go a little further.
[time=2337] He feels small.
[time=2338] He still smells of the innards of the fish.
[time=2340] He's probably a little sickly.
[time=2342] He probably looks a little odd.
[time=2344] This guy who just got vomited out.
[time=2348] Another one.
[time=2350] One man against a vast city.
[time=2352] He's probably just tired of this whole ordeal.
[time=2355] It's like I'm not going any further.
[time=2357] I'm just going to drop the message right here.
[time=2361] This is far enough.
[time=2362] He's just over this whole road trip.
[time=2364] And he preaches.
[time=2365] He just says this one thing.
[time=2367] We were joking before, maybe it was under his breath.
[time=2372] Whatever.
[time=2373] Good luck.
[time=2375] I'm out.
[time=2377] But he says, "Yet 40 days in Nineveh shall be overthrown.
[time=2381] Yet 40 days in Nineveh shall be overthrown." In your outline there, next to the letter, be right.
[time=2386] Grace to a city.
[time=2392] And you would be asking, "How is that grace?"
[time=2398] Destruction is coming.
[time=2401] Warning.
[time=2402] Destruction is coming.
[time=2403] How is that grace?
[time=2406] 40 days.
[time=2408] It's grace because it's a warning.
[time=2412] It's grace because God says, "Hey, I'm warning you.
[time=2417] Bad things are going to come Nineveh." So Yahweh is God over all the nations.
[time=2425] And he places his standard upon all of us.
[time=2428] Romans 1, 18 to 20.
[time=2430] And God would have been justified, just wiping them out.
[time=2434] Destruction.
[time=2436] Sodom and Gomorrah isk.
[time=2438] But he doesn't.
[time=2441] He sends Jonah.
[time=2442] First of all, he has to work through Jonah.
[time=2445] He was totally disobedient.
[time=2446] Grace to Jonah to get Grace to Nineveh through a warning.
[time=2451] He could have just destroyed, but he doesn't.
[time=2457] See, I think God's ultimate purpose is to drive people to himself, to bend that knee, to repent, to come to know him as Lord and Savior.
[time=2469] God takes no delight in the death of the wicked.
[time=2472] He wants people to be saved.
[time=2473] He loves what he created.
[time=2474] He wants all people to be saved and come to the knowledge of truth.
[time=2477] 1 Timothy 2, 4.
[time=2479] God wants us to know that there's grace there.
[time=2483] There's love.
[time=2485] And he warns them.
[time=2487] He provides grace.
[time=2488] He warns them that he's coming to town.
[time=2491] 40 days typically means like a waiting period or a testing period.
[time=2495] But the fact that there's announcement is this amazing, amazing grace.
[time=2505] Nineveh gets a second chance.
[time=2508] And Nineveh's response, verses five to eight.
[time=2512] Listen to what happens after Jonah preaches a very short sentence.
[time=2518] Maybe under his background.
[time=2520] Maybe.
[time=2521] And here's what happens.
[time=2522] And the people of Nineveh believed God.
[time=2525] They called for a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest of them to the least of them.
[time=2531] The word reached the king of Nineveh, and he rose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth and sat in ashes.
[time=2540] And he issued a proclamation and published through Nineveh by the Cree of the king and his nobles.
[time=2546] Let neither man nor beast heard nor flock taste anything.
[time=2551] Let them not feed or drink water, but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth.
[time=2557] And let them call out mightily to God.
[time=2560] And let everyone turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands.
[time=2565] The people of Nineveh believe God, revival breaks out.
[time=2569] And there's a couple of things that happen.
[time=2571] The first thing we see is that the people, there's like the people start doing these religious activities.
[time=2576] Right?
[time=2577] They start, they fast.
[time=2578] They're not going to eat anything.
[time=2580] They put on sackcloth.
[time=2581] It's real scratchy.
[time=2582] And it makes you just, it's like you're mourning.
[time=2584] It's like you put it on because you're sorry.
[time=2586] You feel guilty about something and you're trying to show that you're remorseful.
[time=2590] So they put those things on.
[time=2593] And then the reaction to the king, the king and then it gets up off his throne and moves his robes and puts on sackcloth and sits in ashes.
[time=2601] The king, the royalty, responds.
[time=2604] Not just the people, not just maybe the ten people heard him at the beginning or how many people were right there.
[time=2609] But this thing spread through the whole city all the way to the king.
[time=2613] The king repents.
[time=2617] And then only not only do the king repent, but then he puts out a whole decree.
[time=2621] So the whole city has to hear this now.
[time=2623] These things, this is coming, this decree comes out.
[time=2626] It reinforces and amplifies the people's reaction.
[time=2629] The decree proclaims that no man or beast or flocker.
[time=2632] Nobody's eaten anything.
[time=2635] Not the dog, not the cat, not the goat.
[time=2640] Nobody.
[time=2641] And they even put sackcloth on their animals.
[time=2645] This is a huge response.
[time=2647] It's surprising how overwhelming this response is.
[time=2653] Revival breaks out.
[time=2654] They believe God.
[time=2656] No one's eating, no one's drinking.
[time=2658] And he tells them to call out, "Miley to God." "Oh God, please, don't destroy us." "Oh God, please, oh God." Just hear that whole city, all the people crying out.
[time=2672] It could just be a powerful image if we could go back there and look at it in a time machine.
[time=2676] It's so cool.
[time=2678] They're just crying out.
[time=2679] And they all got sackcloth.
[time=2680] No one's eating anything.
[time=2682] Revival breaks out.
[time=2683] And then verse 9.
[time=2685] Look at verse 9.
[time=2687] Who knows?
[time=2692] God may turn and relent and turn from his fierce anger so that we may not perish.
[time=2697] Who knows?
[time=2701] There's this tension in this message where there's this huge response of them repenting and turning
[time=2708] and doing these religious activities with this.
[time=2712] So you're saying there's a chance, right?
[time=2716] Maybe, maybe, they don't know.
[time=2721] All for all they know is destruction is coming and they're just doing what they can.
[time=2725] Maybe God will turn.
[time=2727] See, I say that because there's nothing that can manipulate God.
[time=2732] Not repentance.
[time=2733] Not sacrifice.
[time=2734] Not prayer.
[time=2735] Not fasting.
[time=2738] Not sackcloth.
[time=2740] Or helping old ladies across the street or jesting nice for church.
[time=2744] Or even reading our Bibles.
[time=2745] Nothing can manipulate God.
[time=2748] He's the sovereign creator.
[time=2750] He's the just judge.
[time=2752] But he is also a God of grace.
[time=2755] Strict justice would demand that death and punishment would come.
[time=2760] Jonah should perish.
[time=2761] The Ninevite should perish.
[time=2763] But Yahweh's mercy and grace prevail.
[time=2768] And over and over and over and the scriptures we see this.
[time=2776] We see grace to all and your outline put grace to all.
[time=2781] Because we see God's response.
[time=2785] Jack Heyford, a great pastor from California says this, "Grace is God meeting us at a point of need in the person of Jesus Christ." I like that.
[time=2794] Jonah goes from this hater prophet in the belly of the great fish to obedient hater prophet in the belly of a great city.
[time=2803] It's a super short message and the Ninevites believe God.
[time=2806] Revival breaks out and all the people and all the animals are turning and making efforts.
[time=2809] And then we have God's response verse 10.
[time=2811] When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them.
[time=2819] And he did not do it.
[time=2823] It's grace.
[time=2830] He did not do it.
[time=2833] God pardons Nineveh by his amazing transforming grace.
[time=2838] God harnesses the forces of nature to formulate a lesson in what true grace is really about.
[time=2843] It's an awesome picture of grace.
[time=2846] God used, just like us, a reluctant stubborn hater prophet
[time=2855] who when asked to go to Nineveh went and bought a ticket to Not Nineveh, as KB told us week one, Not Nineveh.
[time=2863] But God in his unrelenting power, love, and grace rescues him from certain death, offers him a second chance.
[time=2870] Take this message to a broken, evil city full of people who had decided to fill their lives with Not God.
[time=2880] And they believed, and they trusted.
[time=2884] And this transcending, transforming grace rescues and saves.
[time=2892] Just like us.
[time=2897] I know KB asks us the first week to think through what is or who is our Nineveh.
[time=2903] We are Nineveh.
[time=2907] Every single one of us at some point in our lives have filled our lives with Not God.
[time=2915] Every one of us, we were dead in our transgressions.
[time=2919] We were lost in our sins.
[time=2923] It's like the verse that Dr. Jones read in the music.
[time=2928] We do these things.
[time=2929] We don't want to do.
[time=2930] We don't know why we're prisoners of our sin.
[time=2932] We fill our lives with Not God.
[time=2934] But grace comes through.
[time=2939] Grace, we have a second chance.
[time=2944] Ephesians 2.89 says this, "For by grace you have been saved.
[time=2949] I'll never get tired of this verse.
[time=2954] For by grace you have been saved." And that not of yourselves is a gift of God, not of works, at least anyone should boast.
[time=2964] It's a gift.
[time=2965] You can't earn it.
[time=2968] You can't perform for it.
[time=2972] You can't get a degree.
[time=2974] So you get a job in grace.
[time=2978] It's free.
[time=2979] It's a gift.
[time=2980] For by grace we have been saved.
[time=2982] And a long time ago God did something when he climbed down from heaven to go to a world
[time=2988] that was full of Not God.
[time=2992] And for people who are full of Not God.
[time=2996] He sent his son Jesus Christ to take on humanity and die on the cross.
[time=3001] He sent grace for all.
[time=3005] And through the cross we are offered a grace, a second chance when we simply trust that Jesus paid for our sins, when we trust that he died on the cross, when we trust that he rose again to make new life avail for each one of us.
[time=3019] And when we step across that line, when we decide to follow Jesus as our Lord and Savior, when we enter into a relationship with him, he adopts us as sons and daughters of the king.
[time=3032] And our sonship is not based on our performance, but on Jesus' finished work, his finished performance, and our trust in that finished work.
[time=3040] It's not about us.
[time=3042] See, when we focus on our sin, when we focus on the rules of the faith, when we focus on not sinning, we focus on ourselves, but when we focus on grace,
[time=3055] and we focus on the cross, then our eyes and our heart are focused on what it should be,
[time=3062] and that's Jesus Christ, not on us.
[time=3066] When we make it about what I do and what I don't do, we make it about us.
[time=3072] And the central message of God is, I want a people for myself.
[time=3077] And all the things that God has done throughout salvation history has been about getting a people for himself.
[time=3084] Look what he did with Jonah, didn't destroy, he rescued grace.
[time=3088] Look at the Ninevites, he could have destroyed him, didn't do it.
[time=3091] He offered grace.
[time=3093] Look at us before we walked, or before we stepped across that line with Jesus.
[time=3099] Some of you, right?
[time=3101] That was me.
[time=3102] I had filled my life with not God.
[time=3104] And then God entered, and grace came in and washed me clean.
[time=3109] It was powerful.
[time=3111] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that pardoned in of the end me, and maybe you.
[time=3120] Maybe you.
[time=3121] I love those four corners that KB mentioned at the beginning.
[time=3126] Some of you here are disconnected from God.
[time=3130] And I'm glad you're here.
[time=3132] Maybe you're listening online.
[time=3134] Maybe you're at home watching the broadcast.
[time=3136] Maybe your head's on a pillow.
[time=3138] And you're just disconnected from God.
[time=3140] You've never plugged in to God.
[time=3142] You've never stepped across that line and said, "Okay, it's time.
[time=3145] I'm going to trust Christ with my life." Maybe that's you.
[time=3150] Hey, and if that's you, that's okay.
[time=3152] But don't miss this message.
[time=3155] Don't miss the salvation and the love and the grace that God offers.
[time=3163] Maybe you're here, and you've trusted Jesus.
[time=3166] And you know kind of what I'm talking about when I say relationship with Christ.
[time=3172] Maybe you're here.
[time=3173] Maybe you just need to remind yourself of what saved you, and it's the grace.
[time=3178] It's not your works.
[time=3179] Maybe there's somebody here, and you've trusted in Christ.
[time=3182] But for whatever reason, circumstances in life, and family, and kids, and work, and just stuff has just kind of bogged you down, and it just weighs in your light, like a wet blanket.
[time=3194] And you've been filling your life with not God.
[time=3200] Maybe it's time for you to turn and cry out mightily to God.
[time=3207] Just let him know where you're at.
[time=3209] Let him know you need grace.
[time=3212] Let him know you love him, and you're sorry for where you've been, but you're so excited where he can take you.
[time=3218] Maybe there's somebody here today, and you're still, you're just not even sure what this stuff is.
[time=3221] I'm talking Jesus.
[time=3222] I don't know what Jesus is.
[time=3224] I'm going to know what God you're talking about.
[time=3226] I'm just glad you're here.
[time=3229] I'm thankful you're listening.
[time=3231] But don't stay there.
[time=3233] Let's talk about, ask some questions.
[time=3236] Come talk to me.
[time=3237] Come talk to our elders.
[time=3238] That's why we're here.
[time=3239] That's why this church exists to proclaim the good news of the gospel.
[time=3242] There's a stage in the building.
[time=3244] Who cares?
[time=3245] God sent Jesus to die in the cross, to bring grace, to bring second chance for us so that we can live with him forever.
[time=3253] That's what it's about.
[time=3255] Yay, man.
[time=3256] That's what it's about.
[time=3259] And if you're here and you're not sure about all that, let's talk.
[time=3262] Let's go to coffee.
[time=3264] Let's just talk.
[time=3265] Because that's what it's about.
[time=3267] You can fill your life with so many not God things and you'll never be satisfied.
[time=3271] I tried.
[time=3272] I know there's so many people in here who have tried as well.
[time=3275] We could, every single one of us who's stepped across, I could stand up and say, yep, been there.
[time=3280] I tried that.
[time=3281] It didn't go so well.
[time=3286] But it doesn't have to stay that way.
[time=3288] God offers second chance after second chance after second chance.
[time=3293] Don't reject the amazing transforming power of grace as found in Jesus Christ.
[time=3300] This is a story I read in a book by a youth worker who's probably one of my heroes of the youth workers,
[time=3307] Mike Yaconelli.
[time=3308] And I'll try to remember it.
[time=3310] It was something like this.
[time=3312] There was a platoon of guys in a war.
[time=3315] I think it was World War I.
[time=3317] And they were fighting.
[time=3318] One of their guys got shot and he died.
[time=3321] And the rest of the guys on his team and his platoon wanted to bury him.
[time=3325] They wanted to give him a Christian.
[time=3326] They wanted to find a place to bury him.
[time=3328] And they remembered a church a mile back that they had passed from their marching.
[time=3332] So they got the permission from their commander in chief and they grabbed this guy and they take him down there and they knock on the door of the church and this old kind of decrepit, really old looking pastor guy opens the door and they're like, hey, you know, our fellow
[time=3348] soldier died and we want to bury him.
[time=3351] And the priest said, I'm sorry, only people with what same beliefs can be buried in this
[time=3357] graveyard.
[time=3358] There was a cemetery right next to the church.
[time=3360] And so they were kind of dejected.
[time=3362] And as they turned the guy, he kind of started shutting, pulled the door back over.
[time=3366] He said, wait, you can bury him outside the fence.
[time=3368] Go ahead and just bury him right outside the fence.
[time=3370] So they buried him and they went back to the front line of the fighting.
[time=3374] The next morning the fighting was over and they were going to march on.
[time=3377] They wanted to go say bye to their buddy one last time.
[time=3379] So they go down there and they can't find him.
[time=3382] It was dark.
[time=3383] They were a little disorientated in the dark.
[time=3384] They can't remember where they buried him.
[time=3386] They go up and they ask the pastor and they say, hey, do you remember where we buried him?
[time=3393] And he said, they said we buried him outside the fence.
[time=3396] He said, I tore the fence down last night.
[time=3400] That's what Jesus does.
[time=3403] He tears the fence down.
[time=3405] There's no more hurdles to cross.
[time=3407] There's no rules to get in there.
[time=3410] It's just wrong in Christ.
[time=3412] It tears the fence down.
[time=3414] That's what grace does.
[time=3415] It rips down fences.
[time=3416] It tears down walls.
[time=3417] It can free you from things that are holding you in bondage.
[time=3421] That's what grace can do.
[time=3426] It's powerful and it's real.
[time=3428] It's transforming.
[time=3431] I'm going to pray.
[time=3433] And as I pray, if you would just bow your heads and just think first.
[time=3436] So before I pray, just talk to God today.
[time=3439] Where are you at with this Jesus?
[time=3441] Where are you at with grace?
[time=3444] What do you need in your life?
[time=3446] What's going on with you and God?
[time=3447] Just take a few seconds and talk to God.
[time=3449] Go ahead.
[time=3450] Right where you're at.
[time=3451] That's what church is for.
[time=3452] It's just the church that you're at with the church.
[time=3516] God, we're so thankful for your love and your grace.
[time=3521] Sometimes it's just good to remember that we are saved by grace and nothing else.
[time=3528] I pray we remember that this week.
[time=3530] That we'll take grace to people, to our Nineveh, to ourselves.
[time=3535] That we'll stand firm in your grace.
[time=3541] That we'll be your people.
[time=3546] The way you intended us to be.
[time=3550] Keep us safe as we go.
[time=3551] Protect us.
[time=3553] Protect our thoughts and our minds as Satan wants to destroy.
[time=3556] That you want to bring life.
[time=3559] Thank you for that.
[time=3561] Pray all these things in Jesus' name.
[time=3563] [AMEN]
