[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=36] I wanted to take just a couple of minutes today if I could to tell you about a good friend.
[time=42] Actually, a good friend who I miss dearly over the last several years, there probably wasn't anybody who challenged me and encouraged me more
[time=52] when it came to the issue or the issues of physical fitness and pushing oneself.
[time=59] And the whole idea of biblical compassion than a guy named Dan Chitwood.
[time=64] Dan was a good friend of mine. Dan was a huge friend of this community.
[time=68] He pastored a church here in town, a great church out northwest called
[time=74] Crossbridge Community Church, and Dan left us this last year.
[time=79] He passed away and we miss him dearly.
[time=82] But while he was here, he really began a legacy.
[time=85] And the legacy was this idea of pushing oneself physically for the well-being of others.
[time=91] And his brother Michael Chitwood is the executive director of an organization called Team World Vision,
[time=98] part of World Vision International.
[time=101] Team World Vision organizes running teams to run in events and in the process of running as a team in an event they raise money.
[time=110] They raise resources for clean water in Africa.
[time=114] Clean water that will save lives. Clean water that will change communities.
[time=119] And I've been so inspired by it. I'm joined this morning by a good friend of mine, part of our family here at Blackhawk, Eric Emmley.
[time=127] How are you doing? Good, man. Good to see you. Glad you're with me.
[time=130] Eric, as you can see by the shirt that he's got on, I've got one just like it.
[time=135] I jumped in last year. Eric's done this for a while.
[time=138] But Eric's kind of helping head up our team here at Blackhawk.
[time=141] We are looking forward to the Fort for Fitness.
[time=144] The Fort for Fitness race, which is when?
[time=147] End of September. End of September.
[time=149] And what we're going to do, Blackhawk, I think along with actually some other churches and ministry organizations, we're going to come alongside to honor Dan.
[time=157] We want to, this year, do something that I think his family would really appreciate.
[time=163] I know he would be proud of. We're going to do our best to raise funds.
[time=167] Just in a real nutshell, Eric, tell the people kind of what the concept is
[time=173] as to how they could join us in running this fall and in the process, really help save lives through clean water in Africa.
[time=182] Yeah, the most common question we get is, do I have to be a runner to participate?
[time=187] Somebody like me would ask that question.
[time=189] Right, exactly. And you did. You tried.
[time=191] But no, you don't have to be a runner.
[time=193] What you need is the willingness to step out of your comfort zone.
[time=197] Yeah. And a desire to help people in need.
[time=199] Nice. And that's pretty much it.
[time=201] Nice. If you have those two, then we can take care of the rest.
[time=204] Fantastic. Road vision has put together a great running program.
[time=208] Yeah. For new runners who may have never ran before.
[time=212] Gotcha. So, it's about an 18-week program, but it'll help them get them across the finish line.
[time=217] Well, what we're going to do is we're going to put an email address at the bottom of the screen here and we're going to invite you and we're going to invite people in our own family and we're inviting people from other church and ministry families to join us this spring as the training begins with September in view.
[time=235] And I'm so thankful for Eric. Thankful for his leadership here.
[time=238] This email that you're going to see at the bottom of the screen is an email that you could write into.
[time=242] And as you write into this email address, then we'll make sure you get the appropriate information
[time=248] to kind of register, get your own website, start the process of going to people
[time=255] and asking them for support. It's going to be a great several months as we all try to get ready for the -- there's the half marathon.
[time=263] Half marathon. The 10K. There's the 10K. It's 6.2 and a 4-mile.
[time=267] And a 4-mile. What did I do last year?
[time=269] I think you did the 4-mile. I walked. I walked and jogged the 4-mile.
[time=273] You're doing the half this year, right? I don't know what I'm doing.
[time=275] But we're really thankful for the chance to honor Dan and to do our best to help those in need.
[time=280] Thank you so much for tuning in. Thanks for being a part of our family.
[time=283] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=285] I don't know where you're at when you came to the door this morning.
[time=292] It could have been a really great week. It could have been a great month.
[time=296] It could have been really awful. You could feel like that you're right in the midst of your failure.
[time=301] Maybe there's some things you've been struggling with over and over and over.
[time=306] And what's great is we're here here in Romans 5 and it doesn't really matter.
[time=313] Whatever moment that we decide to open that door and say, "God, here I am." This is what I got. We find that his door is already open and he's staying there waiting.
[time=324] So we want to sing that this morning. We want to sing "Take You" as you find me.
[time=331] Take me as you find me. All my fears and failures fill my life again.
[time=342] I give my life to follow everything I believe in.
[time=349] Now I surrender.
[time=358] Sing, Lord. He can do the mountains.
[time=363] My God is mighty to sing. He is mighty to sing forever.
[time=372] Author of salvation. He rose in knock and convey.
[time=378] Jesus conquered the same single. He can do the mountains.
[time=386] My God is mighty to sing. He is mighty to sing forever.
[time=395] Author of salvation. He rose in conquer the grave.
[time=401] Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=408] All right, shall you lie? We're going to sing.
[time=417] Shall you lie and let the whole world sing?
[time=422] We're singing for the glory of the risen King.
[time=428] Jesus, shall you lie and let the whole world sing?
[time=434] We're singing for the glory of the risen King.
[time=441] Shall you lie and let the whole world sing?
[time=446] We're singing for the glory of the risen King.
[time=452] Jesus, shall you lie and let the whole world sing?
[time=457] We're singing for the glory of the risen King.
[time=463] I say, Lord. He can do the mountains.
[time=469] My God is mighty to sing. He is mighty to sing forever.
[time=477] Author of salvation. He rose in conquer the grave.
[time=484] Jesus conquered the same single. He can do the mountains.
[time=492] My God is mighty to sing. He is mighty to sing forever.
[time=501] Author of salvation. He rose in conquer the grave.
[time=507] Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=518] [APPLAUSE]
[time=532] As morning dawns and evening fades,
[time=538] you inspire songs of grace.
[time=544] Arise from earth to touch your heart
[time=550] and glorify your name.
[time=555] In your name is the strong in my tower, your name.
[time=565] Is the shelter like the world in your name?
[time=571] Let the nation sing you louder, because nothing has the power to say, but your name.
[time=586] [MUSIC]
[time=593] Jesus, in your name we pray.
[time=598] Come and fill our hearts today
[time=604] and give us strength to live for you
[time=610] and glorify your name.
[time=616] In your name is the strong in my tower, your name.
[time=625] Is the shelter like the world in your name?
[time=631] Let the nation sing you louder, because nothing has the power to say, but your name.
[time=643] [MUSIC]
[time=666] See your name together, here we go.
[time=668] In your name is the strong in my tower, your name.
[time=678] Is the shelter like the world in your name?
[time=684] Let the nation sing you louder, because nothing has the power to say, but your name is the strong in my tower, your name.
[time=702] Is the shelter like the world in your name?
[time=708] Let the nation sing you louder, because nothing has the power to say, but your name is the strong in my tower, your name.
[time=721] There's nothing has the power to say, but your name.
[time=731] [MUSIC]
[time=741] [APPLAUSE]
[time=746] Hey, good to be together this morning for what is week four, chapter four, in our study of the book of Jonah, which opened your Bibles to the Old Testament, to the book of Jonah.
[time=759] We started out here a few weeks ago in chapter one.
[time=763] I wanted it just before we get to chapter four.
[time=765] I want to just make sure real quick everybody in the room, we can do this together, just a quick review of where we've been so far, chapters one, two, and three.
[time=774] Many of you from what we've heard from the conversations that we've had, the texts and the emails that you've sent.
[time=781] Many of you took us up on the invitation to read through the book of Jonah on a daily basis.
[time=787] Many of you more than once a day.
[time=789] Well done. Good job. I hope it's been.
[time=791] I know from many of you, it's been a real encouragement.
[time=795] I've had a blast.
[time=796] We as a team have had a great time thinking through this book and teaching it week after week.
[time=801] I was there week one.
[time=802] Steve Webster came week two.
[time=804] Jesse Hannah was here last week, and now I get to finish it up.
[time=807] But what was chapter one about?
[time=810] And if you weren't here or you don't know, we can just kind of help you real quick here.
[time=814] In your own words, if you were going to just kind of summarize it, what's chapter one of Jonah about?
[time=823] There you go. Good.
[time=825] Yeah, chapter one of Jonah is God says, we tell you to do this all the time.
[time=829] God told Jonah to what?
[time=831] Go. And Jonah said what?
[time=834] No. So that's chapter one.
[time=836] Chapter one of Jonah is God told Jonah to go to Nineveh.
[time=841] Nineveh was in need of repentance.
[time=844] Nineveh needed the gospel.
[time=846] It needed the truth.
[time=847] It needed to come to Jesus.
[time=850] It needed help.
[time=851] God tells Jonah to go.
[time=853] Jonah doesn't like Nineveh.
[time=855] Jonah doesn't want Nineveh to be saved.
[time=858] Jonah says no.
[time=860] Goes and gets on a ship off.
[time=862] He goes to not Nineveh.
[time=864] Jonah, Tarsus.
[time=866] Chapter two, he's in the belly of a what?
[time=870] A big fish.
[time=872] Remember we said, we said get direct TV.
[time=876] Obey God don't end up in the belly of a fish.
[time=879] He ends up in the belly of a fish.
[time=881] And chapter two is basically Jonah saying, God, I'm what?
[time=885] I'm sorry.
[time=887] God, I'm sorry.
[time=888] Should have gone.
[time=889] Don't want to be here.
[time=891] I'll go.
[time=892] Chapter one is go, no.
[time=894] Chapter two is, I'm sorry I didn't go.
[time=897] I'll go.
[time=898] Chapter three, he goes.
[time=901] Chapter three, Jonah goes to Nineveh.
[time=905] Huge city, evil place.
[time=908] We documented that for you.
[time=910] It was an awful place filled with evil.
[time=913] A city so big it would take three days to walk across it.
[time=917] He goes one day in and you saw there in chapter three, God proclaims his brief but powerful message.
[time=924] He calls Nineveh to repentance and they what?
[time=928] They repent.
[time=930] Nineveh, the king, the rulers, the officials, the people.
[time=935] They put, they're animals.
[time=938] They mean everybody turns and moves in a different direction.
[time=944] Massive repentance.
[time=947] God's work is done.
[time=949] God's purposes are accomplished.
[time=952] And then what do we see in chapter four?
[time=955] You know what chapter four is about?
[time=957] I mean, we eat it to you.
[time=958] It's very rare that we get to read a chapter together.
[time=961] But these are all pretty short.
[time=963] Would you in honor of God's word, would you stand if you can?
[time=966] If not, you can be seated.
[time=968] Open up your tablets.
[time=969] Get your phone out.
[time=970] Your Bible, whatever it is you're using to look at the scriptures.
[time=973] Follow along what an honor it is for me to read this to you.
[time=976] Jonah chapter four.
[time=978] And actually you can't really start for one without reading three ten.
[time=984] When God saw their deeds, their deeds of repentance.
[time=987] Nineveh, that they turned from their wicked way.
[time=990] Then God relented concerning the calamity, the judgment which he had declared.
[time=995] He would bring upon them and he did not, it says there, he did not do it.
[time=1002] But it greatly, chapter four, verse one, but it greatly displeased Jonah.
[time=1007] And he became angry.
[time=1009] He prayed to the Lord and said, please, Lord, was not this what I said while I was still
[time=1015] in my own country.
[time=1017] Therefore, in order to forestall this, I fled to Tarsus for I knew that you were
[time=1024] a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abundant in loving kindness and one who relents concerning calamity.
[time=1031] Therefore now, oh Lord, please, take my life from me.
[time=1035] For death is better to me than life.
[time=1039] Then the Lord said, do you have good reason to be angry?
[time=1045] He looks at Jonah and says, really?
[time=1049] What are you thinking?
[time=1051] Then Jonah went out from the city, verse five, and sat east of it.
[time=1056] And he made a shelter for himself and sat under it in the shade until he could see what would happen in the city.
[time=1063] So the Lord appointed a plant.
[time=1065] The Lord did and grew it up over Jonah to be a shade over his head to deliver him
[time=1072] from his discomfort.
[time=1074] And Jonah was extremely, everybody say that word out loud.
[time=1078] Happy.
[time=1079] Now he's happy.
[time=1080] Jonah was extremely happy about the plant, but God appointed a worm.
[time=1084] And John came the next day and it attacked the plant and it withered the plant gone.
[time=1089] When the sun came up, God appointed a scorching east wind and the sun beat down on Jonah's
[time=1095] head so that he became faint and begged with all of his soul to die.
[time=1100] Now he's not happy, saying, death is better to me than life.
[time=1104] Then God said to Jonah, you're an idiot.
[time=1107] No, he didn't say that.
[time=1109] God said to Jonah, do you have good reason to be angry about the plant?
[time=1114] And he said, I have good reason to be angry, even to death.
[time=1118] A mad, verse 10, then the Lord said, the Lord said, you had compassion on the plant.
[time=1128] For which you did not work.
[time=1131] And for which you did not cause to grow, which came up overnight and perished overnight, should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city in which there are more than 120,000
[time=1144] persons who do not know the difference between their right and left hand as well as many
[time=1151] animals.
[time=1153] Our Father in heaven, we pray right now that you would in ways only you can, that you would
[time=1160] make these words, that you would take the truth of the Scriptures this morning and make
[time=1166] a difference in our hearts and our lives, God in the way we live and the way we think and
[time=1172] the way we respond, not just to each other, but oh God the way in which we respond to you.
[time=1179] May Jonah's response to you.
[time=1183] May his interaction here with you, God, may it be an example, may it be a lesson for us.
[time=1191] May we change the things that need to be changed.
[time=1194] God, may we repent of those things that we need to repent of.
[time=1199] May we see you in a different light and oh God, may you continue to exercise your graciousness
[time=1206] and your compassion, your loving kindness and your readiness to relent with us.
[time=1214] God, we need that.
[time=1215] We're thankful for it.
[time=1217] Give us grace as we study this morning in your son's name, we pray, amen.
[time=1221] You can be seated.
[time=1223] You know what Jonah 4 is about.
[time=1226] Jonah 4 is a sad, pathetic picture of what happens sometimes in the hearts of sinful
[time=1233] men, sinful men like you, sinful men like me.
[time=1238] Jonah 4 is a sad, pathetic picture of what happens in the hearts of men who should know better when what God does isn't what they wanted.
[time=1251] Jonah 4 is a pathetic picture of what happens in the heart of sinful men when God does what they don't want.
[time=1259] Has God ever done what you didn't want?
[time=1265] Has God ever allowed something that wasn't on your agenda?
[time=1269] Has God ever been behind something clearly and you stand back and think to yourself what
[time=1275] in the world God are you doing?
[time=1279] This chapter gives us some very personal, very honest insights into the warped mindset
[time=1287] of Jonah while giving us great insight into the merciful mindset of God.
[time=1295] We will look today at the warped mindset of Jonah while at the same time I think receiving
[time=1301] great insights into the merciful mindset of God.
[time=1304] Let's start this morning with the warped mindset of Jonah, some might say twisted mindset,
[time=1310] some might say extremely hard-hearted mindset.
[time=1314] He really was messed up as we read chapters one, two, three and now four you realize this guy had issues.
[time=1321] Very stubborn and quite honestly, very rebellious.
[time=1324] If you were going to write down a word this morning as we start, I'd write that one down.
[time=1328] Jonah was a very rebellious individual.
[time=1332] You go back to chapter one, if you weren't here, let's catch you up real quick.
[time=1337] You see this rebelliousness, you see this stubbornness, you see this warped mindset all through the book.
[time=1343] Go back to chapter one verse 11.
[time=1345] It says there in chapter one verse 11 as the waves are coming over the edge of the boat
[time=1351] as the storm is raging, the skies are coming undone.
[time=1354] So they said to him in verse 11 of chapter one, "What should we do to you that the sea may become calm for us, for the sea was becoming increasingly stormy." He said to them verse 12, "Pick me up and throw me into the sea.
[time=1369] Then the sea will become calm for you, for I know that on account of me this great storm
[time=1376] has come." Jonah saying there, "This is all my fault.
[time=1381] This is all happening," listen, "this is all happening because of my sin.
[time=1387] This is all happening because of my iniquity.
[time=1390] This is all happening because of my stubborn, messed up, rebellious heart.
[time=1397] And as soon as you deal with me, throw me over the edge, kill me, and this whole thing
[time=1405] will go away." Do you ever notice that he didn't say, because he could have, he could have said because he
[time=1413] knew what was going on.
[time=1415] He could have said, "Time out, hang on, he got down on his knees right there in the boat
[time=1424] and he could have ended it.
[time=1426] He could have just said, "God, I'm what, I'm sorry."
[time=1432] He could have just gotten on his knees and he could have just said, "I give, I'm so sorry.
[time=1443] Give me, I'll go.
[time=1445] You're right.
[time=1446] I'm a fool." But he doesn't.
[time=1451] He says, "In essence, I'd rather take the calamity than confess.
[time=1457] I would rather die at the bottom of the ocean than repent.
[time=1462] Throw me into the sea.
[time=1464] I'm not going to say.
[time=1465] I'm sorry." It just, it leads me this morning to have to ask you and I've got to ask myself, we've
[time=1473] got to be people who are willing to ask these kinds of questions.
[time=1477] What sin in your life are you that committed to?
[time=1486] What sin, what iniquity, what rebellion in your life are you that committed to that you're
[time=1494] just going to hang on to it?
[time=1499] You're going to float to the bottom of the ocean with it.
[time=1504] You're going to experience all the calamity that's going to come with it.
[time=1512] Stubborn dude, man, he was really, really stubborn.
[time=1519] Steve Webster pointed it out two weeks ago, the stubbornness, this rebellion.
[time=1526] Remember the stubbornness of Jonah in the belly of the giant fish?
[time=1530] It was somewhat subtle, but it was there.
[time=1533] Let's just make sure we look at it one more time here.
[time=1535] Look at chapter two, verse one, the stubbornness of Jonah in the fish.
[time=1541] Actually, you can't see this in two one until you read one seventeen.
[time=1545] So let's read one seventeen together.
[time=1548] Let me read it to you.
[time=1549] It says, "And the Lord appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah." So Jonah gets swallowed by a big fish, and Jonah was in the stomach of the fish.
[time=1561] Everybody in the whole room read this out loud together with me now, three days and three nights.
[time=1567] Say it one more time, three days and three nights.
[time=1571] Imagine you going down the esophagus of a fish.
[time=1577] Sitting in its gut and sitting there for three days and three nights, and then three days
[time=1583] and three nights, and then look at the first word of chapter two, verse one.
[time=1588] What's the first word?
[time=1591] What?
[time=1592] Then three days and three nights.
[time=1599] I would, I would like to think I would have been screaming Jesus' name on the way down the throat, right?
[time=1606] And I'm a pretty stubborn dude.
[time=1608] I would have been begging for help.
[time=1610] Are you kidding me?
[time=1611] I'm in a fish, three days, three days and three nights, then.
[time=1625] Then Jonah prayed to the Lord.
[time=1629] It really is human sinful nature at times, isn't it?
[time=1633] Sometimes we just don't want to come clean.
[time=1638] Sometimes I wrote this down.
[time=1639] I hope you will.
[time=1640] I hope you'll take note of this, we had people tweeting at first hour.
[time=1646] It really is just good, I think, to hang on to this.
[time=1648] Sometimes prideful rebellion seems more inviting than soft-hearted humility.
[time=1656] And not only do I want you to write that down, please do that.
[time=1660] Sometimes prideful rebellion seems more inviting than soft-hearted humility.
[time=1669] So having written that down, and I hope you did, here's what I want to say to you.
[time=1673] I want to say to every one of you this, why?
[time=1678] And I want you to answer that.
[time=1680] I'm going to just give you a moment to at least just think about that.
[time=1685] I believe that that statement's true.
[time=1688] I think most of you would agree that that statement's true.
[time=1691] That there are times in your life when prideful iniquity, when hard-hearted rebellion against
[time=1697] what you know is true and right and good, somehow seems more inviting than a soft-hearted
[time=1707] humility that leads to obedience.
[time=1709] Here's the question, I want you to answer this.
[time=1712] You're on your own.
[time=1713] You want to share it with me, you can, why?
[time=1718] Why is it that way in you?
[time=1725] What goes on in your mind?
[time=1727] What thoughts do you somehow walk on to that make that such a common thing?
[time=1737] And so there we sit, arms folded in our mess in the smelly bile of the great fishes guts
[time=1748] with the days and nights passing by.
[time=1755] Look at Jonah's warped mindset at the beginning of chapter 4.
[time=1759] Here we see it again.
[time=1761] After 4, 1 to 4, it greatly, the repentance of a greatly displeased Jonah, and he became
[time=1768] angry.
[time=1769] He prayed angry.
[time=1770] He prayed to the Lord and said, "Lord, was not this what I said while I was still in my own country, therefore, in order to forestall this I fled, for I knew that you were a gracious
[time=1779] and compassionate God, slow to anger and abundant and loving kindness, and one who relents concerning calamity, judgment, your wrath, therefore now, O Lord, please take my life."
[time=1791] For death is better to me than life, the Lord said, "Do you have good reason to be angry?"
[time=1797] Two things I want you to take note of this morning, I hope you will, two things under this warped, rebellious mindset of Jonah.
[time=1806] First of all, I want you to look with me at the word forestall.
[time=1811] You see it there in the text in verse 2, this is exactly what I thought would happen,
[time=1817] therefore, verse 2, therefore, in order to forestall this I fled, detartious, for I knew
[time=1825] that you were a gracious and compassionate God.
[time=1828] It's Jonah saying, "God, I knew you would do exactly what you wanted to do.
[time=1832] God, I knew at the end of the day your plan, your will, your character, your desires would
[time=1839] win out." So I forestalled is the word he uses.
[time=1847] Question for you, you with me, question, does he say so I sought to squelch your plan?
[time=1858] Does he say that he tried to squelch God's plan?
[time=1861] Yes or no?
[time=1862] No.
[time=1864] Does it say so I knew what you were going to do, so I tried to negate your agenda?
[time=1869] Does it say that?
[time=1873] No.
[time=1874] Why?
[time=1875] Why doesn't it say that?
[time=1877] Why does it say so I tried to forestall interesting?
[time=1885] So I tried to forestall means any attempt to delay an effort to slow or halt progress,
[time=1895] any attempt to delay an effort to slow or halt progress.
[time=1902] What does the use of the word forestall in Jonah 4 here?
[time=1906] What does it tell you about Jonah?
[time=1909] What does it tell you about what Jonah really, truly, honestly believes deep down in his
[time=1915] soul about God's plans?
[time=1919] You know what it tells us?
[time=1921] It tells us the same thing about what you and you and you and all of you up there believe
[time=1929] and all of you over here, it tells us the same thing about what you believe regarding
[time=1936] God's plans and it tells us all the same thing I believe.
[time=1940] Same thing I know about God's plans because we're all Jonas.
[time=1948] We're all Jonas.
[time=1949] What it is, here's what it tells us, even in our rebellion, Jonah knew deep down inside.
[time=1956] Even in our rebellion, we know deep down inside God's ways will always prevail.
[time=1963] You know that.
[time=1965] I know that.
[time=1966] In our stubbornness, we don't win, we never will.
[time=1971] Question for you church.
[time=1972] When's the last time you and your rebellion won?
[time=1976] When?
[time=1977] When was it?
[time=1978] When you and your rebellion won?
[time=1981] You beat God.
[time=1983] He lost and you won, win.
[time=1986] You're kidding me?
[time=1988] You're over 9 million.
[time=1992] If we were managing a ball club, we would get fired.
[time=1996] We're managing our lives, we should all get laid off.
[time=1998] We're horrible at it.
[time=1999] We lose every time.
[time=2002] We know that, in our prideful arrogance, we don't win, God wins, always.
[time=2013] He will break us, He will draw us to Himself, He will whisper, sometimes He yells.
[time=2020] But yet we sometimes like to think that we can prolong the charade, that we can forestall
[time=2027] now and then be inevitable.
[time=2031] What we all know, we all know God will win the day.
[time=2038] So here's my question for you.
[time=2040] You bunch of Jonah's.
[time=2045] Why keep running away?
[time=2049] Why in the world would you forestall what you know down deep in your soul is true that
[time=2056] God's ways lead to victory, that God's path leads to life.
[time=2062] Why keep running away from your marriage challenges?
[time=2068] Why keep running away toward empty addictions that are ruining, ruining your life and the
[time=2076] lives of those you love?
[time=2079] Why keep running away toward greed, toward spiritual laziness and the list goes on and
[time=2086] on?
[time=2087] Why do you continue to choose rebellion when you know down deep inside what Jonah knew?
[time=2094] It won't work.
[time=2102] Choose flash, good news, flash.
[time=2107] You can stop it.
[time=2110] All the heartache that's coming, all the calamity that's starting, all the waves that are starting to make their way over the side of your ship, you can't stop it.
[time=2119] You don't have to continue to bring all of this upon you.
[time=2123] Say, God, I'm what?
[time=2128] I'm sorry.
[time=2130] I'm so sorry for my prideful, sinful rebellion.
[time=2137] I'm so sorry for trying to do this my way.
[time=2141] You're right, God.
[time=2142] I've been foolish.
[time=2144] No more me trying to forestall the inevitable.
[time=2149] I want to live in obedience.
[time=2151] I want to live in relationship with you, God.
[time=2156] Put a warped mindset He had and look at all that He had to endure.
[time=2163] Look at all that happened.
[time=2164] You read through these four chapters and you realize humility.
[time=2170] Humility could have saved so much.
[time=2176] Second thing I want you to see under the heading of warped mindset of Jonah is the phrase found in verse 6.
[time=2184] You look at chapter 4 verse 6 and you see this phrase, it kind of jumps off the page because
[time=2190] we haven't seen a lot of this in Jonah, which is the point I'm going to make here in just a moment.
[time=2195] It says, so the Lord got appointed a plant and it grew up, maybe like the one behind me here on the stage, and it grew up over Jonah to be a shade over his head, to deliver him
[time=2206] from his discomfort, circumstantially, things got better.
[time=2211] And it says there in verse 6 of chapter 4, Jonah was extremely what?
[time=2216] Say it, church, happy.
[time=2219] Jonah was extremely happy.
[time=2224] Okay wait a minute, three verses ago, he's in the absolute anguish of his sinful rage
[time=2232] against the Lord.
[time=2233] He's angry with God.
[time=2235] He doesn't like God.
[time=2236] He wants to die.
[time=2237] He's so ticked off.
[time=2239] He chapters ago, he utterly bales on God, runs in the different direction.
[time=2247] And as we've read so much, I want you to see this, so much of Jonah's rebellion, so much of his sour countenance, his bad attitude, have been tied.
[time=2257] Note this, to circumstantial setting issues.
[time=2263] God's asking him to go somewhere, he doesn't want to go.
[time=2271] It's going to be difficult, it's going to be stretching, it's going to be hard, it's going to require a great deal.
[time=2277] It might be painful, it might ask for a great deal from him.
[time=2282] You see, circumstantially, as it relates to the setting, he again and again and again
[time=2288] shows himself to be conditional in his willingness to follow.
[time=2295] Now here in chapter 4, it's almost like God's just messing with him.
[time=2299] Really, I read chapter 4, the whole plant thing, it feels like God's just toying with him.
[time=2304] Here, I'll give you a plant, the plant will give you shade.
[time=2306] How do you like that?
[time=2307] Now I'm happy, boom, plant gone.
[time=2311] Now how you doing?
[time=2313] Now I'm not happy, now I want to die again, that's my point.
[time=2318] And I think that's the point for you and for me this morning.
[time=2323] Think about what Jonah missed out on, because he missed the whole mindset of Romans 5.
[time=2329] Would you turn to Romans 5?
[time=2334] Look at this great truth, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, go to Romans chapter 5
[time=2341] and look at verses 3 through 5.
[time=2345] Here is a biblical way to navigate circumstantial challenge.
[time=2352] That's calling you, he's calling me, he wants us to move in this direction.
[time=2356] Now all of a sudden it gets a little dicey, now all of a sudden it gets a little hot.
[time=2360] Now all of a sudden here comes some discomfort, here comes some challenge, here comes some circumstances that are going to push you, test you, and Romans 5, 3 to 5, Paul says here's
[time=2372] how you do that.
[time=2374] And not only this, but we also, verse 3, but we also exalt in our tribulations.
[time=2382] Exalt doesn't mean complain, exalt doesn't mean run, exalt means to lift up, it means
[time=2389] to be grateful for, it means to embrace, we exalt in our tribulations knowing that tribulation
[time=2396] brings about perseverance, and knowing perseverance brings about proven character, and proven
[time=2404] character brings about hope, and hope does not disappoint because the love of God through
[time=2411] all of that process, the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy
[time=2417] Spirit who was given to us when we're willing to exalt in our tribulations, knowing they
[time=2423] bring about perseverance, knowing they produce character, and knowing character leads you and me to hope.
[time=2431] Don't forget church, don't forget my friends, serving and following after God isn't synonymous
[time=2440] with the American dream, sometimes it's good to just be reminded of this.
[time=2446] I'm as thankful as anybody in this room for our country, I'm as grateful as anybody in
[time=2452] this room for the places in which our faith kind of intersects with this great opportunity
[time=2458] God has given us in this great nation of ours.
[time=2460] I'm good with all of that, but please understand God never promised you, God isn't about liberty
[time=2467] and the pursuit of happiness, and is not his foundational aim with you, that you would
[time=2474] be happy, God's foundational aim with you is that you would be holy, that you would be
[time=2483] different, that you would be separate, that there would be a character to you, an integrity
[time=2490] in our lives that separates us from the norm.
[time=2496] God promises to bring you things, listen God promises to bring things into your life that
[time=2504] will require you to endure, Bible says it, God promises to bring into your life things
[time=2512] that will require you to persevere, God promises to bring into your life things that will call
[time=2520] you to survive with his help and by his grace and with his strength.
[time=2527] This is what God promises and it will never equate to, it will never produce the kind
[time=2534] of fruit in your life and mind that he designed it to if our mindsets are warped, if our vision
[time=2542] and our thoughts are skewed by rebellion.
[time=2547] That's in this morning with the merciful mindset of God.
[time=2550] We've seen the warped mindset of Jonah, look at the merciful mindset of God.
[time=2555] Look at Jonah 4 verses 9 through 11, a very interesting passage.
[time=2562] And when you read it, it's good to read it a couple, two or three times, like many of you have over the last several weeks, it's just some things I want to try and explain to you quickly, then God said verse 9, then God said to Jonah, do you have good reason to be angry about the plant, and Jonah said, yeah, I've got good reason to be angry even to death, then the Lord said, wait, you had compassion on the plant for which you did not work and which you did not cause to grow, which came up overnight and perished overnight, in other words, you had nothing to do with the plant.
[time=2593] Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, which I made, I created it, every life in it,
[time=2602] was made in the image of me.
[time=2605] Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know the difference between their right and left hand, as well as many
[time=2617] animals?
[time=2618] Now, what does all this mean?
[time=2620] Listen, I'm going to read from my note here, God's love for the people of Nineveh, whom
[time=2626] he had created himself, is far different from Jonah's indifference to their potential damnation
[time=2635] and greater than Jonah's warped concern for a wild plant for which he had done nothing.
[time=2643] Think back in the Old Testament, God was ready to spare Sodom and Gomorrah for how many righteous.
[time=2649] Do you remember?
[time=2650] Ten, he was going to spare that whole, depraved, awful, wretched place for ten.
[time=2661] How much more?
[time=2663] How much more would he withhold for a city which includes 120,000 small children?
[time=2671] Did you get that?
[time=2673] Who doesn't know the difference between their right and their left?
[time=2677] Adults?
[time=2678] No.
[time=2679] No, this is a biblical reference, I believe, to a segment of that city.
[time=2687] Here we see our God exercising his great heart and evidencing this great mercy for those
[time=2696] who don't even know the difference between their right and left, 120,000 two-year-olds and three-year-olds, four-year-olds.
[time=2707] With that many two or three-year-olds, it's reasonable to expect a total population in excess of 600,000 people.
[time=2716] Now there are times in the Old Testament, there are times today, my friends, when God's wrath is severe and harsh.
[time=2724] I have people, many of you maybe even have experienced this, I have people who read through the Old Testament and they come to me and they say, "What's the deal with God?
[time=2732] He's like so angry in the Old Testament." It seems like he's just like flattening people and wiping out the sinful and there's death
[time=2742] and there's destruction and I say to them, "That's true.
[time=2746] There is that.
[time=2748] There is a side of God that holds high, the righteous standard of holiness, his righteous
[time=2754] standard," there are times when God exercises, yes, drastic and severe judgment against
[time=2762] sinfulness, sinfulness that deserves judgment.
[time=2767] There's times God does that.
[time=2770] But I stand here today and I proclaim to all of you here in this room, those of you watching
[time=2776] online, this is an instance where he didn't.
[time=2781] This is an instance where the God of the Old Testament shows the other side, the side
[time=2787] of mercy, the side of compassion, the side of grace.
[time=2790] You say why?
[time=2791] I say, "I don't know.
[time=2793] I don't understand how all that works in each and every circumstance." What I do know is that Jonah was absolutely right in verse two.
[time=2802] Remember, I've taught you over the years when you don't understand some things, you always default to what you do know.
[time=2809] And what we do know is that what it says in verse two is right.
[time=2813] When Jonah says in verse two, "I knew you were a gracious and compassionate God, he is."
[time=2819] Slow to anger and abundant and loving kindness he is, he is, my friends.
[time=2825] He is one who relents concerning calamity, judgment, wrath.
[time=2831] Jonah was right in describing God that way and I want to say to you this morning that what I'm reminded of today as I read this to you, what I'm reminded of today as we look at this together, and I want you to hear this loud and clear.
[time=2842] God wants to, in God's heart, in his nature, in his character, God wants to save people.
[time=2850] He really, truly does.
[time=2851] He wants to save people who are in trouble.
[time=2856] God wants to spare people who are going down a road that he's very aware of where it leads.
[time=2863] He knows exactly where the edge of that cliff is.
[time=2866] He knows what's at the bottom of that ravine.
[time=2870] He wants to spare you.
[time=2873] That's exactly what he does here to the people of Nineveh.
[time=2878] I want you to be reminded this morning that our God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of the Bible, the God of our faith, the one who we follow, he wants to relent at times.
[time=2889] When it comes to judgment, and when it comes to wrath, when it comes to calamity, God wants
[time=2897] to exercise compassion.
[time=2904] And so I don't know, I understand sin's struggle.
[time=2910] I'm with you in that, and I understand the pull at times.
[time=2916] But I am this morning so grateful for what Jesse pointed out to us last week, so thankful
[time=2922] for his grace, and so thankful that everything Jonah said about him is true, and that kindness
[time=2930] and that compassionate spirit and that willingness to relent is something that I have seen with
[time=2937] my own eyes, and I would offer it to you this morning.
[time=2940] I'm going to ask Adam and the team to come, and I want to close this morning in an opportunity where you and I can worship this gracious, compassionate God, but I want you to worship
[time=2951] him this morning.
[time=2952] Please don't leave, and not only don't leave, but as we stand, I pray that you'll worship him this morning with your rebellion and your iniquity and this tendency in you, Jonah,
[time=2969] to move away from that which down deep inside you know is right.
[time=2973] And so I would just invite you this morning, would you just stand right now and would you just in the quietness of your heart, would you kind of look yourself in the mirror in a sense, and that rebellion and that stubbornness, will you allow that to just sit there in front
[time=2987] of you for a few moments, and at the same time will you lift up these great truths that
[time=2993] say so much to you and to me about the work that's been done to conquer that very, that
[time=3002] very rebellion and sinfulness.
[time=3003] Let's sing.
[time=3004] Let's worship our God together in spirit and in truth.
[time=3377] If there's any stubbornness, this warped mindset that
[time=3383] likes to just go down these roads that you and I know down deep in our hearts don't work.
[time=3391] If there's any rebelling in you, I want to pray for you.
[time=3395] And if there is, I just want you to raise your hand.
[time=3400] And first hour, I said, bow your heads and close your eyes.
[time=3405] It's kind of a habit some of us get into, which is okay.
[time=3409] I think there's a place for that.
[time=3411] This hour, I'm going to just do it this way.
[time=3414] You can keep your heads up.
[time=3417] Is there anybody in the room at all that struggles with rebellion
[time=3423] and the struggle of Jonah?
[time=3426] [AMEN] And now would you bow your heads?
[time=3431] And let me pray for those of you who raised your hands, which I think was the whole room.
[time=3437] Our Father in Heaven, we come to you this morning and I bring this family who I love and I care for.
[time=3443] God, we're so thankful that we get to help love and lead and shepherd these dear people, young and old and everybody in between.
[time=3451] And God, this morning I pray, that the spirit of God and the word of God and the people of God would come alongside and into these friends of mine.
[time=3460] And would you give them great strength, God, beyond themselves, to live apart from their rebellion.
[time=3466] God, to live and humble humility and obedience.
[time=3471] Not disobedience.
[time=3472] God, may they say yes to you this week.
[time=3476] May they cry out the name of the Lord Jesus.
[time=3480] May they rest in your strength and your power.
[time=3483] And may they go to whatever links they need to go to in order to repent.
[time=3489] God, thank you for the privilege of reading and studying and seeing what we've seen.
[time=3495] May the young men in this room and the young women in this room who faced God today, a culture that invites them moment by moment to rebellion.
[time=3505] God, may you give them extra strength.
[time=3508] And may we, as those who are mentoring and discipling and discipling and walking alongside them, may we God give them character and may we give them hope and may we give them strength and support as they walk alongside us in the days to come.
[time=3523] God, thank you for the privilege of worship this morning.
[time=3526] Thank you for the chance to open your word.
[time=3528] May you be with us as we go and bring us back together.
[time=3531] If that be your will.
[time=3532] And everybody agreed with the prayer and said amen.
[time=3535] God bless you.
