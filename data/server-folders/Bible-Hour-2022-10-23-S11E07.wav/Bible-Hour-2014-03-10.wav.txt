[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] From the highest room to the earth's below, you lay down your life for the likes of us.
[time=48] Great is the love of the Saviour, from a wounded heart to a loud-made whole, every human heart will declare as one.
[time=65] Great is the love of the Saviour, Lord of endless light, let you glory shine
[time=78] forever, all the earth, all the earth will sing your praise.
[time=92] From the mountain heights to the valley's low, all created things, given love to show Jesus will live for your glory.
[time=109] From the rising sun to still a night, every waking moment for your delight, Jesus will live for your glory.
[time=124] Lord of endless light, let your glory shine forever, all the earth, all the earth will sing your praise.
[time=141] Oh, Lord, every heart that you'll make, you'll lay down your higher, all the hearts, all the hearts to sing your praise.
[time=158] God be tortured, God be tortured in everything. We live for your glory, live for your glory.
[time=206] Lord of endless light, let your glory shine forever, all the earth, all the earth will sing your praise.
[time=222] Oh, Lord, every heart that you'll make, you'll lay down your higher, all the hearts, all the hearts to sing your praise.
[time=239] God be tortured, God be tortured in everything. We live for your glory, live for your glory.
[time=286] My foes are many, their eyes against me, but I will hold my ground.
[time=301] I will not feel the war, I will not feel storm, my help is on the way, my help is on the way.
[time=314] Oh, my God, He will not delay, my refuge and strength awaits.
[time=327] I will not fear, His promise is true, my God will come through, awaits, awaits.
[time=344] I will not feel the war, I will not feel storm, my help is on the way.
[time=359] I will not feel the war, I will not feel storm, my help is on the way, my help is on the way, oh, my God, He will not delay, my refuge and strength awaits.
[time=388] I will not fear, His promise is true, my God will come through, awaits, awaits.
[time=418] I live my eyes up, my help comes from the Lord.
[time=468] Oh, my God, He will not delay, my refuge and strength awaits.
[time=481] I will not fear, His promise is true, my God will come through, awaits, okay, my help.
[time=495] I live my eyes up, my help comes from the Lord.
[time=523] I want to continue sing that this morning, I'm going to teach you a new song.
[time=533] Talk to how our God is faithful, how He can be counted on, how He has a history of being counted on, and doing what He says.
[time=546] And the Lord our God is ever faithful, never changing through the ages.
[time=560] They would darkness, He will lead us, and forever we will say, "You're the Lord our God."
[time=574] And the Lord our God is ever faithful, never changing through the ages.
[time=591] For on this darkness you will lead us, and forever we will say, "You're the Lord our God."
[time=621] Promise maker, promise keeper, you finish what you begin.
[time=648] Our provision to the desert, you see through to the end, you see through.
[time=660] Oh, you see through to the end, come on the Lord our God.
[time=667] And the Lord our God is ever faithful, never changing through the ages.
[time=680] For on this darkness you will lead us, and forever we will say, "You're the Lord our God."
[time=699] And the silence and the waiting, still we can know you are good.
[time=711] All your plans are for your glory, oh yes we can know you are good, yes we can, oh yes we can know you are good.
[time=727] And the Lord our God is ever faithful, never changing through the ages.
[time=742] For on this darkness you will lead us, and forever we will say, "You're the Lord our God."
[time=760] All right, we're going to sing, "We Won't Move Without You." We want to tell God this morning that if there's a place that we want to go that He's not there, that we don't want to be there.
[time=771] We want to say that we don't know the best way, God, but you do know the best way.
[time=776] And we want to trust you with that, sing with me.
[time=779] And we won't move without you, we won't move without you.
[time=786] You're the light of all and all that we need, see now with me?
[time=791] And we won't move without you, no we won't move without you.
[time=798] You're the light of all and all that we need.
[time=802] We won't move without you, we won't move without you.
[time=810] You're the light of all and all that we need.
[time=815] And we won't move without you, no we won't move without you.
[time=822] You're the light of all and all that we need, see now with you.
[time=831] And the Lord our God is ever made of, never taken through the ages.
[time=844] From this darkness you will lead us, and forever we will save you.
[time=854] You're the Lord our God, and forever we will save you.
[time=866] You're the Lord our God.
[time=884] [APPLAUSE]
[time=889] God, we come to you this morning and we want this to be just more than a song that we sing.
[time=895] Not just words that come out, read them on the screen, repeat.
[time=901] Week after week we don't want to do that God.
[time=904] We want these songs to be prayers.
[time=907] We realize that there's a lot of strong things in there we're saying.
[time=910] That we don't want to go anywhere without you, that we trust you all the way.
[time=915] And it'd be naive to think that that's where everybody or hardly anyone is in this room in this moment God.
[time=922] So we want to now just warning that these are our prayers God, that we need you to teach us to do that.
[time=929] I need you to teach me to see where you are before I move.
[time=938] I need you to teach me to where there's something that my heart really, really wants to see if that's what you want, to see if that's where you are.
[time=948] And although there is an element of faith of stepping out and trusting God, it's not supposed to be totally blind.
[time=959] God, we ask you to show us, show us every day new ways that you can be trusted.
[time=969] With God, we pray that you have revealed to us times in the past where maybe we didn't even see it, but that you could be trusted.
[time=982] It's going to name it right, right, right, right, you can be seated.
[time=997] Well, good morning. It's good to be with you. If you have your Bibles turned to 2 Timothy.
[time=1005] For those of you who don't know me, my name is Josh Rang.
[time=1008] I have the privilege of being a part of the teaching team here at Blackhawk.
[time=1012] I am super excited about spring.
[time=1017] So all of you that might be a Chronicles of Narnia fan, Aslan is on the move.
[time=1025] So in my earnestness to help that go along, I've worn my spring attire this morning.
[time=1030] So that's what's going on. For those of you that don't know me, I grew up here at Blackhawk.
[time=1034] And again, I serve on the preaching team.
[time=1038] We're in between sermon series, leaving Jonah, heading into Mythbusters, which Steve will tell you a little bit more about later.
[time=1047] But Kelly has asked me to talk this morning from the scriptures about preaching the gospel to yourself.
[time=1054] And so that may be a phrase that you're familiar with. It may be a phrase that you're not familiar with, but this morning we'll explore that through what Paul says to Timothy in chapters 1 and 2 of 2 Timothy.
[time=1066] We've got a lot to cover, so buckle your seat belts and let's get rolling this morning.
[time=1072] So 2 Timothy, chapter 1, we're going to start in verse 8, and we're going to read to chapter 2, verse 13.
[time=1079] And notice this morning as we read, 2 Timothy is Paul's farewell speech to Timothy.
[time=1086] In chapter 4, it's evident that God has made known to Paul that his time to leave the earth and go to heaven is soon.
[time=1093] And so the context here of this book is Paul writing to Timothy to kind of give him his last and final encouragement,
[time=1102] his last and final words, his farewell speech.
[time=1105] So as we read this, notice the emphasis upon the gospel.
[time=1110] And so let's read this together this morning, starting in 2 Timothy chapter 1, verse 8.
[time=1116] Therefore, this is Paul speaking to Timothy, do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me his prisoner,
[time=1125] but share in the suffering for the gospel by the power of God, who saved us and called us to a holy calling,
[time=1132] not because of our works, but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began,
[time=1140] and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,
[time=1150] for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher, which is why I suffer as I do.
[time=1157] I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that he is able to guard until that day what has been entrusted to me.
[time=1167] Follow Timothy, the pattern of the sound words that you've heard from me in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus,
[time=1174] by the Holy Spirit who dwells within us, guard the good deposit entrusted to you.
[time=1181] You are aware that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Feigilis and Hermogenes,
[time=1187] may the Lord grant mercy to the household of Anessphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chains, but when he arrived in Rome, he searched for me earnestly and found me.
[time=1198] May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day, and you well know all the service he rendered at Ephesus.
[time=1206] You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus,
[time=1213] and what you've heard from me in the presence of many witnesses in trust of faithful men who will be able to teach others also.
[time=1221] Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus, no soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits,
[time=1228] since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him.
[time=1231] An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules.
[time=1235] It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops.
[time=1240] Think over what I say for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.
[time=1244] Verse 8, "Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead the offspring of David as preached in my gospel,
[time=1255] for which I'm suffering bound with chains as a criminal, but the word of God is not bound; for I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."
[time=1269] The saying is trustworthy, "For if we have died with him, we will also live with him; if we endure, we will also reign with him;
[time=1276] if we deny him, he also will deny us. If we are faithless, though, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself."
[time=1288] Again, this is Paul's farewell speech to Timothy.
[time=1293] John Stott commented on 2 Timothy in this in his commentary on 2 Timothy written in 1973.
[time=1302] He said this, "All around us we see Christians and churches relaxing their grasp on the gospel, fumbling it,
[time=1313] letting it drop from their hands altogether. And while we may think at odd to be charged to remember Jesus,
[time=1323] it seems like an odd charge, doesn't it? I mean, how can we forget him?
[time=1328] While we may think at odd, I can think of nothing better to occupy my thoughts on a consistent basis.
[time=1335] For as we will see, the person and work of Christ colors the way a Christian views God, sees himself, looks at humanity,
[time=1345] and understands the world we live in." George Orwell, an author back in the day, I don't think he was a Christian, he wrote Animal Farm 1984,
[time=1356] but he said this, and I think it's true, "The restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men."
[time=1366] So in the next 35 minutes, I want to do my best to restate the obvious again to us this morning
[time=1373] and help us all gain a better grasp on the gospel so that it could not be said of us,
[time=1380] that we are relaxing our grasp on the gospel, that it could not be said of us, that we're in danger of fumbling it
[time=1386] and letting it drop from our hands altogether.
[time=1391] So this morning, two main points that we'll look at, first of all, the need to remember Jesus.
[time=1399] Why do we need to remember Jesus? What's so important about it?
[time=1402] And then secondly, we'll try to get as practical as we can and think about some ways to remember Jesus.
[time=1409] So first, the why second, the how, so the need to remember Jesus and then secondly some ways to remember Jesus.
[time=1417] Let's pray.
[time=1419] Father, thank you so much for your word this morning.
[time=1421] Thank you for your grace upon grace, that you understand our frame, you understand our tendencies to forget.
[time=1432] And so in such a loving and gracious and tender way, you encourage us once again to remember your son Jesus.
[time=1441] Lord, we need you this morning, we need you to open our eyes, we need you to help us fight the temptation to say we've heard this before,
[time=1448] to fight the temptation to say I already know that.
[time=1452] And would your spirit just cause this truth to move in each of our hearts to help us gain a little bit more understanding of what your son has done and the implications of that for us?
[time=1469] We pray this in Christ's name, amen.
[time=1473] So why do we need to remember?
[time=1475] There's two reasons I think that come from 2 Timothy chapter 2 verse 8, there are two reasons that we need to remember because of the present implications of the historic reality of the gospel.
[time=1488] So in other words, the gospel was a historic reality, Calvary happened and there are present implications from that historical reality.
[time=1499] So let's take a look at that first, because of the present implications of the historic reality.
[time=1504] First, this idea of the gospel being historic.
[time=1507] Understand this, the cross is timeless.
[time=1511] The cross is timeless.
[time=1513] The context of 2 Timothy, what's going on here is this, that Paul is speaking back into the life, but not just the life, the ministry of this young pastor Timothy.
[time=1524] And he's encouraging him with these words to help him understand that there is nothing more relevant, nothing more practical than the gospel.
[time=1533] And not only does it have present use, but it has future use forever.
[time=1538] Understand this idea that new fads come and go, don't they?
[time=1542] Even within Christian circles, new Christian living books are published every month, probably every day, right?
[time=1551] New ministry ideas sweep across the globe, promising fuller churches, promising more engaged churchgoers.
[time=1562] Discussions on how to be more relevant happen in church staff meetings probably every week, but the gospel, the gospel never changes.
[time=1575] And the gospel remains the most relevant truth for every single human.
[time=1580] The gospel remains the most practical help for the hurting masses around the globe.
[time=1587] An author named Roy Hessian in his little book called "We Would See Jesus" said this about Christian ministry.
[time=1592] He said this, "We direly need to leave our lusting forever larger spheres of Christian service and concentrate on seeing God for ourselves
[time=1602] and finding the deep answers to life in him and his gospel." Then he says, "Even if we are located in the most obscure corner of the globe,
[time=1612] the world will make a road to our door to get that answer." Similar to what Peter said to John in John chapter 6 when Jesus says some really difficult words about eating his body and drinking his blood,
[time=1625] and some of the disciples leave because they say this, and that's just too hard of a statement, I can't handle it.
[time=1631] And so Jesus looks to the 12 and he says, "Are you going to leave as well?" Peter answers with just beautiful words.
[time=1638] He says, "Where else can we go for only you have words of eternal life?"
[time=1646] You see, the cross is timeless, but not only is it timeless, it's historical.
[time=1652] The word gospel is where we get that from.
[time=1655] When we see in Second Timothy 2, 8, it says, "As preached in my gospel," gospel is a word that means good news.
[time=1661] It is good news.
[time=1663] The gospel is an event which has already taken place in human history.
[time=1669] In fact, go back to chapter 1.
[time=1672] We could even argue that it took place before human history even began.
[time=1677] Look at what it says in verse 9.
[time=1679] By the power of God who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works, but because of his own purpose and grace,
[time=1687] which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began.
[time=1693] You see, this idea of the saving work of Christ was in place before the world ever began.
[time=1700] So it's an event that's already taken place, and so Paul says to Timothy, this young pastor, remember Jesus,
[time=1710] risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel.
[time=1714] These statements are literally rooting the person in the work of Christ deep down into the soil of centuries past.
[time=1723] It's foundational to Christian ministry and to Christian living.
[time=1727] You see, the gospel means good news.
[time=1731] It's not simply just good advice.
[time=1735] Tim Keller quotes Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones, and Dr. Jones says this.
[time=1740] He says there's a big difference between advice and news.
[time=1744] This is really good.
[time=1745] Advice is counsel about something to do.
[time=1749] It hasn't happened, but you can do it.
[time=1752] News is a report about something that has happened.
[time=1757] You can't do anything about it.
[time=1759] It's been done for you, and all you can do is respond to it.
[time=1764] Dr. Jones uses an example.
[time=1766] He says this.
[time=1767] If a king goes into battle against an invading army to defend his land, if the king defeats the invading army, he sends back to the capital city, messengers, heralds,
[time=1778] and what they come back with is a report.
[time=1781] The invaders have been defeated.
[time=1783] It's all done.
[time=1785] Therefore, respond with joy and conduct your lives in the peace that's been won for you.
[time=1792] However, if the king doesn't defeat the invaders, he sends back military advisors.
[time=1803] And those advisors say marksmen over here, horsemen over there, archers over there.
[time=1808] We need to fight for our lives.
[time=1811] You see, Dr. Lloyd-Jones says every other religion sends military advisors.
[time=1817] Every other religion says if you want your salvation, you would better fight for your life.
[time=1823] Every other religion is sending advice, saying here are the rights and here are the rituals and here are the laws and the regulations.
[time=1832] But Christianity, we send messengers.
[time=1836] We send heralds, not military advisor, and these messengers carry a message of joy and peace
[time=1843] that Calvary has secured for us not only a present full of peace and joy and fulfillment, but also our future as well.
[time=1854] You see, the gospel is timeless and it's historical.
[time=1858] So next, let's explore this present and future which has been secured for us through the work of Christ.
[time=1864] So we've seen the historic reality of the gospel.
[time=1867] Secondly, let's examine the present and future implications.
[time=1870] Look at what it says in 2 Timothy 2, verse 8.
[time=1873] Again, he says, remember Jesus Christ, and let's look at this next phrase.
[time=1877] Risen from the dead.
[time=1881] Risen from the dead. This is a present implication that we get to enjoy.
[time=1889] Jesus is presently alive.
[time=1892] He is risen from the dead. He's no longer in the grave.
[time=1895] And listen to this.
[time=1896] If he is alive, then he's present with us, right?
[time=1901] If he is alive, then we will be with him one day.
[time=1909] If he was risen from the dead, so we in turn, if we have our faith and trust in him, we will rise from the dead.
[time=1916] Romans 6 says it this way.
[time=1918] Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
[time=1924] We were buried, therefore, with him by baptism into death in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,
[time=1931] we too might walk in newness of life.
[time=1934] If we've been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.
[time=1942] You see, the implications of what he's done?
[time=1944] What Paul is telling him is this, that he is alive. He's risen from the dead.
[time=1951] But secondly, it says this. He's the offspring of David.
[time=1955] The implication of that is this, that Jesus Christ from the very line of David is now still on the throne ruling and reigning.
[time=1966] If he is of the line of David, then he's on the throne.
[time=1969] If he is of the line of David, then everything is in subjection to him.
[time=1974] If he is of the line of David, then he alone.
[time=1979] He alone has the power to judge. Beautiful scene in Revelation chapter four and chapter five.
[time=1986] Revelation four is this depiction of this beautiful scene in heaven.
[time=1991] Of God on his throne and lightning and peels of thunder and almost somewhat of a scary, scary scene of just the majesty and the glory of God.
[time=2001] And in chapter five, John tells us as he's had this vision of heaven and he gets to partake of what's going on in there,
[time=2009] he's weeping because there's this scroll and there's seals on the scroll and it can't be opened because no one's worthy to open the scroll.
[time=2017] And that scroll represents the consummation of God's judgment against the world.
[time=2024] And so the idea is that if the scroll can't be opened, then the judgment won't take place.
[time=2030] Listen what it says in Revelation five, verse one.
[time=2034] This is John speaking.
[time=2035] I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on back sealed with seven seals
[time=2042] and I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice.
[time=2045] Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?
[time=2049] John says no one, no one in heaven on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or even to look into it.
[time=2055] And I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
[time=2063] One of the elders said to me, weep no more.
[time=2067] For behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David has conquered Calvary so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.
[time=2082] You see, there are present implications to this amazing event that happened some 2000 years ago that we benefit from today.
[time=2089] He's alive, he's on the throne. Look at the context of 2 Timothy as we look at a few more of these implications.
[time=2097] Look at chapter one verse ten.
[time=2099] He's talking there about this beautiful description of the gospel and then he says this.
[time=2104] This has now been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus and listen to what he did.
[time=2110] He abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
[time=2117] It's a present implication of Calvary that there is now death to death.
[time=2123] It does not reign over us and it gives us life and a future of immortality with him in heaven.
[time=2131] We could back up to even just wider context of these amazing implications of the truth of Calvary.
[time=2139] If he did what he said he would do, then there is no longer any condemnation for us, Romans 8-1.
[time=2147] If he did what he said he came to do, then I am at peace with God, Romans 5-1.
[time=2153] If he, then I am, then he is working all things out for my good, Romans 8-28.
[time=2159] If he, then I am cleansed, Hebrews 10-22.
[time=2162] If he is who he said he is and did what he did, then I am no longer a slave to sin, Romans 6.
[time=2168] If he, then I am a son of the most high, Galatians 4-5.
[time=2172] If he, then I am holy and blameless and above reproach, Colossians 1-22.
[time=2179] But not only that, not only does it impact me, but it impacts how I treat others as well.
[time=2184] These present implications of the work of Calvary.
[time=2187] If he was humble enough to leave heaven and come to earth,
[time=2193] then I can follow in his example and pursue humility as well, Philippians chapter 2.
[time=2199] If he was gracious enough to look upon his enemy and grant forgiveness to me,
[time=2207] then I can surely grant forgiveness to others, Ephesians 4-32.
[time=2212] If he was willing to give up the riches of heaven and become poor for my sake,
[time=2219] then I can follow in his example and in the power he gives me so that I can now give, having been made rich in him.
[time=2229] 2 Corinthians 8-9.
[time=2232] I can now draw near to God because of what he has done, Hebrews 10-21.
[time=2238] Whereas before, I could not enter the presence of God.
[time=2243] If he can endure suffering, then I surely can endure some of the suffering
[time=2250] that this world brings, Hebrews 12, chapter 3.
[time=2253] See, why do we need to remember Jesus first of all because we need to live on a daily basis,
[time=2259] realizing, rejoicing, and living in the good of these implications which have been secured for us through the gospel?
[time=2268] Secondly, why do we need to remember Jesus because of the present tendency of our human reality?
[time=2277] C.J. Mahaney, a pastor, has four temptations and tendencies that we can experience sometimes.
[time=2285] I think they're good. The list certainly isn't exhaustive, but I think it's helpful.
[time=2289] The first one is this, this human tendency that we have that I have to forget.
[time=2293] We're just forgetful people, aren't we?
[time=2296] We have a daily tendency to forget the gospel, how soon we forget.
[time=2301] There's times when I forget my own phone number.
[time=2306] Somebody's, "Hey, what's your number?" and I say, "Oh, just give me a second, right?
[time=2311] Give me a second." And you're hoping that your mind just can work well enough to recall that.
[time=2317] But man, I can go several seconds, and it's just like, it's just not there.
[time=2323] I could meet somebody new out in the hallway and I could do my best to look them in the eye to shake their hand and use all the tricks that the book say to repeat their name three times
[time=2334] in normal conversation, right? And then the next day, 30 minutes later maybe.
[time=2339] You know what, could you please remind me of your name?
[time=2342] We're just, we're forgetful people.
[time=2345] This is why Paul says to Timothy, "Remember Jesus."
[time=2351] We're forgetful.
[time=2353] Secondly, we battle legalism on a daily basis.
[time=2356] Legalism is seeking to achieve forgiveness from God or justification before God and acceptance by God through our own obedience to God.
[time=2365] Legalism is about achieving, grace is about receiving.
[time=2368] Legalism is about promoting ourselves, grace is about promoting Christ.
[time=2373] It's our attempt to add to or substitute our works for His finished work.
[time=2381] You see, we're at our core, just self-preserving people.
[time=2388] I think I'm self-sufficient.
[time=2390] I think that I can self- atone for my wrongdoing so that ultimately I'll get the self-glorification.
[time=2397] You see, we live and we can slide into a world of performance in relating to God.
[time=2402] Instead of living in the good of the implications secured for us through the Gospel.
[time=2407] This is why Paul says in 2.28, "Remember Jesus." Third, subjectivism.
[time=2413] There's a daily tendency to be subjective, not objective.
[time=2419] It's how the vast majority of us approach life on a daily basis.
[time=2422] It's subjective, not objective.
[time=2424] We're more concerned about what's going on inside of us and how we feel rather than what's happening outside of us
[time=2430] and what is a reality.
[time=2432] The effects of this are obvious.
[time=2434] When we are feelings-oriented or when we let our feelings dictate how we respond to circumstances,
[time=2440] our days are like an internal roller coaster.
[time=2445] And you know, that may be okay for a 55-second ride.
[time=2448] But I certainly don't want to live my life like that.
[time=2454] For too many of us, it's how we live our lives.
[time=2457] Life is a spiritual, relational, emotional roller coaster.
[time=2463] But you see, the Gospel, the Gospel is objective.
[time=2468] It's outside of us.
[time=2470] It happened apart from us.
[time=2472] The fact that Christ was suspended between heaven and hell on a cross to take the full wrath of God's anger will never change.
[time=2481] Your emotional state at any given moment is irrelevant to this event.
[time=2486] Martin Luther said this.
[time=2489] He says, "Most of our unhappiness in life comes from listening to yourself instead of talking to yourself."
[time=2498] We're so concerned about how we feel, feel how I feel.
[time=2504] We repeat the phrase, "I feel this, I feel this, I feel that all throughout the day." Again, our feelings are real.
[time=2510] But how about if we say God's Word says, God's Word says, God's Word says.
[time=2515] And we come back to the objective reality of who God is and what He's accomplished for us.
[time=2522] Again, Martin Luther, most of our unhappiness in life comes from listening to yourself instead of talking to yourself.
[time=2528] I would say instead of talking to yourself about living in the good of the implications secured through the Gospel.
[time=2534] This is why Paul says to Timothy, "Remember Jesus, fourth, the fourth tendency, condemnation."
[time=2544] Conviction is a wonderful gift from God that He puts upon our heart, but condemnation is a tool of Satan.
[time=2551] And condemnation, for most of us, it's a common experience.
[time=2555] And for too many of us, condemnation is a constant companion.
[time=2560] We go about our day feeling like there's just 300 pounds of luggage that we're carrying around.
[time=2565] And we live more aware of that 300 pounds of luggage than we do of the saving work of Christ.
[time=2572] Too many, too many of us are more familiar with condemnation than with justification.
[time=2580] And when we're more familiar with condemnation, we just keep a respectful distance from God.
[time=2585] When we're too familiar with condemnation, we feel like God is disappointed with us rather than delighting over us in Jesus.
[time=2592] When we're too familiar with condemnation, we view God as simply tolerating us.
[time=2598] We feel like we're on probation even though we've confessed sin.
[time=2602] When we're too familiar with condemnation, we live with low-grade unresolved guilt.
[time=2607] We rarely experience joy.
[time=2611] See, Satan is a master of bringing condemnation directly on the heels of our sinful choices and actions
[time=2619] because he finds footholds when we live outside of the good of the implications secured for us at Calvary.
[time=2628] And this is why Paul says to Timothy, "Remember Jesus."
[time=2635] So we need to remember. We need to remember because we need to exist on a daily basis realizing,
[time=2645] rejoicing, and living in the good of the realities of Calvary secured by Christ.
[time=2652] And we need to remember because the human tendency is to not realize and to not live in the good of the implication
[time=2661] because of things like forgetfulness, legalism, subjectivism, condemnation.
[time=2672] So let's take a look now that we understand the need to remember Jesus.
[time=2677] How do we do it? How do we preach the gospel to ourselves on a daily basis?
[time=2682] So what are some practical ways? And I certainly don't have an exhaustive list and I'm certainly not an expert, but I hope I'm growing in my ability to preach the gospel to myself.
[time=2693] But here are three hopefully practical steps for us to take on a daily basis that would help each of us remember Jesus a little bit more often in our days.
[time=2705] The first is this. We remember Jesus by rejecting the good person illusion.
[time=2713] You say, "Josh, what are you talking about?" Let me explain. Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones has another example that I think is really clarifying.
[time=2722] He says, "Suppose someone came to your house and you weren't there, but while they were there, they paid a debt for you.
[time=2729] And they came to you and they said, "Hey, I was at your house and while I was there, somebody came and I paid a debt for you."
[time=2739] Dr. Jones says, "It's very important for me to understand how I should respond. It's important for me to understand a little bit more about that debt."
[time=2747] And he says this, "If it was just simply some postage due, that's really not a big deal. I can just say, "Oh, you know what, thank you very much for doing that.
[time=2756] I really appreciate you. You didn't have to, but hey, thanks a lot." And it's over.
[time=2760] But if on the other hand, it's that package from the IRS that has not only the taxes that have been due for years, but penalties and back taxes and all those things that equal up to a couple hundred thousand dollars.
[time=2775] Now, if I understand that size of debt, I know I need to be a little bit more thankful at that point, right?
[time=2779] At that point, I'm down on my knees. Are you kidding me? You paid that debt for me? You did that for me?
[time=2788] There's a completely different response depending on the size of the debt, correct?
[time=2794] Most of us, if not all of us, function in our daily lives feeling like we're not so bad. Feeling like our debt isn't that great.
[time=2809] I mean, I know a lot of you. We can be really nice. We can be really kind people. We can be very helpful to others.
[time=2821] I mean, I think I'm the type of person. I would guess if I sat and talked with most of you that I would come to the understanding that you're the type of person who would help someone across the street if they needed it.
[time=2832] You're the type of person who would coach their kids sports team. You're the type of person who might even win the nicest guy at work award.
[time=2841] You're the type of person that every Sunday you're in church, and most Sundays you're putting money in the plate.
[time=2850] You see, the problem comes, though, when we allow these good attributes to define us and get this and then to trick us into thinking that we don't need 100% of Jesus 100% of the time.
[time=2868] You see, underneath all the nice and kind things that we do sits a ticking, beating, self-preserving, self-serving, wicked heart that needs Jesus completely.
[time=2881] My heart is deceptive. Jeremiah 17 9 says this, "The heart is deceptively wicked." Who can understand it?
[time=2894] Larnell Harris, some of you may recognize that name, some of you may not, but I've been singing this song for the past week or so, and you can ask my family, they're probably getting sick of it, but it just resonated so well.
[time=2905] But he has this song, "Were It Not For Grace?" And it's this idea that apart from Christ, we have no hope.
[time=2914] But he says this in the chorus, "Were It Not For Grace? I can tell you where I'd be, wandering down some pointless road to nowhere with my salvation up to me.
[time=2926] I know how that would go, the battles I would face, forever running but losing this race, were it not for grace."
[time=2936] See, we need to reject the good person illusion. So what I'd recommend is just every morning, no matter what your morning ritual is, maybe add something to it.
[time=2948] I don't know if you hit the snooze several times, I don't know if you put the alarm clock across the room or whatever it is that you do in the morning, what if you did something like this?
[time=2956] What if every morning you rehearse when you get out of bed, when you can say this to yourself, "I am, I am at my core, a self-preserving, self-serving person who needs Jesus 100% every minute."
[time=2972] Every second of these 24 hours. What if you just started there? Just rehearse the reality at my core, at my core, apart from Christ, I'm going to pursue my own things today.
[time=2989] I'm going to try to preserve that which I think is good for me. I'm going to serve myself today and I need Jesus 100%, 100%.
[time=3004] We remember Jesus by rejecting the good person illusion. Secondly, we remember Jesus by running to Him.
[time=3011] You see, if you start every day like that, you're going to go throughout your day, hopefully with an understanding of just your great need that you have for Jesus.
[time=3022] Because what happens is when we understand that great need, we're going to be tempted to run to other sources to fill that need.
[time=3031] We're going to run to things that we think will somehow comfort us, whether that's food or leisure or pleasure, or we're going to run to some sort of performance that says, "Hey, I'm going to somehow do better today."
[time=3043] But all of those things are empty. We need to run to Jesus to find our comfort. We need to run to Jesus to find our care because He is our only true hero.
[time=3055] No one has ever done more for you than Jesus has. No one loves you more or better than Jesus, not even yourself.
[time=3065] You can't love yourself better than Jesus loves you. Jesus is our only true hero.
[time=3073] And so when we understand the beginning of the day that we need Him, then throughout that day we can rest in His love. We can rejoice in His care.
[time=3081] And then we can reframe our circumstances, no matter what happens to us that day, reframe those circumstances to live in the good of what He's accomplished.
[time=3090] One of the phrases that goes around in the ring household that my wife Paula has helped me with is this, just understanding that every day it's my best day.
[time=3098] Every day I wake up, it's my best day. Why? Because my biggest problem has been solved.
[time=3106] Because of Jesus, I'm no longer at a distance from God. I'm no longer His enemy, but He has adopted me.
[time=3112] He has taken the sinful choices that I have made and the wrath that I deserve and died for me and given me His perfect righteousness so that now I'm a delight of the Father.
[time=3123] My biggest problem is solved in all others pale in comparison. They're real, all these other problems, right? And sometimes they're really awful.
[time=3136] But they pale in comparison to what Christ has done. And so no matter what happens, we can reframe as we run to Him and rest in His care and rejoice in His goodness.
[time=3148] We can reframe our circumstances to say this is my best day, no matter what happens.
[time=3156] So we reject the good person illusion. Hopefully that's helpful.
[time=3161] We remember by running to Jesus. And then third, we remember by rehearsing the realities.
[time=3171] All these implications that we've talked about. All the beautiful, declarative truths about who God is and what He's done in Scripture.
[time=3178] All of those truths about Him we rehearse.
[time=3183] We become an expert in understanding the implications of Calvary and we do that several ways.
[time=3190] First way is by practicing it in our circumstances on a daily basis, right?
[time=3194] If you want to become good at anything, what do you have to do? You have to practice every day, right?
[time=3201] And so we have to practice rehearsing these realities in our daily circumstances.
[time=3207] Let me give you an example. I work for a company and most of my pay comes from commission.
[time=3213] And the reality is whether it's commission or not, all of us sometimes can have anxiety over finances, right?
[time=3220] And for me, it's not necessarily, you know, month to month, but it's, oh, my goodness, is my savings account going to increase or is it going to decrease this month?
[time=3227] You know, based upon not having too many commissions, I can see my savings account, you know, start to dwindle.
[time=3232] And then I start to get anxious, right? And then I come back to Philippians 4-6.
[time=3236] This says, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything with prayer and petition, present your request to God."
[time=3242] But we forget Philippians 4-5. It's the context, right?
[time=3247] Most everybody knows Philippians 4-6, but we don't understand Philippians 4-5.
[time=3252] We've not understood the context there, but at the end of verse 5, it says this, "The Lord is at hand."
[time=3260] Therefore, do not be anxious about anything.
[time=3265] You see, if I understand what Paul is telling Timothy to remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, if he is alive, then he's present with me.
[time=3275] If he is alive, then the Lord is at hand, and I don't have to be anxious, and so there are days when I repeat, "The Lord is at hand in my car."
[time=3282] When I'm driving to my next appointment and I'm thinking, "Are they going to accept my recommendations? Are they going to move forward, or are they not?"
[time=3289] I can simply say, "The Lord is at hand." And whether they move forward or not, the beauty of the gospel, how it impacts my current situation.
[time=3298] And I can rejoice in those implications that whether they move forward or not, that he is at hand, and he has very great and precious promises that I can rest in.
[time=3309] We practice it, practice it in our circumstances, but not only do we practice it, we memorize Scripture.
[time=3317] Oh, I'd encourage you to put to memory some wonderful passages that talk about the gospel. Ephesians 2, 1 through 10 is a wonderful passage, Titus 3.
[time=3328] Revelation 5 that I read to you this morning, memorize Scripture, listen to music that's gospel-centered, read books about the gospel.
[time=3344] You understand that the Bible talks about this, but you can never come to the end of exploring Jesus.
[time=3351] The gospel is a mystery, and you can never come to the end of it. It's like if we went down to Indianapolis and we wanted to just explore Lucas Oil Stadium.
[time=3360] And we kind of had a little tour of it, and we got to go out on the field, and then we looked in the locker rooms, and we're like, "We want to see more, we want to see more."
[time=3368] So we explore every nook and cranny of that place, and we think, "Okay, we've seen it." And then somebody says, "Oh, wait, there's a door. Where does that lead to you?"
[time=3376] And so we go over there, and we open that door, and we walk into it. Now it's another Lucas Oil Stadium that we just walked into.
[time=3383] It was so much more to explore. I mean, that's the gospel. Can never come to the bottom of it. The depth of the wonder and of the awe and of the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=3400] You can never come to the bottom of it, and into eternity we'll be singing the praises of the Lamb forever and ever and ever.
[time=3408] So books are helpful. I could encourage you to run after this and get the gospel primer by Milton Vincent.
[time=3417] It's a wonderful tool that will just push you into the work of Christ.
[time=3423] Books Like the Cross-Centered Life by C. J. Mahaney, a new one that I love because he loves me by Elise Fitzpatrick.
[time=3431] It will help you understand the implications of what God accomplished in Christ on a daily basis. It'll help you understand how to live in such a way that you're living in the good of the gospel.
[time=3444] We could even go back in time, John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. It's one of the super texts in the world.
[time=3452] But it will help you dive deeper into the person and work of Christ.
[time=3458] So how do we become, how do we rehearse these realities?
[time=3462] We become an expert by practicing it in our circumstances, by memorizing Scripture, by listening to music, by reading books, and then just quickly learn to identify the tendencies that might be prone for you.
[time=3476] Whether that's forgetfulness, or whether that's condemnation, or whether that's legalism, or subjectivism.
[time=3482] Try to identify it and have your spouse help you identify it in you.
[time=3486] When you're saying things like, "I'm just feeling this way," or "I'm feeling that way," and your spouse can say, "You know, instead of thinking about internal things, why don't you focus on the person and work of Christ?"
[time=3497] And so your spouse can help you combat that. Legalism. When you find yourself just starting to somehow get in this performance trap, and somehow you're thinking in this day that, "I've got to be better today."
[time=3510] Stop. Stop yourself. And just say, "I don't have to be better today," because Jesus was better.
[time=3518] And because He was better, His righteousness gets accounted to me, and now I can live in the good. I can rest in His work. I can rejoice in His care for me.
[time=3530] So learn to identify your tendencies to depart from the gospel.
