[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] Well hello again and welcome to the broadcast, it's great to have you with us and I'm so thankful that my friend Lonnie Heck has joined us today.
[time=41] Lonnie's a part of the Blackhawk family and part of our ministry team here at Blackhawk. Lonnie gives oversight and leadership and involvement to a very special I think very important ministry here at Blackhawk. It's called Celebrate Recovery.
[time=56] Hi buddy, good to see you. I'm doing well, how are you? I'm doing great man, glad you're here. Some of you may know about Celebrate Recovery, some of you may not.
[time=64] I am so grateful that we have a ministry here at Blackhawk and this same ministry Celebrate Recovery is at the Chapel and at Fellowship Missionary and Pathway Church.
[time=77] Yeah, Pathway community, the bridge. It's in a number of places around the city and I'm really thankful because what it does is it offers people who are struggling with sin, hurts and habits and hang ups.
[time=95] The result of things that have transpired in one's past, the struggle with the addictive nature of sin and it's a tremendous ministry that helps give people not only hope but practical every day, week after week involvement to help them navigate those waters.
[time=116] I describe it in my way Lonnie, why don't you just from your own perspective as somebody who's been in CR and now leads CR, if somebody says what's CR about, what would be your brief pitch?
[time=129] CR is definitely about all that, it gives people hope. I think for me, I came in there to find freedom from that sin that has just constantly been in my life and I thought that's the way it was going to be.
[time=143] And a lot of people come in to see are looking for that answer and what is it going to take for me to stop doing that thing that I've been doing for a long time, that I'm ashamed of, that has hurt me, that I used to hurt people and through CR we really talk about Christ and that's that thing that's going to help you stop doing that sin.
[time=165] That's great, that's great and I couldn't agree more and it's why I'm so thankful for CR, there are a lot of recovery programs out there and I'm not being critical of any of them, I'm just really thankful for Celebrate Recovery
[time=180] because at the very core of Celebrate Recovery the message is that we need the person and the power and the freedom that's only found in relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=193] And so for that I'm grateful, you guys meet here at Blackhawk, the Celebrate Recovery community meets when and at what time?
[time=202] We meet Wednesday nights, every Wednesday night, seven to nine in the high school library, come in door eight, there'll be signs, there'll be people there to direct you where we're at.
[time=211] We rotate each week with somebody either talking about how CR and Christ has changed their life or we give a lesson on how we can use others in the word to change those things we want to change about ourselves.
[time=224] Fantastic, Wednesday night, seven o'clock, come in door eight here at the Blackhawk campus, seven to nine and I can't thank you enough for what you and your team are doing and I want to invite you, Lonnie and I both want to just say to you before we go today
[time=239] that we both understand what he mentioned earlier, the shame and the discouragement of a sin that continues to kind of win the day in your life and in hours.
[time=251] We know what that feels like and we can't implore you, beg you, invite you strong enough to come and be a part of this and to let the Word of God and the Spirit of God and the people of God
[time=265] and the person of Christ bring freedom to your life from that addictive battle and that struggle with sin.
[time=272] God bless you, thank you so much for tuning in and as always we hope to see you soon.
[time=295] [MUSIC]
[time=314] Put your hands together and praise them.
[time=317] Thank you God for your grace.
[time=319] We worship you in this place today.
[time=322] Let's continue to praise him, let's continue to sing about his name.
[time=326] [MUSIC - 90 seconds]
[time=424] Jesus in your name we praise, come and fill our hearts today, and give us faith to live for you.
[time=442] [MUSIC - 56 seconds]
[time=523] You hear the cry of the broken.
[time=635] Let the nation sing louder because nothing has the power to sing with your name.
[time=648] [MUSIC]
[time=662] There's nothing has the power to sing with your name.
[time=680] We praise your Father.
[time=689] [MUSIC]
[time=717] This is the air.
[time=726] This is the air I breathe.
[time=739] Your holy presence living in me.
[time=754] This is my daily breath.
[time=766] You're the everyone.
[time=772] Spoken to me.
[time=778] And I, I'm desperate for you.
[time=791] And I, I'm lost without you.
[time=804] This is the air I breathe.
[time=819] Your holy presence living in me.
[time=831] Oh, this is my daily breath.
[time=846] You're very well, spoken to me.
[time=858] And I, I'm desperate for you.
[time=871] And I, I'm lost without you.
[time=883] And I, I'm desperate for you.
[time=897] And I, I'm lost without you.
[time=909] Sing it out, and I, I'm desperate for you.
[time=921] Oh my God, and I, I'm lost without you.
[time=935] And I'm desperate for you.
[time=950] And I, I'm lost without you.
[time=968] I'm lost, I'm lost without you.
[time=977] I'm lost without you.
[time=984] And I, I'm desperate for you.
[time=999] And I, I'm lost without you.
[time=1021] I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just,
[time=1444] is elevating his reputation, it's furthering his name.
[time=1449] It's making God famous.
[time=1450] The primary purpose in life follow along.
[time=1454] The primary purpose in life for the believer is to live out the principles of their faith, to live in obedience to the gospel's transforming power and to reflect the heart and character of God, and their everyday choices and decisions for when this happens or mostly happens, we with great purpose reflect well on the one we follow.
[time=1477] He is glorified.
[time=1481] His name is lifted up.
[time=1483] His reputation is heightened.
[time=1486] That phrase right there toward the end, it's so important in this discussion about bringing glory to God.
[time=1492] It's what you reflect.
[time=1493] You're always reflecting something.
[time=1496] In the everyday of your life, Monday and Friday, morning, noon and night with them or alone, we're always a reflection of something.
[time=1505] And here we're called to live with this great purpose way beyond us, this effort to make God famous, to make God look good.
[time=1515] So how can you, how can we do this?
[time=1518] How can we be a people who live with the great purpose of bringing glory to God?
[time=1526] Not making life what you want it to be for you, but instead making life about a reflection of a God you love and serve and are grateful for.
[time=1538] All my friends, this is a huge question.
[time=1543] And this is something that needs to make sense to you 13 year olds.
[time=1549] It needs to make sense to our kids and it needs to make sense to those of us who have walked this road a while.
[time=1558] We need to make sure that we have our arms around practically what this looks like to bring glory to God.
[time=1565] Let me give you a few things.
[time=1566] Few practical ways, I hope this helps.
[time=1568] I hope this will move you further down this road.
[time=1571] I really do believe it is the greatest purpose you could ever engage with.
[time=1575] Here's number one, you make God look great when you sing greatly.
[time=1582] Now don't like a half the room just started to check out.
[time=1585] Don't check out on me, stay with me here on this one.
[time=1588] I really want you to know all of this is right here in the word of God and there's something about this one that I think really is appropriate for all of us to at least consider for just a moment this morning.
[time=1599] I wanna say that to you again, you make God according to the scriptures, you make God look great when you sing greatly.
[time=1610] Like a first chronicle, 16.
[time=1611] First chronicle, 16, verses 23, 24, first part of 25, it says, you see it there on the screen, it says in first chronicles, 16, 23, sing to the Lord, all the earth, that's you, that's me.
[time=1627] Sing to the Lord, all the earth proclaim good tidings of His salvation from day to day.
[time=1635] So there is a sense where this is to be a regular and ongoing daily experience.
[time=1641] Us singing about the good tidings, the good things about this great salvation that He has offered.
[time=1649] Tell of His glory among the nations, His wonderful, as you sing, you're telling of His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all the peoples.
[time=1660] And then it says in 25, for great is the Lord, and here it is, and greatly to be praised.
[time=1668] You and I are to sing greatly.
[time=1676] I want you to see that, I want you to underline that.
[time=1679] The Bible says repeatedly that our singing, our biblical song, our voices with the music, as we've already done this morning, can bring, it has the capacity and it was designed by God to bring great glory to God.
[time=1694] As the people of God sing greatly, it should be a great purpose in your life.
[time=1700] That's right, singing, singing, singing in the shower.
[time=1706] Yeah, okay, alone in the car, that's good.
[time=1709] I'm with you, but the Bible clearly prioritizes.
[time=1714] You making a joyful noise in the assembly in the gathering of God's people.
[time=1720] It does, I wouldn't tell you if it wasn't true.
[time=1724] And it doesn't make any exceptions.
[time=1728] It simply tells you the people of God, all throughout the scripture.
[time=1735] Let your song be heard in the assembly.
[time=1738] Let your praise be lifted up in the assembly.
[time=1740] Let your song ascend to the heavens and in so doing, allow God, the praise and glory, do His name.
[time=1750] So I want to just encourage you this morning.
[time=1753] Or maybe I want to challenge you, maybe I just want you to think with me.
[time=1756] So why, so why don't you?
[time=1758] Why don't you sing greatly?
[time=1767] It doesn't say sing softly.
[time=1770] It doesn't say sing inconsistently.
[time=1775] It doesn't say sing half heartedly.
[time=1780] It says that we are to as an act of worship before a God that we love who designed this in a way to receive glory and honor and praise through our song, our voices, good, bad and otherwise.
[time=1795] It says we're to come into a place like this and do that.
[time=1798] And yet you know, and I know that there are times when we don't.
[time=1806] And if it's this big of a deal and it is, then it's a really big deal if you're not.
[time=1816] And I want you to be able to, I want you to be able to walk into a place like this and I want us to be able to as a family live in worshipful obedience to God and He says, sing greatly.
[time=1830] Couple things, number one.
[time=1836] Part of this would be on those leading because the family of God gathered can't sing greatly if they, for instance, if they don't know a song.
[time=1846] So we have to make sure that as a family, we're teaching you and engaging you in the songs that we're gonna sing.
[time=1856] And we've got great leaders who think that through and offer that and we're gonna keep working at doing that because you can't sing if you don't know the song.
[time=1865] So we're gonna keep teaching you the songs.
[time=1867] See, then there are, that's one reason.
[time=1871] One thing we got to keep in mind, you got to know the song to sing greatly.
[time=1875] Another thing that sometimes keeps us from singing greatly is we don't like the song.
[time=1879] And see, that just doesn't fly.
[time=1885] It just doesn't, it's just nowhere in here.
[time=1893] Nowhere.
[time=1894] And the moment I say, the moment I say, I don't like the moment those words come out of my mouth.
[time=1904] I don't like that, the instant those words come out, I just made it about who, me.
[time=1911] And this isn't about me.
[time=1915] And it's not about you.
[time=1918] It is supposed to be about him.
[time=1921] And the words on the screen and the music that plays are simply a mechanism and a mechanism only to allow you the chance to obediently worship God with great singing that brings great glory to him.
[time=1934] And we've got to make sure that we're doing that in a humble and gracious way, all of us together, one song, one voice.
[time=1944] And I think we've done a huge disservice over the years.
[time=1949] And culture hasn't helped because we've all grown up in this, especially as it relates to music.
[time=1956] We've grown up in this kind of this consumeristic, I like or I don't like culture.
[time=1961] Somehow music just kind of has taken up this place in us
[time=1967] where we have such strong opinions about it.
[time=1971] And I understand, I do too.
[time=1973] I'm not saying you shouldn't have strong opinions.
[time=1977] I have huge opinions about music, but this right here is not the setting within which those are to be exercised.
[time=1985] This is a setting within which God calls you and me, whatever you might think or I might think, to sing greatly for his sake and for his glory because he's asked you to, amen?
[time=2000] And so that's what I invite us to.
[time=2003] God looks great when we sing greatly.
[time=2007] You wanna live with purpose?
[time=2009] You wanna live for the glory of God?
[time=2010] Write this one down.
[time=2011] Number two, you make God look great when you take him to the nations.
[time=2016] You make God look great when you take him and his truth and his love and his character and his heart.
[time=2021] When you and I take God to the nations, the Bible says, we make God look great.
[time=2028] In other words, when you go, we've been inviting you to go and now we're seeing more and more and more of us going.
[time=2034] It's exactly what God's word had in mind.
[time=2037] And God's name and his reputation gets elevated when the people of God go to the nations when you proclaim his truth to others.
[time=2045] When the world hears your story of a changed and transformed life, when the nations see the goodness of God lived out in the generosity of his people.
[time=2056] When you go to those far from God, when you go to those who are far from God to offer them the mercy and love of God, God's lifted up, God's reputation is heightened.
[time=2071] God receives glory.
[time=2074] Look at Psalm 96.
[time=2076] Psalm 96, I'll start you at verse two, second part of verse two, proclaim, it says, the word of God says to you and I this morning, proclaim good tidings of his salvation from day to day.
[time=2089] It goes on in verse three to say, tell of his story among the nations, his wonderful deeds among the peoples.
[time=2099] And then it says in verse four, for great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.
[time=2105] It goes on in verse 10 to say this, and I love it in verse 10.
[time=2107] It says, say among the nation, the Lord reigns.
[time=2111] What does that mean, the Lord reigns?
[time=2113] The Lord's in control, the Lord's loving, the Lord's powerful, the Lord is big, his arm is not too short.
[time=2120] Say to the nations, say to the peoples, good tidings, great truths about the Lord.
[time=2127] When we take him to the nations, the scriptures teach, he's glorified.
[time=2132] Hey, let's just make sure we're clear on this.
[time=2134] The nations, when you hear me say nations, sometimes when I hear nations, I immediately think about us going to Kenya.
[time=2141] I immediately think about us going to Uganda.
[time=2145] I think about us going to India.
[time=2147] When I think nations, I think different people over in ocean with different language.
[time=2152] And I want you to know that's okay.
[time=2155] That does come under the umbrella of nations, but please understand the gal in the cubicle next to you tomorrow who doesn't know the Lord.
[time=2166] She's the nations.
[time=2167] The nations are anybody, anywhere.
[time=2174] Any individual that hasn't received and been transformed by the grace and mercy and love of God, this is the nations.
[time=2182] And so we get this great opportunity to go to all, very simply put, you live with great purpose.
[time=2189] When God is glorified through your life and your witness toward those who don't know God.
[time=2196] If I were to ask you this morning, many of you in the room are somewhat familiar with this amazing book and the great truth that's in it and the great stories of redemption that it contains.
[time=2208] If I said to this room, hey, think of somebody whose story we see in here who did that.
[time=2216] Somebody or somebody's who, in the way that they lived out their life, in the choices that they made, they were willing to go.
[time=2225] They went somewhere else other than where they were.
[time=2228] And when they went somewhere else, they made a huge difference.
[time=2232] They took the Lord with them.
[time=2234] They took His mercy, took His truth, took His character, and they went to the nations and God did an amazing thing.
[time=2241] Who comes to your mind?
[time=2244] If you're gonna say it, say it loud so I can hear you.
[time=2247] Paul, Joseph, fantastic examples.
[time=2251] Who else?
[time=2252] Say it again.
[time=2254] Abraham, very good Ruth.
[time=2259] Oh, you guys, absolutely, here's one for you.
[time=2262] Daniel is one, but Daniel had three buddies in Daniel chapter three, their names were, say it with me, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, three guys that hated their parents.
[time=2275] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, 13, 14-year-old Hebrew boys
[time=2282] who get kidnapped, they get taken away from their home
[time=2288] and away from their family and away from all that they do, they get transported 1500 miles away to a faraway place called Babylon.
[time=2297] Overseen, run by an absolutely crazy, out of control, maniacal king named Nebuchadnezzar who hated God.
[time=2306] He hated God and not only did he hate God, and any time I think about Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, I might just break out into veggie tail lingo.
[time=2315] So, pardon me if I do, it's just the years and years and years of that beautiful VHS tape.
[time=2322] So he hated God and really at the root of it all, he wanted to be, what, God?
[time=2331] And so he takes these boys and a lot of others who were with them and he builds the statue 90 feet tall and he puts it out in the plains and he raises this golden image of himself and he declares to them, bow down to me and worship me when the music starts.
[time=2348] And I love how it reads, you should read it.
[time=2350] Read it today when you get home.
[time=2351] Daniel three, just these boys in the face of like
[time=2357] Saddam Hussein-ish type guy just said,
[time=2364] no, no way, are you kidding?
[time=2370] And really when you read the text, it's almost like they said, are you kidding me?
[time=2374] We would never do that.
[time=2377] Here we are among the nations.
[time=2380] And here we are living out our faith.
[time=2382] Here we are in a far away place holding on to what we believe and know to be true and right and good and we would, oh king, they say, in Daniel three, oh king.
[time=2393] Let it be known that we would never bow down to your idol.
[time=2396] Our God will deliver us one way or the other.
[time=2399] Where are they gonna die in the furnace?
[time=2401] We heard you, you know, he did it seven times.
[time=2404] We got you, we're not gonna do it.
[time=2406] So I just want you to remember stories like this,
[time=2412] true stories of real people who went to the nations.
[time=2416] Sometimes they went willingly and sometimes they got kidnapped.
[time=2421] But God delivers them from the furnace 'cause he did throw them in.
[time=2425] There wasn't a hair on their body that was singed.
[time=2428] There's an angel in there with them.
[time=2430] Nebuchadnezzar sees the whole thing and Nebuchadnezzar repents.
[time=2436] How's that?
[time=2439] Because there were three young boys who were willing to give glory and honor to God, not themselves, the glorified God.
[time=2451] They made his name great.
[time=2453] They furthered his reputation in a far away place, be it Babylon or the cubicle at work tomorrow.
[time=2461] Isaiah 66, would you look at that?
[time=2465] Isaiah 66, 19.
[time=2467] Just a great reminder for us this morning.
[time=2474] God says, and he's speaking of Israel here, I will set a sign among them and we'll send survivors from them to the what?
[time=2485] I'll say it to the nations.
[time=2488] Tarsus, Putt, Lud, Meskek, Tobal, and Jovan.
[time=2493] To the distant coastlands, here it is, that have neither heard my fame nor seen my glory.
[time=2503] I'm gonna send them to those people and they will declare my glory among the nations.
[time=2511] And this is what you and I get to do.
[time=2514] We get to every day of our lives in a cubicle or across the ocean.
[time=2518] We get this privileged opportunity to go where they've not heard of his fame, nor seen his glory.
[time=2528] And it's up to you to reflect his fame and his glory.
[time=2533] And oh, how I hope you and I can embrace this opportunity.
[time=2540] It really is something he's asking you and I to engage and it really is something he's asking us to do.
[time=2547] You make God look great when you sing greatly.
[time=2552] You make God look great when you take his name to the nations.
[time=2557] Thirdly, you make God look great when you pray, write this down, when you pray according to the name of who?
[time=2564] To the name of Jesus.
[time=2568] I want you to look with me at what it says in John, the Gospel of John, chapter 14.
[time=2573] The Gospel of John, chapter 14, 13.
[time=2578] I love this, it says, whatever you ask, this is Jesus himself speaking.
[time=2582] Whatever you ask in my name, the name of Jesus, whatever you ask in my name, that will I do so that the Father may be what?
[time=2591] Say it, church, glorified in the Son.
[time=2595] Jesus is all about this.
[time=2597] Jesus is our example in this.
[time=2599] Jesus says, pray and pray in my name so that when I answer it in the way that I will, the Father can be glorified because of your willingness to trust in me.
[time=2612] So here's how that works when I bring or when you bring all your prayers.
[time=2617] Think about this, all your hopeful petitions, when you bring them to God in Jesus name, which means according to his will.
[time=2627] Remember, by kingdom come thy will be done.
[time=2631] This is how we pray.
[time=2633] When you do it that way, my friends, see what happens is you connect the outcomes of the prayer.
[time=2640] You connect the answers to these prayers to God himself because we are guaranteed that as we pray in Jesus name, Jesus there mediates it goes from Jesus to whatever happens,
[time=2655] we know that God can receive the glory.
[time=2657] Think about the things that we've prayed for.
[time=2660] Think about the miracles that we've watched and seen right before our eyes.
[time=2667] Think about the healings.
[time=2669] Think about the comfort that comes.
[time=2671] Think about all the times that we've prayed for the comfort of God to come to one who is hurting.
[time=2677] Think about the transformed life that you and I know and have witnessed.
[time=2683] Think about the restored family.
[time=2685] Think about the softened heart that once was hurt.
[time=2688] Think about your prayers.
[time=2690] The job that came out of nowhere, the strength to move forward after a heartache, pain or loss.
[time=2697] You see, when we pray for all those things, proclaiming our trust in God's will, giving the outcomes to the Lord's plan, his timing, his place, then he gets the glory.
[time=2712] Then he gets the glory and I would add, whatever the answer is to the prayer.
[time=2724] See with me?
[time=2728] 'Cause we were all feeling really good about that 'til I had to stop and say this.
[time=2733] If you wanna know if this is really about him
[time=2742] or if somehow it's still about you, then answer this question or be willing to say this to yourself.
[time=2751] Pray in his name.
[time=2752] As we pray in his name, we connect all the outcomes then to God and his glory and so then whatever the outcome is, then we have to be willing to trust that that's what in this time and place he allows and then you and I get to give him glory.
[time=2776] For what?
[time=2779] Whatever he did.
[time=2781] Well, but she died.
[time=2787] Well, but I didn't get the, see?
[time=2792] It's challenging at times.
[time=2795] When what we think and what we want and what we've got worked out in our minds, when we have to let go of that and somehow trust that a loving God is thoughtfully and with great purpose orchestrating the events of our lives and he's still on the throne.
[time=2814] There hasn't been a mistake made and he really is in his infinite wisdom.
[time=2819] He is one that we can trust and he gets made to look good when you and I pray according to the name of Jesus and trust the outcomes in a faithful and consistent way.
[time=2834] As the team comes up, we're gonna worship.
