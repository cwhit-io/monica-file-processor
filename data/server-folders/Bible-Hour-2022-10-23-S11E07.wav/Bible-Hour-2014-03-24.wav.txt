[time=279] Good morning.
[time=280] I'm Dave Walters, one of the pastors out at the chapel on the southwest side of Fort Wayne.
[time=285] It's a privilege for me to be here at Black Hawk in the Bible.
[time=288] I were giving the message this morning because I was on staff here on the pastoral staff here at Black Hawk.
[time=293] My wife taught here at the school for 10 years.
[time=296] So this truly is a homecoming for me and my family.
[time=299] We are right in the middle of a Mythbusters series.
[time=302] I'm looking forward to talking about happiness and we deserve happiness and what that means and is that really true or is it a myth.
[time=310] I do appreciate Black Hawk and all the things they are to our community.
[time=314] And I love the points of connections between the chapel and Black Hawk, the collaborative spirit between these two churches and many others.
[time=321] On a couple fronts, the chapel and Black Hawk send out teams that serve in our neighborhoods and communities and ministries throughout Fort Wayne.
[time=330] There's one in particular ministry, a Hope Center, that a couple members from Black Hawk spend significant amount of time working there.
[time=337] And the chapel just in the past few weeks collected 13,000 diapers for girls and couples in crisis pregnancy.
[time=346] And so it's an amazing collaboration we can work together.
[time=349] A couple other things we do is both Black Hawk and the chapel really view that have lasting impact.
[time=356] We have to have a strong leadership culture.
[time=359] And so Black Hawk for years has hosted the Global Leadership Summit.
[time=363] And just this past year is at the Grand Wayne Center and the chapel has been fortunate enough to partner with Black Hawk in bringing that to this community.
[time=371] The third way we're collaborating and this is where it gets real exciting is globally internationally.
[time=378] Black Hawk and the chapel have been involved in one of the most heinous evil sins in our generation and that's a sex trafficking.
[time=389] And we both are involved with ministries who are trying to put an end to that in their communities.
[time=394] And I love that we both can do that.
[time=397] We are in talking right now about sending teams together to go to the same place.
[time=402] And that gets exciting because when churches work together, great things happen and we're beginning to do that.
[time=408] We're also talking about Europe in the post-communist era.
[time=412] The amount of people who don't even know who Christ is is immense and it's too big for one church to try to bring the gospel and saturate that community with the graphic gospel.
[time=425] And so the chapel and Black Hawk are in talks about joining together, sending teams from Black Hawk and from the chapel together to go be the hands and feet of Christ and share the gospel to an area that desperately needs it.
[time=437] And so I'm very grateful for Black Hawk. I love being at the chapel and I love being in a community where churches work together in a collaborative way.
[time=445] If you're new to the Bible Hour, welcome home and enjoy the episode.
[time=467] There I find you in the mystery, an ocean's deep, my faith will stand.
[time=481] But now you'll call upon me, and keep my eyes above the wings.
[time=494] When oceans rise, my soul will reseal the breeze.
[time=500] For I am yours, but you are mine.
[time=521] Grace about the deepest waters, your sovereign hand will be my guide.
[time=535] My faith will fail, your faith surrounds me. You've never failed, and you won't start now.
[time=549] And I will call upon me, and keep my eyes above the wings.
[time=562] When oceans rise, my soul will reseal the breeze.
[time=568] For I am yours, but you are mine.
[time=587] You are mine.
[time=591] If you really knew where my trust is without borders, let me walk upon the waters, wherever you would call me.
[time=616] Take me deeper than my feet could ever wonder, and my faith will be made stronger
[time=626] in the presence of my Savior.
[time=631] Spirit, leave me where my trust is without borders, let me walk upon the waters, wherever you would call me.
[time=645] Take me deeper than my feet could ever wonder, and my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Savior.
[time=662] Spirit, leave me where my trust is without borders, let me walk upon the waters, wherever you would call me.
[time=677] Take me deeper than my feet could ever wonder, and my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Savior.
[time=692] Spirit, leave me where my trust is without borders, let me walk upon the waters, wherever you would call me.
[time=707] Take me deeper than my feet could ever wonder, and my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Savior.
[time=727] My Jesus, you're my God.
[time=749] And I will call upon your name, and keep my eyes above the waves.
[time=762] When oceans rise, and my soul will rest, and your embrace, for I am yours, and you are mine.
[time=792] At this time, I'd like to introduce Dave Walters. Dave is our speaker today. Dave is our friend. He's also a friend of Blackhawk.
[time=803] Dave attended here for about 10 years. He was on staff for about five or six years. He was an elder for about five years.
[time=811] His kids attended here, and his wife is still a teacher. So with that, I'd like to introduce Dave Walters this morning.
[time=818] (Applause) Thank you.
[time=824] So a while back, I get a call from Kelly Bird, and he asked me, "Dave, do you believe in free speech?" I went, "Absolutely."
[time=834] He said, "Well, will you give one on March 30th?" I went, "You got me."
[time=840] So when Kelly asked me to speak, the first phone call I made was to Rick Hawks, who's the founding and senior pastor at the chapel, which I'm on staff at the chapel now.
[time=851] Rick was a senior pastor here in the '80s, and so I called him, and I said, "I have some responsibilities on Sunday, but I think I can easily get out of them."
[time=862] Do you have a preference, either way, a strong preference, whether you want me to come to Blackhawk and preach, and without hesitation, he said, "Absolutely go."
[time=872] At any time, the chapel can come alongside and serve and help Blackhawk were in.
[time=878] And so I just want you to know that at the chapel, we think fondly of you, we respect you. We love everything you're doing on this side of Fort Wayne.
[time=889] And so your generosity, especially the gifts that go, the things you do, is a great testament to Christ in this community and for other churches like the chapel.
[time=900] And so I just want you to know that we like Blackhawk, the chapel.
[time=906] I can prove that too, if you an anecdotal story.
[time=911] A couple months after being there, I preached for the first time at the chapel, and I told our leadership that I spent so much time at Blackhawk, it's just become instinctive to say, "Well, we at Blackhawk..."
[time=924] I said, "There's a great chance, a high probability, that when I'm preaching at the chapel, I'm going to say, "We at Blackhawk here, even though I'm at the chapel."
[time=935] And they said, "You know, that's all right, we love Blackhawk, no one's going to be offended, but please don't do that."
[time=942] Three minutes into my sermon.
[time=945] We at Blackhawk, and I stopped, I thought, "Okay, we're at the chapel here." And they laughed and no one was offended, no one walked out and started coming here, I don't think.
[time=954] But I did meet somebody who said they're coming here from the chapel, but we try to send people your way all the time.
[time=961] My wife and daughters are not here. My wife taught here at the high school for 10 years. She just quit this past year, and she's excited.
[time=971] She loved teaching, and she loves not teaching too. So those of you who aren't working anymore can attest to that.
[time=978] My oldest daughter, Jessica, who graduated here, she's at Purdue.
[time=982] She's currently studying abroad in the Czech Republic in Prague, and as soon as my wife and my middle daughter Rachel, who's a senior here, heard that just may be studying abroad, they started saving money.
[time=995] They had an envelope, and they started putting all their money in this envelope because they wanted to go visit her.
[time=1000] Well, it turns out that they saved enough to go over on spring break.
[time=1005] So now Jane, my wife, Rachel, my senior daughter here, is over in Prague visiting Jessica, my junior at Purdue daughter, who's studying.
[time=1015] So they're having a blast, they're sending all kinds of pictures on Facebook, and so my son and I are here, and we love that we're here, and we really do.
[time=1025] We're getting tired of McDonald's, but we do like it here. Right now we're into a series on Mythbusters, and so we're taking five, we as Blackhawk, we're taking five myths, and we're just examining these myths like Mythbusters does on TV.
[time=1044] Now what Adam and Jamie do on TV, if you've seen that show, is they approach these myths, they look at all the objective facts, what do we know to be true, what's the science, and they have all those facts, then they go subjective, what do we think, what are the theories, what are the thoughts, what are the assumptions,
[time=1064] and they list those, and then from those objective and subjective points, they try to replicate a scenario that will either confirm, make plausible, or bust this myth.
[time=1078] And so we're going to take that approach this morning, we're going to look at objective facts, we're going to look at subjective anecdotal evidence, then we're going to make a conclusion whether our myth for today is actually true.
[time=1093] It's confirmed, it's plausible, or it's busted. And the myth we're going to look at today is we deserve to be happy. Hey, how you doing?
[time=1103] By the way, this is like a homecoming for me, I've been gone for just over a year, so there's some new faces here, so there's people I recognize, so if I stop and say hey that's my ADD coming out, just kind of stay with me and let me go, it's like a homecoming.
[time=1117] So that's our myth, we deserve to be happy, so is this true, or is it not true?
[time=1124] So we are creatures of our culture, and oftentimes we believe things that we're being told, and so our culture tells us certain things.
[time=1133] One thing I like to do is look at what do marketing people tell us, if you want to know what social science says about our culture, look at how they market to that culture.
[time=1144] So how are we marketed to? And so I have some slogans, commercial slogans, I picked some of the more famous ones, I'm going to give the slogan, and I want you to yell out either the product or the company behind the product.
[time=1158] Now last time I preached here, I did movie taglines, I'm a huge movie buff, and so someone actually was mad because I didn't do movie taglines at the end of the first service, so this is all I got, so you have to be happy with this.
[time=1172] Okay, here's a newer one, the younger generation may get this one, live in your world, play on ours, PlayStation, I heard someone say PlayStation, we do it all for you, McDonald's, it's the older McDonald's slogan.
[time=1190] Now, go ahead and take a risk and yell out if you think you know what it is, it's okay, we're in church, we can do that.
[time=1198] Have it your way, Burger King, there we go.
[time=1202] Okay, I'm going to leave off the last word on this one.
[time=1206] Doesn't your dog deserve alpo, it doesn't your dog deserve alpo?
[time=1216] Okay, this is a harder one, think what we can do for you, what's that?
[time=1223] It's Bank of America, close.
[time=1226] Okay, here's a famous one, we should get this one, obey your thirst, or the way they say it, obey your thirst.
[time=1233] Sprite.
[time=1236] The last one, you deserve a break today, McDonald's, that's the older one from the 80s.
[time=1242] So all these slogans, what do they have in common?
[time=1245] It's me, it's all about me, it's either what I deserve, what I want, what my dog deserves, I mean what, obey your thirst, it's all about me quenching my desire, me being happy, me being satisfied.
[time=1259] So this would tell us that maybe I deserve it, maybe it's not just a want or be good to be happy, but maybe it's a right, I deserve to be happy.
[time=1270] So let's look into this, let's start with the objective points.
[time=1274] We have an easy way to look for objective truth and that's scripture, so for our objective side, we're just going to go to scripture and see what it says.
[time=1282] And does it support that we deserve to be happy? First point, let's go right after it, the wages of sin is death.
[time=1291] So if you have sinned in your life, then you deserve death.
[time=1296] And that's Romans 6, 23, if you just back up three chapters, it says, for all have sinned and falls short of the glory of God.
[time=1305] So between Romans 3, 23 and Romans 6, 23, like good myth busters, Jamie and Adam wouldn't even do this, they would say, if everyone is sinned and you deserve death, if you sin, we all deserve death.
[time=1321] Okay, so objective point number one, not too promising that this is a true statement.
[time=1326] So let's go to the second objective point, because of these, the wrath of God is coming, this comes from Colossians 3, 6.
[time=1334] If you back up one verse, it starts listing what these is, it's sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed.
[time=1346] So if you've ever done one of those things in your past, if you've ever been greedy at a certain time, if you've ever had an evil desire or you've lusted over something, guess what? You deserve God's wrath.
[time=1360] Okay, we deserve happy, it's kind of fallen apart here objectively, let's go to the third point.
[time=1366] Don't be surprised at the fiery trials you are going through as if something strange were happening to you from 1 Peter 4.
[time=1375] So we can deduce from this that if I'm in a situation or circumstance that doesn't produce happiness, I shouldn't be surprised.
[time=1387] So if I'm not supposed to be surprised by being under a circumstance that doesn't bring happiness, then how can I deserve that if it shouldn't be the norm?
[time=1399] So I would think that if I can deserve to be happiness, if I can deserve to be happy, then life should be producing happy situations and circumstances most of the time.
[time=1414] And this is basically saying, don't be surprised if you're not in a happy situation.
[time=1421] Then the fourth point under objective is Jesus neglects to model for us a life that deserves to be happy.
[time=1432] So in the course of Jesus' life, he didn't live in such a way that said, I deserve to be happy.
[time=1442] In fact, he left heaven. He left a perfect relationship with God to come to earth.
[time=1450] He learned a craft to support his family. He became a carpenter. He studied. He was a student.
[time=1456] And that's not always a happy experience being a student.
[time=1459] And then at age 30, he began a calling that he knew was going to lead to torture, to a horrific death.
[time=1470] I'm not sure Jesus had the mentality that I deserve to be happy. In fact, he said, I came to serve, not to be served.
[time=1478] In Philippians 2, he said that when he looked at the situation, he did not consider himself equal to God, something to be grasped.
[time=1489] So Jesus took on a mentality of not to be served, of not a right or entitlement to be happy, but instead to serve and to give.
[time=1499] And so even Jesus didn't model this be happy mindset where I deserve it or I'm entitled to it.
[time=1506] So this is the objective evidence that maybe right now seems to not support it.
[time=1513] But we have this whole subjective side, so let's move over to the subjective side and see, do we have anecdotal evidence that shows otherwise?
[time=1522] The first subjective point I want to bring up is the Declaration of Independence.
[time=1527] And in the Declaration of Independence, it says, we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
[time=1534] that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these rights are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[time=1544] This takes it to a different level.
[time=1547] It's one thing for McDonald's to say, you deserve a break today, go eat our hamburgers.
[time=1553] Because you deserve a break, the responses go eat hamburgers.
[time=1557] However, they somehow made that connection pretty well because we eat a billion of them all the time.
[time=1564] But it's one thing for a company to say, I deserve a break today or I deserve to be happy.
[time=1570] It's another thing for 56 of our founding fathers to not only say you deserve to be happy, but it's a right from God.
[time=1577] And so this would start leading us, okay, well maybe I do deserve to be happy, maybe as an American.
[time=1584] I deserve to be happy because it's an unalienable right that God has given us, our Creator.
[time=1590] So let's dig into this a little deeper.
[time=1593] Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, it's given in that order for a very specific reason.
[time=1598] And it's interesting that every law of our land is designed to protect these in this order.
[time=1606] Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[time=1610] Your life is protected from my pursuit of happiness or my liberty.
[time=1616] If I think it'd be happy that you're dead, if I'd be happier with you gone, I don't have the right to take your life.
[time=1623] Because your life trumps my liberty or my pursuit of happiness.
[time=1628] Your freedom trumps my pursuit of happiness.
[time=1631] So as we look into this life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness, if I deserve to be happy, there's a lot of qualifiers to that.
[time=1639] It can't take your life, it can't take your freedom, and it can't infringe on your happiness to a point.
[time=1647] And so even the founding fathers, even though they said we have this unalienable right from God to pursue happiness,
[time=1654] there's so many qualifiers around it, it's hard to make it a deserve, an entitlement, or a right.
[time=1661] So even subjectively, this one we get into problems here.
[time=1666] Let's move on.
[time=1669] The other subjective point I'd want to make is it's not the experience of most people.
[time=1674] Most people are not happy.
[time=1677] And when we talk about happiness, we're talking about happiness that comes from circumstances or situations.
[time=1682] Most people in our world are not in a situation or a circumstance that produces happiness.
[time=1689] One out of eight people on earth do not have enough to eat, they go to bed hungry.
[time=1695] Every ten seconds, a child dies of a hunger-related disease.
[time=1702] In 2011, 19,000 children died from malaria, from pneumonia, and from diarrhea.
[time=1712] All three of which are preventable.
[time=1714] None of us will die from that, they're preventable.
[time=1717] 19,000 kids and 2,000 of their lives were ended by a preventable disease.
[time=1722] 1.7 billion people lack clean water.
[time=1728] And 22,000 children die every day due to poverty.
[time=1734] I'm not sure most people would say, "I deserve to be happy and I am."
[time=1740] So the experience of most people are not happiness.
[time=1748] Okay, let's move on.
[time=1753] In India, there's a picture showing up with this girl lifting her hand.
[time=1758] She's praying.
[time=1759] I love this picture.
[time=1760] This comes off as our own Facebook.
[time=1762] Most of you know who as our own is.
[time=1764] They are the organization that you are incredibly generous to this past December.
[time=1770] Ralph Borde leads this.
[time=1772] It's not an orphanage, it's more than an orphanage.
[time=1776] It's a ministry that helps rescue young girls from what I would say is the most hideous and
[time=1783] most evil sin of our generation, and that's the trafficking that's happening with human beings, especially girls, children and women.
[time=1792] And so in India, there's this little orphanage, there's this ministry that's helping girls like this experience God in a way where she can lift her holy hands in prayer.
[time=1802] Unfortunately, the truth is she's an exception.
[time=1807] The norm is this other girl who's about to be trafficked.
[time=1815] I had a privilege of being in India a number of years ago with Ralph and we first met in Chicago and this is right when he was just about to start and this other friend of mine and we got to go up there and help him with some strategy.
[time=1827] He has this huge vision of how he can change India and the world by ending and eradicating
[time=1833] the sex trafficking among us.
[time=1835] It's an incredible vision and so we were helping him with strategy and later on we went over there and it's an incredible thing but he took us into the brothels.
[time=1847] And he along with this other woman who used to be, who used to actually work in the brothels, come to Christ, they go there and they build relationships with these moms, with these women who are working in the brothels and they're trying to get their daughters out.
[time=1862] And so they're trying to get these daughters before it's too late to say let us raise your daughter and then we'll raise her in a Christian environment, she'll have food, she'll have a Christian education, learning English, most of them go off to college.
[time=1875] It's an amazing story of what happens with these girls when they're out of the brothels.
[time=1879] But you have to reach them early and the woman has to agree to it, the mom has to agree to it.
[time=1885] And what's happening is that the woman will work in the brothel and at some point in time
[time=1891] she becomes so disease ridden that she's no longer useful.
[time=1896] And so the brothel owners, what they will do is they'll say here's how kind they are.
[time=1902] They'll say we'll take care of you, we'll put you up an apartment, we'll feed you for the life and we'll give you medication.
[time=1910] And the medication oftentimes is really nothing but sugar pills.
[time=1914] And so she'll have a disease that will eventually end her life.
[time=1917] Well she has no money, so here's the terms they offer.
[time=1921] We'll take care of you, just give us your daughter.
[time=1925] And most of the time they do because they have no other option.
[time=1929] So Ralph comes in with this woman and says no give us your daughter now, we'll raise her.
[time=1935] And so now the daughter's safe.
[time=1939] So we were in this brothel and there's one woman that he wanted to talk to that they were building a relationship with and she was there so we got to meet her and her daughter comes out.
[time=1949] And she was about eight or nine years old and she was wearing this yellow dress.
[time=1953] She had these bright white eyes and this white teeth when she smiled, she was real innocent.
[time=1959] And if you've been to India and you've seen some of these little Indian kids, they are adorable, they're so cute.
[time=1965] I mean look at her, both of them, just adorable.
[time=1968] And she was so innocent and I thought this is, this girl's incredible.
[time=1972] I said, Ralph, how old is she?
[time=1974] And she was nine years old.
[time=1976] I said, how long does she have before she's put into service?
[time=1980] And he goes, probably about two years.
[time=1982] We have about a year and a half to two years.
[time=1984] I said, do you think this is going to happen where you at with a mom?
[time=1987] Because we've just started with a mom and it's about a two year process sometimes.
[time=1991] So, I don't know if we're going to save this one.
[time=1993] I'm not sure we're going to get to this one.
[time=1995] And so I asked, if I wanted to buy her, how much would it cost?
[time=2001] And he goes, about a thousand dollars.
[time=2006] A thousand dollars.
[time=2008] For a thousand dollars, you could change the trajectory of this young girl's life.
[time=2013] My guess is most of us within 24 hours could come up with a thousand dollars to save this girl's life.
[time=2020] And Ralph told me, but Dave, what you don't understand, what will happen with that thousand dollars.
[time=2023] You save this one girl.
[time=2025] They'll take that thousand dollars and they'll buy four more.
[time=2028] So you enslaved four other girls by saving this one.
[time=2031] It's not the right approach.
[time=2034] But I kept thinking of the girl in the yellow dress.
[time=2037] What about her?
[time=2039] And so when I think about, I deserve to be happy.
[time=2043] I think about the girl in the yellow dress and the 27 million other girls in yellow dresses
[time=2051] who are about to have their life radically changed.
[time=2057] And I would say this, praise God for a ministry like Azar own, for a leader like Ralph Borde.
[time=2064] And Blackhawk, thank you so much for your generosity to move their mission forward, to allow them to help more kids.
[time=2072] And for those of you who have went and gone there and seen what's going on, I would encourage you if you ever have an opportunity to take a week or so off and go to India on a missions
[time=2083] trip through Blackhawk to Azar own, do it.
[time=2086] Go for it.
[time=2087] It'll change your life probably more and it'll change any of them.
[time=2095] Next objective point, talking about it's not the experience of most.
[time=2103] This past October, we sent a team over.
[time=2106] I know, did I even introduce myself?
[time=2108] I'm at the chapel now.
[time=2109] I assume you gathered at by now.
[time=2111] My main responsibility at the chapel, among other things, is everything that happens outside the four walls of the chapel,
[time=2118] I'm somewhat responsible for.
[time=2120] So the missions trips that happen, the teams we send out locally, the partnerships we have, you know, that's me.
[time=2127] I'll go to this here in a second.
[time=2130] I want to bring up a Hope Center.
[time=2132] Here's what's really cool.
[time=2133] A partnership between Blackhawk and the chapel.
[time=2137] Blackhawk has probably two or three people who actually work at a Hope Center.
[time=2141] A Hope Center is a ministry here in Fort Wayne.
[time=2143] It's a medical clinic for girls going through crisis pregnancy.
[time=2147] Not just girls, but the couple, the young couple.
[time=2150] And so they're an advocate, they do aftercare.
[time=2153] It's just an absolutely amazing ministry.
[time=2157] Two years, a year and a half ago, the chapel had the opportunity through some year-end giving
[time=2163] to buy some ultrasounds for them, some 3D ultrasounds.
[time=2166] And what's cool is that 94% of girls who see the ultrasound of their child growing in their baby
[time=2174] choose to keep the baby.
[time=2176] And they're doing an amazing thing.
[time=2178] Blackhawk has two or three people who work there, and I was made aware that they're running low on some items that they use and they help for aftercare like diapers.
[time=2188] And so I stand up a couple weeks ago at the chapel and say, "Hey, if you can, can you bring some diapers next weekend?"
[time=2195] Because the Hope Center, they're running low and they want to really put their money with their mouth so when girls choose to keep the baby, they really want to come alongside them.
[time=2204] And can we help them out with baby bottles, diaper wipes, and diapers?
[time=2207] Well, the next weekend we had 13,000 diapers to deliver to a Hope Center.
[time=2213] And so this past week, I go in there and this is kind of a comical, Sherry-Marie-Z was there.
[time=2218] And I have a couple boxes of diapers and I said, "Where do you want these?" And they go, "Oh, just put them on that table right there." I went, "No, I don't think you get it.
[time=2226] This is not it. Where do you want these?" And so we filled up their conference room and I have a picture of it.
[time=2233] It's pretty cool and they were overwhelmed and I just love being in partnership with churches like that.
[time=2238] And so I'm actually working with some chapel people and working with Blackhawk people to possibly
[time=2245] follow Corbin and Josh Howard over to Europe and maybe how cool would that be?
[time=2249] My dream would be that chapel people and Blackhawk people are going on teams together to help reach Europe for Christ through what Corbin's doing and Josh Howard is doing.
[time=2259] And sending teams over to Punea, India with Azar own to train, to care for, to love on, to provide leadership or whatever Azar own needs.
[time=2267] I love it when churches work together.
[time=2269] I think God does something incredible when they do that.
[time=2272] I'm so thankful for a church like Blackhawk and a church like the chapel who love Christ who are committed to the Word and who care about their communities.
[time=2280] So thank you for being that.
[time=2282] That's my ADD thing. That was kind of off-subjecting in a little bit.
[time=2285] So we'll go right back on topic. So remember we're Mythbusters.
[time=2289] We deserve to be happy. We're looking at subjective points.
[time=2292] It's not the experience of most.
[time=2294] So I sent a team to China in October and we've been going to the same place, the same orphanage in China.
[time=2301] The picture is going to come up here.
[time=2303] And we've been able to build a relationship with the government official in China who's ahead of all adoptions.
[time=2310] And through the teams that have gone and they were being Christ and just serving and asking for nothing in return, we have a video interview of this Chinese government official in charge of adoptions, communists, atheists saying the best situation for Chinese orphans is to be adopted by Christian Americans.
[time=2334] That's a Chinese government official.
[time=2337] And so we've been going to the same place and we keep hearing this rumor about this thing called a death room or a dying room.
[time=2346] It's for kids who are orphans who are so sick, they put them in this room and just let them die.
[time=2352] They quit feeding them. They quit caring for them.
[time=2354] They turn out the lights and just let them die.
[time=2356] And so we had a team there last October who thought there was this door that they think that might have been a death room. They weren't sure.
[time=2364] And so they went there and they started heading towards that door and the whole staff of this orphanage surrounded them and distracted them to come the other way.
[time=2372] So these ladies got real creative and they came up with a plan of how we're going to get in that door and see what's going on.
[time=2379] And so the next day, two of our ladies distracted their whole staff and one of our team members who's an RN went into that room and it was a death room.
[time=2390] And she got in there and turned on the lights and she heard this gurgling over in the corner.
[time=2397] And she found out it was this guy right here.
[time=2400] He's eight years old. His name is Moses and he has a sickness.
[time=2405] But right away her nursing training, she realized this is a preventable disease, but we have about 24 hours before this young boy dies.
[time=2415] And so they talked to the hospital staff and says, "We've got to take care of this." And they really didn't want to.
[time=2419] They were still trying to get them out of the room and says, "We're not leaving. This boy needs help." So they finally agreed and all the medical clinics that they were aware of were closed or they were full.
[time=2431] There's no one who could take care of them.
[time=2433] And so one of the women had just adopted a Chinese baby using Stephen Curtis Chapman's Foundation.
[time=2439] And so she called them and said, "We know you have clinics in China.
[time=2444] Here's where we're at. How close is a nearest clinic?" He goes, "You're not going to believe this. It's 40 minutes away." So they turned to the Chinese officials and said, "We need to take this baby to this clinic. We'll take care of the cost." Well, that baby right now, it looks nothing like him.
[time=2461] I wish I'd have a picture of him today.
[time=2464] He's about to be adopted by a Christian American couple.
[time=2468] And he's alive. He's doing well.
[time=2470] But that's an exception.
[time=2472] The norm are kids who are unwanted in an orphanage who sometimes will end up in a death room.
[time=2480] It's hard for me to stand up here and say, "I deserve to be happy when that is a normal thing going on." Not just in China, but even in Africa.
[time=2488] Many of you have been to a new life.
[time=2490] Kelly and I, we went on a vision trip to go first visit there and some of the stories we heard, the 300 babies abandoned every day in Nairobi.
[time=2500] We live in a world that does not support the idea that I deserve to be happy.
[time=2505] And eating hamburgers isn't going to do it.
[time=2508] It's not the experience of mostly.
[time=2512] Let's even come home to our community.
[time=2514] Fort Wayne, we think Fort Wayne, what a great city.
[time=2516] We love being here.
[time=2517] Maybe you'd rather be in Florida right now, but thanks for being here anyway.
[time=2520] But we love this city. I love this city.
[time=2523] Yet this past year, we broke the record on the number of homicides.
[time=2528] So I was talking with a government official, a city official, and I said, "What can the church do to help?" I mean, this is a problem that we need to do something.
[time=2538] And there's great people in this community.
[time=2540] There's people doing great work.
[time=2542] But this is unacceptable.
[time=2544] It's unacceptable that we have 44 homicides in the Fort Wayne area.
[time=2548] I mean, we got to do something.
[time=2549] What can the church do to help?
[time=2551] And he just stared at me like, "I've never been asked that before."
[time=2557] His answers were more circumstances.
[time=2561] And what I would say, the answer is not circumstances.
[time=2567] But we have an answer that can really help.
[time=2570] And so here's my transition point.
[time=2572] So we've talked about the objectives.
[time=2575] Getting loud noise is about to come, okay?
[time=2577] So we're going to conclude.
[time=2579] Was it confirmed? Was it plausible?
[time=2581] Or was this myth busted?
[time=2583] Okay, I warned you.
[time=2588] See, I warned you, did I not?
[time=2592] So here's the answer.
[time=2595] So in Mythbusters, Jamie and Adam, about this time, we're about 40 minutes through the show.
[time=2602] They don't end the show right there.
[time=2604] They blow stuff up.
[time=2605] Do they not?
[time=2606] If you know the show, they're there just to blow stuff up.
[time=2608] So they know within five minutes whether this myth is busted, then they spend the rest of the time just, I remember watching one episode, and they blew up a cement truck.
[time=2617] They filled the back end with C4, and I don't even know what they were trying to do.
[time=2621] But they busted the myth and said, "Let's blow this thing up," and so they blew it up.
[time=2626] So that's where we're at right now.
[time=2628] So let's just assume, and I think we proved that we deserve to be happy is a myth.
[time=2634] It's not true. It's nowhere found in Scripture.
[time=2637] And just life does not seem to support it.
[time=2640] So then what is true?
[time=2642] What is true is that joy.
[time=2645] It's about joy is available to everyone.
[time=2651] So going back to the city, when the government officials said, "Well, what about this? What about this? What about this?" I said, "I'm not sure we're the experts to do anything on circumstances, but I'll tell you what we can do." It's about joy.
[time=2665] In the 1800s, some of our best hymns that had joy in it were written.
[time=2670] And they were written by slaves.
[time=2672] Martin Luther King quoted one on his speech in Washington, when he said, "Free at last, free at last.
[time=2678] Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last." And guess what he went on to do?
[time=2683] Talk about his dreams.
[time=2685] There's something about when you have joy that comes from within, joy that comes out of your heart, a byproduct of that joy is hope.
[time=2695] And so what I told this government official, I said, you know, when someone has joy coming from within, hope is a byproduct.
[time=2703] I'm not the expert. You're the expert here.
[time=2705] So here's what I would suggest.
[time=2706] My theory would be this.
[time=2708] It's really hard to pull a trigger when you have hope for your future.
[time=2713] That's what the church can do.
[time=2715] And so let me ask you again, how can we help bring joy that brings hope, that brings better choices?
[time=2721] And we had a great dialogue after that.
[time=2724] And so joy is the answer, joy is available to everyone.
[time=2728] So where is it?
[time=2730] Joy is found in relationships, not circumstances.
[time=2734] It's about community.
[time=2736] And so when you're in community, great things happen.
[time=2740] So let me ask you this question.
[time=2743] Think about a high time in your life.
[time=2745] We all have highs and lows.
[time=2747] Think about one of your highest highs.
[time=2750] What were the circumstances surrounding your highest high?
[time=2755] My guess is you have great relationships with people in those high highs.
[time=2760] If you go to the opposite and you go to the lowest lows, what were some of those lowest lows?
[time=2766] It's probably some type of relational issues going on, a struggle, a separation, a death.
[time=2776] Relationships are everything.
[time=2777] We find joy in relationships.
[time=2779] Now, let me draw caution here.
[time=2781] What I did not say is we find joy in a relationship.
[time=2787] When I work with high school students and college students and I did that here, oftentimes what I would talk about is guys don't need a girl underneath your arm to be happy.
[time=2801] Girls don't feel like you need a boyfriend to be satisfied.
[time=2805] Marriage is not the key to happiness.
[time=2808] Or joy.
[time=2810] That guy is not going to bring you happiness.
[time=2815] You don't need them.
[time=2816] Now, does marriage bring joy?
[time=2819] Let me go on record to say yes, it does.
[time=2821] I'm happily married, very happily married.
[time=2824] And so if my wife is even listening, we stream this live, I just found out.
[time=2828] So if she's listening to this, I'm still very happily married.
[time=2831] Maybe not eating as well as she wants me to.
[time=2833] If you knew how she eats, you know that McDonald's is like a sin in our home.
[time=2838] But relationships is where joy comes from.
[time=2841] It's that community.
[time=2842] When our small group started, it was so awesome because I was off speaking somewhere and something happened in our family.
[time=2850] And I remember Lance Clark texted me and said, "Hey, we're sitting here with your family.
[time=2854] We're surrounding and we're praying for you." And there's Lance right there.
[time=2858] And I thought, how incredible is this?
[time=2861] That I'm away from my family and I have three or four other guys who are, from my perspective, are like protecting my girls.
[time=2869] And it was incredible.
[time=2870] It was that community that's awesome.
[time=2873] I was in China this past November, and Rick Hawks and I went, and we trained some underground church pastors.
[time=2883] And so six of us went total, and we stayed at this really nice hotel.
[time=2888] And four of our team members, they were supposed to be somewhat loud, dress loud, and so they'd get up in the morning and they'd go tour.
[time=2896] So we were all here to tour China.
[time=2898] But Rick and I would get up much earlier when it was still dark out.
[time=2901] We'd sneak out, go to this place where we were going to do training, train them all day until it got night, and then we'd sneak back into the hotel.
[time=2909] And our four friends, they were the front.
[time=2911] They were our tourist front.
[time=2912] So they were the loud Americans.
[time=2914] So sorry, you got stereotyped through us, but, you know, we are.
[time=2918] And it was amazing that when we're with these underground church pastors, the community that they have together was amazing.
[time=2925] And it had nothing to do with their circumstances.
[time=2927] I remember asking one, I said, do you ever fear that you're going to get caught and put in prison?
[time=2933] He goes, oh, I've been in prison before.
[time=2936] You have?
[time=2937] Do you fear that they're ever going to torture you?
[time=2940] Oh, yeah, little torture.
[time=2941] We'll get tortured.
[time=2942] I've been tortured before.
[time=2943] It's no big deal.
[time=2944] I'm thinking, no big deal.
[time=2945] I mean, I got sick one morning and thought I was persecuted, and here they are.
[time=2949] They're getting persecuted for their faith, but the community they have with one another is incredible.
[time=2955] The joy they have is amazing.
[time=2958] The other thing about joy is it's a byproduct, not an end in itself.
[time=2965] I was with John, who's a Chinese national, and he sneaks in the Burma, trains some underground church pastors in Burma, and walks back through the woods, through the land, over at Creek, walks about a day, back and forth.
[time=2980] I was with him, and it was probably the most terrified I've been in a long, long time.
[time=2986] We were traveling just the two of us.
[time=2989] We were traveling through the ghetto of one of the cities in China.
[time=2995] Now, it's one thing to be a ghetto in America.
[time=2998] It's another thing to be in a third world and say, and you're in the ghetto of the third world.
[time=3004] I was there, and I was on this train with John, who could speak pretty good English, not great English, but pretty good English.
[time=3011] He was with me, but he would get up and walk away.
[time=3014] It was a train that had multiple cars on it, and so he gets up and walks,
[time=3020] and he's walking back and forth, and he's just talking to people, singing, and then he walked out of my car into another car.
[time=3029] I'm thinking, okay, I'm the only foreigner on this train.
[time=3033] Everybody's Chinese.
[time=3034] They're all staring at me, because many of them have never seen up close a real, white person.
[time=3040] I'm starting to get scared, and you may not have ever known this before.
[time=3046] I read about it, but I never experienced it, but when you get really, really, really scared, you sweat this really stinky stuff.
[time=3055] I don't know.
[time=3056] In your life, I'm like, you've experienced it, but when you get scared, your body emits the sweat, and it really is rank.
[time=3064] I remember sitting there and I thought, what is that smell?
[time=3068] I mean, who is that?
[time=3069] It's me.
[time=3070] I remember reading about that before, and I thought, am I that scared for my life
[time=3076] that this is happening to me?
[time=3078] I think it's one of those...
[time=3079] Is that when a predator comes like a skunk, you kind of...
[time=3083] I wonder if that was going on, am I that scared?
[time=3086] There's only one other time that I felt that scared, and this is when I shared the Gospel of Gene Katie.
[time=3090] I think I told that story here a while back.
[time=3093] But I'm on this train that's, again, ADD went aside.
[time=3097] We're back now.
[time=3098] So this guy's walking up and down the aisle of our train, and he's just singing, talking, and I said, John, what's going on in your life
[time=3107] that makes you so happy and loud?
[time=3110] And he goes, oh, Jesus, Jesus in my heart, that truly was a byproduct.
[time=3116] He said, Jesus and joy was a part of that.
[time=3119] He wasn't trying to find the happiness and trying to muster it up.
[time=3122] He was just generally just a joyful guy, and it just oozed out of him.
[time=3129] So joy is available to everyone, but it's a byproduct, not an end in itself, and it comes through a relationship with Christ.
[time=3137] And the last thing I'd say is that the joy is available to everyone is through living out your calling, living out your purpose, not through pursuing happiness.
[time=3145] I love the country.
[time=3146] I love our founding fathers, but pursuit of happiness is not the key to happiness.
[time=3150] Joy is the key, and joy comes from within.
[time=3152] It comes through a relationship with Christ.
[time=3155] My wife and I had a privilege of starting a church a number of years ago, and there was a guy who was a Vietnam vet.
[time=3161] His hand was scrunched like this, and his name was Russ.
[time=3164] And when I talked to him, he had an incredible story, and he had some unbelievable experiences in Vietnam, negative.
[time=3174] Some of the things he did, he wasn't a Christian back there, and so what he would tell me is like, "I can never do that." "Oh, I can never do that." And finally I said, " Russ, why not?" And he never would tell me, and I know he had a great story, and I asked him, "Could you just tell your story to us one time?" And he never would, and I had a leadership meeting once.
[time=3194] There was probably a hundred people in the room.
[time=3197] And right before I was about to begin, Russ raised his hand and says, "Can I say some things first?" Russ absolutely, go ahead.
[time=3204] And he said, "Because of the things I did in Vietnam and the things I experienced, I thought God would never accept me.
[time=3215] There's no place for me in the church.
[time=3217] The best my life could get is I'll sit in the back of the church, give my 10%, and that's it.
[time=3224] I could never be used by God ever because of what I had done.
[time=3229] But what I realize now is that the grace of God outreaches
[time=3235] any terrible act I've ever done.
[time=3238] And so it was a life-transforming time for him.
[time=3242] So he had gray hair, he was by 65 years old.
[time=3246] He was by far the oldest person in this church.
[time=3248] Our average age was like 11 years old in this church.
[time=3251] So he was the oldest, he was the grandfather.
[time=3254] All the kids saw him as a grandfather.
[time=3256] And so he would take the bulletins like this and hand them out.
[time=3261] We only had one door for a while.
[time=3262] Then when we moved to two doors, he'd run back and forth.
[time=3265] And that was his ministry, that was his purpose, that was his calling.
[time=3269] Despite all the guilt from his past, there was a joy that came out of him.
[time=3273] He would start bringing candy in a bag for kids and he was grandpa Russ.
[time=3278] And so he became, from my perspective, just a key part of that new church.
[time=3285] Because he provided parents, a grandparent, for their kids when their grandparents were around.
[time=3292] He was just a lovable grandfather figure that all of us want to have.
[time=3298] And that's Russ.
[time=3300] I think Jesus knew that we needed a calling and a purpose.
[time=3305] He was asked, you know, what's the greatest commandment?
[time=3309] And he gave him two commandments.
[time=3311] Love God and love others.
[time=3315] If you're bored in your faith, if you've hit a rut, if this whole idea of walking with God has gotten old to you,
[time=3325] let me challenge you with something.
[time=3329] Yeah, read your Bible.
[time=3330] Yes, pray.
[time=3332] But don't forget to serve, to try to have impact.
[time=3338] And I would challenge you to not just think about raking someone's yard on a big serve day,
[time=3344] but think about the impact you could have in India on the next team that goes to India.
[time=3350] Think about Europe.
[time=3351] When you guys go to Europe and you partner with a Josh Howard or a Corbin Miller in reaching people who don't know Christ,
[time=3359] my daughter was telling me that she's going to school over in that area, in that area where Josiah Venture works.
[time=3366] And she said that 10% of the people here, um, affiliate to a religion.
[time=3372] 10% of them would say it's Christian, and she goes, and Dad, even them, it's, it's not, has nothing to do with Christ.
[time=3379] Most people don't even know who Jesus is, or they've heard some things, it's Christmas.
[time=3384] That's where Corbin's at, Corbin and Tanya.
[time=3386] That's where Josh Howard is at.
[time=3388] Think about what you know, think about what you could bring to them.
[time=3392] So if there's ever an opportunity for you to join a team to go over there, do it.
[time=3398] Guys, a Hope Center, where they oftentimes worked with girls, they're finding a lot more that the dad is tagging along.
[time=3407] And so who's there for that dad?
[time=3409] Who can be an advocate?
[time=3410] Who could be a mentor?
[time=3411] Who could be a dad for that 18-year-old dad?
[time=3415] There's great opportunities there.
[time=3417] Now, again, I just want to thank Black Hawk for not just the impact you've had in my family's life.
[time=3423] And my kids came through here in very formal years.
[time=3426] I appreciate the youth group.
[time=3427] I appreciate this weekend service and everything you've done.
[time=3430] And I also appreciate how you're not an island in your community.
[time=3435] And you want to impact state and lay mire.
[time=3438] You want to impact India.
[time=3441] You want to impact all over Europe.
[time=3443] So thank you so much for everything you're doing, for everything you're going to do.
[time=3447] And I would challenge you who are sitting here.
[time=3450] Go for it.
[time=3451] Do something.
[time=3452] Go change your world.
[time=3453] That's my area.
[time=3454] I'm a go change your world.
[time=3457] What kind of titles?
[time=3458] Who has a title like that?
[time=3459] And so I would just challenge you to get involved.
[time=3463] Read your Bible.
[time=3464] Pray.
[time=3465] Do all those things to love God.
[time=3466] But don't forget.
[time=3468] Be the hands and feet of Christ.
[time=3470] Would you stand with me?
[time=3471] Father, thank you so much for the opportunity and the privilege that we all have to serve
[time=3485] you.
[time=3486] And we don't deserve not just happiness, but we don't deserve to be called your child.
[time=3492] We deserve much worse.
[time=3493] But because of your grace and mercy, not only do you call us your children, but you give us a purpose and a mission.
[time=3500] Thank you that this place collectively for years and years have been faithful to your
[time=3506] Word and faithful to the calling you have on this place.
[time=3512] Thank you for the chapel as well as they're going on right now.
[time=3514] Would you continue to bless them and show them favor as you do this place?
[time=3519] And I pray for all of us Lord.
[time=3521] Would you just give us what our next step could be to serve you, to know you more.
[time=3527] Thank you for the leadership here.
[time=3530] Give them wisdom as they continue to move forward.
[time=3532] And Jesus, it's your great name.
[time=3534] We pray.
