[time=839] [MUSIC - 72 seconds]
[time=919] God let us find ourselves in our place this morning.
[time=923] [MUSIC]
[time=926] What we recognize that there's nothing that we could do.
[time=929] [MUSIC]
[time=931] That could repair the mess of things that we make with our sin.
[time=934] [MUSIC]
[time=937] It's only through your son.
[time=938] [MUSIC]
[time=940] It's only through the sacrifice you made that can make things right.
[time=944] [MUSIC]
[time=947] God let us not live in our own strength.
[time=950] [MUSIC]
[time=954] God let us accept your mercy, accept your grace.
[time=957] [MUSIC]
[time=961] God, we thank you for those things.
[time=963] [MUSIC]
[time=967] It's a name we pray, amen.
[time=969] [MUSIC]
[time=981] Well, good morning.
[time=984] As they're passing the offering plate, I'll just again quick introduce myself.
[time=989] I'm Josh Rang.
[time=991] I'm a member of the teaching team here at Blackhawk.
[time=996] So I have the privilege of just open up the word for us this morning.
[time=1001] Glad that each and every one of you are here.
[time=1005] Those of you that may be listening online or even watching live, I'm thankful that you're listening.
[time=1014] We're in a series called Myth Busters and show tackling issues that might
[time=1021] confront us and kind of tackling the myth that's behind them.
[time=1026] And so this morning we're tackling the myth.
[time=1029] It's just a real simple.
[time=1031] It's a real simple issue this morning.
[time=1033] How can a loving God allow such pain and suffering?
[time=1038] And so that's what we're going to look at from God's word this morning.
[time=1042] I'm going to encourage you.
[time=1044] I'm going to kind of go from many different passages this morning.
[time=1048] So don't feel like you need to open up your Bible to each and every passage.
[time=1053] Certainly feel free to do that.
[time=1055] But we're going to be looking at several different passages this morning.
[time=1058] And while they're just finishing the offering, let me just pray one more time.
[time=1063] God, we need to again just hear from you this morning.
[time=1066] And again, I just want to confess with my own lips and my own heart that I need you.
[time=1073] One hundred percent.
[time=1077] And I ask that your words would come forth, that you'd minister to each and every one of us.
[time=1083] Or we do eagerly anticipate the work of your spirit, the spirit of truth,
[time=1090] to enlighten our eyes and to help us see glorious things from your work.
[time=1097] It's in Christ's name that we pray these things. Amen.
[time=1101] Well, it actually was right up here some 19 years ago, August 4th, 95.
[time=1108] And I was here and Paul was here, my wife, and we got married, August 4th, 1995.
[time=1116] And we packed up our U-Haul, having just graduated from Cedarville University, go jackets.
[time=1121] And we headed out to California.
[time=1125] And we didn't have much in the U-Haul, it was a small U-Haul, but we headed out and we were ready, signing up, got whatever you want from us, we are in.
[time=1133] We want to serve you vocationally, and so we went to the master's seminary out in California.
[time=1139] And yes, thank you, Jesus.
[time=1142] And then had a great time out there, had every intention of coming back to Fort Wayne,
[time=1149] and yet had an opportunity to serve at a church in California as a youth pastor.
[time=1154] And so we did that for two years, and from there, we had an opportunity to go to Mobile, Alabama.
[time=1161] So we went from one LA to another LA, which they called it Lower Alabama.
[time=1167] They thought that was real funny.
[time=1169] So we moved to Mobile, Alabama, and again, we're there to do a student ministries pastor.
[time=1174] And again, just saying, "God, we're here, we want to invest in this place, and we want to invest in this ministry."
[time=1181] And a week into it.
[time=1186] Paula, my wife, came down with the worst headache that she had ever experienced.
[time=1193] Actually sent us to the emergency room, and nothing could really help.
[time=1200] And so as we went through that, they diagnosed it several different things, but it ended up, kind of what we kind of hung on to was this thing called daily chronic migraine.
[time=1210] And so in the midst of that, I was about three years long, that she had the same headache,
[time=1218] this migraine headache that just never went away.
[time=1222] So that first year, life really just kind of came to a halt.
[time=1228] And she didn't really get out of the house at all that first year, except to go to different doctors,
[time=1235] and we just kind of hoped to find one that would somehow explain to us what was going on.
[time=1243] And hopefully just find one that could just have the secret that could somehow just end that headache.
[time=1253] And I remember that first year, even just at night, just kind of crawling into bed and just trying to stay completely still.
[time=1261] Because I didn't want her to have to move, and any kind of movement that I had might bring more discomfort for her,
[time=1267] because it was just the type of thing, you know, try to keep the lights dim and keep still.
[time=1273] And this headache just went on and on and on.
[time=1277] And so I remember many of those nights just thinking, "God, I just don't understand." It just doesn't make sense to me.
[time=1285] I mean, we're here to, you know, we're serving you, we're here in ministry, we've given our lives to you,
[time=1292] and yet there's just no relief.
[time=1295] I don't understand.
[time=1300] So eventually it started to get a little bit better, and the second year and the third year got a little bit better,
[time=1307] and then we moved to Kenosha, Wisconsin and pregnant with our first child, and boom, it was gone.
[time=1316] She still struggles with it a little bit here and there, but it's nothing that's chronic.
[time=1321] But I tell you, in those days, it was just questions.
[time=1326] I don't understand.
[time=1328] Why is she in so much pain?
[time=1331] God, could you let me take some of that pain?
[time=1334] On and on and on, the questions and scenarios and thoughts in my mind just continue to be mold over,
[time=1340] and you just come to an end where you just say, "I just don't get it.
[time=1344] I don't get this." Everybody, sure I could talk with each and every one of you, has some kind of suffering.
[time=1355] Everybody in his or her life could be relational pain.
[time=1360] It could be a health issue. It could be the loss of a loved one, the circumstances of a natural disaster that break in, or even political suffering or injustice.
[time=1372] It could be just the decisions that you've made in your own life that have led to difficult circumstances.
[time=1380] You see, pain and suffering is a respecter of no one.
[time=1386] And to each individual in the moment of his or her suffering, it is their biggest deal.
[time=1394] Yes, we would all agree that there are levels of pain and there are degrees of suffering.
[time=1399] However, while one is in the midst of it, it is the biggest pain to him or to her.
[time=1407] So we all have some sort of vested interest in this topic.
[time=1411] There are people right now here in this room who are dealing with utterly difficult circumstances.
[time=1418] Pain and heartache.
[time=1423] So the question ultimately of this, myth boils down to this, comes down to a couple main thoughts.
[time=1429] If God allows such pain and suffering to continue, because he can't stop it, then he might be good, but he's not all powerful.
[time=1443] If, on the other hand, God allows such pain and suffering to continue because he could stop it, and yet he won't stop it,
[time=1453] then he may be all powerful, but he can't be good.
[time=1458] See, therein lies the problem of evil, the problem of pain, or the question that we're looking at this morning.
[time=1465] How can a good God allow such pain and suffering to continue in our lives, in our world?
[time=1474] It's a question of the ages.
[time=1477] And to think this morning that I could have the capacity to answer this question today, or even to begin to understand it, is at best far-fetched.
[time=1489] However, this morning, what I would like to do, I will attempt to frame our time together, not around this huge scope of a message,
[time=1499] but try to nail it down to frame our time together around the myth that because there is so much suffering in the world, he cannot be all loving.
[time=1509] And we'll spend our time talking about that, because that is simply not true.
[time=1515] No one loves you more or better than he does.
[time=1520] No one has done more for you, or ever will do more than he has.
[time=1527] But the temptation we all face in the midst of trying times, in the midst of times of just despair, of seasons of doubts, sleepless nights, crying out,
[time=1537] sometimes to the air, because it feels just like no one is listening, and no one cares, especially God in those moments.
[time=1545] The temptation is to not believe in God, to draw back, and to say that he cannot exist if he would allow this.
[time=1556] And I would bet that all of us have been there at some point, at some time.
[time=1561] And so my desire in our time this morning is whether you follow God, or whether this morning you're someone who remains skeptical,
[time=1572] my desire is that you would come to see that God's love for you is not squelched or proven empty by pain and suffering.
[time=1583] But on the contrary, that his great love for you is confirmed and present in the midst of pain and suffering.
[time=1594] So in order for us to see this this morning, we'll look at just two realities, two realities.
[time=1601] The first reality is this, that sin entered the world.
[time=1606] And the second reality, falling close on the heels of that sin, is this, that Christ entered the world.
[time=1615] So we'll look at those two realities this morning. The first, the reality number one, that sin entered the world.
[time=1623] You see, suffering was not always a resident of our world.
[time=1629] God created a perfect world where in peace flourished, there was no such thing as shame, there was no violence, there was no pain, there was no suffering.
[time=1641] Creation was in perfect harmony.
[time=1645] Genesis 1, 31 says this and God saw everything that he had made and behold, it was very good.
[time=1654] And there was evening and there was morning the sixth day.
[time=1659] But the bliss ended abruptly in Genesis 3 as Adam and Eve decided to forego God's direction and follow after their own liking.
[time=1672] For God had said of every tree in the garden, you may freely eat.
[time=1676] But of this one tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you cannot eat of it.
[time=1681] For in the day you eat of it, your eyes will be opened.
[time=1686] So in Genesis 3, verses 6 and 7, it says this.
[time=1689] So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise.
[time=1698] She took of its fruit and ate and she also gave some to her husband who was with her and he ate, then the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked.
[time=1711] When sin entered the world, everything changed.
[time=1718] A new perspective, a new set of glasses to see things through, says this in Romans 5, therefore just as sin came into the world through one man and death came through sin.
[time=1730] And so now death spread to all men because all sinned.
[time=1733] And so when sin entered the world, pain and suffering and corruption and death followed right behind.
[time=1742] Sin entered the world.
[time=1745] And this reality has two results.
[time=1747] I'm sure it has more results, but we're going to look at two main results of that this morning.
[time=1751] The first is this, corruption.
[time=1755] Genesis 6, just three chapters later, a few generations from Adam and Eve, and now everything was in mass bedlam, chaos among the earth.
[time=1766] It says this in verses 11 and 12.
[time=1769] Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and the earth was filled with violence and God saw the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
[time=1783] Notice the repetition of the word corrupt three times in those two verses.
[time=1788] Corruption was wide spread.
[time=1792] I'm not a science guy, but it's what happens, right? The second law of thermodynamics, entropy, that things move from order to disorder, right?
[time=1800] From harmony to chaos, it's the natural order of things.
[time=1805] And ever since sin entered the world, there's a downward cycle of our earth.
[time=1814] Corruption, Romans, Paul says it this way.
[time=1818] For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God.
[time=1823] The creation, it says, was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it.
[time=1830] In hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption
[time=1837] and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God, for we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.
[time=1847] See, God's creation is groaning because it's under this slavery or bondage of sin's impact upon it.
[time=1856] And yet one day it's going to be freed from that slavery.
[time=1861] One of my favorite authors in a book called Generous Justice says this about this corruption.
[time=1868] God's rule, under God's rule and authority, it was paradise.
[time=1873] All that ended when humanity turned away from God, rejecting his rule and kingdom.
[time=1880] The third chapter of Genesis spells out the results in comprehensive detail.
[time=1885] Sin entered the world to deface and mar everything that had been made.
[time=1891] Because we became estranged from God, we are also alienated from our true selves.
[time=1896] Our primal self-absorption has led to profound social evil, to war, crime, family breakdown, oppression and injustice.
[time=1909] When we lost our relationship with God, the whole world stopped working right.
[time=1917] The world is filled with hunger, sickness, aging and physical death.
[time=1925] See, sin entered the world. It's a reality.
[time=1928] And one of the results of that is that the whole creation has been corrupted.
[time=1933] It's groaning, eagerly awaiting its redemption.
[time=1937] See, one result of sin entering the world was the corruption of God's creation.
[time=1942] A second result is Satan's temporary reign on earth.
[time=1947] As a result of sin entering the world, Satan is allowed by God to reign on earth for a while.
[time=1955] Ephesians 2-2 describes it as this.
[time=1958] He is the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.
[time=1966] You see, Satan, when sin entered the world, is able now to come and to rule and to reign upon this earth for a while.
[time=1974] And he is wreaking havoc upon this earth and in our lives.
[time=1979] 1 John 5-19 says this, says the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
[time=1987] As such, Satan is doing everything he can to keep us from turning ourselves back to God.
[time=1995] Throughout Scripture, he's defined in many ways, none of them are positive.
[time=1999] But here's what it says in Romans Revelation 12-9, that he is the deceiver of the whole world.
[time=2005] John 8-44 tells us that he is the father of all lies.
[time=2011] In John 10, he's described as the thief, which comes to steal and kill and destroy.
[time=2018] You see, Satan wants nothing less than to deceive us into believing his lies into thinking that we know better than God.
[time=2028] And as a result of that deception, we follow after those lies and follow right into the corruption and the havoc that he brings in our lives, in our families, and in this world.
[time=2042] 1 Peter 5-8 describes him this way.
[time=2045] Our adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[time=2055] See, reality number one is this, pain and suffering were never meant to be a part of God's creation, but sin did enter the world.
[time=2065] And when that door was opened, corruption rushed right through it.
[time=2070] And Satan has been wreaking havoc in our world and in our lives ever since.
[time=2077] And yet, quickly on the heels of that reality, which started in Genesis 3, there's a promise that follows quickly in Genesis 3.
[time=2084] It's a promise of a coming one.
[time=2086] This coming one would actually crush the head of Satan and his havoc.
[time=2093] It brings us to our second reality that right after sin entered the world, the hope of Christ entered the world.
[time=2103] You see, God loves the world.
[time=2107] It says it many different ways and many different times in the Scripture.
[time=2111] God loves the world. He created a perfect world for mankind to live in, full of peace and full of harmony.
[time=2117] This is what it was like before sin entered the world.
[time=2121] He loves us and wants what is best for us and longs for us to be restored in our relationship with him.
[time=2128] But when we see all the chaos and all the dysfunction and when we understand all the disharmony in our lives,
[time=2135] sometimes we wonder how do we know it's true?
[time=2140] It sure doesn't feel like it some days.
[time=2143] And when I turn on the news and I listen to the radio and I hear all the dysfunction and calamity
[time=2150] and death and destruction and missing planes and random shootings and mudslides and tsunamis,
[time=2157] it certainly doesn't seem like God is concerned about our world, does it?
[time=2166] So we ask, how do we know God loves us?
[time=2172] It's not until.
[time=2174] It's not until the incarnation of the Son of God, not until the cross of Christ.
[time=2179] Do we know how far God was willing to go to show off his great love?
[time=2186] Jesus entered the world.
[time=2189] He left the perfect harmony of heaven and came down on this earth.
[time=2194] Perfect relationship with the Father and the Spirit, and yet he left all of that.
[time=2201] To enter into the mess and the dysfunction and the pain and the suffering of this world,
[time=2209] Philippians 2 says it this way, though he was in the form of God.
[time=2212] He did not consider equality with God a thing to be grasped, but he emptied himself, taking
[time=2220] the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men and being found in human form.
[time=2225] He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[time=2231] And so the reality that Christ entered the world leads us to two main results from that reality.
[time=2237] Again, I'm sure there's many other results, but we're going to look at two this morning.
[time=2241] The first reality that flows out of Christ coming into this world is the comfort that he provides.
[time=2249] Listen to what it says in 2 Corinthians 1 verses 3 and 5, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=2256] the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our afflictions,
[time=2262] so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God, for as we share abundantly in Christ's sufferings,
[time=2274] so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too."
[time=2281] You see, Christ has suffered everything we could suffer and more.
[time=2287] And having suffered in such terrible ways, he is now able to relate to and comfort us in our sufferings.
[time=2296] Line up all the religions of the world.
[time=2299] Put them side by side.
[time=2301] Of all of the religions of the world, only Christianity says that in Jesus Christ,
[time=2307] God became vulnerable and subject to suffering and pain and even death.
[time=2312] The very God of the universe humbled himself to come down and plunge himself into the very suffering
[time=2319] that you and I experience and even more.
[time=2323] Only on our cross, only on the cross, to our astonishment we see the work of Christ.
[time=2331] If you're being unjustly persecuted, only on the cross do we see God the subject of unjust suffering,
[time=2338] weakness and death of him being abused and persecuted on the cross?
[time=2343] Or if you've lost a loved one, only to the cross can we look to our astonishment we see.
[time=2350] We see we look up and we see the Father losing his only son.
[time=2358] Or you are just screaming out in pain, God why?
[time=2364] God why?
[time=2365] We look to the cross and there is Jesus screaming out, my God, my God.
[time=2372] Why have you forsaken me?
[time=2376] Or if you can find no sleep or rest through the night and find yourself all alone.
[time=2386] With great astonishment we look to the garden of Gethsemane the night before the cross in the garden when there was no rest found for Jesus.
[time=2394] There was no sleeping and all his friends seemed to not care leaving him alone to deal with his utter anguish and grief.
[time=2404] You see he suffered everything we have ever suffered and more.
[time=2410] In the garden of Gethsemane you see Christ clearly, clearly a man in shock.
[time=2416] Blood coming out of his pores asking God is there some way I can get out of this?
[time=2421] Is there any way, any other way that this cup could pass from me?
[time=2426] And then on the cross saying why have you forsaken me?
[time=2429] You see on the cross his suffering went way beyond the physical.
[time=2435] He was experiencing cosmically what we deserve.
[time=2438] He was being cast out of the very presence of his father and experiencing the full wrath that you and I deserve because of our rebellion against God.
[time=2452] He suffered far more than we can even comprehend. Peter in his first letter likens suffering and trials to the pain of refinement of gold in a furnace, of extreme heat and fire.
[time=2466] He says it this way in 1 Peter 1. In this you rejoice though now for a little while if necessary you have been grieved by various trials so that the tested genuineness of your faith more precious than gold that perishes.
[time=2480] Though it's tested by fire may result in the praise and glory of Jesus.
[time=2486] You see Peter is using a great illustration.
[time=2489] These trials are pain and suffering can be likened to a fiery furnace.
[time=2497] A refinement we feel the heat in very real and tangible ways and sometimes the heat never lightens day after day sleepless night after sleepless night and while I don't know why these fires happen.
[time=2509] I do know that at Calvary Jesus went through his own fiery furnace and the flames of that furnace burned hotter and were more intense than we can even begin to understand.
[time=2524] Now watch this not only did Jesus suffer excruciating pain and loss at the cross going through his firing furnace but because he went through that furnace he continues to suffer with you as you experience the pain and the trials in your fiery furnaces.
[time=2546] In a very real sense he identifies with you and he's with you in the midst of your suffering he goes through it with us.
[time=2557] In a very literal sense he did that in the Old Testament.
[time=2561] Back in Daniel 3 remember the 3 young Hebrew men, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego they refused to fall down and bow down to the idol that the king of Babylon had erected and so the king of Babylon had a furnace heated up extreme temperature so extreme that the guards that got close to that actually died.
[time=2584] But they threw Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego into the fiery furnace and then quickly the king stood up and said wait we threw three and how come there are four and quite literally it was what theologians call a theophany.
[time=2601] The pre incarnate Christ was there with them in the midst of that fiery furnace.
[time=2610] See Christ wasn't going to show up on earth until the New Testament right and yet this was a pre incarnate Christ before his incarnation he was literally there with those three Hebrew young men going through that trial with them.
[time=2627] In the midst of their fiery furnace he was walking through it with them.
[time=2633] He experiences the pain and sorrow he walks through the experiences with us.
[time=2638] Notice how he identifies himself with with our suffering in these two passages.
[time=2642] Saul was on the road to Damascus he was persecuting the church and in Acts 9 it says this as he went on his way he approached Damascus and suddenly a light from heaven shown around him and falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him.
[time=2656] Saul, Saul why are you persecuting me?
[time=2660] See what that said? Why are you persecuting me?
[time=2666] Christ was already up in heaven.
[time=2670] He wasn't physically on the earth. Saul was persecuting the church and yet Christ and God so identifies with his people that he says you're persecuting me.
[time=2682] Matthew chapter 25 parable of the king it says this the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
[time=2694] For I was hungry and you gave me food I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you welcomed me I was naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came to me then the righteous will answer him saying Lord when did we see you hungry and feed you
[time=2710] or thirsty and give you drink and when did we see you as a stranger and welcome you or naked and clothe you and when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you.
[time=2720] The king will answer them and say this truly truly I say to you as you did it to one of the least of these brothers you did it to me.
[time=2730] God is so concerned about humanity about his people that he's willing to identify them in their poverty and in their injustice and in their pain and in their suffering and so when you do it to one another you're doing it to him.
[time=2748] Jesus can I identify with every single one of us in whatever circumstance you might be facing today.
[time=2757] He knows firsthand how to relate and how to comfort.
[time=2761] There is nothing we can experience that he through his suffering has not experienced.
[time=2768] So one result of Christ entering the world is the comfort of Christ.
[time=2772] A second result is that there's a victory secured by Christ.
[time=2778] We won't spend much time on this but I want to read two passages to you through Christ work on the cross.
[time=2784] Christ has defeated death and secured a future without pain and suffering for his people.
[time=2791] 1 Corinthians 15 says this death is swallowed up in victory.
[time=2796] Oh death where is your victory?
[time=2798] Oh death where is your sting?
[time=2800] The sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2807] And then in Revelation when John gets a vision of a new heaven and a new earth that comes he says this in chapter 21
[time=2816] then I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and the sea was no more.
[time=2823] And I saw the holy city new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God prepared as a bride adorned for her husband
[time=2830] and I heard a loud voice from the throne saying behold the dwelling place of God is with man.
[time=2836] He will dwell with them they will be his people and God himself will be with them as their God and get this.
[time=2843] He will wipe away every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore.
[time=2853] The former things have passed away and he who was seated on the throne said behold I am making all things new.
[time=2863] There is a victory that is secured a victory that says one day all of that pain and all of the suffering all that you have experienced
[time=2874] it will come to an end.
[time=2878] See reality number one this morning pain and suffering were never meant to be a part of God's creation but sin did enter the world.
[time=2886] And when that door was open corruption and pain and suffering rushed right through it and Satan has been wreaking havoc in the world and in all of our lives ever since.
[time=2896] Reality number two though Christ entered into our mess and dysfunction experiencing more suffering and pain and isolation than we could ever comprehend.
[time=2906] And because he did this he can comfort us in any affliction as he identifies with us in the midst of our suffering and ultimately his suffering will bring an end to all suffering and his death swallowed up death.
[time=2926] So whether this morning you follow God or you're someone who remains skeptical whether you're sitting here today or listening online I pray that these two realities would help you come to see that his love for you is not squelched
[time=2947] or proven empty by pain and suffering but on the contrary his great love for you is confirmed and present in the midst of pain and suffering.
[time=2961] One of my friends Jason Dalman a pastor in Milwaukee referenced a story in one of his messages which I think would be a fitting conclusion to our time together.
[time=2972] Max Stiles a missionary in the United Arab Emirates and a businessman who used to be a chaplain.
[time=2980] He was called in urgently this max to the hospital on one occasion to visit a woman who may or may not be dying he didn't know but he knew she was in terrible condition.
[time=2992] As he arrived at the hospital as he was walking down the hall to see this woman he was being briefed about what had happened.
[time=3000] He was told that a van pulled up pulled her off the sidewalk pulled her into the back of the van that was a gang of men who treated her rudely shamefully in the back of that van and then threw her out of the back of the van.
[time=3015] Didn't stop didn't slow down like a bag of garbage they threw her out of the back.
[time=3023] She landed in the street the ambulance came they brought her to the hospital she's now lying on a hospital gurney her body shattered ripped apart bleeding and dying.
[time=3035] Max Stiles walks up to her she sees a cross on his shirt and realizes that he's a chaplain she leans over and with what might have been her last words she says this.
[time=3049] Why?
[time=3051] Why did God let this happen to me?
[time=3056] Max describes what he felt like at that moment he writes this he said I stare back at her and I feel frightfully empty.
[time=3066] I'm asking a crescendo of questions myself God you can't let me say nothing here God I have to tell her something.
[time=3073] God why did you let this happen to her God where are you and the last questions of panicky scream inside of me and I don't know what to say and in a flash I realize that's right.
[time=3086] I don't know what to say and so I lean over to her and I say this I don't know why God let this happen to you but I know this evil men took Jesus.
[time=3102] And they did shameful things to him and when they were finished they nailed him to a cross and he died there alone and in pain.
[time=3115] I don't know why God let this happen to you but I do know that Christ knows your pain and that he weeps with you and that he hurts with every ache that you feel.
[time=3126] I do know this he has been through it and he can walk you through this.
[time=3136] She squeezes my hand hope replaces that crazed look in her eyes and she nods and says thank you.
[time=3146] So we end this morning as we began asking how can a good God allow such pain and suffering.
[time=3157] My answer to this morning is to look at the two realities.
[time=3162] God never intended pain and suffering it was never a part of his original creation and to the enormous sufferings of Jesus placed him in a unique position to walk through our sufferings with us better than anyone can.
[time=3178] And ultimately his sufferings will put an end to all suffering one day.
[time=3184] And even though these two realities can't tell us what the answer to our question is they do tell us what the answer isn't they do tell us what the answer can't be.
[time=3197] It can't be that he doesn't love us.
[time=3203] We don't know the reason that he allows and sometimes may bring pain and suffering into our lives but it can't be that he doesn't care or he's remote or indifferent.
[time=3213] Because he came and he plunged himself not just into the fiery furnace of our sufferings but to infinite degrees beyond what we will ever suffer.
[time=3223] He loves us that much. He hates suffering that much that he was willing to come into our world and be plunged into our suffering and experience it so that someday he could end all evil without ending us.
[time=3243] Now don't miss this this morning. All of this is true but the key is whether you believe it or not.
[time=3256] The key is whether you're going to draw away from God in the midst of all that pain and suffering and doubt him or whether you're going to draw in to him.
[time=3270] The one who loves you more than anyone ever could.
[time=3274] The key is to respond to this loving creator by confessing your departure from him, your desire to do life without him.
[time=3284] The Bible calls this sin but Jesus came. He entered the mess, the dysfunction. He came to die for your sin so that you can be restored in your relationship with this loving God.
[time=3302] You see all suffering and pain will come to an end as God creates a new heaven and a new earth but some of humanity will never be restored to this new relationship.
[time=3321] Some will not enter into this new heaven and new earth where there's no pain and there's no suffering. Some will fail to respond to the love of God in Jesus Christ and will be judged for their sin in a place called the lake of fire.
[time=3337] A permanent judgment for those who never confess their sin and believe in the work of Jesus on the cross.
[time=3348] If you don't know him this morning would you come to him? He loves you.
[time=3354] The greatest evidence, the greatest evidence of that love is that he sent his son to redeem you.
[time=3361] Would you be willing to enter into further discussion about this amazing God?
[time=3367] We would love to talk with you further.
[time=3370] Whether it's after the service or whether it's calling or if you're listening online right now, reaching out to somebody, reaching out to us here at Black Hawk Ministries, we would love to talk with you.
[time=3383] So if you know Christ today, would you once again in the midst of whatever pain and suffering that you're going through, would you just be confirmed?
[time=3396] It's not something that you've done. It's not that he doesn't love you.
[time=3404] He's there for you and he wants to comfort you and he identifies with you.
[time=3412] And if you don't know Christ today, would you for the very first time receive his love? Let's pray.
[time=3421] God, thank you so much for the answers in your word. And yet God, this one, this one's deep and this one's hard and it's confusing sometimes and I don't have all the answers in there are still times in my life when I look at all the pain and all the conflict and all the suffering and I just don't get it.
[time=3450] And yet this morning, once again, you've just encouraged my heart with the fact in the midst of all of that, I can trust you. I can trust you in the midst of even the fact that I don't understand all of it.
[time=3462] I don't understand that sometimes you even bring the calamity your word says, but I can trust in even that, that you're good and that you're loving because you have sent your son and we can hide in him and he will walk through all of our suffering with us.
[time=3483] God, thank you so much for loving us through your son Jesus, the power of your Holy Spirit.
[time=3492] God, even now, I just ask that you would allow your spirit to work in the hearts and the lives of each and every one of us.
[time=3501] But God specifically today, someone who might come that is a skeptic that's not sure that hasn't come to Christ. I pray that the truth of your love would cause them to run to you.
[time=3518] Or even to ask more questions, would you help them move along their journey that ultimately hope we would find its end in you? God, thank you for your great love.
[time=3531] Thank you for caring for us. It's in Christ's name that we pray these things. Amen.
