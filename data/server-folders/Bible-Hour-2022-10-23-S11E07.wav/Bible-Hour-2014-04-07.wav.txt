[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] >> Well, hello and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=35] Again, we at Black Hawk Ministries and those of us who are part of this Bible Hour broadcast,
[time=41] we're so grateful that we get this chance, this opportunity, week after week, to bring you what we believe in our hearts is the life-changing, eternity-altering truth of God's Word.
[time=54] We try to sing it and proclaim it.
[time=57] We do our very best to teach it and explain it.
[time=61] But our hope is that as we bring it to you that your heart is open and that you find yourself at a place in life where you are interested in, hungry for, and wanting to hear what God has for you.
[time=73] And so we never take this lightly, and each and every week we're grateful for the chance to hopefully encourage you with what we believe to be the absolute truth.
[time=83] And as you watch this broadcast this morning, this is Resurrection Sunday.
[time=88] We're taping this segment right here.
[time=91] It's Palm Sunday.
[time=92] What a Sunday that was as Jesus comes to Jerusalem, knowing full well what's ahead of him.
[time=98] Knowing the pain, knowing the rejection, knowing the torment, knowing the death that awaited him.
[time=105] But we are encouraged in an odd way.
[time=110] You certainly don't look forward to or you certainly don't celebrate the pain and the torment, but those of us who are believers, those of us who have fully surrendered our hearts and lives to Christ, we look at Palm Sunday.
[time=124] We see his entrance into Jerusalem as something that was really the beginning
[time=130] of our healing and our redemption.
[time=133] This was Jesus saying, "I'm in." This was Jesus saying, "I'm going forward." And so this morning we celebrate his courage and his willingness to follow the will of the Father.
[time=143] And then as you watch this, it's Resurrection Sunday.
[time=147] And oh, how we hope you might join us.
[time=149] Even as you watch this in the morning, there's a 1045 service that will begin in just a couple of hours.
[time=156] And we would love to have you come and be with us.
[time=159] Come live and in person, walk into the room and be a part of what I believe will be an absolutely miraculous celebration of his love and his grace and his goodness to us.
[time=170] So Resurrection Day is an amazing thing.
[time=173] We've been preparing for it as a church and as a family.
[time=176] And I hope that we can celebrate it together on this great day.
[time=180] God bless you.
[time=181] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=193] We will not be shaken.
[time=201] We will not be sighted.
[time=204] Sin is powerless.
[time=207] God is for us.
[time=210] We will not be broken.
[time=213] He won't be beaten dead.
[time=217] His powerless.
[time=219] God is for us.
[time=222] We will not be shaken.
[time=225] We will not be sighted.
[time=228] Sin is powerless.
[time=230] God is for us.
[time=234] We will not be broken.
[time=237] He won't be beaten dead.
[time=241] His powerless.
[time=243] God is for us.
[time=252] [MUSIC - 898 seconds]
[time=1154] So this council of Calcidon a long time ago brought a question this, was Jesus truly a man and was it possible for Christ to be both God and man in one person?
[time=1167] And so again, they were, you know, what the church combined had talked about heretics such as Arius and Eutuchus and they'd been spreading false teaching concerning the person of Christ.
[time=1178] Pope Leo at that time known as Leo the great road of treatise condemning Eutuchus for his heresy and at that time he called for this council to come together.
[time=1190] And again, 600 bishops came together searching the scriptures to determine what they said regarding the humanity of Christ.
[time=1197] Here's what they came up with in a statement known as the Calcidon definition.
[time=1201] The council affirmed one, the full deity of Christ is fully God.
[time=1209] Two, the full humanity of Christ.
[time=1212] Not only was he fully God, but he's fully man as well.
[time=1216] And then three, that Christ is one person, not two people.
[time=1222] So even though he's fully God and fully man that doesn't make him two distinct beings, he's one distinct being that is fully God and fully man.
[time=1230] Which I can't explain that nobody can, it's a mystery, but that's just how that plays out.
[time=1235] And then fourth, the deity and humanity of Christ are not blurred.
[time=1241] So they don't, you can't blur him, I mean, it's not like it's blurring, it's, he's one.
[time=1246] And so that was in 451.
[time=1248] And then we fast forward, you know, again, many years and many centuries and today we've got not only theologians like Martin, you know, Scorsese saying things about Jesus.
[time=1259] But we also have different religions that would say things about Jesus.
[time=1263] We think of, again, Jehovah's Witness, that would say that Jesus was a created being, that he wasn't fully God.
[time=1270] And so this is a topic that's just been going on and on and on and we'll continue to go on.
[time=1276] But to come back as what we're desiring today is to be firm on what we believe that the Scriptures teach about Jesus.
[time=1284] 2465 years ago.
[time=1288] Really?
[time=1289] I don't know.
[time=1290] Okay, 'cause it doesn't sound right.
[time=1292] I'm just messing with you.
[time=1293] Okay.
[time=1294] I'm just messing with you.
[time=1295] Thank you, thank you.
[time=1296] That sounds like that sound.
[time=1298] So, yes.
[time=1300] So, as you can see, like Jesus is just kind of a controversial figure ever since he stepped on planet Earth.
[time=1306] And so to kind of take, you know, the characters from Gladiator and bring them to this year, it's not really gladiator, it just sounded like the people in gladiator.
[time=1313] What are those dudes named?
[time=1314] Ew to kiss.
[time=1316] Polyonius.
[time=1317] This sounds like a gladiator movie with Russell Crowe.
[time=1319] I mean, it's like, boom.
[time=1320] Yeah.
[time=1321] Okay.
[time=1322] So, CS Lewis, I'm not sure who started this, I guess it's called apologetic, but he talks about that, you know, you can't just leave it at Jesus as a man.
[time=1331] That's like the most foolish thing you can say about Jesus.
[time=1335] And the way that it's kind of, it's laid out in this, these four things are kind of our alternatives.
[time=1340] Okay, we kind of come to today and I like it real simple.
[time=1342] And so they all start with the now.
[time=1344] And I didn't make this up, but if you want to give me a claim, that's fine.
[time=1347] The first one is legend.
[time=1348] Okay.
[time=1349] There never was a Jesus who claimed to be God.
[time=1351] Okay.
[time=1352] That's an option.
[time=1353] It was just a legend.
[time=1354] The second one is lunatic.
[time=1355] Jesus really thought he was God, but he was wrong.
[time=1359] Okay.
[time=1360] He's a lunatic.
[time=1361] He's crazy.
[time=1362] He wasn't really quite all together.
[time=1363] The third is liar.
[time=1364] Jesus deliberately deceived people.
[time=1366] Okay.
[time=1367] He didn't, he really didn't, he knew he wasn't God, and so he was just lying.
[time=1371] Or the fourth option is Lord.
[time=1373] He is who he claimed he was.
[time=1375] And I think that's kind of where we're at today.
[time=1377] Those are the four places of the four camps you can land on.
[time=1381] And I think the three of us up here are that he is Lord.
[time=1383] Yeah.
[time=1385] And you know, I've heard that before.
[time=1387] I haven't heard the legend part, but I've heard the lunatic, the Lord, the liar.
[time=1392] Because the reality is, the history books are written, and there is a historical person
[time=1398] from Nazareth named Jesus.
[time=1400] So that lunatic, I mean the first one, legend, I think you throw that one out.
[time=1404] The history books are true.
[time=1405] There was a person named Jesus.
[time=1407] So you can't dismiss him.
[time=1411] You can't say he just never existed.
[time=1413] No, he's in the history books.
[time=1416] He's in the genealogies.
[time=1417] It's real, true history.
[time=1420] And so then it's a question.
[time=1422] If you can't dismiss him, you've got to decide on your own as you search the scriptures.
[time=1426] Okay.
[time=1427] Was he just a crazy person?
[time=1429] Was he just lying and deceiving people?
[time=1431] Or is he actually who he said he was, the Lord of all creation?
[time=1434] And so you just can't dismiss it.
[time=1436] Yep.
[time=1437] So here's how we're going to come out this this morning.
[time=1439] You can follow along.
[time=1440] I hope you'll just write some things down and engage with us on these three fronts.
[time=1445] We're going to look at what Jesus said about himself.
[time=1449] With this whole discussion of was Jesus just a man who was Jesus?
[time=1454] Where do we find the origins of Jesus?
[time=1458] This issue of his divinity.
[time=1460] What did Jesus have to say about himself?
[time=1463] What did others have to say about this issue?
[time=1467] And then lastly, we'll look at what God said about Jesus in terms of his divinity or maybe the lack thereof.
[time=1476] But we're going to do those three things.
[time=1478] What Jesus said, what others said, and what God said in Josh is going to get us started with what Jesus said.
[time=1483] Yeah.
[time=1484] What I love about what Jesus said about himself is that he's just very consistent.
[time=1488] It's a very consistent message which would go back to that liar part.
[time=1492] Usually liars aren't very consistent, right?
[time=1495] You're always trying to cover something and there's not a lot of consistency to it.
[time=1499] Jesus' message about himself was just true from the very beginning.
[time=1503] You go back even to, he was 12 years old and you might remember the story where this was the first time he had gone to Jerusalem,
[time=1510] the Passover and his family with other people had traveled from where they were to go to be there.
[time=1515] They spent days there and celebrated the feast and then on their way back.
[time=1520] And again, pretty understanding because they had a large group of people.
[time=1524] But Joseph and Mary are like, well, hold on a second a day into it.
[time=1527] We don't have Jesus, where is he?
[time=1529] And so they can't find him in their traveling group.
[time=1532] They go back to Jerusalem and there he is in the temple.
[time=1536] And he says to his parents in a nutshell, didn't you know that I would be in my father's house?
[time=1543] And so even from 12 years old as a young man, this Jesus knew who he was.
[time=1550] And he knew exactly that he was divine, that he was the very son of God.
[time=1556] And then as you go through different statements, specifically in the gospel of John, but elsewhere, there's a clarity around what Jesus is saying.
[time=1565] It goes back real quick to how God defined himself in the Old Testament.
[time=1572] In Exodus chapter 3, Moses is supposed to go and declare to Pharaoh, let my people go.
[time=1579] God was using Moses as this messenger, and Moses didn't want to go, and he put up all sorts of objections, but finally he said he goes.
[time=1588] But once he decided he was going to go, he said, well, who do I say is sending me?
[time=1593] And God says in Exodus 3, God said to Moses, I am who I am, say this to the people of Israel, I am has sent you.
[time=1603] In the Old Testament, God defines himself in this way, and the Jews and the Jewish people would know that this statement I am is really a reference to the Creator God, their Yahweh God that they knew.
[time=1615] And then in the gospel of John, Jesus uses that same statement a couple different times.
[time=1623] In John chapter 5, he says this, he's talking to the rulers of the Sadducees and the theologians of that day.
[time=1629] And he answered them, he says, my father is working until now and I am working.
[time=1633] And then he says this is why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him in John 5, 18.
[time=1638] Because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, in John chapter 5 he was healing people on the Sabbath, and the Pharisees were upset with him because he was breaking the law, the 10 commandments.
[time=1650] But he was even calling God his own father, making himself equal with God.
[time=1658] So these rulers of the day knew that he was claiming to be the Yahweh God, and they didn't like it at all, they didn't like it so much that they were willing to try to kill him.
[time=1668] In John chapter 8, he says this, verse 58, Jesus said to these same people, truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was,
[time=1679] I am.
[time=1682] He used the very same statement that God used in Exodus 3, talking about this fact that he has always been.
[time=1691] I am as a statement that says I've been before, I always will be, it's a statement of eternality.
[time=1697] And so Jesus is saying that same thing, he's describing himself as equal to God that he has this characteristic of eternality as well.
[time=1710] And so again, they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hit himself and went out of the temple.
[time=1717] John 10, he said I am the father I won, the Jews picked up stones again to stone him because of his blasphemous words.
[time=1725] And so he's very clear from beginning to end that he indeed was the son of God, full on deity.
[time=1734] And I said first hour how he didn't have a t-shirt that said I'm God, right?
[time=1739] It seems like we talked about it first, I like what you said about it, he didn't just come and kick in the door and be like I'm God, welcome to it, right?
[time=1746] I mean, but he kind of did, he was always, it was there, but you know what I mean, it's there, we see it.
[time=1751] Yeah.
[time=1752] And you said, I said why didn't, but maybe why not?
[time=1755] Yeah.
[time=1756] Well, I think, yeah, it's a great point.
[time=1758] I think Jesus was, and Josh mentioned this first hour, first of all, don't forget, with different people, with different groups of individuals,
[time=1767] Jesus was more clear or less clear.
[time=1770] It was interesting with the false religious leaders of his day, he was blatantly clear.
[time=1775] He declared his kingship, he declared his messiahship, he declared to them his divinity.
[time=1781] Jesse's right though, as you look at Jesus and his approach to the day to day of his life here on earth, he didn't wear a t-shirt.
[time=1788] He proclaimed who he was, but there was something about Jesus that invited people to figure some things out.
[time=1794] There was something about Jesus that invited people to a journey.
[time=1797] There was a desire, I think, in Jesus for people to come along and to realize things as they were in relationship with him versus him just standing up at the head of the class and saying, here's the answer.
[time=1809] And I think he knew as well, he was there on a specific mission.
[time=1814] I mean, he wasn't there necessarily to, I mean, he wasn't some extent to leave an example for us to follow, but he was there to first and foremost accomplish our redemption.
[time=1823] So that by his power, we could follow in his example.
[time=1827] And so there was this essence where he had to, you know, he was strategically moving throughout, you know, his time on the earth because he was, you know, like a flint headed toward Calvary and he knew that.
[time=1839] And so he was very strategic and very intentional.
[time=1842] That's good.
[time=1843] What did others say?
[time=1844] I jumped to Paul, Paul's just dude in the New Testament, he kind of bumps into Jesus on the road.
[time=1852] But before that, he was actually a killer of Christians, what we call who we call the Apostle Paul.
[time=1858] He was against it, he hated it, he wanted to squelch it, he wanted to kill them.
[time=1862] And then he bumps into Jesus on the road and says this radical transformation.
[time=1866] And now he's the proponent, he's the proclaimer, he's going after people then telling them about this Jesus.
[time=1873] And so there's something there in his life, there's an experience, there's a conversion there with Paul.
[time=1878] And then when we read in Colossians 1, 15 to 20 Paul writes this, he said, Jesus is the son of the invisible God.
[time=1886] He is the one in whom and through whom and for whom all things hold together.
[time=1890] And in verse 19 he kind of pulls it all together, he says this, "For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him."
[time=1898] It's pretty clear what Paul's saying there, "For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him Jesus."
[time=1905] And a little later in Colossians 2.9 he says, "For in Christ, same thing, for in Christ all the fullness of the deity lives in bodily form."
[time=1914] I mean Paul is saying that this Jesus is God and God is living in him, it's pretty powerful what he's saying there.
[time=1921] And before you move on there I think it's important because you might hear this, one of the passages that would come up for those that might say that he is created.
[time=1929] You know the Jehovah's Witness might use this, Eucharist used this, Arius used this, Colossians 1 it says that he is the firstborn of all creation.
[time=1937] There's an actual scripture that says that, but when you look again you study the scriptures and you see it in the original language,
[time=1943] that firstborn is actually a Greek word that I love to say, it's called protatikos.
[time=1947] And so it's talking about Jesus as the protatikos and it doesn't mean necessarily firstborn in rank or number, it means a preeminence.
[time=1956] And so I believe as you read Colossians and in that context it's not talking about the fact that he was created,
[time=1962] but it's talking about the fact that he is preeminent over all creation.
[time=1966] And even in that context it talks about him being the creator.
[time=1970] And so God is just, Paul is just defining him in a light that says he's the creator and he is the preeminent one.
[time=1978] And I think that's important is people might, as you're talking about that, that might be a verse that comes up.
[time=1984] And so just know that that's there.
[time=1986] Definitely, yeah, because if you think about Jesus is eternal, there was never a time when Jesus wasn't.
[time=1992] He's always been, and he came to earth, he climbed down from heaven, took on humanity, and now we have Jesus.
[time=1999] That's so important. So whether he was born through a tree or Mary or however he has always been there,
[time=2006] so he wasn't created, he's always been.
[time=2008] He's the protatikos.
[time=2009] He's just like saying that.
[time=2011] I do like saying that.
[time=2012] That's good.
[time=2013] You've got Eucharist and protatikos.
[time=2015] I'm going to go watch gladiator after church.
[time=2018] Okay.
[time=2019] And then, okay, and Peter, or I'm sorry, Peter was talking to Jesus and Jesus is kind of hanging out with disciples.
[time=2026] And Jesus kind of wants to know, "Hey, what's the word on the street?
[time=2030] What are people saying about me?
[time=2032] What are they saying?" And Peter answered, "Some are saying you're John the Baptist.
[time=2036] Some saying Elijah, some think you're ancient prophet, risen from the dead." And Jesus said, "Well, Peter, what do you think?
[time=2042] What do you say?" And he says, "You are the Messiah sent from God." And it's pretty clear that there's something happening about this Jesus, this God man that Peter's saying there.
[time=2053] And then, one of my, one of my, almost my favorite, my next one is my favorite.
[time=2057] But Thomas, when, you know, there's kind of the aftermath of the crucifixion.
[time=2063] And there's just kind of this, almost this deflated group of people who are following this Jesus.
[time=2070] You know, they're following him around, and they're watching him do these miraculous things.
[time=2074] They're seeing him heal, and they're hearing him teach these things.
[time=2077] And then he's just dead, and he's gone.
[time=2081] And they're just like, "What is going on?" And then somebody says, "Hey, we saw him, we saw him." And Thomas was like, "Nah, I'm not going to believe it until I can touch the holes.
[time=2088] I'm not going to believe that." And so they're kind of all hanging out.
[time=2092] And Jesus, because of the doors were locked, it says that in the scriptures, the doors were locked.
[time=2096] Jesus showed up, and he says, "Don't be faithless.
[time=2099] They no longer believe." And Thomas says, "My Lord and my God." Now, that statement in itself is amazing, but Jesus' response, I think, is equally amazing.
[time=2110] Because Jesus says to him, "You believe because you have seen me.
[time=2113] Blessed are those who believe without seeing me." He doesn't rebuke Thomas.
[time=2118] Thomas clearly says, "My Lord and my God." Right?
[time=2124] And Jesus says, "Yeah, you believe.
[time=2126] You got it.
[time=2127] Others are going to believe too." And then at the crucifixion, on that day, when Jesus is up there and he's dying, there's a Roman officer there.
[time=2139] Watching this all unfold.
[time=2141] He's just doing his job.
[time=2142] Right?
[time=2143] He punched in the morning.
[time=2144] He's doing his job.
[time=2145] He's got his lunch packed.
[time=2146] You know, he was just going to work that day.
[time=2148] It happened to be this Jesus guy getting crucified.
[time=2151] And he's watching this unfold, and he's watching all the things that are happening.
[time=2156] And then this is what he says after watching Jesus die.
[time=2160] This man truly was the son of God.
[time=2164] This wasn't a father.
[time=2165] This wasn't a believer God.
[time=2166] This wasn't somebody intimate with Jesus.
[time=2168] This is just a guy, Roman officer, doing his job, putting this guy to death.
[time=2173] And he says, "Truly, this was the son of God." I mean, that's what some others have said.
[time=2178] Yeah.
[time=2179] What Jesus said, what others have said, and then just think for a moment about what God Himself said.
[time=2186] Matthew, chapter 3.
[time=2189] Verse 17, "At the beginning of Jesus and His earthly ministry," some of you in the room know the story.
[time=2196] He begins by being baptized.
[time=2200] And there He is in the river.
[time=2202] There He is being baptized by John.
[time=2205] And the Scripture says, as He comes up out of the water, remember?
[time=2209] It says that the heavens parted.
[time=2213] I mean, the sky opens up.
[time=2216] And in case there was any question, in case there was any worry, in case there would be any speculation,
[time=2222] the grace of God declares and pronounces from the heavens, this is my what?
[time=2230] Say it.
[time=2231] Son.
[time=2232] This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
[time=2237] And again, just some history for you, whenever you would hear, whenever they would hear, whenever in the Scriptures we come across the phrase the son of God.
[time=2246] Son of God there doesn't have much at all to do with birth.
[time=2250] Son of God has to do with deity.
[time=2251] It is a phrase that connects.
[time=2253] It is a phrase that would have connected.
[time=2255] It is a phrase that brings together Jesus and God and the Spirit of God.
[time=2260] Interesting there in Matthew 3 when the clouds open up and God says, "My son, what else shows up?"
[time=2266] The Spirit of God shows up in the form of a dove.
[time=2269] I mean, it was an incredible, if you think about it, kind of bringing back together of this trinity
[time=2275] that had been forever together in eternity past now there in that moment.
[time=2281] There they are.
[time=2282] It's actually pretty powerful.
[time=2283] But God says, "This is my son." Yeah, it really shows their fellowship.
[time=2288] Absolutely.
[time=2289] Co-equal, co-substantial.
[time=2290] Right there.
[time=2291] Father God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
[time=2294] So, that's how his whole ministry begins with God proclaiming for all to hear from the heavens that this is my son.
[time=2301] He is me in flesh is what that's saying.
[time=2306] And then I want to just read to you a couple things.
[time=2309] Go back if you've got your Bibles or you've got your iPad, whatever it is you're using this morning to look at the Scriptures.
[time=2315] Go back to Isaiah.
[time=2316] I don't know that this will be on the screen.
[time=2318] I'd love for all of you, though, if you've got a Bible, turn there.
[time=2321] And I want you just to see this.
[time=2322] I want you to mark it, circle it.
[time=2324] It's just a great sounds almost like Matthew 3.17.
[time=2329] It is very much the same spirit of Matthew 3.17 here.
[time=2333] Through the prophet Isaiah, God is talking about and declaring, again, talking about the person of Christ.
[time=2340] It says, "Behold my servant." Isaiah 42.1, "Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one, in whom my soul delights.
[time=2351] I, God, have put my spirit upon him." There's God the Father, there's God the Son, there's God the Holy Spirit all in one line.
[time=2358] "I, God, have put my spirit on him.
[time=2362] He will bring forth justice to the nations." That's exactly what Jesus did.
[time=2368] He will not cry out or raise his voice, nor make his voice heard in the street.
[time=2374] A bruised read, he will not break.
[time=2377] And a dimly burning wick, he will not extinguish.
[time=2380] He will, Christ will faithfully bring forth justice.
[time=2385] That was his mission to make right that which was wrong justice there.
[time=2392] Isaiah 42.1, talking about our Lord himself.
[time=2396] Look at Hebrews, go to the back of your New Testament if you would.
[time=2399] Go to the first chapter of Hebrews.
[time=2401] Let's just look at this briefly and see what God said.
[time=2405] What were God's words here recorded for us as it relates to this issue of who Jesus was?
[time=2412] It says in Hebrews chapter 1 verse 1, "God, after he spoke long ago to the fathers, in
[time=2419] the prophets, in many portions, and in many ways, in these last days, has spoken to us
[time=2425] in his Son, his Son, Jesus, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made
[time=2434] the world, and he, Christ, is the radiance of his glory and the exact representation of
[time=2444] his nature." I just want you to pause there just for a moment.
[time=2449] Many of you have had kids, many of you have seen kids born, many of us have had those situations
[time=2456] where we come across a little guy or a little gal and they look just what?
[time=2461] They look just like Josh said first hour, spitting image.
[time=2468] And we say that and we're talking about their face and we're talking about their eyes and we're talking about their mannerisms.
[time=2476] God says that Jesus was the exact representation of his what?
[time=2481] Say it, his nature, his whole being, God's being, who God is, God's character, God's
[time=2489] nature, God's being, Jesus, the exact, not sort of, not kind of, not maybe, the exact
[time=2496] representation of the very nature and character of God.
[time=2503] And he upholds all things by the word of his power when he had made purification of sins,
[time=2509] which is what he does now this week as he heads into Jerusalem and he moves toward Calvary.
[time=2514] And he had made purification of sins, he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on
[time=2520] high, having become as much better than the angels as he has inherited a more excellent
[time=2527] name than they, the name above all names, right?
[time=2531] Verse five, "For to which of the angels did God ever say you are my son?"
[time=2537] None.
[time=2539] "For to which of the angels did he ever say today I have begotten you?"
[time=2545] None.
[time=2546] "And again I will be a father to him," he said, "and he shall be a son to me."
[time=2552] And when he again brings the firstborn into the world, he says, "and let all the angels of God worship him." So God said he wasn't just a man.
[time=2564] Interesting there and also in the Colossians passage, it notes that Jesus was the Creator.
[time=2571] Correct.
[time=2572] As well.
[time=2573] That Hebrews one passage and the Colossians one references Jesus as a fact that he was there and an active part of creating the world, which only a fully God could do.
[time=2583] [AMEN] So God said he wasn't a man.
[time=2587] Others say he wasn't just a man, Jesus himself certainly claims and pronounces that he wasn't
[time=2595] just a man.
[time=2597] And our hope is that as you hear this, your understanding of this is clarified.
[time=2601] Our hope is that as you hear this, your commitment to these truths is even deepened.
[time=2606] And we want to close with this and we'll do this briefly, but we want to sing again.
[time=2612] We want to worship again this morning before we leave in light of these great truths.
[time=2617] But the last thing we want to say to you is this, we think it's really important that the church, you, me, these guys, we think it's hugely important that we get this one right.
[time=2629] This is something that we have to understand.
[time=2631] This is something that we've got to own.
[time=2633] This is something that we've got to go to great lengths if we need to to make sure that we understand this one.
[time=2639] Josh, Jesse, talk about why you think it's so important that we get this one right.
[time=2644] Yeah, I was reading some Timothy Keller's book called "The Reason for God."
[time=2650] And this quote jumped out at me, I think it's called "The Great Reversal." It says this, "The essence of sin is we as humans continually substitute ourselves for
[time=2660] God.
[time=2661] All the essence of salvation is God substituting himself for us.
[time=2666] We put ourselves where only God deserves to be, and God puts himself where we deserve
[time=2672] to be." And I like that because we have a Savior who substituted himself for us.
[time=2678] In other words, he came down out of heaven and he went through all of the trials and
[time=2684] all of the pains and everything that life could throw at him, temptation and struggles
[time=2690] and death.
[time=2691] And he took all those on.
[time=2694] So when we get to a point in our life like when we're saying, "God, you just don't understand I'm going through, he's been there, done that." He knows everything, he's been through it all.
[time=2704] He can walk right beside you through all of those things.
[time=2708] He is God and he is man, and he's got both perspectives equally and perfect.
[time=2714] And so we have a Savior who's substituted himself for us and walks with us.
[time=2721] That's with them in the incarnation of God came down and walked with us, and he'll hold hands with us, he'll walk us through those valleys, he'll laugh and he'll cry with us, he'll bleed, he bled for us.
[time=2733] So that's why I think it's so important that we understand that he was fully man and fully God because he can relate with us wherever we're at, whatever we're going through.
[time=2742] Hebrews 4, 15 says, "For we do not have a Savior, a high priest who cannot sympathize
[time=2749] with our weakness, but because he was who he said he was, we have one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin, therefore in light of that truth, let us draw near with
[time=2761] confidence to the throne of grace." It's good input, Jesse.
[time=2766] So Jesus is the center of Christianity.
[time=2771] So if Jesus isn't who he said he was, then Christianity fails to be what it claims to
[time=2777] be.
[time=2779] And it can only then be like any other religion which might be some good advice, it might be some moral teaching, it might be some ways to get along better with one another, but at the end of the day there's no purification for sins, there's no redemption because Christ
[time=2794] is the key to that, Christ is the center.
[time=2797] So if Jesus were not fully God and was only a man, then he would then needed to have died
[time=2804] for his own sins, right?
[time=2808] And we would still be stuck in ours.
[time=2811] Hebrews 7 says it this way, starting verse 26, it says, "For it was indeed fitting that
[time=2817] we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners."
[time=2823] That's talking about his deity, "Exalted above the heavens, he has no need like those
[time=2829] high priests to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins, and then for those of the
[time=2835] people.
[time=2836] He doesn't have need to offer for his own sins, since he did this once for all when he offered up himself." And so that idea that we'd still be stuck in our own sins, and then just secondly the importance of the idea, and I think Kelly might touch on this a little bit more, but if Jesus was just a man, the entire storyline of the Bible is just false because it starts with Jesus and it ends with Jesus.
[time=2859] In Genesis chapter 3 there's this hope of what will come out of the decision to let sin
[time=2865] enter the world with Adam and Eve of this coming one who would actually crush the head of Satan.
[time=2870] And so there's this beginning understanding of a Savior that's coming.
[time=2875] In Genesis 12 and the Abrahamic covenant there's this idea of one that would come through the line of Abraham that would be a blessing to all the nations.
[time=2883] And then in 2 Samuel 7 the Davidic covenant that would say, "There's going to be the same one who's coming.
[time=2888] We get more and more evidence of who he is, more and more clues about what this person's going to be like.
[time=2894] He's going to be one who would rule on the throne forever.
[time=2897] His kingdom will not have an end." And then we come to the Old, to the New Testament and Jesus is the fulfillment of that.
[time=2904] Even when he's talking to two people on the road to Emmaus after he had been crucified
[time=2910] and raised from the dead, he had talked to them about how all of the Old Testament pointed
[time=2916] to him.
[time=2917] And then even into eternity we'll be singing the praises of the Lamb who was slain.
[time=2922] And so it's the whole storyline of the Bible and the whole storyline of creation, a redemption of creation.
[time=2928] Why is it so important, my friends, that we would get this one right?
[time=2934] Why is it so important that you would understand this?
[time=2936] It's so important, please listen, because if Jesus was just a man, if he was just a human
[time=2943] being like me and you, then he's dead, then he's dead.
[time=2953] And if Jesus died and stayed dead, if he was human and not divine, then there was no resurrection.
[time=2962] And if there's no resurrection, our faith is an absolute sham.
[time=2967] And worst of all, worst of all, there's no good news.
[time=2972] Look at 1 Corinthians 15, just real quick, would you turn there in your Bibles?
[time=2976] Would you look at 1 Corinthians 15?
[time=2978] You've never read it before, it is an entire chapter on the centrality of the resurrection.
[time=2985] Look at 1 Corinthians 15, 12, now if Christ has preached that he has been raised from
[time=2991] the dead, how do some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead?
[time=2995] Or how is it there are some who are saying he's just a man?
[time=2998] Same thing.
[time=3000] Verse 13, but if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has been raised.
[time=3006] And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain.
[time=3011] And see it right there, your faith also is vain.
[time=3015] I came across this this week, listen, there is no good news if Jesus is just a man.
[time=3021] The news is in fact bad, very bad, because Revelation chapter 1 says, "I am the living
[time=3027] one who was dead and am alive forevermore." In Romans 14, 9 it says, "He died and rose that he might be the Lord of the living and
[time=3039] the dead." You see, if Jesus was just a man, if he didn't rise, then he's not Lord.
[time=3046] He didn't provide a sufficient sacrifice for sin.
[time=3050] All gospel preaching is a joke.
[time=3053] We are the worst of charlatans and fakes.
[time=3059] We're no different than all the rest of the false teachers, of the false religions in the world.
[time=3065] If he didn't conquer death, then he didn't conquer sin.
[time=3070] And if he didn't conquer sin, he didn't conquer hell.
[time=3074] And the angels who said, "Behold, I bring you good news of great joy which shall be to all the people they lied." It was all a farce.
[time=3085] If Jesus is just a man, there is no good news.
[time=3088] The news is all bad.
[time=3090] It's very, very bad.
[time=3093] Another good man failed.
[time=3098] If Jesus is just a man, we're all going to hell.
[time=3102] And believe me, if he's just a man, death has unspeakable sting.
[time=3113] So we think it's pretty important we get this one right.
[time=3119] First Corinthians 15, verses 17 and 19 is the band makes their way back up.
[time=3123] Would you just look at this with me?
[time=3125] Oh, how important it is that we get this right.
[time=3129] And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless, you're still in your sins.
[time=3135] Then those also who have fallen asleep, your mom who died, your dad who died, your uncle
[time=3141] who died, your spiritual mentor who died.
[time=3143] They're all in hell, perishing.
[time=3148] If he's just a man, that's what he's saying, then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
[time=3155] If we have hoped in Christ, and he was just a man in this life only, we are of all men
[time=3162] most to be pitied.
[time=3170] And so Josh and Jesse and I, we sit here this morning, we stand here with you, and we proclaim
[time=3177] to you the good news, and we believe that the news is good, that it's not bad.
[time=3183] We believe that Christ is exactly who he said he was.
[time=3187] He said it, others said it, God said it, and we believe the Word of God supports it.
[time=3192] We believe history supports it.
[time=3195] And so you can sing, and so we can have hope, and so we can stand with great humility and
[time=3203] confidence in the person and saving work of the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
[time=3209] He is a good God, and he will forever reign.
[time=3211] Would you stand?
[time=3212] Please don't leave, please stand and raise your voice, please stand and sing greatly.
[time=3218] Please stand with Adam and the band as they lead us, and will you fill this room up with
[time=3224] worship and praise over the great truth that we've seen and discovered this morning.
[time=3254] You are good, you are good when there's nothing good in me, you are love, you are love on
[time=3263] display for all to see, you are light, you are light when the darkness closes in, you
[time=3272] are hope, you are hope, you have covered all my sin.
[time=3284] You are peace, you are peace when my fear is crippling.
[time=3289] You are true, you are true even in my wandering.
[time=3296] You are joy, you are joy, you're the reason that I sing.
[time=3301] You are life, you are life, and your death is lost at sea.
[time=3311] And all I'm running to your arms, I'm running to your arms, the riches of your love will
[time=3324] always be enough, nothing compares to your embrace, light of the world we've ever made.
[time=3338] And you are more, you are more than my words will ever say, "You are Lord, You are Lord,
[time=3351] all creation will proclaim, You are here, You are here, in Your presence I may hold,
[time=3359] You are God, You are God, oh, that's a letting go."
[time=3371] And all I'm running to your arms, I'm running to your arms, the riches of your love will
[time=3382] always be enough, nothing compares to your embrace, light of the world we've ever made.
[time=3396] I'm running to your arms, I'm running to your arms, the riches of your love will always be
[time=3406] enough, nothing compares to your embrace, light of the world we've ever made.
[time=3425] My arm will sing, no other name, Jesus, Jesus, My arm will sing, no other name, Jesus,
[time=3468] Jesus, I'm running to your arms, I'm running to your arms, the riches of your love will
[time=3485] always be enough, nothing compares to your embrace, light of the world we've ever made.
[time=3499] I'm running to your arms, I'm running to your arms, the riches of your love will always
[time=3509] be enough, nothing compares to your embrace, light of the world we've ever made.
