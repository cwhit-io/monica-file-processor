[time=89] [MUSIC]
[time=95] I see beneath the waters that Christ has prepared.
[time=100] [MUSIC]
[time=103] Seeing together I will rise.

[time=344] [MUSIC]
[time=348] Well good morning and welcome to the broadcast again.
[time=351] This is a Sunday morning like no other Sunday morning.
[time=354] What we call the great Sunday morning resurrection Sunday and we are so thankful that you can be with us, so thankful that you have tuned in.
[time=362] We are looking forward to celebrating the resurrection of our Lord.
[time=366] We had an amazing good Friday service where we reflected on His sacrifice and what really made Friday so great in terms of eternity and its impact, the impact of that Friday on those of us that know the Lord.
[time=382] Now Sunday has come and we get the honor and the privilege and the joy of celebrating the life of our Lord Jesus and the life that He makes available to each and every one of us that follow Him.
[time=394] It is a great, great day indeed He has risen.
[time=398] As you watch this and as I hope your heart is encouraged, I want to invite you to think about joining us in the weeks to come.
[time=405] You see following Resurrection Sunday at the beginning of May, we will begin a new teaching series on Sunday morning.
[time=413] You'll see a picture for that series on the screen now. It's called the land between.
[time=419] I want you to think about that phrase just for a moment with me, the land between.
[time=424] You see the land between is a place my friends of transition. It's a place where life is sort of unknown.
[time=432] It's a time in your life and a time in mind where due to job status or physical health or family crisis or relational undoing, I mean there could be a number of things going on but like the people of Israel in the Old Testament.
[time=450] You sort of find yourself wandering. You're not where you were, right? Egypt. They were in Egypt and then God let them go.
[time=462] And now He's taking them to a land that was called the Promised Land.
[time=467] But in between Egypt and the Promised Land was this time of wandering, this time of confusion, this time of questioning God, this time of trying to figure out who they were going to be and where they were going to be.
[time=479] And where they were going to go and I'm telling you there's some things there for us to learn and see as we travel our own road through the land between.
[time=488] So come and join us in May. It's going to be a great, great study, one that I think could change and alter your life and your view of God's plan for you.
[time=498] Please like that, so I hope that we thank you so much for being a part of this family. Thank you for the encouragement that so many of you give to us and the response that you do back.
[time=510] That has always been a blessing.
[time=524] Thank you for being a part of this family.
[time=529] It's going to be a blessing.
[time=542] You see the root of the end.
[time=546] You see the root of the end. The Lord I got.
[time=553] And the Lord I got is never faithful, never changing through the ages.
[time=567] From this darkness we may lead us and never eat the same.
[time=577] You're the Lord I got.
[time=583] In the silence in the waiting, still we can know you are good.
[time=598] All your plans are for your glory.
[time=604] Yes we can know you are good.
[time=617] And the Lord I got is never faithful, never changing through the ages.
[time=629] From this darkness we may lead us and never eat the same.
[time=639] The Lord I got.
[time=654] We won't move without you.
[time=665] You're the light of all and all that we need.
[time=671] We won't move without you.
[time=678] You're the light of all and all that we need.
[time=683] We won't move without you.
[time=697] You're the light of all and all that we need.
[time=702] Ever thankful, ever changing through the ages.
[time=711] From this darkness you may lead us and never eat the same.
[time=721] You're the Lord I got.
[time=724] You're the light of all and all that we need.
[time=749] Thankful for God's sweetfulness.
[time=756] Well, hey, we come this morning to not only Resurrection Sunday morning, but it is also and it's how we planned it.
[time=762] It is the end of a five-week series that we've entitled Myth Busters.
[time=767] And what we've been doing is we've been looking at these culturally accepted, in many ways, statements.
[time=773] We've been looking at these ideas that a lot of folks, might just consider true because it's just kind of what's been said.
[time=783] It's kind of what's been put out there.
[time=786] And we thought, you know what?
[time=787] We'll just take a few weeks and we'll look at some of these statements like you deserve to be happy, like life's what you make it, like a good God would never allow suffering.
[time=800] We've looked at these statements and we've tried to kind of take this myth, if you will, and allow the truth of God's Word to meet these statements and give us kind of a biblically informed look into the reality of that.
[time=815] Is that really true?
[time=817] And today, and it was planned this way from the beginning, we come to our fifth and last myth that is widely accepted in this world of ours.
[time=827] In your world and mine, I bump into people every single day who believe this, that death is the end.
[time=836] That death is the end.
[time=839] Many of us have for years heard this line of reasoning.
[time=845] Carl Sagan said, I would love to believe that when I die, I will live again.
[time=850] That some thinking, feeling, remembering part of me will continue.
[time=853] But as much as I want to believe that and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife, I know of nothing, he says, to suggest.
[time=863] Nothing that it is more than wishful thinking.
[time=868] Albert Einstein said, I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation whose purposes are modeled after our own.
[time=877] A God Einstein said, a God in short who is but a mere reflection of human frailty.
[time=883] Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms.
[time=898] And then there's my favorite Isaac Asimov.
[time=901] He said, I don't believe in an afterlife, so I don't have to spend my whole life fearing hell or fearing heaven even more.
[time=910] For whatever the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven would be even worse.
[time=916] The boredom of heaven, something Isaac Asimov would fear more than the tortures of hell.
[time=927] Interesting.
[time=928] Well, at the end of the day, here is what I want you to know.
[time=933] Here is what we choose to proclaim this morning above all other mornings
[time=939] and with all due respect to Mr. Sagan and Mr. Einstein and Mr. Asimov, with all due respect to their impressive human minds and their vast human knowledge,
[time=952] I choose today my friends to believe the words of God himself expressed through the pen
[time=959] of the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 18, where it says this, oh please don't miss this, for the word of the cross,
[time=971] which is what we're celebrating this weekend.
[time=973] For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God.
[time=983] For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, amen?
[time=988] And the cleverness of the clever I will set aside.
[time=992] Where is the wise man God asks?
[time=995] Where is the scribe?
[time=997] Where is the debater of this age?
[time=1000] Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
[time=1007] For since the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom,
[time=1013] you see that verse 21, for since in the wisdom of God, just how he planned it, the world through its wisdom, all that they know
[time=1025] and all that they've figured out and all that they have surmised.
[time=1031] In the wisdom of the world, through the wisdom of the world, it did not come to know God.
[time=1037] God was well pleased through the foolishness of the message, the simplicity of the message preached to save those who believe.
[time=1048] For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom, for we preach Christ crucified.
[time=1056] To Jews' stumbling block and to Gentiles' foolishness, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ,
[time=1066] the power of God and the wisdom of God.
[time=1070] Look at verse 25, because the foolishness of God, the simplicity of God,
[time=1076] the ease of the gospel, my friends, is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
[time=1085] I am putting my faith this morning, and I'm inviting you to place yours in a crucified resurrected Lord, not Carl Sagan.
[time=1097] I'm inviting you this morning to join me in placing my faith and my trust
[time=1103] in a crucified and resurrected Lord.
[time=1106] In the power of his message, not the smarts of Albert Einstein,
[time=1112] I'm inviting you to place your faith in the joy and in the hope
[time=1118] of a glorious future, not some boring divine hell that Isaac Asimov dreamed up.
[time=1129] No, we are here to proclaim the great message of the resurrection.
[time=1135] And that great message this morning is that death is not the end.
[time=1140] That death is in reality only the what?
[time=1143] Say it.
[time=1144] Only the beginning. Death is not the end. Death is the beginning.
[time=1148] I believe that each and every one of you and those who are dear to you.
[time=1152] Right now, look at those who are around you. Many of you are sitting near those who are dear to you. Go ahead and look at them. Look in their eyes.
[time=1159] I believe that each and every one of you and those who are sitting near you this morning, those babies that you hold, those kids that sit next to you, those family members that you cherish, we believe this morning, that each and every one of them and you as well have been offered by God never-ending life. Eternal joy, absolute healing, pure endless activity in a new heaven, on a new earth, activity that contrary to Mr. Asimov's ideas, I don't believe will be endlessly boring at all. I remember my kids, like many of your kids growing up, my kids, all five of them at one point or another became just utterly interested in this idea of heaven and they wanted to know what it would be like.
[time=1204] You've had the conversations. We had them for years, Dad. What will it be like?
[time=1208] What will we do at one point? One of them, I forget which one actually said to me the words, are we going to just, are we going to just like sit on clouds and play harps and go to church all the time?
[time=1220] To which I'm sure to some sounds like actually hell, but no, I said we're not going to do that.
[time=1228] I mean, I think you probably could sit on a cloud or play a harp and I do believe that we will go to worship amen, but there's a whole lot more to it and so let's take a look at that this morning. Can we do that? Let's take a look at this together over the next few minutes. Let me see if I can't just with God's help paint a biblical picture for you of what it is that on this great morning of all mornings we can actually look forward to.
[time=1256] Death is not the end, it's the beginning. Death can be death actually.
[time=1260] Depends on you. Depends on the choice you make.
[time=1264] Depends on your readiness or your willingness to embrace it.
[time=1268] But the truth, my friends, this morning that's being proclaimed to you as best we can is that death actually could be for you the beginning of some things.
[time=1280] Three things I want you to see this morning. I hope you'll just take note of these things. Death can be the beginning of perfect eternal relationship with man. Death can be the beginning of perfect eternal relationship with God and it can be the beginning of perfect eternal relationship with creation. Perfect eternal relationship with man, with God and with creation. Hey, let's jump into that first one and take a look at that just for a few minutes. Can we go back in your Bibles or your iPads or your phones, however it is you're looking at the scriptures this morning.
[time=1312] Look at 1 Thessalonians 4. 1 Thessalonians 4 we're going to pick it up in 14 and this is not some epic tale my friends. This sounds like kind of the screenplay of a big high budget Hollywood film but I'm telling you this is really going to happen. This is how this will all unfold. It says in 1 Thessalonians 4 14, "For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again," is that you? "For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus. For this we say to you by the word of the Lord that we who are alive and remain until the coming, the second coming of the Lord will not precede those who have fallen asleep for the Lord himself." Watch this. For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God and the dead in Christ those who have gone before will rise first.
[time=1384] Hallelujah. Then we who are alive and remain those of us who might be here when this is all happening will be caught up together with them, those who died before, in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so we shall always be with the Lord.
[time=1404] Therefore, verse 18, "Comfort each other with these words." Now I share that with you on Resurrection Sunday morning simply as a reminder that every single person in the past who has ever fully trusted in the person in work of Christ will one day be reunited in bodily form, heavenly bodies with Christ and those who are alive when Christ returns and he really is going to return. And we will go together to a new heaven, a new Jerusalem that will be located on a new earth and we will be together for all of eternity.
[time=1452] People ask me all the time. They ask me questions about eternity. People always are asking about heaven and its realities and people will oftentimes ask me. So like really what's it going to be like with each other? People will want to know. They'll say, "Are we going to know each other?" And I say, "Absolutely." Oh, absolutely we're going to know each other.
[time=1480] Yes, we'll know each other perfectly and meaningfully.
[time=1484] It is, I believe, going to be this perfect community, all of us, this perfect community of God's people. It will be like family. Now the Bible says that we won't get into all this in great detail. The Bible says that we won't be given in marriage in heaven. I believe that means there's not going to be babies and all that stuff.
[time=1508] It doesn't mean though that you're not going to know your wife of 62 years when you're with her up on a golden street somewhere. I mean we're going to know each other. There will be familiarity. We will have relationship.
[time=1520] This obviously is something that's meant a great deal to God and we believe God is going to further and deepen those relationships. We will be together, you, me and the Apostle Paul.
[time=1536] You, me, and King David, really.
[time=1544] You, me, and Mary.
[time=1548] You, me, and all the martyrs who have ever lived and died. You and me and the hundreds of thousands of Chinese Christians who were tortured and beaten and died under the dark days of communism's persecution.
[time=1568] You, me, and Joshua.
[time=1572] You and me and Moses. You and me and the great reformer, Martin Luther, think about it from the first century church fathers who birth our faith with courage and boldness all the way to those who died in Rome under the cruel sort of Nero will be together and they will know you and you will know them and those and those who have already gone. Your mom, your dad, your son, your daughter, your sister, your brother, your husband, your wife, we will all again one day be together.
[time=1628] With those, listen, who placed their faith in and followed Christ together.
[time=1640] No gossip. No heartache.
[time=1644] No mistreatment. No impatience. No arguing.
[time=1648] No abuse. No strife. No disappointment.
[time=1652] No lying. No anger. No hurt.
[time=1656] No borrowing clothes without asking. That's for my daughters.
[time=1660] Good night.
[time=1664] It's like World War III when that happens. I just don't get it.
[time=1668] Did you borrow my blouse? Yes, but just answer the question. Oh my goodness. Relational strife.
[time=1676] They'll never again be a woman driving in a car by herself thinking to herself, why did she ask her to the mall and not me?
[time=1684] None of that. Oh and there will be malls in heaven, don't you? Oh yeah, there will be.
[time=1688] There will be huge seven story malls.
[time=1692] 500 million square feet and all it will be is five guys and it'll all be five guys in sporting goods stores.
[time=1700] It's all it'll be.
[time=1704] Guys will be going to the mall in droves.
[time=1708] We'll fly, we'll run, we'll skip, whatever we want to do.
[time=1712] Honey, I'm going to the mall.
[time=1716] Perfect. Perfect.
[time=1720] Un hindered.
[time=1724] Relational harmony.
[time=1728] You will be supported. You will be loved.
[time=1732] You will be listened to. You will be encouraged. You will be served, ministered to, inspired, cared for, blessed. Always.
[time=1744] Always. Never ending.
[time=1748] You say, I can't even conceive of it.
[time=1752] And you're right, we can't. We can't even conceive of this because of the presence of a thing called sin.
[time=1760] And the reason it will be like this is because there will be no more what, say it.
[time=1768] Sin. Because Jesus destroyed sin when he defeated death and now death isn't the end. It's just the what?
[time=1776] The beginning. The beginning of eternal life.
[time=1780] Perfect, ongoing, eternal life together in perfect unity.
[time=1784] You know what you get on this one? And you're going to get this on the second one and the third one. I'll explain it when I get there. But here's what you're going to get on these three things with each other, with God and with creation.
[time=1796] Every once in a while I believe God gives you a glimpse.
[time=1800] We're not going to get to see all this now, are we?
[time=1804] But I just told you what's going to happen with each other one day. But listen, every once in a while in this fallen, screwed up, dark, hurting world of ours that every one of us lives in and we're trying to endure, we get a glimpse.
[time=1820] And I want to invite you this morning to maybe begin to appreciate those glimpses. Just a little bit more.
[time=1828] My family isn't any different than your family.
[time=1832] We've been through heartache and trial and difficulty just like you have.
[time=1836] Sometimes it's huge, large issues. Sometimes you guys, it's just the challenges of everyday life with a mom and dad that aren't perfect.
[time=1844] A husband and wife that struggle at times and kids that are less than what you'd want them to be on any given day. But that's how it is.
[time=1852] So yeah, we struggle like you do. We're at dinner the other night, Friday night.
[time=1856] After a good Friday service. And it was just, you know, it wasn't anything enormously special. It was just we were at dinner and it was really busy at this place. And they ended up putting us in a kind of a room off to the side, which we didn't plan.
[time=1872] So all of a sudden the six of us, one of us was still gone. He's up at school.
[time=1876] But the six of us sat at this table for an hour and a half.
[time=1880] And for some reason, there just wasn't any arguing. And for some reason, everything just went alright. And our oldest daughter, our oldest daughter told us that night about her decision on where she's going to go to college. And there was such genuine joy in her sisters and little brothers heart. And we talked and laughed. And it was just a little glimpse. You're with me every once in a while.
[time=1908] You just get a glimpse. And you think, man, relationship when it's right is really, really sweet.
[time=1916] And then you get in the car and start arguing and you're driving home. And it's like the glimpse is done.
[time=1924] But you're grateful for the glimpse.
[time=1928] Death can actually be the beginning of perfect eternal relationship with God as well. My friend's death can actually be the beginning of perfect and eternal relationship with God. Can I just read this to you? Please listen.
[time=1944] I love the words of Randy Alcorn in his book on heaven.
[time=1948] And he says this about our eternal relationship with him. Listen, don't miss this. Oh God, he quotes from Psalm 63. Oh God, you are my God.
[time=1960] Earnestly I seek you, my soul thirsts for you, my body longs for you in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
[time=1968] There the psalmist echoes the great desire of the human heart that God is in fact our great desire. We may imagine we want a thousand different things, but God is the one we really long for. His presence brings satisfaction.
[time=1988] His absence brings thirst and longing. Our longing for heaven is a longing for God. A longing that involves not only our inner beings, but our bodies as well. Being with God is the heart and soul of heaven.
[time=2004] Every other heavenly pleasure and there will be many will derive from and be secondary to the great joy of being in his personal presence.
[time=2016] God's greatest gift to us is and always will be himself. When speaking of God's people on the new earth, it says in Revelation 22-4, it's an amazing statement.
[time=2032] It says in Revelation 22-4, and this is at the end, it says they will see his what? Say it, Church.
[time=2040] Say it louder. It says in the Bible that at the end of this deal when it all is said and done that there will be a day and there will be a time when the people of God will see God's face.
[time=2052] Wow. John, John says, you can see this on the screen as well. John done in a quote I love.
[time=2060] It says, "I shall rise from the dead. I shall see the son of God, the son of glory, and shine myself as that sun shines.
[time=2068] I shall be united to the ancient of days to God himself who had no mourning, never began, no man ever watched this, saw God and lived. And yet I shall not live till I see God. And when I have seen him I shall never die." I love that.
[time=2088] Oh, my friends, to be told that we'll see God's face is so shocking to anyone who ever understood God's transcendence and God's inapproachability.
[time=2104] You say, what are you talking about? Well, think about this. In ancient Israel, only the high priest could go into the holy of holies. Remember that? We've taught you that in the past. Only the high priest could go into the holy of holies.
[time=2116] It was the holy of holies where they thought the presence of God actually dwelt.
[time=2120] And once a year he could only go in once a year. And when he would go in they'd tie a rope around his what? Around his ankle. Because they thought if he died nobody would have the guts or the nerve to go in there and get him so they'd just pull him out with the rope.
[time=2136] God struck down Uza in 2 Samuel 6 for just touching the arc of the covenant.
[time=2140] Moses said to God, Exodus 33, show me your glory, God. Moses said, God responded, I'll cause all my goodness to pass in front of you. Buddy said, you cannot see my face.
[time=2152] No one may see my face and live, but we're going to see, we're going to see his face. How does this work?
[time=2160] When my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed. Then I will remove my hand and you will see my backside.
[time=2168] But my face must not be seen.
[time=2172] The New Testament says that God lives in 1 Timothy 6, unapproachable light who no one has seen or can see.
[time=2184] That's why when we're told in Revelation 22 4 that we'll see God's face it should astound us.
[time=2196] For this to happen, and here you go. Here's the whole point of all this.
[time=2200] For this to happen.
[time=2204] For us to be able to see the face of God and not die. For us to be able to see the face of God and live. For us to be able to see the face of God and rejoice would require that something radical would need to have happened between then and now.
[time=2224] And my friends, this morning we come to celebrate something radical. Amen? Today we come to celebrate the very thing that makes that possible. For you see the obstacle to seeing God's face has always been sin. Hebrews 12-14 says without holiness no one will see the Lord. It's only because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that will be completely sinless that will be able to see God and live.
[time=2252] And not only will we see his face and live.
[time=2256] Oh please hear this, but we will likely wonder if we've ever lived before once we've seen his face.
[time=2268] C.S. Lewis said years ago I've held on to this, I've always remembered this quote. C.S. Lewis said it would seem it would seem that our Lord finds our desires not too strong but too weak. We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us. Like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are too.
[time=2304] We are far too easily pleased.
[time=2308] I know how I hope this is changing for you and for me. Oh how I hope that our glimpse of God and his goodness and his love for us and this relationship that he longs to have with you. I hope that you are beginning to see the great joy of the sea.
[time=2328] Oh I hope there's a willingness in you to move beyond the puddles that you play in and to give yourself to the great and vast love and graces and goodness of God.
[time=2344] Seeing God I imagine it will be like the novel edge of eternity when the main character Nick C. Grave at last sees Jesus Christ he said the king stepped out from the city just outside the gate and put his hand on my shoulder. I was aware of no one and nothing but him. I saw before me an aged weathered king thoughtful guardian of an empire but I also saw a white virile warrior prince prime for battle eager to mount his steed and march in conquest. His eyes were keen as sharpened swords yet deep as wells full of the memories of the old and the dreams both of the young. This is the wonder of our redemption to be welcomed into the very presence of our Lord and to see him face to face.
[time=2396] What will you see?
[time=2400] What will we see in his eyes?
[time=2404] Though we cannot experience all of this in fullness yet I invite you to capture a glimpse. Every once in a while he does in fact give us a glimpse. What do I mean?
[time=2420] In Hebrews 10 it says we have confidence today to enter the most holy place by the blood of Jesus let us Hebrews 4 let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace we shouldn't read these verses casually for they tell us something wonderful beyond comprehension that the blood of Jesus has brought us full access to God's throne room and his most holy place even now he welcomes us to come there in prayer in eternity when we're resurrected beings he will not only permit us to enter his presence in prayer but he will welcome us to live in his presence to be with him in his presence to hang out with him in his presence to linger in his presence oh please tell me you'd rather not splash around in puddles and then lastly because of what happened this morning we're given friends the opportunity to embrace the beginning of death that which death begins one of those things is perfect one day perfect an eternal relationship with creation and I want you to think about this with me you get a pastor talking about creation and the earth and people all of a sudden start thinking maybe you know it's going to be some kind of a green message please please listen I like the idea of green if by green you mean this I like green if by green you mean this watch this if we're talking about man you and I would have no argument that mankind is fallen sin wrecked it and it's all messed up and all broken and all cracked and so we're all about now in our church in our ministry we're all about trying to redeem man we're trying to bring man back we're not trying to trash man we're not trying to discard man are we no we're trying to do what God's doing God's about redeeming that which is lost and broken well not only is man lost and broken but guess what so is his creation his creation his wonderful creation that he made took a hit and it's all busted it's all ruined it's all cracked and marred and so when I grew up in the church and this is not a slam on my dad who taught me most of what I know or other pastors or teachers who I just growing up in the 70s and 80s I kind of learned when it came to the earth when it came to the planet I always kind of thought growing up from what I heard from these guys that at the end of the day it didn't really matter because it was gonna what burn and I want to just remind all of you that while the Bible is very clear that there will be a some form of destruction that comes oh make no mistake it's not going away and this earth that he made this creation that he formed just like man will be redeemed and it will be made new and so I want to do whatever I can do whatever I'm able to do to join him and the restoring of that I'm good with that I'm great with that and there will be a day when we will live in perfect eternal relationship with creation a constant daily fully engaged experience again hard to comprehend but just give me a couple minutes think about this a daily fully engaged experience with a creation in its Eden garden of Eden and it's Eden like form and it's restored and renewed and reconciled in revived condition no erosion no pollution no deterioration no natural disasters just natural amazements no hurricanes just a light sprinkle whenever it would be needed no tornadoes just a gentle breeze whenever that would be right no earthquakes perfect weather for perfect occasions and believe me all occasions will be perfect perfect creation the land see the skies vegetation the stars the animals animals always comes up kids want to know there could be animals listen I believe he's going to renew it to what it once was and what it once was had animals Adam named them so clearly there were no cats and Genesis so we're good there but I've seen some paintings of ancient dogs so I think we're good there but I believe it's going to all be redeemed I believe it's all going to be transformed I think the lion and the lamb thing I think it's really true I think it will be an amazing unbelievable incomprehensible for us today experience and oh I hope now you will be a part of it death is not the end as Adam and Janice and the team come up death is not the end and really what the word of God is offering you on this resurrection morning and all that we've looked at my friends is hope oh please write that word down please fix that word in your heart and mind right now hope the resurrection of Jesus Christ delivers eternal hope it represents daily hope it produces unending hope without the empty tomb death winds darkness prevails Satan conquers Jesus was a nutcase the church is a sham and I'm a fool forgiving my life to this but he didn't stay dead he lives he lives and it says in 1 Corinthians 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 54 is where we'll pick it up it says in 1 Corinthians 1554 I love these words and the mortal will have put on immortality then will come about the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory oh death where is your victory oh death where is your sting where the pain of death go the sting of death listen the sting of death is sinned and the power of sin is the law but thanks be to God everybody just read this with me out loud but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ one more time but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ would you just sit there please don't leave and allow the words of this great anthem that Janice will sing and the band and the choir is going to join her allow the great truth of this great song to fill your hearts
