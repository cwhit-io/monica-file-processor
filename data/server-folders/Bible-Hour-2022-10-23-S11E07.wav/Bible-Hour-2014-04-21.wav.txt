[time=0] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=46] >> That's crazy.
[time=47] [MUSIC]
[time=54] There's a chorus in there that talks about him being our being our matchless king.
[time=62] Let's sing that again together.
[time=65] >> You alone are the matchless king, do you love me all majesty, your glories and wonders what's on camera side.
[time=80] You breathe in the air, shine in the light alone.
[time=89] And you alone are the matchless king, do you love me all majesty, your glories and wonders what's on camera side.
[time=104] You breathe in the air, shine in the light, shine in the light, shine in the light.
[time=123] You're the light of the world.
[time=128] You step down into darkness, open my eyes, let me see.
[time=140] Beauty that made this heart adore you,
[time=147] hope of a life spent with you.
[time=155] >> So here I am.
[time=156] >> Here I am to worship.
[time=160] Here I am to bow down.
[time=163] Here I am to say that you're my God.
[time=169] You're all together loving, all together worthy, all together wonderful to me.
[time=183] King of all days.
[time=188] King of all days, oh so highly exalted, Lord I sing heaven alone.
[time=201] Come you came to leave earth, you created all for a saint.
[time=211] He came home.
[time=215] Here I am.
[time=217] Here I am to worship.
[time=220] Here I am to bow down.
[time=223] Here I am to say that you're my God.
[time=229] You're all together loving, all together worthy, all together wonderful to me.
[time=241] Here I am to worship.
[time=246] Here I am to bow down.
[time=249] Here I am to say that you're my God.
[time=255] You're all together loving, all together worthy, all together wonderful to me.
[time=272] And I never know how much it cost
[time=279] to see my sin upon that cross.
[time=286] How never know how much it cost
[time=293] to see my sin upon that cross.
[time=299] How never know how much it cost
[time=306] to see my sin upon that.
[time=312] I never know how much it cost
[time=319] to see my sin upon that cross.
[time=326] Here I am.
[time=328] Here I am to worship.
[time=331] Here I am to bow down.
[time=335] Here I am to say that you're my God.
[time=341] You're all together loving, all together worthy, all together wonderful to me.
[time=354] Here I am, here I am to worship.
[time=359] Here I am to bow down.
[time=362] Here I am to say that you're my God.
[time=368] You're all together loving, all together worthy, all together wonderful to me.
[time=383] Here I am to say that you're my God.
[time=1095] Worthy of praise.
[time=1097] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[time=1100] We just sang that to receive glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and all of that.
[time=1108] Psalm 134 is really little.
[time=1110] It's after Psalm 133 and before 1 Psalm 135.
[time=1114] If you're looking for it, that's where you find it nestled between those two.
[time=1117] It's three verses, Psalm 134.
[time=1119] It's a song.
[time=1120] It says in your Bibles.
[time=1121] You see that?
[time=1122] It says a song of ascents.
[time=1124] It's a song that they would sing as they were going up to Jerusalem to offer sacrifice.
[time=1129] They would sing songs of remembrance, songs of praise, songs to orient them rightly about
[time=1137] what they were facing.
[time=1138] I just thought about this and I wanted to share it with you as you begin this morning.
[time=1142] I'm going to kind of hover over us as we are together today.
[time=1148] Bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord who stand by night in the house of the Lord,
[time=1156] lift up your hands to the holy place and bless the Lord.
[time=1161] May the Lord bless you from Zion, he who made heaven and earth.
[time=1168] Let's pray as we begin this morning and as we pray, I'll just say this to you.
[time=1173] We'll be in Ephesians 1 today, Ephesians 1, 3 through 6.
[time=1178] Ephesians 1, 3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[time=1185] He's worthy of praise and the Psalms say that as we pray, we should lift up our hands.
[time=1191] It says in 1 Timothy, we should lift up our hands.
[time=1193] The men of the church should do that as they pray.
[time=1196] So let's all together bow our heads and close our eyes as we prepare to hear from God's word
[time=1202] this morning and if you feel comfortable, if you would raise your hands as we pray.
[time=1210] This morning, Father, we declare together that you are worthy of praise and honor and glory and power.
[time=1221] We proclaim this morning that you are a God to be blessed, to be praised, to be made much of.
[time=1230] And so in this place, in this gathering this morning, we pause before we start and we thank you and we bless your name, Heavenly Father, you desire us to call you Father.
[time=1241] You've made it possible because of what your son, Jesus, has done.
[time=1244] And so we lift our hands, God, in prayer and in praise and we thank you for your goodness
[time=1250] and your offer of salvation to us and the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1254] We pray all these things with great thanksgiving.
[time=1257] [AMEN] Ephesians 1 is our text for this morning.
[time=1263] There was a Roman emperor named Justinian in the 500s.
[time=1268] He was emperor and he's most well known for a system of laws that he wrote down.
[time=1273] It's called the Justinian code in case you're wondering.
[time=1276] And in that whole law record that he put down, that code he put down, he talks a lot about
[time=1283] or at least in part about adoption.
[time=1286] And I want to read this with you because it's staggering and you need to see this or hear
[time=1293] this so you can hear what Paul says in Ephesians 1, I think, in the way that you should.
[time=1299] So here's what Justinian says about the process of adoption in the first century.
[time=1304] The one being adopted and if there were any children in his power, passed into the power
[time=1311] of the one adopting, the property of the one being adopted, of whatever kind, all the debts
[time=1318] due to him passed to the one adopting by a kind of universal succession.
[time=1324] Deaths do by the one being adopted and the personal service, if any was offered, if they
[time=1331] were a slave, was all gone.
[time=1333] It was extinguished as a consequence of the extinction of his old persona resulting from
[time=1340] the adoption.
[time=1341] Do you hear that language?
[time=1343] His old persona was extinguished.
[time=1346] There's more.
[time=1348] In other words, all the debts of the one being adopted were canceled.
[time=1353] And in effect, he started a new life.
[time=1358] He gained the rights of a fully legitimate son in his new family.
[time=1362] In the most basic sense and the most literal way, he got a new father.
[time=1369] His new father has the same control over him as he would over his biological children.
[time=1375] In adoption, a person had to pass completely from one to another.
[time=1382] The father was liable for his new child's actions and each owed duties of support and maintenance to the other.
[time=1389] It's important to keep in mind this adoption does not include a change in the nature of the person but a change of status.
[time=1396] As can be seen in the process of adoption here, a father could disown his natural son.
[time=1403] But this was not an option with his adopted son.
[time=1409] Once you were adopted into this new family, the bonds could not be broken.
[time=1417] Friends, that's in Paul's mind as he writes to the church at Ephesus and he mentions this
[time=1424] in Ephesus 4 and 5 of Ephesians 1.
[time=1427] That's where I'll be just for a minute here before he gets started.
[time=1430] Ephesians 1 verses 4 into 5.
[time=1433] It says, "In love, he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ according to the purpose of his will."
[time=1445] That's what that word adoption looks like in the mind of Paul in the first century.
[time=1451] A whole new status.
[time=1453] A different family.
[time=1454] All debts cancelled.
[time=1458] All privileges and responsibilities that a new son would be owed are now available to the adopted person.
[time=1463] Isn't that amazing?
[time=1466] That's amazing.
[time=1467] In this place, something is happening.
[time=1471] It's been happening for a long time for over a year and a half now.
[time=1476] This place is excited about adoption.
[time=1481] Something's going on.
[time=1482] Just look around.
[time=1483] Just pay attention.
[time=1485] We have supported in the last two December's as our own.
[time=1490] We've given them almost half a million dollars.
[time=1494] Why?
[time=1496] Because horizontal adoption.
[time=1499] Horizontal adoption is a marvelous picture.
[time=1502] Maybe the most marvelous picture of what is going on because of what Christ has done.
[time=1508] That's why we're so excited about it.
[time=1510] In fact, an inspiration for this morning was a little clip by John Piper called, "Adoption is greater than the universe."
[time=1517] And the reason he said that was because it says, in Ephesians 1, "Before the foundation of the world, God made choices for adoption."
[time=1526] But before the world was, it was on his mind before the world was even founded.
[time=1531] That's amazing.
[time=1534] Amazing.
[time=1535] Let's read Ephesians 1, starting with verse 3, and jumping here this morning.
[time=1539] There are four words in your bulletin.
[time=1540] If you have your bulletin with you this morning, there are just some words that I'll lay out before you that are just marvelous realities because of what it is that Christ has done.
[time=1548] And we'll talk a little bit this morning along the way about what God has done in the person of Christ.
[time=1555] What that means for us, there are some things we'll talk about throughout the morning about ways that were involved as a church in adoption or adoptive ministries, and I can't wait to talk about it.
[time=1565] I was leaning forward, and I see this morning, get ready to come up here.
[time=1568] I was so excited.
[time=1569] This will not be on the screens behind me, but I wanted to take you to Galatians 4.
[time=1574] Galatians 4, and the first seven verses of that letter, Galatians is to the left of Ephesians in your Bible.
[time=1581] Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Go, Eat, Pop, Corn.
[time=1585] If that helps you, Galatians 4.
[time=1588] So Galatians 4 verses 1 through 7.
[time=1591] Paul is writing to the churches in a region called Galatia 2.
[time=1596] Here's what he says about this whole notion of adoption.
[time=1600] I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, though he is the owner of everything, but he's under guardians and managers until the date set by his father.
[time=1610] In the same way also, when we were children, we were enslaved to the elementary principles of the world, but when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his son, born of woman, born of the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.
[time=1629] And because you are sons, God has sent the spirit of his son into our hearts, crying, Abba, father.
[time=1637] So you are no longer a slave but a son.
[time=1641] And if a son, then an heir, through God, we have not merely been saved from things.
[time=1649] We have been saved to things, to a glorious inheritance, certainly then, but also now.
[time=1656] That's the reality that we face in Jesus, friends.
[time=1659] That's what he has made available to us because of last weekend, because of Good Friday and Resurrection Sunday, all of these things are possible.
[time=1668] In fact, anything is possible because Christ is risen from the dead.
[time=1672] Amen?
[time=1675] We should be resurrection people.
[time=1678] I got an email from a friend this week that said that that was on a banner at a church growing up.
[time=1682] We are resurrection people, we are Easter people, and Hallelujah is our song.
[time=1687] I said, Amen.
[time=1689] That's great.
[time=1690] We should be Easter people, resurrection people, every Sunday, all the time.
[time=1695] Ephesians 1, verse 3.
[time=1697] Here we go.
[time=1700] That's to the right from Galatians.
[time=1702] Ephesians 1.
[time=1705] The first word in your outline, this morning in your Boltons, friends, is that we're blessed.
[time=1711] We are blessed because God has blessed us.
[time=1715] We have received these things from him.
[time=1717] Here's what it says in verse 3 of Ephesians 1.
[time=1720] Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.
[time=1731] Paul wrote 13 letters in the New Testament.
[time=1734] There's 27 books in the Holy Testament, we call that from Matthew to Revelation.
[time=1738] Paul wrote almost half, and in every single one of them he calls Godfather.
[time=1743] Every single one, usually in the first couple verses, it's right out of the gate.
[time=1748] The fatherhood of God is primary in the mind of Paul.
[time=1752] He wants you to know that God is a father.
[time=1755] So what do we know about God?
[time=1757] If that's all we knew, we knew that God desires to be in relationship.
[time=1761] The word father is a word that should imply relationship, and if it doesn't imply that for you because maybe your father wasn't there or wasn't what he should be, you can see that God is the father that you really need at the deepest levels
[time=1776] and has promised to be that for you, to be present for you in a way that you really want, deep in your heart.
[time=1783] J.I. Packer in a book called Knowing God, if you don't have this book knowing God, I would encourage it, I would encourage you to look it up.
[time=1790] He said it this way.
[time=1792] Everything that Christ taught, everything that makes the New Testament new and better than the old, everything that is distinctly Christian, as opposed to merely Jewish, is summed up in the knowledge of the fatherhood of God.
[time=1806] Father, he said, is the Christian name for God.
[time=1811] I mentioned earlier that something is going on in our church about adoption, about this idea of the fatherhood of God.
[time=1819] New Life Home Trust is one of the organizations that we have partnered with here as a church, and we have for many, many years.
[time=1827] They are in Nairobi, Kenya.
[time=1830] Kendia Andrion was in the first row here in the choir on the far left. She's going to Nairobi, Kenya as well to care for children, to offer them help, to rescue them.
[time=1840] We support her as a church.
[time=1842] But New Life Home Trust is doing the same work in Nairobi.
[time=1846] They seek to identify and bring babies and children into residential or community care programs, to provide them with a compassionate remedy to their spiritual, physical, emotional, economic, sociological needs, all of it.
[time=1859] They rescue babies, often from the trash.
[time=1866] They rescue abandoned babies. They've given priority babies with HIV.
[time=1871] In 2012, they released 125 babies into adoptive care.
[time=1876] They rescued over 1,500 babies since their inception 20 years ago, marvelous.
[time=1882] They are the source of 40% of all the children adopted in Kenya.
[time=1886] That's an incredible statistic.
[time=1890] New Hope Uganda, Caleb and Allaire Mitchell are our dear friends.
[time=1894] They're neighbors to Kenya.
[time=1896] Same work.
[time=1897] Their whole organization is founded around the fatherhood of God.
[time=1901] Why?
[time=1902] Why Andrea?
[time=1903] Why New Life Home Trust?
[time=1905] Why New Hope Uganda?
[time=1907] Because we understand, I think at deep levels, that this horizontal adoption, care for children,
[time=1915] is a picture to the world of what God has done and is doing in the person of Jesus.
[time=1921] That's why we're so excited about it. We should be excited about it.
[time=1924] The world watches and says, okay, I see you.
[time=1929] It's a good thing. It's a really good thing.
[time=1932] Ephesians 1-3 says that he has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing.
[time=1938] God has not been stingy.
[time=1941] Every spiritual blessing in the original language means every spiritual blessing.
[time=1946] It's all available to us.
[time=1948] But you know who is the greatest blessing or what is the greatest blessing?
[time=1952] Jesus.
[time=1954] [AMEN] I'll say that again and I'd like you to respond if you would.
[time=1958] It encourages guys like us when you do that.
[time=1960] The greatest blessing in the world is Jesus.
[time=1964] [AMEN] All right.
[time=1966] I was thinking about this last week as Kelly was talking about heaven.
[time=1971] I heard this somewhere. I forget where originally.
[time=1974] But here's the question.
[time=1976] If you could go to heaven and have no pain, no suffering, never thirst, never be tired,
[time=1987] live a life of complete joy, but Jesus wasn't there.
[time=1992] We just don't want to go.
[time=1996] I think a lot of people, maybe in this room, maybe you asked that question and you're like, "Why?" "I don't know. No pain sounds pretty good. No suffering sounds pretty good.
[time=2005] Complete joy. I don't know." I think we can step in and help.
[time=2011] Who's Jesus?
[time=2014] Every spiritual blessing in Christ.
[time=2018] Would you want to go to a place where he wasn't?
[time=2021] Let's talk about it for just a minute.
[time=2024] 2 Corinthians 4, 6.
[time=2026] Jot that reference down in your notes.
[time=2028] 2 Corinthians 4, 6.
[time=2030] I don't know if there's any more important question that we can ask or answer them.
[time=2035] We ask during myth butters.
[time=2036] Who's Jesus?
[time=2037] Who is he?
[time=2038] It's a really important question.
[time=2040] It will help you figure out what I want to go to heaven if he wasn't there.
[time=2044] Chris just said a minute ago that you couldn't go without him and he's right.
[time=2048] So maybe it's a trick question. I don't know.
[time=2051] For God who said let light shine out of darkness has shown in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[time=2061] The light of the knowledge of the glory of God in Jesus and his face.
[time=2066] Colossians 1, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians.
[time=2070] It's 2 over from Ephesians, Colossians 1, starting in verse 15.
[time=2075] "Bless me the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed with every spiritual blessing in Christ." That's the verse.
[time=2081] Well, like what?
[time=2083] He, that is Jesus, Colossians 1, 15, is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
[time=2089] For by him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, thrones, dominions, rulers or authorities.
[time=2096] All things were created through him and for him, by him, through him, for him.
[time=2101] All things.
[time=2102] He is the image, it says, of the invisible God.
[time=2107] I know what God is like because of Jesus and I can't know God without Jesus.
[time=2112] That's what he says.
[time=2113] The Bible proclaims that message.
[time=2115] I proclaim it to you this morning.
[time=2117] You cannot know him without Jesus.
[time=2121] So you don't want to go to a place where he's not.
[time=2125] That would be hell.
[time=2127] Hell is a place where he's not there.
[time=2132] Charles Spurgeon said it like this and only Charles Spurgeon can say it.
[time=2137] There is one name that will last when all others have died out and that name is connected with blessing and only with blessing.
[time=2146] Jesus Christ came into the world on purpose to bless men.
[time=2150] Men as a race find in him a blessing wide as the world.
[time=2155] Christ is all blessing.
[time=2159] When you have written down his name, you have pointed to the fountain from which all blessings flow.
[time=2165] You have named that son of righteousness to whose beams we owe every good and perfect gift from the beginning.
[time=2172] Throughout all eternity, the Lord Jesus blesses men.
[time=2177] You don't want to go someplace where he's not.
[time=2180] You don't want to do that.
[time=2182] Friends, this phrase in Ephesians 1 is everywhere in Christ.
[time=2187] In Christ.
[time=2188] It's everywhere through Christ.
[time=2190] It's everywhere you go on purpose.
[time=2193] He is the greatest blessing.
[time=2195] And we would hate for you to leave this place without experiencing that blessing personally.
[time=2201] Without knowing God as a father through what his son has done on your behalf.
[time=2206] Please come talk to us.
[time=2208] A spiritual blessing, by the way, isn't like this other worldly blessing.
[time=2212] It's all that God's spirit does to enable you to live your life.
[time=2215] That's a spiritual blessing.
[time=2217] I'll say it again.
[time=2218] It's all that God's spirit is doing and bringing to enable your life.
[time=2223] That's a spiritual blessing.
[time=2225] It isn't something hovering out here.
[time=2227] It's right here.
[time=2231] Blessed.
[time=2232] And we're certainly blessed in the person of Jesus, but there's more.
[time=2236] Number two, verse four.
[time=2239] Even as he chose us in him, that's Jesus.
[time=2242] Before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and blameless before him.
[time=2247] Number two is blameless.
[time=2251] Blameless.
[time=2253] New Testament scholar named A.J. Gossip wrote a book called The Galilean Accent.
[time=2259] I love this book.
[time=2260] I find myself quoting from it all the time.
[time=2262] Here's what he said about our lives, this idea of holiness and blamelessness.
[time=2268] Here's what he said.
[time=2269] This was really helpful to me.
[time=2272] You two are called to be an open letter.
[time=2276] As Paul puts it, written by Christ's own hand, showing those round about you what things Christ can do.
[time=2284] We are to go into the world and so to live our ordinary lives that all unconsciously to us,
[time=2290] those among whom we move, will look at us again and begin to say, you know, I used to doubt that there was much in Christianity's saved talk, but I've revised my opinion.
[time=2301] Look at how they live.
[time=2303] Look at how they love one another.
[time=2306] Look how they serve the least of these.
[time=2309] Look how they serve babies left in trash heaps.
[time=2315] I have revised my opinion.
[time=2318] There is more to Christianity than just talk.
[time=2322] It is a witness to the world.
[time=2325] We all look at an organization like as our own.
[time=2330] As our own is a Christ-based, community-driven movement in India,
[time=2336] awareness bracelet for a couple of years.
[time=2338] I'm going to wear it for a lot longer or willing.
[time=2341] Rescue vulnerable children from certain enslavement and exploitation, caring for them as their own.
[time=2349] They rescue children from treacherous situations.
[time=2351] They provide life long aftercare for the rescue.
[time=2355] They are now part of our family for life.
[time=2358] We transform communities to prevent higher situations that create the need for children to be enslaved in the first place.
[time=2366] That's their passion.
[time=2367] We have partnered with them.
[time=2370] They have been sacrificially given to this incredible cause of rescuing children, friends.
[time=2375] Why?
[time=2376] Why have you done that?
[time=2377] Because it makes Jesus look beautiful.
[time=2379] Because it's the gospel on display.
[time=2381] It's the good news that you weren't pretty good and God kind of scrubbed you off and sent you on your way.
[time=2385] That you were a slave to sin and so was I.
[time=2388] Without God, without hope in the world, he's made you alive in Christ.
[time=2394] As our own does not believe the girls that they serve are rescued until they embrace Christ as Savior.
[time=2403] And I can tell you how encouraging that is to me.
[time=2405] We have a tangible connection to a story.
[time=2408] It's connected to the story, the story of the universe, the music of the universe.
[time=2413] As our own is helping us to dance to it, helping us to sing the music of the universe that God is composing.
[time=2419] What a beautiful thing that is.
[time=2423] Colossians 1 says this.
[time=2427] Verse 21.
[time=2429] "And you who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him, if indeed you continue in the faith."
[time=2446] Stable instead fast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven of which I, Paul, became a minister.
[time=2459] Marvelous picture of what's going on in the heavenlies is happening right in front of us.
[time=2466] Holy and blameless.
[time=2468] Holy is about moral purity.
[time=2470] Again, not just saved from things, but saved two things that hell is not the destiny of a person who has agreed with God about himself and agree with God about Jesus.
[time=2480] Hell is not that person's destiny.
[time=2482] I'm so happy to tell you that this morning.
[time=2484] Hope you're excited about that.
[time=2486] The second thing I would say is that that's true, but it doesn't stop there.
[time=2491] I'm not going to hell and I'm so glad.
[time=2493] I am glad.
[time=2495] I don't want to go to hell.
[time=2497] No one in their right mind wants to, but we're saved to holiness.
[time=2502] The Bible is very clear about this empowered by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2506] Blameless, it says, holy and blameless before him.
[time=2510] Freedom from the guilt of our trespasses.
[time=2512] In other words, trespasses, a word that we know is like no trespassing, but we step over lines all the time.
[time=2518] Trespasses and sins, we have freedom from that guilt that we once walked in.
[time=2525] How beautiful is that?
[time=2527] The enemy's major tool in your life, friends, is to leverage you with guilt and shame and accusation.
[time=2533] You can't do that.
[time=2535] Who do you think you are?
[time=2537] You're just better than that.
[time=2539] And God in Christ is no.
[time=2540] It's not who you are.
[time=2542] Ephesians 2 says that you were dead and your trespasses and sins, but God made you alive in Jesus.
[time=2551] To put his great and miserable grace on display, Ephesians 2, 1 through 7.
[time=2557] The second number in your both and friends is blameless.
[time=2560] We have been blessed and he has declared us to be blameless, even though our friends might say that we're not.
[time=2567] Even though you might feel like you're not, what does God say about you in Christ?
[time=2573] Blameless.
[time=2577] Death, where is your sting?
[time=2579] Swell it up in victory because of what Christ has done.
[time=2583] Blameless has also translated friends as without fault.
[time=2587] Unblemished.
[time=2589] No, I don't feel that way a lot of times, and that's part of what it means to think to be human.
[time=2594] I don't feel unblemished.
[time=2596] I feel like I got lots of stains all over me.
[time=2598] But don't let how you feel direct the way that you live.
[time=2607] Anchor your thoughts in what God says about you and agree with him there.
[time=2611] And you'll find freedom in your life.
[time=2614] Blessed.
[time=2616] Blameless.
[time=2617] Number 3.
[time=2618] In Christ, we've been given access and membership in a brotherhood.
[time=2625] 1 Peter 2 17 says honor everyone.
[time=2628] Love the brotherhood.
[time=2630] Fear God.
[time=2632] Honor the emperor.
[time=2634] This is how verse 5 reads in the new living translation.
[time=2637] I love it.
[time=2638] I want to read it with you.
[time=2640] God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself.
[time=2647] Through Jesus Christ.
[time=2649] This is what he wanted to do.
[time=2652] And it gave him great pleasure.
[time=2654] Isn't that beautiful?
[time=2655] What a beautiful explanation of that verse.
[time=2657] A beautiful unpacking of it.
[time=2659] God created the world so there would be space for him to bring people into his family.
[time=2666] Wow.
[time=2669] Of course I want to be involved in something like that.
[time=2672] The purpose of God's choice of his children was relational to bring them into a family.
[time=2679] A brotherhood.
[time=2681] I'm so glad.
[time=2683] I'm a part of the family of God.
[time=2687] And if you're not a part of the family of God, we want to talk to you about that too.
[time=2690] We want to invite you to come in because of what Christ has done.
[time=2693] Lay down your burdens and seek after him.
[time=2696] That is our great, great pleasure and joy to tell you that story.
[time=2701] Adoption as sons through Jesus Christ.
[time=2707] This is before the world's foundation.
[time=2709] He predestined us for adoption.
[time=2713] What a marvelous story.
[time=2715] Number four in your notes is benevolence.
[time=2720] Benevolence is another word for grace.
[time=2723] It's often a word that used in churches when they are giving to people who are in need.
[time=2728] Benevolence were blessed, were blameless before him, were part of a brotherhood.
[time=2738] And we are the recipients friends of benevolence, of grace, of kindness.
[time=2742] Listen to these verses from Titus 3.
[time=2744] I feel like I read these verses all the time.
[time=2746] I hope I never get tired of them.
[time=2750] This is another letter of the Paul route to a pastor on an island, an island called Crete.
[time=2757] He was having a hard time, so Paul is encouraging him.
[time=2761] Titus 3, verse 3, "For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions
[time=2772] and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.
[time=2779] But," do you have your Bible open?
[time=2781] If you do, circle the word "but." I love that word.
[time=2787] Everything in the passage just turns on that word.
[time=2790] But, what a beautiful word that is.
[time=2796] But, when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, He saved us.
[time=2804] Not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to His own mercy, by the washing
[time=2812] of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us richly.
[time=2818] Again, God is not Ebenezer's Scrooge.
[time=2823] Richly, through Jesus Christ that our Savior, there is that phrase again, so that being
[time=2832] justified by His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
[time=2838] Ayers, slaves to sons, sons as heirs.
[time=2842] This is the destiny of people that know Jesus.
[time=2847] I want to be about telling that story.
[time=2850] Grace at the root of all of it, friends, all of this in verse 6 was to the praise of His glorious grace,
[time=2858] with which He has blessed us, Ephesians 1, 6, in the beloved.
[time=2864] A predestination for adoption makes God look glorious.
[time=2872] We are now folded into His everlasting family of joy.
[time=2878] This is, again, John Piper on adoption, and I just can't tell you how encouraged I've been by this.
[time=2886] I don't think He was in His late fifties when He adopted His daughter, Talatha.
[time=2893] So He's putting His money where His mouth is.
[time=2897] Adoption in God's mind was not Plan B.
[time=2901] He predestined us for adoption before the creation of the world.
[time=2906] Plan A was not lots of children who never sinned and never need to be redeemed.
[time=2910] Plan A was creation, fall, redemption, adoption.
[time=2914] So the full range of God's glory and mercy and grace could be known by His adopted children.
[time=2922] Adoption was not second best.
[time=2924] It was planned from the beginning.
[time=2926] In our lives, He goes on, there is something uniquely precious about having children by birth.
[time=2935] That's a good plan.
[time=2937] Also something different, but also uniquely precious about adopting children.
[time=2941] Each has its own uniqueness.
[time=2944] Your choice to adopt children may be sequentially second, but doesn't have to be secondary.
[time=2951] It can be as precious and significant as having children by birth.
[time=2956] God is able to make adoption an A+ plan in our lives.
[time=2962] Beautiful, beautiful.
[time=2965] I'll call up James Arnold at this point to give you one way in which we as a church can come
[time=2974] alongside families who are at risk and, again, put on display the greatness of the gospel.
[time=2982] Good morning.
[time=2984] As Steve was talking about the great butt in Titus, it made me think of Ephesians 2, 1-10,
[time=2990] when it says that we were dead in our trespasses and sins, children of wrath, sons of disobedience, but God, rich in mercy because of the great love with which He loved us, made us alive together in Christ.
[time=3001] At the end, in 2-10, it says that it's not works, but we've been created to do good works
[time=3008] that God prepared beforehand.
[time=3010] How can we live that out as adopted children of God?
[time=3013] One of the ways that we can do that is through Safe Families for Children, which is part of the graphed ministry here at Blackhawk, but it's also a global ministry that was started in Chicago.
[time=3023] The core of Safe Families for Children is that it's a church ministry.
[time=3027] It's not a government ministry, completely ran by the church in which we have the opportunity.
[time=3033] At the core, to have host families live out biblical hospitality by opening their homes
[time=3040] for a certain amount of time to children who are vulnerable coming out of families in crisis.
[time=3048] And to do that, while the parents of those children receive the aid they need
[time=3055] and the discipleship they need from a family coach and other organizations in the church, and ministries in the church.
[time=3061] So here at Blackhawk, we already have two host families that have had the opportunity to have children in their home, and we need more.
[time=3068] And we also need family coaches who can come alongside those host families.
[time=3073] And we need many other things.
[time=3075] We need people who can pray for these families.
[time=3077] We need people who can give diapers when they need or prepare meals or drive kids to school.
[time=3082] And so it's just a great opportunity for us to be the church.
[time=3085] And I'd love to talk to you more about it.
[time=3087] There's a table out in the foyer that I'll meet you there and there's stuff I can hand out.
[time=3092] And then on May 18th, we're going to have an informational meeting right after second hour.
[time=3097] And then on May 31st, there'll be training for those who want to be host families who are interested in finding out more about it.
[time=3104] So come see me in the lobby. Thank you.
[time=3106] Thank you, James.
[time=3107] Thanks a lot.
[time=3108] Thank you.
[time=3115] Opportunities for application are everywhere.
[time=3119] Andrea Mushan right here.
[time=3120] Andrea, wave your hand to us.
[time=3122] Andrea, new life home trust as our own, grafted, and safe families.
[time=3128] Friends, there are all sorts of ways that you can be involved in giving feet to these theological things we've been talking about this morning.
[time=3135] We know that every single one of them is rooted in the truth of what the Scripture says about our need for Jesus.
[time=3142] As the band comes back up to lead us in worship again, we have things that we want to give to you for two reasons.
[time=3151] There are cards on tables around the room this morning for two reasons.
[time=3155] Number one, we want you to have information.
[time=3157] We want you to know what these organizations are doing and why they're doing it.
[time=3161] We want you to be more informed, but mostly we want you to pray.
[time=3165] Put this on your fridge.
[time=3166] Put it somewhere where you're going to see it every day that you'll be prompted to pray.
[time=3170] Not only for those that are involved in them currently, but how you might be involved.
[time=3174] James mentioned lots of particular ways, diapers.
[time=3178] Diapers, meals.
[time=3180] It's a simple thing that you can do that would be an unbelievable blessing to a family in crisis.
[time=3185] So there are any number of ways, friends, that this can be applied in your life today.
[time=3190] Please come down as a family as we sing in response to what God has done and take a card.
[time=3198] There aren't an unlimited supply of the cards, so be sparing as you take them, but we want you to pray.
[time=3204] We want you to be informed about what God is doing and how the great truth of our adoption in Christ
[time=3211] can be demonstrated in the way that we care for families both here and around the world.
[time=3216] Come as a family, come grab a card, and spend some time as we sing, as we worship, praying together
[time=3222] about how you might want to be involved in these things that God is doing.
[time=3246] You are my rescue, you never let go, I'm in my darkness.
[time=3268] He's for my soul, you are my rescue, you never let go.
[time=3288] All my hope is in you, all my strength is in you with every breath, my soul will rest in you.
[time=3308] Here in my weakness, always the same, your love is my shelter, your life is my way.
[time=3331] All my hope is in you, all my strength is in you with every breath, my soul will rest in you.
[time=3375] God, stand save your friend forever, Lord you have my heart.
[time=3397] Sure foundation, never failing, Lord you have my heart.
[time=3419] God, stand save your friend forever, Lord you have my heart.
[time=3441] Oh foundation, never failing, Lord you have my heart.
[time=3462] All my hope is in you, all my strength is in you with every breath, my soul will rest in you.
[time=3484] All the hope is in you with every breath, my soul will rest in you, with every breath, my soul will rest in you.
[time=3513] With every breath, with every breath, my soul will rest in you.
