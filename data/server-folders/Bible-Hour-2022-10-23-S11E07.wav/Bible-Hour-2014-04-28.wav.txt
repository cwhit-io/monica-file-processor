[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=31] Well, hello again and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=36] It's great to be with you, and I'm so thankful for what I believe is going to be an incredible few weeks as we jump into a new study here at Black Hawk on Sunday mornings, and I hope you'll join us.
[time=48] As you can see on the screen, the title of our new study is called The Land Between.
[time=53] The Land Between, and I want to explain it to you just briefly.
[time=57] I hope you'll be encouraged today as you listen, but it really is a study, if you will, from the book of Numbers, and it really is a close look again at the people of Israel.
[time=68] God's chosen people, the Jews, as they leave Egypt and make their way to the promised land.
[time=74] And I want to just remind you briefly this morning that the people of Israel, as they traveled through those 40 years, some of you know that's how long it took
[time=84] for them to get from Egypt to the promised land.
[time=87] You see, God wanted to teach them some things.
[time=90] God needed to show them some things.
[time=92] There were some things about them.
[time=96] There were some things about their minds and the way they were approaching life and God and living that God needed to adjust.
[time=104] And so oftentimes God will slow us down.
[time=108] Oftentimes God will bring circumstances, oftentimes God will even allow things to
[time=114] transpire, hard things, that leave us in this place of tension.
[time=119] It'll leave us in this place of confusion even.
[time=122] It will leave us in this place of trial and tribulation.
[time=126] And this is that place, the land between.
[time=130] This is a time in our life when we have to reconcile the fact that we're not where we once were and we're not yet where we're going.
[time=138] And God is absolutely committed to growing us and teaching us and showing us the things that He has for our lives, for our hearts and our character.
[time=148] And so I hope you'll join us on this journey.
[time=150] It's going to be a great study and one that I think while it'll give insight into the people of Israel and what God did in the desert.
[time=157] I think it'll give great insight as well to your life and to mine as we do our best to be a people who are following God faithfully.
[time=165] So I hope you'll join us.
[time=166] Thanks so much for tuning in.
[time=168] Thanks for being a part of our family.
[time=170] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=173] I'm going to teach you a new song this morning.
[time=184] This one focuses on an aspect to God that we probably don't talk about enough, maybe some like Christmas time, but that Jesus was divine and He was God.
[time=191] So divine and He was God's son, but what makes it really special in the way He can be so empathetic is that He was also 100% man at the same time that He was God.
[time=201] So we're going to read through a few of these verses and then I'll teach you the course before we get started.
[time=205] So it talks about you came to earth that you created.
[time=209] You walked beneath the stars that you named.
[time=212] You came from heaven holding freedom.
[time=214] Jesus Christ the Lord our God.
[time=216] And the second verse it talks about Him being completely God and completely man.
[time=220] And so the course goes like this.
[time=248] Listen then again.
[time=277] Listen together.
[time=304] You came to earth that you created.
[time=309] You walked beneath the stars that you named.
[time=318] You came from heaven holding freedom.
[time=325] Jesus Christ the Lord our God.
[time=330] I'm going to sing it.
[time=334] I'm going to sing it till my voice won't let me.
[time=341] As Sundays are all shall you praise.
[time=347] You're the God of everlasting wonder.
[time=354] You love our last the end of day.
[time=361] Are you offered life?
[time=375] Are you offered life and wrote yourself in?
[time=381] It's well and time that you designed.
[time=386] Create a legend in His creation.
[time=392] Completely man.
[time=396] Completely God.
[time=398] I'm going to sing it.
[time=399] I'm going to sing it till my voice won't let me.
[time=408] As Sundays are all shall you praise.
[time=414] You're the God of everlasting wonder.
[time=421] You love our last the end of day.
[time=438] Listen to me.
[time=441] I'll lift your name higher and higher.
[time=447] I'll sing your praise louder and louder.
[time=454] Your love goes deeper and deeper.
[time=460] You'll reign forever and ever again.
[time=467] I'll lift your name higher and higher.
[time=473] I'll sing your praise louder and louder.
[time=480] Your love goes deeper and deeper.
[time=487] You'll reign forever and ever again.
[time=518] I'll sing it till my voice won't let me.
[time=524] As Sundays are all shall you praise.
[time=531] You're the God of everlasting wonder.
[time=538] You love our last the end of day.
[time=545] I'm going to sing it till my voice won't let me.
[time=555] As Sundays are all shall you praise.
[time=562] You're the God of everlasting wonder.
[time=568] You love our last the end of days.
[time=575] Sing all that you name.
[time=587] I'll lift your name higher and higher.
[time=594] I'll sing your praise louder and louder.
[time=600] Your love goes deeper and deeper.
[time=607] You'll reign forever and ever again.
[time=613] I'll lift your name higher and higher.
[time=620] I'll sing your praise louder and louder.
[time=627] Your love goes deeper and deeper.
[time=634] You'll reign forever and ever again.
[time=641] I'll sing it till my voice won't let me.
[time=647] As Sundays are all shall you praise.
[time=655] You're the God of everlasting wonder.
[time=662] You love our last the end of day.
[time=668] I'm going to sing it till my voice won't let me.
[time=675] As Sundays are all shall you praise.
[time=681] You're the God of everlasting wonder.
[time=688] You love our last the end of day.
[time=705] People often quote the common proverb in times of pain, tragedy and transition.
[time=711] They say time heals all wounds.
[time=715] But this statement isn't necessarily true.
[time=718] Some people heal over time while others become deeply embittered.
[time=724] The land between that land of transition forces us to choose one way or the other.
[time=732] While offering us a place for growth, the land between can also be a desert where our faith goes to die if we let it.
[time=742] The habits of the heart that we foster in this space, this land between our response, our reactions will determine whether it results in spiritual life or spiritual death.
[time=755] We get to choose.
[time=762] We come this morning to what will ultimately be a five-week in-depth study of God's Word.
[time=774] We will be looking at the Old Testament book of Numbers in this study of this look at this interaction with God's Word.
[time=782] And just to remind everybody here real quick, this is what we do around here.
[time=787] This is what we do. We are at Black Hawk unwavering and unrelenting.
[time=791] In our commitment to teach to you, present to you, explain to you the life-changing, life-transforming truth of God's Word.
[time=801] And I know many of you, you give me the joy and the privilege of traveling and journeying through life with you.
[time=809] I understand at times what you think and feel and I realize there are some of you even here today
[time=815] and you think you've got someone, you think you've got something going on in your life that's going to really change or transform you.
[time=825] We live in a culture that has infomercialed us into a Bolivian with promises of better, better bodies and better bank accounts, better sex, better families, better lives,
[time=838] all of which they say comes with a five-set DVD for $99 down, but it doesn't work that way, does it?
[time=851] Better, better anything comes when you understand what God's Word says about it all.
[time=863] Better anything comes when you understand the truths of Scripture.
[time=868] What God's Word says about all those areas I just mentioned and then when you and I are willing to apply that Word to the everyday of our life, then you will be changed.
[time=882] Only then will we be transformed and so every chance we get here we continue to do our best to bring you the Bible, to bring you the Word of God in meaningful and relevant and oh how we hope helpful ways.
[time=900] And so we've entitled our new study from the book of Numbers this morning, The Land Between. This idea comes from a book that was written with the same title by Pastor Jeff Mannion, a wonderful teacher and leader from Ada Bible Church up in Michigan.
[time=917] And as you study through the book of Numbers, as you become familiar again with the story of the people of Israel, even as you read through Jeff's book in the beginning pages of his book,
[time=928] you begin to learn some very important initial truths regarding this land, this place that is between.
[time=939] With maybe the most important idea being as we start out this morning, its location.
[time=946] Where is it? As you hear me say the phrase, the land between, where is this land between? What does it look like? And so we'll jump in there.
[time=956] We'll look first of all at its location, but before we do, I want to, I want to do something that I think can be very, very helpful to all of us as we make our way into and through this discussion this morning.
[time=970] Adam's going to come and I'm going to invite all of you to stand and would you just, as you stand, take your Bible, your iPad, your phone, however it is that you're looking at the Scriptures, would you all just stand?
[time=981] And I want to read this to you this morning and let's, in honor of God's Word, let's stand and I want you to think about this.
[time=987] Oh, this morning my friends, as we read this at the beginning of this discussion, I hope and pray that you will hang on every word.
[time=995] I hope every line of what we're about to read will be something that you'll grab on to.
[time=1003] For many of you this will be a familiar few verses, but even if it's familiar, even if you've read it a thousand times, or maybe it's the first time you've ever seen it.
[time=1013] Oh, how I hope that in light of what we're about to talk about, what we're about to see in God's Word today and over these next few weeks.
[time=1023] Oh, how I hope this would be a truth that you would claim, that you would put your arms around and give yourself to.
[time=1032] For it says in the book of Proverbs, it says trust in the Lord with all your heart, not part of, not a little bit of.
[time=1045] No, it says trust in the Lord with all of your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.
[time=1055] In all of your ways that goes on to say, in all of your ways acknowledge Him.
[time=1063] In all of your ways acknowledge Him, not leaning on your own understanding, not leaning on your own assessment, not leaning on your own conclusions, not leaning on your own thinking.
[time=1077] No, it says in all of your ways acknowledge Him.
[time=1082] Set Him up, look to Him, and He will make your paths, what's it say?
[time=1089] Say it louder.
[time=1091] You know what straight means? Straight means right. Straight means good. Straight means life. Straight means what God designed.
[time=1102] God didn't design to the left or to the right, no, He told His people to go straight through.
[time=1108] And so I just hope and pray that you'll hold on to this. Pray with me Father in Heaven.
[time=1114] I pray for these dear friends as we stand here on the verge of a study that I believe could help and encourage and grow so many of us.
[time=1123] Oh Father, would you give us the strength and courage to trust in you, to acknowledge you, to live under and in submission to you and your ways, and may all of that make even more sense as we give ourselves to these next few moments.
[time=1142] And everybody agreed and said from their hearts, amen, amen, you can have a seat.
[time=1149] Let's look at the location, the location of the land between.
[time=1155] What is this place we're talking about? Where is it? What does it look like? Here you go.
[time=1160] You graduate from college having passionately pursued your degree in business or history or biochemistry, and today you are a proud scanner of cargo shorts at the same retail clothing store.
[time=1175] You first worked out as a high school sophomore. Welcome, say it with me, to the land between.
[time=1183] Or maybe you're unemployed. Maybe you'd love to be scanning cargo shorts anywhere.
[time=1194] You sent out more resumes and filled out more applications than you can remember, you're worried, you're anxious, and you're just not sure at all how much longer you can last, emotionally, not to mention financially.
[time=1208] Welcome to the land between.
[time=1212] You've recently been divorced, or you're currently going through a very difficult separation, or you're newly married, and wrestling with those challenges.
[time=1224] Challenges that at times seem overwhelming, scary, and hard to navigate, welcome to the land between.
[time=1231] You're pregnant, and everything is about to change.
[time=1247] Or you're just starting out on the journey of parenting adolescents, and say it with me, everything is about to change.
[time=1257] Welcome to the land between. You see, the land between is this place, it is this season of life, my friends.
[time=1264] When you're not where you once were, and you've not yet arrived where God is taking you, know you find yourself in this land between.
[time=1274] You're fighting disease.
[time=1277] Maybe somebody here in the room this morning, I actually know of a couple. Does that look around?
[time=1283] You're fighting disease and sickness, and it is a painful, and can be a very lonely fight.
[time=1292] Maybe you're battling depression, and in all honesty, the days seem to be getting darker, winds seem to be blowing harder.
[time=1300] Or you're trying to navigate the destructive patterns of addiction, addiction that runs deep and seems bent on ruining every hope and dream you ever possessed.
[time=1311] Disease, sickness, depression, addiction, the battle, welcome to the land between.
[time=1321] For some of you, you are alone now.
[time=1325] Or feeling incomplete, little lost due to death. A spouse has passed away.
[time=1334] A baby has died in its sleep. A loved one is now gone.
[time=1341] Or your business. Your business is failing. For many of you, you're living in this daily reality.
[time=1348] Even as I speak, you're not only struggling to figure out how to pay your employees this month, you're not even sure you'll have enough to make your own house payment.
[time=1358] Welcome to the land between.
[time=1361] Or you're in ministry.
[time=1364] You're in ministry. You're giving your life to the great cause of the kingdom, and it seems to just get more and more discouraging.
[time=1372] People are critical and mean-spirited as your flaws at times outweigh your strengths.
[time=1377] There are ministry leaders here in this room this morning.
[time=1381] There are ministry leaders who are watching this broadcast, sitting alone on a Sunday morning in a living room.
[time=1388] There are those who are tuning in right now, watching on live stream, and you're ready. You're ready to quit.
[time=1396] You're tired and weary of the disunity. You're tired and weary of feeling inadequate.
[time=1401] The joy of ministry seems to be gone. Why are you still doing this? You say to yourself.
[time=1411] Welcome to the land between.
[time=1415] Those are some locations, if you will. There is also, I want you to understand, a language that gets spoken in this place.
[time=1423] There is a language of the land between.
[time=1427] People who are in the land between say things like, "Oh God, how much longer? How much longer can I endure?"
[time=1433] They say things like, "How did I get here, and when will I ever leave?" "Where did those moms and dads look at pictures of families from 10, 15 years ago?" And they say things like, "Where did those carefree days of innocence go?"
[time=1450] People cry out, "Will I ever feel whole again?" People lament, "I want out." People in desperation say, "Is there anyone who truly cares? This is the language of the land between.
[time=1466] How will I ever make this right?" You're in the land between.
[time=1475] As you hear these things, and as you sense these realities, and this sense, these things you hear,
[time=1481] this reality of things transpiring around you, it is just like what happens in the people of Israel.
[time=1488] Just like what goes on in the lives of the Israelites, in the Old Testament book of Exodus, and even here in the book of Numbers.
[time=1495] I want to just real quick, before we look there, I want to show you a map. It's sort of like a rest stop when you're trying to figure out where you are.
[time=1501] This is just a little visual for the land between. I want you to understand, this comes from a very real story with very real people
[time=1508] who were the chosen, loved people of God, the nation of Israel, who had for hundreds and hundreds of years been in captivity.
[time=1515] They had been slaves. You see over here on the left all that green stuff, you can kind of tell that's a river, and that's kind of a delta.
[time=1523] That's the what river? Anybody want to take a guess? It's the Nile River, and that country there is the country of Egypt.
[time=1531] And even though it was green, it's where they almost died and were extinguished. Many did die in this awful place of bondage.
[time=1539] That's over there. God says he wants to take his people from there up. Look at the top, it gets a little greener up there.
[time=1546] That's called the promised land, and as we pick up the story and as we jump into this study over these few weeks, we're going to find the people of Israel not where they once were.
[time=1558] And not yet having arrived where they were going, they find themselves where that dot is in the middle of a desert called the Sinai, and it wasn't a good place.
[time=1570] It's a hard place. It's a difficult place. Very difficult.
[time=1576] It says in Exodus 3, if you'll turn there, or if you don't have a Bible, you're welcome to look up on the screen.
[time=1583] It says in the book of Exodus chapter 3, just so you get some context and some backdrop, this is the encounter that Moses has with the person of God himself.
[time=1595] It's the burning bush encounter up on the Mount, and it says there in Exodus 3, verse 5, that he said, God says in verse 5, "Do not come near here, remove your sandals from your feet for the place on which you are standing as holy ground."
[time=1612] He said, "Also I am the God of your Father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."
[time=1619] And Moses hid his face, or he was afraid to look at God, and the Lord said in verse 7, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have given heed to their cry.
[time=1634] I have heard their cry. I have taken it in. I am exercising sensitivity. This is what giving heed to their cry means because of their taskmasters, for I am aware of their sufferings.
[time=1646] So I have come down," verse 8, "to deliver them from the power of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land, to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Parazite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite."
[time=1670] A bunch of folks that were about to get evicted. Now behold, verse 9, "The cry of the sons of Israel has come to me. Furthermore, I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them."
[time=1683] This is where it begins. My friends, and there's a couple of things I want to make sure I point out to you right there as we start.
[time=1688] Number one, I want you to know this. Actually, just go back and look at it real quick. If you look at verse 8, can we throw a verse 8 back up on the screen?
[time=1696] It says, "So I have come down to deliver them from the power of the Egyptians." Watch this now. I want you to see what God's original sort of his original plan was as he lays this thing out.
[time=1707] Watch what he says to bring them up from that land, Egypt. Just look at the grammar of the sentence, up from that land to a good and spacious land.
[time=1719] The idea, I just want you to sense this, the idea is that he's going to take them from Egypt, they're going to go from Egypt to a good and spacious land.
[time=1728] It was about a two-week walk. But sometimes, as God walks you and me places, sometimes as he journeys us from here to there, he sees things.
[time=1749] He encounters things. He realizes there's stuff in you and there's things in me and there were things in the people of Israel that needed to get addressed.
[time=1761] And so a two-week walk becomes, anybody, 40 years, 40 years in the desert, in this land between, as God deals with and addresses things that had to be dealt with
[time=1778] and addressed in order for them to be the people God needed them to be.
[time=1786] The other thing I want you to note there before we move on is this, please don't miss this.
[time=1790] Please, each and every person here in this room this morning, please understand and know this to be true.
[time=1796] God, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who heard the cries of his people as they were mistreated, as they were tortured, as they were put into situations
[time=1807] of unbelievable discomfort, as they existed under the tyrannical rule of the Egyptian taskmaster as the people of God cried out for help.
[time=1820] And as it says there in the text that God heard their cry, I want to remind you this morning that he hears yours, that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob hears your cry.
[time=1833] He hears your heart, he hears your hurt, he hears your loneliness, he hears your confusion, he hears the things that go on in the confusion of your soul.
[time=1843] You are not missed, he is not deaf, he hears you.
[time=1849] And he responds, and he's alive, and he's on the throne, and he hasn't missed a thing.
[time=1857] And wherever it is you find yourself today, wherever it is that your pastor finds himself in whatever it is we're facing.
[time=1865] Not where we were, not yet where he's taking us.
[time=1871] Oh, how I hope you know that he hears you, and that he is at work.
[time=1877] So many of you know the story of the Exodus, after the onslaught of plagues and divine judgment against Egypt and even Pharaoh's own family, Pharaoh finally relents and frees the Israelites.
[time=1890] Remember God said Moses go to Pharaoh and tell him let my people go, and so he finally does, allowing them to begin their journey to this place called the Land of Promise.
[time=1900] So they leave Egypt after this unbelievable, unspeakable demonstration of God's faithfulness and goodness through the plagues and all of that, and then comes Exodus 14 and the whole Red Sea deliverance.
[time=1915] Oh my goodness, the waters part, the entire nation walks across on dry land, the text says, the Egyptians are held at bay and then summarily destroyed as God allows the parted sea to collapse on top of their evil effort to track down and capture
[time=1935] once again Moses and the people of God. And so now, and so now I'm certain as I read through this again in recent weeks and even as you hear it again this morning, wouldn't you just be certain that somewhere in the heart of God there had to be some level of expectation
[time=1952] that these cared for delivered, protected, provided for, freed, loved people of God would not only trust him but be grateful, be thankful, be, I hope you'll write this down, that they would be content.
[time=1969] That there would be a contentment in them, a contentment that was born out of the knowledge and the reality of what they had seen and experienced just weeks, just months, just days before.
[time=1985] But if you know the story, you know it, it doesn't quite go that way, and hey listen, let me just say this again, if you don't know the story, can I just say again how honored I am, how honored we are to get to have you here.
[time=1999] For anybody hearing these stories for the first time in your life, what a joy for us to get to share life changing, life transforming truth with you so we're thankful that we get to explain this again.
[time=2016] They're not filled, how sad they weren't filled, these people of God in the desert, they're not filled with gratitude, they're filled with something else.
[time=2029] Let's look at the book of Numbers, let's look at the Bible here and let's see how this thing starts to unravel.
[time=2036] It starts to unravel actually on a few points, not the least of which was in the way that God fed them.
[time=2045] Just think about it for a moment, you're in the desert, you have thousands and thousands and tens of thousands of people and God's got them on this criss-crossing journey as he educates and equips them and tries to build into them.
[time=2061] One thing God's got to do, one thing that has to happen is all these people have to eat, you've got to eat to survive and they're not back in Egypt anymore and so as you read through the story, you begin to become familiar with this idea of manna.
[time=2078] Raise your hand if you've ever heard of this story of manna.
[time=2081] Okay, good, many of you have, others if you haven't, manna was this flaky bread-like substance that God allows to fall from the sky, it comes in the morning with the dew and in the morning they would go out and collect up the manna.
[time=2098] And the manna, like I said, would fall every day and it was flaky and they would grind it and they would mix it with water and they would bake it and sometimes they would serve it like as mush, think of oatmeal, sometimes they would serve it in like cakes.
[time=2114] And it was pretty bland and it was pretty simple, it was just manna, the word manna means, the word manna actually means what is it because they didn't know what it was and they would call it manna, they called it what is it.
[time=2125] So they would eat what is it, each and every day and each and every morning and each and every noon and each and every dinner, morning, noon and night, breakfast, lunch and dinner, it was manna.
[time=2137] It was manna, manna, manna, flakes from the sky, mush, cakes, every single day.
[time=2147] God graciously, in the midst of their difficulty, provides manna, morning, noon and night, every single day, breakfast, lunch and dinner, have I made my point.
[time=2164] That's all that was there.
[time=2167] And so, watch this.
[time=2170] In the midst of this land between, in this time of difficulty and challenge, some people start to fade.
[time=2181] Numbers 11-4, the rabble, you always wondered what that word meant, you know what, the rabble?
[time=2189] Everybody know the rabble, this is an interesting story, the rabble were actually people who weren't necessarily Israelites, who were in, it's kind of funny when I thought about it this week.
[time=2200] They were actually people who were sort of on the outside looking in, they weren't Israelites, they were just kind of like hangers on, they were stragglers, they were in Egypt, they see everything that went on with God and Pharaoh and Moses and the plagues
[time=2216] and Pharaoh finally throwing his hands up and Pharaoh finally saying, get him out of here, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Israelites heading out of Egypt and the rabble were people who were kind of kind of pictured this way.
[time=2229] They weren't like really with the Israelites and they weren't kind of really with Egypt and they saw how this whole thing went and they kind of went, I think, I think I'll go with them.
[time=2238] And so they go with Israel and they're on the outskirts, they're just kind of along for the ride, so they're not really, really in it, they sort of are, but watch what happens, the rabble who were among them had greedy desires.
[time=2252] But it wasn't just them and also the sons of Israel wept again and said, and you have to read this with a whiny voice.
[time=2261] Everybody read this with a whiny voice, think of your kids when they whine, think of your wife, just don't forget your wife and your husband.
[time=2269] I'll just go with kids, think about your kids when they whine and say it to yourself with a whiny voice, who will give us meat to eat?
[time=2279] Is that whiny?
[time=2281] We remember the fish we used to eat free in Egypt, oh my gosh, they're talking about Egypt.
[time=2287] The cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic.
[time=2293] But now our appetite is gone, there's nothing at all to look at except this manna, whiny.
[time=2302] We want meat, we're sick of manna.
[time=2307] Now we're thinking about Egypt, wow.
[time=2311] How are you doing in your place?
[time=2319] What are you thinking?
[time=2321] What are you wanting?
[time=2324] Here you go, my friends, you might think that nothing grows in the desert.
[time=2330] But here's this week's, week one, here's this week's land between principle.
[time=2336] The land between is fertile soil, it is fertile ground, my friend, for the deadly practice of complaint.
[time=2346] For the deadly practice of complaining, oh write that down, complaint, complaint, we want meat.
[time=2357] Where's the cucumbers?
[time=2359] We had it better in Egypt.
[time=2363] Now I know there are some who think, come on.
[time=2366] And there are some who would look at all this, what I just said, and they would start to say things like this.
[time=2372] They would say, come on, it's not that bad.
[time=2375] And look at what God had done, look at the faithfulness of God, look at the goodness of God, look how God has shown up.
[time=2381] Eat the manna, come on, they would say.
[time=2383] Some of you are sitting here thinking to yourself, I would never.
[time=2386] I would never do that, I would never complain.
[time=2390] Ever.
[time=2394] But wait a minute, I would just caution you with that.
[time=2398] Think back on a time in your life, think back on a circumstance that you've endured.
[time=2403] Have you ever eaten the exact same thing again and again and again every single day, morning, noon and night?
[time=2410] Has there ever been an experience in your life when you have had to do something or eat something or drink something every single day, morning, noon, and I'm sort of having fun here, but I'm sort of not, bear with me.
[time=2421] Have you ever been through that?
[time=2423] I will tell you this right now, I'm 51 years old.
[time=2426] Sometimes I say this wrong because some people always called it different, it was different pronunciations of this.
[time=2433] But does anybody remember what they looked like?
[time=2438] Plastic noodles you put in hot water in college, we called it top ramen.
[time=2443] Anybody remember top ramen?
[time=2445] All right, I haven't had top ramen in 30 years.
[time=2449] I just want you to know that.
[time=2451] I'll die happy if I never in all of my life have top ramen again.
[time=2457] I ate top ramen in college for four years, morning, noon and night, when I wanted to get fancy, we'd drop an egg in it.
[time=2464] I could not begin to tell you how disgusting the thought of it, the smell of it, the look of a box, I go to a grocery store today,
[time=2472] I go down a different aisle instead of looking at a box of top ramen.
[time=2476] Now you may not be able to identify with that, I can, I understand this idea of you've got to be kidding me, get this away from me, I never want to see this again.
[time=2484] You see, here's the point, it's possible, listen, it's possible at times to look at a story like Numbers 11,
[time=2491] and place ourselves above the characters kind of in judgment.
[time=2496] What ungrateful, what ungrateful fools.
[time=2500] Better, better, probably healthier to place ourselves in the midst of among the characters and say it honestly,
[time=2508] and just say it right, that given the right set of circumstances, you and I would be more than likely to be right there with them, lost at times in our bitter complaint.
[time=2521] And oh how the word of God reminds you this morning, friends, oh how the word of God speaks to us church, to guard your hearts when traveling through the land between,
[time=2534] to guard your hearts from a spirit of complaint.
[time=2538] Look at the screen, Philippians 2.14 says it so well, Philippians 2.14 says do everything without complaining or arguing,
[time=2548] do everything without grumbling or dispute.
[time=2553] The word of God reminds us right there that in the circumstance that you find yourself in, in the current circumstances I find myself in when it's not making sense when the land between has risen up and stares us in the face.
[time=2570] The word of God warns you this morning, the word of God encourages you, do everything without complaining, without arguing.
[time=2580] James 5-7, I love the picture that gets painted here and James 5-7 says therefore be patient, brethren, be patient.
[time=2591] I love the next line because the next line doesn't say until tomorrow. The next line doesn't say until this thing gets figured out in a couple of hours.
[time=2601] The next line says be patient until the coming of the Lord. You may have to wait until this whole thing's over.
[time=2607] This thing, this challenge, whatever it is you're in the midst of, it may, you may need to endure it to be patient, he says.
[time=2616] Don't grumble, don't complain. The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it until it gets the early and late rains.
[time=2627] I love that picture of patients, that picture of waiting, the farmer knows, the farmer knows he has to, the farmer knows he has no choice, he's got no crop until the thing runs its course.
[time=2639] Don't complain, Ephesians 4-29, while not specifically addressing complaint, it addresses the spirit of complaint, it addresses the form through which oftentimes complaint comes, right?
[time=2653] Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, no bitter words, no impatient words, no complaining, no grumbling, we want meat.
[time=2664] No, no, he says don't do that. Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment so that it will give grace to those who hear.
[time=2677] Now, I want you to go back to Numbers. We started at 11-4, I actually want you to go back and look at verse 1, because verse 1, my friends, gives you this morning, a very powerful picture of how God views the spirit of complaint.
[time=2691] You want to know how God looks at those who complain, you want to kind of just get an inside perspective on how it is that God feels about somebody who would look him in the eye after all that he has done and say, you know what, I'd like a little garlic from Egypt.
[time=2709] Look what it says. Now, the people became like those who, what, complain of adversity, in the hearing of the Lord, that's like they didn't even try and hide it.
[time=2721] In the hearing of the Lord, they became like those who complained, and when the Lord heard it, his anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.
[time=2735] No time to get into all of that, but I just want you to get the picture. Okay, here's the camp. Here's the camp of all the Israelites, and they start to complain, and God just takes an outer edge and just goes, boom!
[time=2752] Just, his anger kindles, are you kidding me? He says. And when you study the text, I just want to tell you, he didn't just, he didn't just zap a few plants.
[time=2766] Life was lost. He singes, he fries the outskirts of a portion of the camp.
[time=2779] Because you're, you're, and me too, our complaining spirit. When you get right down to it, and what it's really saying is that important.
[time=2794] It goes on. The people therefore cried out to Moses, you think? And Moses prayed to the Lord, and the fire died out.
[time=2804] So the name of that place was called Tabera, because the fire of the Lord burned among those complaining, whiny people.
[time=2817] You see, this is actually pretty serious. You see, complaint in the land between can oftentimes go way beyond the manna, way beyond the disease, way beyond the lack of employment, the pregnancy, or the divorce.
[time=2832] It can, if you're not careful, and oh, I hope you'll not miss this, my friends, it can, if you're not careful, get turned against God.
[time=2841] Oh, have a hot son of the desert. Can get the heart and mind so sideways at times.
[time=2847] Now look at verse four again. I gave you one through three. Now go back to four. Now when you read four, it really starts to jump out at you.
[time=2854] The rabble who were among them had greed, desires, and also the sons of Israel. Wept again. They just got, they just got singed. The fire of God had just come down.
[time=2865] And they start in, in verse four, who will give us meat to eat. We remember the fish we used to eat for free in Egypt.
[time=2871] The cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, the garlic, but now, now, but now, but now that you've been delivered, but now that you've been free, but now that God has shown his faithfulness, but now you say.
[time=2886] But now our appetite is gone. There's nothing at all to look at except this. What is it? Man, I meant what is it? Man.
[time=2896] I would if I were you and I'm telling you this is how I feel. I get scared to death when I realize what they're really saying.
[time=2914] I get scared to death when I realize that it's what I could say and even have said at times.
[time=2922] When I'm not watchful and when I'm not careful and when I'm not thoughtful about this stuff.
[time=2928] Because listen, what they're saying and there's no other way of saying it. What they're saying is and what you and I say at times is God.
[time=2938] I was better off without you.
[time=2951] I want leeks and melons. I don't want you.
[time=2956] You can take your deliverance and you can take your protection and you can take your miraculous provision. Forget it.
[time=2964] I'm going to be lost in the spirit of complaint and I am going to an essence declare that we were better off without you.
[time=2976] Complaint can lead to questioning God's goodness.
[time=2981] I hope as you look at your digging deeper material today or even later in the week I hope you'll remember these things as the band makes their way up.
[time=2989] Complaint can lead to questioning God's goodness.
[time=2992] Oh my friends you don't want to do that. Complaint can lead to criticizing God's plan.
[time=2998] You don't want to do that because his sovereign plan is perfect.
[time=3003] Complaint can lead to withholding your trust. How did we start this morning?
[time=3007] Trust in the Lord with all of your heart and in the land between.
[time=3012] Don't lean on your own understanding. If there's ever a time you don't want to lean on your own understanding it would be in these places that we've described this morning.
[time=3021] Complaint can lead to questioning God's goodness criticizing God's plan withholding your trust.
[time=3028] You know why it works that way? I'm going to leave you with this.
[time=3031] Listen because complaint is at its core. Complaint is self-seeking. Complaint is self-indulgent.
[time=3041] Complaint is self-preserving. Complaint is all about you.
[time=3047] It's what you want. It's about what you think. It's about how you feel. It's about what you've concluded.
[time=3055] And God calls, called his people then. Oh how he longed for a people that would trust him.
[time=3065] And God calls for a people today who would do the same.
[time=3071] And the fact is my friends, this morning's very simple.
[time=3078] In the land between there is fertile soil for complaint. Complaint is deadly.
[time=3083] Don't complain. Trust. And like the old hymn says, used to sing it when I was a kid. Trust and what? Trust and obey.
[time=3092] Trust and here you go. Ready? Eat. Eat the manna. Just get up and eat the manna.
[time=3102] Just get up and obey. Get up and go forward today with difficulty and challenge but go forward in his design under his care.
[time=3111] Let's stand and let's sing. Let's worship our God this morning out of these great truths.
[time=3117] Let's worship Him together in spirit and in truth.
[time=3122] [MUSIC]
[time=3147] He's sitting with me this morning as we remember who that is.
[time=3152] [MUSIC]
[time=3157] Love for me. Coming on the clouds of fire. The whole earth shakes. The whole earth shakes.
[time=3172] [MUSIC]
[time=3179] I see His love and mercy. Washing over all I see. The people see. The people see.
[time=3196] Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna.
[time=3222] [MUSIC]
[time=3227] I see a generation. Finding love to take their place with selfless faith. Selfless faith.
[time=3245] I see a near revival. Stone as we pray and seek. We're on our knees. We're on our knees.
[time=3263] Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna hallelujah.
[time=3289] [MUSIC]
[time=3299] Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna, sing with me through my heart.
[time=3311] [MUSIC - 52 seconds]
[time=3389] Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna hallelujah.
[time=3402] [MUSIC]
[time=3430] [APPLAUSE]
[time=3435] [MUSIC]
[time=3439] People often quote the common proverb in times of pain, tragedy, and transition. They say time heals all wounds. But this statement isn't necessarily true. Some people heal over time while others become deeply embittered.
[time=3458] The land between that land of transition forces us to choose one way or the other. While offering us a place for growth, the land between can also be a desert where our faith goes to die if we let it.
[time=3475] The habits of the heart that we foster in this space, this land between our response, our reactions will determine whether it results in spiritual life or spiritual death. We get to choose.
[time=3490] [MUSIC]
[time=3497] Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna Hosanna hallelujah.
[time=3531] [APPLAUSE]
