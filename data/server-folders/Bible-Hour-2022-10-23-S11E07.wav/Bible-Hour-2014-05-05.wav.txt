[time=260] [APPLAUSE]
[time=270] >>Well, good morning and welcome to the broadcast.
[time=272] It's great to be with you again, and I am.
[time=275] We are here at Black Hawk.
[time=277] So grateful that we get to spend these moments with you each and every week.
[time=281] I want to also remind you for your own benefit, or maybe even for the benefit of others, all of our services, all of our teaching, everything that happens basically on a Sunday morning while you can catch it here on the broadcast.
[time=294] It's also available at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=298] If you go to our website and you click under the media section, the guys have done a great job of putting together opportunities there for you to go back through the archives of messages and teaching.
[time=310] And I hope that can be an encouragement to you.
[time=312] I want to make sure that you know that that's there.
[time=314] And I'm so grateful for the opportunity we have each and every week to broadcast what God is doing in our gathering as we come together each Sunday at 9 and 1045.
[time=326] Hey, I want to just say two things briefly.
[time=328] One is I want to remind every single one of you who are watching and listening today that we have a ministry available, a community of people that God is doing great things in and through.
[time=341] And it's a community of people.
[time=343] It's a ministry that meets on Wednesday nights at 7 o'clock and it's called Celebrate Recovery.
[time=348] Celebrate Recovery is a community of people that are absolutely dedicated and absolutely committed to pursuing the process of recovery, dealing with addiction, those sinful habits that each and every one of us encounter.
[time=365] This is not just for alcoholics.
[time=367] It's not just for those addicted to drugs.
[time=370] No, this is a community of people that provide love and accountability and encouragement for those dealing with anger, those dealing with codependency, those dealing with overeating, anything that controls us more than it should.
[time=386] Anything that controls us more than the spirit of God and the word of God.
[time=390] And so I hope that if there's something in your life that you know needs attention, if there is a struggle, a hurt, a hang up that continues to derail you in your life, I hope you'd come and visit on a Wednesday night at 7 o'clock here on our South Campus.
[time=407] We would love to introduce you to the Celebrate Recovery community and give you some hope and give you some help and walk alongside you.
[time=417] I also want to just pray for you.
[time=420] I've been praying for you.
[time=421] I mean that as you watch this broadcast, today's message really is about navigating discouragement.
[time=429] Today's message, as we continue in our study of the land between, is a message really aimed at people who may find themselves to some degree or another at the end of their rope or toward the end of what they feel like they can continue to endure.
[time=447] This is a message really aimed at people who have found themselves in need, real need of great help and assistance.
[time=454] And so I have been praying that God would open your heart and your eyes.
[time=458] There is hope.
[time=461] There is really truly a God whose goodness and graciousness still exists.
[time=467] And He wants to meet you in your place of need.
[time=470] And I hope this morning, the Word of God will speak to you in a powerful and encouraging way.
[time=475] God bless you.
[time=477] Hang in there and know that we love you.
[time=479] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=481] People often quote the common proverb in times of pain,
[time=490] tragedy, and transition.
[time=492] They say, time heals all wounds.
[time=496] But this statement isn't necessarily true.
[time=499] Some people heal over time, while others become deeply embittered.
[time=505] The land between.
[time=507] That land of transition forces us to choose one way or the other.
[time=512] While offering us a place for growth, the land between can also be a desert where our faith goes to die if we let it.
[time=520] The habits of the heart that we foster in this space, this land between, our response, our reactions will determine whether it results in spiritual life or spiritual death.
[time=534] We get to choose.
[time=535] Well, as the video said, we are in a new series, The Land Between.
[time=552] And last week we began this series.
[time=554] We started a new study tracking the Israelites, the people of God
[time=561] walking with them on their journey from the Exodus, from Egypt to the promised land in the book of Numbers.
[time=567] And we've entitled this series, The Land Between.
[time=570] There's been a great book written by that same title by Pastor Jeff Mannion in Ada, Michigan.
[time=576] And last week we tried our best to describe for you this land between.
[time=582] The land between is a place.
[time=584] It is a season in your life and mine of difficult transition.
[time=591] It is a place.
[time=592] It is a season in your life in mind of maybe family crisis.
[time=598] It's life after graduation.
[time=600] It's dealing with death.
[time=602] It's the confusion of disease and sickness.
[time=606] It's job loss.
[time=607] It's divorce.
[time=608] It's kids in rebellion.
[time=611] The land between is a place of difficulty.
[time=614] It is a place and a season of testing.
[time=617] It is a place of uncertainty.
[time=621] It's the land between.
[time=622] It is a place much like the desert of Sinai where the people of Israel find themselves in the book of Numbers.
[time=629] We showed you a map last week and we'll show you that map again.
[time=633] There it is right there.
[time=635] And as you look at that map, you realize they were the people of Israel were there on the red dot and what we realized last week was that many of you are there as well.
[time=646] God had delivered them.
[time=648] God had heard their cry in the land of Egypt where they were being oppressed and mistreated.
[time=654] He had delivered them through the plagues out of Egypt.
[time=658] He had promised them to take them to this land of promise.
[time=663] The delivery would one day be ultimate.
[time=666] And yet they find themselves in the middle.
[time=669] They find themselves in this place of transition.
[time=672] They weren't where they used to be and they have yet to arrive at the place where God was leading them.
[time=678] They find themselves in this land between and many of you find yourselves traveling through that same desert this morning.
[time=689] I want you to remember this.
[time=690] My friends, as we start this morning, remember bottom line, there was great purpose in this.
[time=699] There was something that God had in store.
[time=701] There was something that God had designed for His people.
[time=705] And I want you to remember this morning that God has designed the same thing for you.
[time=709] Yes, God is preparing you like He was trying to do with Israel for a huge opportunity.
[time=718] You.
[time=719] God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of the Bible, God Almighty is preparing, wanting to prepare you for
[time=729] something special, for something huge, for something significant as it relates to the opportunity He has for you to help move His kingdom forward.
[time=742] Like with Israel.
[time=744] Oh, church, please hear this today.
[time=748] Work with Israel.
[time=749] God longs for you to be a light among your coworkers, a light among your neighbors, a light among your friends and family.
[time=757] My friends, this is what we call the nations.
[time=761] God longs for you to be a light among the nations.
[time=764] You are supposed to be His chosen people.
[time=766] Look what it says in 1 Peter 2.9.
[time=768] You'll see this on the screen and you'll notice some of you old testament language, but don't forget this was written to the New Testament church, because what God had designed for Israel, now God has called you and I to fulfill.
[time=781] Look what it says.
[time=782] It says, but you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood.
[time=786] You.
[time=787] You are.
[time=788] It says here, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession.
[time=793] Why?
[time=794] So that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
[time=805] You are supposed to be his chosen people, representing him in your heart, your actions, your attitudes, your deeds to move his kingdom forward.
[time=816] And he will walk you through the desert if he has to.
[time=822] In order to teach you, in order to grow you, in order to prepare you for great things.
[time=829] Welcome to the land between.
[time=832] So what did we learn last week?
[time=834] What did we see last week?
[time=835] We learned that the land between was and still is.
[time=839] It was for them and it is for you and for me fertile soil.
[time=845] For this thing we called the spirit of complaint.
[time=849] And if you weren't here last week, I hope you'll write that down as we start this morning.
[time=853] Last week we saw that the land between is fertile soil for the spirit of complaint.
[time=857] I told you last week to guard your heart.
[time=862] When traveling through the land between, to guard your heart from the spirit of complaint, Paul encouraged those that Philippi in the very same vein in Philippians 2, 14, we looked at it last week.
[time=873] I'll show it to you.
[time=874] Again, do all things, Paul said.
[time=875] Do everything, whatever it is you encounter, whatever it is that you find yourself in the midst of.
[time=881] He says, do all things without grumbling or disputing.
[time=887] We agreed most of us in the room did that when living in this land between the challenges, the trials, the heartache, the disappointment, the setbacks, the test results that weren't
[time=901] what you were hoping for.
[time=903] The financial turmoil that just seems to be overtaking you.
[time=909] The difficulty with children that leaves you feeling in over your head.
[time=917] We learned last week that all of this can foster.
[time=920] It can all cultivate a grumbling, complaining spirit.
[time=924] We saw this with the people of Israel as it related to the manna, as it related to the food that God had provided them.
[time=931] The food God had graciously provided them.
[time=934] This manna, this flaky, cakey, oatmealy, mush stuff that they
[time=940] were to eat and did eat for the most part, morning, noon and night.
[time=944] It fell every morning, every day.
[time=946] It was their diet, every night it was their dinner.
[time=949] They had gotten to a point where they were sick and tired of the manna.
[time=954] They began to cry out for meat, their complaining spirit grew.
[time=959] We saw them last week at this crescendo of this appointment and grumbling, yelling out to Moses, "Give us meat.
[time=966] Give us meat.
[time=967] We're tired.
[time=968] We're tired of the manna." And listen, the great danger, I want to just reiterate this
[time=976] before we move on this morning, the great danger of complaining that we identified last week, the deadly effect of allowing grumbling to set in is where over time the complaining
[time=991] spirit gets aimed, where over time if not corrected, the
[time=997] complaint gets directed.
[time=1002] Let me just remind you of this.
[time=1005] I'll remind you of it just by way of an illustration that probably most of us can identify with.
[time=1012] You see, at first the 16-year-old says, "At first the 16-year-old says to the mom or to the dad, 'Home at 11, are you kidding me?'
[time=1025] She or he says that to you or to me, 'Home at 11, nobody has to
[time=1031] be home at 11.
[time=1032] I'm the only one who has to be home at 11," they say, "Are you kidding me?" And you say, "No, be home at 11." And they say, "This isn't fair, this isn't right." And they say, somewhere, and then they say, "That's the dumbest rule ever." That's the dumbest rule ever, they say, "Home at 11." You see, at first, it's the dumbest rule ever, right?
[time=1061] But if that spirit of complaint is watered, if that complaining heart is allowed to grow, guess where that complaint
[time=1072] can begin to be aimed, not at the rule, but now at who, you.
[time=1080] When complaint goes unchecked, it's not the dumbest rule ever, no, now six months later, you're the dumbest parent ever.
[time=1091] It's the same thing, it's the exact same thing Israel did with God.
[time=1096] Oh, I hope you'll write this down, they moved from complaining about their condition to complaining against God.
[time=1106] Oh, how dangerous.
[time=1109] They moved from this manna is the dumbest thing ever to we were
[time=1117] better off in Egypt.
[time=1119] We were better off as slaves.
[time=1121] We were better off without you.
[time=1126] Now you're the dumbest God ever.
[time=1128] And before we continue on this morning to principle number two in the land between, let me leave you with this regarding a spirit of complaint.
[time=1137] If you're not careful, and every single one of you is susceptible to this.
[time=1144] There's not a one of you that won't at some point in time in the days to come wrestle with this spirit of grumbling or complaining
[time=1154] things not being the way you want it.
[time=1157] You pick the setting, listen.
[time=1161] If you're not careful, a complaining spirit will blind you.
[time=1165] It will blind you.
[time=1167] It will turn you into an absolute fool.
[time=1172] Let me explain this.
[time=1174] Here's what I mean.
[time=1175] 1120, you can look there.
[time=1176] I hope you've got your Bibles open this morning.
[time=1178] The numbers chapter 11, if you've got your iPad or your phone, however it is, you're viewing the Scriptures, you can see for it yourself.
[time=1187] In Numbers 1120, the people of Israel are quoted as actually saying, why did we ever leave Egypt?
[time=1195] No, no, I want you to hear this.
[time=1197] They actually said this.
[time=1198] Why did we ever leave Egypt?
[time=1202] We were better off as slaves than quickly.
[time=1204] I just want to give you some perspective.
[time=1206] Rick Raber, one of our elders, and I were talking about this last week, and I want to just make sure that you see this.
[time=1213] I know it might seem obvious, but you know what?
[time=1218] It certainly wasn't to them in light of where the complaint had taken them.
[time=1225] Listen to me.
[time=1226] They were tortured in Egypt.
[time=1233] Their daughters were raped in Egypt.
[time=1237] Their sons were beaten in Egypt.
[time=1242] Please, just remember, they were abused, they were killed, and brutalized into a humiliating, degrading, horrific existence in Egypt.
[time=1256] And you want to go back to Egypt.
[time=1261] Complaint.
[time=1262] Oh, it's powerful.
[time=1265] Complaint and grumbling.
[time=1266] Left unchecked will lead you over time to blindly say things,
[time=1274] think things, and do some of the stupidest, most dangerous things you could ever conceive of.
[time=1283] So you want to go back to Egypt.
[time=1285] What do we say last week?
[time=1291] We said, don't complain.
[time=1295] No, don't complain.
[time=1296] We said, newsflash.
[time=1298] Trust the God who delivered you from Egypt.
[time=1301] Trust the God who brought you out of darkness.
[time=1304] Trust the God whose love for you is everlasting.
[time=1307] Trust the God who gave you his only son.
[time=1310] Trust the God who has shown himself to you last week, last month, last year.
[time=1315] Most of your life may be to be faithful and good and gracious.
[time=1319] You don't want to go back to Egypt.
[time=1322] Do you?
[time=1325] Say it.
[time=1325] Say no.
[time=1327] No.
[time=1330] You don't really want it your way, do you?
[time=1334] You want it his way.
[time=1337] Yes, so please say yes.
[time=1339] Yeah.
[time=1342] It'll blind you.
[time=1343] Trust God.
[time=1345] Trust in the Lord.
[time=1346] We had this kind of our theme verse last week.
[time=1350] Some of you know it, and if you don't know it, it's OK.
[time=1353] But those of you that know it, let's just take a minute and just say it with me.
[time=1358] Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[time=1360] And lean not on your own understanding.
[time=1364] In all of your ways, acknowledge him, and he will make your path, what?
[time=1372] Straight.
[time=1373] Trust in the Lord with all your heart when traveling through the land between.
[time=1381] And he will make your paths straight.
[time=1383] Well, as we come to our land between principle number two this morning, I want us to turn the focus of our discussion away from the people of Israel.
[time=1394] And this morning we're actually going to look in on Moses himself and the harsh reality of what
[time=1401] is brewing and turning in his own heart and mind.
[time=1406] Going to look at Moses for a few minutes here.
[time=1408] All right, now, remember, question for you.
[time=1410] Did Moses want this leadership position from the beginning of this journey?
[time=1417] Did Moses raise this hand and say, oh, God, pick me.
[time=1422] I want to go to Pharaoh.
[time=1423] I want to lead these people.
[time=1424] Is that what Moses did?
[time=1425] Yes or no?
[time=1426] No.
[time=1427] And Moses wanted nothing to do with it.
[time=1429] Moses never wanted this spot.
[time=1431] He never wanted to be in this position.
[time=1433] But God brings them into this position.
[time=1436] And now he's in this position.
[time=1437] And now he's been through all he's been through.
[time=1439] And now he has tried to endure what has been a growing wave of complaint.
[time=1448] A growing wave of grumbling.
[time=1452] You know what that's like?
[time=1455] I do.
[time=1458] You know what that's like.
[time=1460] I've watched-- I feel like I'm picking on my kids here.
[time=1463] I'm not, because it's not my kids.
[time=1465] It's your kids.
[time=1465] It's all kids.
[time=1466] It's you.
[time=1466] When you were a kid, me, when I was a kid, we've all seen.
[time=1470] And I'm sort of making a light of this.
[time=1471] But it's truly true.
[time=1472] Haven't we all seen a complaining kid or two or three in one voice, in one unison?
[time=1479] Coming after a mom or a dad just completely unwind that parent?
[time=1482] Haven't you seen it?
[time=1484] Have you seen what complaining does when you listen to it all afternoon?
[time=1490] You're in the car.
[time=1491] You're at home.
[time=1492] You're at the drive-through.
[time=1493] And then after about three hours, you just snap.
[time=1497] And you scare them to death, right?
[time=1500] This is Moses.
[time=1507] He's at the end of his rope.
[time=1511] And they want meat, morning, noon, and night.
[time=1515] That's all he's hearing, how sick of it the people are, how they want meat, now they're tired of manna, patience, and their anger is only growing.
[time=1523] And so now we look at Moses this morning.
[time=1525] And how is he processing all of this?
[time=1529] How is Moses bearing up under all the pressures that one faces in the land between all that you decide?
[time=1537] I'll let you answer that question.
[time=1538] Look with me at Numbers 11.
[time=1541] We'll start at verse 10.
[time=1542] Now Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families.
[time=1546] Each man at the doorway of his tent.
[time=1548] And look at verse 11.
[time=1549] So Moses, here he goes, he goes over the edge.
[time=1552] So Moses said to the Lord, why have you been so hard on me?
[time=1557] Why have you been so hard on your servant?
[time=1560] And why have I not found favor in your sight that you have laid the burden of all this people on me?
[time=1568] Was it I who conceived all these people?
[time=1570] Was it I who brought them forth?
[time=1573] That you should say to me, carry them in your bosom as a nurse carries a nursing infant to the land which you swore to their fathers.
[time=1581] Where am I to get meat to give to all these people?
[time=1586] For they weep before me saying, give us meat that we may eat.
[time=1591] I alone, verse 14, here he goes.
[time=1593] I alone am not able to carry all this people because it is too burdensome for me.
[time=1601] My friends, he's done.
[time=1604] He has crashed.
[time=1606] And if you think somehow, meltdown is too strong of a word because that's exactly what we see here.
[time=1613] You see the land between is not just fertile soil for complaint.
[time=1616] It's also fertile soil for emotional meltdown, for deep personal discouragement.
[time=1623] And if you think meltdown is maybe too strong of a word, just keep reading.
[time=1626] Look at verse 15, I laugh, but it's not funny.
[time=1629] So if you are going to deal thus with me, please kill me at once.
[time=1636] If I have found favor in your sight, kill me, he says.
[time=1639] And do not let me see my wretchedness because I am going over the edge, God, and I'm tired of this.
[time=1646] I can't, I can't carry this any more.
[time=1651] It's too heavy.
[time=1654] It's too hard.
[time=1656] I can't do it.
[time=1658] I can't carry this any longer.
[time=1663] The weight of it is overwhelming.
[time=1665] The pressure of it is just suffocating.
[time=1667] And I keep having to deal with it day after day after day.
[time=1672] Mannion says in his book that Moses, that for Moses, this isn't at all like carrying a baby across the desert.
[time=1679] It's like carrying a tractor.
[time=1681] All friends listened to his voice this morning.
[time=1686] It's too heavy.
[time=1687] I can't carry this any more.
[time=1691] It's too heavy.
[time=1693] I can't do it.
[time=1696] Question for you, whose voice do you hear in that crime?
[time=1707] Wherever you find yourself today,
[time=1714] as you hear the cry of Moses, whose voice do you hear?
[time=1717] Honestly.
[time=1722] Let's be honest today.
[time=1724] Who do you hear?
[time=1726] I hear the voice of a couple.
[time=1731] A couple who I know, not as young anymore.
[time=1737] After 13 years of fertility and experimental treatments,
[time=1743] I hear the voice of a couple struggling and disappointed,
[time=1749] angry at times at God for what feels so unfair, so unloving, even, so confusing.
[time=1756] It's too heavy.
[time=1762] I can't carry this any more.
[time=1764] I hear the voice of a friend, a friend of mine, lost in addiction, crying out to me on a regular basis that it's too dark, it's too consuming, it's too strong.
[time=1780] I read Moses's cry, I hear his lament, and I hear the voice of a weary husband or wife tired.
[time=1789] At the end of their marital rope in what's been a 10, 15,
[time=1795] 20 year effort to salvage a marriage that maybe, maybe they feel like today just isn't gonna last.
[time=1804] It's too heavy.
[time=1809] I can't carry this anymore.
[time=1810] I read through my Bible, like many of you read through yours,
[time=1816] and as I read through my Bible, I'll come across from time to time this voice.
[time=1823] I absolutely will.
[time=1824] You can turn with me to the book of Psalms.
[time=1827] The book of Psalms is filled with examples of this very voice.
[time=1831] Psalm 13 is one place we could go here in the 13th Psalm.
[time=1837] We hear the psalmist, we hear King David's voice in this instance, and he says in 13 one, something that you may have said, something you may have felt.
[time=1847] Maybe this is something you've cried out before.
[time=1849] How long, oh Lord, will you forget me forever?
[time=1854] Are you listening?
[time=1856] Sometimes that's how we feel.
[time=1860] How long will you hide your face from me?
[time=1862] How long shall I take counsel in my own soul?
[time=1866] Having sorrow in my heart all the day.
[time=1869] How long will my enemy be exalted over me?
[time=1872] Consider and answer me.
[time=1875] Oh Lord, my God, please enlighten my eyes or I will sleep the sleep of what?
[time=1880] Say it, church.
[time=1881] You know that's how some feel, don't you?
[time=1889] You understand that that's
[time=1895] where the road of discouragement can actually take people?
[time=1900] God, please answer me.
[time=1906] God, please do something or maybe I should just die.
[time=1911] He goes on, my enemy will say I have overcome him.
[time=1919] Consider and answer me, oh Lord, I hear the voice of David, my friends, when I hear Moses and his words in Numbers 11, I hear David again in Psalm 55 at a time in his life when he was facing severe disappointment and sorrow.
[time=1935] It says in Psalm 55 verses one to six, it says, "Give ear to my prayer, O God, "and do not hide yourself from my supplication.
[time=1943] "Give heed to me and answer me.
[time=1946] "I am restless in my what?" Say it, complaint, see where this goes, and am surely distracted because of the voice of the enemy, because of the pressure of the wicked, for they bring down trouble upon me, and in anger, they bear a grudge against me.
[time=1962] He's losing ground quick.
[time=1964] Look what it says in verse four, "My heart is in anguish within me, "and the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
[time=1972] "Fear and trembling come upon me, "and horror has overwhelmed me." People, my friends, people really, truly on a daily basis, live here.
[time=1981] I said, "Oh, that I had wings.
[time=1987] "Oh, that I had wings like a dove,
[time=1993] "so I could fly away and be at rest."
[time=2006] Sometimes discouragement can strike at such a deep place.
[time=2011] Sometimes it can be so heavy and debilitating.
[time=2017] Sometimes you just want to fly away.
[time=2021] So I hear the voice of Moses in Numbers 11.
[time=2028] Quite honestly, there are days that it's my voice.
[time=2032] I hear.
[time=2036] Sometimes it's my own cry.
[time=2038] In those seasons of time, over 25 years of ministry,
[time=2047] when being upfront ends up being painful, when leading is actually very, very lonely,
[time=2058] times often when your weaknesses and failures
[time=2065] wind up on full display for all to see.
[time=2068] Being a pastor, leading in a ministry position
[time=2075] is a difficult endeavor, and so is being a surgeon, and so is being a teacher, and so is being a banker, or a factory worker, or a small business owner, or a mom.
[time=2085] I am not comparing myself to any of you this morning.
[time=2090] I'm not saying that my gig is harder than any of yours.
[time=2096] I'm simply, if it's allowed confiding in you this morning, that there are days when it all can feel like
[time=2107] it's just too heavy, can't carry it any longer.
[time=2111] And it's interesting in ministry.
[time=2117] It sort of happens progressively, and you'll, I think, understand this.
[time=2121] When you're in, watch this, when you're in ministry, in your 20s, you're convinced that someday everyone will like you, that everyone will someday approve of you, that there will be a time when they'll all think you're the greatest, 'cause at 26, you know you are, and there will be a day when they'll all just finally catch up, right, say amen, if you understand that.
[time=2147] Yeah, 20s, wow.
[time=2148] When you're in the ministry in your 30s,
[time=2154] 30s are interesting times.
[time=2157] When you're in ministry in your 30s, you're now convinced that those who don't like you, those who haven't come alongside, you're convinced they're all idiots.
[time=2169] And in your 30-something arrogance, which is a very real thing, we can talk about that later, in your 30-something arrogance, you try to convince yourself that you're better off without 'em.
[time=2180] Who cares, just move on?
[time=2182] You're king of the ship, you're ruling the road.
[time=2185] And then come your 40s.
[time=2189] When you're in ministry, when you're leading, in your 40s, something inside begins to shift.
[time=2198] It's like a light slowly gets turned on.
[time=2204] You can admit privately, usually not publicly, but you can admit privately or in rare transparent moments that maybe your critics might actually have a point.
[time=2217] You really do have significant flaws.
[time=2222] But usually in the 40s, you just keep pushing forward, hoping for that day, when you might still be able to win them all over, and if you're still in ministry in your, say it, 50s, it's hard to say sometimes.
[time=2240] If you're still in ministry in your 50s, which a lot of, which a lot of them aren't, but if you are still in ministry in your 50s, and you possess any capacity at all to still be honest, you know without question.
[time=2259] It has now become abundantly clear to those you work with
[time=2265] and those who know you best, that your weaknesses and your flaws are extremely real.
[time=2272] And that while the truth is you will never win them all over, you should with however many years you have left in great humility and with great vigilance, you should try to grow and make progress in your leadership and in your character, because by this time it's pretty clear, it needs it.
[time=2297] And I stand here this morning simply to say to all of you that there are times over the past 25, six, 27 years when the people I've hurt, when the hurt that people have caused me and my family when the disappointments and sorrows over, letting people down that you were trying to help losing people that felt like family, seeing more clearly than ever my own inadequacies.
[time=2327] There are times that feels overwhelming, times when you just wanna quit, days when you could swear, it's like you're trying to carry a tractor and the weight of leading can just crush you.
[time=2342] And I want you to know this morning, this is what Moses is experiencing.
[time=2350] This is the brokenness behind his cry.
[time=2354] And when I read this passage, when I come to Numbers 11 and I read through it and over it, day after day after day, as I have in recent days, when I hear his heart, when I understand as many of you in the room do as well, when you understand his cry, there's something in me that hopes God will meet him in this place of need.
[time=2385] What's God gonna do?
[time=2386] How's God going to respond?
[time=2390] Many of you here in the room, you know the desperation in his voice.
[time=2396] You've felt it as have I.
[time=2398] You understand the ache in his soul.
[time=2400] You've felt that as have I.
[time=2403] Now what will God do?
[time=2406] I say what will God do because you know as well as I know,
[time=2412] sometimes when we get to these places, what we hear is a lecture.
[time=2415] You know sometimes what we hear is suck it up.
[time=2418] What we hear sometimes is you should be better.
[time=2421] What we hear in some places is you should be stronger.
[time=2423] What we hear in some settings is what's your problem.
[time=2428] And there's something in me when I read Moses here
[time=2434] in Numbers 11, I just say, oh God, I hope that you'll meet him in this place.
[time=2441] And as the passage unfolds, oh how I love the word of God and how it unfolds.
[time=2448] As the passage unfolds, we come to verse 16 and 17 and it says, the Lord therefore said to Moses, gather for me 70 men from the elders of Israel whom you know to be the elders of the people and their officers, Moses, and bring them to the tent of meeting and let them take their stand there with you, just stop right there.
[time=2475] This is going in a good direction.
[time=2477] He says to Moses, go get 70 of your buds.
[time=2481] Go get 70 of your fellow workers.
[time=2483] Go get 70 men who like you care for these people.
[time=2487] And come to the tent of meeting.
[time=2489] The tent of meeting was this tent.
[time=2492] It was the tabernacle of God among the people of Israel as they traveled and it wasn't where you met with each other.
[time=2499] It's where you went to meet with who?
[time=2501] With God.
[time=2502] And he says, you're hurting and you're tired and you're weary.
[time=2508] And so go get 70 of your fellow elders and I want to meet with you.
[time=2515] Let's spend some time together.
[time=2518] And then I love what it says here.
[time=2520] It goes on in verse 17, then I will come down and speak with you there and I will take of the spirit.
[time=2529] I hope that's a capital S in your Bible.
[time=2533] It is in mind, do you know what this means?
[time=2535] This is the spirit of God.
[time=2537] I will take the spirit who is upon you and will put him, him, the spirit of God upon them.
[time=2547] And they shall, here it is, here's the language.
[time=2550] Look at it, they shall bear the burden of the people with you so that you will not bear it all alone.
[time=2559] Praise God.
[time=2563] I read that and something in me just goes, yes.
[time=2568] Thank you, God, for not lecturing him.
[time=2573] Thank you for meeting him in this place.
[time=2576] Thank you for your goodness.
[time=2582] Reminds me of Jesus and his words of grace and goodness and kindness.
[time=2587] And Matthew 11, one of my favorite verses of all time where Jesus himself says, all of you who are weary, come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden.
[time=2598] You know what the word phrase heavy laden means?
[time=2601] Burdened, can't carry it, I'm done.
[time=2605] He says, no, come to me.
[time=2609] Come to me, to my burdens, light, and I'll be with you.
[time=2614] What if God's still in the business, my friends,
[time=2622] and we're here this morning to proclaim that he is.
[time=2625] What if God is still in the business of taking away your burdens?
[time=2628] What if he really is still good and still gracious and still kind?
[time=2632] Your takeaway this morning is this,
[time=2638] and we're gonna come right back to this next week and we're gonna keep making our way through this land.
[time=2642] Would you just take your hands just for a moment?
[time=2644] You can put your bibles down, your pens down.
[time=2646] Would you just take a hand or both hands?
[time=2649] And would you just quietly, right there in front of you, don't even look around just, would you just look at your two hands?
[time=2654] Palms up, hands open.
[time=2656] You say, what was your application today?
[time=2660] What did you give the people to walk away with?
[time=2662] Here's what I'm giving you to walk away with.
[time=2664] Open up your hands.
[time=2666] Right now, hold them out in front of you and look at them.
[time=2670] And I want for each of you as you look at your hands to understand and see this posture of you receiving God's good and gracious and kind provision.
[time=2684] I'm not exactly sure what your land between looks like.
[time=2687] Not exactly sure what you're dealing with, what has you confused or hurting or scared.
[time=2693] But oh, would you please look at your hands right now, open, right in front of you?
[time=2699] This isn't weird, this isn't emotional, this is just very practical.
[time=2703] Now, now close them real quick, go fists.
[time=2706] Look at them, don't look at me, look at your fists now.
[time=2709] And as you look at your fists, understand this is how way too many times you and I approach the difficulties that we encounter because all of a sudden it's not going the way we thought it should, all of a sudden it's not moving in the direction that we would have called.
[time=2724] And I am begging you this morning to be a people who in the middle of the desert open up your hand, go ahead, just open them up, just leave them open now and just look at them.
[time=2733] Would you leave this place today?
[time=2736] Would you go to work tomorrow?
[time=2737] Would you parent your kids?
[time=2739] Would you go to school?
[time=2740] Would you go to the doctor?
[time=2742] Would you be with your father?
[time=2743] Would you do whatever it is God is asking you to do?
[time=2749] And would you keep your hands open?
[time=2752] Because here you go, the lamb between is not only fertile soil for complaint and the lamb between is not only fertile soil for meltdown, my friends, the lamb between is fertile soil for the provision of God in your life.
[time=2769] And you will never experience the provision of God with your fists up in the air.
[time=2777] You will only experience it with your palms wide open.
[time=2782] So go today and face tomorrow.
[time=2787] I hope they'll be open on Thursday and Friday and Saturday.
[time=2791] I can't wait to come back together again and see what else transpires.
[time=2799] What else God is up to in this lamb between, can't wait to see it, look at it, study it together.
[time=2806] We're so grateful for what He's teaching us and showing us.
[time=2809] We've got a couple of very land between-ish songs to sing and I hope you'll stand and I hope you'll sing and worship our God.
[time=2818] I hope you'll sing greatly.
[time=2820] Hope you'll fill this room with a voice of praise and thanks for the God who is walking you through this difficult place.
[time=2829] Let's sing together.
[time=2830] Would you stand?
[time=2831] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 70 seconds]
[time=2909] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 171 seconds]
[time=3090] - Thank you Lord.
[time=3092] (audience applauds) (upbeat music)
[time=3109] [MUSIC - 123 seconds]
[time=3249] All right, let's just name higher and higher.
[time=3251] You ready?
[time=3252] [MUSIC - 105 seconds]
[time=3362] - All right, think we got it this time.
[time=3370] We're gonna sing real loud this time together.
[time=3372] Gonna lift his name as high as we can.
[time=3374] You ready?
[time=3374] [MUSIC - 105 seconds]
[time=3486] (audience applauding)
[time=3494] - All right, God, we do.
[time=3495] We want to lift your name high this morning above anything else, above any information we have, above any programs that we have going on, above anything else, any initiatives, anything else we have, God, we want to lift your name high.
[time=3508] We want to lift your name high through your word.
[time=3512] We want to sing to you.
[time=3512] We want the truth of who you are and what you've done.
[time=3515] That to be the loudest thing that this church does.
[time=3519] God, we pray that we could just be used as very, very humble instruments to bring that to the world.
[time=3528] We thank you for an opportunity to do that, God.
[time=3531] It's a name we pray, amen.
[time=3557] (audience applauding)
