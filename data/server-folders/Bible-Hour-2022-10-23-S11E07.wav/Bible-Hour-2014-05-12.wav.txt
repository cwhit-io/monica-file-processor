[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, my name is Steve Webster, I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I'm so glad that you're watching, I'm so glad that you're with us, and that once again, you are part of our family.
[time=45] This morning is going to be a very, very exciting morning.
[time=49] There are two things I just want to catch you up on or introduce you to as you engage us this morning.
[time=55] The first is that this morning we're going to baptize several people, and baptism is an ancient ceremony that we celebrate as Christians.
[time=67] That is all the way traced back to even before Christ was born, but Christ Himself was baptized.
[time=73] We have two whole rooms in our church and this giant tub in our sanctuary for a reason.
[time=80] There are no unbaptized Christians in the New Testament.
[time=84] Baptism is one of the things that we do on a regular basis.
[time=88] Once people have professed their faith and their trust in Jesus Christ for their salvation, the Bible says that they're to be baptized as a public declaration of what God has already done.
[time=100] You're going to witness several of those this morning, and I cannot wait for you to hear their testimonies for you to celebrate with us as we celebrate people coming to know, not just know about, but know God through His Son, Jesus.
[time=115] There have been several of us rotating in the pulpit over the last few weeks, as you've noticed.
[time=120] This morning you're going to hear from Rod Ovid, a good friend of mine.
[time=123] Rod has been on the Bible hour several times before you know him as the founder and director of the Logos Biblical Institute with sites all over the area.
[time=132] There's information that's going to be on the screen right now about Logos, websites, information to contact them.
[time=140] I know that Rod and Carolyn would love for you to jump in and to be a part of the Logos Institute at your earliest convenience.
[time=148] They're doing great work. Rod has a strong and firm commitment to making sure the church knows what it believes.
[time=155] And they've been offering high quality college level Bible education for years at Logos, and I would love for you to be a part of that at your earliest convenience.
[time=165] So again, there's the website information on the screen and their contact info, so please reach out to them.
[time=171] I know that you'll be encouraged by that, and I know this morning you'll be encouraged by what Rod has to share with us from the Word of God in 1 Timothy 4.
[time=179] As always, please reach out to us. Please call us and contact us and let us know how you're being encouraged by the broadcast and how we can pray for you, how we can support you in whatever way that we can.
[time=190] Thank you, thank you for watching the Bible Hour and for being a part of our family. Have a great week.
[time=220] [MUSIC - 222 seconds]
[time=456] This morning, we're going to welcome some people into the water, Jessica. Come on down.
[time=462] Yes. Everyone say hi, Jessica. There she is. Okay.
[time=474] Jessica, tell us your story, Rokk. Tell us about what Christ has done in your life.
[time=478] Well, Christ has done amazing things in my life. Today, I stand before you on bend and knees. Today, I stand before you with my hands lifted to the sky.
[time=494] In my life, I have felt loss. I have felt pain. I have felt the loneliness and abandonment beyond what words can speak.
[time=505] First was the loss of my mother to cancer when I was 16. She was beautiful. She was strong.
[time=515] She was a God-fearing woman that taught me to be the woman that I am today.
[time=521] She displayed her faith and her love for our Lord for all to see. I miss her every minute of every day.
[time=531] Next was the pain of losing my father, which was when I was 22.
[time=537] He suffered after our mother's death and eventually ended his life.
[time=542] But the years that he was here, he displayed at times how a man of God should be.
[time=550] Finally, the abandonment and loneliness in my divorce.
[time=556] I was married for four years. I had two awesome little boys. My husband decided to leave our family.
[time=567] And I have never felt so fearful and scared in my life.
[time=573] I was a stay-at-home mom with a four-year-old and a six-month-old with no job, no car, and soon no home for us.
[time=584] My story leads me to today. God has opened up my eyes and my heart.
[time=592] This happened when I was 20 as I sat in church. This was the first time that I felt that I was never alone.
[time=600] I never understood why my parents took us to church every Sunday, but today I know that they did so that I know where I would have to go to go home.
[time=611] I fought many times for many years, but he has continued to put on my heart that he has not done with me yet
[time=619] and that he has something planned for me and my children.
[time=624] I know that there is no other home except for in the arms of our Lord.
[time=630] I know that there is no other home than for me here at Black Hawk.
[time=636] The Holy Spirit led me to Black Hawk seven years ago.
[time=640] Many of you have helped me walk through the pain and the abandonment on the days where I could bear to stand at anymore.
[time=648] You have given me the strength to continue to walk when I could not stand.
[time=654] You have been my shoulder to cry on when I did not know how I was going to make it through another day.
[time=661] And God has placed every individual in our lives for a reason which has only caused my faith to grow.
[time=669] I am thankful.
[time=672] I am thankful for the relationship with Jesus.
[time=676] That even through all my loss and pain I have been adopted and redeemed.
[time=683] I am loved, that on my loneliest of days Jesus has walked with me.
[time=696] He hears my prayers when nobody else is listening.
[time=700] His timing is perfect and through that he is giving me the patience through his grace.
[time=707] It is set in Psalms 16-8. I know the Lord is always with me.
[time=713] I will not be shaken for he is by my side.
[time=720] Jesus has been my best friend, my constant companion, my husband, my family and most importantly my Savior.
[time=729] I am grateful.
[time=733] I am grateful that God has worked in my life in mysterious ways.
[time=738] I know my journey is far from over but I am not afraid.
[time=743] I know that I am human and I am a sinner but I have been rescued through my faith in Jesus.
[time=751] My heart is full knowing that God has brought me through these experiences
[time=761] because he loved me enough to use my story in order to prove his redemptive work and grace.
[time=772] So I will pray every day that he continues to challenge me in order to change me so that I may grow closer to him.
[time=785] So today I not only stand on bended knees with my hands lifted to the sky.
[time=790] I stand before you with my eyes wide and my heart open.
[time=796] Today I am blessed. I am blessed to share and stand before you praising our Lord Jesus for allowing me to have a relationship with God through his suffering death resurrection
[time=809] so that I can sit in the kingdom of heaven and finally have a family again.
[time=814] [APPLAUSE]
[time=825] She sent me that story in an email a couple days ago and said, "Is this okay?" I said, "Yeah, Jessica, it's okay. It's great.
[time=835] I have no questions for you. I rejoice with you. My sister and what God has done in that Christ will never leave you or forsake you."
[time=843] So, here we go. This way. Turn around this way. Here we go. No plug your nose. Okay.
[time=849] By virtue of your profession of faith, my sister gives me great joy to baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=859] [APPLAUSE]
[time=869] This is Kathy and Jody and they're going to tell you their stories this morning. Kathy will let you go first. Tell us your story, Kathy, about what Christ has done in your life.
[time=880] Thank you. My name is Kathy Waugh. I'm married to Jody Waugh. We have four daughters and 13 grandchildren. They are five through 20 years old.
[time=890] I don't work outside the home. I take care of my five-year-old granddaughter occasionally who gives me so much joy.
[time=897] My interests are interior decorating, various crafts, gardening, and word games.
[time=902] I was raised in the Catholic Church and was blessed with a wonderful mother who shaped my life with her love and strong Christian beliefs.
[time=910] I have come to realize my faith is very strong and I have a need to be part of a family of believers like those in this church.
[time=918] It has been recently that I have surrendered my heart totally to Christ.
[time=923] I feel the events that led up to this was when Jody and I experienced the loss of his job after 12 years with the help of family and close friends, and most of all God, we were able to survive.
[time=937] Jody was blessed to find another job. Then six months later he was in a horrifying car accident. It was by the grace of God he lived.
[time=946] Before I knew if he was alive or not, since this happened an hour outside of Fort Wayne, I prayed with my close friend who was a neighbor at the time.
[time=957] I knew no matter what, I would be okay and God would take care of me.
[time=962] I prayed to have the strength to do what God expects of me and if I fail to bake his forgiveness always.
[time=969] Yes, yes. Thank you, Kathy. Thank you. With that right here, right here, that's fine. Kathy, come on this way. There you go.
[time=976] Kathy, who are you trusting in for your salvation today? Oh, Jesus. Oh, praise God. Praise God.
[time=982] By virtue, Kathy, of that profession, I'll just get in here real quick. There we go.
[time=986] By virtue of that profession of faith, let's go this way a little bit.
[time=989] By virtue of that profession of faith, Kathy, it gives me great joy to baptize you, my sister, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=998] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1009] This is Jody, everybody. Say hi, Jody. Okay. Tell us your story, Jody.
[time=1014] I don't know where to start. I was raised in the Baptist Church in Arkansas. Don't hold that against me, though.
[time=1024] And I had met my wife and my mother and my dad kind of grew up kind of not knowing what religion I was going to be.
[time=1035] My dad was Pentecostal and my mother was Baptist. So I didn't know which religion I was, so I followed the Baptist faith.
[time=1045] And I got baptized when I was 10 years old, really didn't know what baptism was, but I knew I was going to get in the water and get to go swimming.
[time=1053] So I really didn't know at that point. So I grew up kind of lost. I mean, I like going to church and singing and rejoicing, but I really didn't know what it was all about.
[time=1066] So as a teenager and a young adult, I kind of grew away from the Lord and kind of went in my own ways and thinking I was smarter.
[time=1074] So, you know, that happens to a lot of us. So at age 18, I decided I was going to go on the road with my music.
[time=1083] And I went and toured California and Vegas for three years with my music.
[time=1088] And once again, wavered away from the Lord so so bad that the Lord decided he was going to slap me on the hand this time and say, come back where you belong.
[time=1101] So at age 21, I OD'd and put myself in a drug rehab for six months.
[time=1108] And at that point, I'm now 54 and I was 21 at that time and I hadn't touched a drug or alcohol since.
[time=1116] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1119] Thank you.
[time=1120] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1123] And once again, at that point, I was worshiping the Lord, writing music, and then once again, wavered away.
[time=1130] I met my wife at age 27.
[time=1134] And at that point, again, two different religions.
[time=1139] My wife was raised Catholic. Once again, I was Baptist.
[time=1143] So we couldn't figure out what church we wanted to go to and which one we wanted to belong to.
[time=1149] So once again, we decided not to go.
[time=1152] So again, we wavered away until August of last year, 2013.
[time=1161] Like my wife said, I was in a horrific accident and I wasn't supposed to get out of it.
[time=1168] But by the grace of God, he pulled me out and I realized at that point, you've had two near life experiences where you could have lost your life.
[time=1180] And he brought you back both times.
[time=1182] And this time, you need to pay him back for what you did, for what he did for you.
[time=1188] So I have now given my life to the Lord, realized what he wanted me to do.
[time=1193] He wanted me to get back to my music and write songs for him.
[time=1197] So now I am writing songs for the Lord and I hope someday I get to share them with you guys.
[time=1204] And I am now blessed. My wife, my daughter, are here today also being baptized in the name of the Lord.
[time=1213] And we are very grateful for this church and I am very, very blessed because the Lord has accepted me back in his arms.
[time=1223] And I will never wave her again. Thank you.
[time=1226] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1234] Jodi, who are you trusting in for your salvation this morning?
[time=1236] The Lord.
[time=1238] Jodi, by virtue of your profession of faith, my brother, and by virtue of God's mercy and grace, shut abroad in your life.
[time=1248] I am overjoyed this morning to baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1255] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1261] Here you go.
[time=1263] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1267] Andrea is Jodi and Kathy's daughter. It's all in the family this morning.
[time=1273] Here we go.
[time=1275] Andrea, once you tell us your story, tell us what God has done in your life.
[time=1281] My name is Andrea Bear.
[time=1283] I'm sure.
[time=1284] There we go.
[time=1285] I have three children, one son and two daughters.
[time=1288] I work in as an operations associate at BAE Systems here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1294] My favorite thing to do is spend time with my kids, play games with my family, listen to music and cook.
[time=1301] I'm also a full-time college student working on my bachelor's degree in business administration.
[time=1307] And I'm pretty sure I'll work on my master's degree after that.
[time=1311] Growing up as a child, I always believed in God, although we didn't regularly attend church.
[time=1318] As an adult, I also haven't taken my belief in God as serious as I should have.
[time=1324] Although I've prayed with my kids and answered questions about God to the best of my ability, church attendance was sporadic and sadly, I feel that our life wasn't completely centered around God.
[time=1336] My children are 18, 15 and 5.
[time=1340] About two and a half years ago, I wanted to find a preschool for my five-year-old who was three at the time.
[time=1347] On the way home from work one day, I drove by Black Hawk Christian and wondered to myself,
[time=1353] I wonder if they have a preschool there.
[time=1355] I called and inquired about it, and a week later, she started to attend.
[time=1360] Last year, she started to come home from school, so excited to tell me what she had learned that day,
[time=1367] and most of it was about God.
[time=1369] She was so interested and often wanted me to elaborate.
[time=1373] Oftentimes, I found myself calling my mom or googling to help me answer her correctly.
[time=1380] That's when it really hit me that becoming more proactive in the church was imperative.
[time=1386] I wanted to show her the path to take and be able to answer her questions myself and have it come from my heart instead of somewhere else.
[time=1395] The past few years of my life has been a roller coaster ride with dramatic ups and downs
[time=1401] resulting in some pretty severe depression and anxiety.
[time=1406] I remember leaving the first service here that I attended, and I felt so different.
[time=1412] I loved feeling so calm, and for the first time in a very, very long time, I felt optimistic.
[time=1420] Focusing on my faith in God has helped me drastically over this past year.
[time=1425] I believe it has helped me be a better mom, a better daughter, and a better friend.
[time=1430] Feelings of hopelessness and despair seem to come a lot less frequently now,
[time=1436] and in general, I'm a much happier person.
[time=1439] And I attribute this to the unconditional love that God has for me.
[time=1443] I know he's led me to Black Hawk Christian for a reason, and that reason was to bring my family and I closer to him.
[time=1450] I couldn't be more excited to be baptized and to vote myself wholeheartedly to Christ, my Savior, and Lord today.
[time=1457] And I'm thrilled to take this journey with him by my side, teaching me, guiding me, and loving me.
[time=1462] [AMEN] (Applause) You want to plug your nose?
[time=1471] No.
[time=1472] Okay.
[time=1473] I don't get more joy from this.
[time=1476] I don't get more joy from anything else than this.
[time=1479] To hear what God has done, you guys, it doesn't get any better.
[time=1482] Andrea, by virtue of your profession of faith in Jesus, it gives me great joy this morning to baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1491] (Applause)
[time=1505] Let's pray together.
[time=1508] God, I'm not just praying right now because it's a transition to something else,
[time=1516] but I think we just need to stop and marvel at what you've done,
[time=1522] God, what you are doing.
[time=1524] Young and old this morning, God, kids for service, adults for service,
[time=1530] professing their faith in your son Jesus, declaring that there is no other way to be saved but by him.
[time=1538] Agreeing with you about yourself, agreeing with you about themselves, God,
[time=1545] what a beautiful thing.
[time=1547] Thank you for your grace and mercy that you've shown.
[time=1550] Each person in this water this morning, myself, very much included.
[time=1554] God, thank you for today.
[time=1555] Thank you for the chance we have God to remember in communion, the body and blood of your son Jesus.
[time=1562] Thank you for the stories that we just heard this morning of celebration that what he has done in our lives.
[time=1568] It is good, God.
[time=1570] It is good.
[time=1571] I would pray again right now this very moment that if there's anyone in this room that has not been baptized, that you would give them the strength and the courage to follow through with that active obedience and to give us the opportunity to rejoice with them.
[time=1586] Proud of these things, Heavenly Father, with great thanksgiving today.
[time=1590] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1594] Well, this morning, Rod Ovid is coming to open the word with us.
[time=1599] Rod is a dear friend.
[time=1601] He's currently serving as the pastor at a new church in Decatur called Word of God Community Church.
[time=1606] They meet at Belmont Middle School on Sunday mornings.
[time=1609] Rod told me this morning that they just gave him a building.
[time=1612] So I guess if you're Rod Ovid, they give you buildings.
[time=1614] And that's a great blessing to them.
[time=1616] Rod and Carolyn have been at Blackhawk for over 12 years.
[time=1619] They've led Wednesday midweek services.
[time=1621] They've led Sunday school classes.
[time=1623] You know Rod and Carolyn best though because of the Lagos Institute of Biblical Studies.
[time=1629] I have not met anyone, but that's a strong statement.
[time=1633] So I'll just be careful.
[time=1634] It's true.
[time=1635] I haven't met anyone that has a greater passion for the Church of God
[time=1641] to be educated than Rod Ovid.
[time=1644] I saw it this week when I met with him.
[time=1646] Rod is a tremendous encouragement to me, to this place.
[time=1650] Rod has been looking forward this morning for a very, very, very long time.
[time=1654] On Wednesday evenings at six and seven thirty here at Blackhawk, Rod facilitates the Lagos Biblical Institute.
[time=1662] Six and seven thirty.
[time=1663] There's information in the lobby in one of the window displays out there.
[time=1666] Please find Rod after the services and ask him questions.
[time=1668] He would be happy to meet you there.
[time=1671] Rod's a member of our teaching team in this time of transition and a urine for a treat this morning.
[time=1676] As Rod opens up to us, first empty chapter four.
[time=1678] Would you please this morning welcome friends, my dear friend, and ours Rod Ovid.
[time=1683] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1690] Thank you Steve.
[time=1693] I tell you, I was really blessed by the testimonies.
[time=1697] The baptism testimonies are always, always rich.
[time=1703] Why?
[time=1704] Because they're personal.
[time=1706] Because we get to see where God intersects with real life.
[time=1712] We learned some of that in the New Testament as well.
[time=1715] And this morning we're going to look at first Timothy 4, one through ten.
[time=1721] We're going to read it together so if you'll stand with me as I read these ten verses, we'll stand together in honor of the Lord's Word.
[time=1732] The Spirit clearly says that in latter time some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.
[time=1742] Such teachings come through hypocritical liars whose consciences have been seared
[time=1748] as with a hot iron.
[time=1750] They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth.
[time=1762] For everything God created is good and nothing is to be rejected is received with thanksgiving because it is consecrated by the Word of God and prayer.
[time=1775] If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, brought up in the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.
[time=1785] Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales.
[time=1789] Rather train yourself to be godly.
[time=1793] For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things,
[time=1800] holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.
[time=1805] This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance, and for this we labor and strife, that we have put our hope in the living God
[time=1817] who is the savior of all men and especially of those who believe.
[time=1823] Let's pray.
[time=1824] Father, I just ask that you would let these scriptures sink down into our soul
[time=1831] that your Holy Spirit at this time will teach us.
[time=1835] That you will open that spirit that has been born of you and pour into us what it is we need to hear this morning.
[time=1844] I thank you for this time and ask Father that we will go out of here rejoicing.
[time=1850] Now bless us as we learn in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1856] You may be seated.
[time=1858] Now it's an interesting passage that we have here in front of us,
[time=1866] and there's some words that perhaps strike you a little odd.
[time=1871] It strikes many people odd in this 21st century America where we're so pragmatic and intellectual, and we just are so mature and so sophisticated.
[time=1884] So when we come into a scripture that talks about demons, we wonder, we scratch our heads, perhaps some laugh.
[time=1897] But Paul is giving a clarion warning here to each and every one of us.
[time=1903] He says the Spirit clearly says that in the latter times, and that is now by the way, that euphemism latter times applies now,
[time=1914] everything from Christ through now.
[time=1917] We're in the latter times, not to be mistaken as the last days.
[time=1922] All right, we're in those latter times.
[time=1927] And he says some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.
[time=1936] He's writing Timothy, and what's interesting about this, Timothy is his protege.
[time=1943] And he'll be leaving Timothy behind a shepherd, a very important flock that was found in Ephesus, which is modern-day Turkey,
[time=1953] but he left them there to shepherd in Ephesus.
[time=1959] Paul spent over three years there working in that city, and the area is known for its darkness.
[time=1968] It was Las Vegas.
[time=1971] It was darkness.
[time=1976] It was evil.
[time=1979] By its very essence, it was that way, and we'll talk about that.
[time=1985] In Ephesus, they worshiped all sorts of gods,
[time=1992] and they were known for their dark arts and their magic and their witchcraft
[time=1998] and idol worship of all kinds.
[time=2003] They had practices, they were very superstitious, and it was very common in Ephesus that if you didn't like someone, you could curse them.
[time=2013] If you had competition and you wanted an edge in the marketplace, you could buy what they called an Ephesian letter, not to be mixed up with our Ephesians letter.
[time=2024] But you could buy this little block of wood that on it would be carved on brass, a curse.
[time=2030] They believed in amulets.
[time=2032] They believed in Artemis, the goddess, there in the temple in Ephesus, who later became Diana, and she was the god of fertility.
[time=2041] They believed that by going to these gods, the childless could have children.
[time=2047] You could be healed.
[time=2048] All kinds of things would happen.
[time=2052] And they leaned heavily on the stars and superstition of all types.
[time=2058] And it was very dark.
[time=2062] And it's interesting, the way Paul writes, usually in many of his books, he does what we call he hinges the book.
[time=2071] We see that in Ephesians.
[time=2072] The first half is doctrine, the second half is application.
[time=2076] And basically that's what we have here in chapter four.
[time=2080] He has spent time telling you about elders.
[time=2086] He has told us about their qualifications.
[time=2089] And one thing in particular with the elders is they should be apt to teach, able to teach.
[time=2095] And in fact, he starts off with Timothy telling him to study to show himself approved unto God, a workman that needs not be ashamed.
[time=2106] And so he says, "There will be those in your mists that will be elders, and they need to watch the gate.
[time=2114] They need to be spiritually attuned.
[time=2116] They need to be in to the Word of God."
[time=2122] And so he talks about these qualifications.
[time=2125] And right here, as he gets into chapter four, we hinge it, and now he's in practical application.
[time=2132] He's saying, "Hey, there is infiltration in our mists."
[time=2138] And elders step up and watch for wolves.
[time=2145] Now, Paul wasn't the only one saying this.
[time=2149] There were others.
[time=2151] In fact, it started with Jesus.
[time=2153] We see this in Matthew 24 verses 4 through 5.
[time=2160] Paul was answered, "Watch out that no one deceives you, for many will come in my name, claiming that I am Christ, and will deceive many." He said that around 32, A.D.
[time=2172] Paul issued a stern warning as early as 55 A.D.
[time=2176] in his letter to the Corinthians.
[time=2178] He says, "But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.
[time=2189] For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached,
[time=2195] or if you receive a different spirit from the spirit that you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough." And his tongue was right about there in his cheek when he said that.
[time=2210] We read in Acts 20 that around 56 A.D., Paul was ending his missionary journey
[time=2216] and he spoke to those in Ephesus.
[time=2218] And he says, "I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock." And again in around 62 A.D., Paul writes these same Ephesians and he says, "Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves,
[time=2238] and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.
[time=2245] Instead speaking the truth in love, we will, and all things grow up into him who is the head that is Christ." And later in the mid 60s or late 60s, Peter joined in in his letter.
[time=2261] But there were false prophets among the people.
[time=2265] Just as there would be false teachers among you, they will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them, bringing swift destruction on themselves.
[time=2280] And again in 64 A.D., Jude writes this, "For certain men whose condemnation was written about long ago, have secretly slipped in among you. These are godless men who change the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only sovereign and Lord." And then of course Paul is mentioning it here in 1 Timothy, and that's in about the year 66.
[time=2310] The point I'd like to make is that this was an ongoing problem.
[time=2315] It didn't just happen one time. We hear about it when Jesus was there.
[time=2319] We hear about it through the whole 1st century.
[time=2322] In fact, John at the end of the 1st century, in about 94 or 5, he says this, "Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world." So we see this warning throughout.
[time=2347] I like Timothy. I like the book of 1st and 2nd Timothy.
[time=2351] I find it difficult to read sometimes, because I understand it as the last things Paul wrote.
[time=2361] In fact, the sadness of 2 Timothy when he says, "Look, I fought a good fight. I know my time is up."
[time=2372] And I ask myself many times, what would I write if it was my last letter?
[time=2377] If I had to write my brothers and sisters, what would I say?
[time=2381] What warning would I give?
[time=2385] I think of John, the last man standing, in Ephesus as well,
[time=2393] writing his words, "Dear children, dear beloved ones of God."
[time=2399] And the very last word John writes is "Keep yourself from idolon,
[time=2406] from idols. Keep yourself from anything that comes between you and takes place of God."
[time=2417] So we read these last writings of Paul.
[time=2422] He's fought the good fight, and he says, "Guys, brothers, sisters, they're still going to be fighting." In your church career, people will come in among you.
[time=2435] And he gives some of the credit to Satan, to demons.
[time=2440] And again, in our culture today, if that it seems through relativism and pseudo-intellectual rantings,
[time=2449] much of the church has been dumbed down.
[time=2452] We know from Lagos that the biblical understanding of him is at an all-time low.
[time=2460] People don't know if Daniel's in the New Testament or Old Testament.
[time=2465] People don't know what it says about their salvation, how to live a Christian life.
[time=2471] They just go to church and want to feel good.
[time=2477] We come here to learn.
[time=2482] And Paul, in his love for the church in this last letter,
[time=2490] says, "I want you to know that Satan is alive and well."
[time=2499] And believe it or not, he's behind much of what's going on.
[time=2502] Between the media, academia, and Hollywood, Christians have been maligned, accused of being intolerant and naive.
[time=2511] So much so that we have been shamed by our knowledge of the truth,
[time=2517] and that very truth has been marginalized and relegated to narrow-minded opinions.
[time=2526] And we need to stand up and say no.
[time=2530] There is a God.
[time=2533] And this God chose to communicate.
[time=2537] And he has communicated to mankind through what we call the Bible.
[time=2543] And we need to hear what it says in his Word.
[time=2548] We need it now more than ever.
[time=2554] Paul talks about a spiritual battle going on to those very same people and Ephesians.
[time=2559] He wrote this, "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of the dark world, and against spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms."
[time=2577] Now for those of us today in America might be a little hard to grasp.
[time=2583] But first we need to look at the environment that Paul was working in.
[time=2588] There in Epheses, as I mentioned, they had all of that evil around them.
[time=2593] They had spiritual evil everywhere woven into the fabric of their everyday life.
[time=2600] Magic and superstition they thought were their ways of acquiring hope.
[time=2605] Help in a sense of security to the populace, these formulas, and tokens were guaranteed to bring protection on journeys, success and love or business.
[time=2618] Children to the childless.
[time=2621] They had love potions one through nine. They had all types of stuff there.
[time=2629] So much so that when Paul made an impact and God got into the very hearts of men and women in Epheses,
[time=2636] a very, very monumental thing happened.
[time=2641] We read this in the books of Acts chapter 9.
[time=2645] When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Epheses, they were all seized with fear.
[time=2652] And the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor.
[time=2657] Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed their evil deeds.
[time=2662] A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly.
[time=2669] When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to 50,000 drachmas.
[time=2677] In this way, the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.
[time=2683] 50,000 drachmas, that was five million dollars.
[time=2693] That's a big pile of scrolls, amulets, tokens, five million dollars of garbage that was running their lives,
[time=2713] consuming them, a chain about their neck, and they put it in the middle and they burned it.
[time=2724] A famous Greek philosopher, Heraclitus, he was a native of Ephesus.
[time=2729] He was known as the weeping philosopher.
[time=2732] He wrote that the reason such melancholy had much to do with the atmosphere, the temple of Artemis in Ephesus.
[time=2740] Heraclitus said that the darkness within the temple altar was the darkness of vileness.
[time=2747] He stated that the morals of the temple were worse than the morals of beasts and that the inhabitants of Ephesus were fit only to be drowned.
[time=2757] And that the reason he could never smile was that he lived in the midst of such terrible uncleanness.
[time=2764] But what about today?
[time=2767] See, Satan likes to beguile us.
[time=2771] He is the master of reasonableness, as he would think.
[time=2778] He's a master of disguise, he's in fact the angel of light.
[time=2786] Just as Satan can masquerade as an angel of light, demonic teachings have a reasonable and attractive appearance.
[time=2793] The substance, Eve, saw that the tree was beautiful.
[time=2798] The fruit looked delicious and she wanted wisdom that it could give her.
[time=2804] So why not?
[time=2807] She was deceived by Satan and sin was the result.
[time=2812] So Paul warns the Corinthian church, "I fear that somehow your pure and undivided devotion to Christ will be corrupted just as Eve."
[time=2822] Was deceived by the cunning ways of the serpent.
[time=2830] We find out that the demons can torment.
[time=2836] It says so in the New Testament.
[time=2839] It says that they can torment us.
[time=2842] Ochaleo is the word used there.
[time=2844] And that word means to harass, disturb, agitate, trouble, the mind and emotions.
[time=2851] Now we're not talking about possession, we're talking about minor little influences and you endos.
[time=2859] I think every one of us can attest to we have been minding our own business sitting there and then all of a sudden the thought comes out of nowhere.
[time=2869] And you go, "Where did that ugliness come from?" Now you can have some social scientists talk about it, you can have people look up the brain and talk about the synapse
[time=2880] and the different electrical current and everything that goes on the brain.
[time=2885] But people, we are, as C.S. Lewis put it, "We are spirits living in a body."
[time=2897] Every one of us as believers in Christ have been reconnected in our spirit to God.
[time=2904] We are spirit beings.
[time=2907] I don't know how it happens.
[time=2911] But Satan in charge of this world is able to blow in our ear every once in a while and we need to be on our best watch.
[time=2923] We get caught up in our own pride, we get caught up in our own lackadaisical attitudes and before we know it, we've been shocked.
[time=2932] And that's why in the book to Ephesians Paul says, "Put on the full armor of God."
[time=2939] Because see, Satan, for us in the United States, he's very sly.
[time=2944] If he was to sit there and to stand up in all his ugliness and scare us, there'd be a million people down here having a prayer meeting.
[time=2952] We'd all be on our knees.
[time=2955] But rather, especially at this time of year, we just paint it up and we laugh about Halloween and we laugh at all the little monsters and we laugh at all the spirit world.
[time=2967] And he laughs all the way to the bank.
[time=2972] The spirit world is real and we need to be on our guard.
[time=2980] He likes to shoot from afar. That's why Peter says, "Be alert and of sober mind your enemy, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone that devours."
[time=2991] But Paul says, "Look, you need that shield of faith because of the fiery darts and arrows that the enemy will shoot."
[time=2999] See, he can do that from afar off.
[time=3003] He doesn't have to be up close and personal.
[time=3006] When you're not looking, you will get that arrow and we need to be full of faith.
[time=3014] We need to have our breastplate of righteousness intact.
[time=3019] Or we will say, "I didn't see that coming." Elbert Barnes wrote this, "A man who has to contend with a visible enemy may feel safe if he only prepares to meet him in the open field.
[time=3034] But far different is the case if the enemy is invisible.
[time=3038] If he steals upon us slyly and stealthily, if he practices war only by ambushes and by surprises, such is the foe that we have to contend with.
[time=3050] And almost all Christian struggle is warfare against stratagems and wilds."
[time=3056] Satan does not openly appear. He approaches us not in repulsive forms but comes to recommend some plausible doctrine to lay before us, some temptation that shall not immediately repel us.
[time=3069] He presents the world in an alluring aspect, invites us to pleasures that seem to be harmless, and leads us in indulgence until we have gone so far that we cannot retreat.
[time=3084] And that's why Paul, in this very passage near the end, talks about the gymnasium.
[time=3094] He says, "You need to skip godless myths and old wives' tales."
[time=3101] Plenty of those around. Rather, train yourself to be godly and he kicks into an athletic metaphor.
[time=3109] For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things.
[time=3117] What he's saying is, "Timothy, I know you like to go to the gymnasium, but you need some spiritual exercise as well."
[time=3128] In Ephesus, there were four big gymnasiums, over 80,000 square feet of pools and saunas and equipment, and they had all kinds of grounds.
[time=3138] They took over two acres. You could go and run. They had walking trails. They had all this stuff.
[time=3143] So people, by the time Jesus and Paul were around the average Greek citizen by the age of 12 spent more time worrying about their body than their brain.
[time=3155] Sounds familiar. And Paul is saying, "Look, I know you like to go to the gym and see we know from history that elders of the synagogue and elders in the church were very welcome in these gymnasiums, and they held a high esteem there.
[time=3173] And so the temptation is to go take care of the body." And he says to Timothy, "Look, I know you're a young man, and I know you like to impress the people.
[time=3183] I know you've got to have the guns. I know you just really want to look good, but you better train your body."
[time=3190] And he uses the word "Ucebia." "You better train your body so you will walk worthy."
[time=3198] "Ucebia" means you are built up to be worthy.
[time=3203] You are ready for the foe. You are ready for the wrestling match. We wrestle not.
[time=3210] In the days that Paul was writing in the Olympics, in those games, if you lost your wrestling match, they gouged your eyes out.
[time=3220] There was a lot at stake. And he says, "We don't wrestle with flesh and blood. We wrestle with something more insidious.
[time=3229] We wrestle with the evil one. And there's more at stake than our eyes."
[time=3236] So we need to get busy.
[time=3241] So Paul says, "Timothy, go to the gym if you must, but make sure you exercise your soul."
[time=3251] And then he closes by saying this. He says that this is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance.
[time=3262] And I want to close with this. This is the fourth time he's used that phraseology. This is a trustworthy saying.
[time=3268] So it begs the question, what is a trustworthy saying? It's this.
[time=3274] We put our hope in the living God who is the savior of all men, especially those who believe.
[time=3283] There was so much competition in the day of Paul in Ephesus. They had a temple to the Caesar.
[time=3290] And they claimed Caesar was God. On the coins it would say, "No man comes to the Father but by me." Does that sound familiar? It was on Roman coins.
[time=3303] They worshiped the Caesar as the savior of the world. And Jesus said, "No, I am the savior of the world."
[time=3312] And today we have to ask ourselves, what is our salvation?
[time=3319] What is our savior? When the lights are out and we're all alone, what is it we bank on?
[time=3326] What is it we lean on? Are we listening to the world? Are we going to the secular gym all the time?
[time=3337] Are we busy with secular things all the time to the exclusion of God's word?
[time=3344] He says, "We strive and labor for this and have put our hope in the living God who is the savior of all men, all men, but most importantly to those of us that have chose to believe."
[time=3358] So I ask two questions. Have you chosen to believe? Do you know Christ is your savior? That's question number one.
[time=3367] Number two, if you have, are we busy?
[time=3374] In Ephesians he talks about this being the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
[time=3382] That's part of our battle equipment. How well do we know it?
[time=3390] I hope our elders know it. If they don't they better come to Logos.
[time=3403] How well do we know the word? How often do we pick it up?
[time=3412] Do we have a drive in our gut to learn more of what God says or do we turn on the TV?
[time=3426] The Spirit clearly says that in latter times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits in things taught by demons.
[time=3437] And if you do not think our culture that bombard just daily is not demon driven than your naive.
[time=3449] He is the prince of the power of the airwaves. Let's pray.
[time=3461] Father, I thank you for this flock. They've been dear to Carolyn and I for a long time.
[time=3470] I thank you for the ministry that has been here for so many years.
[time=3475] And as we go through this transition I pray that you will be with the elders and deacons.
[time=3482] You'll be with the teaching team that you'll give ample wisdom and direction as to next steps.
[time=3491] That this body will flourish and continue to grow and lean on you, not on any one pastor, but on Jesus.
[time=3502] And Father, I just thank you for your grace, your goodness.
[time=3508] Now prick our hearts and our conscience that we would not rest until we give you ample time.
[time=3516] That we would not be comfortable until we put down the exercise gear and said I need the Bible.
[time=3527] Help us to fall in love with you all over again.
[time=3532] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=3562] You
