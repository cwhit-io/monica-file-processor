[time=257] Let's give him praise.

[time=914] [APPLAUSE]
[time=920] I'm glad you're here today, and I think Lindsay is right that for some of you Father's Day is a great time of rejoicing and celebration.
[time=928] For some of you, it's not because your dads are imperfect because they've, as the songs that they've failed a thousand times, and they weren't there for you.
[time=937] So running into the arms of a father to you sounds like we sang. It sounds very strange. And I understand that.
[time=946] My parents have been married for 45 years, so they've left me and my sister are a great legacy, but that's not your story maybe this morning.
[time=953] I want to encourage you today that despite the flaws of your earthly father and every one of our father's earthly fathers are flawed.
[time=962] Your heavenly father is a good father. He's a father of lights. He knows how to give good gifts to his children.
[time=969] And so I encourage you with that this morning. If you're hurting today, I'm glad that you're here.
[time=974] We get to hear today about a father who loves his children, who gave his son that you might have life.
[time=981] And I want to pray this morning as we begin. We have a lot to talk about. I'm so excited about all of it.
[time=986] I'm glad that you're here today. Would you pray with me?
[time=989] Father, from this pulpit and from this stage in months gone by, I have thanked you for the fact that there are people who pray for us.
[time=1003] And they're faithful. God, faithful to pray that we would be diligent caretakers of the sacrifices that people make financially.
[time=1016] That this place we carry on will be faithful, proclaimers of the good news of the gospel.
[time=1023] And God, I pray today that you would be with us and that you would go before me as we share today.
[time=1030] That what is caught and what is remembered and what is celebrated is what Paul said nothing but the cross of Christ.
[time=1040] God, may we have unity together.
[time=1043] May we be clear in our faithful proclamation of the good news.
[time=1048] And God, may we have humility as we do it. As Paul calls the church at Corinth to do.
[time=1053] Proud those things in Jesus name with a full heart God and with great thanksgiving. Amen.
[time=1062] We are beginning a new series this morning called Life Together.
[time=1065] We're going to be in first and second Corinthians all summer.
[time=1068] So if you have your Bibles, if you'd open to first Corinthians, New Testament has Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, four gospels.
[time=1075] After John is the book of Acts and after Acts is the book of Romans, after Romans is first Corinthians right before second Corinthians.
[time=1084] So you're welcome. First is before second Corinthians in case you were wondering.
[time=1088] All of Paul's letters in the New Testament are arranged by their size.
[time=1094] So Romans is the longest that one goes first right after that is first Corinthians and so on and so on and so on.
[time=1100] So that's where we're going to start today is first Corinthians chapter one.
[time=1105] We're not going to get everything in these letters, but we're going to hit some key points that we believe are going to be encouraging to you and are going to help you to face whatever you're having to face in the days to come.
[time=1116] Reading Paul's letters is kind of like Facebook used to be. Remember Facebook kids?
[time=1121] You're not on Facebook anymore, but your moms are. Everyone's mom is on Facebook these days.
[time=1125] All the kids have moved on to other things, but kids, Facebook back in the day, it was all you could see on Facebook was one side of a conversation.
[time=1134] Remember that? If you were friends with somebody and you weren't friends with the person they were talking to, you couldn't see the conversation.
[time=1142] All you saw was your friend. You can kind of figure it out with what was being said, but all you had was one side of the Facebook conversation.
[time=1151] That's pretty much what reading Paul's letters are like in that way.
[time=1155] All we know is what Paul is saying to these people who lived in a place called Corinth.
[time=1159] We don't know what they were saying back to him. We can kind of figure it out and kind of read between the lines, but we have pretty much kind of figured out as we go.
[time=1166] And I think we have enough information to do that this morning, but that's maybe what the difficulty is.
[time=1172] It's like one side of a phone conversation. You're listening to someone talking to the phone, but you can't hear the other side of the conversation.
[time=1177] That's maybe a better analogy for everybody in the room, a phone conversation.
[time=1182] Paul is the first word if you have your Bibles open. Paul is the first word of 1 Corinthians.
[time=1189] So it seems important to talk about him just for a minute as we begin this morning.
[time=1194] Paul knew the place that he's ministering to, corn, if you knew it well, he lived there for about 18 months.
[time=1201] Paul was a traveling preacher and church planter in the book of Acts, which comes before the book of Romans, which is right before the book of 1 Corinthians, tell us that whole story.
[time=1210] Paul was there in Corinth for about 18 months. He loved and knew these people. He knew them very, very well.
[time=1216] Paul's letters are full of actual people. You hear their names this morning, names like Sosthenes, names like Chloe, names like Cephas and Apollos, real people.
[time=1229] Paul writes his letters in real time to people that he knew and that he knew very well.
[time=1235] And so that's an application, friends, that you can take good comfort in.
[time=1239] These are not letters from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, or once upon a time there was a land called Corinth, not like that.
[time=1247] It's an actual place, Corinth. He calls people by name. It says in verse 2, he wrote this letter to the church of God that is in Corinth.
[time=1256] It's an actual place. You can go visit there. There'll be some pictures on the screen behind me.
[time=1261] In Paul's day, Corinth was a very wealthy city. It was multicultural. It was an urban center. It was right on the way, but it's on a peninsula.
[time=1270] And you couldn't get from point A to point B without passing through Corinth. As opposed to going all the way around, you could go right through Corinth.
[time=1278] There was a theater in Corinth that held 18,000 people. What does the Colosseum hold? Not that many, I don't think. A lot, but not that many.
[time=1287] 18,000 people. Isn't that amazing? There was a hill overlooking Corinth called the Acra Corinth.
[time=1294] It's one of those pictures that you're seeing shuffling through.
[time=1298] That 1,000 prostitutes once worked there. So that's not a good indicator about the spiritual health of the place like Corinth.
[time=1307] It was a city that thrived on trade because it was between one place and the other.
[time=1313] So when people are always passing through, they're looking for all kinds of diversions.
[time=1318] And it led to all kinds of problems as you would expect in a place like Corinth. Listen to this.
[time=1324] Greek ideals like individualism, equality, freedom, distrust of authority were pervasive in a place like Corinth.
[time=1336] Isn't that interesting? Sounds very familiar. Gordon Fee is a famous commentator on the New Testament.
[time=1342] He said that Corinth in the ancient world was like New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas all wrapped in the one.
[time=1349] That puts it in perspective for you. Wow, New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas of the ancient world.
[time=1356] I'm leaving for the Ravi Zacharias International Ministries Convention today.
[time=1361] So today is a good day for me and Father's Day. I leave my family, which is a bummer, but I'll be there all week.
[time=1367] And Ravi Zacharias described the globalization of the world as the Los Angelization of the world,
[time=1373] where there's a Korean selling kosher tacos in a place like Los Angeles.
[time=1379] So things like that give us a little bit of insight as to what the city of Corinth may have been like.
[time=1384] What's the first word of 1 Corinthians again? Class? Paul, here we go. Let's talk about him just for a minute.
[time=1390] We meet him again in Acts, which is two books to the left in your Bibles. If you want to go there, you're welcome to do it.
[time=1397] It's really the Acts of the Holy Spirit, not the Acts of the Apostles, is sometimes called, because the Holy Spirit is everywhere to be found there in the Book of Acts.
[time=1405] There we learn that Paul was a shining star in the Jewish religious leadership in their community.
[time=1411] He was actually there at the murder of the first Christian martyr, a man named Stephen.
[time=1416] And it says in Acts 8 that he was there, and he agreed completely that he gave full approval of the murder of Stephen.
[time=1427] That's disturbing. Jewish execution was a method called stoning, and they would throw somebody into a pit.
[time=1434] And the men around the pit would hurl large stones until the person in the pit was dead.
[time=1439] Very personal, very brutal. And Saul was there, and he said, this is a good thing that we should murder Stephen because he's a Christian.
[time=1449] Acts 8 goes on and says that Saul underwent a ravaging campaign. He was breathing out threats and murder against the church in Acts 9.
[time=1458] He was not a neutral party, is my point. This is the same person that is now called Paul in 1 Corinthians.
[time=1466] He went as far as Damascus in the north. The Damascus, if you don't know your Middle Eastern geography, here's Jerusalem down here.
[time=1472] And Damascus is 200 miles or so north of Jerusalem. So what, Steve? The point is this.
[time=1479] He wasn't like going next door. He wasn't going over to New Haven. He went far, far away to Indianapolis campaigning against the church.
[time=1488] Now in those, that's a long way to go in those days. That was not just a jaunt down the street.
[time=1492] He was deliberately determined to wipe out the church that was attached to Jesus.
[time=1498] So there was a threat as an enemy. On his way to Damascus, he'll never guess what happened.
[time=1505] Yes, you would. Some of you know. He met someone on the way to Damascus. He met Jesus.
[time=1511] A bright light knocked into the ground, it says in Acts 9.
[time=1520] What are you doing? Saul, who are you persecuting? The voice says, who are you, Lord?
[time=1529] And the voice in response says, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
[time=1535] I'm staggered by that. And here's why. Hope you're listening.
[time=1539] I'm staggered by it for this reason that Jesus identifies with his church so closely that he sees Saul's threats and murder as personal.
[time=1549] Not against his acquaintances or against someone that he may have run into, but against himself.
[time=1556] That's how he feels about his church.
[time=1560] So friends, that's why it's important that we have a good understanding of what the church is supposed to be like and how it's supposed to operate,
[time=1566] because it's referred to as the bride of Christ. He loves the church that much.
[time=1572] He says, Saul, stop persecuting me. I've been married for almost 15 years.
[time=1578] And if you had unhelpful things to say about my wife, there would be relational friction between us.
[time=1584] People are down the church these days, organized religion.
[time=1588] They're all about Jesus, but not about the church so much. I hear that a lot.
[time=1594] And I just think to myself, the Bible tells a very different story.
[time=1599] The church has made up of people, so people have problems.
[time=1603] They fail a thousand times, fathers and mothers and sons and daughters. We've all got problems.
[time=1609] But he has commissioned us as his light in the world.
[time=1613] Amen? So it's important for us to behave as though that's who we are.
[time=1619] So Saul comes to know Jesus, doesn't just know about him, but knows him personally,
[time=1625] probably less than two years after Jesus died and rose again.
[time=1629] And he writes his letter to 1 Corinthians, the 1 Corinthians letter, about 20 years later, after a long campaign of ministry.
[time=1636] God only uses broken and flawed people to do his work.
[time=1641] There aren't other kind of people. Name me a person from the Bible, again, he was very prominent whom God used mightily, and I'll show you a person that's broken or flawed.
[time=1650] You might say, well, yes, Steve, but I have to get my act together before I can really serve in the church.
[time=1656] And I would say you'll be waiting your whole life.
[time=1659] Because I didn't walk up here saying to myself, well, I got it all together.
[time=1663] I'm just going to deal out some answers today.
[time=1665] That's not where I'm coming from. I hope you know that. That's not where I'm coming from.
[time=1669] God only uses flawed broken people and he needs, he's asking for you to serve on his behalf to be his ambassador,
[time=1676] to be the church.
[time=1678] Paul declared himself to be the arch enemy of Jesus until he met him, and then everything changed.
[time=1684] People who meet Jesus' guides are either radically changed or they're scandalized.
[time=1688] If you read the Gospel of Mark, for example, it's always this strong reaction.
[time=1693] They're amazed, they're knocked over, they're just blown away by him everywhere they go.
[time=1697] Paul comes to Corinth preaching this message, this gospel message of a crucified God, and they didn't know what to do with it. They were freaked out.
[time=1705] There's a picture that I first came into contact with about 10 years ago, and you can see it fairly well on the screen.
[time=1711] The inscription says, "Alexaminos worships his God." And you can see it's a picture of a man looking at a crucified donkey.
[time=1722] This is what the first century sophisticated world thought of the message of Christianity.
[time=1728] You worship a crucified God, why would you do that?
[time=1732] That's why Paul says in verse 17 of chapter 1, the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing.
[time=1738] It's always been that way. It will always be that way.
[time=1742] It will always be counter-cultural, the gospel.
[time=1746] And this picture brings that, I think, into full and striking focus.
[time=1753] This is the world that Paul was preaching to, that he was ministering to.
[time=1759] Would you go with me please now into 1 Corinthians chapter 1?
[time=1761] We're going to read the introduction here and get some sense of where Paul is coming from
[time=1767] and what he's doing. We'll start with verse 1. 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 1.
[time=1773] Paul pulverites us again in the early 50s, about 20 years after Christ is risen from the dead.
[time=1779] Paul, called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and our brother, Sostonese,
[time=1786] to the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=1796] both their Lord and ours, grace to you in peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1802] I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus.
[time=1810] Watch the word grace in this section.
[time=1813] Then in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and knowledge, even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you.
[time=1823] So you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=1829] who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1834] God is faithful by whom you were called into the fellowship of his son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=1841] I was on a plane once and you know how when you get far away from something, you're not sure if it was what you said or what you wanted to say.
[time=1849] It's kind of where I was, kind of where I am this morning.
[time=1851] Did I actually say it or do I hope I said it? I don't know.
[time=1854] But the guys, we got in a conversation as people on planes sometimes do and he said well what do you do?
[time=1859] I said well I'm a teacher and he asked me what do you teach?
[time=1863] I said Bible and he gave me this look that I can't even describe like why would you do that?
[time=1870] I was like that's your job? Really? He felt like he felt sorry for me.
[time=1875] And so the conversation is off to a really good start.
[time=1879] As you might imagine we're on a plane for a couple of hours so I'm like the most of it.
[time=1883] Then we got talking about how he asked me questions like well how come Paul and Jesus disagree on so many things?
[time=1891] I thought that was very interesting and I hope I said show me some of those ways.
[time=1897] I don't think I did though, I think I may have stambered and stumbled, I don't know.
[time=1900] How does Paul identify himself in the first verse of 1 Corinthians as an apostle of Christ Jesus?
[time=1906] In fact read through all Paul's letters, every one of the first verses of all his letters he's always an apostle of Christ Jesus.
[time=1912] There is no daylight between Paul and Jesus, none.
[time=1916] An apostle friends is a person who is sent out, Jesus personally met Paul and said Paul I want you to go.
[time=1923] I want you to go on my behalf and preach the good news in my name.
[time=1927] There is no daylight between Paul and Jesus.
[time=1930] They had different ministries, Paul was going to the Gentiles, Christ was ministering to the people of Israel.
[time=1935] The church was founded, was moving on and so different calls, different audiences but no conflict, no conflict.
[time=1942] Look at verse 4, verse 4, these are all the things that are available to people who are in Christ.
[time=1949] I had a very busy week before I get, I had a very busy week this week and I had people come talk to me who are hurting and broken.
[time=1960] And they feel all kinds of things, I feel like nobody would know if I was gone Steve.
[time=1965] I feel like I have nothing to offer, nothing to give.
[time=1970] They feel this way, very strongly.
[time=1974] I'll say to you what I said to them, don't let your feelings drive the bus.
[time=1981] It's profound, I know.
[time=1984] Don't let your feelings drive the bus because you feel unloved some days and unworthy and I can't get it right and nobody cares about me.
[time=1993] I get feeling that way, it doesn't mean it's true in Christ.
[time=1998] Listen to this, you don't believe me, look at it, look at it.
[time=2001] Verse 4, in Christ Jesus, that's how we begin, end of verse 4, verse 5.
[time=2006] You're enriched in Him in all speech and all knowledge but that's a lot.
[time=2012] Everything I know, everything I say is enriched by Him if I'm in Christ.
[time=2016] Verse 7, lacking, it says, no spiritual gift.
[time=2020] We have everything that we need in Christ.
[time=2023] Wow, but wait, there's more.
[time=2027] It says in verse 8 that we are personally sustained by Jesus and we have an identity that's without guilt.
[time=2034] Without guilt, you don't feel guiltless, you feel guilty.
[time=2038] What does God say? In Christ, guiltless.
[time=2042] Did you hear me?
[time=2044] Are you there this morning? You're very quiet.
[time=2046] Guiltless means that you feel guilty, you feel shame.
[time=2050] See that word feel, feel, feel.
[time=2053] We are a society entrapped by our feelings.
[time=2057] We want to feel good all the time and skim along life's surface and God says these things are true in Christ well below the surface.
[time=2067] You're guiltless in Him.
[time=2069] That's what He says about you. Do you believe it or not?
[time=2072] Amen. That's the question.
[time=2074] But that's the truth.
[time=2076] In Christ, guiltless.
[time=2080] Guiltless, that's good news from where I'm standing.
[time=2085] Fellowship with Jesus, verse 9.
[time=2089] Because of God's faithfulness, this is our identity in Christ.
[time=2093] If you are in Christ this morning, this is your identity.
[time=2096] You have a new identity.
[time=2098] You are a new creation, as Paul will go on to say, in 2 Corinthians.
[time=2104] Wow.
[time=2105] Friends, that's encouraging.
[time=2106] It's encouraging to me to be reminded of that again today.
[time=2109] And I don't know how you walked in here today.
[time=2112] But that's true, no matter how you got here, if you're up, if you're down, if you're kind of somewhere in the middle.
[time=2118] Those things are true despite how you feel, despite the economy, the news on television.
[time=2125] Which is bad. A lot of the time.
[time=2128] It makes me just anxious.
[time=2131] God's word is an anchor that will carry you through those stormy seas in your life.
[time=2135] And because we're all prone to forget things, I am.
[time=2139] Look at verse 10 of 1 Corinthians 1 this morning.
[time=2143] In your notes, in the bulletin, there's some things there to be mindful of.
[time=2148] There are three things that Paul is calling the Corinthians to, and I think us to.
[time=2152] Because of what he says in verse 2.
[time=2159] Or read verse 2 again.
[time=2160] Can I do that?
[time=2161] Of course I can.
[time=2163] To the church of, I'm going to anyway.
[time=2165] So here we go.
[time=2166] The church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus.
[time=2170] 1 Corinthians 1, 2.
[time=2171] Called to be saints together.
[time=2175] If you're inclined to mark in your Bibles, and that word is there, then circle it.
[time=2178] Called to be saints together.
[time=2181] With all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2187] Both their Lord and ours.
[time=2188] That's us.
[time=2189] So we have communion with them in that way because we are calling on his name this morning.
[time=2194] Aren't we?
[time=2195] We already have.
[time=2196] We are doing it right now.
[time=2197] We've prayed to him.
[time=2198] We've sung to him in worship.
[time=2199] We're opening his word together.
[time=2201] We are calling on Jesus name.
[time=2203] And so we have fellowship with the Corinthians in that way.
[time=2208] But we're doing it together.
[time=2210] Together.
[time=2211] And that's encouraging to me.
[time=2212] So verse 10.
[time=2214] I appeal to you verse 10 for Corinthians 1.
[time=2217] I appeal to you brothers and sisters by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that all of you agree and that there be no divisions among you but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment.
[time=2232] That would be enough to spend the rest of our time on right there.
[time=2235] But let me say a couple of things.
[time=2237] Respectfully.
[time=2239] There are people that come to knock on our doors.
[time=2242] They ride around our neighborhoods.
[time=2245] They all look the same.
[time=2247] And they all say the same thing.
[time=2249] Same literature.
[time=2251] I don't believe that's what God is calling us to.
[time=2254] That kind of unthinking.
[time=2256] Fall in line.
[time=2258] That's not what God is calling us to.
[time=2260] Being united, having no divisions doesn't mean we have to all like the same kind of music.
[time=2264] It doesn't mean that.
[time=2266] It means at the heart and the center and Paul will go on to say these things.
[time=2270] There's Jesus.
[time=2272] And because he's there, I can withstand all these other things that aren't in the middle.
[time=2276] They're out here.
[time=2278] I can withstand it if Christ is central.
[time=2280] Not Paul or Apollos or Peter or anybody else.
[time=2285] Jesus.
[time=2286] I can withstand all the pressures that weigh in on you from the outside if Christ is where he belongs at the middle.
[time=2292] I can do it.
[time=2294] And you can do it too.
[time=2295] Verse 11, it's been reported to me by Chloe's people and very personal.
[time=2299] There's quarrelling among you.
[time=2301] There's contention.
[time=2303] There's strife.
[time=2304] There's tugs of war.
[time=2305] The word is a wrangling.
[time=2307] Pulling back and forth.
[time=2308] I follow Paul.
[time=2309] I follow Apollos.
[time=2310] I follow Cephas, it says in verse 12.
[time=2313] Cephas is Peter.
[time=2315] Christ gave him that name.
[time=2317] It means rock.
[time=2320] Divisions.
[time=2321] And Paul goes on to say I'm so glad I wasn't there any longer.
[time=2324] I'll see how even more teams, I'm on Team Paul and Team Peter and Team Apollos.
[time=2330] I want you to be on Team Jesus.
[time=2332] That's what I want you to be on.
[time=2333] I want you to be about him.
[time=2335] And that makes everything else able to be withstood.
[time=2339] Look at this quote from A.W.
[time=2341] Tozer.
[time=2342] It's in a book called The Pursuit of God.
[time=2343] I encourage you with this quote.
[time=2348] I may have served with you before and that's okay.
[time=2351] One hundred worshipers meeting together.
[time=2354] Each one looking away to Christ are in heart nearer to each other than they could possibly be where they to become unity conscious and turn their eyes away from God and strive for closer fellowship.
[time=2366] The inevitable result of our rallying together around Jesus and not our preferences is that we will become closer together.
[time=2375] That's what he says.
[time=2376] I think he's right.
[time=2379] It's okay to have those preferences but if they threaten my fellowship that's where we get in trouble.
[time=2385] And here's where I want to say something specific.
[time=2387] People have asked in recent days, well I'm just concerned.
[time=2392] I'm not complaining, I'm just concerned.
[time=2395] Fill in the blank, whatever it is.
[time=2397] Church is everywhere.
[time=2398] The difference between being complaining what you shouldn't do and being concerned what you should do is a preposition.
[time=2405] You ready?
[time=2406] We complain about people.
[time=2410] We express concerns to people.
[time=2414] That's the difference.
[time=2415] It's part of the difference I think.
[time=2417] How do you know if you're complaining or if you're concerned?
[time=2419] Well I'm complaining about Jim to Jody.
[time=2425] I talk to Jim about Jim.
[time=2427] I express my concerns to him in that way.
[time=2430] That's the difference.
[time=2431] And that's where we have no cause to do it differently.
[time=2435] This is a quote.
[time=2436] This book is part of the inspiration for this name of the series, Life Together.
[time=2441] It's a book by Dietrich Bonhoeffer called Life Together.
[time=2444] It won't be on the screen but I did tweet it this morning from the Blackhawk Ministries Twitter accounts.
[time=2449] B-Hockman is our church Twitter account.
[time=2452] Please go follow us there.
[time=2454] I tweeted, that's a verb.
[time=2456] I tweeted on the Twitter.
[time=2460] Did I lose half of you?
[time=2461] I tweeted this morning this quote.
[time=2463] So here's the quote but it's on Twitter in cyberspace somewhere out there in the universe.
[time=2467] Okay, here we go.
[time=2468] You can go find it there.
[time=2469] Are you ready?
[time=2470] These are seven principles he says for eradicating selfishness in the assembly.
[time=2475] Here's the first one he says.
[time=2477] Guess what it is?
[time=2479] The ministry of holding one's tongue.
[time=2481] That's the first thing he says that will eradicate selfishness in the assembly.
[time=2486] Us gathered together.
[time=2488] Often he says we combat our evil thoughts most effectively.
[time=2492] If we absolutely refuse to allow them to be expressed in words.
[time=2496] Thus, it must be a decisive rule of every Christian fellowship that
[time=2502] each individual is prohibited from saying much that occurs to him.
[time=2506] We don't live in that kind of world do we?
[time=2509] We have a thought.
[time=2510] It's out there.
[time=2511] Whole world can see it.
[time=2512] And maybe I've deleted lots of things on the internet that I've said.
[time=2516] I probably shouldn't have said it.
[time=2517] But there it was for a few seconds.
[time=2518] It's out there.
[time=2519] This prohibition does not include the personal word of advice and
[time=2525] guidance.
[time=2526] We need that.
[time=2527] We need each other.
[time=2528] But to speak about a brother is forbidden.
[time=2532] Even under the cloak of help and goodwill.
[time=2535] It's precisely in this disguise the spirit of hatred among brothers creeps in when it's seeking to create mischief.
[time=2544] No quarrels among you.
[time=2546] And Paul says the antidote is to focus on Jesus.
[time=2551] To focus on Jesus.
[time=2552] And not I follow Jesus or I follow Paul or I follow Apollo.
[time=2557] He mentions those things in verses 12 and 13.
[time=2564] Francis Shafer in 1970 wrote a book about pollution that was before I was born 1970.
[time=2570] Wow.
[time=2571] I was a virtuous and middle aged man by my students this year.
[time=2574] I've been humbled by that tremendously.
[time=2576] I've been feeling very thoughtful.
[time=2578] I guess I'm at the middle of my life now.
[time=2580] So what am I doing with my life and all of those things?
[time=2583] He said this in 1970 during the Nixon administration.
[time=2587] To put it in perspective.
[time=2589] The church ought to be a pilot plant where men can see in our congregations and missions a substantial healing of all the
[time=2600] divisions that alienations of which man's rebellion has produced.
[time=2605] They will know we are Christians by our.
[time=2609] Say it again.
[time=2611] Love.
[time=2613] Look how they love each other.
[time=2618] Something's going on with those people.
[time=2620] They love each other.
[time=2621] In the book of Acts they were giving all their possessions.
[time=2626] Nothing in everything was in common as people had need.
[time=2629] They were giving it freely.
[time=2631] When that typifies a group of people people take notice of that.
[time=2635] Why has that place given half a million dollars to an organization in India?
[time=2640] Why have they done that?
[time=2641] I've got to find out.
[time=2643] Guys that makes Jesus look precious when people see us love each other and love our community.
[time=2649] Here and around the world it makes him look precious.
[time=2652] It makes him look small when we're at each other all the time.
[time=2655] It makes him look small and you know that.
[time=2657] I'm just reminding you of that.
[time=2658] I'm reminding you of what Paul says.
[time=2662] Sobering words here in verse 17 of chapter 1.
[time=2667] For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel and not with words of eloquent wisdom lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
[time=2678] So what?
[time=2679] Paul says I'm trying to be impressive and win followers for myself, team Paul, team Paul.
[time=2689] The cross is emptied of its power.
[time=2692] That's a strong statement.
[time=2695] Hard to imagine a stronger statement than that.
[time=2698] If my allegiance is ever and always first Jesus then so much of that nonsense it fades.
[time=2705] It doesn't matter but doesn't create strife and division.
[time=2710] And the word in the Greek for divisions is schisms.
[time=2713] It doesn't create schisms, people breaking apart.
[time=2716] John 17, the words of Jesus.
[time=2721] How does he feel about his children?
[time=2724] It's how he feels.
[time=2725] I don't ask for these only.
[time=2727] There's disciples around the table.
[time=2729] But also for those who will believe in me through their word.
[time=2732] That's us.
[time=2733] That's you and me.
[time=2735] We have received faithfully from God through these apostles the word that he has given.
[time=2742] Unbroken line of testimony from them.
[time=2744] Unbroken line of testimony.
[time=2748] But they may all be one.
[time=2750] One.
[time=2751] As you father are in me and I and you that they also may be in us that the world may believe that you have sent me.
[time=2762] But the world may believe, do you see that?
[time=2764] When they see us together, one rallying around the cross.
[time=2768] They'll believe.
[time=2771] When they don't, they won't.
[time=2774] Galatians 5.
[time=2776] These are strong words and I'm just trying to be faithful what God's word says.
[time=2781] Galatians 5.
[time=2783] The words of the flesh, Paul says in this letter to the Galatians are evident.
[time=2788] They're obvious.
[time=2789] Sexual immorality.
[time=2791] Impurity.
[time=2792] Sensuality.
[time=2793] Ideology.
[time=2799] Sorcery.
[time=2801] Emity.
[time=2802] Strife.
[time=2803] Jealousy.
[time=2804] Fits of anger.
[time=2805] Rivalries.
[time=2806] Decentions.
[time=2807] Divisions.
[time=2808] Envy.
[time=2809] Drunkenness.
[time=2810] Orgies.
[time=2811] Things like these.
[time=2812] I warn you as I warned you before that those who do or practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=2820] Strong language in the word of God.
[time=2825] People whose lives are typified by these things.
[time=2829] Categorized by division and anger and jealousy and strife and I want to get my way and I'll run you over if I don't get my way.
[time=2838] And I'll couch my concern and complaint.
[time=2841] Friends, there's warnings from God's word on that front.
[time=2844] And I just plead with you as a friend, as a shepherd.
[time=2849] That those who practice these things will not inherit God's kingdom.
[time=2853] What does that look like, Steve?
[time=2856] What does it mean?
[time=2859] I'm the ground.
[time=2860] I'd be hard pressed to say, but I know it when I see it.
[time=2862] And I think you do too.
[time=2864] If you complain about someone not expressed concern to them, that's division, that's quarrelling, that's strife and it doesn't honor God.
[time=2872] We are going to have problems because the church has made up of people.
[time=2875] Go to a new church.
[time=2876] There are people there too with real problems.
[time=2880] You've got to find a place where you can serve.
[time=2882] You've got to find a place where you can plug in and offer the gifts that God's given you.
[time=2886] You're lacking in Christ.
[time=2888] No spiritual gifts or might encourage them to use that you use it with our kids.
[time=2893] You use it however you can use it.
[time=2895] In whatever way that you can.
[time=2897] The body of Christ is all kinds of different people.
[time=2899] There are mouths and their feet and their hands, everything in between.
[time=2902] But use the gifts that God's given you.
[time=2905] So much to say.
[time=2908] The second point in your outline is on to chapter two.
[time=2911] And there's a lot to say that we will not say this morning for a sake of time.
[time=2915] And I'm sorry about that.
[time=2917] Chapter two.
[time=2918] So we have a call to unity.
[time=2920] And we have a call now, a number two, a call to clarity.
[time=2924] A clear gospel presentation.
[time=2928] This is 1 Corinthians chapter two starting in verse one.
[time=2932] And I, Paul says when I came to you, brothers and sisters, did not come proclaiming to you
[time=2938] the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom.
[time=2941] I wasn't trying to win fans, he says.
[time=2947] I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[time=2955] What do you do with the fact that Paul and Jesus disagree in so many things?
[time=2959] Nothing but Jesus.
[time=2961] And Him crucified nothing.
[time=2963] No thing.
[time=2964] And I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling.
[time=2969] The Bible is trustworthy for 100,000 reasons.
[time=2972] But here's one reason why.
[time=2974] Paul is not small potatoes in the church.
[time=2979] That's profound.
[time=2980] See, thank you very much.
[time=2981] He's a big deal because of what God has done in him.
[time=2984] Paul wrote half of what we call the New Testament.
[time=2987] I think you know that.
[time=2988] It's reminding you of it.
[time=2990] I came in weakness, Paul says.
[time=2992] I came in fear.
[time=2993] I came in trembling.
[time=2995] The flaws of Bible characters are on full display.
[time=2999] David's problems.
[time=3000] Moses's problems.
[time=3001] Abraham's problems.
[time=3003] You name it.
[time=3004] Jonah's problems.
[time=3005] Remember that?
[time=3006] Full display.
[time=3007] They aren't being hidden away.
[time=3008] Tucked under the, just don't see that.
[time=3011] They're on full display.
[time=3012] The Bible can be trusted.
[time=3014] Surely if I was making up a story, I wouldn't put the fact that Paul, the author of half the New Testament was a weak and fearful and trembling person.
[time=3023] He'd be super awesome.
[time=3028] But he's not.
[time=3029] A call to clarity.
[time=3032] My speech and my message, verse four, were not implausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration
[time=3038] of the spirit and of power that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but the power of God.
[time=3043] I don't know what Paul's thorn in the flesh was.
[time=3046] I remember he asked the God to remove it.
[time=3048] Are you with me?
[time=3049] Can you not if you remember that anywhere?
[time=3051] Paul had a problem, a physical problem of some kind.
[time=3054] No one really knows what it was.
[time=3055] It could have been with his eyes or something, a physical problem.
[time=3059] Don't know, but God did not take it away.
[time=3062] He begged him to do it and God didn't do it.
[time=3065] You know why?
[time=3067] So the word of the cross would be displayed in power because God's strength is made perfect in weakness and Paul found that out.
[time=3075] That's how he found it out.
[time=3077] Paul was probably very short.
[time=3079] Don't know.
[time=3080] Just don't know.
[time=3081] There's not much about that out there somewhere.
[time=3084] But probably a very small man, not impressive in that way.
[time=3088] He wasn't the Old Testament Saul.
[time=3090] He was like head and sword with everybody else.
[time=3092] He was a mighty warrior.
[time=3093] It wasn't what Saul was like in the New Testament who became Paul.
[time=3098] Paul was called a scrapmonger somewhere in the Bible.
[time=3101] A scrapmonger.
[time=3102] You're just dealing out these garbage, these words that mean nothing.
[time=3106] That's what the gospel sounded like to people that were sophisticated.
[time=3110] And that's okay, Paul says, as long as Christ is proclaimed and glorified.
[time=3117] Romans 1, 16, you know this verse.
[time=3119] I'm reminding you of it for I am not ashamed, Paul says, of the gospel.
[time=3124] Why?
[time=3125] It's the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes the Jew first and also to the
[time=3131] Greek.
[time=3132] Paul is committed on this front.
[time=3135] We have a call to clarity from Paul.
[time=3137] Nothing but Christ crucified.
[time=3139] Nothing.
[time=3140] Friends, let me share this with you.
[time=3146] In my years, I've known Christ almost half my life.
[time=3152] And in those years, there have been many times when I can feel my throat tighten up.
[time=3158] When I want to speak his name, name of Jesus.
[time=3161] Does it ever happen to you?
[time=3162] Probably not.
[time=3163] I'm the only one, I'm sure.
[time=3167] Does it happen to you?
[time=3169] Okay.
[time=3170] I will tell you this.
[time=3173] Maybe you have boldness and you have no problems and I want to talk to you after the service.
[time=3176] Because I want to learn more from you.
[time=3179] But for me and the fun with my friends, talk about spirituality, talk about God, talk about
[time=3185] things being inspired and there's no my heart is beaten.
[time=3189] No problems.
[time=3190] But you mentioned that name, Jesus and everything gets anxious because that's the name.
[time=3196] At his name, heaven and earth take notice, right?
[time=3202] I have never regretted speaking that name.
[time=3207] Never.
[time=3209] I have many times regretted not speaking it.
[time=3213] I bet your friends and your workmates and your neighbors want you to tell them what you believe.
[time=3218] And it may not go very well.
[time=3220] They might reject you and they might not respond well.
[time=3223] It doesn't mean they don't want to hear it from you or need to hear it from you.
[time=3227] Don't be cute and careful and nice in that way.
[time=3232] Speak his name.
[time=3233] Speak it lovingly, truthfully, but lovingly.
[time=3237] But my encouragement to you is to speak his name because they want to hear it from you.
[time=3241] Because it's true that there is salvation and no other name.
[time=3244] No other name.
[time=3246] It's true or it's not.
[time=3248] And Paul says, I wanted to know nothing but Christ crucified among you.
[time=3251] And so that's what he calls us to do too.
[time=3253] To clearly speak his name friends, I want to go back and not be nice.
[time=3258] That's not what I meant to say.
[time=3261] There's a time to be careful and to be wise.
[time=3263] I understand that.
[time=3266] My encouragement to you is to have boldness, to not be ashamed.
[time=3271] I know how it feels.
[time=3272] I know how it feels to have those anxious moments.
[time=3275] And friends, trust them.
[time=3277] I heard an atheist say one time that if you really think that I'm going to hell, you should talk to me about Jesus.
[time=3285] If you really believe it, if you don't, then why don't you tell people about it?
[time=3289] If you actually believe it and I was like, wow, he's right.
[time=3294] I believe it or I don't.
[time=3298] May Black Hawk Ministries be a place, the church at bat, Black Hawk be a place where
[time=3304] we proclaim the gospel in a place of unity with clarity.
[time=3308] And then letters, letters, letter three, number C, whatever in your outlines.
[time=3315] The third point, how's that?
[time=3317] Is the call to humility over and over again.
[time=3320] Paul says that there's no room for boasting.
[time=3323] No room for boasting.
[time=3327] Look at the end of chapter three with me, if you would.
[time=3329] Look at verse 18, 1 Corinthians 3, 18.
[time=3338] But no one deceive himself.
[time=3339] If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become
[time=3346] wise.
[time=3347] The wisdom of the world is folly with God for it's written, he catches the wise in their craftiness.
[time=3354] And again, the Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, they are futile, meaningless.
[time=3359] So let no one boast in men for all things are yours.
[time=3366] Paul, Apollos, Cephas, or Peter, or the world or life or death or the present or the future.
[time=3372] All are yours and you are Christ's and Christ is God's, a call to humility.
[time=3379] To God be the glory, to him says, great things he has done and great our redemption through
[time=3386] Jesus the Son.
[time=3392] The only goodness that people see in me, you are good, the song said this morning, when there's nothing good in me.
[time=3399] You are love on display for all to see.
[time=3404] Paul calls the church at Corinth, dear friends.
[time=3408] He calls them to unity, he calls them to clarity, he calls them to humility, and I believe with
[time=3417] my whole heart this morning, it's exactly what he's calling us to you as well.
[time=3421] And so I pray that we would love each other in that way.
[time=3424] We would be one as Christ prayed for his disciples, that nothing would interfere with the clarity
[time=3430] of our witness, and that we would be quick to say, God is gracious, God, it's not about me.
[time=3435] Would you stay in with me this morning as we close?
[time=3443] Happy Father's Day to all of you, so grateful to my dad for his years of example.
[time=3452] I know that it's hard for some of you, it's got to be in a room this size, it's got to be hard.
[time=3456] If you're in the sound of my voice on the internet or on TV, wherever you're watching
[time=3462] or listening, I know it's hard for some of you.
[time=3465] And I believe that there is salvation found in no other name, but Jesus.
[time=3470] And Black Hawk Ministries will always be committed to speaking that word.
[time=3475] It's counter-cultural.
[time=3479] Our culture says differently, and they always have.
[time=3483] May we be faithful in that way, friends.
[time=3485] Would you buy your heads and close your eyes and pray with me?
[time=3489] God, in this moment.
[time=3492] Again, all those in the sound of my voice, they heard this morning from your word that
[time=3500] Paul went to this place called Corinth, and all he talked about was the fact that your son died, that we might have life.
[time=3509] God, your word also says that if we confess to their mouth, Jesus is Lord, and believe
[time=3515] in our hearts that God raised him from the dead, that we will be saved.
[time=3519] And God, that's available today is the day of salvation.
[time=3524] God, anyone from the sound of my voice that would confess and believe those things this morning would be saved.
[time=3530] God, thank you for Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3535] May we be a place that is unified, that proclaims the gospel with clarity and with humility,
[time=3543] recognizing your great grace that you've shown to us.
[time=3547] I thank you for a beautiful day outside.
[time=3550] Thank you for the fact that you took us through the winter, and now here we are.
[time=3554] And as we enjoy the sunshine, God, I pray that we would remember what we heard this morning, and that we would rally around it, around your son, Jesus, and his name we pray.
[time=3565] [AMEN]
