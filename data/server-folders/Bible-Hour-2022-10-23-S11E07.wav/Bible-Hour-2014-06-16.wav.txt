[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] >> Well, hello and welcome again to the broadcast, it's great to spend these couple of minutes with you. My name's Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege of being on the team here at Black Hawk Ministries. And today on this broadcast, we have the privilege, as you'll see of honoring someone who's very special and very dear to our church family, somebody who really is, I believe, very special and very dear in the kingdom of God.
[time=59] Pastor Keith Moore has been a part of our team for over 15 years, but what you want to know about Keith and his wife, Catherine, is that they've been in ministry, they've been married 61 years, and Keith has been in full-time ministry for over 65 years.
[time=78] 65, faithful years, 65 years of life within the body of Christ using his gifts, preaching, teaching, leading, pastoring, and helping people for decades and decades and decades, and he has done it so well.
[time=96] Here at Black Hawk over the last 15 years, he has helped us in enormous ways in hospital visitations and nursing home care and funerals. He has cared for people in a loving and gentle way, in many cases at the end of their lives, and he has proven himself to be an incredibly faithful servant.
[time=117] I want to say to all of you out there in our viewing audience who are in Keith's stage of life, if you will, Keith and Catherine both are a wonderful example to you, as you see them today on the screen, just know that they are older people who have aged gracefully.
[time=135] They have been a part of the church for 65 years, and you know and I know that in those years things have changed. Things always change. Styles have changed. The way church works, it's changed.
[time=149] There are so many things about ministry over the years, and even here at Black Hawk, as we have changed and adjusted and altered the way we do things, Keith and Catherine have always been, always supportive and kind and gracious.
[time=164] Enduring change is not easy. Going through alterations and style, it's not an easy thing for people, but Keith and Catherine have done it in a way whereby they have supported unity. They have enhanced harmony.
[time=181] And they have proven themselves to be saints, and that they have given themselves to the Lord, to His ministry, to His church, and they have done it in a kind and respectful and honoring way. And I am so grateful, the older I get, for those who are ahead of me, who do that with great grace and with great character and with great integrity, and Keith and Catherine have done that.
[time=203] And so honor them with us today, as you watch, and be thankful for over 60 years of marriage and over 65 years of ministry. It's an incredible feat, and I'm so thankful that we got to be a part of this today. God bless you.
[time=216] Thank you so much for tuning in, and as always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=246] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=296] So good to see each and every one of you here this morning, so good to be together. Thankful for Adam leading us in worship. I loved hearing your voices. I loved really the privilege of hearing us as a family lift up and proclaim the truth and so grateful for your voices and the chance to worship God in spirit and in truth.
[time=319] And it's good to have this time now to open up God's Word. What a great, what a great beginning to our study of first and second Corinthians. Steve Webster provided us with last Sunday as we began this new teaching series that we've entitled life together.
[time=338] You know, God's great desire, my friends, God's perfect design for the church from day one when he birthed it has always been that we would be as a church, that we would be as the body of Christ together.
[time=354] It's exactly how he designed it. It's exactly what he wants. He has always wanted for the church to be together, together in proximity, together in heart, together in spirit, not divided, not broken, not distant, no, together.
[time=373] He has always desired and always designed that we would be together in attitude and together in action, no matter what, together harmonious, close, strong, committed to the Lord and each other.
[time=389] So each and every week as we move forward through the summer, as we make our way through these two letters that Paul wrote to the church at Corinth, I'll invite you to simply ask this very simple question, what can we learn each and every gathering that we're a part of here?
[time=408] What can we learn about life together in the family of God from 1 Corinthians or 2 Corinthians chapter, whatever chapter we may be in that day?
[time=418] There are things my friends that God wants us to see. I believe we believe there are things that God desires for us to consider.
[time=426] I believe God has for you and God has for me some things that he wants us to learn.
[time=432] From our message to our mindset as a church, from our relationships with each other here inside these four walls to our worship of him, from our sin to our obedience.
[time=448] We can ask the question and 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians will help us answer it, what is God's desire and design for the family of God, for the church and our life together.
[time=461] So this morning we come to 1 Corinthians chapter 5 and what a chapter it is, and we ask the question today, what can we learn about life together in the church from a close look at 1 Corinthians chapter 5?
[time=477] It is often our custom here to stand while we read. I'm so thankful that we stood this morning like we did.
[time=485] I thought Adam did a great job. I'll have you sit for this, but I do want you to just listen as we in honor and thanks of God's word, take in what he has for us here.
[time=496] I'm going to read this to you. Please follow along in your Bibles, on your iPads, on your phone.
[time=501] However it is, you're viewing the Scriptures. Follow with me 1 Corinthians chapter 5.
[time=507] It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, sexual sin, and immorality of such a kind as does not even exist among the Gentiles, that someone has his father's wife.
[time=525] I'll have you underline the word has there or just make note of it. It's important not only in the context of this verse, but even in the context of this chapter and our discussion this morning.
[time=537] It's very important that you understand, even right here out of the gate, that this word denotes this word has when you look at this word in the original language, you would see that the way in which it is written, it is written in the present tense.
[time=553] This is not something that happened. This is something that is happening.
[time=559] This word is given us in the present tense. It indicates ongoing and habitual action.
[time=567] This act, this deed, this that Paul addresses, this someone who has his father's wife, it is ongoing.
[time=578] And he says to the church at Corinth, "You, you have become arrogant and have not mourned instead so that the one who had done this deed would be removed from your midst."
[time=590] That's interesting there in verse two, it uses the word mourned. I'll remind you this morning, I'll encourage you with this all throughout the Scripture.
[time=597] God tells us, God shows us in the word of God that the proper response on your part or mine.
[time=606] The godly response to sin is mourning. Sin should make you sad. Sin should break our hearts. Sin should lead us to a place of absolute despair.
[time=617] The fact that sin is occurring, the fact that God's law is being violated, the fact that we have or someone else has done something to break and burden the heart of God.
[time=627] It should absolutely destroy and diminish our spirit. There should be a mourning in us.
[time=634] He said this is not the case with the church at Corinth, they had become arrogant.
[time=643] Instead, so that the one who had done this deed, if they had responded rightly, he says, would be removed from your midst.
[time=651] Interesting, we'll keep reading, "For I on my part, though absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged him who has so committed this as though I were present."
[time=663] In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled and I with you in spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus,
[time=672] I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
[time=683] Let me just say right there, unrepentant, ongoing, hard-hearted, calloused, shaking a fist in the face of God's sin.
[time=703] God does not tolerate. You're boasting. Your boasting is not good.
[time=714] Do you not know that a little leavens the whole lump of dough clean out the old leavens so that you may be a new lump?
[time=722] Just as you are in fact unleavened for Christ, our Passover also has been sacrificed.
[time=729] Let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
[time=740] I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people, those involved in sexual sin.
[time=747] I did not at all mean with the immoral people of this world or with the covetous and swindlers or with idolaters, for then you would have to go out of the world.
[time=759] And Paul didn't want that. Look at verse 11, but actually I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is an present tense ongoing habitual action and immoral person
[time=774] or covetous or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a swindler, not even to eat with such a one.
[time=783] For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Do you not judge those who are within the church?
[time=794] But those who are outside, God judges, remove the wicked man from among yourselves.
[time=803] So here's what I want to do this morning. I want to try and do this. I hope this will be helpful. I hope it can be actually encouraging for you.
[time=811] I want to just take the chapter. I just read those 13 verses. When I break it into two sections, it really does kind of lay out that way.
[time=819] I want to just give you some things to think about. I want to give you some things to consider. I want to give you some truth to ponder here this morning from those two sections.
[time=828] And then having looked at the chapter as a whole briefly, I do want to give you some practical things I believe each and every one of you.
[time=836] Men and women, young and old kids, everybody.
[time=842] I believe there are some things that you could walk away with today, some practical truth that you could hang on to, some things that you could give yourself to,
[time=850] that I believe would help us in this area of fighting for, being diligent about, the purity that God desires for us, fighting against sexual sin.
[time=863] And I said this first hour, I'll say it second. Anytime you come to 1 Corinthians 5, anytime you teach on this subject of sexual purity, there is at times often a quick and sometimes immediate assumption that the teaching on that subject is for men.
[time=883] And I want to just remind you this morning that if ever there was a day, if ever there was a world, if ever there was a culture, when that is not the case, it is ours today.
[time=892] This is something that affects every single one of us.
[time=896] It affects our young ones.
[time=898] It affects our older ones.
[time=900] It affects men and women.
[time=902] And it is something that we have to look at, address, and give ourselves to.
[time=907] And Paul will give us some things to consider here in these next few moments as to why this is so important.
[time=913] Number one, I hope you'll write this down.
[time=915] Immorality, my friend, sexual sin, Paul says, infects the church.
[time=921] It is an infection.
[time=923] It is a disease, if you will.
[time=925] Immorality infects the church.
[time=928] And so Paul says, deal with, deal with the infection.
[time=933] That's right.
[time=934] Look at verse two, you have become arrogant and have not mourned instead so that the one who had done this deed would be removed.
[time=944] From your midst.
[time=946] And I would just tell you right up front, we don't talk about this very often.
[time=952] We probably should talk about this more often.
[time=956] And this may seem like, this may seem severe.
[time=961] This may seem a little out there.
[time=963] You may be looking at your Bible right now going, wait, did it really say that?
[time=967] Remove them from our midst?
[time=971] It does.
[time=975] And I've been trying to figure out how to illustrate this or just communicate it in a really clear way.
[time=982] I think it's pretty clear on its own, but I'll just say it to you like this and I'm not trying to be funny.
[time=988] I would just have you think about a couple.
[time=990] I would have you think about a married couple and maybe some of you have been that or are that.
[time=997] It's really at its foundation, at its foundation.
[time=1002] It's really not a whole lot different than in my 26 years of marriage and however many years you've been married.
[time=1008] There are times when I've gotten really, really sick.
[time=1014] And when you have a house full of others and you have a life that's going to continue to go on and one of you is really, really sick.
[time=1024] The one who's really, really sick often sleeps somewhere else, if that makes sense.
[time=1030] Oftentimes they're really, really sick one because they are contagious.
[time=1040] Oftentimes the one that's really, really sick is sick oftentimes is removed because we don't want the other one getting one.
[time=1051] Sick.
[time=1054] It doesn't mean that they don't love each other.
[time=1058] It doesn't mean that it's all over.
[time=1062] It means you got to go over here because this, this isn't good because there's danger now with this.
[time=1072] A danger that could even go beyond these two.
[time=1075] It's a danger that could impact even others.
[time=1078] Does that make sense?
[time=1080] That's really at the foundation of Paul's warning here.
[time=1084] Immerality infects the church.
[time=1086] So deal with the infection.
[time=1088] The infectious, contagious nature of unrepentant, ongoing sin in the life of a believer cannot be ignored.
[time=1102] You have become arrogant and have not mourned.
[time=1106] Instead you've ignored so that the one who had done this deed would be removed from your midst.
[time=1112] Let me say it to you this way here at Blackhawk.
[time=1115] If you were, if you were engaged in unrepentant, ongoing, blatant sexual sin or sin of another kind,
[time=1130] sin having to do with another type of endeavor.
[time=1134] I would, as your pastor and friend we would as a leadership, I would plead with you.
[time=1142] I would beg you to stop.
[time=1147] If somehow I became aware of it or if somehow a godly trusted friend became aware of it, we would do all that we could do to beg you, to soften your heart, to pursue repentance,
[time=1159] to take clear steps away from that sin.
[time=1163] And we would do that because we love you.
[time=1166] We would do that because we care for you.
[time=1168] We would do that because we want God's best for you.
[time=1171] And we also would do that in light of the passage here because we also care about the life of this church.
[time=1178] There are times when in the scope of what's going on in the home, there's one who needs to go to the couch.
[time=1186] And we would do that because we love you and we would do that because we love this family and God's Word says
[time=1194] that when there's sickness, that when there's disease, the love and then the unleaven, it doesn't work.
[time=1205] And if you're a response to me, if you're a response to a loving leader who would come along and humbly ask that of you
[time=1215] to pursue repentance, to step away from the sin, if your response is no, if it's an arrogant no,
[time=1221] if it's a, I like my sin, I don't really care about my profession of faith, nor do I care about my sin's infectious danger.
[time=1231] And by the way, if you live with what I live with, you would understand why I'm doing it.
[time=1238] And if that's what was heard in that oftentimes, I'll tell you is exactly what you hear.
[time=1247] If there's a rejection of truth and a justifying to what we do, we reject truth and we justify our actions.
[time=1256] And if there's a rejection of truth and a hard-hearted commitment to continue in the sin and a justification for why it's being done,
[time=1264] then I would lovingly ask you to stay home.
[time=1270] I would lovingly, we would lovingly ask you to go to the couch because there's just way, way too much.
[time=1279] Way, way too much at stake.
[time=1283] Now, if your response is humble, if your response is gracious, if your response is a brokenness,
[time=1293] there is a desire in you to kind of somehow come out of it.
[time=1297] If there's a desire to get on your knees and with a humble spirit, confess your sin, if that confrontation is exactly what you needed.
[time=1306] And there's a willingness in you to move toward what is right.
[time=1309] Let me just say it to you here publicly.
[time=1311] I would say it to you privately.
[time=1313] We would do anything to help you.
[time=1317] We would be patient.
[time=1318] We would be long-suffering.
[time=1319] We would walk with you through highs and lows.
[time=1322] We would help you get connected to this group or help you get connected to this individual.
[time=1327] We would help provide you with counseling.
[time=1329] We would help provide you with encouragement.
[time=1331] We would go up.
[time=1332] We would go down.
[time=1333] We would go as long as the road would need to go to help you if there's a willingness and a readiness in you to move away from the sin in your life.
[time=1343] But it is a very big deal.
[time=1347] And Paul tells him right here, it cannot be ignored.
[time=1353] Let me give you the next little section of the chapter here and watch how Paul even expands his scope and his focus from sexual sin to other sins.
[time=1367] He says in verse 10, I did not at all, I wrote you in my letter, verse 9, not to associate with immoral people.
[time=1375] I didn't mean immoral people of the world or with the covetous people who watch this now because sometimes we start thinking about sexual sin and we put it up here.
[time=1387] And he says, we'll be careful with that because yes, I'm talking about that and yes, that's very serious.
[time=1393] But he says also the covetous, those are people who want things too badly.
[time=1401] Swindlers, those who deceive people or idolaters, those who really worship other gods besides the real God.
[time=1411] For then you would have to go out of the world.
[time=1413] But actually, here's what I want you to look at, verse 11, but actually I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is an immoral person or a covetous person.
[time=1422] Or an idolater or a reviler.
[time=1424] Now he talks about those who cause trouble or a drunkard, self-explanatory or a swindler, a deceiver, not even to eat with such a one.
[time=1435] When that one is hard-hearted, calloused, unrepentant, fished in the face of God, get out of here, I'm not listening to you, leave me alone.
[time=1449] The point here with sexual sin, or as Paul notes any other sin, is that Paul is trying to protect the purity of the church.
[time=1457] Oh friends, please look at that phrase.
[time=1459] Please just stop and look at it for a second.
[time=1462] You might want to write it down.
[time=1464] I just would invite you to stop and ponder the impact and the implication of that phrase.
[time=1470] Oftentimes you'll think about purity as it relates to your life.
[time=1477] Oftentimes think of purity and the call that we as individuals have to it.
[time=1482] But I want you to hear this morning and understand that Paul is addressing.
[time=1487] And Paul is trying to protect and God through his word is lifting up the great value of the church's purity.
[time=1496] Our collective, yours, and yours, and yours and mine, he says in this whole thing here matters.
[time=1514] You can't be off the rails, unrepentant and hard-hearted on any front, and it not affect us.
[time=1531] Not your heads if you're getting that.
[time=1533] That's big.
[time=1535] The purity of the church, he's trying to protect the purity of the church as it relates to a people who are supposed to be living
[time=1543] a different standard.
[time=1545] He makes a great point.
[time=1546] He's not addressing people who don't have a personal faith in Christ.
[time=1551] He calls them the world.
[time=1553] People who simply live for themselves.
[time=1556] You don't judge them, Paul says.
[time=1558] Sexual sin, coveting, swindling people, committing idolatry.
[time=1563] That's simply how people who don't know God or love God or follow his son live.
[time=1571] Or said differently, you don't judge or confront unbelievers for living like what?
[time=1577] Unbelievers.
[time=1579] Unbelievers are going to live like unbelievers.
[time=1582] It's who they are.
[time=1584] It's how they live.
[time=1585] It's how they function.
[time=1587] He says, no, no, no, no.
[time=1589] He says, I want you to lovingly but boldly confront those who are living like unbelievers but claim to be what?
[time=1598] Believers.
[time=1600] This he says is not good.
[time=1602] This he says won't work.
[time=1604] This he says is infectious.
[time=1607] It's contagious.
[time=1615] Paul says here in this passage that person is not welcomed.
[time=1618] The church has struggled with this.
[time=1621] For years and years and years the church has struggled with this.
[time=1625] We have basically gone the opposite.
[time=1627] We have basically as a church and I'm talking church history for hundreds of years.
[time=1633] The church has done a great job of throwing buckets of stones at the world.
[time=1640] And judging them for being the godless, unholy, rank, profane people that they are when in fact that's exactly who they are.
[time=1652] And they're just living like who they are.
[time=1656] And what we've done is we've turned a blind eye way too many times.
[time=1659] We've not taken it as seriously as we should have inside the four walls while wasting our efforts in judgment toward those outside.
[time=1671] 1 Corinthians 5 teaches us that when it comes to the life and health of a church, sin is a really big deal.
[time=1682] Sexual sin is a really big deal, covetousness and swindling and idolatry and reviling and drunkards and the list goes on.
[time=1695] We've talked about it before in here.
[time=1697] I'll say it to you again.
[time=1699] Any sin is heinous.
[time=1701] Any and all sin is destructive.
[time=1706] And if you walk away with one thing this morning, I hope you walk away with just a big bullet point.
[time=1711] Just a big phrase, a big truth just right across the middle of your heart, sin.
[time=1718] Yours in mind as it relates to the collective of this family is a really big deal.
[time=1728] Left unconfessed, any sin can destroy and deplete one's spiritual heart.
[time=1735] And when you don't address the sin in your life, and if I don't address the sin in mind, if collectively there is a laziness about sin and arrogance regarding our sin or any level of complacency towards sin and the confession of it,
[time=1755] it will devastate your life and the life of your faith community, your church.
[time=1761] And I want to take you back to what I said there.
[time=1764] I want to just say one thing just to remind you.
[time=1767] If collectively there is a laziness about sin and arrogance regarding our sin or any level of complacency towards sin and the confession of it, please be reminded this morning that that is what God is after here.
[time=1786] That's what I'm after here this morning, trying to lift up this truth to you.
[time=1790] This is not about embarrassing you.
[time=1793] This is not about trying to bust you.
[time=1795] This is not about holding you up as some bad example.
[time=1798] This is not about shaming you.
[time=1801] This is about the heart of God and hopefully the heart of a church that wants to in each and every case simply see someone's heart move from heart to soft.
[time=1810] See someone's heart move from defiance to dependence, to see somebody move toward confession, to agree with God about the sin, to confess it as such and to be willing to move in a different direction.
[time=1826] That's the ball game.
[time=1828] That's what he's after.
[time=1830] He loves you.
[time=1832] He doesn't want to ruin you.
[time=1835] He doesn't want to make a mockery of you.
[time=1837] No, he wants to give you life.
[time=1840] And there is no life when you're stuck in that place.
[time=1844] So what are we supposed to do?
[time=1846] What is our response to be when it comes to this issue of sexual sin or other sins that can begin to deplete and destroy our life together, the life and the health of a church?
[time=1861] Look with me, if you will, at Paul's letter to the church at Rome, briefly.
[time=1866] Please, just look at Romans 8.
[time=1870] You got your iPad or your phone or your Bible?
[time=1872] Just look at Romans 8, 12.
[time=1874] And here is the answer to that question.
[time=1877] What are you supposed to do?
[time=1879] Here it is.
[time=1880] Well, there's ten things you're supposed to do, but here's the one thing I want you to hear this morning.
[time=1884] So then, brethren, verse 12, we are under obligation as believers, not to the flesh to live according to the flesh, for if you are living according to the flesh, you must die, and you will.
[time=1900] But if by the spirit you are putting to, what, say it, church, death, if you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
[time=1913] I asked Katie to just bold that phrase, to put it in italics.
[time=1916] I think she did.
[time=1917] Put to death.
[time=1919] This is what we are to do.
[time=1921] Someone once said that in the heat and despair of combat and war, one must remember, kill or be killed.
[time=1932] And you may or may not like that illustration.
[time=1935] It is a perfect illustration when it comes to the nature of the fight with sin.
[time=1941] You will either kill it, you will either roll up your sleeves and go to whatever lengths you have to go to to fight it.
[time=1950] Or it will destroy you, kill it, or it will kill you.
[time=1956] So in the time remaining, I want to either expose you to some sin-killing truth, teach you something maybe you've never heard before.
[time=1970] And that's great.
[time=1971] If that's the case, if you're here and you haven't heard these things before, we're so thankful.
[time=1975] Or for those of you who have heard it before, I want to provide you with what may be for you a powerful and timely reminder from the Word of God.
[time=1983] This is our application for this morning.
[time=1985] Here's the stuff that we do.
[time=1987] James says we can't just be hearers of the word.
[time=1990] We must be doers of the word.
[time=1992] And so here you are, family.
[time=1994] Here are some things for you to take with you this morning.
[time=1997] Learning to fight.
[time=1998] Fighting sexual sin.
[time=2000] You've got a handout inside.
[time=2001] You can write some things in if you want to.
[time=2003] Number one, here we are.
[time=2005] Realize.
[time=2006] Realize in your fight against sexual sin.
[time=2009] Realize that the biblical prohibition, where God says no, don't do that.
[time=2015] Realize that the biblical prohibition regarding sexual sin, they are intended to protect something precious.
[time=2024] Not deny something pleasant.
[time=2028] God's prohibitions in this arena are not meant to deny something pleasant.
[time=2035] No, they are intended to protect something that's very, very valuable and very, very dear.
[time=2043] Something very, very precious.
[time=2045] Look at 1 Thessalonians 4-3.
[time=2047] 1 Thessalonians 4-3 says for this is the will of God.
[time=2051] Couldn't be any more clear.
[time=2053] Your sanctification.
[time=2056] Sanctification, stop right there.
[time=2058] That's the something precious.
[time=2060] That's the something dear.
[time=2062] That's the something that's really special.
[time=2065] Sanctification is the process He wants for you to over time, week after, week, month after month, year after year.
[time=2073] He wants you to be growing in your relationship with Him, becoming more and more like Him in character and heart.
[time=2080] This is a gift.
[time=2081] This is a precious thing He allows to happen.
[time=2085] And as you engage in sexual or other sin, it just, it ruins, it nullifies, it just depletes that whole thing.
[time=2097] This precious, powerful thing called sanctification.
[time=2103] Look what He says there.
[time=2104] This is the will of God.
[time=2105] Your sanctification.
[time=2106] That is that you abstain from sexual immorality that each of you know how to possess His own vessel, your body.
[time=2116] In sanctification and honor, He says not in lustful passion like the Gentiles.
[time=2122] Number two, consider, oh please my friends, dwell on.
[time=2127] Dwell on and think about, meditate on the eternal danger of lust's promiscuous desires.
[time=2141] Matthew 5, 27, you have heard that it was said, you shall not commit adultery.
[time=2147] But I say to you, Jesus speaking here, that everyone who looks at a woman or every woman that looks at a man,
[time=2157] that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
[time=2167] People say that's just an illustration.
[time=2169] He doesn't really mean that.
[time=2171] No, let me help you out there.
[time=2173] He really means that.
[time=2175] You really have.
[time=2178] Really.
[time=2182] You really have.
[time=2185] We really have committed that.
[time=2190] When in our, yeah, it's serious.
[time=2194] If you're right, so what do you do?
[time=2197] Well if your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out.
[time=2200] Here comes the radical.
[time=2201] Here comes the high bar.
[time=2203] Here comes the do whatever you've got to do.
[time=2206] Roll those sleeves up as far as they will go to guard yourself from this sin.
[time=2211] If your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out.
[time=2213] Throw it from you.
[time=2214] For it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
[time=2221] My friends dwell on the eternal danger of lust's promiscuous desires.
[time=2227] Number three, preach to yourself.
[time=2229] Say to yourself, meditate internally.
[time=2232] Put it on a card.
[time=2234] Have it in the bathroom, your bedroom, in the car.
[time=2237] Preach to yourself that there is more joy and pleasure in God's presence than in sin's presence.
[time=2245] Anybody want to say amen?
[time=2247] It's really, really true.
[time=2252] Psalm 4-7.
[time=2255] Psalm 4-7 says you have, listening.
[time=2258] Psalmist says you, God, not them, not it, whatever your it may be.
[time=2268] The psalmist says you have put gladness in my heart.
[time=2272] More than when they're grain and new wine abound.
[time=2277] Grain and new wine simply metaphor for the things out there in the world that they want to offer your heart.
[time=2284] Jesus says no, no, you have put gladness in my heart, not those things.
[time=2289] Psalm 16, Psalm 16-11.
[time=2292] You will make known to me the path of life.
[time=2295] In your presence is fullness of joy.
[time=2297] In your right hand, there are, what's that word say?
[time=2302] Pleasures.
[time=2304] And oh, how I know you're all about, we're all about the pleasures in life.
[time=2309] And there is the great truth.
[time=2311] There is the great reminder, pleasures forever in his right hand.
[time=2317] Realize, number four, realize that lust disables and weakens our capacity to enjoy God to the fullest.
[time=2329] Mark 19, Mark 4-19.
[time=2332] But the worries of the world, listen church, but the worries of the world and the deceitfulness of riches
[time=2340] and the desires for other things in or in and choke the Word.
[time=2349] And it becomes the Word, the truth in you choked out, shoved to the side, depleted and diminished.
[time=2361] When you give yourself to the other stuff, he wants the Word implanted, giving you joy
[time=2369] and giving you fullness of life.
[time=2373] Oh, please realize that lust disables and weakens our capacity to enjoy God to the fullest.
[time=2382] I did this first hour, I'll do it second hour, just a real honest, transparent little moment and a chance for all of us to pretty much, I think, probably conclude the same thing.
[time=2392] If you'd be willing to raise your hand if there's ever been a season in your life as a believer,
[time=2401] a season in your life when you lived in a lot of darkness where you made some really bad choices.
[time=2409] Thanks, my hand's up too.
[time=2413] And I'll just invite you briefly, we won't dwell on it, but I will invite you briefly to just remember what that was like.
[time=2421] Now, raise your hand if there's ever been a season in your life as a believer when you lived
[time=2429] in a really clean, honest, faithful, not perfect, but a really clean and honest and healthy relationship with God,
[time=2438] where there was obedience and your life was characterized by a real devotion to him and not what was dark.
[time=2444] Raise your hand if you've lived in that kind of place with the Lord before for weeks or months, yeah, good.
[time=2449] So, just the obvious, but I hope helpful, question which one was better, right?
[time=2457] Which one was better?
[time=2459] You know what the answer is, I know what the answer is.
[time=2463] Which one was fuller?
[time=2465] Which one not only felt better but was better?
[time=2470] Which one was fruitful?
[time=2473] Which one had kingdom impact?
[time=2476] Which one brought joy to your heart?
[time=2479] Which one of those two blessed others?
[time=2482] You with me?
[time=2486] Not even close.
[time=2489] Number five, don't ask.
[time=2491] Don't ask.
[time=2492] We sow many times when we do this.
[time=2495] Don't ask, is it really that big a deal?
[time=2505] I'm just going to go over here and do this.
[time=2511] It's the wrong question, is it that big a deal?
[time=2513] Instead ask, does it maximize my experience of Christ's power?
[time=2518] Does it maximize my enjoyment of his relationship?
[time=2522] Does it maximize my reflection to an on-looking world of his great glory?
[time=2528] I have always been from the first day I ever read it years ago in college.
[time=2535] First Corinthians 6, just one chapter over from where we've been.
[time=2539] First Corinthians 6, 12, love this.
[time=2541] All things Paul says, listen, ask the right question.
[time=2545] All things are lawful for me, but not all things are what?
[time=2551] Say it, profitable, do what's profitable, not just permissible.
[time=2559] All things are lawful for me, end of the verse, but I will not be mastered by anything.
[time=2565] Something other than the spirit and word and person of Christ mastering you, it's wrong.
[time=2570] Be mastered by him.
[time=2571] All things are lawful.
[time=2573] Oh yeah, there's a bunch of stuff that's permissible, but that's the wrong question.
[time=2578] Ask yourself the harder question.
[time=2582] Does it maximize my experience, my relationship, and my reflection of Christ?
[time=2588] Number 6, be careful.
[time=2590] Oh, be careful little eyes.
[time=2592] Many of us used to sing the song when we were younger.
[time=2595] Some of us have sang it to our own kids.
[time=2597] Be careful little eyes, what you see.
[time=2600] Avoid, my friends, men and women, young and old.
[time=2605] Avoid with great vigilance unnecessary stimulation.
[time=2613] God's Word says we are to set in a worthless thing before our eyes.
[time=2620] Job 31, Job 31 1, I have made a covenant.
[time=2626] Have you ever made a covenant with your eyes?
[time=2629] Covenant involves two things in God, so you make a covenant.
[time=2634] Job did, I made a covenant with my eyes.
[time=2637] How then could I gaze at a virgin?
[time=2641] Be careful little eyes, what you see.
[time=2643] You know what my friends, it may mean.
[time=2645] Again, back to the part that's on you.
[time=2651] I understand that God works out things.
[time=2653] I understand that God's in control.
[time=2655] I know that God is powerful.
[time=2657] He also says to you, work out your what?
[time=2662] Your salvation.
[time=2665] And so, it may entail you turning it off.
[time=2671] It may entail you turning your head.
[time=2675] You know what?
[time=2676] It might entail you throwing it out the window.
[time=2680] It may entail you just storing it in the garage for six months.
[time=2686] It may mean you sell it.
[time=2694] It may mean running.
[time=2696] It may mean hiding.
[time=2698] It may mean you doing whatever you have to do.
[time=2704] To vigilantly avoid what happens when you and I set our eyes on things.
[time=2713] And so my hope and my prayer for you is that you would be bold and that you would be courageous and that you would be honest.
[time=2721] Lastly, Adam, why don't you come and we're going to sing a song of confession this morning.
[time=2726] We're going to just collectively as a family bring whatever needs to be brought in our hearts and our spirits before God.
[time=2733] But the last one memorize, all my friends memorize, many, many scriptures.
[time=2740] The Psalmist said that he hid God's word in his heart, Psalm 11911.
[time=2746] He said he hid God's word in his heart so that he wouldn't what?
[time=2751] You understand that's how that works, right?
[time=2754] There really is a correlation between the degree to which the word of God is flowing through your mind because you've hit it there.
[time=2764] You've read it and you've read it and you've memorized it and you've thought about it.
[time=2769] It really does correlate but stand with me this morning as I read this last verse.
[time=2774] I've been waiting all day to read this to you.
[time=2777] Wow.
[time=2778] Memorize many, many scriptures, my friends and your fight against sin.
[time=2781] Look what it says in 1 John 2, 1 John 2, 14.
[time=2786] We got that one?
[time=2788] All right, let me read this to you.
[time=2790] As Adam plays, I want you to see what it says.
[time=2795] This is so encouraging.
[time=2799] 1 John 2, 14.
[time=2803] It says, "I have written to you fathers because you know him.
[time=2807] You know him who has been from the beginning." Now watch this.
[time=2811] "I have written to you young men because you are strong.
[time=2819] And the word of God abides in you and you have overcome the evil one."
[time=2827] Do you see that?
[time=2829] They overcome the evil one because the word of God is in them and when the word of God is in them, it says they are strong.
[time=2839] And oh, I hope that for you and for me a strength that comes in this fight against sin.
[time=2847] A strength that has its foundations and the mighty and strong and the beautiful, powerful word of God. Amen.
[time=2856] [MUSIC]
[time=2864] We are our hearts.
[time=2870] Oh, spirit, call me this alone.
[time=2877] We turn our hearts from evil things.
[time=2883] Oh, we can't stand our eyes.
[time=2887] So give us clean hands and give us pure hearts.
[time=2894] Let us end our lives on souls to another.
[time=2900] Give us clean hands and give us pure hearts.
[time=2907] Let us end our lives on souls to another.
[time=2913] Oh, God, let us be in generation that seeks and seeks your faith.
[time=2922] Oh, God, our take up.
[time=2926] Oh, God, let us be in generation that seeks and seeks your faith.
[time=2935] So, God, let us change.
[time=2944] We are our hearts.
[time=2947] We've been on these.
[time=2950] Oh, spirit, call me this alone.
[time=2957] We turn our hearts from evil things.
[time=2963] Oh, Lord, we can't stand our idols.
[time=2967] So give us clean hands and give us pure hearts.
[time=2974] Let us end our lives on souls to another.
[time=2980] Give us clean hands and give us pure hearts.
[time=2987] Let us end our lives on souls to another.
[time=2993] Oh, God, let us be in generation that seeks and seeks your faith.
[time=3015] So, God, let us change.
[time=3032] That's well done.
[time=3043] Clean hands and a pure heart.
[time=3045] And it sure sounded good and was good to be together with you all on this front this morning and I can't wait to keep walking together.
[time=3054] I'm going to ask Keith and Catherine Moore and their family, any of their family that are with them.
[time=3060] I'm going to ask them to come up on stage.
[time=3063] We're transitioning here on our staff a little bit.
[time=3067] Keith has been, as many of you know, Keith has been an anchor around here, a huge influence and a great encouragement to our family.
[time=3076] And really to our staff, our leadership.
[time=3079] He has been an incredible source of wisdom and example.
[time=3084] And he and Catherine have been that for us as a family and they're not going anywhere, just transitioning out of his day-to-day duties on the visitation front.
[time=3095] Come on in, guys. Come on the rug here.
[time=3098] Keith started here at Blackhawk about when I did.
[time=3103] What do we say as senior pastor? About 15 years.
[time=3107] Yeah, for 15 years, Keith has been bedside at the hospital. Keith has been bringing communion to people in their homes who are bedridden.
[time=3115] Keith has been greeting parents when babies have been born. Keith's been in nursing homes.
[time=3121] Keith has faithfully cared for and loved and ministered to this family.
[time=3127] But it's not just the 15 years here. Keith has been in ministry for over 61 years.
[time=3137] Over 61 years.
[time=3140] Keith, and there's some pictures on the screen as we think.
[time=3148] I don't know if I missed a few already, but there's some pictures on the screen of the early days.
[time=3152] And these two and the life that they've had and the ministry that they've shared over 61 years of ministry, my friends over 65 years of marriage.
[time=3165] And I'm so grateful for the two. I know you can clap. Go right ahead.
[time=3172] There's a great shot right there.
[time=3176] Kathryn, is that you? Is that you? It's not your sister.
[time=3183] Oh my goodness.
[time=3185] I don't need to stand here and tell you that 65 years of marriage and 61 years of ministry is a rarity.
[time=3194] And it's something that just doesn't happen every day.
[time=3196] And so while they're not going anywhere, I just we wanted to thank Keith for his years.
[time=3203] Kathryn as well for their 15 years of service here.
[time=3206] I'm still going to have Keith. I'm still asking him to help me with some things.
[time=3210] I'm still going to take him on some visits.
[time=3212] But it's a time in his life where he is going to continue to increase his care and his love and his time with his wife and his family.
[time=3220] And the family, much of the family is here. Connie, would you just use that?
[time=3224] Oh, you want to have Keith? Okay, sorry. Keith?
[time=3226] He's got a better memory than I do.
[time=3227] Okay, Keith, introduce just real quick. Give us the names of the folks who are here standing up here with you.
[time=3231] I would like to say, Pastor, we do have 27 grandchildren, eight great grandchildren.
[time=3236] We've had seven children, so we pray for them every week.
[time=3240] We start on Sunday with the oldest and end up on Saturday with the youngest.
[time=3245] Wow. I know the name of all of them.
[time=3247] Go for it. Tell us who some of these folks are.
[time=3249] This is our daughter Connie and her husband.
[time=3252] Yeah, yeah, okay.
[time=3254] He just said he knew his kids.
[time=3257] Yeah, you know, some time. And our daughter Christine and her daughter Anne Catherine.
[time=3262] Okay. And our daughter Cozette and our daughter Kay.
[time=3267] And this is Connie's family here. You know Caleb and Cassie.
[time=3273] Oh, Anne Catherine, did I get you? I got you.
[time=3277] Caleb and Cassie and one of our little grandchildren here, a great-grandchild, Lee Avond.
[time=3282] Yes. And then Michaela and Rochelle, Connie's children.
[time=3287] Fantastic. You did fantastic. Absolutely.
[time=3290] Say just a few things about your time here and then we're going to go.
[time=3294] Yes, I do want to thank the Lord for the opportunity of serving here.
[time=3299] And Pastor has been such a support to us and to our family and to me.
[time=3304] I remember when I came, I asked Connie if there'd be any job here or any work, like she said, "Dad, they're all full. I'm sure there's nothing." Well, at that time, the man who was doing the visitation resigned and he asked if I would like to do it
[time=3318] and Pastor didn't hire me to do the visitation.
[time=3321] So, but I appreciate the pastoral staff and appreciate the board that they've been so supportive in our ministry.
[time=3328] We thank the Lord. And I say our ministry because she's as much a part of it as I am, and you know that.
[time=3333] Absolutely. And so we're grateful, Pastor, for all you've done.
[time=3336] You've been a wonderful support and we have loved every part of it. Thank you.
[time=3340] Thank you very much, Keith.
[time=3342] Hey, just to be clear, and I'm just to be clear and I'm thankful how clear Keith has been with this.
[time=3350] He's taken notes over all these years, and I want you to know this morning that he's been faithful.
[time=3357] And when I say that, there have been in the last 15 years 2,363 hospital visits,
[time=3364] 1,902 home and nursing home visits for a total of 4,265 visits over these years and 74 funerals.
[time=3375] It's awesome.
[time=3379] So, you want to say something?
[time=3384] Yeah, I want to say something.
[time=3386] Are you going to hold this for me?
[time=3388] Yeah, I will.
[time=3389] All right. You know, when this man asked me to marry him, I told him I was going in children's work.
[time=3400] And you know what he said? I'll take care of it.
[time=3404] And you did. Yes, he did.
[time=3409] But I know I say thank you. I feel like you're my son.
[time=3415] I love you and your family.
[time=3417] We love you too.
[time=3418] And I pray God's blessing up on you, and I'm so happy to see you wear a tie today.
[time=3426] I did it. I did it for you. I did it for you.
[time=3430] Hey, would you all just extend your hand?
[time=3433] Come on, family, come in here around Keith and Catherine, and would you all just extend your hands toward the stage?
[time=3438] And I want to just lead us in a prayer of blessing on these two, a prayer of thanks.
[time=3442] And I know as I pray, I pray what I know is in your hearts.
[time=3445] Our Father in Heaven, we are so thankful this morning for Keith and for Catherine Moore.
[time=3451] Grateful God for their family as well.
[time=3454] And we're grateful God for the strength and the courage and the wisdom that you have given them over all these years, the lives that they have touched, the families that they've impacted, God, the truth that they have taught and stood for, the love that they've given.
[time=3468] God, the miles that they have walked with others through life.
[time=3473] And God, we know there's more still to come.
[time=3475] And we pray that as they go forward, you would give them a great sense, a great sense of your pleasure and your favor.
[time=3483] May we as a family give them a great sense of our pleasure and our favor and our gratitude for them.
[time=3489] And may their faithfulness be a reminder to each and every one of us.
[time=3494] God, we know that they have experienced difficult times.
[time=3498] God, we know that there has been heartache.
[time=3500] We know that they have experienced the difficulty of marriage and family and ministry.
[time=3506] And yet here, 65 and 61 years later, they stand.
[time=3512] And so God, may we stand as well.
[time=3514] May we walk on the path that they have paved for each and every one of us.
[time=3520] Thank you for them.
[time=3521] Thank you for their love for you.
[time=3523] And may as they continue to follow after you, may we do all that we can to love and support them.
[time=3529] And everybody in the room agreed with the prayer and said amen.
[time=3533] God bless you guys.
[time=3534] We'll see you next week.
[time=3535] [AMEN]
