[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=31] Well, hey, good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=35] It's great to have you here with us again for our weekly broadcast.
[time=39] I'm so grateful for our team of volunteers and staff that make this broadcast possible.
[time=45] And I'm so thankful for each and every one of you.
[time=48] And I want to take just a couple of minutes this morning and ask you to do something that every once in a while I ask you to do, those of you who are a part of our broadcast family.
[time=58] And what I want you to do really stems from this time around, it stems from the fact that this week, I think it's this week I have a meeting coming up with a family from Columbia City.
[time=71] It looks as if I'm going to have the privilege of baptizing.
[time=75] There are two kids.
[time=77] And the interesting thing is I get to baptize kids often.
[time=81] That in and of itself is special, but what makes this situation really unique is that I'm going to meet with this family this week.
[time=88] I'm going to baptize these kids.
[time=89] I think this coming August at our outdoor baptism.
[time=92] And I've never met these kids.
[time=94] I've never met this family face to face.
[time=97] That's right.
[time=98] I never have been with them.
[time=99] I'll meet them for the first time this week.
[time=101] And yet we have a 10 year relationship through the Bible Hour broadcast.
[time=107] We have a relationship that's as close as it gets.
[time=110] We have a spiritual bond.
[time=112] And we have a level of trust and a position of leadership and humility that's growing
[time=121] and learning.
[time=122] We have all the dynamics of a pastor and people in his church.
[time=127] And these folks have watched the broadcast week after week after week, month after month for years.
[time=134] And now they're realizing it's time to take some steps forward.
[time=138] And who do they call?
[time=139] They call us.
[time=140] They call me.
[time=141] And I'm so excited to meet them and so grateful that I'm going to get to have a part in their spiritual progress, their journey.
[time=149] Such a huge thing, baptism.
[time=151] And we get to share in it because of their part in our lives and our part in their lives
[time=157] through this thing we call the Bible Hour.
[time=159] So I want to ask you this.
[time=161] If you are a Bible Hour viewer, if you're part of our broadcast family and your life has been encouraged, you've been changed and grown, the Spirit of God and the Word of God
[time=173] through this broadcast has done great things in your life.
[time=177] If you have found hope, if our broadcast and our relationship with you is something that
[time=183] you have over the years or months really relied on and looked to for help and hope, I want
[time=192] to ask you to write us a letter.
[time=193] I want to ask you to send us an email.
[time=195] I want you to give us a call.
[time=197] However it is, you might feel led to communicate with us.
[time=200] We'd love to hear from you.
[time=202] There's an email address on the bottom here.
[time=205] It's mine.
[time=206] And I'd love to just personally hear from you.
[time=208] Our church phone number is on the bottom of the screen as well.
[time=212] And we would love to know how the broadcast has over time been an encouragement to you.
[time=217] We're so glad we get to bring it each week.
[time=220] We're thankful for this family in Columbia City and thousands and thousands of other families
[time=226] and individuals just like you.
[time=228] And we'd love to hear what God has done through these efforts.
[time=231] So give us a shout.
[time=232] Let us know how you're doing.
[time=233] Let us know how the broadcast has encouraged you.
[time=236] And we'll look forward to just basking in the joy and thankfulness.
[time=242] I know that we'll feel for what God has done in your life.
[time=245] God bless you.
[time=246] As always, we hope to see you soon.
[time=249] Have a great, great week.
[time=276] Oh, my soul, worship His holy name.
[time=283] It seems like never before.
[time=287] Oh, my soul, worship your holy name.
[time=297] My rich in love slowly.
[time=299] Your rich in love and the slow too.
[time=304] And you sing.
[time=306] Your name is the lady of all this kind.
[time=312] Oh, my soul.
[time=316] Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
[time=330] And bless the Lord, all my soul.
[time=336] Oh, my soul, worship His holy name.
[time=342] It seems like never before.
[time=346] Oh, my soul, worship your holy name.
[time=355] Are you singing on that day?
[time=358] Yeah, on that day.
[time=361] He crossed me by light of still my soul.
[time=373] Oh, my soul, worship His holy name.
[time=401] It seems like never before.
[time=405] Oh, my soul, worship your holy name.
[time=411] It seems like never before.
[time=417] Oh, my soul, worship your holy name.
[time=431] All right, this is a song you may not have heard before.
[time=437] It's really simple.
[time=439] It says, "Thank you for loving me.
[time=441] Thank you for hearing me.
[time=446] And then thank you for saving me." I just want to really focus on this thing this morning.
[time=451] Think of the ways that God has loved you and maybe you didn't feel like you were lovable.
[time=456] Maybe the things that have been in the depths of your heart that no one else could really hear and understand that God has heard and understood.
[time=466] Maybe those hurts, those ones that you have that only God could heal.
[time=473] And then finally, just the way that only God can save us, right?
[time=478] All right, it goes like this.
[time=480] Thank you for loving me.
[time=507] Are you and me hearing me?
[time=509] Thank you for hearing me. Thank you for hearing me. Thank you for hearing me. Thank you for hearing me.
[time=580] Thank you for saving me. Thank you for saving me. Thank you for saving me.
[time=625] What happiness for those whose guilt has been forgiven, what joys when sins are covered over, what relief for those who have confessed their sins and God has cleared their record.
[time=646] There was a time when I wouldn't admit what a sin or I was, but my dishonesty made me miserable and filled my days with frustration.
[time=654] All day and all my, your hand was heavy on me. My strength evaporated like water on a sunny day until I finally admitted all my sins to you and stopped trying to hide them.
[time=666] I said to myself, I will confess unto the Lord and you forgave me all my guilt has gone.
[time=673] So grateful for the chance to sing, so grateful for Adam, grateful for the opportunity to sing great truth to read and see the great truth that was on the screen.
[time=687] What a privilege for us as a family and I'm so thankful that you are here grateful that we could do this together and thankful we can do what we're about to do together open up the Word of God.
[time=697] And I hope be encouraged and challenged and convicted and helped in the way that only the Word of God can do this.
[time=704] So if you have your Bibles or you're following along on your phone or your iPad, however it is, that you're viewing the Scriptures.
[time=711] Would you open up this morning to First Corinthians as we continue in our ongoing study of Paul's two letters to the church at Corinth.
[time=721] This morning we come to First Corinthians chapter seven and First Corinthians chapter eight and the clearly stated themes of marriage in chapter seven.
[time=734] Marriage in chapter seven and eating meat offered to idols.
[time=740] Sounds a little weird, I know, but bear with me, I'll explain that to you here in due time.
[time=746] But marriage in chapter seven and eating meat offered to idols.
[time=750] Marriage and meat this morning.
[time=753] And while I'm going to share with you some very important biblical principles from both chapters, principles having to do with honoring God in your marriage and being careful when it comes to your freedoms.
[time=765] We will spend time looking at both sections while we will glean, I hope, great truth from both parts of this letter.
[time=774] Chapter seven and verse eight while we will look at both of them, there is one common truth in both.
[time=784] One very important theme that runs like a thread right through the heart, right through the middle of both chapters.
[time=794] I can't wait to get to the end of our talk here this morning and see if you can figure out on your own even what that one overarching principle is that we can take with us and hold on to this week from our close look and our interaction and dialogue over these two chapters in First Corinthians.
[time=813] And remember friends, that is the purpose of this.
[time=816] The whole reason we do this isn't to hear a guy talk.
[time=822] The whole reason we come together isn't just to sing songs.
[time=826] The reason we do this is so that we can with our best effort give to you the life changing truth of God's word so that you can take it and hang on to it and think about it.
[time=840] And allow it to come into not just your mind but the everyday of your life.
[time=845] Our hope is that this is about you and I being doers of God's word.
[time=851] We hope Sunday has relevance in your life on Thursday.
[time=857] We hope this is something that can help you and encourage you and I believe with all of my heart that what you're going to hear today really could help you and really could encourage you and really can give us great guidance.
[time=868] So let's jump in if we can.
[time=872] Let's start with what the Bible here in Paul's letter to the church at Corinth in chapter 7 says about a marriage that honors God.
[time=881] And right out of the gates Paul speaks to the issue of the physical relationship between a husband and a wife.
[time=891] The physical relationship between a husband and a wife.
[time=897] Let me just read to you what it says in chapter 7 verse 3.
[time=900] The husband must fulfill his duty to his wife and likewise also the wife to her husband.
[time=911] More on that obviously in just a second but I do want to take just a minute here this morning.
[time=917] As you see in God's word there those two phrases husband and wife.
[time=926] My mind goes to some of what we saw transpiring this week even right here locally it's obviously been an issue that we've seen transpiring for quite some time even on a national level.
[time=940] But I got a lot of phone calls this week got a lot of people asking me questions along the lines of how Kelly are you going to respond or how do we respond to this issue of same sex marriage or same sex unions.
[time=958] And anybody who's been around here for any length of time knows that I really don't we don't make it a practice of stepping into political discussions but I want to make sure you all understand that at its foundation this isn't a political discussion.
[time=976] And I want to make sure we all understand that we have been known the church and maybe not you or maybe not me but I want to just make sure we all understand that we have been known the church has been known for years for not handling those discussions very well.
[time=1000] And I want to just try just for a few minutes this morning just give you a couple things this is by no means an exhaustive treatment of this but we come this morning to a passage on marriage between a husband and a wife.
[time=1013] And I want to just make sure that there are some things we're thinking about some things that we're considering as you have and as I have opportunity to respond in whatever forum be it public or private in whatever setting we would have the chance to respond.
[time=1029] I want to make sure that we're guiding you and giving you some things to consider in the process first of all I want to just say this I don't believe it's a political issue I believe it is two things I believe it is a design.
[time=1042] Bear with me here I believe it is a divine design issue and I believe it is an authority issue and I'm going to just give you a couple things to think about along those lines, a design issue and a and a divine authority issue.
[time=1059] Design here's what I mean by design I'm out there with Jake yesterday at our place and any time spent with me at our place that includes the use of what we would call tools or equipment is always a really interesting encounter.
[time=1078] I am not skilled in those things I can stand and talk in front of hundreds of people but the weed wacker thing with the string you know the plastic thing that goes around and around and cuts all the weeds down.
[time=1092] There wasn't any in the weed wacker and Jake brings me the package it's all wound up in a circle you guys are all laughing with me.
[time=1098] It's all wound up in a circle inside he said so no problem Jake I got it.
[time=1103] So I figure out that you can unscrew the bottom of the weed wacker right not your heads you're with me and then you take that twine that plastic stuff and you can see and then you can wrap it around inside that thing so I wrap it around and real quick pop it in.
[time=1117] You pull the thing out the little hole on the side plug that thing in you're ready to roll well it takes about two minutes and all of a sudden I'm woo wooing and the entire you know three feet of twine I put in there comes flying out of the thing.
[time=1134] So I realize we have a design issue there is and while I'm making light of me and the weed wacker please hear me I'm not making design of I'm not making light of what we're talking about here.
[time=1150] There's a way that that works you have to I figured it out you have to wrap it in a way where it stays wrapped so if you have some struggles with that come and talk to me I'm an expert on it right now I can help you.
[time=1166] There's a way that works Genesis 2 says that God made them both man and woman.
[time=1178] That's how God designed that.
[time=1181] He made man and he made woman and he made them differently and he brought them together and he called the union if you want to use that word it's fine.
[time=1194] He called that union husband and wife he called that union marriage.
[time=1200] He made the woman in such a way and he made the man in such a way that even physically they complimented each other in that union and that's how God designed it.
[time=1212] He's God he can do that and this is what he gave us he gave us this design for marriage a man and a woman and so what and I understand it I do.
[time=1227] What some want to do and what some are trying to do and even governmentally what some would say they're even being successful at doing is they're trying to redefine the design.
[time=1239] And yeah and there are some who from their perspective would say it's working and I will just you're saying well Kelly what are you going to say well what I'm going to say is I'm going to keep saying what this says.
[time=1253] And I'm going to keep saying not only what this says but what I've watched in 26 years of life and ministry that the design of God for the union of marriage between a man and a woman works on a lot of fronts.
[time=1268] And other attempts at somehow doing that outside of his design don't.
[time=1277] And so the design issue is important there's also the authority issue my friends and here's what I mean by authority had a conversation just a few weeks ago with a young lady on this issue.
[time=1291] I was honored to have the discussion I was very grateful for her openness and her transparency.
[time=1297] She was coming kind of from the other side of this discussion and she wasn't coming at me in disrespect she wasn't coming at me in anger she was literally trying to figure out these things that she had been wrestling with for years.
[time=1313] And she said to me she said you have no idea what it's like to from the earliest days of my life she said that I can remember.
[time=1327] She said I've had this urge I've had this bent these are her words I've had this leaning and it didn't feel even when I was a little girl she said it didn't feel right.
[time=1341] And then as I grew up I could certainly see how maybe it wasn't but it was from the earliest times I can remember.
[time=1348] She says I began to feel this leaning toward a homosexual lifestyle.
[time=1356] I've had recent conversations with other individuals even just about a month ago I could I can tell you about a conversation where an individual began to recount for me the utter and absolute dysfunction of their home growing up.
[time=1370] A mother that was that was this and a dad that that was this and and the dysfunction that came from that and the turmoil that erupted and the insecurity that it caused and the strategies that began to circulate in a little 10, 12, 14 year old heart that ended up one day sort of looking like this.
[time=1393] And that individual looking at me going it's just it's now it's like who I am or or now it's just what I feel like I've got to do or want to do and and both of them and countless others for years have said to me on this front.
[time=1411] They've said now you I know would have no idea what that's like.
[time=1418] And I want to make sure that you all hear me say this I know exactly what that's like.
[time=1429] From the youngest days I can remember of my own life.
[time=1442] I've seen certain patterns in me going back as far as I can remember that when it all shook out at the end of the day I realized weren't good.
[time=1454] Weren't what God wanted. What I sensed in me as a young boy in some of the struggles of my early life while it might look outwardly different than this dear individual who sat with me in my office just a few weeks ago while it might look different.
[time=1469] Oh I know exactly what it's like to from the earliest days of your life struggle with things that you know aren't good.
[time=1479] I know a little bit about dysfunction in a home. I know the strategies that get developed.
[time=1484] Oh no no you're not talking about anything I don't understand.
[time=1488] See what I want to make sure you all hear me saying what I want to make sure we're all realizing here is that on this issue of homosexuality same-sex union whatever you want to call it or on the issue of greed or on the issue of gluttony.
[time=1503] Or on the issue of immorality or on the issue of pride or on the issue of gossip.
[time=1509] I hope all of you can identify with doing what you know is wrong with struggling from maybe early on with things outside of what God has designed.
[time=1526] And it really isn't though sometimes in the church we want to make this issue out to be kind of a separate one it's not and what it boils down to is this so all that to make one point.
[time=1536] You can struggle with whatever you struggle with. I understand.
[time=1543] Okay we all have to still though come under the authority of God and his word and whatever your struggle looks like for whatever reason you got there.
[time=1557] My heart breaks. My heart breaks for you. I hope yours breaks for me because whatever the struggle is and however it is we got there we still have to all be willing to come under.
[time=1569] Come under what God's design and authority lead us to. Not your heads if that makes any sense at all.
[time=1576] Yeah somebody said are they welcomed here.
[time=1582] I said of course they're welcomed here.
[time=1585] I said I said you're welcomed here.
[time=1590] And I'm your pastor. You want to see the list I just wrote down that Adam had me.
[time=1597] Are they welcome of course they're welcome here.
[time=1600] We're going to have trouble I'll take you back to last week's message you and I are going to have trouble.
[time=1605] If you decide you're going to practice your sin you're going to have trouble with me.
[time=1611] If I start to practice my sin and move away from accountability amen.
[time=1617] So you can come anybody can come.
[time=1620] And if you're going to profess Christ we're going to hold you to the Word of God and do our very best to encourage you not to practice the fallenness that resides in you whatever that might look like.
[time=1635] And you're not going to see me somebody said why don't you march more. I'm not a marcher. I'm a pastor.
[time=1641] You say why don't you say more why don't you know I'm like I teach the Word of God and I try to lead this family to live out the truth of what it means to follow Jesus and if we do that I think we got it covered amen.
[time=1654] All right so back to 1 Corinthians 7 husband and wife is what he made.
[time=1661] And what we see here in chapter 7 is that right out of the gate Paul speaks to the issue of the physical relationship and he clearly lays out in 7, 3 to 5.
[time=1670] That in a marriage that honors God let me read this to you 7, 3 to 5.
[time=1674] Husband must fulfill his duty to his wife likewise also the wife to her husband.
[time=1679] The wife in verse 4 the wife does not have authority over her own body but the husband does.
[time=1685] And likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does stop depriving each other except by agreement for a time so that you may devote yourselves to prayer
[time=1699] and then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self control.
[time=1707] So here you go let's talk about this and again we love having the kids in here and so I get to do this in kind of PG, PG style how am I doing.
[time=1715] PG style here we go number one in a God honoring marriage in a marriage that honors God yes is the normative answer.
[time=1725] Yes is the normative answer on the physical front.
[time=1730] Willing and open is the normative posture.
[time=1734] In a godly marriage there is no pattern ongoing pattern of depriving or withholding is what God's word says.
[time=1742] Now obviously there are times when you can't and in some circumstances times when you shouldn't but God's word makes it clear that the normative attitude,
[time=1752] the normative pattern between a husband and a wife, a man and a woman on this front should be more lets than lets not.
[time=1762] Should be more yes than no.
[time=1766] Now as you all saw in the passage as we read through it the husband in God's design, the husband or wife or both may commit to a time of prayer and fasting in their life.
[time=1777] This isn't a bad idea this is actually a spiritual discipline that really probably more of us should be engaged in in the everyday of our lives as we follow after the ways of Jesus.
[time=1791] A time of absolute spiritual focus in the day to day of their lives and as part of a season, a brief time of spiritual focus or fasting they may agree to stop a number of things in their life.
[time=1806] Being together physically might be one of them but the passage makes it clear here that this is to be brief, not ongoing.
[time=1815] No coming home announcing a five year fast.
[time=1820] God's word here in 1 Corinthians 7 says don't put your spouse in that dangerous, difficult position.
[time=1828] This is to be temporary, never indefinite.
[time=1832] And I'll put this on the screen.
[time=1834] I wondered if I should put this on the screen during the week as I thought about it because of what kind of comes with this statement but then I just thought you know what I'm going to put it on the screen.
[time=1844] And then we're going to deal with what comes with it because this statement here is really true.
[time=1849] Deprivation leads to temptation.
[time=1852] That's true.
[time=1854] It just does.
[time=1856] Deprivation on this front can lead to temptation and please understand we're not just talking about depriving him or her of the mere act.
[time=1868] We're talking about all that comes or should come with the act, the warmth and the proximity and the kindness and the verbals and the non-verbals and the mutual, clear communication of love, readiness and availability.
[time=1883] One of you keeps all of that and the act itself away from the other, things can get sideways quickly because that's not God's, what, design.
[time=1899] The string around, I think, she's going to come out.
[time=1902] It's not going to work, doesn't work.
[time=1906] That's not how God designed it.
[time=1909] Now, here's why I struggled to put it on the screen and I'm going to just have you look with me again in your Bibles.
[time=1916] However you're viewing the Scriptures, look at James, Hebrews, James.
[time=1923] Look at James chapter one.
[time=1925] I want to read this to you.
[time=1929] And before I read it, I'll just say this.
[time=1931] I'll just say this.
[time=1932] Listen, all eyes up here.
[time=1934] Deprivation can lead to temptation.
[time=1938] But please hear me, there is a difference.
[time=1942] There's a difference between temptation and sin.
[time=1950] Deprivation can lead to temptation.
[time=1953] She or he may conduct themselves in a way on this front that might lead to deprivation.
[time=1960] That's real.
[time=1961] Might lead to temptation.
[time=1964] Hey, what you do with the temptation is up to who?
[time=1972] You.
[time=1974] And if you don't handle the temptation in a godly way and you end up, what, sinning?
[time=1981] Who's to blame for the sin?
[time=1984] You or her or him?
[time=1988] I'll just give you the answer.
[time=1990] You.
[time=1993] And I can't tell you how many times we've come along people in the mess of sin over here.
[time=1999] And it gets thrown back over here because he or she didn't do this or didn't provide that.
[time=2006] This is like I had to go and do.
[time=2009] Really?
[time=2011] No.
[time=2013] Another person's actions or another person's attitudes are never, are never the root of your sin.
[time=2021] Look at James.
[time=2023] I love what it says here in James 1.
[time=2025] Just good for you and I to be reminded of this verse 13.
[time=2027] Let no one say when he is being tempted, I'm being tempted by, in this case, God.
[time=2031] For God cannot be tempted by evil and he himself does not tempt anyone.
[time=2035] Okay, listen, verse 14.
[time=2037] But each one is tempted when he or she is carried away and enticed by his or her own lust.
[time=2047] Yours.
[time=2048] Not theirs.
[time=2049] Then when lust has conceived, when you've given it air and when you've given it water and when
[time=2056] you've given it just the right circumstance, it gives birth to sin because of what you did and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death.
[time=2069] So you clear on that?
[time=2072] Sin is yours.
[time=2074] Temptation, my friends, you are on the hook.
[time=2079] If you're depriving in a way that's outside of what God would have ordained, if you're depriving you, you're on the hook for the temptation.
[time=2089] And that's something that you would want to, we would want to obviously have you deal with.
[time=2094] Last thing on this, and we'll move on, if there is a reluctance in the physical arena,
[time=2101] you and your spouse, as you look at this, as you've experienced this over the months
[time=2107] or years, if there is a reluctance, if there's some withholding going on, I want to encourage
[time=2115] you, the one who's kind of experiencing that, I want to encourage you from the bottom of my heart to not demand but deal.
[time=2127] Deal with it.
[time=2128] You don't demand it like it's your right.
[time=2131] You don't power up and go high authority and say, "No, no, no, no." Kelly said, "No, if there's something going on there and there is a reluctance, I believe it's incumbent upon you as a loving spouse, whether you're the husband or the wife, to try and figure out why.
[time=2150] To talk about it, to get help, to seek counsel, to be genuine and gentle and sincere and just
[time=2156] try and figure out what's transpiring, maybe it's something about, guess what, you?
[time=2164] Maybe it's something that's gone on over here with her or him, but I bet you, I bet you we could get it figured out.
[time=2171] But the attitude and the spirit needs to be one of willing to come alongside.
[time=2176] Don't demand.
[time=2177] Don't do that.
[time=2178] Deal with it in a loving, honest, careful, gentle way.
[time=2181] Please remember, friends, marriage.
[time=2183] Marriage can be meaningful.
[time=2185] Marriage is succeed when your selfishness dies and thoughtful service toward the other lives.
[time=2197] When your selfishness dies and when thoughtful service toward the other lives, this thing
[time=2205] has a real chance.
[time=2210] It's all about the other.
[time=2213] It's about him, not you.
[time=2217] It's not about you.
[time=2219] I'll never forget being at a conference of 10, 12, 15 years ago and hearing a guy on
[time=2226] marriage get up and say, as he was making this very point, he said, "Okay, listen.
[time=2231] Everybody in the room, just right now, either on a piece of paper or in your mind, make a list of the top five things that are wrong in your marriage, things that if they would just get better, it would make the whole thing better, things that aren't right, things that you wish were different, things that irritate you, things that annoy you, things that break
[time=2251] your heart." Go ahead, he said to the room, "Make a list of five things that are wrong with your marriage and if they would just be addressed, you know it would get better." So he says, "Do that, so I did it and maybe you just did it."
[time=2267] And then he said, "Now, let's look at that list.
[time=2271] How many of those things have absolutely everything to do with you?"
[time=2278] And I was like, "Ah, no."
[time=2285] Because that's not how we work.
[time=2287] Somebody gets up and says that to you and me.
[time=2289] We write a quick list of all the things that are wrong with them.
[time=2296] The list needs to be about you because that's what you can control, because that's what
[time=2303] you can put your effort and your heart and your energy toward you and the things you can do better, the ways you can improve.
[time=2311] You with me?
[time=2313] All about them and our willingness to serve them, be sensitive to them.
[time=2322] Secondly, in a marriage that honors God, you don't leave.
[time=2327] You stay, you work it out.
[time=2329] You don't leave, you stay, you work it out.
[time=2333] And I say this to each and every one of you in the room who finds yourself married today, this is what God's design is for you.
[time=2340] Yes, there are times when due to physical abuse or other forms of abuse or cases of
[time=2346] unrepentant ongoing immorality or instances of abandonment that we can actually help
[time=2354] you separate, because some of those things I just mentioned require that we do that, that
[time=2360] we help you get some distance.
[time=2363] Some of those things God gives you freedom to divorce.
[time=2367] Matthew 19 talks about the unrepentant immoral spouse.
[time=2372] First Corinthians 7 talks about abandonment, let me read this to you.
[time=2376] Go back in your Bibles, maybe you had turned to James, go back to First Corinthians 7.
[time=2382] It says in 1 Corinthians 7, 10, "But to the married, I give instructions not I but the Lord that the wife should not leave her husband, but if she does leave, she must remain unmarried
[time=2393] or else be reconciled to her husband, and that the husband should not divorce his wife.
[time=2399] But to the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever
[time=2405] and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her.
[time=2409] And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to live with her, she must
[time=2415] not send her husband away.
[time=2417] For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife
[time=2424] is sanctified through her believing husband, for otherwise your children are unclean but
[time=2430] now they are holy.
[time=2431] Just a great little explanation there of how when you have an unbeliever and a believer doesn't talk about how they got to that place, we would certainly encourage you not to get
[time=2441] into that place, but if that is your place, there's strong encouragement there to stay
[time=2448] at it, and to be used by God to very possibly reach into the life of that unbelieving spouse
[time=2455] and bring about the process of sanctification, spiritual growth, obviously it would begin with salvation, that can occur, that has happened.
[time=2470] It goes on yet if the unbelieving one, verse 15, yet if the unbelieving one leaves, let
[time=2476] him or her leave.
[time=2479] The brother or sister who has been left behind is not under bondage in such cases, but God
[time=2486] has called us to peace.
[time=2491] People say what does that mean leave?
[time=2492] It just means they're left, they're gone, they're done.
[time=2498] They are down the road, it is over, and that's what gets communicated, and when I say to you
[time=2504] cases of immorality or abandonment, God here in the Word of God gives some freedom for
[time=2511] that thing to be over, but what I want to say to you this morning is okay, we've talked
[time=2518] about those two, but when it comes to the rest and there's a lot, there's a lot of us that live in the rest of the picture, when it comes to the rest of the picture, the rest of life's everyday difficult marital challenges, what do you do?
[time=2534] You get help, what do you do?
[time=2537] You run away from compromise, because believe me, if it's going downhill, the first thing
[time=2544] the enemy is going to do is give you opportunities to compromise.
[time=2547] You get help, you run away from compromise, you seek wisdom, you beg for accountability, you see a biblical counselor, you stay in something that's not very fun, had a gal look
[time=2560] at me recently and tell me she's done, she's finished, it's over, she's found papers, I said why, she goes, it's just not fun anymore, and I thought, wow, what did you sign up for?
[time=2573] Like what flyer did you get?
[time=2577] Who talked you through this thing, fun?
[time=2581] I love marriage, I'm a big proponent of it, it's got huge upsides, days of great joy,
[time=2587] but you know and I know it's hard, amen?
[time=2594] Paul knew it too, Paul knew it was extremely challenging, Paul knew it could be heartbreaking, I told the first hour, can you imagine this getting read at a wedding, here I'll pick
[time=2607] it up and I'll pick it up in 25, go to 725, now concerning virgins, young ladies, or young
[time=2613] men, I have no command of the Lord but I give an opinion as one who by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy, I think then that this is good in view of the present distress, that
[time=2623] it is good for a man or a woman to remain as he or she is, Paul says, if you're not married
[time=2629] don't sweat it, stay that way and move forward, are you bound to a wife or 27, are you bound
[time=2636] to a wife don't seek to be released, are you released from a wife don't seek a wife, but
[time=2642] if you marry you have not sinned and if a virgin marries she has not sinned, but if you get
[time=2648] married yet such will have trouble in this life and I am trying to spare you, can you
[time=2656] see that at a wedding, before you guys say I do, can I just tell you, you know, no but
[time=2667] he's right, you know he's right, I know he's right and here's where the church I believe
[time=2675] in my opinion has just been dismantled by our culture, by worldly philosophy, marriages
[time=2684] have been ruined by this, families have been irrevocably damaged by this, I've seen parenting
[time=2691] hugely set back by this and what's the this, the this is, the this is here it is, it's the worldly, not biblical, it's the worldly notion that above and beyond all else in
[time=2702] life I deserve to be what, say it, happy, I deserve a pain free, heartache free, hassle
[time=2719] free life, it's in our culture, it's in our world, it's in our sinful souls, my feelings,
[time=2726] my fulfillment, my happiness is what matters most and if I'm not happy I quit, that boss
[time=2736] is a jerk I quit, I don't like my friends, I'm not happy with them I quit, I'm not going
[time=2746] to discipline my child because when I discipline him or her they're not happy, I don't want them sad, I want them happy, so we don't discipline, so we leave friends, so we quit
[time=2756] jobs and marriage, oh my goodness, you can laugh and we can snicker, it's not a laughing
[time=2762] snickering matter, it is every day my friends, we hear it all the time, I'm not happy, I'm
[time=2769] happy, it's become this God that we worship, we've got to be happy, alright, so the whole
[time=2782] key to verse 7, I hope you picked it up, the whole key to chapter 7, the brief little
[time=2790] treatment of marriage we just did is that it's not about who? It's not about you. It's about them.
[time=2799] If you're with Him, hey, just real quick here. If you're with Him, I mean, if you're really
[time=2806] with Him, if you're in relationship with Him, if that relationship is growing, if that relationship
[time=2812] is real, if that relationship is daily, if that relationship is devoted, if you're with Him, guess what? He's got you. You're good. There's not a thing your spouse could give you
[time=2826] that compares to what you have with Him. So if you're with Him, you're good. Now just turn
[time=2834] yourself toward Him or her and serve. It's not about you. It's about them. There's chapter 7.
[time=2841] Here's chapter 8 in two minutes. You ready to watch this? And really, it can be done in two minutes.
[time=2845] Meet in the A.T. and your brother. What does Paul say about meet and your brother? So the deal is
[time=2852] this. Some of you know this. Others of you might not. No big deal. I can just tell you right now.
[time=2856] There was in Christian culture in that day, there was this residual mindset from all the legalism
[time=2863] that they had seen and grown up with. There was this idea that there were these things you just
[time=2869] didn't do. And one of the things you just never did was you would never eat meat that had been sacrificed to an idol. Because eating meat that got sacrificed to an idol, somebody said way,
[time=2880] way, way, way back here. That was sinful and that was wrong. And you don't do that. And then the law came along. The law had some prohibitions on that thing as well. And then Jesus comes and
[time=2890] Jesus abolishes the what? Say it. The law. Now there aren't thousands of rules. Now there's two.
[time=2901] Love God. Love each other. There's your rules.
[time=2906] And so when it came to meet, sacrifice to idols and some people feeling great freedom
[time=2916] now, which they had, they were eating it. And those who didn't feel that freedom, they were
[time=2923] still kind of stuck back here in the do's and don'ts, there really was a struggle for them.
[time=2928] So watch this and keep thinking about that thread I told you ran through both chapters.
[time=2933] Says in seven, eight, seven. However, not all men have this knowledge that some of you do,
[time=2939] that now all that's gone in the past, but some don't understand that. Some being accustomed to the idol until now eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol and their conscious being weak is
[time=2950] defiled. But, see Paul knew this and some of the more mature believers knew this, food will not
[time=2957] commend us to God. We're neither the worse if we do not eat nor the better if we do eat.
[time=2962] But take care, church, you mature ones who have your freedoms, take care that this liberty of yours
[time=2974] does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. For someone sees you who has knowledge,
[time=2982] dining in an idols temple will not his conscience if he is weak, be strengthened to eat things
[time=2990] sacrificed to idols. For then, verse 11, through your knowledge he who is weak gets ruined,
[time=2996] the brother for who's sake Christ died. And so by sinning against the brother and wounding their conscience, when it is weak, you, the strong one, end up sinning against Christ. Therefore, if food
[time=3009] causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again so that I will not cause my brother
[time=3015] to stumble. Legalism, what is it? What's legalism? Just think it real quick in your mind. What's
[time=3024] legalism? What's a good definition of a legalistic culture? Legalism. Just think about it real quick
[time=3032] and then I'll just give you a quick answer. Legalism is a list of spiritual do's and don'ts that God
[time=3038] didn't come up with. How's that? It's a list of spiritual do's and don'ts that God didn't come up
[time=3044] with. The whole list of things you're supposed to do to be a spiritually mature obedient person that didn't originate with God, they originated with man. Some of us in this room grew up,
[time=3054] I did in a legalistic culture. I grew up in a culture that said men had to have their hair
[time=3060] a certain length, that if men wore their hair past a certain length it was sinful. I grew up in a
[time=3069] culture, a legalistic culture where you never went to a movie. If you went to a movie you sinned
[time=3075] because movies are sinful and if you go to a movie you're sinful. I grew up in a culture where
[time=3081] playing cards was the work of the devil. You didn't play cards, if you played cards you sinned. You
[time=3088] were sinful if you played cards and you certainly didn't drink because if you drink you're a sinner
[time=3094] because alcohol is sinful. So movies aren't sinful, alcohol is not sinful, long hair isn't
[time=3107] sinful. I'm sorry. God's word doesn't say that. You with me? Now God's word says a lot about those
[time=3117] things that you and I have to take in and exercise wisdom and good sound judgment on.
[time=3123] But when I bump up against those people and I still do what's my posture going to be?
[time=3133] If Adam wants you coming up we're going to sing as we go this morning, a song that really speaks to the posture we should have. And the posture we should have when it comes to
[time=3143] meet sacrifice to idols or you pick the deal, the posture we should have is sensitivity to them.
[time=3150] Colatians 5 says, "Do not hold on to your freedom. Do not allow your freedom
[time=3158] to be an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another." Did you see that?
[time=3165] Galatians 5, 13. That's the posture, a posture of love, a giving up of my right, a giving up of
[time=3172] what I'm allowed to do if in this case, if in this setting it allows me to exercise graciousness
[time=3180] and sensitivity and kindness toward another. It's all about the other, it's not about you.
[time=3188] Marriage, freedoms, both worlds pointed toward a heart that is soft toward others. Let's stand
[time=3196] and let's sing about that posture. I actually would like to invite you this morning, we never
[time=3203] do anything like this, but if you're comfortable, if you're physically able, there's no pressure at all, but just as we sing this song that talks about lifting God high and us bowing down the
[time=3213] I'd like to invite you, if you'd like to take an opportunity to actually go to your knees there in the pew or in the aisle, if not, it's no big deal, but if you'd like to, just as Kelly was
[time=3222] saying, just kind of another way to express that posture then, by all means, as we sing.
[time=3243] You say I lift you high and bow down low.
[time=3273] I lift you high and bow down low. I lift you high and bow down low. I'll I can you be
[time=3287] low can I go? You must increase I must decrease low.
[time=3296] I'll bow down and you will be a door. You must increase, oh you must increase I must decrease
[time=3315] the low. I'll bow down and you will be a door. I do I am bow down low. I can you be low can I
[time=3337] go? I do I am bow down low. I can you be low must increase oh you must increase I must decrease
[time=3354] low. I'll bow down and you will be a door. You must increase oh you must increase I must decrease
[time=3372] low. I'll bow down and you will be a door. I lift you high and bow down low. I can you be
[time=3393] low can I go? I need you high and bow down low. I can you be low can I go?
[time=3409] So, as you leave, we'll oftentimes send you with a greeting. I'll send you with something
[time=3420] and you all say stay I'll say stay strong or I'll say stay faithful. I'll say stay true and those
[time=3427] are all good things and you should stay all those things but today I want to say this to you stay low stay low stay down don't don't get up here this week stay low serve them go out of your way
[time=3446] for them experience hardship it's okay he's got you stay low stay low stay low say it say it one time
[time=3458] stay low oh father in heaven I pray for these these friends of mine this family who I love and I know that there are so many here today
[time=3476] but find themselves in a place where they want out maybe not literally but figuratively
[time=3484] sometimes it feels too hard sometimes the hill seems to steep sometimes the battle just seems like
[time=3492] it's gone on too long and the enemy in our weakness wants to offer us temptation that leads to sin
[time=3502] that leads to death and it doesn't get it doesn't get phrased that way and it certainly doesn't
[time=3509] get pitched that way but god we know that's how that works and so I pray god that you would give
[time=3516] these dear friends and this family of ours that you would give a strength to stay low to be humble
[time=3523] to serve to give to be about others and not ourselves when we trust that you will do great things
[time=3530] through us in that posture oh god please do we pray and everybody in the room agreed with the
[time=3560] you
