[time=416] (applause)
[time=422] My name's Josh Rang.
[time=423] I'm a part of the teaching team with Jesse Hanna and Steve Webster and Kelly Bird.
[time=430] So Steve and Kelly are not here with us today, but they are, I think one of them might be in transit.
[time=436] The other one might be there with the team in India as they're going to continue to minister to as our own and that community and seeing more people, more women rescued, and being free not just from their rescue out of the red light district, but being free because they've come to know their Savior, Jesus.
[time=459] And so they're there and I thought as we start out this morning that we could just pray for that team.
[time=465] So let's do that this morning.
[time=467] Father, thank you for the opportunity that we as a people have to go and minister in your name and proclaim the greatest news of history that you conquered death and sin, that you have covered our sin through your death through the blood that was shed, through your body that was broken, and you conquered death by rising from the dead three days later and you sit at the throne, ruling and reigning.
[time=499] And when we place our faith and trust in you, we get to live in the good of all that you have accomplished for us.
[time=507] So we pray as our team in India goes forth and those that might be ministering, that we don't know of, those on the mission wall, those that are going out, as it says in Romans, how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news?
[time=527] And so I just ask that you would go before them. I ask that your spirit would grant them gifts, clarity of speech that your Holy Spirit would grant gifts of illumination to those that they minister to and that ultimately your name would be praised. Christ's name, we pray these things.
[time=547] Amen. Well, if you have your Bibles turned to 1 Corinthians chapter 12, we're in the midst of a series called Life Together, moving through the book of 1 Corinthians, and we come this morning to verse 1, which simply says, now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. So it's starting a new section as Paul addresses a new topic, and we're talking today about the Holy Spirit's role in the life of the church. Quick background of 1 Corinthians, Paul had ministered to the people of Corinth.
[time=591] He had been there on one of his missionary journeys.
[time=595] He had preached the good news of the gospel. Many people had responded.
[time=599] They started a church and that church was healthy and growing in the midst of a very secular context that that church was in. Paul had left and as he had left several years later he heard reports about what was happening in the Church of Corinth, but also we believe that he received a letter from the church in Corinth asking him questions about how they were supposed to do life together as a church in the body of Christ. And so first and second Corinthians is Paul's response to the believers there in Corinth to not only answer their questions, but to respond to some of the reports that he had heard about their conduct and about their ministry and about their life together.
[time=651] So this morning we come to this new topic, as we've already said, he states it clearly, now concerning spiritual gifts. Now in the days of the Corinthian Church I believe that the use of the spiritual gifts, in fact the desire to be spiritual was somewhat overemphasized. There was an emphasis upon the mystical, upon the spiritual, and so those in the Church of that day probably had what I would call an overemphasis upon the spiritual.
[time=687] I think if we fast forward to today specifically in our current context, specifically here at Blackhawk, I believe that we may be under emphasize the work of the Spirit and the spiritual. And so today my efforts, according to the work of the Spirit by His grace, I want us all to be encouraged this morning by all the things that the Holy Spirit is accomplishing in our Church.
[time=719] What a priceless gift the Holy Spirit is.
[time=723] Jesus said it's better for him to go back to heaven because when the helper comes there'll be more opportunity for ministry.
[time=731] And so God has granted us this Holy Spirit inside of us and because of that he is accomplishing more than we could ever acknowledge and understand.
[time=743] What a priceless gift on the individual front to each of us individually he does things. He illuminates our minds to understand the truth of Scripture. He convicts of sin.
[time=755] He guides us into truth.
[time=759] Romans 8 tells us that he even takes our prayers and intercedes for us on our behalf so that the right words go up to God. So that when we don't even know what to pray for those prayers and intercedes for us on behalf of the Father. And so the Spirit is actively working in each of our lives individually but today I want to look at what Paul is talking about is this. An opportunity for all of us to grow in our understanding of the Holy Spirit and to grow in our faith in the Holy Spirit specifically in the context of the local Church.
[time=799] Specifically regarding when we gather together as the people of God. It could be in this context.
[time=807] It could be in an ABF setting. It could be in a small group setting.
[time=811] It could be in your home when the people of God gather together which is your family maybe. But when the people gather together and one of the major ways the Holy Spirit is active in the life of the Church is by distributing and empowering what the New Testament calls spiritual gifts.
[time=835] You know when you're especially I think sometimes in the summer especially after this harsh winter. You know when you're driving around Fort Wayne and all of a sudden you see some cones that cause two lanes to go down to one lane right and your first thought is oh great how long is this going to take.
[time=851] But secondly you come up to this you know orange sign and that orange sign says men at work right.
[time=859] I was communicated a message similar to that that I think would be helpful for our church and if there were able to be a big orange sign out in the hallway out there and maybe one at the back door and maybe one down by the door of the high school and maybe one by this side door but a big orange sign that simply stated Holy Spirit at work because that's the reality when we come together as the people of God in the Church of God the Holy Spirit is at work. He is actively engaged purposefully and strategically accomplishing what he wants by distributing and empowering the gifts of the Holy Spirit. So today as we explore this in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 my goal is to keep it very simple.
[time=911] Three foundational truths about the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the church and then we'll conclude with a few thoughts on how to respond.
[time=923] But let's look to the scriptures 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse 1 through 11 chapters 12, 13, and 14 are in many series on the spiritual gifts and these first 11 verses of that many series are really the foundational aspects to the topic of spiritual gifts as a whole but let's read what Paul has for us it says this. Now concerning spiritual gifts brothers and do not want you to be uninformed you know that when you are pagans you are led astray to mute idols however you were led therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says Jesus is a cursed and no one can say Jesus is Lord except in the Holy Spirit.
[time=971] Now there are varieties of gifts but the same spirit there are varieties of service but the same Lord there are varieties of activities but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good for to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit to another faith by the same Spirit to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another the ability to distinguish between spirits to another various kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues all these are empowered by one and the same Spirit who apportions to each one individually as he wills Father this morning we come again to you acknowledging just our desperate need to hear from you once again we live in this world that is blasting us with so many messages to satisfy ourselves to pursue our own desires self is the most important on and on and on and we desperately need to come back to hear truth from you to be reminded of the truth of your scriptures to be reminded again of the good that you have for us through your gospel and through your commands and we would recognize them as they truly are friendly signposts from a heavenly Father who has nothing but love for us so God this morning I ask that you would just allow your spirit to have his way oh God would you grant me this morning gifts gifts of clarity of thought and gifts of prophetic utterances from your word gifts of clarity God I pray that the people who are sitting here today who are listening online I pray that you would grant them the illumination of your spirit to understand what you want us to understand I pray that you grant gifts Lord to us today
[time=1117] that we could be built up as your body
[time=1123] oh Spirit I pray that you take these words that I prayed and on my behalf just take them to the Father we trust you excited to hear from you today Christ's name we pray these things amen well three foundational principles as we move forward trusting that the Holy Spirit will have his way in us today number one is this foundational principle number one the Holy Spirit reveals the person of Christ comes in verses two and three as you read it says this you know that when you were pagans you were led astrayed and mute idols however you were led therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the spirit of God ever says Jesus is a curse and no one can say Jesus is Lord except in the Holy Spirit now admittedly these verses on the first reading are somewhat confusing and so in order for us I think to gain some clarity around what Paul is saying here I want us to take a look at a couple of verses that I think will be helpful to form a backdrop for these verses verse two and three and first Corinthians 12 so you don't have to turn there but in Matthew 16 starting in verse 13 to 20 there's an interesting interaction that I think will be helpful for us to see between Jesus and his disciples specifically Jesus and Peter and so in verse 13 of Matthew 16 it says this now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples this question who do people say that the son of man is and they said some say John the Baptist other say Elijah and others Jeremiah are one of the prophets Jesus said to them but who do you say that I am?
[time=1235] Simon Peter replied you are the Christ the son of the living God Jesus answered him and said this blessed are you Simon bargeona for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven see what's going on there Jesus is just responding to allow Peter to know that there is no earthly way there is no human capability that he would have had in and of himself to understand the true reality of Jesus only God could reveal that to him in John chapter 15 26 it's the second backtrack that I think will be helpful it says this but when the helper comes talking about the spirit when the helper comes whom I will send to you from the father the spirit of truth who proceeds from the father he will bear witness about me you see the work or the the job of the Holy Spirit is to come and to actually shine a light on the person and work of Jesus that we would be able to see who he truly is that he would not be veiled that there would be no misunderstanding of who he is but that we would be able to see who he is clearly so Matthew 16 and John 15 come together and as we bring those verses in light of the truth that that we saw from those verses into what Paul is saying I think we can say this from verses two and three even though it may be a little bit confusing Paul is saying if you are a Christian the only reason that you are one is because the Holy Spirit revealed to you the true reality of Christ the spirit allows you to see Christ's true beauty the spirit opens your eyes and illumines your mind to see Christ's true glory his true deity his true authority the spirit opens your eyes and shines a light on the Christ and says listen look and see he is ultimately your loving Lord and when this revelation happens when this revelation of the spirit happens at the moment of your salvation you if you're a Christian were brought into a radically new and different reality wherein you now view Christ as he truly is the king of kings and the Lord of lords you see you once I once did not view him in this regard I once did not view him in this way the thought of him as Lord for some of us was at best foreign but for many of us it was repulsive for many of us the lordship of Christ over our lives was oppressive was something that we were not wanting that we were in fact running away from 1 Corinthians chapter 2 same book go back a few chapters in verse 6 it says this and this helps us to understand that there really is a contrast between verse 2 and 3 things are very different in verse 2 of 1 Corinthians 12 than they are a verse 3 right I mean at one point we were led away to idols and then we're led to understand Jesus's lordship but it says this yet among the mature we do impart wisdom though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age who are doomed to pass away but we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God which God decreed before the ages for our glory none of the rulers of this age understood this for if they had they would not have crucified the Lord of glory but as it is written what no eye has seen nor ear heard nor the heart of man imagined what God has prepared for those who love him these things God has revealed to us through the spirit for if the spirit searches everything even the depths of God for who knows a person's thought except the spirit of that person which is in him so also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit who is from God that we might understand the things freely given us by God in verse 13 and we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the spirit interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual now watch this in verse 14 the natural person that's simply referring to those who do not have the spirit of God in them the natural person is the person apart from Christ the natural person does not accept the things of the spirit of God for they are folly to him and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually appraised see how this same line of thought shows up in chapter 12 in verses 2 and 3 there's a very clear before and after prior to acknowledging the lordship of Christ by faith we were all led astray going our own way with ourselves as lead and we had no ability to see Christ rightly that being led astray may have looked different for each of us right?
[time=1595] depending upon the idols that we choose verse 2 says however you were being led away but now that we have placed or if you have placed your faith in Christ you have been brought into a radically new way of pursuing and living life under the leadership of Christ we now have a new leader now have a new head I am now a part of the body of Christ with the person of Christ as my head as my authority I now not only have a right understanding of the person of Christ but also I am now somehow mystically spiritually certified with him to such an extent that I'm a part of his body what it says in chapter 12 verse 13 for in one spirit we were all baptized into one body verse 27 now you are the body of Christ the spirit by revealing the true person of Christ has ushered us into a radical new life and understanding of Jesus as Lord so you just say Josh why is this such a big deal I mean it's pretty basic right I think it's a big deal because of this because a right understanding of Christ viewing him as he truly is a right understanding of Christ is the distinctive center of every Christian spiritual life and spiritual ministry you can't spiritually minister well unless Christ is at the center your life spiritually will not be going well unless Christ is at the center it is he is what makes us distinctively Christian he is what makes our spiritual gifts distinctively Christian as they're empowered in and through the Holy Spirit a right understanding of Christ is the distinctive center of every Christian spiritual life and spiritual ministry in other words one who does not have this understanding of Christ has no life and will have no ability or power to exercise any of the gifts empowered by the spirit foundational principle number one the Holy Spirit reveals the person of Christ today if you know Christ I want you to be encouraged because of the active work of the Holy Spirit in your life you are now viewing Christ very differently very clearly as Lord and Savior and it positions you to be used by the Spirit as he sees fit principle number two the Holy Spirit empowers the body of Christ in complete harmony with the Father and the Son then verses 4 through 11 he does this I believe by distributing gifts to each individual verse 7 says it this way to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good as you as we read through this earlier you can't help but notice the parallels can you can't help but notice the repetition of the Spirit I believe Paul is being very purposeful and trying to communicate a couple of things here a couple of truths one is I believe that he is communicating that the three persons of the Trinity are in concert together regarding the distribution and empowerment of these spiritual gifts this is not a solo act just by the Holy Spirit Paul is making sure that the Corinthians see the complete unity of the purpose in the Trinity Paul joins the Father and the Son and the Spirit in this empowering look at what it says in verses 4 through 6 he says there are varieties of gift but the same spirit there are varieties of service but the same Lord and there are varieties of activities but it is the same God notice how he's suggesting there how he's strategically showing the three persons of the Trinity all actively involved and engaged in this empowering of the body of Christ so whether God is mentioned in this section or the spirit or Jesus it is the same triune God that Paul is referring to each person in the Trinity is fully involved fully engaged working toward the health of the church the second truth and I think more the main point is that these gifts not only is he communicating the three persons of the Trinity there but he's also communicating that these gifts are from God empowered by God specifically the Spirit of God when we look at verses 8, 9 and 10 we can't help admittedly again we can't help but start to be drawn to this idea of these spiritual gifts right when we start to think about an utterance of wisdom or a knowledge or this idea of faith or working miracles or prophecy or speaking in tongues or interpreting tongues our first inclination is to go this this way that says gosh I wonder what my gift is gosh I wonder what this means I wonder what miracles means I wonder what tongues means I wonder if I have this gift or I could have this gift or I wonder if I could exchange gifts our first inclination when we think about this is to come back and think how this impacts me admittedly our attention is easily drawn to the gifts especially because we live in this me first mentality culture you know it reminds me Charlotte's Web one of my favorite children's book Charlotte's Web you've got this amazing group of animals right that are working together for this common cause to save Wilbur the pig right and so Charlotte is there and she's the spider and she spins the web and she these words in this web and all of them are trying to get new words so that they can save Wilbur if there's one in the farm that isn't necessarily going along with them right? Templeton the rat and so they're trying to think of some new word that they can put in the web so that somehow more people will come and see the amazing web and they're trying to get Templeton to go out and find some sort of scrap paper that would have some sort of name on it that would have an amazing superlative that they can put in the web and somehow save Wilbur and so they're trying to convince him and remember what Templeton said what's in it for me right? He was willing to go do it but he wanted to know what's he gonna get out of it right and as we look at this list of gifts that's where we're tempted to go what are we gonna get out of this how can we serve and yes some of that is very good and we want to be eager to serve but here the point that Paul is making isn't about us it's about the fact that we have a God who is willing and eager to support and build up the body by giving and distributing and empowering gifts for our good we want to naturally explore what these gifts are and how to use them but Paul simply just lists them there's no explanation of these gifts here there's no fanfare to these gifts in fact it's not even an exhaustive list of all the spiritual gifts that there are and so let's do this let's reread these verses and try to see what Paul is emphasizing is it mainly about the gifts and what they are and how they function or is it about the source of gifts verse 4 now there are a variety of gifts but the same spirit are varieties of service but the same Lord there are varieties of activities but the same God who empowers all to each is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good for one to one is given through the spirit the utterance of wisdom and to another utterance of knowledge according to the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by one spirit to another the working of miracles a prophecy to another the ability to distinguish between spirits to another various kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these all these gifts that I've just mentioned are empowered by one and the same spirit you tell me as you just listen what's what's the emphasis what's he trying to get across it's this one and same spirit the triune God who is actively engaged in empowering and distributing gifts to the body of Christ you see the repetition right and in case we missed the repetition look at the clarity of verse 11 all these are empowered by one and the same spirit and we in case we missed that clarity look at verse seven it says to each one is given the manifestation of the spirit you see the gifts are the manifestation of the spirit these gifts when exercised are simply the representation of the power of the spirit these gifts have nothing to do with our own worth or abilities or merit or mental aptitude and in case we still miss that Paul makes it very clear makes a very clear statement which can only be seen in the original language in verse 12 chapter 12 verse 1 he says now concerning spiritual gifts and he uses the word pneumaticon it means spiritual can you be used for the word spiritual gifts but in verses 4 and following he uses the Greek word Charismatica pneumaticon is about being spiritual Charismatica is a word that at its root means grace Charis is the Greek word for grace and so Paul is refocusing how the Corinthians viewed these that it's not about them being spiritual it's about the fact that God is willing to grace the body of Christ with these gifts and so the emphasis comes back upon the work of the Holy Spirit to distribute and empower gifts you see these gifts are all of God's grace we don't we don't deserve them we haven't some we don't have some sort of merit system that we can earn them they're all of God's grace and when this gets out of whack I know that I need to go back to principle number one at that point in order for the gifts to operate as Charismatica rather than Charismaticon so in order for the gifts to function in me in it to be not about me being spiritual but about me receiving the grace of God in and through me for the building up of the body in order for that to happen I have to be viewing Christ correctly I can't do the Charismatica if I'm not viewing Christ correctly there's no way to do it because I can easily slip back into following after the idols of my heart and exchanging Jesus's loving Lordship for my own selfish pursuits and my lustful desires foundational principle number two the Holy Spirit empowers the body of Christ by distributing gifts to each member as he chooses number one the Holy Spirit reveals the person of Christ ushering Christians into a new reality where Christ is the distinctive center of our lives in ministry and when you combine those two it leads to number three if it's the Lordship of Christ and it's the empowering of God's gift to us then we must understand that these gifts aren't used for us they're used for the body of Christ so number three the Holy Spirit does this for God's purposes look at verse seven to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good see these gifts aren't about me the gifts aren't about you but God in His grace has gifted us so that the body of Christ would be built up would grow to maturity in Christ as I said before 1 Corinthians 12, 13 and 14 are all about gifts and just to relay the point again about the common good in 1 Corinthians chapter 14 verse two it says this the one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God for no one understands him but he under mysteries in the Spirit but on the other hand the one who prophesies speak to people for their up building and encouragement and consolation the one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself but the one who prophesies builds up the church you see the emphasis in 14 look at verse 16 is this otherwise if you give thanks with your spirit how can anyone in a position of an outsider say amen to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying for you may be giving thanks well enough but the other person is not being built up verse 26 what then brothers when you come together each one has a hymn a lesson a revelation a tongue or an interpretation let all things be done for the building up see these gifts are for the building up of the body gifts are not to be used to call attention to us not to compare ourselves to one another or to boast about certain gifts I know that that's the way that I used to view it a lot of times I remember my senior year of high school 1991 I was a senior across the road at Blackhawk Christian High School they didn't have this building this sanctuary had been around for a few years but in 1991 Russell Moore came to be the pastor of Blackhawk Church and I remember as a young senior impressionable I just thought the world of him and as I listened to him preach and as I watched him interact with people and as I just saw him and how charismatic he was and and the way that he was able to explain God's word I wanted to be him I wanted to be up in front I wanted to be you know explaining the scriptures I wanted to be the lead I wanted to be the guy I remember that clearly back in high school in 1991 and now as I think of all the ways that God has grown me and is still grown but I look back at that and I think you know what my desires there certainly some of them were good and some of them were fine but most of it was just I wanted those gifts because I wanted to be up front and I wanted people to think highly of me that's not what it's about it's about the common good but secondly the Holy Spirit does this for God's purposes and he does it in very strategic ways look at verse 11 he says all these are empowered by one in the same spirit who apportions to each one individually and then just this little phrase as he wills do you understand that God is very intentional in his sovereignty he does nothing by mistake he is very purposeful and so the reality is that all of you in this room right now were designed and supposed to be here by God's sovereign plan and he gifted you if you're a part of the body of Christ and he so placed you in this context today so that you with your gifts through the power of the spirit would be used today in this context for the building up of the body of Christ maybe something as simple as going across the pew to shake a hand and say I'm praying for you brother it may be something as simple as you saying a prayer right now where you are for somebody in this room it may be you just singing with your whole heart out to the Lord and somebody watching you and being encouraged in the Lord because of your passion for the Lord in the way that you sing it could be lots of simple things but understand this you choose not to engage whether it's in this room or whether it's in a small group or whether it's in an A.B.F. Bible study or whether it's in your home as your home may be filled with believers when you choose not to engage to sit on the sidelines you're taking the sovereign plan of God and putting it on the sideline because when you don't engage the God isn't able to use the spirit in your life in the context that he has so designed for you to be in so fathers understand this God made no mistake in giving you the wife and the children that you have and he has so strategically placed you in that marriage and in that home he has gifted you very purposefully to be a minister of his to the building up of the body of Christ in your home you and small groups when you show up and it's been a hard week or a hard day when you come understand this that God has strategically placed you in that small group with the other people who are in that small group so that you would be able to fully engage and participate so that God through his Holy Spirit would use gifts to build up the body of Christ in that small group same thing for the Bible study same thing for whatever context the body of Christ is together God has strategically and purposefully put you in that context and gifted you in unique ways so that you could be used by him in those very strategic ways the Holy Spirit does this for God's purpose and he does it for the common good in very strategic ways well let's end where we started this morning verse 1, Paul says now concerning spiritual gifts brothers I do not want you to be uninformed this morning it's my desire that we would be informed this morning about spiritual gifts that the principles found here in the early verses of 1 Corinthians 12 that we would understand that they formed the foundation of all the spiritual gifts but more than just being informed I want us to see the heart of God that he is so willing to give gifts that he is as we sang earlier that he is for us and because he's for us he strongly supports us specifically in the way that he is building up the body of Christ through the work of the spirit in us and through us I want us to see the heart of God and I want us to live in the good of what he has accomplished and set in place for us could we be a people who eagerly anticipate the work of the spirit could we be a people who pray for the work of the spirit and understand as all this is happening that it's all just a part of God's grand design and beautiful vision for his church that I believe started before the world began you see God has a vision for his church this vision started before the world began and I believe that that vision continued to the pages of Genesis 1 and 2 as God's perfect world was spoken into existence and that vision took another step forward to the promise of a rescuer in God's perfect world as it was tarnished by the impact of a sinful choice which led to the impact of a sinful humanity and that vision for this beautiful church continued to move on to the ongoing promise of one who would be a blessing to the entire world and it moves on to the continued promise of a king who would come whose rule would never end and that vision continues on from the thoughts of God to 400 years of a silent God from Malachi to Matthew as the prophets anticipating and longing and crying for the coming one to enter human history and then that vision continued as there was the entrance of a baby into the world who was the fulfillment of all that had been spoken about in the Old Testament it's a vision of a life of unparalleled ministry and power and authority as he grew up and as he had his public ministry three years on the earth and then that vision continued to a shocking death with at that time what seemed to be an end to this vision when he was crucified and when he was put in a grave and the stone was rolled to cover it and yet that vision continued to a resurrected Savior and Lord who conquered death and came back to life and then this vision took steps forward as he then some departed and left this earth to go up to heaven and he promised a helper who would come and then that vision for this amazing church came as he left his throne and went to heaven and he left with these commanding words as he said in Matthew I will build my church and the gates of Hades will never overcome it and so in that grand design and that beautiful vision of the church of the Lord Jesus Christ we are here today as a part of that vision God in his grace allows us to participate in his purposes and his plans for the church to be a part of this glorious vision listen he certainly doesn't need me and I would guess that he certainly doesn't need you however he gives us the awesome opportunity to be a part of something bigger than ourselves to be a part of something bigger than any other endeavor in this world it's his church it's the proclamation of the beauty of Christ and what he accomplished at Calvary some 2000 years ago and he by the work of the spirit joins us together into his son as the body of Christ his church thank you for gifting us thank you for allowing us to join with you oh god how dare we suppose that you would need us you don't need anything and yet you would allow us the opportunity to be a part of what you're doing to be a part of your grand vision to be the body of your son Christ the church oh god I pray that we as a people would pray for and eagerly anticipate the work of your spirit and that we would fall in line under the loving lordship of your son and that we would give thanks for the way that you've gifted us and then that you would empower us to use those gifts in very simple ways some days to use those gifts for the common good ways that you have sovereignly ordained for us from the beginning of time oh god we love you we're so grateful that you have first loved us and now we sing to you as your people redeemed by the blood of the lamb in the power of your spirit amen and amen I stand amazed in the presence
[time=3257] of Jesus the Missouri
[time=3263] and wonder how he could love me I stand amazed in the presence
