[time=0] [MUSIC - 150 seconds]
[time=180] One more time, bud.
[time=183] [MUSIC - 149 seconds]
[time=342] >> Take me as you find me, all my fears and failures.
[time=350] I feel my life again.
[time=354] I give my life to follow everything I believe in.
[time=362] Now I surrender.
[time=367] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=437] >> This morning, for those of us who believe, we really believe that we have the good news right, that we have the greatest news, and it's not the kind of thing that we want to get for ourselves and keep it.
[time=444] I know we don't see it that way, but we do as the song is about to say, we want to shine our life.
[time=449] We want that to be evident to those around us.
[time=452] So this morning, we want to pray for boldness and we want to pray for the feeling of God's spirit and who would let us do that.
[time=458] So this morning, let's sing about shining our life.
[time=461] We're going.
[time=465] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=595] >> From the darkest night to the brightest day, constant you and me, every single breath to my dying day.
[time=608] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=738] >> You are God, God of all.
[time=746] We will sing forever.
[time=754] You are God, God of all.
[time=762] We will sing forever.
[time=770] You are God, God of all.
[time=778] We will sing forever.
[time=788] You are God, God of all.
[time=794] We will sing forever.
[time=804] I will give you praise.
[time=810] For all you are, I will give you praise.
[time=816] You are constant and faithful, you never change, you are constant and faithful, you never change.
[time=832] [MUSIC]
[time=842] >> Well, good morning.
[time=843] It's good to be with you.
[time=845] Hope everybody is doing well this morning.
[time=848] It's going to be a beautiful day.
[time=850] Looks like out there.
[time=851] If you have your Bibles turned to 2 Corinthians chapter 5, I'm sure most of you know who I am.
[time=860] For those of you who don't, my name is Josh Rang.
[time=863] I'm a member of the teaching team here at Blackhawk.
[time=866] I grew up here, went to the Christian school on the other side of the street back in those days.
[time=872] Kindergarten through 12th grade and have the privilege of serving on the teaching team
[time=879] here for the past few years, which is a great privilege.
[time=884] So we're in the midst of a series here at Blackhawk called Life Together.
[time=890] We've been moving through the book of 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians.
[time=894] As I said earlier, we are in the midst of 2 Corinthians chapter 5.
[time=899] God's provisions for our groanings, 2 Corinthians chapter 5.
[time=906] So I think I've been this way for a little while, but I'm slowly just converting my wife, Paula, over to this as well.
[time=915] But I can confidently say, as many of you might be able to relate, but when it comes down to it, I'm a trip guy.
[time=923] I love going on trips.
[time=925] I love what it does. I love looking forward to the trip.
[time=929] I love thinking about the trip.
[time=932] We don't go on a ton of trips, but when we do, it just does something for me that I just get excited about.
[time=938] I think about all the memories that we're going to have when we go to that place.
[time=944] I think of all the fun that we'll have, the different experiences that we'll have, and the things that we'll get to see.
[time=950] We just recently had the privilege of meeting some friends from California when I attended seminary out there,
[time=956] but we met them in Phoenix.
[time=958] Actually, Northern Arizona, we went to the Grand Canyon, which is the first time I've ever been to the Grand Canyon, to see Hollis and Jillian just stand at the edge and just be an awe of all that.
[time=969] It was awesome.
[time=970] It was awesome to see the Grand Canyon, but awesome to see them see the Grand Canyon for the first time.
[time=976] As I think about that, I just was looking forward to that trip for a long time.
[time=982] A knowable future can greatly impact the present.
[time=987] That enjoyment of looking forward to that trip helped me in the present, helped me get through days at work that I wasn't so excited about.
[time=999] Gave me an anticipation of what was come, sometimes even made me be a little bit more efficient and a little bit more focused
[time=1007] while I was at work, especially as the trip started to get a little bit closer, because I knew that I didn't want to have a bunch on my plate when I came back.
[time=1016] All of these positive things about the present impacting me, because I knew the future, I knew what was coming shortly in the future.
[time=1026] I would say that's kind of like a functional vacationology.
[time=1031] So in other words, that vacation was having a function in my life that I think produced some really good things,
[time=1037] and so I always look forward to saying, "What's next?" The reality is, with our spiritual walk, there needs to be a functional theology.
[time=1050] So what we know is true about God and what he has done needs to function in our lives on a daily basis.
[time=1058] I'm really good at theory.
[time=1061] I love thinking about theory.
[time=1063] I love thinking about those things that are true, but it's really challenging for me.
[time=1067] Maybe you can relate to get that theory down into practice, right?
[time=1071] I can know the right thing to do, and I can know that when I do that right thing, it will produce good things from it,
[time=1079] and yet to actually relay that into the practice of my daily life can sometimes be very difficult.
[time=1087] What we need is a functional theology, not just a functional vacationology, right?
[time=1094] Today, as we look at 2 Corinthians chapter 5, Paul is helping us with this idea of a functional theology,
[time=1101] and that in verses 1 through 5, he's going to give us two truths to think about this morning.
[time=1107] And then in verses 6 through 10, he's going to take us and follow his line of thought to say that
[time=1113] these two truths should have an impact in the present, in the way that we live our lives on a daily basis.
[time=1122] So as we look at verses 1 through 10, verse 1 is really just kind of a summary statement, and then verses 2, 3, 4, and 5 give us these two truths that he tells us,
[time=1133] and then verses 6 through 10 are going to give us three responses from that truth.
[time=1139] So let's take a look at it this morning, 2 Corinthians chapter 5, and let's read it together.
[time=1147] For we know that if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God,
[time=1154] a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
[time=1158] For in this tent, we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling, if indeed by putting it on,
[time=1167] we may not be found naked. For while we are still in this tent, we groan, being burdened.
[time=1173] Not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
[time=1181] He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.
[time=1190] Verse 6, so we are always of good courage.
[time=1194] We know that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord, for we walk by faith and not by sight.
[time=1200] Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
[time=1205] So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him.
[time=1210] For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ so that each one may receive what is due
[time=1216] for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.
[time=1221] Let's pray this morning.
[time=1223] Father, we once again come.
[time=1226] God, week after week after week after week, we need to hear from you.
[time=1236] God, I am so grateful that your Son, Jesus, is our great shepherd.
[time=1241] And he shepherds his sheep perfectly.
[time=1249] So, God, we come this morning, and we need your shepherding.
[time=1255] And God, even as we learn from 1 Corinthians chapter 12, we can confidently know that your Spirit is at work in our midst in the church,
[time=1264] building us up and doing his work in the way that he sees fit.
[time=1269] And so I pray for each and every one of us this morning that you would do what you want to accomplish in our lives, each and every one of us.
[time=1278] I pray that our eyes would be opened.
[time=1280] I pray that our ears would be quick to listen and slow to speak.
[time=1286] And God, for me this morning, I pray that what has been prepared, that your Spirit would empower.
[time=1297] And God, that your Spirit would have his way in this congregation and in this time this morning.
[time=1304] Ultimately, God, for your glory and for your honor.
[time=1308] In Christ's name, we pray. Amen.
[time=1313] So two truths that we are told, and three responses from those truths.
[time=1319] Let's look at the two truths we are told in verses 2 through 5.
[time=1323] The first truth is this.
[time=1325] In this tent, we groan.
[time=1330] This phrase is used two times in three verses.
[time=1333] It's used the first time in verse 2 when it says, "For in this tent we groan." And then again, almost the exact same phrase is repeated in verse 4.
[time=1342] "For while we are still in this tent, we groan." This groaning is a reality that we face every day from our mortality and from the world that we live in.
[time=1355] This groaning stems from a present reality that we all experience in different ways depending on your different experiences.
[time=1363] But it's a groaning from a reality from the impact of sin in this world.
[time=1370] The lies and the disease and the death and the destruction, the dysfunction that we all have to face in our daily lives.
[time=1379] Paul described it this way in Romans 8 starting in verse 20.
[time=1384] He said this, "For the creation was subjected to futility."
[time=1390] Not willingly, but because of him who subjected it.
[time=1393] In hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption
[time=1400] and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
[time=1404] For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.
[time=1412] But not only creation, but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the Spirit,
[time=1420] we groan inwardly as we await eagerly for the adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.
[time=1431] You see, the world we live in and these bodies we function in give each and every one of us
[time=1441] a proper and real understanding that we are indeed broken and that our world is indeed broken.
[time=1450] You don't have to look far.
[time=1452] You can pick up a local newspaper, you can watch the national news, you can look internationally,
[time=1458] you can even probably look in your own family and see the brokenness of this world.
[time=1466] And that's where this groaning comes from.
[time=1469] And this groaning, I believe what Paul is communicating to us this morning is this groaning leads to two contingent thoughts.
[time=1476] The first thought that we'll look at actually forces the second thought.
[time=1480] But the first thought is this.
[time=1482] You can see it in verse two.
[time=1484] We groan and then it says this.
[time=1486] Longing to put on our heavenly dwelling.
[time=1491] That word longing is the same word for lust.
[time=1494] It's a strong desire.
[time=1496] So in the midst of the confusion and chaos of this world, there is in each and every one of us a strong desire for something more.
[time=1506] For something better, for what is to come.
[time=1509] Ecclesiastes 3 tells us that God has put eternity in our hearts.
[time=1514] There is not one of us who doesn't have a longing for something better and what is next.
[time=1520] You see, we all have a desire to not be as frail as we are.
[time=1526] To not be limited by our own mortality.
[time=1530] To have an eager expectation for what God has in store.
[time=1535] We can think of it in simple terms.
[time=1537] My daughter Gillian on a regular occasion would love to fly.
[time=1543] Not in a plane, you know.
[time=1546] Not in a helicopter, but just her.
[time=1549] She would love to be able to fly.
[time=1552] I think that would be really cool.
[time=1554] But that's not going to happen here, right?
[time=1556] Maybe one day.
[time=1558] It can be as simple as just sickness that we face.
[time=1561] I will tell you, I love to have fun, but there are times when I'm at an amusement park, especially with my kids, and there are those rides that go round and round and round, and it just does not go well with me.
[time=1573] I'm sure it's at every place but Cedar Point.
[time=1576] There's that ride where the cords hang down and there's seed at the end of the cord and you just hang there and you swing around and around.
[time=1584] And it has some kind of music that they play with it.
[time=1587] If I get within even earshot of that thing, it's all over.
[time=1593] And how nice would it be to not have to deal with that, right?
[time=1598] From simple things to the idea of this, some of you are ready for your new body
[time=1604] because the emotional strain that it's under day after day has just become too heavy to carry.
[time=1614] Others are ready for that new body because the cancer that has come back for the third time
[time=1621] is present again.
[time=1623] Or the reality of living without a limb, or the reality of living with MS, or some other kind of debilitating disease that you have to live with.
[time=1631] It's tiring living life as mortals.
[time=1636] Dealing with sickness and memory loss and decreasing capacities of functionality, right?
[time=1642] I am not enjoying getting old.
[time=1648] It just isn't going so well, right?
[time=1651] I used to be really good at basketball, but not anymore.
[time=1656] There is just this decreasing capacity of functionality.
[time=1660] I used to be able to memorize verses really well, not anymore.
[time=1665] There's just too much junk up here, and I can't get rid of it.
[time=1671] Decreasing capacities of an ability to function in this world is getting less and less.
[time=1679] It's just oozing out of us, right?
[time=1686] This is why our culture, I think, is so preoccupied with superheroes.
[time=1691] I mean, how many of us want to be a superhero, right?
[time=1695] Is that Flash Gordon right there?
[time=1697] Yeah.
[time=1698] He's got a T-shirt, a Flash Gordon.
[time=1699] I mean, I would love to be wearing that T-shirt right now.
[time=1701] It looks good on you.
[time=1703] Yeah.
[time=1704] I mean, we're enthralled with those who are not limited by our mortality,
[time=1711] this mortal body, they fly, they run faster, they're stronger than 30 men combined.
[time=1720] And from an early age, we want to be like them until age and reality and reason
[time=1729] eventually catch up with us, right?
[time=1732] Although for some, it might be a little later than others.
[time=1737] But we all experience that.
[time=1741] So the thrust of Paul's argument here isn't necessarily that we all want to be superhuman,
[time=1747] but that we all realize and know the frailty and mortality of our human bodies
[time=1753] and that we all are longing for something better, for what's next, for what God might have in store for us.
[time=1763] You see, the groaning leads to the desire for our spiritual body.
[time=1769] That was Paul's first thought.
[time=1771] And as we stated earlier, this first thought forces a second thought.
[time=1776] This groaning also leads to a burden for more covering.
[time=1781] Look at what it says in verses three and four.
[time=1784] He says in verse two, "This tent we groan longing to put on our heavenly dwelling, if indeed by putting it on, we may not be found naked.
[time=1792] For while we are still in this tent we groan, being burdened.
[time=1797] Not that we would be unclothed, but the burden is that we would be further clothed
[time=1803] so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life." Now let's dive into this because it seems a little confusing as to what Paul is actually saying.
[time=1813] Watch how Paul's argument flows here.
[time=1816] We long to have our spiritual bodies, a strong desire for that.
[time=1822] But as we think about that reality, we begin to understand the implications of one day being before God.
[time=1830] And as it says in verse three, "I'm good with my spiritual body as long as I am not found naked."
[time=1838] And what he's saying there is this, that word for naked can certainly mean without clothing,
[time=1844] but it also can mean open and laid bare.
[time=1848] And so the fact that yes, I'm going to have a spiritual body, but also that that spiritual body is going to have to give an account to the Lord one day.
[time=1856] Now I've got some further concern.
[time=1859] I need some further covering.
[time=1864] Remember Adam and Eve back in the garden?
[time=1867] This terminology that Paul uses really reminds me of what's going on there.
[time=1872] On the side note, Genesis chapters one, two, and three, many people will call that poetic language.
[time=1879] I don't think that's true.
[time=1880] I think that's historical language.
[time=1884] And I think that most if not all of our theology in the rest of the Bible finds its origin in Genesis one, two, and three.
[time=1894] But remember what it said there in Genesis chapter two, verse twenty-five?
[time=1899] It says, "And the man and his wife were both naked and they were not ashamed.
[time=1904] They were open. They were laid bare.
[time=1907] They were not hiding anything. They didn't have to hide anything.
[time=1911] They were completely open to each other.
[time=1916] Physically, emotionally, spiritually, and they were not ashamed.
[time=1923] There was no reason to hide, and yet Genesis three-seven, a few short verses says this, after they had taken of the fruit and ate of it, it says this, then the eyes of both of them were opened.
[time=1938] And they knew that they were naked.
[time=1942] That realization flooded right in.
[time=1945] That, "Oh, wait a second. I don't want you to see me. I don't want you to have any kind of introspection into who I really am."
[time=1957] They ended up sowed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths, it says in Genesis three.
[time=1965] You see, ever since then humanity has been trying to cover ourselves, haven't we?
[time=1973] Trying to hide the reality of our sinful human hearts.
[time=1978] And I would think each and every one of us has something that we would never want anyone to know.
[time=1986] And yet with our spiritual body, we will stand before God.
[time=1992] And we need further clothing.
[time=1996] So Paul states this beautifully in verse four. He says this, that while we are still in this tent,
[time=2003] this tent means this earthly body, we groan and we're burdened, not that we would be unclothed.
[time=2010] Not that we would not have a spiritual body, but the burden is that we would be further clothed.
[time=2017] In other words, in this tent, in this mortal body, we are completely aware, intimately aware of our sinfulness.
[time=2025] And the burden comes that when we stand before God, that we would somehow be clothed.
[time=2032] That we would not be open and laid bare before him to whom we must give an account of our lives.
[time=2040] Hebrews four says it this way.
[time=2044] And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him
[time=2053] to whom we must give an account.
[time=2056] You see what's going on in these verses is this, the prevailing thought of the day in Corinth was that there was no spiritual body. There was no afterlife.
[time=2065] The physical was it and then nothing.
[time=2068] And this is why Paul makes it a point to say that his burden isn't that we would be unclothed.
[time=2075] Which that word unclothed mean that we would not have a spiritual body.
[time=2079] Paul is combating the prevailing thought of the day by communicating that the Corinthians need not worry about not having a body,
[time=2087] but they should be concerned with the notion that their spiritual body would be further clothed.
[time=2094] I think it's clear even from the concept of the word burden.
[time=2098] That word burden means to be weighed down.
[time=2103] There's a reality that in this life we feel the weight of the law and the power of sin, right?
[time=2110] I mean that is a heavy burden to carry.
[time=2114] Even Jesus said himself in Matthew 11.
[time=2117] He said come to me all you who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest.
[time=2124] That's everybody.
[time=2126] Apart from him it is a burden. It is weary for us to carry the weight of the law.
[time=2136] And yet look at the end of verse 4, the goal of all that is so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
[time=2147] You see everyone gets a spiritual eternal body, but some will be swallowed up by death and others will be swallowed up by life.
[time=2161] So the first truth we're told is that our mortal bodies are groaning and that groaning leads to a longing for a spiritual body.
[time=2169] And secondly this groaning leads to a burden for this spiritual body to be further covered.
[time=2174] The second truth is great news.
[time=2177] The second truth comes in verse 5 as we understand these concerns that we have about that first truth.
[time=2184] A concern that we would have a spiritual body and a concern that that spiritual body would be further clothed.
[time=2189] He says this in verse 5, "He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee."
[time=2200] The second truth told is this, God has prepared his children.
[time=2206] We are longing God has already covered it.
[time=2210] God has prepared his children.
[time=2212] What is yet future for every Christian has already been prepared by God in the past and is unfolding according to his plan and his will.
[time=2222] We have a concern for a spiritual body.
[time=2225] Verse 1 tells us we have a building from God. We long for a spiritual body and indeed we will have one.
[time=2232] Look what it says in verse 1.
[time=2234] We know that if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed, that's our physical body, that we have a building from God.
[time=2242] A house not made with hands eternal in the heaven.
[time=2246] Paul was a tent maker and he uses that analogy of a tent and understanding the temporary nature of a tent.
[time=2253] Contrasting that with a building that will have permanence to it, our earthly body will be permanent.
[time=2263] It's a building that comes from God.
[time=2267] In 1 Corinthians 15 he says it this way, "So it will be with the resurrection of the dead.
[time=2272] What is sown perishable will be raised imperishable.
[time=2276] What is sown in dishonor is raised in glory.
[time=2279] What is sown in weakness will be raised in power.
[time=2282] It is sown in natural body. It's raised a spiritual body." And Philippians 3 says this, "Our citizenship is in heaven and from it we await our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=2295] and He will transform our lowly bodies to be like His glorious body."
[time=2305] God has prepared us for this already.
[time=2310] He has prepared us for a spiritual body and it's a body that's not made with hands.
[time=2316] It's not earthly. It's eternal in the heavens.
[time=2319] This spiritual house will not be subject to the impact of sin.
[time=2323] There will be no diminishing capacities of functionality.
[time=2328] There will be no living with disease or any such other thing.
[time=2332] He has prepared us for a perfect body and as it said in Philippians, that body will be like His glorious body.
[time=2343] The spiritual body we are groaning for has already been prepared for us by God.
[time=2349] But what about the covering that we need, that burden to be further covered?
[time=2357] Let's go back to Genesis as God clothed Adam and Eve in the garden by killing an animal and using its skin for their covering.
[time=2367] So He has clothed us by slaying His Son and clothing us in the very robe of Christ's righteousness.
[time=2380] That's the further covering that we need and that's the covering that has been prepared for us already.
[time=2389] You see, the one who would crush the head of Satan in Genesis 3 would do so by allowing His heel to be bruised.
[time=2399] So He has clothed us and as His heel is bruised, He suffered and bled on the cross for my sin and yours.
[time=2410] And through this work His people can be further clothed.
[time=2417] Listen to what the prophet Isaiah said in Isaiah chapter 61.
[time=2422] He says, "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall exalt in my God, for He has clothed me with the garments of salvation.
[time=2431] He has covered me with the robe of righteousness." At the very end of our passage in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21 it says this, "And one of my favorite parables in the gospel, Luke 15, the prodigal son, and you understand the story of the son leaving and pursuing his own future,
[time=2461] but that he comes back and as he's coming back the father sees him, runs to him and embraces him and says this in Luke 15, 22,
[time=2470] the father said to his servants, "Bring quickly the best robe and put it on him."
[time=2478] I think that's just an analogy.
[time=2481] When we come back to the father, he says, "Oh, bring the robe, the robe of Christ, righteousness."
[time=2492] Philippians 3 again, Paul says, "I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord, for His sake,
[time=2502] I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as but rubbish in order that I may gain Christ and be found in Him,
[time=2509] not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ."
[time=2518] And not only all of this, not only has he prepared those things for us, but he also has given us a down payment.
[time=2528] What it says at the end of verse 5, "He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee."
[time=2539] That word guarantee is a down payment. I'm giving you some now.
[time=2546] What I'm giving you isn't everything because there's much more to come.
[time=2551] The Holy Spirit is the guarantee that all of this will come to pass.
[time=2556] We have him now and one day we will have even more.
[time=2562] You see, Paul communicates two truths in these verses.
[time=2565] The first brings up some big concerns.
[time=2568] We need something better than these mortal bodies. We need a spiritual body.
[time=2573] And we need those spiritual bodies to be further closed so that we're not naked and laid bare.
[time=2578] The second truth brings great hope as it answers the concerns brought up by the first truth.
[time=2583] God has prepared us for these things.
[time=2586] We will have a spiritual body and we will be further clothed through the work of Christ.
[time=2593] And all of those truths leads to these three responses.
[time=2600] You see, truth impacts living, right?
[time=2606] Say it a different way.
[time=2608] The declaratives, okay, think back to English class for a second.
[time=2613] Declarative sentences are statements of fact.
[time=2616] So declaratives, things that are true about God and what he has done, declaratives fuel our obedience to the imperatives.
[time=2627] Imperatives are commands.
[time=2630] And so Paul is showing us in the way that he's laid this out that the truths that he's just expressed
[time=2637] are going to be the fuel for us that allow us to be obedient in these three ways.
[time=2647] Each of these responses are best embodied and carried out when our minds are saturated
[time=2654] with the truth of God's goodness to us as expressed in verses 1 through 5.
[time=2661] And those responses are one that we would be of good courage, two that we would walk by faith,
[time=2669] and three that we would be pleasing to the Lord.
[time=2673] So here is where our theology needs to function, right?
[time=2677] A functional theology.
[time=2680] The truths that we've just been told that God has prepared us for the future through the work of Christ
[time=2689] on our behalf in the past should lead us to a different mindset, a different belief,
[time=2697] and a different practice in the present.
[time=2701] First, be of good courage.
[time=2703] It's a different mindset.
[time=2705] It comes in verse 6 and verse 8.
[time=2708] So we are always of good courage.
[time=2712] Verse 8, yes, we are of good courage. There's this emphasis upon knowing what is true.
[time=2721] We have confidence in the reality of our eternal good through the kindness and benevolence of God.
[time=2729] The fact that God has prepared us for the future through the work of Christ on our behalf in the past
[time=2737] should lead us to have a different mindset in the present.
[time=2741] A different way of looking at life, a different way of approaching life.
[time=2746] I think that this word "courage" is talking about an overall disposition of your life,
[time=2752] which is characterized by joy in any and every circumstance.
[time=2757] It's characterized by a quiet confidence, no matter what's happening around you.
[time=2763] It's characterized by a disposition of a rest in the sovereignty of God.
[time=2770] You see, in the midst of this world, in the midst of our groaning for something better,
[time=2776] in the midst of all that's going on, where groaning is a reality, where the sting of divorce is real,
[time=2782] where the pain of memory loss impacts everyone involved, where the reminders of our mortality
[time=2788] and the impact of sin are all around us.
[time=2792] We, knowing what we know, can have a cheerful, even joyful, and confident disposition about us
[time=2803] because we know, we know that we will be with our Father one day,
[time=2809] and He has prepared us to be with Him through the work of His Son at Calvary.
[time=2815] And we currently experience, even in the midst of those trials, in the midst of that longing, in the midst of our mortality, we have the comfort of the down payment, the Holy Spirit, to care for us and to comfort us.
[time=2833] You see, what we know doesn't necessarily take away the hurt.
[time=2839] It doesn't take away the circumstance, or it doesn't take away the realities that we all have to face.
[time=2847] It doesn't take away the realities of our mortality, but it does give us hope.
[time=2854] And this hope makes a difference when we face the onslaught of challenges coming at us each and every day.
[time=2868] Allowing our theology to function as we rest in the knowledge of who He is and what He's done.
[time=2875] You see, the first response to the truth in one through five is that we are a people of good courage.
[time=2883] The second is this, that we are a people who walk by faith, verse seven.
[time=2892] For we walk by faith, not by sight. There's a reality actually in verse six.
[time=2898] We know that while we're at home in the body, we are away from the Lord.
[time=2902] There's this idea that while we're in our bodies, we aren't seeing what's to come.
[time=2909] We don't have a glimpse of that yet.
[time=2912] You see, while no one has seen or can even completely comprehend a spiritual body,
[time=2919] and while no one has seen the actual robe of Christ's righteousness,
[time=2925] there is ample reason to walk by faith and not by sight.
[time=2932] The fact that God has prepared us for the future through the work of Christ on our behalf in the past
[time=2938] should lead us to a different belief in the present.
[time=2942] You see, we should be a people of great faith. However, our temptation is to do the opposite.
[time=2949] Our temptation is not to walk by faith, but to walk by sight, right?
[time=2954] Sometimes it seems so much easier. Our focus can be easily short-sighted.
[time=2960] In 2 Peter 1, we don't have the time to go there, but it says this.
[time=2963] It says if there are qualities of righteousness that come from you, if you have those qualities, then you will not be blind or short-sighted.
[time=2971] The idea is this, that you will not be so fixed on what's right in front of you that you lose sight of what God has done outside of what's in front of you.
[time=2985] When we're in this mortal body, we can easily begin to doubt because of that short focus.
[time=2992] Because of that short-sightedness, it reminds me of a phrase that Jesus used in the Gospels
[time=2998] to describe his disciples at times. There were times when he did amazing miracles and there were times when he asked his disciples to do things, and it just didn't work out for them.
[time=3007] And he called them this, "Oi El Capostoy." Little faith ones is what that means.
[time=3016] Look at them and just say, "You've seen all that I've done.
[time=3020] You've lived with me. You've experienced me, and yet you're still Oi El Capostoy."
[time=3027] Little faith ones.
[time=3031] I know there's many days where I'm that same way.
[time=3038] And yet when it comes back to it, we have much, much to believe in.
[time=3044] You see, faith is simply believing God. It's taking him at his word.
[time=3049] And one of the best ways to believe what he says is to look back and see what he's done.
[time=3056] The work of Christ at Calvary is one of the best proof of God's trustworthiness.
[time=3062] Romans 832, it says this, "The first service, I forgot it. It's my favorite verse, but I just drew a blank."
[time=3070] And it was just an example of my diminishing capacity of functionality.
[time=3075] It was an amazing reminder, and then God was gracious to bring it right back to me.
[time=3079] Romans 8, it says this, "See, now I'm just going to blank on it again."
[time=3087] It came to me a lot faster than this one. Romans 832, "He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all."
[time=3094] It's talking about the work of Christ at Calvary and how God gave his son up.
[time=3100] It says this, "If he did that, how will he not also freely give us all things in him?"
[time=3108] If God went to such an extent to secure our salvation through the death of his son,
[time=3114] what would ever make us think that he's not trustworthy?
[time=3118] That he's not going to do what he said he will do in the future.
[time=3123] So when this world is hitting you time and time again, don't be fooled by what you see and give up hope.
[time=3131] Walk by faith and believe the promise of God.
[time=3135] The first response to the truth in verses 1 through 5 is that we would be a people of good courage.
[time=3141] The second is that we are people who walk by faith.
[time=3143] And the third is that we are people whose aim is to please the Lord.
[time=3147] Verse 9 says it this way, "So whether we're at home or away, whether we're with him or here still on the earth,
[time=3153] we make it our aim to please him." You see, the fact that God has prepared us for the future through the work of Christ on our behalf in the past
[time=3164] should lead us to a different practice in the present.
[time=3169] Whether we're at home or away, this just made me think of all the ways that my wife Paula has just been faithful and committed to me.
[time=3181] On this earth, there's not very many people who have loved me consistently like she has.
[time=3186] Not perfectly, but time and time and time again, she's just shown her love to me in so many different ways.
[time=3193] And that makes me want to please her.
[time=3197] Out of the gratitude of all that she's done to me, I just, I want my aim in my marriage is to please her.
[time=3205] Now I don't do that perfectly and that's not my aim every day, but that's what flows from my thoughts about her faithfulness to me.
[time=3214] The same thing is true with Christ.
[time=3219] His ongoing commitment and faithfulness to us allows us to rejoice in that and then to make it our aim to please him with our lives.
[time=3229] Not because we have to, but because of all that he's done for us.
[time=3233] Romans 12 says it this way, "Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice.
[time=3241] Get up on the altar and offer your whole life to him, but do it not because you have to, but because of the mercies of God that have been shown on your behalf."
[time=3253] Who else has done for you what God has done?
[time=3257] No one.
[time=3259] Our aim is to please him.
[time=3263] So, I'm a trip guy.
[time=3268] I've got a functional vacationology, right?
[time=3273] When I look forward to that trip, it impacts my present in many different ways.
[time=3278] I'm praying this morning that we would all have a functional theology that our foreseeable future of that spiritual body being clothed in the righteousness of Christ
[time=3292] would allow us to have a functioning practice here in this life in the present.
[time=3298] It won't happen perfectly.
[time=3300] But listen to this, the first component of a functional theology is your salvation.
[time=3307] And if you're here this morning and if you've never come to understand who Jesus Christ is and what he's done, we'd love this morning to talk to you about that.
[time=3319] We'd love for you to come forward to one of our elders and have a conversation about the truth about him and how that can actually play a huge role, the biggest role in your life in the present.
[time=3331] The second component of a functionality is your sanctification.
[time=3334] Those who have already chosen to believe, who have accepted the grace of God, the best way for your sanctification to happen.
[time=3342] The best way for those responses to be a reality in your life is that you would consistently first know what is true about God.
[time=3352] Know what is true about you and what he's done and what he will do.
[time=3356] And as these truths begin to fill and flood your heart, your pores will start seeping and oozing the evidences of the fruit of a functional theology.
[time=3369] Out of the heart, the mouth speaks, right?
[time=3373] And so we need to be a people who not just try to live better lives, but that we would understand the truth of theology about who God is and what he's done.
[time=3384] And then as a result, it must lead.
[time=3388] It will lead to those responses that we've talked about this morning.
[time=3395] As you leave today, know that God has made provision for the groanings of your mortal body.
[time=3403] He will provide you with a perfect spiritual body fit for the heavens, and he has prepared a covering for your spiritual body, the very robe of Christ's righteousness, which was secured for you through the death of his son.
[time=3417] And so this morning, with those truths being a reality and letting them saturate your heart and your mind, go this morning with great courage.
[time=3428] Go this morning with great faith and go this morning with great gratitude, having your aim be to please the Lord, not because you have to,
[time=3443] but because of the wonderful truth that God has communicated to us this morning and the wonderful truth of theology about who he is and how he loves us.
[time=3453] Let's pray.
[time=3454] Father, thank you so much for your truth this morning.
[time=3459] Thank you for the opportunity to hear from you.
[time=3464] Lord, I pray that you would just flood and fill our hearts and our minds with what is true about you, and as that gets flooded into our hearts, Lord, I long to see just the fruit of your righteousness.
[time=3480] A functioning disposition of good cheer and good courage, a functioning reality of faithful people who go out into this world that walk by faith and not by sight, and a functioning reality of a practice that is pleasing to you, a life that is making its aim to please you.
[time=3505] And so God, open our eyes to these truths and allow them to seep in so that those responses could ooze out and that ultimately you'd be glorified and honored.
[time=3518] Oh God, thank you for your provision in the midst of our groaning. We desperately need you.
[time=3527] We praise you.
[time=3529] We thank you for first loving us.
[time=3532] It's in Christ's name that we pray these things. Amen.
