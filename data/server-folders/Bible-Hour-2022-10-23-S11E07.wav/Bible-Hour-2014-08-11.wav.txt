[time=31] Well, good morning, everybody.
[time=34] Welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=36] What a great privilege it is for us as part of the Bible Hour and Black Hawk team to bring you this broadcast week after week.
[time=44] And what a privilege it's been for me.
[time=46] Over the last 15 years to be with you here each and every week for the most part.
[time=52] And now is a time of transition.
[time=55] Now is a time where me and my family will be moving on from Black Hawk.
[time=61] Some of you may know that others of you may not.
[time=63] What a tremendous, tremendous opportunity this has been for me and for my family.
[time=69] What a joy it's been to serve here at Black Hawk.
[time=73] And what a great couple of months we've had as I've been in some honest and healthy discussions with our elders.
[time=81] And as I'm ready to go on to some new opportunities they continue to be ready to serve and do great ministry here at Black Hawk.
[time=90] I'm so thankful that as I go forward things that we've done, things that we've experienced, things that we've put in place will continue to go forward.
[time=100] I hope week after week after week you will continue to tune into the Bible Hour.
[time=105] I hope that this ministry will continue to make a difference in your life.
[time=109] You know, I've told you for years and I've meant it.
[time=112] I've always been truthful with you that the Word of God will change your life.
[time=116] The Scriptures have power within them to alter everything about you.
[time=122] And the message of the Word of God is able to not only redeem and restore and reconcile you, it's able to encourage you for the everyday of life.
[time=134] And no matter who's teaching it, no matter who's communicating it, as long as it's the Word of God, and that is exactly what you'll get here on this broadcast. You know that and I know that.
[time=144] As long as it's the Scripture, it will change you and it will transform you.
[time=148] I want to say thank you to many of you, hundreds of you who have over the years, given me a great sense of encouragement and the confidence that you've allowed me into your life.
[time=160] You've allowed us into your life and you've allowed us to play a part in your growth.
[time=165] And whether you're young or old or somewhere in between, please know what an encouragement it's been to me.
[time=172] This has been an honor.
[time=174] And as we go forward to what God has for us next, we're excited about that and looking forward to the days ahead, but as we look back, we will look back with great joy and with great gratitude.
[time=185] Thank you for all that you've meant to us and thank you for your support of this great ministry.
[time=190] Continue to support it and continue to invest in it and know how very much we love you and how thankful we are for you.
[time=198] Hey, as we've said for years and years, God bless you.
[time=201] And as always, we hope to see you soon.
