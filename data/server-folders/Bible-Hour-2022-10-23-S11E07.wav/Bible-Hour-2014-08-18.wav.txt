[time=43] It's not enough to do nothing.
[time=50] It's time for us to do something.
[time=52] [MUSIC]
[time=56] So tired of talking about who we are guys, hands and feet.
[time=60] It's easier to say than me if I came to us with empathy.
[time=64] Tell us it's all right, somebody else is gonna do something.
[time=70] [MUSIC]
[time=74] I don't know about you, but I'm sick and tired.
[time=78] But I'm both tired, I don't want to blame, I want to fire.
[time=83] I want to be the one, she stands up and says, I'm gonna do something.
[time=88] [MUSIC]
[time=92] If not us, then who?
[time=96] If not me and you right now?
[time=101] [MUSIC]
[time=104] It's time for us to do something.

[time=126] It's time for us to do something.
[time=129] [MUSIC]
[time=132] We are the sound of the air, we are sitting on a hill.
[time=137] Shine, shine, shine, shine, shine.
[time=141] We're never gonna change the world, I stand in the still.
[time=148] We're not gonna change the world, but we won't stand, sing, go.
[time=154] If not us, then who?
[time=159] If not me and you right now?
[time=164] [MUSIC]
[time=166] It's time for us to do something.
[time=170] [MUSIC]

[time=202] [APPLAUSE]
[time=206] >> But welcome to Blackhawk, good morning, it's good to see you.
[time=210] Thanks for being in God's house today.
[time=212] [MUSIC]
[time=218] >> In my wrestling and in my dance, in my failures, you won't walk out.
[time=226] Your great love will lead me through.
[time=231] You are the peace in my trouble, see whoa.
[time=242] In the silence, you won't let go.
[time=247] In the questions, your truth will hold.
[time=251] Your great love will lead me through.
[time=256] You are the peace in my trouble, see whoa.
[time=268] My lighthouse, my lighthouse, shining in the darkness.
[time=274] I will follow you, oh, my lighthouse, my lighthouse.
[time=281] I will trust the promise.
[time=283] You will carry me safe to show up, safe to show up, safe to show up, safe to show up.
[time=301] I won't fear, I won't fear what tomorrow brings.
[time=307] With each morning I'll rise and sing, my God's love will lead me through.
[time=316] You are the peace in my trouble, see, whoa.
[time=326] My lighthouse, my lighthouse, shining in the darkness.
[time=334] I will follow you, oh, my lighthouse, my lighthouse.
[time=341] I will trust the promise.
[time=343] You will carry me safe to show up, safe to show up, safe to show up, safe to show up.
[time=359] Fire before us, you're the brightest, you will lead us, safe to show up, fire before us,

[time=428] I will trust the promise, you will carry me safe to show up, safe to show up, safe to show up,
[time=440] safe to show up, safe to show up.
[time=448] All right, let's give a praise.
[time=450] Man.
[time=464] # In the name of the Father # # In the name of the Son # # In the name of the Spirit # # Lord, we come # # We're gathered together # # To lift up your name # # To call on our sail # # To follow on your race #
[time=512] # As your saints dial down # # As your people sing # # We will rise with you # # Lifting on your wings # # And the world will see them # # Our God says # # Our God says # # There is hope #
[time=541] # In your name # # In the name of the Father # # In the name of the Father # # In the name of the Son # # In the name of the Spirit # # Lord, we come # # We're gathered together # # To lift up your name # # To call on our sail # # To follow on your race #

[time=595] [MUSIC - 130 seconds]
[time=732] Hallelujah.
[time=733] That's right, Church, come on.
[time=735] We're joys in that today.
[time=737] He saves us.
[time=738] He leads us.
[time=740] He sends us.
[time=742] He invites us to serve for His purpose.
[time=745] So we're going to sing about giving ourselves to Him, asking Him to take our life, take our hands, take our voice.
[time=756] Let's sing.
[time=758] [MUSIC - 617 seconds]
[time=1381] And they will continue to meet a lot to us.
[time=1384] Thank you for being here this morning.
[time=1385] Would you pray with me?
[time=1386] Father, you are good.
[time=1398] Your love endures forever.
[time=1401] Your faithfulness is great.
[time=1403] Your mercies are new every morning.
[time=1406] You are our light and our salvation.
[time=1409] Whom shall we fear?
[time=1412] You have promised to be with us, God.
[time=1415] And I know that I can face a lot when I know that that's true.
[time=1420] And God, that will never, ever change.
[time=1426] You promised us, Father, your son Jesus promised us that he would be with us until the end of the age, never leaving us, never forsaking us.
[time=1435] And so, God, we run to that this morning.
[time=1440] We rally to the words of your son, Jesus, who loved us and gave himself for us.
[time=1446] I am so thankful, God, for all that you are doing in this place.
[time=1453] I am so thankful for your provision.
[time=1456] I'm thankful that your strength is made perfect in weakness.
[time=1460] And God, every need that we have as a church gathered,
[time=1466] we laid all before you this morning, trusting you, each and every step of the way.
[time=1472] Thank you, God, for my friends standing behind me that led us in worship.
[time=1477] Thank you that those words that we sang sustain us in transition times in our life.
[time=1483] Proud those things with great thanksgiving, in Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1489] I was telling Jonathan a few minutes ago that it seems appropriate to sing, be still my soul after we sing, take my life and let it be consecrated to you.
[time=1501] 'Cause that's a big thing.
[time=1503] To consecrate something is to set it aside for a divine purpose.
[time=1507] Dan Herman, a few minutes ago, formally declared to all of you that his life was set aside for a divine purpose.
[time=1516] That had already happened years ago in his life, but he declared it to all of you.
[time=1520] That's what baptism is in this place.
[time=1522] A formal declaration, a consecration of a person's life.
[time=1526] I'm gonna pray that we have to rearrange a bunch of church services in the days to accommodate all the baptisms.
[time=1534] Would you pray with me that way?
[time=1536] That God would just do that.
[time=1538] If you believe in Jesus, if he has, if he's your savior, your Lord, please don't deprive us of the church body of celebrating with you like you celebrated with Dan this morning and his family.
[time=1550] It's a step of obedience to tell people that you are not what you used to be, that you are a new creation from 2 Corinthians chapter five.
[time=1558] What a wonderful thing that would be for us to participate with you in that way to celebrate what God has done.
[time=1566] I'm so grateful to be part of this place, to commission missionaries to baptize people, to rejoice in what God has done.
[time=1577] This morning, we're gonna be in 2 Corinthians chapter eight.
[time=1579] If you have a bulletin, there are some notes and they're that you're welcome to follow along as we progress this morning.
[time=1587] I wanna just rally around one thing today and I wanna tell you a little story.
[time=1591] I'll tell you the main idea first and then I'll tell you a story.
[time=1596] I'm gonna come back this a few times today because if you forget everything else you can remember this and I can be comfortable with that.
[time=1604] Here's the main idea from this morning from 2 Corinthians chapter eight.
[time=1607] The main idea is this, it should be on the screens behind me.
[time=1612] The proper and right response to the grace of God is sacrificial, obedient service.
[time=1630] Please notice the order.
[time=1633] It is not that we sacrificially, obediently serve and God gives us grace.
[time=1639] God gives us grace and in response to that grace, we serve, we obey.
[time=1645] When I was in India not long ago, I got to preach at the church there and tell them the story of the 10 commandments.
[time=1654] They found that X is 20 and other place in the Old Testament.
[time=1658] X is 20 begins, friends, this way, listen to this.
[time=1662] It begins, God spoke all these words saying, I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt out of the house of slavery and then begins a whole series of you shall.
[time=1674] As it was with the people of Israel in the Old Testament, as it was with the Corinthians friends as it is with us, God delivered his people first and in response to that deliverance, they obeyed him.
[time=1689] Christianity is not a story of do your best, clean yourself up, work harder, obey more and then God will receive you.
[time=1700] He knows that you are a mess.
[time=1701] He compels you to come to him and he will clean you up.
[time=1705] And then in response to that, you can serve him.
[time=1708] I've told you before that Ephesians 2, 10 comes after Ephesians 2, 8, and 9.
[time=1714] You're welcome for that again.
[time=1715] We are his workmanship.
[time=1718] Verse 10 says, created in Christ Jesus for, good works.
[time=1723] But before that, as you know, comes those famous verses for by grace you have been saved through faith and this not of yourselves, it's a gift of God.
[time=1735] We are prone, every one of us who's been around the church or the Bible for a long time.
[time=1741] We are prone to rest as we should in some ways in the grace of God that I'm good.
[time=1747] I've got God's grace and that's done, good.
[time=1752] We are prone and we are appropriately nervous about working to earn God's grace.
[time=1757] Dallas Woolard said it this way.
[time=1759] Grace isn't opposed to effort, it's opposed to earning.
[time=1763] And that's important dynamic friends.
[time=1766] That's all over this passage in 2 Corinthians 8.
[time=1769] The back story for this chapter, for the whole letter, this is our last Sunday in Corinthians, we've had a whirlwind summer through Paul's letters to 1st and 2nd Corinthians.
[time=1779] These people needed a lot of help.
[time=1781] In fact, the whole message of 2nd Corinthians, which begins in chapter one, you wanna go back there from minute to chapter one of 2nd Corinthians, you'll see this word all over the place in chapter one, and the word is comfort.
[time=1794] I pray that God would give you comfort, be the God of all comfort, be the comfort others as you over and over and over again.
[time=1800] A dozen times or more, they needed comfort, they were facing incredible hardship.
[time=1806] I know, I know, some of you are facing that hardship today.
[time=1813] I know that you're facing it head on as a family,
[time=1820] individually, I've talked with you about it this past week, and I wanna give you comfort today, not fake comfort, not waving my hands around, no slight of hand, real comfort that comes from God's own hand, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, he loved you and he gave himself for you, and because that really did happen, you can face what you're facing tomorrow, he can provide you with comfort, the Holy Spirit is a companion that will accompany you and guide you and protect you and go with you every step of the way.
[time=1859] Friends, I could not stand before you if that were not true, I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it, but it is, it's true.
[time=1867] Jesus Christ has risen from the dead and stands ready with power each and every day to give you exactly what you need.
[time=1876] The fruit of the Spirit is love and joy and peace and patience and kindness and goodness and gentleness and self-control, and all those things are available to you because he really did come, he really did die, he really did rise again.
[time=1891] And that will never change, things change around us
[time=1897] every day, it is really hard to watch the news, it is really hard to watch it, the world is falling apart at the seams.
[time=1910] And in all that uncertainty and all that struggle and all that strife, I run to what I know.
[time=1916] And what I know is that Jesus is on the throne and that will never change.
[time=1924] I told some friends in my last Wednesday that the new Jerusalem will never be under threat, no siege towers will ever go up against it.
[time=1932] It's what's made of gold and pearls and precious gems 'cause nobody will ever enter to steal it, that will be gone when disappointment, grief and fear are gone and we'll meet at last, we're just saying that.
[time=1947] That's a promise friends and that can break into the here and now 'cause 2 Corinthians 5 is our friend Kelly told us last week, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[time=1957] So new creation is a future reality that we're gonna experience someday, glorious, amazing wonder, but it breaks into the here and now when a person knows Jesus, when a person knows Jesus.
[time=1968] Now I'm gonna talk for a little bit and then John's gonna come back up and we'll sing some more.
[time=1972] At the very end of our service, if you need to come up and talk to someone, the elders are in the room, you saw all of them up here earlier.
[time=1978] If you wanna talk to us about anything at all, if it can be a blessing to you or you can pray with you, I don't wanna forget to say it, so please come up after the service and just let us pray with you and be an encouragement and comfort truly to you.
[time=1990] Main idea of the passage, again, watch this.
[time=1993] The proper and right response to the grace of God is sacrificial, obedient service.
[time=1998] Second Corinthians chapter eight, friends, would you go there, please?
[time=2000] Read a couple verses here.
[time=2003] We want you to know, brothers and sisters about the grace of God that's been given among the churches of Macedonia.
[time=2012] Macedonia is, and there's two places that Paul talks about in chapter eight, Macedonia and Achaia.
[time=2018] Those are two different regions.
[time=2019] They're basically modern-day Greece and Macedonia was in the north and Achaia is where Corinth is to the south.
[time=2026] In a severe test of affliction, watch this.
[time=2030] In a severe test of affliction, there, the Macedonians, abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.
[time=2044] Hand in hand in this verse is abundance of joy and extreme poverty.
[time=2051] Great affliction, great generosity.
[time=2055] That's a record scratcher.
[time=2057] Like, what?
[time=2058] That doesn't go together.
[time=2060] Look back at verse one, friends.
[time=2063] There's a word I would invite you, if you're writing your Bibles, I'd invite you to circle it, to underline it, to draw attention to it.
[time=2069] And it's in verse one of chapter eight and the word is this.
[time=2071] We want you to know.
[time=2077] What you know is powerful.
[time=2083] John 17, Jesus says to his disciples, he says this.
[time=2087] I made known to them your name and I will continue to make it known.
[time=2094] That's the same word for know in 2 Corinthians chapter eight.
[time=2097] It's not like, oh yeah, I know.
[time=2099] Isn't that sure?
[time=2100] It's no.
[time=2102] I won't bore you with the original language, but it's a word that means to settle down.
[time=2106] It's a consistent word.
[time=2108] And I want to encourage you with this this morning.
[time=2111] It's number one in your outline, ready?
[time=2114] That you can sacrificially serve in response to the grace of God, number one, despite circumstances, despite circumstances.
[time=2123] Do you notice how these people's behavior was totally unplugged from their circumstances?
[time=2130] Why?
[time=2132] Because what they know guides how they feel.
[time=2137] And we are very, very prone friends to flip that around.
[time=2141] That I feel all these things.
[time=2143] And so I behave in all kinds of maybe unhelpful ways to people around me.
[time=2148] But what I know needs to drive the bus.
[time=2152] Don't let your feelings drive the bus.
[time=2154] I told it to you before.
[time=2155] I'll say it to you again.
[time=2156] Feelings should not drive the bus.
[time=2158] My kids have a book called Don't the Pigeon Drive the Bus.
[time=2161] I'll morph that.
[time=2163] Don't let your feelings drive the bus.
[time=2165] They are not good drivers.
[time=2167] You'll end up with some very, very strange neighborhoods.
[time=2171] I want to encourage you this morning that what Paul begins I want you to know and what you know should guide every bit of your experience.
[time=2180] But we live in a culture that flips that around.
[time=2182] And so all these things that we experience they all, it's a dangerous way to live.
[time=2188] And it's very easy to fall into.
[time=2190] But my encouragement to you this morning again is to begin where Paul begins and to know things.
[time=2195] That what you know can help you to experience all the hardship that you are experiencing today.
[time=2200] If all you have in front of you are circumstances and it will be very, very foggy.
[time=2207] That's why we need a lighthouse.
[time=2209] The Lord is my light.
[time=2210] I prayed that with you, friends.
[time=2211] Our light, our salvation.
[time=2214] That's true.
[time=2216] If I know that, then whatever comes my way, I can face it.
[time=2220] If all I see are a series of obstacles and I forget that God's my light and my salvation, that my help comes from the hells, the maker of heaven and earth, I can face whatever it is I'm facing.
[time=2231] I know that some of you are facing incredibly difficult things.
[time=2234] And you can face them if you know those things.
[time=2237] If you know that, deeply, deeply together.
[time=2242] We want you to know, Buzz, about the grace of God.
[time=2248] Verse one, that's been given in the churches of Macedonia.
[time=2251] In a severe test of affliction, there are abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.
[time=2260] They gave verse three according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means of their own accord, freely, voluntarily.
[time=2272] That is the way that giving goes in ministry, or it should.
[time=2275] Nobody from this church will ever strong army you, or browbeat you, or guilt trip you into giving.
[time=2282] God's word is very clear.
[time=2285] More on that in a few minutes.
[time=2286] Verse four, the people of Macedonia begged us earnestly
[time=2292] for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints.
[time=2295] There was a huge problem in the church in Jerusalem.
[time=2298] They had a great need.
[time=2301] They were in great distress.
[time=2303] And Paul goes to these people and says, "There is a great need that you can meet." And the people of Macedonia responded.
[time=2310] And in Romans, Paul talks about it.
[time=2311] In Romans 15, he talks about how he went to go deliver that news.
[time=2314] His message got through, spoiler alert, to the people in Corinth, and they responded, with great generosity.
[time=2321] Let me pause for a moment on that front.
[time=2325] Friends, you are famous all over the world for your generosity as the church.
[time=2333] You are famous for it.
[time=2334] The best example I can give you that is your behavior the last few years toward as our own.
[time=2341] You are famous for your generosity, and more than that, more than that, the Lord's name is made famous because of you.
[time=2350] You saw a need with these precious girls.
[time=2355] I've been there.
[time=2357] I've seen them where they would live had they not been rescued.
[time=2361] It's terrifying.
[time=2364] The reality they would face, you saw the need, and you responded with overwhelming generosity like the Macedonians responded to Paul's call, "Tell the church in Jerusalem." Friends, I am so grateful.
[time=2378] This isn't just a theoretical thing for you that you've known it, that you've seen it.
[time=2382] Your family's got involved in it.
[time=2385] It's changed our lives for the better.
[time=2388] It will keep changing our lives.
[time=2389] Much more on this in the days to come.
[time=2391] You'll have another chance in December to talk about it and to give.
[time=2395] I'm so grateful for you that this overflowing generosity isn't like, well, in theory, I hear it happen someplace.
[time=2401] It's actually happened here among you.
[time=2403] I'm grateful for that.
[time=2404] On that front, let me say this.
[time=2408] The need here in this place in Black Hawk Ministries is great.
[time=2413] We have great need, not around the world.
[time=2417] Great need here so we can help around the world.
[time=2420] Maybe it's your time.
[time=2424] Maybe it's your treasure.
[time=2425] Whatever you have to give, whatever you have to offer, I promise you the need here is great.
[time=2430] You hear a lot more about that in the days to come to.
[time=2433] If you call this church home, this is your family.
[time=2435] If you're listening, if you're from the sound of my voice, I encourage you to plug in and to remember what it is that God's done and if you're blessed by this place and there's no shortage of chances for you to be a blessing in whatever way that you can.
[time=2447] People think in a big church sometimes that, well, I don't, they don't need me.
[time=2451] Nothing can be further from the truth.
[time=2454] By the way, your elders in the bulletin today, their names are in there, their emails are in there.
[time=2462] Guys, there's cell numbers are in there.
[time=2465] It's unheard of.
[time=2466] You are being led by faithful, trustworthy men.
[time=2469] And we are, they are laboring diligently day by day to serve the Lord in this place.
[time=2476] And that opportunity for you to give to the work of the ministry here has never been greater and I encourage you on that front, whatever that giving looks like for you, in light of what God has done.
[time=2486] Verse five.
[time=2488] And this, not as we expected, they gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us.
[time=2495] Paul was always facing accusation.
[time=2497] Ministry was hard for Paul.
[time=2499] Ministry is hard, period.
[time=2500] And on that front, let me stop for a minute and tell you this.
[time=2504] You have told us time and again that you are praying for us.
[time=2511] And Chris Lyles tweeted last hour that if you tell me you're praying for me, I will run through a wall.
[time=2517] That's not what I said.
[time=2518] I said, I feel like I could.
[time=2520] Just to be clear, I told some guys this morning that I feel like I could run the 40-yard dash in like four seconds, but I can't.
[time=2528] But I feel like I could when they tell me that you're praying for us, please don't stop praying for us.
[time=2534] There is no greater encouragement than you know what that feels like when someone tells you they're praying for you.
[time=2538] You know what that, I told you that before from this pulpit.
[time=2540] I'm grateful I've been here for a long time to share it with you again and again.
[time=2543] Thank you for your prayers.
[time=2545] Please don't stop.
[time=2546] I think about Nehemiah.
[time=2548] And Nehemiah would turn back to Jerusalem to rebuild the wall around the city.
[time=2552] And it says that he prayed to God and posted a guard.
[time=2557] Not one or the other, but both.
[time=2559] He prayed, but his prayer was met with action.
[time=2562] You might say that we were called by God to do something together in the light of God's grace, not to earn God's grace in light of the grace of God that he's given.
[time=2573] [AMEN] First to the Lord, then to us.
[time=2578] That's the order, always.
[time=2580] But Paul sees no daylight between himself and Jesus.
[time=2583] You call him for the ministry, and so he's doing the work that God wants him to do.
[time=2587] In verse six is a guy's name Titus there.
[time=2588] We urged Titus that as he started, so he should complete among you this act of grace.
[time=2595] Titus is a real person.
[time=2596] There's a book named, never guess what the book is called.
[time=2599] It's called Titus, you're welcome, about Titus.
[time=2603] He's a pastor of a church in a place called Crete, it's an island, it's still there.
[time=2607] So when I share with you things like, God will be there to comfort you in your time of need.
[time=2614] That's not just, again, slight of hand, because Titus is a real person.
[time=2620] Who knows Paul, who met Jesus, who loved you and gave himself for you.
[time=2625] Real things happening in real history, friends.
[time=2627] So the Bible offers real comfort to people, not fake generic comfort, but specific comfort to you.
[time=2633] Real people living in real time.
[time=2635] Like Titus, who was a major encouragement to Paul.
[time=2638] He's a fellow worker with him, laboring together to bring comfort and aid to people and to encourage them to do good things.
[time=2647] Verse seven, as you excel in everything, in faith, in speech, in knowledge, and in all earnestness.
[time=2653] In our love for you, see that you excel in this act of grace also.
[time=2660] Paul talks about the grace of God all over this passage, which leads me to section two, that wrote number two in your outline.
[time=2667] So again, despite circumstances, you can serve and in response to God's grace despite your circumstances, you can do it.
[time=2675] Number two, you can do it with enthusiasm.
[time=2681] Paul uses the word earnestness in this passage.
[time=2685] It's important.
[time=2686] You can do it joyfully.
[time=2688] That's what he says in chapter nine.
[time=2690] I was there with you last November, I'm not sure if you remember that or not.
[time=2692] We talked about Second Corinthians nine, the last November, and now I'm chapter eight here in August, so.
[time=2697] It's okay.
[time=2699] A joyful giver, a cheerful giver, right?
[time=2702] In chapter nine.
[time=2703] Verse eight, I say this to you, people in Corinth, not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine.
[time=2715] Verse nine is the most important verse in this entire chapter.
[time=2718] And I encourage you to make much of it in your Bibles if you like to write that down somewhere, that eight verse nine is by no doubt the key verse in this passage.
[time=2727] Listen, friends, to what God says, for you what?
[time=2733] You know, there it is again.
[time=2737] What you know, for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, Philippians who says though he was in the form of God didn't kind of quality of God and thing to be grasped but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant being born in the likeness of men.
[time=2758] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yeah for your sake he became poor, that you by his poverty might become rich.
[time=2768] That is the basis of everything that Paul says to these people and by virtue of that, friends everything that he says to you by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2776] That this motivates all of our faithful service.
[time=2779] The grace of God lavished on us in the person of Jesus Christ, that loved you enough to be made nothing to empty himself, to experience poverty.
[time=2789] I mentioned to you before, again, he didn't have to come as a baby, as a helpless, needy infant, but he did.
[time=2800] No greater act of humiliation could be imagined and he did it for you.
[time=2805] The Bible says that he did it for you.
[time=2808] Out of love, greater love has no one than this,
[time=2815] that a man laid out his life for his friends and every bit of his action and service towards you was because motivated by love for you.
[time=2821] I know that you don't feel loved.
[time=2825] I know that you don't feel sometimes like it's all like, like that's true, but rest in what you know when you don't feel that way.
[time=2834] Rest in what you know.
[time=2838] And that is true.
[time=2839] That Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners and he did.
[time=2843] Look at verse 12 with me of chapter eight.
[time=2849] If the readiness is there, it's acceptable according to what a person has.
[time=2854] If the readiness is there, it's not a guarantee, it's not magic.
[time=2861] God has done all these things and asks you to respond.
[time=2864] And there is a freedom there that you might not, tragically.
[time=2869] If your readiness is there, Paul's not no compulsory stuff, no forcing people, no coercion, please give out of your own free will.
[time=2881] Give because you want to give.
[time=2883] And he defends his integrity.
[time=2886] What I've done is known to you, you guys know who I am.
[time=2889] The elders have made themselves known to you.
[time=2893] You know who they are?
[time=2895] So you can give it to clear conscience, knowing these men are faithfully serving you in this place and the Lord.
[time=2900] I don't mean that verse 13, that others should be eased and you burdened, but as a matter of fairness, your abundance, verse 14, at the present time, should supply their need, that their abundance may supply your need, that there would be fairness.
[time=2917] As it is written, Exodus 16, "Whoever gathered much had nothing left over, "and whoever gathered little had no lack." That's from Exodus 16 and the story of the manna that God gave from heaven.
[time=2929] You remember that story?
[time=2930] God literally rained bread from the sky for his people when they were in need.
[time=2935] Dear friends, if God can do that, no.
[time=2942] Since God can do that, he can meet your need.
[time=2946] He made bread fall from the sky.
[time=2948] Whoever they gathered more than they could possibly ever need.
[time=2954] And that was for his people that he had delivered from Egypt.
[time=2959] The deliverance had already happened and God provided for their every need.
[time=2962] And now in the second Exodus, led by our King Jesus, out of darkness and to light, will provide for you too.
[time=2971] Paul promises that here.
[time=2972] Number three in your outline.
[time=2977] Number three, it's accomplished together.
[time=2980] It is done, friends, despite circumstances, this act of service.
[time=2986] It is done with enthusiasm, with eagerness, with diligence.
[time=2992] And number three, it's accomplished together.
[time=2994] I did a wedding right here, yesterday, right here.
[time=2997] I'll say it right in this very spot.
[time=3000] And I said that marriage is a community project.
[time=3003] It's true.
[time=3005] In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, in the name of the Spirit.
[time=3009] I said those words yesterday.
[time=3011] And God has always lived as a person, as three persons in community.
[time=3019] And wants us to live in community too.
[time=3021] So even the very nature of God revealed in his word.
[time=3024] One God, three persons.
[time=3025] He lives in community and wants us to be together.
[time=3029] And it's wonderful to watch.
[time=3031] It's wonderful to be a part of.
[time=3033] That even God's very nature is an example to us of how we should live too.
[time=3037] Accomplished together, verse 16.
[time=3040] Thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same earnest, enthusiastic, genuine care I have for you.
[time=3049] God gets the credit.
[time=3052] God put it into Titus' heart.
[time=3054] So God gets the credit.
[time=3055] God gets the glory.
[time=3056] Keep reading.
[time=3057] Verse 17.
[time=3059] He not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest, very eager, very excited, very genuine.
[time=3064] He's going to you of his own accord, freely.
[time=3067] With him, we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches.
[time=3072] No one knows who that is.
[time=3073] Verse 18.
[time=3073] Just thought I'd mention it.
[time=3076] For his preaching of the gospel.
[time=3077] I wish we didn't know, but nobody knows.
[time=3078] Verse 19.
[time=3079] Not only that, but he's been appointed by the churches to travel with us, to carry out this act of grace.
[time=3085] There's that phrase again.
[time=3087] Being ministered by us for the glory of the Lord himself, the ultimate end of any service that we do is God receiving glory.
[time=3095] Accomplished together.
[time=3097] Verse 21.
[time=3098] We aim at what is honorable, not only in the Lord's sight,
[time=3104] but also in the sight of man.
[time=3107] I can't tell you how important this is.
[time=3110] What is honorable in the Lord's sight and in the sight of man.
[time=3115] It is important what you say.
[time=3117] It is also important how you say it.
[time=3120] It is important what you do.
[time=3121] It's also important why you do it.
[time=3123] Romans 14 says this.
[time=3129] For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
[time=3138] Whoever thus serves Christ, is acceptable to God and approved by men.
[time=3143] Let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual up building.
[time=3147] That's what God wants us to do.
[time=3149] Mutually up build each other.
[time=3151] And in conclusion friends, I'll read with you first Peter chapter two, verse 12.
[time=3156] Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable.
[time=3163] That when they speak against you as evil doers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.
[time=3173] This is called before us to live out this great service in the light of God's grace and to do that friends despite our circumstances.
[time=3183] To do it enthusiastically, genuinely, authentically,
[time=3190] and to do it together.
[time=3192] (gentle music)
