[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=35] My name is Stephen Webster, you may have seen my face before here from time to time.
[time=41] I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and I've been privileged and honored to do that for a few years now.
[time=47] Grateful to be part of a team that loves and cares for people that's interested in people's lives.
[time=54] Again, in meeting them, not where they once were or where they should be, but where they are today, we want you to know that we are incredibly glad that
[time=64] you're watching today.
[time=65] We have always and still to this day believe that you as a viewing audience
[time=71] are very much a part of our family.
[time=73] We are grateful that you watch.
[time=75] We love to hear from you when you tell us that you're watching and we're grateful, again, for you to be a part of our family, to be engaged with what we're doing here.
[time=84] We're so grateful to have been doing this for such a long time and we're going to keep doing it with great sincerity and great enthusiasm.
[time=92] As I mentioned earlier, friends, if you would write us and tell us that you're watching, and tell us how you're encouraged, tell us what you need.
[time=99] You are a part of our family and so as you have needs, write to us.
[time=103] You can call us at church offices.
[time=105] You can follow us on Twitter to be more engaged day by day with what's coming up and what's going on in our community.
[time=112] We are a family here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=115] We're in a season of change and so you'll be hearing more from myself and from other people in the days to come about what the change looks like.
[time=123] We went through a series not long ago, as you might remember, called The Land Between.
[time=127] And every one of us finds ourselves there in some way or another.
[time=130] And as a church, we're in that season now trusting God with our whole hearts that He has a great plan for you and for this place as we faithfully serve Him day by day.
[time=142] This morning what you're going to see in the service was a tremendous blessing to us.
[time=147] It was a same service or a pause service in between sermon series.
[time=151] We finished a series just recently on First and Second Corinthians called Life Together.
[time=156] Tremendous encouragement to hear from Paul there as he administered to this people that were really struggling with some serious and I think very timely questions.
[time=165] This morning is going to be a baptism and communion service.
[time=170] Those are two of the sacraments that we as a church celebrate.
[time=174] That word means that they're special to us, they're set apart, they mean something.
[time=178] Jesus commanded His disciples to go into the world to make disciples to baptize them.
[time=183] So it's an act of obedience that we are trying to pursue.
[time=187] And you'll see that at work in our body this morning.
[time=190] And it will be explained to you, but I'll just mention it a little bit as we start this morning.
[time=194] Communion is a physical representation, a symbolic recreation of the death and burial of Jesus.
[time=202] He enacted his last night with his disciples.
[time=205] He told them to do it.
[time=207] And as often as they did it, it was to be done a remembrance of him.
[time=210] It was a connection to what he did for those people in real space and time.
[time=217] So it's good that we do it regularly to celebrate the Lord's death, to proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[time=223] That's why we do it together.
[time=225] Baptism is another physical representation of what's already happened in a person's life
[time=231] who's come to know Jesus as their Savior.
[time=234] They're buried in the waters of baptism, in the likeness of his death, raised in the likeness of his resurrection.
[time=240] So it's a powerful testimony.
[time=242] You get to hear today about these stories.
[time=244] Today it's kids who have responded by faith to the call of Christ in their lives to love and to serve him.
[time=252] This is a public declaration that I'm going to follow Jesus.
[time=256] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=258] What a marvelous encouragement.
[time=260] I hope you'll be encouraged as encouraged as we were to watch it take place this morning.
[time=265] And lastly, I wanted to mention to you real quickly that coming up in September throughout the course of the next few months,
[time=271] we're beginning a series in 1 Timothy.
[time=274] Paul writes the letter to 1 Timothy, much like he wrote the letter to the Corinthians.
[time=279] Timothy is a personal letter from one person to another.
[time=282] Timothy was a young pastor struggling with leading this congregation of people that were confused about a lot of things.
[time=288] In the middle of the first century, there was a lot of confusion about what the gospel actually was.
[time=294] As you read 1 Timothy, and please do in the days to come read it as we are together, day by day.
[time=301] You'll see in the letter that Timothy is struggling with false teaching.
[time=304] There's the true gospel and there are counterfeit gospels.
[time=307] And it doesn't take too much time to realize that's very timely for us today as well.
[time=313] There's lots of false teaching going on.
[time=315] So Paul tells Timothy what you received from me was trustworthy because Paul got it from Christ himself.
[time=321] So you can trust me, Timothy, that what I'm sharing with you is the true authentic gospel.
[time=326] Pass on, Paul says to Timothy, pass it on to faithful men that can help you in the ministry, help lead it in that way.
[time=333] So trustworthiness is a real theme that we'll see there as we try to live out what it means to live in real authentic ways following after Jesus.
[time=342] The series is called Live It Out, and we couldn't be more excited to see what God's going to do as we hear from God in these letters that Paul wrote.
[time=351] We believe as Paul says in 2 Timothy that all scripture is breathed out by God and is faithful and it is useful and profitable for teaching and for correction for all manner of things.
[time=362] That is our confidence.
[time=363] And that's going to be the way that we approach the series.
[time=365] We approach teaching on Sunday mornings as long as this place is standing.
[time=370] We're going to commit ourselves to teaching faithfully what God's word says.
[time=373] So again, thank you for watching.
[time=375] Please come and visit us.
[time=376] Please write to us.
[time=377] Please call us.
[time=378] Follow us on Twitter.
[time=380] We're so grateful that you're watching and that you're part of our family.
[time=382] And we look forward to seeing you very, very soon.

[time=513] Glory to God sing.

[time=926] [MUSIC] Leave me to the cross [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC] You were his eye [MUSIC] To take a drive [MUSIC] You were his eye [MUSIC] To take a drive [MUSIC] You were his eye [MUSIC] But my sin and death [MUSIC] Now your reason [MUSIC][MUSIC] Everything I want said dear [MUSIC] I count it all as a loss [MUSIC] And lead me to the cross [MUSIC] Where your love poured out [MUSIC] Bring me to my knees [MUSIC] Lord I let me down [MUSIC] Bid me of myself [MUSIC] I belong to you [MUSIC] Leave me [MUSIC] Leave me to the cross [MUSIC] And say lead me to your heart [MUSIC] Into your heart [MUSIC] Into your heart [MUSIC] Into your heart [MUSIC] Into your heart [MUSIC] Lead me to the cross [MUSIC] Where your love poured out [MUSIC] Bring me to my knees [MUSIC] Lord I let me down [MUSIC] Bid me of myself [MUSIC] I belong to you [MUSIC] Leave me [MUSIC] And lead me to the cross [MUSIC] Where your love poured out [MUSIC] Bring me to my knees [MUSIC] Lord I let me down [MUSIC] Bid me of myself [MUSIC] I belong to you [MUSIC] Leave me [MUSIC] Leave me to the cross [MUSIC]
[time=1093] Listen, I will tell you a mystery.
[time=1097] We will not all die, but we will all be changed.
[time=1101] In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.
[time=1114] For this perishable body must be made imperishable.
[time=1118] And this mortal body must be made in mortality.
[time=1123] When this perishable body puts on imperishable ability, and this mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will be fulfilled.
[time=1134] Death has swallowed up in victory.
[time=1137] Where Odeth is your victory?
[time=1140] Where death is your sting?
[time=1142] The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
[time=1147] But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.
[time=1153] Therefore, my beloved, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord, because you know that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.
[time=1166] So then, just as you received Christ as Lord, continue to live your lives in Him, rooted and built up in Him.
[time=1174] Strengthen in the faith as you were taught and overflowing with thankfulness.
[time=1179] See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ.
[time=1192] For in Christ, all the fullness of the deity lives in bodily form, and in Christ you have been brought to fullness.
[time=1200] He is the head over every power and authority.
[time=1203] In Him, you are also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands.
[time=1210] Your whole self, ruled by the flesh, was put off when you were circumcised by Christ, having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised with Him through your faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.
[time=1228] When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive in Christ.
[time=1235] He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us.
[time=1245] He has taken it away, nailing it to the cross, and having disarmed the powers and authorities, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.
[time=1268] [MUSIC]
[time=1277] I sing with me, this is my revelation.
[time=1279] [MUSIC]
[time=1282] This is my revelation, Christ Jesus crucified.
[time=1288] [MUSIC]
[time=1293] Salvation through repentance, at the cross in which He died.
[time=1299] [MUSIC]
[time=1305] I fear my absolution, forgiveness for my sin.
[time=1311] [MUSIC]
[time=1316] And I see beneath the waters, that the rice was buried in.
[time=1322] [MUSIC]
[time=1325] I will rise, say, I will rise, I will rise, as Christ was raised to life.
[time=1338] Now in Him, now in Him, I live.
[time=1349] [MUSIC]
[time=1352] I stand to new creation, baptized in blood and fire.
[time=1358] [MUSIC]
[time=1363] No fear of condemnation, by faith and justified.
[time=1369] I will rise, say, I will rise, I will rise, as Christ was raised to life.
[time=1384] Now in Him, now in Him, I live.
[time=1395] And I will rise, I will rise, as Christ was raised to life.
[time=1407] Now in Him, now in Him, I live.
[time=1418] [MUSIC]
[time=1422] Now we're going to do some baptisms.
[time=1425] And we just wanted to share a little bit about what baptism is, as this family of believers has come together.
[time=1431] We have decided that this is how we believe the scriptures have taught about baptism.
[time=1435] Baptism is the physical testimony of a believer's relationship to Christ.
[time=1439] That song we're just saying is a great song picturing that baptism is this picture of death and burial of Christ,
[time=1445] being lowered into the water, and the resurrection of Christ being raised out of the water.
[time=1450] Baptism pictures that we are dead to ourselves, but alive in Christ.
[time=1456] And that in Christ is when someone decides to give their life to Jesus.
[time=1462] When they make that decision, when they pray that prayer, however that comes to happen in somebody's life, you become in Christ.
[time=1469] And at that moment, the Holy Spirit fills you and seals you for eternity, your His.
[time=1474] And all the things and all the blessings and all the promises are true of you.
[time=1478] You are in Christ.
[time=1480] And this baptism we're going to see is a symbol of that.
[time=1483] We believe that only believers should be baptized because in the scriptures only believers were baptized.
[time=1489] We believe that baptism is done by immersion.
[time=1491] The word baptize means to dip.
[time=1494] We're going to see that today.
[time=1496] It's a picture of burial.
[time=1498] It was the habit of the early church.
[time=1500] It's a ritual that's been happening.
[time=1502] Jesus Himself was baptized.
[time=1504] And these people who are going to be baptized, these four students have given their life to Christ.
[time=1510] They want to follow Him.
[time=1512] They've committed to following Him.
[time=1514] They're in Christ.
[time=1516] And now as duty baker comes and they come into the tank, you will see this picture of baptism just unfold this morning.
[time=1524] Hello everyone.
[time=1527] As Jesse said, I'm duty baker.
[time=1529] If you don't know me, I have a privilege to lead and oversee the middle school and high school ministry.
[time=1535] Along with my wife Andrea and our great team that God has put together.
[time=1539] We have some students here that want to be baptized.
[time=1542] It's a very joyous occasion.
[time=1544] And so first we're going to bring in Gabriel Connolly.
[time=1547] His family's going to come in as well a little bit.
[time=1551] Morning Gabriel.
[time=1553] How you doing?
[time=1555] So what grade are you in, Gabriel? Just for the church.
[time=1559] Fifth grade, fifth grade.
[time=1561] And when was it when you came to your mom and dad and had that discussion about giving your life to Christ?
[time=1567] About six or seven.
[time=1569] Six or seven, yeah.
[time=1571] And Gabriel now understands you want to be baptized out of obedience.
[time=1575] And you want to follow Christ for a lifetime.
[time=1578] You're serious about this, aren't you?
[time=1580] Your dad told me they've had some very serious discussions.
[time=1583] This isn't something Gabriel is just doing, just to do.
[time=1587] So it encourages my heart to see such a young guy just wanting to make a difference.
[time=1594] He wants to live differently.
[time=1596] So that right there just should encourage all of us that no matter how young the person is,
[time=1603] they can have an understanding that they want to be different than the world says.
[time=1607] He wants to live for Christ.
[time=1609] So that's encouraging.
[time=1610] Gabriel, come right over here.
[time=1613] Go ahead and hold on to me.
[time=1615] With your mom and dad present and all the church family together, it is now my honor and privilege to baptize you, the name of God, the Father, and God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
[time=1640] All right.
[time=1646] Yeah, Macy, coming in.
[time=1648] Welcome, Macy, everyone.
[time=1656] This is Macy Banks, and she is going to share her story that she has written out.
[time=1661] So go ahead, Macy.
[time=1662] My name is Macy Ryan Banks, and I was born on January 16, 2003.
[time=1668] I am a sixth grader at Leola Elementary School.
[time=1671] I live with my mom, my dad, and my sister Maddie, and my sister Reese.
[time=1674] My favorite things to do are cheerleading, hanging out with my friends and family, and eat tacos.
[time=1679] I started attending Black Hawk when I was little.
[time=1681] I am very fortunate that God has always been a part of my life.
[time=1685] In the summer, I was old enough to start attending liquid, and that's where I heard duty announced that there was going to be a baptism.
[time=1691] I knew immediately that God was calling me to participate.
[time=1694] I am making a conscious effort to live my life the way God wants me to.
[time=1698] I want to be baptized because I want to come closer to God.
[time=1701] [AMEN] Thanks, Macy.
[time=1707] Macy said in her story that she is making a conscious decision to live for Jesus.
[time=1716] And as Jessie said before, that's what it's about, living for the Lord.
[time=1721] And Macy was in our baptism class.
[time=1724] And we had discussions about what that looks like.
[time=1727] She's actively searching out ways she can be differently.
[time=1731] She can live different in the world.
[time=1733] And that just warmed my heart as well just to hear that.
[time=1736] Sixth grader, right?
[time=1737] Yeah.
[time=1738] Yeah, Leo.
[time=1739] All right, you ready, Macy?
[time=1740] Yeah.
[time=1741] Okay.
[time=1742] In front of your church family, in front of your mom and dad right now, it's now my honor and privilege to baptize you.
[time=1750] And the name of God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1781] Who's next?
[time=1783] All right, guys.
[time=1784] Welcome, Casey.
[time=1785] Hey, Casey.
[time=1793] Casey's going to also read her story.
[time=1797] I come from the worst family.
[time=1799] No, really.
[time=1800] My name is Casey Wurst, daughter to Charles and Katherine Wurst, and older sister to Elizabeth, Anna, and Hayley Wurst.
[time=1806] I am currently a senior at Black Cup Christian High School, which I have been attending since my third grade year.
[time=1811] I enjoy laughing, reading, writing, hiking, and spending time with my family and friends.
[time=1816] Well, that's enough about me.
[time=1818] Let's talk about Christ.
[time=1820] I truly believe God has an ultimate intricate plan for everything that happens in our lives.
[time=1824] When I was eight years old, he took my birth mother, Emily, away from my father's sister and me.
[time=1829] It was a very sad time, full of many tears and much love.
[time=1832] Even through that, my Jesus was working.
[time=1835] A couple years later, my father and married to Katherine, who introduced us to the Black Hawk family.
[time=1841] Coming from a Catholic background, I was shocked to see the differences between Catholic and Baptist ways of worship and testifying.
[time=1847] Though I believe both ways glorify God in their core, this church has truly helped me flourish in my knowledge and set truth about who Jesus is and what following Him looks like.
[time=1856] However, I didn't always use this knowledge to its full potential.
[time=1860] To be honest, I was afraid of losing myself in Christ.
[time=1863] I wanted to be my own person, interesting in my own way, needed and loved because of who I was as a unique person.
[time=1869] Basically, I wanted to make Christ a part of my life, while still hanging on to my old ways and loves.
[time=1875] But He has taught me that He is my life.
[time=1877] He brought me to a point last year.
[time=1879] I was definitely one of the lowest points in my life.
[time=1882] I was a slave to entertainment, my desire to please others, and my wish to be solely capable of myself.
[time=1887] My life was frustrating and confusing, so I wish to escape more than anything.
[time=1892] I turned to entertainment.
[time=1894] I don't think we as a society notice how addicting and controlling the media is to our minds and lives.
[time=1899] We desire the great fantasies of movies, television, books, and music over reality.
[time=1904] How then can we take hold of the great treasures Christ has for us in reality if we are constantly wrapped up in fantasy lands?
[time=1912] Because of my constant consumption of the media, my mind was always clouded.
[time=1915] Finally, Jesus had mercy on me.
[time=1917] It led me to the point where I was just so tired and so done with my life that I gave it to Him.
[time=1921] I told him I couldn't do it by myself anymore.
[time=1924] I think the angels in heaven started rejoicing at that point.
[time=1927] They were probably thinking, "Oh, finally." I'll be honest.
[time=1931] I used to think religious people were exaggerating when they said a relationship with Jesus was and is the most fulfilling relationship they've ever had in their lives.
[time=1938] Surely they were told to say that, I think.
[time=1941] Now I know, for a fact, they were not exaggerating.
[time=1944] If anything, they didn't express it well enough.
[time=1947] I know I surely won't be able to.
[time=1949] A relationship with Jesus is hard.
[time=1952] It is.
[time=1953] At the beginning, I used to hand Him my heart saying, "Okay, remember, be gentle.
[time=1957] Don't ask too much of it.
[time=1958] Handle it with great care, please." Now I practically beg Him to take it from me.
[time=1963] I know now that it's safer in His hands than a mind any day.
[time=1966] He has helped me overcome so many difficult obstacles, some of them being hatred, insecurity, procrastination, worry, fear,
[time=1974] a lack of trust in Him and much much more.
[time=1976] My Lord has my heart forever.
[time=1978] I see Him work in my life every day.
[time=1980] I promise I'm not exaggerating.
[time=1982] In this peace you guys keep talking about, I feel it.
[time=1986] I am filled with a constant supernatural peace that can only be from Him.
[time=1990] Joy, peace, and love fill my days because of Him.
[time=1993] I treasure His wisdom, His love, His daily guidance.
[time=1997] I even treasure the hardship He gives me.
[time=2000] Because I know now He's teaching me His wisdom and peace.
[time=2003] I love Him.
[time=2004] I love our Jesus.
[time=2006] Glory to our God forever.
[time=2007] [AMEN] I'm going to say a few things about it.
[time=2015] Just don't want to hurt their older nose.
[time=2025] I remember Casey in middle school, and she looks totally different now.
[time=2030] Not physically, what I'm talking about, but spiritually.
[time=2034] She really got us already changed so much about spiritually who Casey is.
[time=2039] And it just warms my heart.
[time=2041] We all can relate to the story that Casey just read.
[time=2045] That a lot of times we say, "Jesus, yeah, you can be part of my life, but you can't have it all." And so I think that's a reminder for all of us today with her testimony.
[time=2054] You ready Casey?
[time=2056] Yeah.
[time=2057] Now in front of your church family and your family, it's now my honor and privilege to baptize
[time=2063] the name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=2070] [APPLAUSE - 7 seconds]
[time=2084] So welcome Malik.
[time=2086] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2087] Talk very loud in the mic here.
[time=2092] Let me share his story, okay, guys?
[time=2095] My mom told me about Jesus that he died across from our sins.
[time=2099] So I heard about Jesus because I want to live with God.
[time=2105] So I want to live with my life with God.
[time=2108] So if I do anything wrong, ever forgive this.
[time=2112] Aw, amen to that, guys.
[time=2114] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2121] And there's something else written on here, I think, probably from his mom or family member.
[time=2127] He says, "Great job.
[time=2129] I am so glad that you want to trust in Jesus." And Malik, I want you to look out into the church, Malik.
[time=2136] And I want you to remember this time because this is going to really stand, just going to be a huge time in your life that you can look back to.
[time=2144] And Malik and I, we had some really good conversations in our baptism class.
[time=2149] And he truly does understand that he's a sinner and that Jesus came for him so that he could
[time=2156] be forgiven of his sins.
[time=2158] And Malik is here today.
[time=2160] He's very serious about baptism.
[time=2162] He wants to live for the Lord.
[time=2164] And it's just, again, warming in my heart.
[time=2166] Fifth grader who wants to make that commitment and does not want to go the way of the world.
[time=2172] So Malik, you ready?
[time=2174] All right, buddy.
[time=2176] Hold on to me.
[time=2177] Want to plug your nose?
[time=2180] Okay.
[time=2181] Malik, with all your church family here and your family looking on, it's now my privilege
[time=2191] and honor to baptize you.
[time=2192] And you've got the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=2208] I have here with me Dan Herman and his, he's the husband of April Herman and their two
[time=2214] kids, Cooper and Emi.
[time=2216] And he's going to just share a story with you.
[time=2218] I'm excited for you to hear it.
[time=2220] He's a good man and he loves the Lord.
[time=2222] So there you go.
[time=2223] Thanks.
[time=2225] Hi.
[time=2226] My name is Dan Herman.
[time=2228] I'm 36 years old.
[time=2229] I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio to parents Jean and Kay Herman.
[time=2233] And I'm the youngest of four siblings.
[time=2235] After living in Cincinnati, all my life, I moved to Fort Wayne in 2007.
[time=2240] You know, those Marisis can be pretty convincing.
[time=2245] That year I graduated from the University of Cincinnati with a degree in electrical engineering and started employment with local defense contractor Excelis where I still work to this day.
[time=2255] I've been married for 12 years to my beautiful hardworking wife April and I have two amazing children, Cooper, who is turning six this week, actually.
[time=2264] And Emi, who is three.
[time=2266] In my free time, I enjoy sports, fishing and spending time with my family.
[time=2271] I was blessed to grow up in a Christian household with devout Christian parents who showed me all about God's love for me.
[time=2278] When I was eight years old, I attended a Christian movie about whitewater rafting.
[time=2282] At the end of that movie, they gave an altar call and I decided right there to ask Christ for forgiveness and ask him into my heart.
[time=2290] Through my teen years, I had my share of ups and downs, but I never lost faith in the fact that Jesus loves me and wants the best for me.
[time=2298] After high school, I truly recognized that fact and therefore recommitted my life to serving him and furthering his kingdom.
[time=2306] I don't take lightly our freedom to worship in this country, given the persecution, excuse me, happening all around the world.
[time=2313] And I do my best to spread the gospel to the lost in the hurting.
[time=2318] I am a sinner, but by God's blood I have been saved.
[time=2321] I want to be baptized today to share with you my good news and that my faith in God is stronger than ever.
[time=2327] I ask that you pray for me so that I may be a stronger husband, father and witness to those around me.
[time=2334] I believe this hem sums it up best for me.
[time=2338] All to Jesus I surrender, all to Him I freely give.
[time=2342] I will ever love and trust Him in His presence daily to live.
[time=2348] I surrender all, I surrender all, all to be my blessed Savior I surrender all.
[time=2359] Damn, do you believe that Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior?
[time=2366] Yes, sir.
[time=2367] Do you want to live for Him the rest of your life?
[time=2368] Absolutely.
[time=2369] It is an honor to baptize you and name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=2382] Morning, my name is Laurel Flegi and just like Mr. Raybur said, I cannot help but be
[time=2395] up here.
[time=2396] And Jesse just said, who wants to be baptized and the Lord is like, you do Laurel?
[time=2401] Oh, do I God.
[time=2403] Are you sure?
[time=2404] I rested with myself for about five minutes and I felt like I was going to throw up because God is like Laurel, time for you to go, time for you to go, I'm like Lord, can I schedule an appointment doing a couple of months?
[time=2416] No.
[time=2417] Here I am.
[time=2419] But I am here.
[time=2426] I am here because of what Christ did in me.
[time=2430] And I am from a solid Christian home, but that wasn't enough.
[time=2435] When I was five, I purchased fire insurance, I said the prayer and I didn't want to go
[time=2441] to hell because I knew what it was, but also I didn't really get what a personal relationship
[time=2447] with God was.
[time=2448] So when I was 10, I went to camp and I really got it.
[time=2451] It clicked.
[time=2452] So since I'm from being 10 to now, I've just been loving the Lord.
[time=2457] He's specifically been showing me about his forgiveness and his redemption.
[time=2461] I've just been learning all sorts of things about him.
[time=2464] He's my best friend and I can't live without him.
[time=2467] He is everything to me.
[time=2469] And his forgiveness is something I can't describe.
[time=2473] His facefulness is something that is beyond words.
[time=2476] And as a 16 year old, standing here, it's ridiculous how much joy I feel and I was not
[time=2483] planning on doing this this morning, but also Kelly told us a couple months ago that the
[time=2489] reason for baptism is that giving glory to God in front of your fellow believers.
[time=2494] And that's what I'm doing.
[time=2495] I'm here.
[time=2496] And if that's why God wanted me to be spontaneous, that's why I'm here.
[time=2500] But he is everything.
[time=2502] And if you don't know him personally and you don't know what a piece he has and what joy comes into your life, when you're filled with him, what his son did, his son was murdered
[time=2513] for me, for my sin, when I was a brat, when I was seven years old, for when I smartmouthed
[time=2519] my parents or when I disobeyed his calling, he died for me.
[time=2524] The nails went through his wrists for me.
[time=2526] And that is, there aren't words for that, and there aren't words for my joy.
[time=2533] And I'm just really excited to be up here.
[time=2535] And I didn't think Jesse would actually say, "Okay, Laurel, let's go up and I'll meet you up there." But he did.
[time=2540] So I just, I'm just so excited to see what God's going to do through this and through me.
[time=2546] And my kiddos, I teach Sunday school, I teach the Lions class, I've taught in fourth and fifth grade, and they're all in here right now.
[time=2553] I teach all my kiddos.
[time=2555] And if I, I want to be an example to them, because if I cannot obey God and come instantly
[time=2562] in five minutes and get baptized, then how much more when I'm telling them about how they can be brave in school and how God is with them, they, there's no foundation for what I teach them, if I'm not willing to follow it myself.
[time=2574] So I want to, I just want to glorify God by being baptized today.
[time=2579] I want to, I want you all to know that I love the Lord, I'm thankful for what He did.
[time=2584] I believe in His salvation and that I want to proclaim that I'm a follower of Christ and I plan to be for the rest of my life.
[time=2594] All right, I don't, I think we're good, I don't think we need a class or any, the way
[time=2614] we need.
[time=2615] We need a time of practice.
[time=2617] Do you believe that Jesus Christ you're learning to say to you?
[time=2620] Yeah.
[time=2621] Do you want to follow Him all of your days?
[time=2622] Absolutely.
[time=2623] I'd rather than honor to baptize you than the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=2633] All right, amen, let's sing the last part of this song together in light of that.
[time=2643] Sing, I rise as your risen, I rise as you are risen, declare your rule and reign, my life
[time=2654] confess your fortune and glorify your name, your word, it stands eternal, your kingdom
[time=2664] knows no end, your praise goes on forever, and on and on again.
[time=2672] No power can stand against you, no curse is all you've thrown, no one can steal you's
[time=2681] glory.
[time=2682] Oh, it is yours alone, I send you to sing your praises, I send you to testify, for I was
[time=2691] dead in my sin, and now I rise, I will rise as Christ who's raised to life, and now in
[time=2708] Him, I live, I rise, and I will rise as Christ who's raised to life, and now in Him, now
[time=2733] in Him, I live.
[time=2747] What a powerful picture of what baptism, what a life in Jesus Christ is all about, so thankful
[time=2756] for those kids, wow, wow, so good, that's what Jesus offers every one of us in this
[time=2765] room, transformed life, real life that fills and matters and gives you purpose and meaning,
[time=2774] that's what Jesus came to do, the water is ready, is there anybody else in this room that needs to be baptized today, I'll jump in already, let's do it, because that's what
[time=2785] Jesus came to be about, transformed life by His amazing grace, so good, I'm so thankful
[time=2793] for what we just got to experience, so good, and as we continue, we're going to do communion
[time=2800] now, that makes sense, so good to remember what God did on that cross by partaking your
[time=2807] community together, the Lord's Supper is to be observed as a constant reminder of Christ's
[time=2813] death and forgiveness, let me just read something as we just think about the invitation to the
[time=2822] table today, so that we may discern the Lord's body and understand what the Lord's Supper
[time=2828] is and why we share it, let us recall these things, God created humanity in His own image
[time=2834] to know and love and serve His Maker, mankind fell into sin and condemnation, we are sinners but our Heavenly Father because of His love, His grace, mercy, pity, kindness and compassion
[time=2845] has provided the Atonement that our sins made necessary, by His death on the cross our Lord
[time=2852] Jesus took our place and endured the judgment due to us, He now invites us to renew the covenant of faith by which our sins are pardoned and to receive power by His Holy Spirit to overcome
[time=2863] them, see here His broken body and His blood, the testimonies of His willingness to restore us, in this way He sealed the covenant which pardons all our sins and certifies our reconciliation
[time=2875] with God and our adoption and our right to everlasting blessedness, let us not resist,
[time=2882] but completely give up ourselves to Christ and not doubt that our crimson sin shall be
[time=2888] made as white as snow, let us not object that our sins are too many or too great against His grace, there is none too great for Him to pardon for those who believe, revive now
[time=2900] your love for Jesus Christ and one another and forgive those that have wronged you and delight in the communion of the saints, receive now the crucified Christ He represented and be content to take up your cross and follow Him, let faith and love be working on these
[time=2916] things while you're at this holy table, if you've surrendered your life to Christ and
[time=2922] you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that He is your Lord and Savior this table is open for you, as the song is played we invite you to come forward and take
[time=2932] the elements. "In a tired and the mountains that I face, let me stronger than the power of the grave, it is constant in the trial and the change, it's one thing."
[time=2990] "Yeah, your love never fails, never gives up, never runs out on me, your love never fails, never gives up, never runs out on me, your love never fails, never gives up, never runs out on me, your love never fails, never gives up, never runs out on me."
[time=3020] The Lord's Supper is something to take really seriously.
[time=3045] The Lord's Supper is something that He said, "This body, this blood, this new covenant, so that we may discern the Lord's body and understand what the Lord's Supper is, it's why we share it.
[time=3058] Let us recall these things. God created humanity in His own image to know and to love and serve as a master, mankind fell into sin and condemnation.
[time=3071] We are sinners but our Heavenly Father because of His love, His grace, His pity, His kindness and compassion led us to a spot that an atonement for our sin was necessary, and so we did.
[time=3087] By His death on the cross, our Lord Jesus took our place, endured the judgment that was due every one of you out there in me, and that's what it represents today.
[time=3098] He now invites us to renew the covenant of faith by which our sins are pardoned and your debt has been paid.
[time=3107] Sins are pardoned and debt is paid. That's real.
[time=3112] Your account balances that zero because of the blood of Christ.
[time=3123] He now invites us to renew the covenant by faith by which our sins are pardoned and to receive the power by His Holy Spirit to overcome them.
[time=3134] See here is broken body in His blood, the testimonies of His willingness to restore us.
[time=3140] In this way He sealed that covenant. The New Testament tells us that.
[time=3147] Which pardons all of our sins and certifies our reconciliation, a guarantee, a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance, that's what it says.
[time=3159] Which pardons all of our sins and certifies our reconciliation with God and our adoption and our right to everlasting blessedness.
[time=3167] Let us not resist but completely give up ourselves to Christ and then not doubt that our crimson sins, crimson sins shall be made as white as snow.
[time=3178] Let us not object that our sins are too many or too great against His grace.
[time=3184] There is none too great for Him, none too great for Him to pardon for those who believe.
[time=3192] Revive now your love of Jesus Christ of one another, forgive those that have wronged you and delight in the communion of the saints.
[time=3199] Receive the crucified Christ to your represented and be content to take up your cross.
[time=3204] That's what He says.
[time=3207] 1 Corinthians chapter 11 I believe it is.
[time=3211] For I have received from the Lord that which I also passed on to you. The Lord Jesus on the night He was betrayed took bread.
[time=3220] He took bread like that and He broke it.
[time=3226] And when He had given thanks He broke it and said this is my body, this is my body which is for you.
[time=3234] Do this in the remembrance of me so take the body.
[time=3242] In the same way after He took the cup saying this is the cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[time=3249] It's the new covenant in my blood for whenever you drink it be reminded that the blood was shed for you.
[time=3258] You, your name, Barbie Campbell, Cara Smith, Danny Howard, for you personally it was shed.
[time=3272] For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes.
[time=3278] Thereforever who eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.
[time=3287] A man ought to examine himself before he eats for anyone who eats without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment to himself.
[time=3296] So take the cup and be reminded that it was for you as an individual.
[time=3303] We're going to sing together to get to higher than the mountains I face.
[time=3333] And it's higher than the mountains that I face.
[time=3339] It's stronger than the power of the great.
[time=3345] And it's constant in the trial and the change is one thing.
[time=3354] It remains. Love never fails. Yeah, your love never fails. Never gives up. Never runs out on me.
[time=3364] Your love never fails. Never gives up. Never runs out on me. Your love never fails. Never gives up. Never runs out on me.
[time=3377] Your love never fails. Never runs. Never runs out on me.
[time=3385] I'm going to sing on and on it goes.
[time=3395] Going on and on and on and on it goes.
[time=3402] Yes, it overwhelms and satisfies my soul.
[time=3408] And I'll never ever have to be afraid if there's one thing remains on and on.
[time=3420] Going on and on and on and on it goes.
[time=3426] Yes, it overwhelms and satisfies my soul.
[time=3432] And I'll never ever have to be afraid if there's one thing remains.
[time=3445] Your love never fails. Never gives up. Never runs out on me. No, your love never fails. Never gives up. Never runs out on me.
[time=3472] You sing in death and life. In death, in life, I'm confident and covered by the power of Your Great Love.
[time=3488] My death is paid. There's nothing that can separate my heart from Your Great Love.
[time=3500] No, your love never fails. Never gives up. Never runs out on me. No, your love never fails. Never gives up. Never runs out on me. No, your love never fails. Never gives up. Never runs out on me. No, your love never fails. Never gives up. Never runs out on me.
[time=3530] Never runs out on me. No, your love never fails. Never runs out on me. No, your love never fails. Never runs out on me. No, your love never fails.
[time=3560] Never runs out on me. No, your love never fails. Never runs out on me. No, your love never fails.
