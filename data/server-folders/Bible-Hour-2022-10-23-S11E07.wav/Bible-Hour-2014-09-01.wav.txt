[time=30] It's all about you, Jesus, King of endless world.
[time=41] No one could express how much you deserve.
[time=48] [MUSIC]
[time=51] The one we can call, all I have is yours.
[time=57] Every single breath, I'll bring you more than a song.
[time=67] For a song in this film is not what you have required.
[time=75] You search much deeper within, through the way things appear.
[time=82] You're looking into my heart.
[time=88] I'm coming back to the heart of worship, and it's all about you.
[time=97] It's all about you, Jesus.
[time=101] I'm sorry, Lord, for the King I'm naked, when it's all about you.
[time=110] It's all about you, Jesus.
[time=114] I'm coming back to the heart of worship, and it's all about you.
[time=123] It's all about you, Jesus.
[time=126] I'm sorry, Lord, for the King I'm naked, when it's all about you.
[time=135] It's all about you, Jesus.
[time=141] [MUSIC]
[time=148] Oh, here I stand.
[time=150] Oh, here I stand, arms open wide.
[time=185] Oh, I am yours, and you are mine, Jesus.
[time=203] [MUSIC]
[time=215] Take my life, and I lay it down, at the cross, where I am on.
[time=227] All I have, give to you my God.
[time=236] Take my hands, take my hands, and make them bleed.
[time=245] Keep my heart in purity, that I may walk in.
[time=254] Oh, you have for me, oh, here I stand, arms open wide.
[time=271] Oh, I am yours, and you are mine, Jesus.
[time=289] Take my moments, take my moments, and my days, let each breath, and that I'd say,
[time=310] leave me ever on me, for you, oh, God.
[time=324] Oh, here I stand, arms open wide.
[time=332] Oh, I am yours, and you are mine.
[time=343] Oh, here I stand, arms open wide.
[time=355] Oh, I am yours, and you are mine.
[time=367] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, my whole life, and I whole life is yours.
[time=394] I'll give it all, surrender to your name, and forever I will pray, have your way, have
[time=410] your way, my whole life is yours, I'll give it all, surrender to your name.
[time=423] And forever I will pray, have your way, have your way, have your way, have your way, have
[time=444] your way, have your way, have your way, have your way, have your way, have your way,
[time=812] with great hope, expect the work of your spirit in our midst.
[time=817] And so God, it's not about me, it's not about even us in this room, it's about you and about your glory, about your truth.
[time=827] We're so grateful that you've allowed your truth and your glory to be good for us.
[time=832] And so I pray that you would open our eyes and open our ears so that we may behold wonderful truths from your law.
[time=842] God help us to understand a little bit more clearly today about what's your purpose in having first Timothy penned.
[time=854] A little bit more clear on what those verses in chapter one are gonna mean to us and for us.
[time=864] And so we come to you for help this morning.
[time=867] Christ's name that we pray, amen.
[time=870] Well, a quick overview of first Timothy, we're gonna look at its setting and its theme quickly.
[time=875] So as we think about it setting, first of all, imagine if you would, just a charismatic individual starts a business, well liked, maybe tall, maybe handsome,
[time=888] I don't know whatever you wanna put in there, but starts a business and it does really well.
[time=894] Of that business, he just continues to develop and create a culture that is excellent, a culture that is high integrity, culture with a great work ethic, a culture that just embodies his corporation.
[time=910] All along as he's developing this corporation,
[time=916] he's bringing along a young person as a disciple of his, let's say, for those of you like Star Wars, a young Padawan learner.
[time=926] But he's along with the sidekick and he's going about and he spends his efforts and his times in creating this culture that is this business that has just done really well.
[time=937] In fact, it is done better than any expectation that he might have and yet at the two year mark, he turns to his young student and he says, I'm out of here, I want you to take the helm, I want you to do everything that you can to keep this culture intact, to keep this business growing, to keep its endeavor moving forward.
[time=961] I want you to stay, I want you to take over because I have to go and do something else.
[time=969] Can you imagine what that young person might feel like in the midst of this corporation that is just excelling and growing and thriving and there were probably other people that would want to influence the direction of that place, there would be other people who would want to take the leadership reins and perhaps that young student might feel a little bit timid, might be a little bit fearful, might have a little bit of a reservation there to continue on what his former person had talked him through and walked him through.
[time=1006] And that's exactly as we look at first Timothy, what's going on.
[time=1011] Instead of a business though, it's the church.
[time=1014] Paul had spent some time in Ephesus and we're going to look at Acts chapter 19 in a second to get a background, but Paul had spent several years in Ephesus and what the Bible describes as an amazing ministry.
[time=1027] And he does that for several years and as he's doing that, he has his young child in the faith, Timothy, who he's bringing up, who he's discipling.
[time=1041] And his goal there is for that Timothy then to take over because in two years or at the two-year mark, he departs and God's called him to a new endeavor.
[time=1052] And yet he started this thriving ministry, this thriving church in Ephesus.
[time=1058] And he basically says, Timothy, I'm out of here.
[time=1062] I want you to take the helm.
[time=1066] I want you to make sure that you protect this culture that's been created by the work of the Spirit and the power of Christ.
[time=1074] Can you imagine how Timothy might have felt?
[time=1077] Again, other voices that would have wanted to take those leadership reigns, other influences that would want to sneak in and take part in where that church was headed.
[time=1090] And here's this young person in the faith we know from 1 Timothy 4.
[time=1095] Paul says, don't let anyone look down on your usefulness.
[time=1099] He also was potentially in 2 Timothy chapter one, we can understand that he might have also had some feelings of timidity, a little bit of reservation about what Paul was calling to him to.
[time=1112] And yet we see at the very first verses of 1 Timothy, this urging from Paul to Timothy to stay, remain on at Ephesus.
[time=1123] I can imagine the relationship that Paul and Timothy had, that there would have been some correspondence between them.
[time=1130] And Timothy would have had the opportunity to write and say, Paul, I don't know.
[time=1135] Certainly there would have been some expectation and excitement about what God might do in the future, but at the same time there could have been some sort of timidity to say, Paul, I don't know if I can do this.
[time=1145] And Paul writes back and says, Timothy, remain on at Ephesus.
[time=1151] Stay the course, he says it a different way, he says, fight the good fight later on in his letter to Timothy.
[time=1161] And so that's the setting that we find this book in.
[time=1167] And then we go to the theme which can be found in chapter three, I believe, of 1 Timothy.
[time=1174] Chapter three, verse 14.
[time=1179] Paul says to Timothy, Timothy, I hope to come to you soon, but I'm writing these things to you so that if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of truth.
[time=1201] Great indeed, we confesses the mystery of godliness.
[time=1204] He, Jesus, was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world and taken up in glory.
[time=1217] I could believe that's the theme of this book.
[time=1222] As you look at two words in there, in verse 15, this idea of behave.
[time=1227] There was an emphasis on behavior, on how one was to act inside the church.
[time=1233] But secondly, there was this second word, this truth.
[time=1237] As the church is described here as the pillar and buttress of truth.
[time=1243] So I think these verses have two main components, which can be seen clearly throughout the book, and emphasis upon behavior and doctrine.
[time=1253] So I believe we conclude here that Paul has two main charges to Timothy.
[time=1261] Two main charges that come from Paul, to his young son in the faith, Timothy.
[time=1269] And those charges are this, number one, Timothy, protect the doctrine that was entrusted to you.
[time=1276] And two, continue to instruct the people in godliness.
[time=1281] We'll do a quick fly-by to look at these and to help us understand that these are part of that essential message that Paul has for Timothy.
[time=1290] But let's first look at that, protecting the doctrine.
[time=1293] He comes right away in chapter one, verse three.
[time=1296] When he says to Timothy, as I urge you when I was going to Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus.
[time=1303] Here's the purpose.
[time=1304] So that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine.
[time=1310] You see the emphasis there on protecting sound doctrine?
[time=1314] We go on in verse 11 of chapter one, and you can just follow in your Bible with me.
[time=1319] It says this, that there is sound doctrine that's in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed god with which I have been entrusted.
[time=1326] Now that's Paul speaking, but go seven verses later in verse 18.
[time=1330] He says this charge, I entrust to you, Timothy.
[time=1335] He's passing on this deposit, this amazing doctoral message about the truth of who God is and what he's accomplished through and in his son, Jesus Christ.
[time=1346] And he's saying this is the message, the doctrine, the truth that's been entrusted to you.
[time=1353] In verse five of chapter two, it says this.
[time=1357] "For there is one God, and there's one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time.
[time=1367] For this I was appointed, a preacher and an apostle." In chapter three, we read it earlier, it's our theme verse.
[time=1375] But in verses 15 and 16, again, it's, the church is described as the pillar and buttress of truth.
[time=1383] And then in chapter six, verse 13, as you flip back to the end of this letter, it says this, "I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things and of Christ Jesus." Verse 14, "To keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ." And then down in verse 20, oh, Timothy is final words, guard the deposit entrusted to you.
[time=1417] Do you see this emphasis all throughout Timothy about just this beautiful doctrine that has been entrusted to Paul that now is entrusted to Timothy and Paul's desire for Timothy to guard and protect that sound doctrine.
[time=1434] But not only that, there's a charge that you can see throughout it that would be Timothy's instruction in godliness, that this doctrine would actually flow out of a heart that is full of what God has done into a behavior that reflects the truth of what God has done.
[time=1454] So there's this idea of instructing the people in godliness in verse four of chapter one again.
[time=1460] He says, "Teach them to not devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies which promote speculation." It's talking to him to tell them not to do behavior that's not in line with proper godliness.
[time=1475] Verse five, he says it this way, "The aim of our charge is love from a pure heart, a good conscience and a sincere faith.
[time=1485] He's getting at this idea of their behavior." In chapter two, verses one, again, there's this urging that Paul has that to Timothy, I urge that supplications and prayers and intercessions and thanksgiving be made for all people.
[time=1502] And verse eight, again, he just says, "I desire that in every place men should pray." So there's these urgings, there's these compelling messages that Paul is communicating to Timothy to say, "Make sure that people do this.
[time=1517] Make sure their behavior is in line with the truth that we're guarding." Verses 14 and 15 of chapter three again.
[time=1528] He says, "I'm writing you that one ought to or to know how one ought to behave in the household of God." Again, the emphasis upon behavior.
[time=1537] Chapter four, verse six, he says to Timothy, "If you put these things before the brethren, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus." Chapter four, verse 12, he tells Timothy to set an example for the believers.
[time=1555] He says to set that example in verse 12,
[time=1561] when he says to set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity, in their behavior, in their lifestyle.
[time=1573] Chapter five, verse seven, he says command and teach these things.
[time=1577] Chapter six, verse three, teach in a way that is in accordance with godliness.
[time=1582] Verse 17, he says, "As for the rich, charge them not to be haughty, but to set their hopes on God." There's this instruction, this kind of dual purpose that says Timothy is to guard the doctrine and continue to instruct the people in godliness.
[time=1605] And so as we continue to move through the book of first Timothy in the preceding weeks, maybe a couple months as we stay in there, understand that this is the foundation.
[time=1617] This is the setting that Paul has left, that Timothy is here to guard and to guide the people there.
[time=1625] But even more than these two charges, as I read the pages of Paul's first letter to Timothy, what jumps out on the page for me and what I see specifically in verses one through 11, but it flows throughout the whole letter is this, a desire for Timothy, for Paul to see Timothy protect a culture, to protect a way of doing things,
[time=1658] specifically to protect a gospel culture, which he first started when the church at Ephesus began.
[time=1670] And so as we move into verses one through 11, I see this idea of Paul's desire for Timothy is to protect a gospel culture.
[time=1682] It's doctrine and it's practice.
[time=1686] It's truth and it's behavior.
[time=1689] See, culture again is just simple this.
[time=1691] It's the ideas or customs or skills and arts of a given people in a given period.
[time=1696] And every organization has a culture, doesn't it?
[time=1700] Whether they communicate it or not, or you can clearly see it if you spend time in that organization, in that group of people, because that culture is going to show itself in the way that they relate to one another, in the things that they hold dear, in the conversations that they have, and the subject matter of their conversations.
[time=1722] Every organization has a culture, your home has a culture.
[time=1728] Your marriage has a culture.
[time=1734] The way that you've chosen to interact with one another as husband and spouse.
[time=1740] The truth that you're holding onto, which forms the foundation of your marriage.
[time=1747] The subject matter of your conversations, the things you watch, the places, it's a culture that's created by what you've done and how you behave.
[time=1759] So even your marriage has a culture and every church has a culture.
[time=1771] Every church has a way of doing things, right?
[time=1775] Things that they hold dear, subject matters of their conversation, ways that they relate to one another.
[time=1784] And what Paul is saying here to Timothy is to make sure that the culture in the church at Ephesus is a culture that is found upon and embedded in the gospel of Jesus Christ, because that truth, the person and work of Jesus, is going to impact how they relate to one another.
[time=1804] It's going to impact the subject matter of their conversations.
[time=1808] It's going to have a huge impact upon the things that they hold dear and the way that they interact with one another.
[time=1818] So what is a gospel culture?
[time=1823] Oh, I believe that the opening versus the first Timothy give us four characteristics of a gospel culture.
[time=1831] We'll look at each of them individually, but they're in line here.
[time=1837] Number one, a gospel culture has at its center the wonderful doctrines of Christ.
[time=1845] Two, a gospel culture embraces grace-motivated behavior.
[time=1854] Three, a gospel culture embraces the gospel for sanctification as well as salvation.
[time=1862] And then four, a gospel culture sees and rejoices
[time=1868] in the bigger picture of God's redemptive purposes and plans throughout eternity.
[time=1873] Now as we move through these four, I just want to let you know, we're going to spend way more time on the first one, spend a little less time on the second and three and four will move very quickly through.
[time=1887] But let's take a look at this first one, but as we do first, let's read first Timothy chapter one verses one through 11.
[time=1894] Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by command of God our savior and of Christ Jesus our hope to Timothy my true child in the faith, grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
[time=1907] As I urge you when I was going to Macedonia, I remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine, nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies which promote speculation rather than the stewardship from God that is by faith.
[time=1923] The aim of our charge is love.
[time=1926] That issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith, certain persons by swerving from these have wandered away into vain discussion, desiring to be teachers of the law without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make confident assertions.
[time=1946] Now we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, understanding this that the law is not laid down for the just, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality and slavers, liars, purgers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.
[time=1978] So number one, first characteristic.
[time=1983] Certainly this list of characteristics of a gospel culture aren't complete, I'm sure there are other descriptions of a gospel culture, but number one, a gospel culture has at its center the wonderful doctrines of Christ.
[time=1995] Notice in our passage the clear distinction to two types of teachers mentioned in our section.
[time=2002] The distinction is seen in verse eight.
[time=2006] And it centers upon the proper and improper use of the law.
[time=2012] Those who use the law lawfully and those who do not,
[time=2018] what it says in verse eight.
[time=2019] Now we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully.
[time=2025] So let's take a look at this and try to understand what does it mean by using the law lawfully?
[time=2032] And what does it mean by using the law unlawfully?
[time=2036] Let's look at the unlawfully first.
[time=2039] Those who do not use it in a proper manner are described throughout these verses.
[time=2046] I think that Paul, or Paul had specific people in mind, some of the other leaders that might be in the church that were delivering a different message, but it says there in verse three and six that they are certain persons.
[time=2059] But we can know about this message, this law that is used unlawfully, several things.
[time=2065] One, verse three, it's a different doctrine.
[time=2068] I mean, that's why Paul left Timothy there for one reason, is to instruct certain persons not to teach a different doctrine.
[time=2076] Verse four though, that doctrine comes because those teachers have devoted themselves to myths and genealogies.
[time=2084] It's going back to their ancestry.
[time=2086] Probably more of a Judaistic type of research
[time=2093] that goes back to what type of family they were from and what that would mean for them.
[time=2099] Verse six though, it says this, they have swerved from things like those mentioned in verse five, a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith.
[time=2112] That just simply means that they've missed the mark.
[time=2115] They've deviated from the true nature of the law.
[time=2120] Instead of it being an inward motivation, for them it's become an outward expression of morality.
[time=2127] In verse seven, we can see that these people that use the law in a wrong way, they want to be teachers of the law.
[time=2137] I mean, that's their goal.
[time=2139] But look at what Paul says, even though they may talk a big game and are full of confidence, they really don't know what they're talking about.
[time=2147] They've been deviating from those things.
[time=2151] They've missed the mark and verse eight and nine gets it very specific.
[time=2156] They believe that the law is for the just person.
[time=2161] In other words, they view the law as a standard of behavior, which in essence qualifies a person to be either accepted before God or to stay in the good graces of God.
[time=2176] It's an improper use of the law.
[time=2180] It's not how the law was designed to be used.
[time=2184] We can look at the context in chapter four.
[time=2187] It tells us this about these teachers.
[time=2189] Verse two, through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared, they are the ones who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving.
[time=2202] See, here's continued evidence that these certain persons are bringing a Judaistic works-based doctrine into the church.
[time=2211] It's the idea that one's right standing before God was either gained or is somehow maintained by his or her own moral efforts, by his or her personal adherence to the law, by their good works or their own righteousness.
[time=2228] It's very similar to what was happening in Galatians.
[time=2231] In Galatians chapter one, verse six, listen to these words.
[time=2234] Paul says to the believers in Galatia, he says, I'm astonished.
[time=2239] It's a word that just means amazed that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and you're turning to a different gospel.
[time=2251] And then he is quick to say in verse seven, not that there is another gospel, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
[time=2262] You see, it's very easy sometimes.
[time=2267] Having once confessed our need for a savior to fall back into a works-based performance-oriented approach, to our relationship with God.
[time=2278] Especially, especially if we're listening to a message from teachers who have this type of different doctrine.
[time=2288] Either way, sometimes it's even well-intentioned teachers
[time=2295] who are simply missing their mark in their attempts to be biblical, but sometimes it's the so-called wisdom of the world that we buy into.
[time=2303] But either way, this type of message has nothing to do with a gospel culture.
[time=2308] It's not what God intended for his children.
[time=2312] Look quickly at verse four of first Timothy chapter one.
[time=2318] It says that Timothy was to make sure that these people don't devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies, which promote speculation rather than the stewardship from God that is by faith.
[time=2332] What he's saying there in contrast to the false teachers is this, that word stewardship simply means house rules.
[time=2340] The rules that are set for God's people.
[time=2347] The way that God's economy works, it's his house rules.
[time=2352] You know, the ranks have some house rules, right?
[time=2354] That's how I want my kids and our family to interact inside of our house.
[time=2359] Well, God has some house rules.
[time=2361] And those house rules are for his people to interact with him and to relate with him based upon faith, not works, not our own efforts, not an earning mentality, but a faith-based approach.
[time=2379] That's a part of God's rules.
[time=2384] Remember backing Galatians one.
[time=2387] He says, "I'm amazed that you are so quickly deserting him "who called you into the grace of Christ." See what happens there is when we don't know Jesus, the only way that we can interact with God is based upon the law, right?
[time=2404] It's based upon trying to earn our efforts in an attempt that we could never get there, but that's the only way that we can relate to God.
[time=2413] And what he's saying in Galatians is, if you're my child, stop interacting with me in that way, I have called you into the grace of Christ.
[time=2422] In other words, I have come up with this on my own, and it's my idea that you would relate to me, not based upon works, but based upon the grace that I've given to you through my son Jesus.
[time=2436] That's his house rules.
[time=2438] That's how he's designed it.
[time=2443] And so Paul is urging Timothy to protect the gospel culture by instructing these certain persons not to teach this different doctrine.
[time=2453] But there's also teachers, the second type of teacher, right?
[time=2459] Which is Timothy, which is Paul, which hopefully by God's grace is me, teachers who use the law lawfully.
[time=2468] They're described in these verses as well.
[time=2471] Look at verse eight and nine.
[time=2473] We know that the law is good.
[time=2474] If one uses it lawfully, understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just.
[time=2481] Teachers use it lawfully by restricting its use to sinners,
[time=2489] not to the just.
[time=2491] For those who are starting to understand or have come into an understand that they are in desperate need of a savior because when they are on the blocks before God, that they are found wanting.
[time=2504] That they could never earn their relationship with God
[time=2510] based upon their own efforts.
[time=2513] It's the same thing that's communicated again in Galatians in chapter three, verse 19.
[time=2518] Listen to what Paul says there to the church in Galatia.
[time=2521] He says, "Why then the law?" It was added because of transgression until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made and it was put in place through angels by an intermediary.
[time=2535] Now an intermediary implies more than one, but God is one.
[time=2538] Verse 21, "Is the law then contrary "to the promises of God?" Certainly not.
[time=2544] For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law.
[time=2550] But the scripture imprisoned everything under sin so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
[time=2559] Now therefore, before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed.
[time=2567] So then the law was our guardian until Christ came in order that we might be justified by faith.
[time=2575] But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.
[time=2580] For in Christ Jesus, you are all sons of God through faith.
[time=2587] You see, a teacher who uses it lawfully does so by restricting its use to sinners.
[time=2592] Using it the law lawfully comes back to the simple idea that it is present, the law is there to show every person his or her great need.
[time=2603] There is no one righteous.
[time=2605] The law has no power in and of itself to save
[time=2611] or by keeping it to merit some type of favor with God.
[time=2617] Secondly, teachers who use it lawfully, they do so by using it accordance with the gospel.
[time=2625] Look at verse nine, understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just, but for the lawless and the disobedient for the ungodly.
[time=2635] So understand what's going on here.
[time=2637] Verse nine, stop at understanding this.
[time=2641] That's nine and 10 is basically an aside that's going back to describe again the 10 commandments.
[time=2650] And what Paul is doing there is he's using those along with what it says at the end, whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, to basically wrap up everybody in the same group to say there's no one who's just.
[time=2665] I mean, you list those things out, right?
[time=2669] And you know, I'm guilty of almost all of them, right?
[time=2677] And so what he does here is he takes that aside, but he says this, in verse eight, now that we know the law is good, if one uses it lawfully and then skip to 11, in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, they use it lawfully by using it in accordance with the gospel.
[time=2696] The law was never intended to bring about a righteousness for individual, but it does point us to the only way for an individual to be made righteous, the gospel, the person in work of Christ, Romans 21, 321, but now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ, for all who believe.
[time=2723] You see, here we find this proper use of the law.
[time=2728] It's just continually pointing us to the wonderful doctrines of Christ, which are essential to a gospel culture.
[time=2736] We don't have time to look at each of them, but all throughout first Timothy, there are beautiful descriptions about the person and work of Christ.
[time=2745] Next week, Jesse gets chapter 12 and on, and there's a beautiful description in verse 14 of the grace of our Lord, which overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
[time=2757] In chapter two, verse five, I said we didn't have time, but these are too good.
[time=2760] For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all.
[time=2769] To chapter three, 16, his description of how he was manifested in the flesh and then taken up in glory.
[time=2776] And then in chapter six, 14 through 16, this beautiful description of his sovereign rule and reign over everything.
[time=2787] A gospel culture has at its center, the wonderful doctrines of Christ.
[time=2795] Secondly, a gospel culture embraces grace-motivated behavior.
[time=2800] We noticed that there were two distinct teachings.
[time=2806] There's also in our passage two distinct types of outcomes from those teachings, speculation and love.
[time=2815] The speculation comes in verse four.
[time=2817] Those teachers that have devoted themselves to myths and endless genealogy, it promotes speculation.
[time=2824] Simply is a word that refers to uncertainty.
[time=2829] It's a word that refers to inquiry or a questioning of one's position.
[time=2834] You see, an approach to God for either gaining or maintaining our right standing before God on our own efforts will never bring a certainty.
[time=2845] It will never produce confidence.
[time=2848] It will only produce speculation and question and wondering, am I doing enough?
[time=2856] What else should I be doing?
[time=2860] Where do I stand with God?
[time=2865] You see, the law does not have the capacity to change a heart.
[time=2871] It lacks the ability to be able to transform someone from the inside out.
[time=2879] Yes, we can change for a while, right?
[time=2882] Our outward behavior can oftentimes depict a good moral individual for a while.
[time=2890] We can fool many people, sometimes we even fool ourselves.
[time=2894] But in the end, this type of approach is laborious and worrisome and it will never give certainty.
[time=2903] It will never give you confidence.
[time=2906] It's why Christ said, "Come to me and I will give you rest." It's tiring trying to work out your salvation
[time=2918] through your own efforts.
[time=2920] So there is an outcome, that's one outcome, right?
[time=2925] It's a self righteous person doing all he or she can to self atone, ultimately for his or her self glorification.
[time=2935] It's an emphasis upon the individual.
[time=2937] But there's a second outcome to the other type of teaching that uses the law properly.
[time=2942] It's love, it's in verse five, it says this, "The aim of our charge or the goal of our instruction is love, the issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith." That word love is the simple word of love that's agape.
[time=2955] It's the love of Christ that was showed toward us.
[time=2960] The emphasis is not on the individual anymore.
[time=2964] It's a love for God, it's a love for our brothers and sisters in Christ.
[time=2967] It's a love for our fellow humans who are far from God.
[time=2971] It's a selfless giving of oneself.
[time=2975] But notice where this love comes from.
[time=2978] It's very clear, right?
[time=2982] This love issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
[time=2990] These are attributes of someone who has embraced the beauty and glory of Christ, the doctrines of Christ.
[time=2999] These realities can only come because of the work of Christ.
[time=3004] And when one embraces the work of Christ, there is a gratitude for all that Christ has done.
[time=3012] There is a joy that is present because of all that Christ is doing.
[time=3016] And there is a confidence that is a reality because of the hope of all that Christ will do.
[time=3021] And those things overflow into a behavior that is not self-serving or self-promoting, but it's a behavior of love that flows out of his love for us to one another.
[time=3035] It's behavior motivated by the grace we have received.
[time=3041] Grace that we did not deserve.
[time=3046] Grace that we could never earn.
[time=3049] It has nothing to do with fear or coercion or earning or performance.
[time=3056] But it's all about God's house rules.
[time=3060] His wonderful gift of faith and grace to us through Christ.
[time=3066] A gospel culture first is centered on the wonderful doctrines of Christ.
[time=3072] Two, it embraces grace motivated behavior and then quickly three and four.
[time=3076] Three, a gospel culture embraces the gospel for sanctification as well as salvation.
[time=3081] Just notice that Paul's instructions to Timothy
[time=3087] is to preach and teach these gospel truths to believers.
[time=3091] It's what it says in 1 Corinthians 15.
[time=3095] He says, "I delivered to you the gospel "in which you received, in which you also currently stand.
[time=3101] "But I continue to deliver that gospel to you." It's what he said to the believers in Rome.
[time=3106] In Romans chapter one, verse 15, he said, "I long to come and preach the gospel to you." How interesting, isn't it?
[time=3116] That sometimes we relegate the gospel to those people who need it, but in all reality, the gospel is something that we all need to embrace every day of our lives.
[time=3130] Fourth, a gospel culture sees and rejoices in the bigger picture of God's redemptive purposes and plans throughout eternity.
[time=3138] Look at verse 11.
[time=3139] He says, "Whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine "in accordance with the gospel of the glory "of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted." So you see those words, sometimes it's easy to just go over it, the glory of the blessed God.
[time=3158] Oh, what's he talking about there?
[time=3160] It just seems fluff, right?
[time=3163] It seems Christianese, but really what it's talking about this is this whole thing is so much bigger than we can even comprehend.
[time=3171] This gospel culture isn't just about me
[time=3177] and my own salvation.
[time=3179] Christ is building his church, and his redeemed are the bride of Christ.
[time=3187] And this endeavor, the church, is the greatest endeavor on the planet.
[time=3192] And ultimately, what it does is yes, it's good for us individually, but even more than that, it brings great glory and honor to our great God.
[time=3203] A gospel culture sees this and rejoices in it.
[time=3210] So as we conclude, what is a gospel culture?
[time=3217] Why was Paul going to such great lengths
[time=3223] to communicate to his true child in the faith, Timothy, to protect this gospel culture, its doctrine and its practice?
[time=3232] A gospel culture has at its center the wonderful doctrines of Christ.
[time=3237] What does that look like?
[time=3238] I believe it looks like preaching that is full of declaratives.
[time=3242] When we open God's word, yes, there are commands and yes, those commands are for our good, but the only way that we will be able to live out those commands, if our hearts are full of the doctrines that are so essential to us.
[time=3257] And so preaching the word of God is a declarative event
[time=3263] to declare the truth of who God is and what he's done and to have those declaratives inform and motivate us for obedience.
[time=3272] A gospel culture has at its center, the wonderful doctrines of Christ, not only is preaching full of declaratives, but the singing, oh, the singing is boisterous and saturated, which is reminders of who Christ is and what he's done.
[time=3290] Relationships are full of the humility of Christ as we invite correction without the fear of judgment because we know that we're all clothed in the righteousness of Christ.
[time=3305] We hold that doctrine dearly and cherish it.
[time=3310] So why would we judge one another?
[time=3312] Gospel culture embraces grace-motivated behavior.
[time=3318] What does that look like?
[time=3319] It looks like people embracing the gospel or embracing behavior out of joy and gratitude.
[time=3327] It looks like the why of our obedience is as equally important as the how.
[time=3333] It's not just about doing the right thing.
[time=3336] It's doing right things because he has done so much for us.
[time=3342] It looks like the power and pattern of our obedience coming from the work of Christ combined with the help of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3350] A gospel culture, third embraces gospel for sanctification.
[time=3355] What does that look like?
[time=3357] It looks like the person work of Christ is just as important to a person who's walked with the Lord for 40 years as it is to one who's yet to come to know him.
[time=3366] In fact, it looks like the gospel, I believe, will be more precious to those who have walked with him for years because as our sinfulness becomes more clearly seen, his grace becomes greater and greater and the gospel becomes even more amazing.
[time=3384] And then finally, a gospel culture sees and rejoices in the bigger picture of God's redemptive purposes and plans throughout eternity.
[time=3390] The gospel is truth that is great for each of us individually in that it alone can redeem sinners.
[time=3396] But even more than that, it is also greater than each of us.
[time=3400] We have the opportunity and we rejoice in this opportunity to participate in the greatest endeavor on the planet.
[time=3411] Christ building his church, God's redemptive purposes that started before the foundation of the world that will move on into eternity.
[time=3420] And you and I get to be a part of that.
[time=3424] So Paul's urging Timothy remain on,
[time=3433] protect this gospel culture.
[time=3439] What an opportunity we have.
[time=3441] I think of this as teachers, how important it is for us to guard this culture as well.
[time=3451] But also, what an opportunity we have, what an opportunity you have to craft this culture in your family, to craft this culture in your parenting,
[time=3466] in your business that you own, in your marriage, where you have the opportunity to make these things central for the glory of God.
[time=3476] What an awesome opportunity, let's pray.
[time=3478] God, thank you so much for your grace.
[time=3481] Thank you so much for your doctrine, for the behavior that flows from it.
[time=3488] God, it's evident from Paul's urging Timothy that it is way too important for us to just let it slide by, to neglect these things.
[time=3499] God, would you help us to just do our part as well,
[time=3505] to come alongside of your endeavor, to make much of your son, to live lives of godliness that are in line with your work in our hearts, Lord, to rehearse the gospel daily
[time=3524] and to rejoice in the opportunity you've given us, to participate in something that's so bigger than ourselves.
[time=3530] God, we love you this morning.
[time=3531] Thank you for first loving us.
[time=3533] We pray this in Christ's name, amen.
[time=3554] (silence) We're gonna have the choir come back up
[time=3569] and Bill Archer is gonna come back up and we're gonna spend a few minutes commissioning one of ours that's heading out to the mission field.
[time=3578] So if you would, just stay with us a few more minutes and we'll have a good finish to our morning.
[time=3584] (silence) We're gonna ask any elders that are here in the room,
[time=3610] please come up also.
[time=3614] (silence) - Oh, good morning, my name is Bill Archer.
[time=3634] I'm one of your elders and I also have the privilege of working with the global ministries team.
[time=3642] We oversee the sending out and the support of our missionaries and it's of our privilege this morning to commission Andrea O'Shan.
[time=3654] Andrea has been called to her position in Nairobi
[time=3660] and she is going to go in what?
[time=3664] - Three days. - Three days?
[time=3666] Three days, very close.
[time=3671] Linda and I, my wife, first met Andrea about two years ago and at that time we could see very clearly that she had been called.
[time=3680] She indicated I have been called to this work and that's great, that's a good work, a good call.
[time=3691] Over the last two years, I personally have watched Andrea
[time=3697] and I have watched the change in her.
[time=3701] She went from I know God has called me and I want to go, she has gone to a position over the last few months of I have to go.
[time=3711] There is a strength and a maturity that has occurred in her over the last months and I'm excited about that.
[time=3725] And I believe that at the same time the Lord has been working in her and maturing her vision.
[time=3734] He is also maturing and bringing about a need for her in Nairobi.
[time=3741] I know there are people there that don't know you yet and you don't know them but you are going to have a huge impact in their life and I am proud of you.
[time=3754] I'm proud to be part of a church that sends people out to do this kind of ministry, it's just exciting.
[time=3760] We're going to do this commissioning by a certificate,
[time=3766] we the family of Black Hawk Ministries of Fort Wayne, Indiana, here by commission Andrea Mushan.
[time=3772] We believe that God has uniquely called and gifted Andrea for this work.
[time=3777] We commend her to the worldwide ministry of spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ and we pray that God will bless her service presented by Black Hawk Ministries this date, September 7th, 2014.
[time=3790] Andrea, it's our privilege to baptize you.
[time=3793] (congregation laughing) That's already been done, right?
[time=3797] (congregation laughing) Through commission you and we do so with great thanks you and as we lay hands on you, we do so to recognize you and to unite with you, it's our privilege.
[time=3811] I'm going to ask, Mark?
[time=3817] - Let's stand together as we pray for Andrea.
[time=3821] Heavenly Father, you are the great and mighty God
[time=3828] and Father, you send us, you command us to go into all the world and preach the gospel.
[time=3835] We just praise you for Andrea and the work that you've done in her heart and thank you for her responsive nature that when you called, she said, yes, I will go, I will be your servant.
[time=3847] Father, I pray you would work that attitude in each of us that it may not be in Nairobi, but it might be with that neighbor next door.
[time=3856] It might be with that co-worker.
[time=3859] It might be with that family member who needs to hear the truth and love of Jesus Christ.
[time=3865] Father, we pray now that your hand of blessing would be upon Andrea.
[time=3869] Use her in a mighty way as our servant.
[time=3872] Father, help us to faithfully uphold her in prayer, to uphold her in financial support and to help assist her in the needs that she might have as she goes to the field.
[time=3884] Use her in a mighty way that many souls would be one for your kingdom and glory for we ask all these things in Jesus' name.
[time=3891] [AMEN]
[time=3898] (audience applauds) - Andrea is part of the choir family
[time=3911] and we wanted to celebrate with her as she goes.
[time=3916] So we have a song of praise and celebration today is called Osifuni Mungu, that's Swahili.
[time=3924] The song is both in English and Swahili.
[time=3928] And that phrase, Osifuni Mungu means O praise me God.
[time=3933] Can you say that with me, Osifuni Mungu?
[time=3936] Say it with me, Osifuni Mungu.
[time=3939] Hey, you're speaking Swahili.
[time=3941] Awesome.
[time=3942] There's another phrase in there that we're gonna sing called Imbeni.
[time=3947] And we kind of shot it out.
[time=3950] Imbeni, that means to sing.
[time=3953] So we're gonna Osifuni Mungu and we're gonna Imbeni.
[time=3957] And by the way, the choir gets a little bit rowdy sometimes when we sing this song.
[time=3961] Is it okay if we get a little rowdy?
[time=3965] It is a song of celebration.
[time=3968] So celebrate with us.
