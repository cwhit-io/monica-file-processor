[time=0] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=60] This is enough for me, for me.
[time=67] [MUSIC]
[time=84] Amen, Amen, First Timothy 1, 12, says this.
[time=99] I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength that he considered me trustworthy,
[time=105] appointing me to his service, even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor Paul,
[time=112] the violent man I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.
[time=118] The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
[time=125] Here's a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance.
[time=129] Christ Jesus came into this world to save sinners, of whom I am the worst.
[time=135] But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ
[time=141] Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life.
[time=148] Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, the honor and glory for ever
[time=156] and ever, Amen.
[time=162] Everyone needs compassion, love that's never failing, and mercy's all on me.
[time=174] Everyone needs forgiveness, the kindness of the Savior, the role of my nation.
[time=189] My God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save forever,
[time=209] Father of salvation, He rose and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave.
[time=229] So take me as you find me, so take me as you find me, all my fears and failures.
[time=245] Feel my life again, I give my life to follow, everything I believe in, now I surrender.
[time=265] I surrender, save your, He can move the mountain, my God is mighty to save, He is mighty to
[time=280] save forever, Father of salvation, He rose and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the
[time=293] grave, to save, shine your light and let the whole world see, sing it on the glory of
[time=308] the risen king, Jesus, shine your light and let the whole world see, sing it on the
[time=320] glory of the risen king.
[time=322] He can move the mountain, my God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save forever,
[time=335] Father of salvation, He rose and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave, shine
[time=345] your light, shine your light and let the whole world see, sing it on the glory of the risen
[time=369] king.
[time=376] Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=381] I'm glad to be seeing you this morning wearing a sweater, we're in mid-September and it's sweater weather, so happy that you're joining us today.
[time=388] We love that you're watching, we love that you are part of our family, and we love to invite you in to what we're doing here on Sunday morning, week by week, as we try to faithfully serve you and serve the Lord by opening His word together, by worshiping Him
[time=402] in song, it's something that we love to be a part of and love that you are a part of that with us.
[time=408] My name is Steve Webster, I'm a teaching pastor here at the church, I've been happy to serve here for a few years now.
[time=414] This morning you're going to see a couple of things I wanted to introduce you to real quick.
[time=418] We're still in our series in 1 Timothy, walking through Timothy's instructions from Paul about how he's leading a church that's really confused about a lot of things.
[time=426] There was a lot of other teaching going on in the world around Timothy that caused confusion for his church, confusion for him personally.
[time=434] Timothy was timid, he was struggling with his call of God to serve in this way and Paul says, "Timothy, don't doubt it, don't doubt what you're going to hear this morning.
[time=443] The power of the one true gospel, my good friend Jesse Hanna, our operations pastor, will be sharing with you this morning from 1 Timothy chapter 1 about that very thing that the gospel
[time=453] has power.
[time=454] The word of God is living and it's active, it's sharp and the gospel's truth, it's resonance,
[time=462] it's power cannot be overstated.
[time=465] And so I can't wait for you to hear what he has to say, what a beautiful, powerful, timely message for us.
[time=472] I also want to introduce you to someone named Darren McCown, very good friend of ours here at the school.
[time=476] He's been serving here for many, many years and Darren has actually volunteered to serve us in this place for a season of time as our interim music director.
[time=483] Darren's been working with the choir and the band here at the school for again many years and has volunteered to step in and help during our season of transition as our interim music director.
[time=494] So you'll see him leading the choir and leading worship for us on Sunday morning for the foreseeable future.
[time=499] So Darren and his family have come to be a part of our church family and they are going to all volunteer to serve you and serve us in that way.
[time=506] So be looking for Darren, he's got an unmistakable energy, you're going to hear the word huge a lot from Darren.
[time=511] He's very passionate, very excited and we love him.
[time=514] We love his energy.
[time=515] We love his authenticity and I think he will too.
[time=518] Thank you for being with us this morning as we continue our journey through first Timothy, Paul's instructions to a young pastor struggling at a time of uncertainty.
[time=526] So I hope that you'll be encouraged by what you hear this morning as you with us resonate with the power of the one true gospel.
[time=533] Thanks.
[time=540] Have you ever taken the time to look at other people's shoes?
[time=541] Our shoes say a lot about who we are and what we do.
[time=544] They can be fashionable, cozy, protective and definitely well used.
[time=552] We try really hard to put our best foot forward so to speak.
[time=558] When you get a new pair of shoes you revel in that new shoe smell, the clean leather,
[time=564] the paper stuffed in the toe, the wrapper stuffed in the box and they are perfect until
[time=570] you put them on.
[time=571] At church we see lots of different shoes on all kinds of people but they are shoes that will never grease the doors of a church because they're too dirty.
[time=580] They think they have to knock the dirt off or shine up before they come out.
[time=586] Not if we just left our shoes at the door but it presents no assumptions, no dirt, no
[time=593] holes, no identity, no need to clean up because, well, we can't.
[time=601] Our shoes can never be clean enough ever and as hard as we try our efforts fall short
[time=607] of the expectation of perfection.
[time=610] You see, Jesus spent his life getting his feet dirty while walking the dusty roads.
[time=617] In an act of humility he served his disciples by washing their filthy feet.
[time=624] Dirt and grime gone washed clean in his presence by him.
[time=631] That's what being a Christ follower is about.
[time=633] It's about coming so that Jesus can wash our feet.
[time=639] Our shoes just give in the way, we don't need clean shoes, we need bare feet.
[time=649] Not afraid to just to show up accepted because we are fearfully and wonderfully made in his
[time=658] image, free to believe that we don't have to wipe our shoes at the door.
[time=686] Morning, it works better.
[time=688] Our drama team put that together, what a great video, thanks for doing that, that was wonderful.
[time=695] And it's true, you don't have to come here and have it all put together or cleaned up before you can come to church.
[time=702] This is where we come, this is where we come to find Jesus and then he'll clean us up.
[time=708] You don't have to come here first, so we're thankful for that.
[time=711] I mean, you can't even go to the gas station without shoes on but you can come to church without shoes on.
[time=715] [AMEN] We just got done a few weeks ago with the summit, global leadership summit, we're kind of part of that as a church and each speaker had this really cool bio, you know, they did like a video bio that had kind of introduced the speakers and who they were and they all were like super duper amazing speaker people, you know, they're probably all really smart
[time=736] and they're really, they do like, they saved half a country and they've shared the testimony with a billion people and they've given water to a million thousand people and all these really cool things.
[time=747] So I thought, I'm going to make myself a bio and just kind of introduce myself to you.
[time=752] My name is Jesse Hannah, I'm on staff here at Blackhawk.
[time=754] Very thankful for that.
[time=755] I graduated from the Ball State University.
[time=759] All right, that's right.
[time=763] Go Cardinals, Chirp Chirp, right?
[time=767] I have one wife whom I love, thankful for that.
[time=769] I have two beautiful daughters, two children and my claim to fame, at least for this morning's
[time=775] purpose is I am the two-time watermelon eating champion at the Grebel Fair, ages eight and
[time=783] nine and I have two plaques and they're awesome.
[time=787] So that's me.
[time=788] That's my little bio.
[time=789] I just wanted you to know that I can eat at me some watermelon and fast.
[time=796] So last week Josh kicked us off our series, Live It Out and First Timothy.
[time=801] We're walking through the book of First Timothy and he did a great job last week kind of explaining the importance of a gospel culture, what that is and he said a gospel culture has Jesus
[time=811] at the center, grace as its motivator, it embraces the process of growing in one's faith
[time=819] and rejoices in knowing that God has a bigger plan.
[time=823] And now today, whenever I get prepared to teach a specific text, I like to kind of capture
[time=831] the story, the bigger story, where we are in the flow of the story and I like to call that the bigger story.
[time=837] Some would call that redemptive history, I just like to call it God's story, God's plan.
[time=841] And so we're in First Timothy and we know that Paul is sort of passing the light saber to his up and coming Jedi.
[time=848] He kind of talked about that last week for those who understand Star Wars, if you don't don't worry about it.
[time=853] Paul is passing the baton, for those of you who don't know Star Wars, to his true son of the faith, Timothy.
[time=858] And he's providing Timothy with the game plan, these instructions of how people should live
[time=864] it out, that's our theme, how we should live it out, how people should conduct themselves in the house of God.
[time=870] And we read this, the theme comes right out of chapter 3, verse 14 and it says this, "Although I hope to come to you soon," Paul wants to go there and be with Timothy, he says, "although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that if I am delayed you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of truth." And that's our theme, how to live it out, how we live out this thing called faith in Christ.
[time=898] Now Paul's writing to Timothy, that's kind of our story today, but there's another story above that layer, there's another layer up and that is that Jesus is alive and he has planted his church, Jesus is alive and his church has been planted, that's the story above this story.
[time=913] See, it's God's plan for this world, when people, when the church, when we live it out,
[time=920] when we live out a life centered in Jesus and trusting in him, completely the church can change the world that's God's plan, not mine, I didn't make this up, this is what God wants, Jesus alive and his church has been planted.
[time=934] So story number one is Paul's writing to Timothy, a young pastor who needs some encouragement, some instruction and the story above that is Jesus is alive and his church has been planted,
[time=944] but the biggest story, the story above that story is that we have a God who is reconciling the world to himself.
[time=952] He is doing some things, he has been doing it since Genesis 1, in fact he's been doing before the creation of time, but since Genesis 1 to Revelation God has been moving and acting and being God all throughout history.
[time=965] He's been acting and doing things and he's been writing this amazing story that we find
[time=971] in the pages of our Bibles.
[time=974] And the living God in Genesis who created all things is the same God who is reconciling everything to himself including man, he says this in the Old Testament and it finds its way into the New Testament through Christ, "I will be your God and you will be my people." That's the biggest story.
[time=990] The God who acted in history all the way through working his plan climbed down out of heaven, entered the world through the Virgin Mary who shall have a son and you shall give him the name Jesus because he will save his people from their sins.
[time=1004] And Jesus grew and he walked on earth, healed and he taught, he was sinless, he was arrested for claiming to be God, the long way to Messiah was beaten and crucified on the cross and through days later he rose, was seen by witnesses and ascended into heaven where he is seated at the right hand of God, Jesus' birth, his life, his death and his resurrection, all
[time=1024] of those is how God is reconciling the world to himself.
[time=1030] That's what God has done.
[time=1031] And our scriptures are that story.
[time=1033] Our scriptures are God telling us that story.
[time=1035] It's not a collection of myths or genealogies that we saw in the first part of chapter one or self-help or how to be happy and wealthy in life.
[time=1044] It's not fortune-cookie-sangs, it's God telling us his story, inviting us into that story through Jesus for his glory, that's the biggest picture of God working to make a people for himself and today that's us, we're the church, we're God's people because of what Christ
[time=1059] did and it's God's plan to take the truth of Jesus Christ to a lost and broken world.
[time=1066] That's what we're here for, we're God's people.
[time=1069] So if you have a Bible, if you have an iPad, an iPhone, a Droid, a Samsung or an Apple
[time=1075] Watch, get it out, open it up or tap it to 1 Timothy 1, 12 to 20.
[time=1081] That's what we're going to be today.
[time=1083] We will not, I'll just tell you this up front, full disclosure, we will probably not get to 18 to 20, but we'll see what God does.
[time=1090] So last week like I said, Josh is kind of walking us through today, Paul turns his attention away from those false teachers and their abuse of the law and he kind of focuses in on his own personal experience with Jesus Christ, his story, his testimony, what God, what the
[time=1106] gospel did in his life and Paul's kind of looking back when he collided with Jesus.
[time=1112] We're going to read that just a second.
[time=1115] And this is a way, Paul's kind of telling Timothy his story as a way to show Timothy that this is the power of the one true gospel.
[time=1123] In my story, Timothy Paul says, you will see the gospel in action, you will never see it in the law.
[time=1129] He wants to show Timothy the transforming power of the one true gospel, not a gospel that hangs on to the law, but a gospel that is centered in nothing but the cross.
[time=1139] And Paul's posture, his approach, his disposition is thankfulness.
[time=1145] He's writing from this just utter thankfulness for what God has done in his life, what Christ did when he first bumped into him on the road.
[time=1152] So we're going to read Acts chapter 9.
[time=1157] And I want to read this because I don't like it.
[time=1162] When I first came to Christ, I'd go to church, and they'd say, you know the story, I don't
[time=1169] know the story.
[time=1170] I didn't even know what the Bible was.
[time=1171] How am I going to know the stories?
[time=1173] And I felt dumb because I didn't know, but I don't want to do that.
[time=1176] We're going to read the story, Acts chapter 9, what happened to Paul because maybe there's something I don't know the story.
[time=1182] And that's great.
[time=1183] I'm glad you're here.
[time=1184] This is where you should be, to hear about the gospel, to hear about the trees.
[time=1186] So verse 9, I'm sorry, chapter 9, starting right at the beginning, it'll should be on the screens, follow along if you would like.
[time=1192] Meanwhile, Saul was still bringing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples.
[time=1196] He went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus.
[time=1200] So if he found any who were belonging to the way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem.
[time=1206] As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
[time=1210] He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?
[time=1215] Saul is also Paul, just in case.
[time=1218] Who are you, Lord Saul asked?
[time=1219] I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting," he replied, "Now get up and go into the city and you'll be told what you must do." And then traveling with Saul stood there, split just.
[time=1227] They didn't know what was going on.
[time=1229] They heard the sound but they didn't see anything, saw it up from the ground.
[time=1232] But when he opened his eyes, he could see nothing.
[time=1235] So they led him by the hand into Damascus.
[time=1239] For three days he was blind and not to eat or drink anything.
[time=1243] In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias, the Lord called him in a vision.
[time=1247] Ananias, yes, the Lord answered, "The Lord told him, 'Go to the house of Judas on straight street and ask for a man from Tarsus, named Saul, for he is praying.' In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight." Lord Ananias answered, "I have heard many reports about this man." So Ananias has kind of heard about Paul, Paul's kind of mean, he's kind of a bad guy, beat people up, persecution of peoples over the way and it's like, "Ah, I've heard of this guy, I'm not, I don't think I want to do that." God, I'm not really sure.
[time=1277] "I've heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem.
[time=1282] And he has come here with authority from the chief priest to rest, all who call in your name, but the Lord said Ananias, 'Go!' This is my chosen instrument to protect my name to the Gentiles, proclaim my name to the Gentiles, and their kings into the people of Israel.
[time=1296] I will show him how much he must suffer for my name." Ananias went to the house and entered, placing his hands on Saul, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here, has sent me.
[time=1308] So you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit." Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes and he could see again.
[time=1317] He got up and was baptized and after taking some food he regrained his strength.
[time=1322] Saul spent several days with his disciples in Damascus.
[time=1325] But once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God, that's the story.
[time=1335] That's Paul before he knew Jesus.
[time=1337] That's what happened when he bumped into Jesus on the road.
[time=1340] That's the power of the one true gospel.
[time=1342] Paul was living and believing and following.
[time=1344] He had these things he was doing.
[time=1346] He was destroying and persecuting the church.
[time=1350] But Christ arrests his life, transforms and then goes from a persecutor to a proclaimer of Jesus as the Son of God.
[time=1357] And that's the story Paul is telling to Timothy.
[time=1360] It's his story.
[time=1361] It's his experience with the gospel because that's what's true.
[time=1364] The law, it can't do that, only the one true gospel can do that.
[time=1369] And I love the end there where it says he began, immediately he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.
[time=1377] And the very truth, he was trying to destroy that he was persecuting.
[time=1381] Okay, we're going to jump back, first Timothy back in beginning 12 again.
[time=1391] Verse 12, let me read it to you.
[time=1395] I think Christ Jesus, our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me faithful, appointed me to his service.
[time=1400] Again, he comes with this thankfulness, he's so thankful, and there's three things.
[time=1404] It gives him strength, this is what he's kind of remembering his story that we just read next nine.
[time=1409] He's remembering what happened, who he was and what he was about.
[time=1412] He's just so thankful that he is who he is today and what he gets to do today.
[time=1417] And he's just, it gives him strength.
[time=1419] And I'm sure Paul had some days when he wanted to give up, when he wanted to quit, when he wanted to throw in the towel, maybe he was tired of being stoned or imprisoned or weary
[time=1428] day after day, Paul was battling for the true gospel and maybe he just got tired.
[time=1433] But he finds great strength in just remembering his story, where it all happened for Paul.
[time=1439] By never forgetting what God did on that road, he just hangs on and that strength,
[time=1445] their strength in remembering, I have two girls and they take some music lessons at what
[time=1451] used to be Calvary Temple, now it's the first assembly.
[time=1454] And I sometimes I go meet him there and almost not every time, but I think a few years back it was one of the first times and I'd point and I'd say right through that window or right in that room, that's where Dad first heard the gospel.
[time=1469] That's where it all happened for your dad.
[time=1471] That's where my life was changed and radically transformed right there in that room.
[time=1475] And I just tell, I like to tell him that because there's just something about that just breathe thankfulness in me, it just makes me think of that.
[time=1483] It makes me bring strength to my soul.
[time=1486] My heart was changed, the trajectory of my life was changed.
[time=1490] And I just know that no matter what I'm facing in life or in ministry or with the world, as hard as it gets when I want to quit and just throw in the towel or just go paint.
[time=1499] I grew up in a, I'm the son of a painter, a hand of brother's job, I'm painting and every summer I was painting, hanging and sanding and doing all those kinds of things and you know what I like about the wall, the wall doesn't complain, the wall doesn't ask for anything, it doesn't criticize me, it doesn't look at me funny, it's not demanding, and
[time=1519] I can watch my progress from one day to the next.
[time=1524] And some days that is very good.
[time=1528] But when I remember what God did in that room, when I first heard the gospel, where I was sitting, what I was doing, it just gives me strength to keep going.
[time=1536] Now remember that, when He rescued me and saved me through grace, and He just revised
[time=1542] my soul gives me strength.
[time=1545] Maybe you might be here today, maybe you got some weariness, maybe you're a little down, maybe just something hanging on you.
[time=1552] Can I encourage you to remember that there's a God and He loves you and He wants to be in your life?
[time=1558] Can I encourage you to remember the times when God was there for you and lifted you up?
[time=1563] Sometimes when we're uncertain about things, we should go back to the things we're certain about, remember those things, and I hope you guys remember your story.
[time=1570] Maybe you can remember the time when you finally said, "Okay, God, okay, it's time.
[time=1576] I'm enough fun and games here, I'm going to give you my life.
[time=1580] Jesus, thank you for dying on the cross for my sins, thank you for making me your son or daughter." Maybe that's where you need to remember.
[time=1589] Maybe you're not there yet, but you're just still figuring out all this God and church stuff and you're not really buying into that, "I can come here and be dirty." Really?
[time=1598] I don't have to fix things first.
[time=1599] You're still thinking, "I just encourage you to keep taking steps, keep searching." So the source of Paul's thankfulness is his story, remember what Christ did in his own life, it gives him strength, and the second thing here is for God considering Him trustworthy.
[time=1614] I think Christ Jesus, our Lord, has given me strength that He considered me trustworthy.
[time=1620] Now the thrust of this passage here that we're looking at is that Paul's salvation to ultimately everyone's salvation is not earned, but the result of grace and mercy.
[time=1630] Paul was simply amazed that God would consider Him worthy of God's divine call and God's trust.
[time=1635] It's not so much out of a hive, I'm worthy, but I can't believe He would do this in my
[time=1641] life.
[time=1643] I'm so not worthy, it's just, "Are you kidding me?
[time=1647] You kidding me?
[time=1648] God's going to do that.
[time=1649] In my life, this is what God is doing.
[time=1654] It doesn't make sense, but I can't believe that He can somehow, because He chose me, that I'm worthy of that, just because God called not anything in me, but all because of God." Like many of us guys are towards our lives.
[time=1668] She said, "Yes, I can't believe." She said, "Yes, when I asked her to marry me.
[time=1672] Are you kidding me?" I know some of you think that about my wife, you're like, "How did she, why did she say yes to Him?" You, honest, I know you do, it's okay.
[time=1686] People have said it to me, so thank you.
[time=1688] It's true.
[time=1689] I can't believe it either, I sell, so I'm just thankful.
[time=1693] It's the one thing that I can go back to and say, "I know there's a God because my wife said yes." [AMEN] And the third thing that just kind of gives him all this thankful is that not only did he give him strength and he considered him worthy to come and do the things that he called him to do, but he appointed him to his service.
[time=1712] It's rooted in what he once was and all that he had been.
[time=1715] And when someone chooses you to do a task that you know, you just know you're like,
[time=1722] "I should not be doing this." But when someone chooses you and selects you and gives you this purpose and you have
[time=1731] a specific God-honoring task, there's just thankfulness in there.
[time=1736] You're just so thankful, no matter how hard or how messy or how complaining or how whatever
[time=1742] it might be.
[time=1744] You're just thankful that God did what he did in your life.
[time=1748] His thankfulness is anchored to a story in what God did in his life, thankful strength that God gave him, he's thankful for this worthiness, he's thankful for appointing him to his service.
[time=1759] But Paul isn't done there.
[time=1761] He keeps going with his story, Paul is not done showing how amazed and thankful he is for what Christ did on that road.
[time=1769] Listen to God in all of his life verse 13, there's more, verse 13, "Even though I was
[time=1775] once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I act in ignorance
[time=1781] and unbelief.
[time=1782] I love that there's an even though that our God gives us even though."
[time=1789] He was a blasphemer.
[time=1790] Somebody explained what a blasphemer is, it was someone who spoke evil of Christ.
[time=1795] I like to think of it, he talked trash about Jesus' mama.
[time=1799] He blasted me, he insulted him, carried, he called him names, it was a willful, deliberate and conscious effort to slap God in the face.
[time=1808] Even though I was that and he was a persecutor of the church, his persecution of the church
[time=1814] was pursued intensely, he tried to destroy it, he wanted it to be gone.
[time=1818] It was a physical and verbal harassment, it carries this idea of pursuing or chasing after just unrelenting continual, never stopping persecution.
[time=1828] He was chasing down people of the church, believers in the way and beating them, putting them into prison, even going as far as killing some of them.
[time=1837] Paul was a bad dude, even though I was a and there was just a violence to it and almost
[time=1844] a joy of satisfaction in insulting and humiliating people.
[time=1849] He enjoyed this almost.
[time=1852] This is who Paul was, and God chose him not by overlooking his past, but because of it.
[time=1860] God comes to Paul with all that Paul had done, even though, and says, "Yeah, I want you.
[time=1866] I know about your past.
[time=1867] I know all that you've done, all the evil you've committed, all the persecution of the church," and God says, "I want you to Paul." Timothy, he's entrusted me with this glorious gospel.
[time=1877] I'm so thankful, knowing he has saved me and transformed my life when I first met him on the road gives me strength and courage to eat, going, "Timothy, are you listening to
[time=1887] this story?" Timothy's probably heard it 50 times, if you know anything about Paul.
[time=1893] But Timothy, are you listening to this story?
[time=1896] Even though I was a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy.
[time=1901] Even though Paul did all that he did mercy, even though that we were the way we were mercy.
[time=1908] Even though we are the way we are today, even mercy.
[time=1913] Even though mercy, even though, even though, even though, I was shown mercy.
[time=1919] I thought about skipping the last part of that.
[time=1923] I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.
[time=1928] Just kind of when I was reading and studying, it just kind of hit me like, "Wait a minute.
[time=1932] I know that when you come to Jesus, you're saved by grace and not by works so you can't
[time=1938] boast." That's kind of been in grand.
[time=1940] We kind of get that.
[time=1941] The baptistic roots, the evangelical, that's kind of what you get, right?
[time=1944] That's good.
[time=1945] It's true.
[time=1946] He says, "I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance," and I'm like, "It just kind of hit me round." I'm like, "I'll just skip it.
[time=1953] They'll never notice." And I thought, "Nah, I shouldn't do that." So here's what I think is happening there.
[time=1958] Paul's kind of reflecting on the Old Testament distinction between unconscious and purposeful sinning.
[time=1964] His former conduct is not any less gross or sinful, but for Paul, this distinction just kind of helps him kind of handle that he became an object of compassion rather than wrath.
[time=1975] Paul's kind of talking about before he came to Christ.
[time=1978] And I think we do this.
[time=1979] We do this in our own stories.
[time=1981] We think back about our lives before we really started living with Jesus, and we have stories.
[time=1986] Maybe it starts with, "Oh, and then there's this one time went to the bar and then da-da-da-da-da." Or "Oh, and went to this part is one time and da-da-da-da-da." Or way back in college, I did-da-da-da-da, right?
[time=1997] And we kind of have those.
[time=1998] And those stories typically end with, "But that's before I was a Christian," as if that
[time=2004] now it doesn't matter.
[time=2005] It doesn't matter now, because it's before you're a Christian.
[time=2008] And yes, God has forgiven it and washed it clean, but it still matters.
[time=2011] But it helps us, this ignorance, and I believe that's kind of where we were, that it just kind of puts this category on it.
[time=2017] And my girls love to hear stories of what I was like, and what I did, and they really
[time=2025] love like the bad stories when I got into trouble, right?
[time=2029] And so we get to read stuff, and I tell them stories, and as they've grown, my stories have grown in ratings, you know, from G to PG to PG-13, we're going to stop there until
[time=2039] they're way older, like 40.
[time=2042] And so often they would, you know, I tell them a story, and they'd laugh, and then they'd say, "I can't believe you did that, dad.
[time=2048] What were you thinking?
[time=2049] How could you be so bad?" And here's what I always say, and the only thing I always said was, "I wasn't as bad as your mother."
[time=2063] And then I would say this.
[time=2065] All those things to me was before daddy or dad was a Christian, and that doesn't make
[time=2071] it okay.
[time=2072] That doesn't mean it's not wrong, but it provides them with a category of who I was before I was a Christian and who I am now.
[time=2080] And to be honest, some of the things that I did then, I still do now, but I just have a savior.
[time=2085] His name's Jesus, help me know him.
[time=2088] And so I think that's what Paul's doing there.
[time=2092] And so he, you know, this mercy, and where there's mercy with Paul, intimately and always following either before or after somewhere in the mix is this thing called grace.
[time=2101] It's intimately connected every single poem with Paul.
[time=2104] Verse 14, "The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus." And I love that imagery, poured out on me abundantly.
[time=2116] Paul's reflecting.
[time=2117] Remember, he's just thinking back when Jesus grabbed his heart, all the sin that was hanging on him, how dirty he was.
[time=2122] He slapped God in the face, he killed Christians, he had all this stuff, but I was shown mercy and now grace has been poured out on me abundantly with excess way more than you need, like
[time=2133] ketchup on fries or cheese on nachos or hot fudge on a Sunday, poured out on me abundantly.
[time=2143] It's poured out on Paul, like buckets of water, just drenching him, saturating with his grace, washing him clean and opening his eyes to faith in Christ and the love of Christ.
[time=2155] We define grace as this unmerited favor, getting what you don't deserve as much as needed
[time=2161] and more.
[time=2162] Grace is just this never-ending pouring out of grace and it's as much as needed and more
[time=2168] and then way more than that and even way, way more than that.
[time=2171] That's what I think of grace.
[time=2173] It is by grace you've been saved, Timothy, it's not the law or anything those knuckleheads are teaching there.
[time=2180] Here's my story, Timothy, see in my story the power of the one true gospel, Timothy.
[time=2186] This is what the gospel is, not the law, not what those guys are teaching, it's the power of the gospel, it's through Christ and I don't know your past and I don't know your present but I know what the grace of Christ can do to your future.
[time=2202] It is by grace we have been saved, not of ourselves, there is nothing we can do to fill our emptiness, of our life, nothing but only grace are we saved and when we have grace poured out on us, that which we didn't or couldn't or wouldn't believe will become true in our eyes like a veil open and like a door open, like a garage door growing up, we will see God in a way like we never have before.
[time=2223] The scriptures will start to make sense, the spirit will start to work in your life.
[time=2227] You don't have to clean yourself before you get here.
[time=2230] That's what Jesus will do when he pours grace all over your life.
[time=2235] That's what Paul is writing to Timothy, it's this, Timothy, it's the story, look at it,
[time=2241] it's not the law.
[time=2244] My life and I like to you, like we read, my daughters were growing up, we'd read books to them every night before bed, always, always, always, always.
[time=2254] And one of, you know, my mom read me this book is one of my favorites, there's a monster at the end of this book by Sesame Street Grover, you know, there should be a picture.
[time=2263] And so I loved reading it to my girls and these, you know, the whole idea of the book is Grover thinks there's a monster at the end of the book and he's trying not to let you turn the page and he turns, he's like, you turn the page, you know, he does that.
[time=2276] And I feel like today that Satan's mantra, when we open the pages of our scriptures, he doesn't want us to read it, he doesn't want us to memorize it or look at it.
[time=2286] He way prefers our Bibles be under our beds or in a closet or just lost completely.
[time=2292] He doesn't want us to turn those pages, he knows when we do that that the scriptures have truth in life and a God who sent his son to save sinners, he knows that's in there.
[time=2303] And when we do read it, you know, he's throwing everything at us, he's trying to distract us, he's trying to say it doesn't matter to you, this doesn't mean anything to me, it's boring, he wants us to think those things, it's outdated, it's untrue, it's full of lies.
[time=2315] And I feel like that's just today, Satan does not want me to read verse 15.
[time=2321] And I feel like he's got tape and bricks and building material and everything he can to get me from not reading verse 15, because I think this next verse is so powerful.
[time=2331] And I think it's Paul screaming, Timothy, Timothy, do you see my life?
[time=2338] Do you see what Jesus did in my life?
[time=2340] It's not the law, no law can do that, Timothy, only the one true gospel.
[time=2344] And here's the summary of that very gospel, Timothy, church, us here, we're listening to this message.
[time=2350] This will sustain the church, this is Timothy, hold to this, protect this, fight for this.
[time=2356] And here it is verse 15, here's a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance.
[time=2362] Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of who I am the worst.
[time=2367] When can we just sit there for a second?
[time=2369] You hear what we just heard in the scriptures?
[time=2371] Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.
[time=2376] Paul's story in Acts 9, we just saw, I mean, he was a bad dude and look what the gospel, the one true gospel did in his life.
[time=2383] Christ Jesus came into the world to say, it's in a Timothy, it's not the law, it's not miss, or genealogies, or hocus pocus, or carb diets, or a hobby, or counseling, or cosmetic surgery, or money, or fame, or popularity, or how many followers we have on Twitter, #WhoCares,
[time=2400] or the 1,230 for friends who we really don't know on Facebook, none of that can save, none of that can satisfy, none of that solves the problem of sin and death.
[time=2408] Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, it's the cross plus nothing, it's Jesus.
[time=2416] Did he come into the world to save semi messy people, to save people who have their act together, to save only those who did bad stuff in college, to save people who are religious, to save those who go to church, pay their taxes, get good grades, don't drink, smoke, or watch art-rated movies, who did he come to save?
[time=2431] Sinners.
[time=2433] [AMEN] Of which Paul says, I am the worst.
[time=2441] He's been transformed, but he still understands the power of sin in his life, but the gospel
[time=2455] can overcome.
[time=2456] He was a persecutor, he killed Christians, I'm just the worst.
[time=2462] Jesus had to come to him, why do you persecute me?
[time=2466] And Paul turns and starts to preach to Jesus, Son of God, and plants, churches, and writes them a great majority of our New Testament.
[time=2473] Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, Timothy, Timothy, Timothy, Timothy.
[time=2478] This is the power of the one true gospel, hold on to it, fight for it.
[time=2481] Jesus Christ came into the world to save Paul.
[time=2484] He came into the world to save me, he came into the world to save raves and Josh and Steve and you.
[time=2491] He came into the world to save your neighbor, your co-worker, your friend, your family, your kids, your mean boss.
[time=2499] Can he save Oprah?
[time=2500] No judgment on her soul or turn of security, I'm just using her as an illustration.
[time=2504] Can he save Oprah?
[time=2505] Yep.
[time=2506] Ray Rice?
[time=2507] Yep.
[time=2508] OJ?
[time=2509] Yep.
[time=2510] The guy who just told you that you're number one, when you accidentally cut him off in the world, yep.
[time=2521] Can he save your mother-in-law?
[time=2524] Yep.
[time=2526] Yeah, he can.
[time=2532] No one is outside the reach of God's mercy and grace, no one, because Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners.
[time=2539] Can I give you just four key ideas of that little summary of the gospel?
[time=2545] First one is this, it's trustworthy and true.
[time=2551] So we don't believe in Jesus because it works or it feels good or it seems okay, we'll leave because it's true and it's trusted.
[time=2562] It's not the false stuff, Timothy, it's the true stuff, it's the only stuff.
[time=2569] Second one, it's universal.
[time=2572] It's for everyone, it's for all.
[time=2578] No one is outside the reach, no one is outside the grasp, the scope of grace and mercy.
[time=2583] He died on the cross, it's for everyone.
[time=2587] Third thing, it's all about Jesus and His work on the cross.
[time=2592] It's centered at the cross and only the cross.
[time=2595] The purpose of Christ for coming to save sinners by dying on the cross is that payment for our sin that is demanded by Justin Holy God, the law is meant to point out and condense
[time=2604] in the gospel, the one true gospel was meant to save and redeem and restore relationship
[time=2610] to God in a way that the law simply cannot.
[time=2613] Through Jesus we are reconciled to God, that big picture story and through Jesus we can
[time=2619] be a people for God, we can be God's people, His sons and daughters, only through Christ,
[time=2626] only through the cross and the fourth.
[time=2630] It must be individually chosen.
[time=2633] This gospel is personal, it's universal, it's for all, but it must individually be chosen.
[time=2639] It's so personal, every one of us has a different story, an upbringing, a way, a life, a different
[time=2645] thing that happened to us, Paul's story is unique to Paul, my story is unique to me and your story is unique to you, but the offer is to all, but each one of us has to individually
[time=2656] kind of wrestle that with God.
[time=2658] We have to talk to God, we have to ask God, we have to say, "God I want you in my life,
[time=2665] I want to know you, I want to know I see what you did, look what you did in Paul's life, oh I need that in my life." It's a personal thing, it's when we place our trust in Christ, when we become in Christ
[time=2677] then we are saved, not of ourselves.
[time=2679] God wants to save us all and He wants to use us all, our past, our present and our future.
[time=2684] My only question with that is, have we made that decision today?
[time=2690] Just think about it, just ask yourself, have I made that personal decision to follow the
[time=2696] Jesus of the Scriptures?
[time=2702] And if you're not there today, it's all good, we keep taking steps, we keep asking questions,
[time=2709] do you talk with somebody about that, because it's the power of the one true gospel.
[time=2716] Verse 15, "Here's a trustworthy saying that just full acceptance Christ, Jesus came into the world to save sinners and this last part, I just want to make sure we get this, of whom
[time=2727] I am the worst." And Paul didn't go investigate, he didn't go take a checklist of all ready else's sins, he just has this keen awareness, he's been awakened by the spirit of his sin, which he
[time=2739] feels like he can claim to be the worst of sinners.
[time=2742] But can I tell you this today, God's plan is bigger than your sin.
[time=2746] The theological conclusion of the Joseph's story in the Old Testament, what man meant for evil, God meant for good, God can overcome any circumstance, any sin, any misstep, any
[time=2757] I messed up, because God is painting on the canvas the size of the universe and all we
[time=2763] get is a sticky note.
[time=2765] We don't see all the things that God's doing all the way around us, all the time constantly sustaining, constantly planning, working his plan to carrying his will.
[time=2773] We don't see it, so our sin, Paul's sin was a part of God working, because it says this
[time=2779] was a chance for God to display the unlimited patience through Paul, through what he did,
[time=2788] unlimited patience of Christ.
[time=2789] Verse 16, it says, "I am the worst." Verse 16, "But for that very reason, I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners,
[time=2798] Christ used my display, his unlimited or immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life." Paul's life, Paul's sin, Paul's story was there.
[time=2810] God planned it in such a way so that Christ might display his patience.
[time=2816] It's just amazing, it's beautiful, and he can do the same in your life, because whatever your story is, whatever your past is, God will never, not ever waste a hurt.
[time=2830] He's going to use your story, so when you think you can't come in here because you're too dirty or you're too messed up, that's why God wants you here.
[time=2840] So people just like us in this room can hear, "Wow, look what God did in his life.
[time=2846] Look what God did in her life." He's displaying his unlimited patience and his mercy and his grace are just right around it too.
[time=2853] That's what God does.
[time=2854] That's what our God is like.
[time=2856] He is this amazing, sovereign, powerful.
[time=2859] He sent Jesus, the one true gospel, to save sinners.
[time=2868] Paul is the baddest of the baddest.
[time=2869] He was the worst of the worst, but that's why God chose to save him.
[time=2874] There was no accident.
[time=2875] The hero of Paul's story isn't Paul, it's Jesus.
[time=2879] The hero of my story isn't me, it's Jesus, the hero of your story, I hope it's Jesus.
[time=2885] Timothy, are you hearing this?
[time=2893] And then verse 17, Paul, it's almost like he can't contain himself.
[time=2897] He just breaks into this absolute praise of celebration, out of the king eternally mortal and invisible, the only God, the honor and glory forever and ever.
[time=2907] [AMEN] He just kind of just blows up because he's thinking back of his story.
[time=2911] The band comes forward and the choir and the band, whoever else needs to be after it.
[time=2916] Come on up, it's all good, we'll bother me.
[time=2919] I just want to give you a couple application points.
[time=2925] Timothy, Timothy, Timothy, this is the power of the one true gospel.
[time=2931] It's not the law, it's all about mercy and grace found in Jesus Christ our Savior.
[time=2937] It can overcome our past, sustain our present, provide hope for our future.
[time=2943] In our world today, you see it on our TV shows, our world is all about changed lives, extreme
[time=2949] makeovers and radical transformations.
[time=2952] But unless the transformation comes through Christ, it won't last.
[time=2958] The transformation that Jesus brings through the one true gospel is earth shattering, angel rejoicing, heaven-shaking, eternity altering, that's what God does, that's what Jesus does.
[time=2968] And until we choose to follow Christ and allow Him to pour mercy and pour grace in us and
[time=2974] saturate us with faith and love, we are trying to do it on our own.
[time=2978] We're still trusting in ourselves to find meaning and fulfillment.
[time=2983] We're still trusting in the law.
[time=2987] We are still chained to that reality until Jesus breaks us free and opens our eyes to
[time=2993] the one true gospel, a couple application points, here we go, the first one.
[time=2998] We find a place, what do you do with a message like this, this gospel thing, where you find a place where you can share your story and you can learn about God's story.
[time=3007] We have all kinds of groups around this place, smaller settings, where you can go, you can be known, cared for and held accountable, celebrate recovery is a great place where grace just is poured out on you.
[time=3020] That's just one example, there's so many that we haven't been at the guest center, talked to one of our elders, find a group, find a transformation, a smaller community where you can hear your story, learn your story, learn God's story, where you can just get to know God's story, because life change happens best in smaller settings, circles are better
[time=3037] than rows.
[time=3038] The second thing, maybe it's time to serve, maybe it's time to serve.
[time=3044] Even in the room, you heard this message today and it's just flat line, I mean, we're talking about the power of the one true gospel.
[time=3054] Another place in the universe has this story with this much God and history and truth in
[time=3061] it.
[time=3062] I mean, if that didn't get your heart pumping, then maybe you're spiritually constipated.
[time=3066] Maybe it's time to start investing in somebody else, maybe it's time to start pouring out because you've sat in so long enough.
[time=3073] We need people, teenagers need to hear your story, adults, you guys need to share each
[time=3079] other's stories.
[time=3080] We need to hear what God did in our lives.
[time=3085] That's how we know that we're normal.
[time=3088] That's how we know it's okay that, hey, I struggle in my marriage, oh, me too.
[time=3092] Let's talk about it.
[time=3093] Oh, you mean you can say that up front and that's true.
[time=3096] Absolutely, I can say it up front.
[time=3097] If I didn't say it, I'd be lying and I know you are too.
[time=3101] I'm married.
[time=3102] I get it.
[time=3103] You're married.
[time=3104] I get it.
[time=3105] I know what's going on.
[time=3106] Right?
[time=3107] If you're single, I get it.
[time=3108] I know what the struggle is.
[time=3109] Am I ever getting married?
[time=3110] I get it.
[time=3111] We just need to be in.
[time=3112] Maybe it's time to serve people need to hear each other.
[time=3114] We need to serve.
[time=3115] They need to hear your hurts.
[time=3117] It's time.
[time=3122] It's just the last thing, maybe it's just time to think long and hard and ask yourself,
[time=3129] what are you trusting in?
[time=3130] What's your life about?
[time=3133] Are you trusting in the one true gospel?
[time=3140] The gospel that has Jesus at the center with grace and mercy are poured out abundantly.
[time=3145] Like I said before, I don't know your past.
[time=3148] I don't know your present, but I know what God can do to your future when he pours that out this grace and this mercy on your life.
[time=3156] That transformation we see in Paul's story, that can be life and it's real and it's true.
[time=3164] It's lasting, it's eternal.
[time=3169] We're going to sing a song called Amazing Grace.
[time=3173] My chains are free and my chains are gone.
[time=3178] Next time I heard this, I was in Ocean City, New Jersey, 1996 on a mission trip.
[time=3186] We sang hymns in this particular church.
[time=3188] I was helping around and serving it and all that kind of stuff.
[time=3192] I didn't know how to sing a hymn.
[time=3193] I didn't understand.
[time=3194] I grew up my first church experiences in a movie theater.
[time=3196] We didn't have hymns, but I remember reading the song and hearing the song song and when it clicked in my brain, that's me.
[time=3206] This song, Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=3211] I once was lost, yeah, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I sing.
[time=3217] Towards grace it taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved.
[time=3222] How precious did that grace appear, the hour I first believe and I remember what it was like when I first believed.
[time=3229] I remember that.
[time=3232] My chains are gone.
[time=3233] I've been set free.
[time=3234] My God, my Savior has ransomed me.
[time=3237] And like a flood, grace, mercy poured out His mercy reigns, unending love.
[time=3242] Amazing Grace.
[time=3243] [AMEN] Sing with us.
[time=3247] Sing with us on there, Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=3263] I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I sing.
[time=3292] Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=3307] Amazing Grace, how precious did that grace appear, the hour I first believed.
[time=3323] My chains are gone, I've been set free.
[time=3332] My God, my Savior has ransomed me.
[time=3340] And like a flood, His mercy reigns, unending love, Amazing Grace.
[time=3357] The Lord has promised good to me, His word, my Lord, silicures, He will my shield, and
[time=3384] my heart, and my heart, and my heart, my heart, my heart, my God, my Savior has ransomed
[time=3400] me.
[time=3401] And like a flood, grace, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy poured out His mercy reigns, unending
[time=3410] love.
[time=3411] And like a flood, His mercy reigns, unending love, Amazing Grace.
[time=3427] The urge shall soon dissolve like so, in the sun for bed to shine, but God will call
[time=3453] me.
[time=3457] We will be forever mine, we will be forever mine, you are forever mine, sing that course
[time=3480] again.
[time=3481] And like a flood, His mercy reigns, unending love, Amazing Grace.
[time=3553] And like a flood, His mercy reigns, unending love, Amazing Grace, mercy reigns, unending
[time=3562] love, Amazing Grace.
[time=3562] And like a flood, His mercy reigns, unending love, Amazing Grace.
