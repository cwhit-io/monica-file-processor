[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] Well, good morning everyone, my name is Steve Webster, and I've had the privilege for several years of serving as a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=41] There are so many wonderful things going on here in and among us that we just want you to know about and to be a part of.
[time=49] We have always seen you, we see you this morning as part of our church family, and we would love for you to come see us, to contact us, to follow us on our Twitter address.
[time=59] On our Twitter account at behawkmin to go to Facebook and follow us there at Black Hawk Ministries to email us.
[time=67] There's ways to contact us on our church website that are available for you, that have always been there available for you.
[time=73] But we want to just speak again and remind you that you are part of our church family and that we are grateful that you're watching and want you to be informed about all that's going on so that you can be a part of it.
[time=84] And so you can come be a part of it with us, certainly over the airwaves this morning, but also in person.
[time=90] Should that be available to you?
[time=93] There's a lot going on, like I said this morning.
[time=95] We're continuing this morning in First Timothy.
[time=98] First Timothy is a letter written by Paul to Timothy that runs directly against the culture in which we live.
[time=107] And this morning's message that I'll be sharing with you is no exception.
[time=112] There is a real need for Timothy to be strong and to be courageous.
[time=117] And the same thing is true for us as we have received this truth implanted in our souls to be strong and to be courageous and to not serve timidly.
[time=127] To be confident, to be clear, not to be arrogant, but to be gracious as we share the truth that there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.
[time=139] So this week and next week, we're working our way through the end of chapter one in First Timothy and through chapter two.
[time=145] I'm really excited to lay out how it's possible for us to say perhaps unpopular things in a gracious and compassionate and in a loving way.
[time=155] You're also going to hear updates this morning about our church and how things are going in a season of transition.
[time=161] So that's something else that we want you to know about as well be prepared as you see it this morning.
[time=166] To pray with us, I cannot tell you, I've preached many times from the pulpit here in our sanctuary how grateful I am to know that people are praying for us.
[time=176] And I just want to encourage you this morning that the most important thing that you can do for Blackuck Ministries by way of support is to please keep praying for us.
[time=185] And when we know that you are, just write us and tell us that you are or post on Facebook or at our Twitter account that you're praying.
[time=192] And I cannot tell you the amount of strength that that gives us to faithfully serve him day by day.
[time=198] There is no more encouraging thing from person to person or from person to ministry than to know that we're praying for each other.
[time=206] So thank you again for watching and for being a part of our church family. Please come see us, please contact us at all the different places that you can on Twitter, on Facebook, on our website, and we look forward to seeing you very, very soon.
[time=236] [MUSIC]
[time=266] You're the defender of the week, you comfort those in me, you lift us up on wings like the old.
[time=287] You may be seated now.
[time=296] [MUSIC - 110 seconds]
[time=412] Scars and struggles on the way, but with joy our hearts can say.
[time=419] Never once did we ever walk alone, carried by your constant grace, held within your perfect peace.
[time=431] Never once, no we never walked alone.
[time=445] Never once did you leave us alone.
[time=451] You are faithful God, you are faithful.
[time=457] Every step we are breathing in your grace.
[time=463] evermore will be breathing out your wings you are faithful God you are faithful
[time=475] you are faithful God you are faithful
[time=506] good morning my name is Rick Raber I'm one of the elders serving you here in our body and as we enter a time to reflect on communion and what that means we want
[time=518] to invite our live stream and Bible our listeners to join us is in this time of
[time=524] honoring a very specific very specific account that Jesus called us to and also
[time=533] Paul did that we examine ourselves in 1 Corinthians 11 Paul actually calls us to
[time=543] examine ourselves and even says it really specifically therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup in an unworthy manner will be guilty of
[time=559] sinning against the body and blood of the Lord this isn't something to be
[time=568] entered into lightly but Webby so graciously reminded me that the word
[time=575] Eucharist also has a celebration thanks giving component to it so while we get
[time=582] solemn and it tends to take us to a quiet time never do we want want to stop and
[time=591] forget what we just saying never do we once want to stop and consider the price
[time=598] that was paid so whether you're watching or you're sitting here with us this is
[time=604] a time for examination the word says for wherever two or three are gathered in my
[time=611] name and just for the record that's what we're doing here today in the name of Jesus Christ we're gathered he is there with us so that makes it a holy place
[time=625] not the pews not Black Hawk name nothing the fact of Jesus Christ his blood his
[time=631] death his burial his resurrection that's what we're here to celebrate so we're here to celebrate it be reminded of it and so as we sing and as the guests and
[time=643] the ushers and the elders come forward just take the time to consider what
[time=652] examination means what it means to remember his sacrifice what it means to
[time=658] remember his sacrifice and at the same time to be reminded and reflect of our
[time=666] own covering that that blood covers so take this time praise sing do that as we
[time=674] share there is one thing that I'll give you a little bit of a different we're doing one cup excuse me one grab there's a cup with the juice and a cup with the
[time=684] bread coupled together so you grab them both at the same time and then we'll take them together at the end
[time=718] sing with us Jesus Messiah name of all names bless every deep learn and man you
[time=748] rest for sinners the ransom from heaven Jesus Messiah Lord of all is party the
[time=776] bread his blood the wine broken in order all for love the whole earth tremble and
[time=790] the veil was torn love so amazing love so amazing
[time=806] Jesus Messiah name of all names bless every deeper
[time=822] he's the rescue for sinners he's a ransom from Jesus
[time=852] [MUSIC - 90 seconds]
[time=949] - One thing that I was reminded of this week,
[time=957] as I considered the communion time,
[time=963] is every passage Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Paul says this.
[time=968] The Lord Jesus, on the night, he was betrayed.
[time=975] Think about what betrayal stirs up in your heart,
[time=981] and he knew what was coming.
[time=985] And he grabbed the bread, and he grabbed the cup.
[time=991] Something they were used to doing all the time at Passover.
[time=994] Something they, he said, as often as you do this, as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup.
[time=1004] 'Cause sometimes it can be a thing of habit for that.
[time=1009] Do it in remembrance of me.
[time=1013] And even in Matthew, he says, this is the new covenant in my blood, which is for the forgiveness of sins.
[time=1022] Remember, that's why, that's why.
[time=1027] And so, he says, in the same way after he took the cup
[time=1034] and said, this is the new covenant of my blood.
[time=1037] Whenever you do it, do this in remembrance of me.
[time=1040] Let me pray for us, and then we'll take the cup.
[time=1045] Jesus, Messiah, name above all names, beautiful Savior, glorious Lord, Emmanuel, God with us, even in this room, right now.
[time=1058] We don't have to ask you to be here because you are.
[time=1063] And so, as we take this bread, and we take this cup,
[time=1072] help us to be remembering of the great sacrifice that you gave.
[time=1077] It's in your name, we pray, Jesus, amen.
[time=1081] So, he broke the bread, let's do it together.
[time=1086] It wasn't just his body that was broken for you
[time=1095] because there were many people that were put up on a cross and crucified.
[time=1102] It was his shed blood that makes the difference.
[time=1106] The shed blood of Jesus, let's do that together.
[time=1110] We rejoice, Father.
[time=1116] We rejoice in the tension this morning of communion, of the blessing, of the sacrifice, and of the thanksgiving that you call us to.
[time=1127] God, thank you for helping us to be solemn examiners.
[time=1131] Search our hearts, oh God, test us.
[time=1134] And thank you that you do that.
[time=1136] But God, let us live in Romans eight one.
[time=1138] There is therefore now no condemnation, there are those that are in Christ Jesus, for the law of the spirit of life has set us free.
[time=1145] Let us celebrate that today.
[time=1147] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1149] Take out your Bibles, your phones, or whatever.
[time=1156] And go with me, please, to first Timothy chapter one, verse 18, I want to read through this with you as you stand with me together.
[time=1164] First Timothy one, starting in verse 18, reading through chapter two, verse seven, Josh and Jesse, two dear friends of mine, have kicked us off in this series.
[time=1173] In first Timothy, as we're trying to live out this faith that God has given to us, and he's provided for us, let's read the passage today, and kind of lay out the outline of it.
[time=1186] And I'll take this week and next week to be faithful to what God has said.
[time=1191] So here it is, this is first Timothy chapter one, starting in verse 18, we're gonna read all the way through verse seven that we can get started.
[time=1198] This charge, I entrust to you, Timothy, my child,
[time=1204] in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, holding faith, and a good conscience.
[time=1215] By rejecting this, some have made shipwreck of their faith, among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
[time=1228] Chapter two, first of all, then I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings, and all who are in high positions that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way, this is good.
[time=1249] And it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=1256] There is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all, which the testimony given at the proper time.
[time=1268] For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle, I am telling the truth, I'm not lying, a teacher of the Gentiles, in faith and truth.
[time=1278] This is God's word, you may be seated.
[time=1280] I don't know how much you watch the news.
[time=1290] We've talked about this before a little bit, but it's been a rough stretch.
[time=1296] The last season of time in our world has been exceptionally troubled on a lot of fronts.
[time=1303] And so what Arlen prayed, just a minute ago, it can slip through our fingers.
[time=1308] I mean, not fretting, not worrying.
[time=1311] That's hard to do when so many things are spinning off their axis every day.
[time=1315] When every morning it's like something new has happened.
[time=1318] I understand that.
[time=1321] In fact, it's so bad that the host of "The Tonight Show," Jimmy Fallon, has made up a segment on his show called, I've got good news and I've got good news, in which news anchors read fake stories that are good news.
[time=1334] He has to make stuff up, just to encourage us.
[time=1336] That's how discouraging it can get out there sometimes.
[time=1340] I understand that.
[time=1342] We've talked before about the need to not get caught up in our circumstances.
[time=1347] And it's remarkable to me, Timothy, and the one who writes to Timothy, Paul, are both facing real hardship.
[time=1355] I mean, genuine hardship that we'll talk about this morning.
[time=1359] I've been reading through this passage for some time and it's been a great blessing to me already.
[time=1366] And I've shared the quote I'm about to share with you guys today about six times during the week that's been so blessed by it.
[time=1373] I love living in the 21st century.
[time=1375] And here's one reason why.
[time=1377] This book, from which the quote is taken, I'm about to read with you, it's been on my radar for some time.
[time=1383] I keep stumbling across quotes from it like, "That's amazing, that's amazing, that's amazing." And I couldn't find it, it's been out of print.
[time=1388] Well, I found it in the UK at a bookstore for like five pounds, whatever that is, five pounds.
[time=1395] And that was on Monday, I ordered the book and by Friday it was in my mailbox.
[time=1401] It's unbelievable.
[time=1402] A book in the UK for five pounds in my mailbox by Friday.
[time=1406] I love living in 21st century.
[time=1408] There it was, all the way across the world.
[time=1410] And my virtue of that friends, now it's here for you.
[time=1415] Two, I have no doubt that there are people in this room that need to hear this this morning.
[time=1421] They need to be encouraged by this.
[time=1422] I want this to read this over you and for you to be blessed and encouraged by what you hear.
[time=1429] So here we go.
[time=1429] It hurts him, that is Jesus, that we are so fretted and over anxious to him that seems insulting to God.
[time=1444] Oh men, he once sighed, taken aback by it, how little you trust him.
[time=1450] And indeed we do.
[time=1451] To doubt the fact of God in a world so full of him seemed to Christ a pathetic blindness.
[time=1459] But to know of him and yet be worried and fretted
[time=1465] and care worn, that was real unbelief and it struck him with a kind of horror.
[time=1473] He could never grow accustomed to it.
[time=1475] If you really knew God, he kept saying to the uneasy, fussing people around him, your hearts too would be filled with the healing rush of a great peace.
[time=1488] Yes, even in this hazardous world of ours, so full of uncertainty and trouble and yours would be the joy of children who know they have a father to take care of them.
[time=1504] And that they do not need to bother about things but can quite safely fill their days with carefree happiness.
[time=1512] That is the Galilean accent, the spirit of Christ.
[time=1517] AJ Gossip wrote that in 1926.
[time=1521] And things were going pretty well in 1926.
[time=1523] On both sides of the ocean, the economy was booming, it was called the Roaring 20s for a reason.
[time=1528] That all changed not long after that.
[time=1531] So he wasn't writing this in some happy, clappy way.
[time=1534] He was part of his wife died the year if you wrote this book, very suddenly.
[time=1538] And AJ Gossip made his name as a preacher to World War II veterans on the front lines, serving to them faithfully.
[time=1546] He calls the world around him in 1926 hazardous and full of uncertainty and trouble and how much more friends or how much can we identify with that.
[time=1557] We live in the same kind of world and we are prone to the same kind of worry and fretting.
[time=1562] And my encouragement to you from the word of God this morning is to rest.
[time=1569] The message this morning is entitled holding faith.
[time=1573] And that seems an important thing for us to do, especially in these days.
[time=1578] Let's jump in here.
[time=1579] There's an outline in your bulletins.
[time=1580] If you wanna follow along, there's just three words to fill out, three verbs.
[time=1585] And I pray that those verbs would be an accurate reflection of the text and that they would encourage you this morning.
[time=1591] You guys are looking good today, by the way, this group here looking very good, down front.
[time=1595] So good job.
[time=1597] Chapter one, verse 18.
[time=1598] This is really strong language and it doesn't do any good to act like it's not.
[time=1605] So it is.
[time=1606] And we're gonna work through it together carefully.
[time=1609] Paul's talking to Timothy.
[time=1610] This charge I entrust to you, Timothy, my child.
[time=1616] This charge, this announcement, this command.
[time=1622] This has happened in the previous weeks and Jesse Hannah last week talked about the power of the one true gospel.
[time=1628] That Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners.
[time=1631] That is the gospel.
[time=1633] That is the good news.
[time=1634] It's not good advice.
[time=1636] It's good news that it has been done for you already.
[time=1641] And at this point, I'll stop.
[time=1642] I'll come back to it later.
[time=1643] I wanna tell you a story.
[time=1645] I heard this from, so Tim Keller is telling this story about another sermon that he heard.
[time=1650] So it's a sermon and a sermon and a sermon real quick.
[time=1652] That's okay.
[time=1653] Stay with me.
[time=1655] The story is this.
[time=1656] This is the nature of the good news of the gospel.
[time=1660] It's not good advice.
[time=1662] Here's a story that I'll stop now and tell.
[time=1664] I'm gonna tell it later, but I can't help myself.
[time=1666] I'm telling now.
[time=1666] Imagine that there's a king who sends his army to a far away place to fight a battle.
[time=1673] And battle is won.
[time=1674] He sends back messengers.
[time=1677] He sends back heralds, saying the battle is over.
[time=1682] It's been won.
[time=1683] Live in freedom.
[time=1684] Rejoice in the hard won victory on your behalf.
[time=1689] There is nothing you need to do.
[time=1692] Herald's are sent back to say this.
[time=1694] If on the other hand, the battle does not go well in the far away country, the king sends back military advisors.
[time=1699] And he sends, and he says, horsemen, over here.
[time=1703] Marksmen, over there.
[time=1704] We gotta fight for our lives.
[time=1706] Martin Lloyd-Jones says that every other religious system in the world sends back military advisors and not heralds.
[time=1714] Not good newsers.
[time=1717] Military advisors do this, do this, do this.
[time=1720] The gospel is good news.
[time=1722] It's been done.
[time=1726] Rest in that this morning.
[time=1728] Timothy needs courage to face the task he has to face.
[time=1733] Chapter one is filled with danger, with different doctrine, with myths, with endless genealogies.
[time=1739] He says, Timothy, I am entrusting you with these things.
[time=1742] This is a serious thing.
[time=1745] You can do it.
[time=1746] He calls Timothy my child.
[time=1748] He loves him.
[time=1749] He loves him dearly.
[time=1751] And we can't miss the warmly personal nature of early Christianity.
[time=1756] The Paul and Timothy were just like that.
[time=1759] It's really hard to read the Bible.
[time=1761] It's amazing how much the Bible will mess with you.
[time=1764] It just will, if you actually read it.
[time=1766] It will just mess with you.
[time=1768] You can't be comfortable having actually read it.
[time=1771] And so, we might say our culture says, you can do it on your own.
[time=1776] You can make it on your own.
[time=1777] It's very American.
[time=1779] It's a very American ideal that we're individuals.
[time=1782] We can do this.
[time=1783] My own bootstraps.
[time=1784] Here I go.
[time=1786] But in the Bible, faith is a community project.
[time=1790] And we need each other.
[time=1791] We really, really do.
[time=1793] We have all kinds of opportunities for you to connect in smaller settings.
[time=1797] We say this all the time.
[time=1798] It's still true.
[time=1799] We still do.
[time=1801] 'Cause we believe that faith is just that friends.
[time=1803] A community project.
[time=1805] And Paul and Timothy love each other.
[time=1807] And what Paul is about to say here, to Timothy is supposed to encourage him in his community.
[time=1812] Watch.
[time=1813] I entrust you, Timothy, my child, verse 18, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you.
[time=1820] Timothy, this is number one in your outline.
[time=1823] Timothy is encouraged by Paul to serve confidently.
[time=1827] Because of what God has said about him in community.
[time=1834] In 1 Timothy 4, verse 14, it says this, referring back to what Paul has just said.
[time=1839] He says to Timothy, in chapter four, verse 14, don't neglect the gift you have, which was given to you by prophecy when the Council of Elders laid their hands on you.
[time=1850] Some, a word about prophecy, real quick.
[time=1854] It's a very, it's a word it's often misunderstood.
[time=1857] In the Bible, prophecy sometimes means telling the future.
[time=1860] Most people think of prophecy in that way.
[time=1862] But most of the time, vast majority of the time, it's about forth telling.
[time=1867] It's about saying hard, true things.
[time=1870] In the Old Testament, it's almost all of what Isaiah is.
[time=1872] It's about to the people of Israel, you can do it, you can bear up under hard times.
[time=1878] So someone said this way, that the prophecy is foretelling, that's a part of it, but it's also foretelling.
[time=1886] And Timothy received a word from these elders.
[time=1890] But Timothy, you're gonna serve God in this way and don't doubt it.
[time=1893] Timothy clearly does doubt it.
[time=1895] He clearly has this timidity, this fear about, I can't do it, I'm just a kid.
[time=1900] Let no one look down on you.
[time=1902] Because of your youth.
[time=1904] But being an example, that was to Timothy.
[time=1906] So I encourage you, this morning friends as well, the Bible is filled up, filled up with statements about who you are as a child of God and because of that, what you are able to do.
[time=1920] And you can serve him confidently in that knowledge.
[time=1923] We can confidently commission missionaries to go on our behalf.
[time=1929] As you pray, as Arlen encouraged you to pray for us in terms of our financial situation, I'm grateful for their transparency and for their willingness just to come and talk with you this morning.
[time=1938] It's really encouraging to me.
[time=1940] I pray that number never goes below 10%.
[time=1944] I hope it would double in the days to come that we would just send missionaries and missionaries and more missionaries that would never, ever, ever decrease.
[time=1952] We can commission missionaries friends in confidence to know that God will be with them in Uganda and in Kenya and in India and in Poland.
[time=1960] Wherever they go to the ends of the earth because Christ promised those things to them many, many years ago.
[time=1967] We can serve confidently in the light of what God has said we can trust him.
[time=1972] Timothy had to do this in verse 18.
[time=1974] He had to wage the good warfare.
[time=1976] That's hard.
[time=1977] That's how ministry feels sometimes.
[time=1980] It feels like warfare.
[time=1981] And sometimes in ways it should and sometimes in ways that it shouldn't.
[time=1986] So Timothy says you can have confidence.
[time=1988] Paul says Timothy, you can have confidence to know that you can do it, Timothy.
[time=1993] Because what this community has said about you, faith is a community project.
[time=1998] In first Timothy six, toward the end of this letter here's what he says on this front.
[time=2003] Fight the good fight of faith.
[time=2006] This is verse Timothy 6, 12.
[time=2007] Fight the good fight of the faith.
[time=2009] Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession watch in the presence of many witnesses.
[time=2018] You can't find a New Testament example of somebody winging it on their own.
[time=2024] When you do, it's almost always bad news.
[time=2027] So Paul has this community context all around Timothy.
[time=2032] Timothy has a hard job to do.
[time=2033] He has to wage the good warfare.
[time=2037] Someone said the Christian ministry is more than proclamation, it's combat.
[time=2042] And Paul uses that language all over these letters about fighting the good fight of faith and waging the good warfare and endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus in second Timothy chapter two.
[time=2053] This is second Timothy two, verse one, and I want to read this over you this morning.
[time=2060] Second Timothy two, verse one, says this.
[time=2061] It won't be, there it is.
[time=2063] You then my child be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
[time=2067] That story about the good newsers versus military advisors, heralds versus military advisors.
[time=2074] I've told that story many, many times over the last three months and my heart has been strengthened by that grace.
[time=2079] That's what grace is.
[time=2081] You don't have to do it more than that.
[time=2084] You can't do it.
[time=2085] It's been done for you.
[time=2087] And so my heart this morning is strengthened by that grace and it's exactly what Paul says to Timothy that you are having a difficult time and so has Paul.
[time=2097] This is the last letter that Paul likely writes in his life, second Timothy.
[time=2103] He's at the end, that becomes pretty obvious later on.
[time=2107] Share in suffering, verse three, chapter two, second Timothy, share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
[time=2113] You're gonna have to do that when you serve confidently, serve knowing that this is true, that you can do it together.
[time=2120] Hebrews 13, this was ringing in my ears as we saying Jesus Messiah this morning.
[time=2125] Hebrews 13 verses seven and eight.
[time=2127] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.
[time=2132] Do not be led away by diverse and strange teachings for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace.
[time=2139] Diverse and strange teachings.
[time=2141] Two weeks ago, Josh mentioned that, opens first Timothy chapter one.
[time=2146] Paul has suffered much for the cause of Christ.
[time=2149] In second Timothy four, he says, "Famously I fought the good fight, I finished the race, I've kept the faith." Paul wants Timothy to be able to say that.
[time=2160] Timothy isn't there where Paul is.
[time=2161] Paul's at 30 years of ministry, at the very end, he says, "I've done it, I fought the good fight.
[time=2167] I kept the faith." Timothy, what a great legacy that would be if you could say that too after 30 years.
[time=2175] It's his prayer for him.
[time=2176] Serve confidently, Timothy.
[time=2179] Serve confidently, Black Hawk.
[time=2181] In light of what God has said about you, you are an heir because of what Christ is then you are an heir, a joint heir with Jesus.
[time=2191] But it's his description of you.
[time=2192] You can do whatever you have to do in light of that truth.
[time=2197] I've told you before about Lucy and Charlie Brown.
[time=2200] I'll say it again, it seems appropriate.
[time=2202] God is not Lucy.
[time=2204] It's against, as profound as it was the first time I said it.
[time=2208] Lucy yanks the football away from Charlie Brown and he falls in his face and is made a fool of.
[time=2213] So God says to Doug and Nancy, "Go and do whatever it is."
[time=2219] And when he says that to you, he will empower you to do it.
[time=2222] He will be with you every step of the way.
[time=2224] It's each one of us.
[time=2227] He won't leave you hanging.
[time=2228] Look at verse 19, "Holding faith in the good conscious." This isn't like holding like, you know, my kids are getting older and so holding my hand is not quite as, like they used to just clutch on, you know.
[time=2241] Now they're just sort of like, you know.
[time=2243] The word holding there isn't like my kids now, it's my kids then.
[time=2246] It's clutching, it's clinging.
[time=2249] "Hold firmly to faith in the good conscience." Verse 19, "By rejecting this, some have made shipwreck
[time=2260] of their faith." This is drastic stuff.
[time=2264] This is tragic.
[time=2265] Shipwrecking of your faith.
[time=2267] Shipwreck for Paul is different than shipwreck for us.
[time=2269] We think shipwreck, we think that cruise ship that turned over by Italy, remember that?
[time=2274] Can I sit there for a long, long time?
[time=2276] It's still tragic.
[time=2278] It's still horrible, but a different picture.
[time=2281] Shipwreck is an evocative term for everybody.
[time=2283] It's like, whoa, their faith has been shipwrecked.
[time=2286] These guys in verse 20, they're named here, verse 20,
[time=2292] "Among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, they have shipwrecked their faith, and there are others apparently.
[time=2298] Among whom are these two guys?" It says, "Who might have handed over to Satan, they may learn not to blaspheme." Strong language.
[time=2310] If these two are handed over to Satan, that means to be put outside the church.
[time=2315] It's excommunicated.
[time=2318] This is rare.
[time=2319] It's severe, but it's restorative.
[time=2321] What does it say there?
[time=2323] Handed over to Satan that they may learn, not just get out of here.
[time=2327] Hope that when you discipline your kids that has that same, your discipline is that way.
[time=2333] There is a wrong to be righted, to be sure.
[time=2335] It might be drastic, but is it restorative?
[time=2339] This church discipline here is restorative.
[time=2342] It's designed to teach them something.
[time=2344] Paul is exercising authority here in the church, friends.
[time=2348] We are trying to follow these examples here at Blackhawk with your elders and those that serve you as pastors.
[time=2353] We're trying to exercise authority with a gentle hand, to be sure, but authority.
[time=2358] That's what God wants us to do.
[time=2360] This is a mantle of responsibility, not something that we carry around, like do what I say.
[time=2365] That will be clear next week, I think.
[time=2368] To behave it over to Satan in verse 20 is to be put outside the church and to be exposed.
[time=2373] Think about that.
[time=2374] Again, a culture is going the opposite direction.
[time=2378] You guys, under the age of 20 down here, especially.
[time=2380] The church has problems.
[time=2383] People often say it's full of hypocrites.
[time=2387] And I said, "That's true." And so is the bank.
[time=2390] And so is the grocery store.
[time=2392] And so is your school.
[time=2393] We still go to the bank and the grocery store.
[time=2396] And we still go to school.
[time=2397] There are hypocrites everywhere.
[time=2399] Guys, the Bible doesn't give any indication to any of us
[time=2405] that church is passé.
[time=2406] That's old fashioned.
[time=2409] The church is 21st century and it needs you really, really badly.
[time=2413] Really badly.
[time=2415] Despite its problems, maybe because of its problems, I don't know.
[time=2420] To be outside the church is to be handed over to Satan.
[time=2423] We need to be together.
[time=2426] The church is people.
[time=2427] It's not a place.
[time=2428] The church is people.
[time=2429] To be in this community of people is to have protection.
[time=2433] To be outside of it is to not have protection.
[time=2435] That's a scary thing to say.
[time=2436] But Paul hopes that they learn not to blaspheme.
[time=2439] Blasphemism, like I had a bad day and that, how that comes.
[time=2442] It was a strong pattern of this deceitful, evil speech about God
[time=2449] is what it said.
[time=2449] That word actually means that.
[time=2451] Really scary stuff.
[time=2452] So the discipline is severe.
[time=2454] It's restorative though.
[time=2456] But put up to the church is a big, big deal.
[time=2458] And it should be done only very, very carefully.
[time=2460] Type for two verse one.
[time=2461] Let's move on.
[time=2462] Serving confidently.
[time=2465] We can do it because of all those things.
[time=2467] We can do it together.
[time=2468] Two verse one.
[time=2469] So then, first of all, he says, then, "I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people." First of all then is it's the first thing.
[time=2480] It's of primary importance right away.
[time=2483] Out of chapter one and the two then, in light of this proclamation of the gospel and how serious it is to live together in this right way, I urge then that prayers and supplications be made for all people.
[time=2496] All people there in verse one in the original language means all people.
[time=2501] That we should pray for everyone.
[time=2507] I prayed a lot about this morning and people have joined me in prayer
[time=2513] and I can't tell you how important that is.
[time=2514] I'm so grateful.
[time=2515] I love you guys and I want to tell you the truth.
[time=2518] It's easy for us to not wish those with whom we disagree,
[time=2526] to not wish them well.
[time=2527] Let's a high profile people in the news these days doing bad things and we hope that misfortune will befall them because they've done bad things and I don't like them.
[time=2537] That'll show them.
[time=2538] There's a heart of justice in there somewhere that God I think is honored by in some ways.
[time=2546] But friends, I think we have to be careful.
[time=2549] I do.
[time=2550] It's really hard to be angry with someone that you're praying for.
[time=2554] I think you can do it if you're a really nasty person.
[time=2557] You probably can do it.
[time=2557] But praying for those with whom you disagree,
[time=2563] to restore them, first of all to yourself, to God, all those things together.
[time=2569] That's important.
[time=2570] First of all, he says, above all, especially pray for all people.
[time=2575] Verse two, for kings and all who are in high positions.
[time=2583] Praying for people who are across the aisle politically.
[time=2589] That's not what Facebook does.
[time=2593] Facebook makes it very easy to do the very opposite of that.
[time=2596] I know that you've known people that serve in public office
[time=2602] or those that aspire to do so and flames all kinds of stuff in us.
[time=2607] I have an undergraduate degree in social studies education and a graduate degree in biblical studies.
[time=2612] So God and politics or things get people really fired up.
[time=2616] That's what my training has been.
[time=2617] So I'm in the firestorm a lot.
[time=2618] And I know that you feel strongly about those things and it will just show up in your social media and that's okay.
[time=2625] I hope that before you post it that you can pray, before you post anything.
[time=2631] Arlen is the chair of the elder board.
[time=2634] He prayed for your mayor, for your governor, and for your president this morning.
[time=2638] And I hope that wasn't awkward for you.
[time=2642] It should not be awkward to do what God says ever.
[time=2645] God says to pray for these people.
[time=2649] Let me go farther.
[time=2652] Paul dies in AD 68.
[time=2653] He's writing this letter a few years before that.
[time=2657] He's writing this letter to Timothy in the mid 60s.
[time=2660] He says, "Timothy, I want you to pray for the very people that will soon kill me." Think about that for a minute.
[time=2669] We are living in a rancorous political climate and you all know that as well as I do
[time=2675] and I won't deny it.
[time=2676] It's been that way for a long, long time.
[time=2680] Now we just know more because we are on the internet every hour of the day.
[time=2683] Paul encourages Timothy and his church to pray for the very authorities Nero that will someday kill him, not in the distant future but in the near future.
[time=2693] So friends, we aren't facing that in this country, not yet.
[time=2699] God is faithful.
[time=2701] God knows what he's doing.
[time=2703] God puts kings in positions and removes them.
[time=2706] He's always been doing that.
[time=2708] He's been doing it for thousands of years.
[time=2709] He's going to keep doing it.
[time=2710] We can trust him.
[time=2712] Paul knew what he was facing.
[time=2714] He wasn't telling Timothy, "Yeah, things are going well, so pray for that king that we like a lot." So pray for Nero, the guy who legend says played his fiddle while the city of Rome
[time=2724] was burning to the ground and blaming it on Christians.
[time=2725] Pray for that guy.
[time=2726] So friends, I, whatever we're facing, it's well short of that right now at least.
[time=2737] What is our excuse for our prayerlessness, our criticism, our cynicism for those that serve us?
[time=2743] I just want to encourage you.
[time=2746] I want to afflict you if you're comfortable and comfort you if you're afflicted in that way.
[time=2750] Social media can be a cancer especially if it gets in the way of what God has said.
[time=2756] If it makes it hard to obey God then stop doing it.
[time=2758] Please, please.
[time=2761] I say it because I love you not because I'm trying to scold you.
[time=2764] I'd love you and I want you to do what God says and to honor him.
[time=2768] Pray for all people.
[time=2771] All people.
[time=2773] These prayers, verse two, into verse three, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life
[time=2783] godly and dignified in every way.
[time=2785] If you don't do this, if you don't pray for all people, for kings and those in high
[time=2792] places of authority, then your life somehow a peaceful, quiet, godly dignified life will be
[time=2801] threatened.
[time=2802] If you don't do it, is that really that surprising?
[time=2806] Haven't we seen that a lot?
[time=2807] When we're critical and when we're cynical about things that these things are all threatened,
[time=2813] I am not saying you shouldn't have opinions because you should or that you shouldn't be involved in politics because you should. I'm saying that these things are in place and I'm not talking about snarky prayers like God make him make him more like me or bring him more to my side of the aisle.
[time=2828] But for him or for her, that's hard. It's easy to be cynical. It's politics for goodness' sakes.
[time=2835] It's easy to be cynical. It always has been easy to do that.
[time=2838] I'm saying from God's word with you this morning that if we don't do those things,
[time=2844] if we aren't prayerful people for our leaders, that somehow those things will elude us and I don't
[time=2850] want that for you. I want a peaceful, quiet, godly, dignified life for you in every way,
[time=2856] so pray for your leaders. Those that you disagree with especially, please. This, verse 3, is good.
[time=2865] It's good. It's pleasing. It's welcome is what that word means. It's welcome in God's sight.
[time=2872] I am. This is not something I'm encouraging to do. It's something different from what God's word says.
[time=2876] Quite the contrary. There is a truth and a knowledge of that truth which God desires all
[time=2884] people to be in alignment with, especially those that serve us in public service, especially those people. And so number two in your outline is to pray earnestly. Serve confidently,
[time=2897] pray earnestly. Please come back tonight at six o'clock and pray with us. Please, please, please.
[time=2903] Maybe we have to pray and let it how your team did today. I don't know, but you'll just come back and pray for whatever reason. Come back and pray. That's supposed to be funny. It wasn't funny.
[time=2912] Okay. Jeremiah 29 says this, "The exiles living in Babylon are prophesied to you by Jeremiah,
[time=2920] who is called the weeping prophet because Jeremiah was..." This is a great talk about prophecy.
[time=2924] It's truth. It's hard truth is what prophecy generally is in the Bible. Not always, but generally.
[time=2932] And so he says this to the exiles living in Babylon. He says, "Pray for the welfare of the city of Babylon, of Babylon, that so you will find your welfare." This is not a new doctrine. Matthew 6,
[time=2949] the Lord's prayer is really the disciples' phrase. It says, "When you pray, pray this way, pray confidently that God knows what he is doing." Ephesians 6, verse 18 through 20,
[time=2961] "Praying at all times in the Spirit with all prayer and supplication." This is Paul's letter
[time=2968] to the church where Timothy is ministering. "To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints. Also for me, that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel." I can't tell you how encouraging it is to know that you're praying for us. I'll say it again. I have to keep saying it. "For which I'm an ambassador in chains that I may declare it boldly as I ought to speak." Paul is encouraging Timothy to follow his example. He follows Christ. Look at verse 4. Verse 3 says, "This is good,
[time=3002] pleasing instead of God our Savior." Verse 4, "God desires all people to be saved
[time=3008] and come to the knowledge of the truth." And that is good to know. That's what God is like.
[time=3014] That's what we should be like too. All people, Republicans and Democrats and all people to be saved.
[time=3022] Ezekiel 18 says that God takes no delight in the death of the wicked.
[time=3027] Matthew 23, Jesus cries out to Jerusalem and says, "I wish you would have let me gather you in like
[time=3036] a hen gathering her chicks, but you wouldn't have it. You didn't recognize the time I was here.
[time=3039] I've longed to do it. Of course, Jerusalem didn't let him gather them at that time."
[time=3045] Second Peter 3, "Guys that went into any should perish." This is the heart of God. Some will perish.
[time=3053] That's obvious from the New Testament. Some will perish tragically. But it is the heart
[time=3059] of God that all should come to this knowledge. I don't know how that will work out. God does.
[time=3064] So everybody gets the gospel. Everyone gets it. That's the application, friends.
[time=3068] You don't know who the elect is. God does. So give the gospel to all people and he will give
[time=3074] them ears to hear or he won't. But his heart is that all people will come to that knowledge of the truth. And there is a truth to be known. Amen? Are you guys out there? We sang it this
[time=3084] morning many, many times. He is the Messiah. He's the Lord of all. And that's a message that the
[time=3091] world needs to hear. That's not fashionable though. To say there's one way to believe or to act or to behave or to conduct your family. Not fashionable. It doesn't make it less true.
[time=3102] Do we share the heart of God that our wicked enemies would not perish?
[time=3110] John 3 says that's why he came into the world, that people would be saved. That's to condemn
[time=3116] the world, but the world would be saved through him. So friends, I just want to encourage you on
[time=3122] that front. I want to encourage you that when we take some kind of pleasure in our wicked enemies
[time=3128] losing the game, that in that way sometimes we unplug from the heart of God. And I think we want,
[time=3136] I want better for me and for my family and for you. Agree with God about your enemies.
[time=3142] About those that we termed the wicked and who God terms the wicked because they are.
[time=3146] We don't know what happens. He does and so we pray earnestly. We serve confidently in community.
[time=3154] God knows what he's doing. We pray earnestly because he wants us to pray. He's commanding us to pray. I urge you then to pray for all people. For those that serve you in public office,
[time=3165] pray for them. If Paul can pray for Nero, you can pray forever, forever is your Nero. You can do it.
[time=3172] He did it. You can do it too. I know you don't want to, but God wants you to.
[time=3176] All right. Verse five, we'll end here today. I get to come back next week and finish these
[time=3186] thoughts. I'm grateful for that. Verse five, there is one God. And there is one mediator
[time=3194] between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. We can pray earnestly because God has entered our
[time=3203] experience and our brokenness and our frailty in a person and he has a name and his name is Jesus.
[time=3209] And that word mediator is a word maybe you don't use a lot, but the word means that there is this
[time=3216] disagreement or there is a barrier that must be taken away or removed and only he could do it.
[time=3224] It had to be done in a certain way by a certain person and it was done in exactly the right way by exactly the right person at exactly the right time. And that's good news. That's really good.
[time=3234] That's why it says in verse six, it was the proper time. The proper time. Let me read with you
[time=3241] verse, 1 Corinthians chapter one starting in verse four. This is so good.
[time=3249] I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ
[time=3256] Jesus that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and knowledge, even as the
[time=3263] testimony about Christ was confirmed among you that you are not lacking in any gift as you wait
[time=3269] for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ. Watch this friends who will sustain you to the end.
[time=3276] Guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ, God is faithful. By whom you were called into
[time=3283] the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ, our Lord, he will sustain you. He is faithful. So pray,
[time=3289] so serve. And lastly this morning proclaim truthfully. Proclaim truthfully. There is no other way to
[time=3299] be saved but through Jesus Christ. It's not loving to tell someone that's not the case.
[time=3306] I was driving home late last night from somewhere far away and my GPS was bossing me.
[time=3311] Tell me where to go. Don't boss me, GPS. I'll do it. I'll do what I want.
[time=3317] I could have done that and ended up who knows where. Is it bossing the GPS to tell me where to go?
[time=3323] I don't think so. Is it arrogant? East? I'm gonna go east. I'm gonna go west. Forget you.
[time=3331] What? God loves us. We are lost. He wants us to be found and he's made away so we can reject that way.
[time=3341] Tragically we can reject it. But it's not loving for God to act like the provision for salvation
[time=3348] hasn't been made perfectly and uniquely in Jesus. That's not loving. That would be cruel.
[time=3353] And cruel for us to act like there were many other ways. That's not what the Bible says.
[time=3361] Friends this morning I encourage you, we'll finish next week, but I encourage you this morning
[time=3369] on this front, three things. Serve confidently. People often think in big churches that, well,
[time=3378] they don't need me. They got enough going on. I can assure you that's not the case.
[time=3382] We need you. We need each other. Every single day we are laboring faithfully to try to serve you
[time=3390] in this place with trembling in our hearts, but we're trying to do it by the grace of God.
[time=3396] And because God has said remarkable things about who you are in light of who Jesus is,
[time=3402] you can serve too. Whatever way it looks like, surf faithfully, confidently. Second thing, pray
[time=3409] earnestly. Pray that God would intervene in all the things that make you worry or fret. I know that you're worried about your kids or about your job or about whatever it is. And the best thing
[time=3423] you can possibly do is to pray all the time, all kinds of prayer, supplications and thanksgivings
[time=3430] and all of it. Pray, pray, pray, pray all the time without ceasing, Paul will say somewhere else.
[time=3436] And lastly, proclaim truthfully, Paul says to Timothy, I've charged you with this one true gospel,
[time=3444] Timothy. There is one God. There is one mediator between that God and men and he is a name and his name is Jesus. And we can gather this morning and sing together and hear from his word and rejoice
[time=3456] that while we were weak at just the right time Christ died for the ungodly. That's good news.
[time=3463] It's not good advice. It's not military advisors. It's heralds. Paul calls himself a herald in verse
[time=3469] seven, a preacher. Preacher is a herald. That's what I am. There's good news. God has made a way
[time=3476] when there was no way he has made that way for you today. Whoever's in the sound of my voice,
[time=3482] it's true. Would you stay with me and I need to pray a benediction over you and we'll be dismissed
[time=3488] this morning. It's good to be together today. Good to be together.
[time=3499] Heavenly Father, I pray for my brothers and sisters within this dream and without that we
[time=3508] would serve confidently in the light of what you have said about us, that we would pray earnestly for all people in season and out of season for all people, for those who are in authorities over
[time=3519] us that we might lead to peaceful and quiet life. Godly dignified in every way and the guy we might proclaim truthfully this morning confidently knowing that you are the one true God and that you have spoken to us and the person of your son and whose name we pray this morning with great thanksgiving. Amen.
