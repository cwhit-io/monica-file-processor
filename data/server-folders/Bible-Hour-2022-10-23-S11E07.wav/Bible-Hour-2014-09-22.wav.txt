[time=188] Today is the day, today is the day, today is the day.
[time=201] Sweet.
[time=202] [AMEN] It's good.
[time=204] Who breaks the power of sin and darkness?

[time=236] This is amazing grace, this is a family love, that you would take my place, that you would
[time=249] bear my cross, you lay down your life that I would be set free.
[time=263] She's assessing for all that you've done for me, here we are.
[time=275] Who brings our chaos back into order, who makes the orphan a son and daughter, the King
[time=284] of Glory, the King above all kings.
[time=289] Who pulls a nation with truth and justice shines like the sun in all of its brilliance, the
[time=300] King of Glory, the King above all kings.
[time=307] This is amazing grace, this is a family love, that you would take my place.
[time=318] That you would bear my cross, you lay down your life that I would be set free.
[time=333] This is amazing grace, this is amazing grace, this is amazing grace, this is amazing grace,
[time=1178] [MUSIC - 13 seconds]
[time=1206] (audience applauding) - We are going through a series in First Timothy, and this morning brings us to the second half of First Timothy chapter two.
[time=1216] That's why we're talking about it this morning.
[time=1219] I'm not sure that I would choose to talk about this passage if it wasn't in the line for us in our series, but God's word is God's word, and I'm grateful for it.
[time=1230] I have approached this morning with a great deal of faith and with fear and trembling, working out my salvation.
[time=1237] I want to read a couple of things with you this morning as we start, but in your bulletins, there is an outline, which you're welcome to follow along with if you would like to, if not, that's okay.
[time=1247] Here's the main idea this morning in First Timothy chapter two.
[time=1252] First Timothy chapters one, two, and three, we think are a very traceable flow of thought for the man who wrote it.
[time=1261] For Paul, we can kind of watch what he's thinking about as these verses unpack, and I hope that it is now Josh and Jesse and myself and my brother Rick next week.
[time=1271] We are very much together on these things.
[time=1274] I pray that you'll see that as we unpack the word of God with you day by day, this flow of thought.
[time=1281] But the main idea here is this.
[time=1283] You can write it in.
[time=1284] How we worship impacts our witness in the world.
[time=1290] What we just sang is what we are commissioned to tell that everybody in our sphere of influence, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, that there is no, it is possible to have no guilt in life and no fear in death.
[time=1307] That is possible.
[time=1308] That is an extraordinary thing to give your life to.
[time=1311] To proclaim that message that there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.
[time=1318] He gave himself as a ransom for all.
[time=1322] That is worth my life.
[time=1324] That is worth the breath that I take to speak that message.
[time=1329] And what Paul is saying is that the way that things are ordered in the church impacts the ability of that church to witness.
[time=1338] And that's the context of the larger scene.
[time=1341] And this morning before we jump into the text itself, I wanted to just paint a picture for you, this long beautiful tapestry in scripture.
[time=1349] And hopefully find first Timothy two, somewhere in among this great field of stars.
[time=1356] About what the Bible says, specifically about women and about their role in the kingdom of God in the church.
[time=1364] Couple of things to share with you as we start.
[time=1366] The first is a quote from William Barkley that I found very encouraging today.
[time=1371] And before I read it, I just want to say this.
[time=1375] Can anyone among us really say or think that what happens in the home is less important than what happens at work?
[time=1386] I don't think anybody among us can say that with a straight face.
[time=1392] That what happens at home doesn't really matter the real business happens at work.
[time=1396] I don't think so, friends.
[time=1399] William Barkley, the humblest and the most unseen activity in the world can be the true worship of God.
[time=1406] Work and worship literally become one.
[time=1410] Man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.
[time=1415] And man carries out that function when he does what God sent him into the world to do.
[time=1422] Work well done rises like a hymn of praise to eternal God.
[time=1427] This means the doctor on his rounds, you guys still make rounds, doctors, I don't know if you do, but doctor on his rounds, the scientist in her laboratory, the teacher in his classroom, the musician at her music, the artist at his canvas, the shop assistant at his counter, the typist at her typewriter, the housewife in her kitchen, all who are doing the work of the world as it should be done are joining in a great act of worship.
[time=1456] Nobody can really say that any of those things doesn't really matter that there are first class citizens in God's kingdom and there are second class citizens in God's kingdom that is not available to us.
[time=1469] We cannot use the Bible to do that.
[time=1471] And I will demonstrate that with you over the course of the next few minutes.
[time=1476] I'll just take a minute and lay this out here before you.
[time=1478] This is just a brief summary of the role of women in the ministry of Jesus.
[time=1483] So if any one of these things were true, it would be something but there's many more I won't read with you today, but just a few to consider.
[time=1490] What does the Bible allow us to say about the role of women in God's kingdom?
[time=1497] Well, here's a quick picture, okay?
[time=1499] Elizabeth and Mary, not Zacharias and Joseph, were the first to receive the news of the coming Messiah.
[time=1505] The prophetess Anna helped pave the way for the coming of the Messiah, preparing those who were waiting for his arrival.
[time=1513] Jesus came into the world through the womb of a woman.
[time=1518] For this reason, Mary, the mother of Jesus is among the most beloved, honored, respected women who ever lived.
[time=1524] It was unheard of for women to be listed in a Jewish genealogy and there they are.
[time=1530] Gentile women at that, prostitutes even, among them.
[time=1534] Jesus introduced to Israel by John the Baptist as the bridegroom.
[time=1540] So God chose a woman, a bride, to depict that which Jesus came to the earth to die for.
[time=1549] Wow.
[time=1550] He spoke to a Samaritan woman in public and told her some of the most amazing things God said about anyone.
[time=1557] The disciples were shocked.
[time=1558] He led an unclean woman to touch him in Mark's gospel.
[time=1561] The defense attorney and a woman called the act of adultery.
[time=1563] Again and again and again and again and again.
[time=1565] These are not like anecdotal things, friends.
[time=1567] These are everywhere in the gospels.
[time=1569] And you see them shine out.
[time=1571] Women did not have a voice in that society.
[time=1574] The first witnesses to his resurrection were women.
[time=1578] Their testimony could not be used at trial because they were women.
[time=1582] And there they are in the gospels.
[time=1583] Who would make up that kind of a story as a Jewish man living in the first century?
[time=1588] Nobody would make that up.
[time=1589] But there they were.
[time=1590] At his death, where were the disciples scattered to the winds?
[time=1595] But for a couple and there are the women at the tomb, at the cross, right?
[time=1602] These are not like anecdotal things but there's more.
[time=1605] This is a quote from John Foster about the New Testament and the balance of it.
[time=1611] Again, this is a field of stars about women in the Testament.
[time=1613] What the Bible does not say.
[time=1615] The church in Caesarea centers upon Philip the evangelist.
[time=1620] This man, Philip, had four daughters, virgins which prophesied.
[time=1625] The church in Japa depends on Tabitha, a woman full of good works and alms deeds which she did.
[time=1631] Follow St. Paul around the Mediterranean.
[time=1633] He crosses to Europe because he dreams of a man from Macedonia who cries, "Come over and help us." But when he lands at Philippi, it's not a man, but a woman.
[time=1643] Lydia was baptized in her household.
[time=1645] His first convert in Europe, a woman everywhere.
[time=1649] Women are the most notable of the converts, often the only ones who believe.
[time=1653] In Thessalonica, there are of the chief women, not a few.
[time=1657] In Berea, Greek women of honorable estate, in Athens, only two names, one of them.
[time=1662] Damorous, a woman.
[time=1663] At Corinth, Priscilla and DiQuilla come into the story.
[time=1666] They're always mentioned together.
[time=1668] And four times out of the six times, the wife's name first unheard of in the first century.
[time=1674] Priscilla was the hostess of the church in her houses at Corinth, Ephesus and Rome.
[time=1679] She was an intimate of the greatest missionary of all, St. Paul.
[time=1682] Six times in the letters of Paul and others, greetings are sent to a house church.
[time=1687] And in five cases, the church is linked with a woman's name.
[time=1691] So this is the vast, new testament, merely New Testament,
[time=1697] much more I could say, field of what the Bible says about women and we must never use the Bible to minimize the role of women in the church.
[time=1708] But it's not what this passage is doing.
[time=1709] You'll see in a minute as you read it.
[time=1711] There are roles for us to play friends.
[time=1713] We are the same men and women, but we are not the same at the same time.
[time=1718] We all stand in need of the grace and mercy of God.
[time=1720] Every one of us, male and female.
[time=1724] But in the light of that, there are different roles for us to play and that's okay.
[time=1729] We believe in this place that that's what God's word is saying.
[time=1732] And everything that we say this morning is motivated by a desire to be faithful to what God's word says, period.
[time=1738] Not to minimize the role of women or to subjugate them or hold them down, that is not the church's business.
[time=1744] And we're not gonna be about that in this place.
[time=1747] We wanna do what God says.
[time=1748] We wanna honor what his word says.
[time=1751] In Hebrews 11, it says, "By faith, by faith, by faith." And all these heroes of the faith and guess who's in there?
[time=1756] Sarah's in there, guess who's in there.
[time=1758] Rahab is in there.
[time=1760] So the Bible doesn't let us do that.
[time=1763] We are motivated this morning by a desire to be faithful to the word of God.
[time=1767] That's why we're here.
[time=1769] That's what we're saying before you week by week.
[time=1772] Let's read our passage for the tour today.
[time=1773] It's the second half of 1 Timothy 2.
[time=1775] I wanna jump in actually to verse five, if I could.
[time=1779] And I might ask you to stand please as we read God's word together.
[time=1782] For Timothy 2 starting in verse five, all the way through verse 15.
[time=1787] For there is one God and there is one mediator between God and men, the man, Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time.
[time=1799] For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle.
[time=1802] I am telling the truth.
[time=1803] I am not lying, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth, verse eight.
[time=1808] I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling.
[time=1815] Likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire, but with what is proper for women who profess godliness with good works.
[time=1828] But a woman learned quietly with all submissiveness.
[time=1831] I do not permit a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man.
[time=1834] Rather she used to remain quiet.
[time=1836] For Adam was formed first, then Eve and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.
[time=1843] Yet she will be saved through childbearing.
[time=1845] If they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control, this is the word of God.
[time=1852] Let's pray.
[time=1853] Father, it is obvious to my friends this morning
[time=1860] that this passage requires that we pray, all passages do, but God, we want to be faithful to your word this morning.
[time=1866] That must be our motivation.
[time=1868] So God, give us ears to hear.
[time=1872] God, rid me of myself.
[time=1874] I pray that what is said this morning would honor you, pray that what is not said this morning would honor you as well.
[time=1880] And God, may we be lifted up men and women together to understand perhaps better what it is that you would have for us today.
[time=1887] Thank you, Heavenly Father, for your faithfulness to us, that when we are faithless, you remain faithful.
[time=1895] Thank you that you are going to take care of us and that we can rest in that truth this morning.
[time=1899] God, in the way we conduct ourselves as a church matters.
[time=1903] So may we do it, God, in accordance with what your word says.
[time=1907] That is my prayer in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1910] You may be seated.
[time=1915] I know of no godly man in this church or any other church that would be effective were it not for the support and love of their wives.
[time=1924] You have heard me say from this pulpit many, many times, today, add to the list, that I'll be curled up in a corner somewhere if it wasn't for my wife, Jodi.
[time=1931] I could not imagine, I don't want to imagine, doing life without her.
[time=1937] So we need each other, desperately need each other.
[time=1942] And because our roles are different in the church does not mean that one is more important than the other.
[time=1947] We must not believe that.
[time=1950] Men, do you honestly believe that the women to whom you entrust your children are lesser servants than those who teach in the gathering?
[time=1957] Do you honestly believe that?
[time=1959] You can't believe that.
[time=1960] What more sacred trust than your children?
[time=1963] And the Bible is clear that this command of silence isn't all absolute, that women are to teach other women and children, and that's a good, precious, and right thing.
[time=1975] In your outlines, three things to say this morning.
[time=1979] And we'll begin with the men, in verse eight.
[time=1981] I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling, number one, men, not angry, prayerful.
[time=1994] This is how we must carry ourselves.
[time=1998] I know, guys, because I'm one of you, my propensity, my tendency to be angry, to quarrel, to power up, and to win, I want to win.
[time=2011] And the Bible says, Paul says to the men
[time=2017] in the church at Ephesus that that must not be near you.
[time=2021] Don't power up, pray.
[time=2025] Prayer is a posture, friends, of powerlessness.
[time=2029] This posture, raising holy hands in prayer, is a posture of humility and powerlessness.
[time=2037] And men, if you expect because our culture is redefining day by day what it means to be a man and a woman, I might say.
[time=2045] What does the Bible say?
[time=2046] The Bible says that men everywhere should pray in every place, pray.
[time=2051] Lift up your hands.
[time=2054] Not hands that are holy 'cause you lost them a certain way, but hands that are holy as a declaration that I want to do what God says, holiness.
[time=2061] Lift up your hands, men, and pray.
[time=2064] Assume a posture of powerlessness and of humility.
[time=2068] The men who lead in this church have said to you publicly and to me privately many, many times.
[time=2076] And they're modeling this in so very many ways, and I'm so glad to tell you that.
[time=2081] I have no hesitancy this morning telling you that I am happily under their leadership because they are doing what God's word says.
[time=2090] And part of that means this, that there are times that they say we don't know what to do, so let's pray.
[time=2095] And everywhere a man wants to be, I've got power, I know what to do, and I have got confidence in that, and they have said, I don't know what to do.
[time=2105] Need to pray.
[time=2106] With my kids, with our kids.
[time=2109] Some of the most powerful times I've had as a parent, I've told you this before, but it bears repeating, that when I say to my kids, you know, I'm sorry for what I said to you, I was angry.
[time=2118] I shouldn't have done that to you.
[time=2120] Or with my wife, honey, I don't know what to do.
[time=2123] Let's talk about it, let's pray together.
[time=2126] The sweetest times in my marriage, and in my time as a father, has been those times when I said, I don't know what to do.
[time=2133] You don't have to have your act together, guys, to be a husband or to be a father.
[time=2139] You just have to be prayerful, day by day by day, and not be angry, and not quarrel, and that need to be right how many corals in my life, because I want to be right.
[time=2150] I want to win, I want to win the fight, I want to win the argument, I want to power up.
[time=2156] No, this is being modeled before you with regularity, and I am so grateful for that.
[time=2163] What a comfort to know that this is happening.
[time=2167] Look at Psalm 63 with me this morning, this has been, the Psalms are this constant source of comfort and rest for me.
[time=2176] If you're looking for someone to jump into the scriptures, friends, if you're struggling.
[time=2179] And the songs that we sing this morning, there's nobody who's unwanted.
[time=2186] If you're unwanted, if you're hurting, if you're broken.
[time=2189] Hallelujah, God's word is for you.
[time=2192] God's word is for you.
[time=2194] Psalm 63, oh God, you are my God.
[time=2197] Earnestly I seek you.
[time=2200] My soul thirsts for you, my flesh faints for you as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
[time=2208] So I looked upon you in the sanctuary beholding your power and glory because your steadfast love is better than life.
[time=2216] My lips will praise you, I will bless you as long as I live, in your name I will lift up my hands.
[time=2223] This kind of earnest prayer was said before us, last week when Paul says to everyone pray urgently, I urge you to make prayers for all people, for those who lead you, please don't stop praying.
[time=2234] The most important thing you can do for this place and for those who serve in this place, men and women is to pray.
[time=2242] This night we're gonna be meeting again to pray out in the sanctuary.
[time=2247] And I encourage you to come join us.
[time=2250] There'll be a slide that ends the service with the time for that, but come and pray.
[time=2255] I urge you Paul says to make prayers, all kinds of prayers, thanksgivings, supplications, all of it, pray, pray, pray.
[time=2263] Men pray.
[time=2265] What better way for you to lead your family than to assume that posture and say God, I'm trusting you.
[time=2272] With my work, with my role as a husband, as a father, pray men, when your wives watch you pray, when your kids watch you pray, it's powerful.
[time=2285] That's powerful.
[time=2286] When your kids and your wife watch you pray and say, God, I don't know what to do, help me, please.
[time=2291] James 5, my brother Rick will be here next week
[time=2297] talking about elders in the church.
[time=2298] It seems wildly appropriate.
[time=2300] James 513, is anyone among you suffering?
[time=2304] Let him pray.
[time=2305] Is anyone cheerful that I'm seeing praise?
[time=2308] Maybe you're in those two places today.
[time=2309] Suffering, cheerful, I don't know, here's a response.
[time=2312] Is anyone among you sick?
[time=2314] Let him cough the elders of the church and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord, and the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up.
[time=2324] Not the magical prayers of men, but the Lord.
[time=2327] He face committed sins, he'll be forgiven.
[time=2330] Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed.
[time=2334] The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.
[time=2340] For example, Elijah was a man with a nature like ours.
[time=2342] He was a regular person, he wasn't Superman.
[time=2345] He prayed fervently that it might not rain and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth and he prayed again and heaven gave rain and the earth bore its fruit.
[time=2354] Everywhere the New Testament assumes there are going to be elders in a local church given to headship, given to leading.
[time=2362] And those elders are, one of their responsibilities in James 5 is to pray.
[time=2366] So you can't escape this, it's everywhere we go.
[time=2371] This is a passage from 1 Peter 3 that's given a great encouragement to me also during the week.
[time=2376] And by the way, let me pause here for a minute.
[time=2378] I've been here for a few years, serving you faithfully.
[time=2382] And I'm just so grateful to do it.
[time=2383] And then the outlines that I give you regularly, there's lots of verses in there besides our text.
[time=2387] This is why I do that in case you don't know.
[time=2390] I believe the best way to interpret the Bible is with the Bible.
[time=2394] And I want to be careful to take a passage from 1 Timothy 2 and say how does this fit into all that God has said?
[time=2400] I can't do that very well in half an hour, but I can try.
[time=2403] And so that's why I give you all kinds of other places to go in scripture that talk about these things so we can understand it better with the wide angle, okay?
[time=2411] That's why.
[time=2412] I know there's things to say in this passage, and I'll get there, but that's the reason why we do that.
[time=2417] To show you all that God has said throughout his word.
[time=2420] What did you know that?
[time=2422] To rightly divide what God's word has said.
[time=2426] This is 1 Peter 3, and this has a lot to do with our own passage watch.
[time=2431] Wives, likewise verse one.
[time=2433] Wives be subject to your own husbands, to your own.
[time=2437] That's somebody else's, but to yours.
[time=2439] But even if some do not obey the word, they may be one without a word by the conduct of your, of their wives.
[time=2446] When they see your respectful and pure conduct, do not let your adorning be external.
[time=2452] The braiding of hair and the putting out of gold jewelry or the clothing you wear.
[time=2456] Let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit.
[time=2463] Which in God's sight is very precious.
[time=2467] For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves by submitting to their own husbands as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling them Lord.
[time=2476] You are her children if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening.
[time=2480] Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way showing honor.
[time=2488] Showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel.
[time=2491] Since they are heirs with you of the grace of life that your prayers may not be hindered.
[time=2499] So just like if you don't pray for our president, our governor, our mayor, congressmen and women.
[time=2506] If you don't pray for them, it says in some way, in this passage that your life, a peaceful and quiet and godly and dignified life is threatened.
[time=2516] It also says that husbands, if they don't honor their wives and treat them with respect, their prayers might be hindered.
[time=2522] That's a warning, I'm taking it seriously.
[time=2524] Don't miss the importance of these verses for our passage, pray, honor your wife husbands.
[time=2531] They are heirs with you.
[time=2533] Co-heirs, men and women, the same.
[time=2536] Verse nine, first Timothy two.
[time=2540] Likewise, also that women should adorn themselves
[time=2546] in respectable apparel with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire.
[time=2553] Respectable apparel here is proper clothing, maybe yours says.
[time=2556] It says appropriate clothing.
[time=2558] It says suitable apparel.
[time=2560] We are so much more than the clothes we wear.
[time=2564] I'll repeat that.
[time=2567] We are so much more than the clothes that we wear.
[time=2572] This is not a prohibition, friends, on wearing nice things or even on looking good.
[time=2577] The key is motivation.
[time=2579] Why do I wear what I wear?
[time=2581] I don't get to do whatever I want when I put clothes on.
[time=2586] I don't, none of us do.
[time=2588] We're bought with a price.
[time=2590] Glorify God with your body and with what you wear, okay?
[time=2595] In the first century, the things that Paul describes were connected with worldliness, these things, right?
[time=2602] Braided hair, gold pearls, costly attire were often synonymous with immorality.
[time=2606] And Paul says, don't do that.
[time=2607] Don't ruin your witness in that way.
[time=2609] This is not a prohibition for you, women, to not braid your hair or wear gold jewelry or any of those things because then it was attached to those things.
[time=2617] Later on, these things are not bound by culture 'cause Paul ties them with creation and created order.
[time=2623] But these things live like head coverings do in the first century.
[time=2627] Women, if you want to voluntarily not wear gold jewelry, that's fine or pearls or braids your hair.
[time=2633] Those are fine things, but there is no universal prohibition for those things here.
[time=2637] Rest in the fact that God loves you.
[time=2640] You don't have to show him anything or prove yourself to him.
[time=2644] I was in the supermarket with my 11 year old daughter recently and there he wore it at the checkout counter and there's a rack of magazines and all these beautiful Photoshop women.
[time=2661] How should you look, honey?
[time=2663] How should you conduct yourself?
[time=2665] I don't know what she was thinking.
[time=2667] So I shuffled her off and got her close to me so she wouldn't be looking at that, you know?
[time=2672] Why do you wear what you wear, ladies?
[time=2677] I can't speak for you.
[time=2679] You are beroged day by day with this almost endless stream of you have to look this way and you have to be this way and you have to make him look at you in a certain way.
[time=2690] And the Bible says, no you don't.
[time=2692] The imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit.
[time=2697] I cannot tell you the blessing it is to be married to a wife who happens to be beautiful, but she's beautiful because she has that.
[time=2705] And young men, unmarried men in the room and send to my voice, find a woman like that and hold her close and honor her and respect her and never let her go.
[time=2715] Don't love things and use people.
[time=2720] Love people and use things.
[time=2723] We have to wear clothes.
[time=2725] When you, what motivates me to dress the way that I dress?
[time=2728] Do you have other people in mind or yourself?
[time=2730] That's a general principle at view, in view here.
[time=2733] Look at verse 10.
[time=2734] But with what is proper for women who profess godliness with good works, I love the new living translation of this verse, here's how it reads, verse 10.
[time=2745] For women who claim to be devoted to God should make themselves attractive by the good things they do.
[time=2751] I love that.
[time=2753] Women who claim to be devoted to God should make themselves attractive by the good things that they do.
[time=2758] What a witness to the world.
[time=2760] What a witness.
[time=2762] My wife, we got a knock on our door this week and my wife ran across the cul-de-sac to introduce the neighbors of ours.
[time=2770] She was there at a time of crisis for them.
[time=2774] That's a witness.
[time=2777] Nobody can deny what you do.
[time=2779] They can deny what you say.
[time=2780] My poor wife has to live with me so she hears everything that I say and then I gotta go home and try to measure up to what I say and it's, that's a tough thing.
[time=2790] But she's gracious and she's good.
[time=2792] How we treat others, how we raise our children, how we do our jobs, good works.
[time=2796] Good works, Proverbs 31.
[time=2801] I would be remiss to not read this passage with you.
[time=2803] Proverbs 31.
[time=2804] I cannot tell you the blessing of having a wife found in these verses.
[time=2809] I cannot tell you.
[time=2811] Strength and dignity are her clothing and she laughs at the time to come.
[time=2817] She opens her mouth with wisdom and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.
[time=2822] She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.
[time=2827] Her children rise up and call her blessed.
[time=2830] Her husband also and he praises her.
[time=2832] Many women have done excellently but you surpass.
[time=2838] [AMEN] Them all.
[time=2845] Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
[time=2852] Give her the fruit of her hands and let her works praise her in the gates.
[time=2856] We are called to love each other.
[time=2859] The world is watching.
[time=2860] How you treat your wives, men, it matters to your witness.
[time=2865] It does.
[time=2866] Women, how you carry yourselves, it matters to your witness.
[time=2869] Number two in your outline is what is truly beautiful.
[time=2872] What is truly beautiful.
[time=2874] The way that we love each other matters, it matters to the world, it matters to God.
[time=2882] Husbands, love your wives, Ephesians 5 says, as Christ loved the church, that's a high calling.
[time=2889] That's a high calling.
[time=2894] These verses 11 and 12, let's look at those together.
[time=2897] Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness.
[time=2899] I do not permit a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, rather she is to remain quiet.
[time=2907] These verses are not a command to absolute silence everywhere.
[time=2911] They are not.
[time=2912] And that's obvious because of what it says elsewhere in the Bible, again, the Bible won't let you do what you want to do sometimes to say this or say that.
[time=2921] 1 Corinthians 11 says, in verse 11, "In the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor man of woman, for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman, all things are from God." There is no New Testament justification to hold women down or reduce them as lesser.
[time=2939] Quite the contrary, I would say, we are not the same.
[time=2944] Men and women are not, that's a news flash, not the same.
[time=2950] In one way, but in the most important ways we are, we all need God's grace and mercy.
[time=2958] We all have a story to tell that the world needs to hear from us and to say that we are different, is that to say that one is here and here.
[time=2966] We are different, we are not the same and that's okay.
[time=2969] That's good.
[time=2970] It's a good thing.
[time=2971] We have different roles to play even in the church.
[time=2973] Ephesians 5, 21 says, "Submit to what another out of reverence for Christ." I am so grateful for the women who have spoken into my life and who keep speaking into my life.
[time=2985] In this vast field, guys, this field of stars, this wide tapestry of all that God says about women, there is a point here that we say, we stop and say, oh, okay, what's that about?
[time=2998] In Acts 18, Apollos is a great speaker
[time=3004] and he's talking about all the things that he knows and Priscilla and Aquila, remember them?
[time=3008] They take Apollos aside and say, here's some more stuff you know, Apollos.
[time=3012] So there's no command to not teach.
[time=3014] In Titus 2 it talks about older women teaching younger women and children.
[time=3018] This is a good thing and the Bible supports it.
[time=3022] The Bible supports order in our worship.
[time=3025] Order in the way that we carry ourselves because how we worship impacts our witness in the world.
[time=3031] See how they love each other.
[time=3037] This is why these things, friends, that we in this place are trying to be faithful to what God's word says and while we can't leave it merely in the first century, this is the reason why in verses 13 and following.
[time=3047] For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
[time=3049] In some way Paul roots this stuff back to creation.
[time=3052] Not that Eve is lesser than Adam, but that this is how the order in which it took place.
[time=3056] Or even that verse 14, Adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.
[time=3062] Doesn't mean that men are less prone to sin than women.
[time=3066] If you guys know any men, you know that's not true.
[time=3068] You know any men in the room?
[time=3071] Less prone, yeah, okay.
[time=3073] We are equally prone to sin.
[time=3075] But somehow Paul says that the way that our worship and the way that our church lives are ordered looks like that for that reason.
[time=3083] Not because it was Adam was great.
[time=3086] Where were you, Adam?
[time=3087] When your wife was getting deceived by a serpent, where were you?
[time=3094] No where to be found?
[time=3095] He was passive and his wife plunged into sin and Adam did nothing.
[time=3102] Don't think this is letting men off the hook, quite the contrary.
[time=3106] Look at Genesis 3, again this is the reason why we try to do what God's word says.
[time=3112] Genesis 3, verses 14 and following.
[time=3114] The Lord God said to the serpent, because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field on your belly, you shall go and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
[time=3128] I will put enmity that word means strife.
[time=3131] It means friction between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring.
[time=3137] He shall bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel.
[time=3141] That translation is different than others.
[time=3143] Others say you shall, the son of the woman, Jesus, will crush the head of the serpent, but the serpent will strike his heel.
[time=3152] This is the first mention of the good news of the gospel in the whole Bible, Genesis 3, 15.
[time=3158] The serpent's head will be crushed, but it will come through pain and through suffering.
[time=3164] It's the cross.
[time=3165] To the woman he said, here's our passage.
[time=3168] I will surely multiply your pain and childbearing.
[time=3170] In pain you shall bring forth children, your desire shall be for your husband and he shall rule over you.
[time=3177] To Adam he said, because you listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree which I commanded you, you shall not eat of it.
[time=3186] Curse is the ground because of you, Adam.
[time=3189] In pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life.
[time=3192] Part of this curse, friends, is leading to frustration between men and women.
[time=3197] That's part of the curse, that's what it means.
[time=3200] But did you hear the words of the song?
[time=3203] Since curse has lost its grip on me.
[time=3207] Part three of your outline, this is the final word.
[time=3211] Salvation has the last word.
[time=3213] There will be pain and childbearing, ladies.
[time=3218] Men you will experience futility in your work.
[time=3221] That's not the last word.
[time=3225] The last word is Jesus.
[time=3227] Galatians 4-4 says, when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his son, born of a woman, born of a woman.
[time=3237] He could have showed up as a full grown man.
[time=3241] There he is, ready to go.
[time=3243] Three hours before the crucifixion, that could have happened.
[time=3245] That's not what happened.
[time=3247] Do you hear thinking about that?
[time=3249] Fullness of God and helpless babe.
[time=3251] We're saying that too, didn't we?
[time=3254] Amazing how God does that.
[time=3256] Born of a woman, ladies pain and childbirth is not the final word.
[time=3262] Look at verse 15, yet she will be saved through childbearing if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control.
[time=3270] There are two connected interpretations of this verse.
[time=3274] It's a hard verse to figure out what does that mean?
[time=3277] There are two things I would say that I think are really helpful.
[time=3280] One, she will be saved through childbearing.
[time=3285] Doesn't mean by the means of childbearing because that's not how someone is saved by giving birth.
[time=3290] I'm glad that's the case because I wouldn't be saved, otherwise.
[time=3292] But it means that this pain, this struggle, this suffering doesn't have the final word.
[time=3300] Salvation has the final word.
[time=3301] Save through it, save through.
[time=3305] You can make it through.
[time=3308] The labor, labor doesn't stop, ladies, when you give birth.
[time=3313] Child raising is as painful as childbearing sometimes.
[time=3317] I know that you know that.
[time=3318] That doesn't have the final word.
[time=3320] The final word is salvation.
[time=3326] Men, your work has purpose and meaning and value because of what Christ has done.
[time=3332] Doesn't have the final word.
[time=3333] The curse has lost its grip because of what Christ has done.
[time=3336] Tied to that, saved through childbearing.
[time=3341] When the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his son, born of a woman.
[time=3348] We are all saved through the bearing of that child.
[time=3352] Because that child was born, we can all be saved.
[time=3356] That's what God desires, all men to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth.
[time=3360] I don't know which one of those things Paul's saying, but I think it probably is both in some ways.
[time=3364] She'll be saved through childbearing if she continues in faith and love and holiness with self-control.
[time=3371] The demonstration of your real authentic faith, ladies, is a great witness to the world.
[time=3376] There is one meter between God and man.
[time=3379] The man Christ Jesus.
[time=3381] We are not the same.
[time=3385] Men, women, we're not the same, but we're equals.
[time=3388] Joint heirs with Jesus.
[time=3392] Joint heirs, we have different roles to play, different spheres of influence, not one lesser than the other.
[time=3400] The Bible won't let you do that.
[time=3403] And women, we live in a culture violent to women, famously, tragically.
[time=3408] And we cannot, we must not use the Bible to justify anything remotely close to that.
[time=3416] The Bible's view is to esteem women at unprecedented levels,
[time=3422] including this passage.
[time=3424] I praise God for that.
[time=3427] Let me close with a quote from John Piper on this issue that I found really helpful.
[time=3432] And I'll pray.
[time=3433] For men and women who have a heart to minister, to save souls and heal broken lives and resist evil and meet needs, there are fields of opportunity that are endless.
[time=3444] God intends for the entire church to be mobilized in ministry, male and female.
[time=3451] Listen, nobody is to simply stay at home watching soaps and ball games while the world burns.
[time=3458] That's a good takeaway.
[time=3461] Men, don't be angry, be prayerful.
[time=3464] Ladies, rest in what God says is truly beautiful and that's available to you.
[time=3470] Remember, each one of us, men and women that salvation has the final word.
[time=3475] Let's stay and pray together as we leave this morning.
[time=3479] Would you pray with me?
[time=3485] Father God, I'm so grateful for today and for your word, what it says, Lord, we are trying to be obedient to your word in this place and we do it with trembling and with fear and with humility, but we're trying.
[time=3496] Thank you for the men who are leading in this church faithfully and thank you for the women who stand behind them every step of the way.
[time=3505] I cannot tell you what a blessing that is, God.
[time=3508] Thank you for Jesse and for Josh who have taught before me and for Rick who will follow after God.
[time=3514] Please be with him this week as he gets ready for next week telling us about elders.
[time=3518] Thank you for this church.
[time=3520] God, tonight we're gonna gather to pray and pray that as we pray that you would be made much of in that.
[time=3529] I offer this prayer to you, Father, rejoicing in your goodness and all these things in Jesus' name.
[time=3536] [AMEN]
