[time=229] Well, good morning, everyone.
[time=231] And welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=232] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=234] I've been serving as a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries for several years.
[time=238] And I'm still grateful and still very humbled to be part of the team here, earnestly and diligently serving in our community to make much of Christ to help people as we strive to present every person complete in Christ.
[time=252] That's our mission.
[time=253] That's what we're after.
[time=255] And we've never been more committed to that mission than we are today.
[time=261] We're so grateful that you're watching.
[time=263] We say that often, but I want to say it again this morning, you are a part of our church family.
[time=269] The Bible Hour has been operating on all cylinders for over 30 years.
[time=274] And some of you have been watching for a very, very long time.
[time=276] And we wanted to encourage you this morning by just thanking you for watching, for being a part of our church family.
[time=283] Fort Wayne is a wonderful place to live in the surrounding area.
[time=287] It gets a chance to kind of watch or look into our services on Sunday morning, and we're just so glad that you are.
[time=293] Would you please encourage us by reaching out to us and letting us know that you're watching how the Bible Hour has been an encouragement to you.
[time=301] It means so much to us to know that you're watching.
[time=304] So right into us, go to our church website.
[time=306] There's information there about how you can contact us.
[time=309] You can follow us on Twitter or on Facebook.
[time=313] All the information about that will be on the screen before me this morning.
[time=319] We are, as you know, in a season of transition here at Blackhawk.
[time=323] And it felt appropriate for us in that season of transition to really focus on how it is the church should operate.
[time=331] How should the church function?
[time=333] What are some things that we should be talking about as we have an opportunity in light of our transition to really get clear on several things?
[time=341] And this morning we find ourselves in 1 Timothy 3 talking about elders and how elders are supposed to function and lead in the church.
[time=349] And I can't think of a better person to have that conversation than my dear friend, Rick Raber, who is one of our elders and who will be preaching this morning on 1 Timothy 3.
[time=359] Rick has walked through with me personally some really difficult seasons in ministry and he's been a very great friend to myself again personally and to my family.
[time=371] So I cannot wait for you to hear from him this morning from 1 Timothy 3.
[time=375] You've seen Rick up front more in recent days.
[time=379] Rick has got a heart, the biggest heart I know.
[time=383] And I'm so grateful that he gets a chance this morning to share that heart with you and you get to hear him teach.
[time=388] He has labored diligently over this message.
[time=391] He's got a passion for it to watch the church be led, be governed, and be shepherded in ways that are faithful to what God's word says.
[time=400] So I can't wait for you to hear from Rick.
[time=402] And again friends, please reach out to us on the internet.
[time=406] Reach out on Facebook or Twitter.
[time=409] Let us know that you're watching.
[time=411] How we've been an encouragement to you.
[time=413] Please know that you are an encouragement to us.
[time=416] So thanks for watching.
[time=446] [MUSIC]
[time=453] Sing that with us right there.
[time=455] [MUSIC]
[time=463] Son of God, son of man, land that was slain.
[time=473] Joy and peace, strength and hope, praise that blows of fear away.
[time=483] Jesus, what a beautiful name.
[time=499] Truth reveal my future seal.
[time=504] Feel my pain.
[time=508] Love and freedom, life and one.
[time=513] Praise that blows of fear away.
[time=518] Jesus, what a beautiful name.
[time=534] He rescued my soul, he's my stronghold, lift me from shame.
[time=543] Forgiveness, security, power and love.
[time=548] Praise that blows of fear away.
[time=553] Jesus, what a beautiful name.
[time=570] Son of God, son of man, land that was slain.
[time=580] Joy and peace, strength and hope.
[time=584] Praise that blows of fear away.
[time=590] Jesus, what a beautiful name.
[time=597] Joy and peace, strength and hope.
[time=602] Praise that blows of fear away.
[time=607] Jesus, what a beautiful name.
[time=617] [AMEN]
[time=624] I have been a part of this place for several years and it's all come to this point.
[time=631] We're going through a series on First Timothy, a call to live it out.
[time=634] And this morning we find ourselves in First Timothy chapter three and a discussion about elders.
[time=639] And there is nobody I know who might choose over this man, Rick Raber, to speak that message over you this morning.
[time=647] So as Rick comes up, I want to pray with him and for him that God will give us ears to hear what his word says.
[time=653] Rick has been a dear friend to me over the years.
[time=657] I can think of no one again that I've co-labored with in Christ.
[time=661] It's been sweeter than with this man.
[time=663] So I'm so grateful for his family, for his example of all the things that he's going to talk about from First Timothy.
[time=669] I know he wouldn't say that himself, so I'll say it for him.
[time=671] That Rick embodies those things as he leads his family, as he humbly serves in this place.
[time=677] So I want to pray with him, would you pray with me as you begin this morning?
[time=683] Heavenly Father, thank you that you have given us your word as a demonstration of your love
[time=692] for us.
[time=694] God, you knew that we would gather together.
[time=696] That was your design.
[time=698] And you knew that when we gathered, we would need help and leadership and protection.
[time=704] God, so even the fact that you have listed out for us in your word in many places, what those leaders should be like is a demonstration of grace.
[time=713] Grace that blows all fear away.
[time=717] We thank you, God, that we are gathered this morning in the beautiful name of Jesus, the one who loved us and gave himself for us, the one mediator between God and man.
[time=728] So I pray for my brother, Rick, this morning that you would go before him as you did last hour, that you would give us ears that are ready to hear what your word says.
[time=738] And I thank you that in this season of transition that we can really bear down and look at what your word says and how we should operate together.
[time=746] So God, be with Rick, be with us.
[time=748] We pray these things in Jesus' name with great thanksgiving.
[time=751] [AMEN - 2 seconds] Before we actually start into the sermon, I want to acknowledge that the reason, one of the reasons that I can stand up here
[time=768] is what's modeled in 2 Timothy, actually, chapter 1.
[time=772] If you flip to that real quickly, 2 Timothy, chapter 1, Paul is talking to Timothy and he says,
[time=780] "I have been reminded of your certain fear of faith, which first lived in your grandmother
[time=787] and also in your mother, and now I am persuaded, now lives in you also.
[time=791] For this I remind you to fan in the flame the gift of God, which has been given you and laying on it of hands.
[time=797] I did not give us a spirit of timidity, but of power, of love and a sound mind.
[time=802] The reason I share that with you this morning is because of the influence my mother had on me.
[time=810] Some of you know my mom's sick and she's actually hopefully watching on one of the live streams today from Southern Indiana.
[time=821] Her influence on me during a difficult time and a difficult season and what it means to build faith into the next generation
[time=832] is the reason that I even have confidence enough to stand up here this morning, but I have a mom that even is operating a fear of where her next breath comes from this morning.
[time=850] And so it's with that confidence that she instilled in me and lives by faith today that I want to stand up here and proclaim God's word to you today.
[time=860] It's that blessing that she gave to me and so I'm really thankful for her influence in my life.
[time=871] Today I want to start with a little bit of a tap from our culture.
[time=876] Over the years there has been a whole variety of sitcoms that I hope that you can play this game with me a little bit this morning.
[time=888] Some of these are going to be from a generation a little closer to this section down here.
[time=892] Some of them are going to be a little bit older generation and then some of us will be from the season greyhairs like me
[time=899] when I graduated from high school came from in 1982.
[time=904] What I'm going to ask you to do is I'm going to read you a lyric.
[time=907] I'm going to read you a lyric from a theme song of one of the sitcoms that we're all really familiar with probably.
[time=912] And as soon as you recognize where it's from if you would, if somebody would feel please feel free in the sanctuary to call it out this morning.
[time=920] So we're going to do that.
[time=922] Here's the first one.
[time=925] Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state.
[time=928] Big bang theory.
[time=930] Look at that.
[time=931] They barely got the first lyric out.
[time=933] Let's talk about some of the unique personalities from the big bang theory.
[time=937] Penny, Penny, Leonard, Sheldon, very unique individual.
[time=949] For those people a geek is a term of endearment and I can relate to that one.
[time=955] But they all have a unique personality.
[time=957] But it's a sense of community.
[time=959] Let's go back a little bit further.
[time=962] So no one told you life was going to be this way.
[time=966] Your job's a joke.
[time=967] Your broke.
[time=968] Your life's DOA.
[time=970] Friends.
[time=971] There we go.
[time=972] Friends.
[time=973] The culture of that.
[time=976] Anybody got any personalities from that?
[time=979] Who are some of the personalities from friends?
[time=983] Come on.
[time=984] Yeah.
[time=985] Joel.
[time=986] Rachel.
[time=988] They're unique individuals.
[time=994] Chandler.
[time=995] Ross.
[time=996] Phoebe.
[time=998] Let's go back a little bit further.
[time=1003] Making your way in the world today takes everything you got.
[time=1007] Cheers.
[time=1008] Yeah.
[time=1009] That's a little bit older generation.
[time=1010] I want to read the rest of that lyric for you though.
[time=1013] Making your way in the world today takes everything you got.
[time=1017] Taking a break from all your worries sure would help a lot.
[time=1021] Wouldn't you like to get away?
[time=1023] And sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name.
[time=1028] And they're always glad you came.
[time=1030] Cheers.
[time=1031] You're right.
[time=1032] You want to be where you can see people are all the same.
[time=1037] You want to go where everybody knows your name.
[time=1040] Again from there.
[time=1042] Cliff Clavin.
[time=1043] And Norm.
[time=1046] Sitting at the corner.
[time=1049] There's a whole another show launched off of Frager Crane.
[time=1056] The thing that's unique that I want to submit to you this morning is that knit within every one of those that makes them such a booming success is the desire of that everybody wanting
[time=1067] to go where everybody knows your name.
[time=1069] It's that cheers mentality.
[time=1070] It's that sense of community that everybody wants to know that they belong or they fit.
[time=1078] God created deep within every one of us.
[time=1084] The desire to know and be known by our fellow man to fit and belong.
[time=1090] To go where everybody knows your name but not only knows your name but gets a peek into
[time=1099] all the ugly and still loves you.
[time=1105] That's the acceptance that we long for.
[time=1108] The intimacy required in order for those desires to be fulfilled cannot have its foundation
[time=1114] in man.
[time=1115] It can't have its foundation in man.
[time=1117] It has to have its foundation in the person of Jesus Christ and the gospel of his blood for you.
[time=1123] It's that freedom that gives us the liberty to be laid bare before our fellow men and to
[time=1131] live in a way that's accepted.
[time=1135] It's that sense of community.
[time=1137] It's out of that relationship with Jesus that we are able to know and truly be known by other people.
[time=1145] But if you haven't experienced that freedom then there's difficulty and there's barriers.
[time=1150] Attention arises when we get to the spot that we understand that Jesus is there.
[time=1158] Jesus is there but yet we are here and we like to have somebody Jesus with skin on if you will.
[time=1169] Somebody that you can touch.
[time=1171] Somebody that can encourage you.
[time=1172] Somebody can wrap their arms around you and say I love you.
[time=1175] Somebody that can kick you in the butt when you need to be kicked.
[time=1178] And encourage you and spur you on.
[time=1182] Again, Jesus with skin on.
[time=1185] My human nature in yours like the Israelites calls and wants for a king, a leader, somebody
[time=1193] that we can point to and reach out and touch and look at.
[time=1197] And all of a sudden that's not necessarily what we get.
[time=1201] We get to a spot where we need somebody.
[time=1206] We need somebody we can see and tangible.
[time=1209] Fully aware of our need and nature for a living human example.
[time=1214] God made his provision for those that would love, lead, care for and teach and set the
[time=1223] example for that unconditional love in the body of Christ.
[time=1227] We believe that example is meant to be fulfilled in the role of an elder.
[time=1233] It's meant to be nurtured in that way.
[time=1236] So today we're going to talk about some definitions of that elder person.
[time=1242] What does that look like?
[time=1243] What are some of the meanings that our culture has poured into that?
[time=1247] We're also going to talk about the method that it needs to be more than one guy.
[time=1252] Why does it need to be more than one guy?
[time=1254] We're going to talk about the model of what it means from shepherds and sheep and that's all over the place in the scriptures from that example.
[time=1262] And then we're also going to talk about the makeup of this guy that aspires this man to
[time=1268] become an elder, to be an elder.
[time=1270] Why are they qualifications?
[time=1272] Why are they literally a mandate to meet that?
[time=1276] And then finally we're going to talk about what it means for those that aren't elders, to be followers that do it well.
[time=1284] To be followers that do it well.
[time=1286] So let's jump in.
[time=1287] The elder is termed accompanied by several others, but there's three words that come out to play.
[time=1293] One is the term elder.
[time=1295] The second is that of bishop or overseer.
[time=1298] And the third is that of shepherder pastor.
[time=1301] There's three terms there and we won't get into the Greek words behind them.
[time=1305] But they occur all over the place.
[time=1307] They occur all over the place in the New Testament.
[time=1311] All three are used interchangeably in several passages.
[time=1314] And that's why we believe and we teach here that that is a role, that is synonymous,
[time=1320] and they're used interchangeably.
[time=1321] Flip with me to first Peter 5.
[time=1323] We'll go to that passage right here to start with.
[time=1326] First Peter 5 verses 1 through 4.
[time=1329] I want you to listen for those words or things that sound like that as we read this passage.
[time=1336] To the elders, plural among you, I appeal as a fellow elder and a witness of Christ's
[time=1343] sufferings who also will share in the glory to be revealed.
[time=1348] Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care.
[time=1352] Watching over them, not because you must, but because you are willing as God wants you to be.
[time=1359] Not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve.
[time=1363] Not loarding it over those who entrusted you, but being examples to the flock.
[time=1368] When the chief shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.
[time=1374] Let me highlight those three terms they're all using in the same passage.
[time=1377] The first is elders, a little bit further, it goes on and it says be shepherds, that's the second one.
[time=1384] And the third one is wrapped up in that concept of watching over.
[time=1389] That's that overseer component.
[time=1391] And so we get all three of those, but the truth is all of those are wrapped up into one meaning of an elder.
[time=1397] The guy that's going to lead the church and out of that what that looks like.
[time=1402] As we consider that whole concept, we now have the plurality of it at the same time.
[time=1409] We read it.
[time=1411] Also in Acts chapters, there's several of them.
[time=1415] All the way back through the whole section of Acts, it's really clear that the elders are the authority for leadership in the church.
[time=1423] It's really, really clear.
[time=1425] They set that example, they set the example of what their call is.
[time=1429] And it's also one of those things, the elder term, you don't find it associated with the concept of a king or a priest.
[time=1442] Those two things are things that I believe are really clearly something that God's trying to push us away from.
[time=1449] That we're looking to that individual, we're looking to a man, we're looking to a person to fulfill what God's called the multiplicity of these people to do.
[time=1461] And so when we look at that, overwhelmingly, it's plural in everywhere except for passages when Peter and John.
[time=1470] Another thing that I want to help you with, I understand with, is in all of the translations of these three words all over the New Testament, there's only one.
[time=1480] There's only one that comes up, translated in Ephesians 4 verse 11, that actually uses the word pastor.
[time=1489] Every other place that it happens, it is not used as pastor.
[time=1493] And there it's actually best translated, hyphenated, pastor, teacher.
[time=1499] And our culture is taken and put this title on staff positions and places and people that that pastor serves as a role that clearly by the translation of all of it there, it occurs one time.
[time=1514] And the rest of them are shepherd, overseer, bishop, elder, shepherd, shepherd.
[time=1521] I mean, it's all over the place in the passages.
[time=1525] So as we look at this today, we're going to transition to the first section here.
[time=1528] And the first fill in the blank for you in your outline is God's model, God's method calls for more than one man.
[time=1537] Flip with me to Exodus chapter 18, Exodus chapter 18.
[time=1543] It is a passage where Jethro, this is probably, if you want to talk about mother-in-law, father-in-law situations, this is one of those really, really good ones because Moses had a really good father-in-law that was willing to speak truth to him, and Moses actually listened.
[time=1563] And so let's look at Exodus 18, verse 13.
[time=1571] The next day Moses took his seat to the service judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening.
[time=1577] When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for his people, he said, "What is this that you're doing?
[time=1585] Why do you sit alone as judge?
[time=1587] Why are all these people stand around you from morning till evening?" Moses answered him because people come to me to seek the Lord's will.
[time=1596] Whenever they have the dispute, it's brought to me and I decide between the parties and inform them of God's decrees and instructions.
[time=1604] Moses' father-in-law replied, "What you are doing is not good."
[time=1610] And we go to the next slide and what we get is a break right here.
[time=1614] Why in the world, when Moses is in the middle of ministry, would he have a father-in-law say, "What you're doing isn't a good thing.
[time=1627] Why would that be something that he brings to bear to the body?" And I would submit to you that part of it has to do with what happens like when you go to see a doctor and you have to wait.
[time=1641] And you don't quite get in at the time.
[time=1644] And you happen to be the guy that was standing in line for Moses and it got dark and it got time to go home and you didn't get to see Moses.
[time=1654] Again, what does that look like?
[time=1656] It really is one of those things that we have to consider.
[time=1660] When we go to the next verse, it's pretty clear, Moses was doing some things that just didn't quite make sense.
[time=1670] You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out.
[time=1676] There's a thing that's real for people who minister in the kingdom of God and Denny Howard deals with them a lot.
[time=1684] It's called pastor burnout.
[time=1688] And when we put in a spot that we ask pastors to do it alone, when we ask people to live that way, he just says really clear.
[time=1697] The work is too heavy for you, you can't do it alone.
[time=1700] Listen to me and I will tell you some advice.
[time=1709] And may God be with you.
[time=1711] You must be the people's representative before God and bring their disputes to him.
[time=1715] Teach them their decrees and laws and show them the way to live and the duties they are to perform.
[time=1720] But select capable men, select capable men from all the people, men who fear God, trust worthy men who hate dishonest gain
[time=1730] and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.
[time=1736] Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you, the simple cases they can decide themselves, that will make your load lighter because they will share it with you.
[time=1747] If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain.
[time=1755] That's the truth that we already talked about.
[time=1757] The leaders, when it's divided, are able to withstand the strain that happens during caring for the body.
[time=1765] The second thing is happens in the people.
[time=1769] Instead of going home at night, frustrated here, they go home and the word here says satisfied, but the real word in the Hebrew says shalom.
[time=1781] They go home in peace.
[time=1783] They leave having been with the body, having been with their leaders, and they leave in peace.
[time=1790] That's what God has called our men to do.
[time=1794] That's what God has called us all to do. They are supposed to be that.
[time=1799] But as we've seen here both, again, in Exodus and in 1 Peter and the plurality, it's not a design for one person.
[time=1809] It is a design of plurality for a group of leaders and they're called elders.
[time=1815] We saw it in 1 Peter 5 and Exodus 18.
[time=1820] Your second outline point there is God's model.
[time=1824] God's model is one of shepherds in sheep.
[time=1829] He has a desire and it's all over the passages in Scripture.
[time=1833] It's all over the passages from the Lord's Psalm to Acts 28.
[time=1839] He says, keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit.
[time=1847] That's the source, that's the root of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers.
[time=1853] Be shepherds of the church of God which he bought with his own blood.
[time=1859] And there again there's that overseer and shepherd all wrapped up in the same thing.
[time=1866] Letter A under that section of the outline is this concept of that the elders walk behind Jesus
[time=1876] at the same time as they walk before those who are called to follow.
[time=1883] It's a unique dynamic because at the same time that we are called to follow Christ,
[time=1892] we're called to be an example, we're called to be in that spot that's trying to discern the Spirit of God.
[time=1900] It's trying to be those men that are worthy of being followed and at the same time we're like you.
[time=1909] See because there's nowhere in any church in the world today that there's a man stepping to a pulpit or a podium
[time=1921] that's perfect.
[time=1923] He does not have, he does not have the full Jesus quality.
[time=1929] He is a man just like you and me, it's the same thing.
[time=1933] And so there's that Jesus being the good shepherd, the chief shepherd that we're called to follow
[time=1940] and the elders are called to follow him but at the same time we're called to lead others
[time=1949] and lead in a way that's worthy of being followed.
[time=1953] That's a unique spot.
[time=1955] Really clear that there's some functions.
[time=1958] The second letter there under B is there's functions that the elders are called to perform.
[time=1964] There's functions that we are called to do and they are commissioned.
[time=1969] They are called to do them, we are called to do them.
[time=1971] The first one is to lead and guide.
[time=1976] John 10 says, "My sheep know my voice and they follow me." There is a distorted things that happen.
[time=1985] Sheep are very easy.
[time=1986] I don't know how many people in here other than the ravers have owned sheep in your life but sheep are not the easiest things to corral or to have follow.
[time=1997] I had a conversation this week with, actually I don't know if they're out here, Alice Beachy's father.
[time=2005] Denny told me the story several years ago and the Holy Spirit brought it to my mind this week.
[time=2011] He used to work in a place where they used to have sheep go in to either go into auction
[time=2018] or to be sold or to be slaughtered.
[time=2022] They actually had, once they get transported there, when they get transported there,
[time=2028] it's really, really common that during the transport they get really startled.
[time=2034] They get really startled and they're not sure what they're supposed to do.
[time=2038] They don't know where to go and they certainly don't want to follow anything.
[time=2042] But they introduce a goat.
[time=2046] They introduce a goat into the back of the truck or the trailer.
[time=2050] And that goat in a matter of minutes will mingle among the sheep
[time=2056] and lead them out the back of the trailer.
[time=2060] Lead them out the back of the trailer to their next season of life or to what that looks like.
[time=2066] Sheep follow really easy and really fast.
[time=2070] That's one of the things that we need to make sure is the protection component as well.
[time=2075] That we're not allowing Timothy.
[time=2078] Timothy gets warned by Paul in this book that we're studying.
[time=2082] Look out. There's false teachers. There are people that are doing endless genealogies.
[time=2087] They're taking you into spots that are not healthy.
[time=2091] That's the warning. The elders are called to teach and to feed nourishment,
[time=2098] feed nourishment that brings spiritual growth to you and to them.
[time=2107] It's so important, actually, if you flip over, if you want to, X chapter 3.
[time=2112] X chapter 3, the disciples are actually having a little interaction that's going on over how widows are being handled on the list and what that looks like.
[time=2124] And they were being distracted, if you will.
[time=2129] Verse 3 says, "Brothers, choose seven men from among you who are known to be, for their qualification, full of the Spirit, and wisdom." We will turn this responsibility over to them.
[time=2144] And at that point, we're going to give our attention to prayer and to the ministry of the Word.
[time=2151] There are things that are so paramount.
[time=2154] The preaching of the Word and prayer that the disciples said, we're going to bring seven people into you. We're going to bring seven men.
[time=2161] They've got to be qualified. They've got to be full of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2163] They've got to be full of wisdom, but we're going to bring them in.
[time=2167] And we're going to give some of this care over to them.
[time=2171] That definition actually is going to fall into what Josh Rang is going to talk about next week with that rule of a deacon. But these guys, these leaders, we're going to be committed to prayer and proclaiming the Word of God.
[time=2187] Tonight, at six o'clock out in this foyer, we will continue to set the example that we've done for the last six, eight weeks, whatever that's been, that we will be praying in the foyer at six o'clock because we believe that the only way that we can move and that we can advance is by the Holy Spirit using those times of prayer to engage us and bring us a sense of unity and growth in the body.
[time=2211] If you haven't been there, please consider coming.
[time=2215] And I will ask those of you that have been there to consider looking at somebody that you know and inviting them and share a personal story of why it's meant something to you
[time=2228] that you would want to come back.
[time=2230] But prayer and the devotion to the Word, that was what these leaders were going to do.
[time=2236] The third function that they have is to get up close and actually touch.
[time=2242] See, the shepherd, the shepherd, those leaders can only do that effectively
[time=2248] if they have a picture, if they have a feel for what those sheep are like.
[time=2255] They need to get up close enough to know who they are, to know what your children's names are, to be engaged in a way that lets them know.
[time=2265] Because the shepherd is to be aware of somebody being hurt,
[time=2271] sheep, often because their wool being really thick, their wool can get really thick and they can actually have a puncture wound that will bleed and never come to the outside of the wool.
[time=2284] Unless you get close and start peeling back, peeling back those layers, you won't find the hurts that are deep and cause somebody to really want to come where everybody knows their name.
[time=2297] Where they understand the hurt of what that looks like and want to be engaged in that way and to care for sheep.
[time=2304] Because of a hurt in relationship, maybe it's sin in their life, whatever that is, but until you get close enough and there's proximity, then you can't.
[time=2313] You don't have a prayer of being able to nurture them to a next phase of growth.
[time=2320] We've talked about leading, we've talked about guiding, we've talked about being up close, we've talked about some protection.
[time=2327] The other thing is to provide a fold, to provide a place where every night
[time=2333] they could go back into and the sheep could go.
[time=2338] That's what this place is supposed to be.
[time=2344] This place is supposed to be the place where you come from the world, where you come from the world and you come into here and you put all those cares and you cast them on Jesus because of his beautiful name, my strong towel, all of those things and you come into here because it's a place where you can find relief.
[time=2363] That's what we're called for.
[time=2370] One of the things that's really important that you understand is that there's somebody standing in the gap, see a fold was often weird shaped, it was in the cleft of a mountain or whatever it looked like, but every good fold only had one place.
[time=2386] It only had one place for the sheep to get in and also for the shepherd to get in,
[time=2393] so that it kept out all of those things which were dangers while they were trying to find rest.
[time=2401] While they were exposed at their greatest time of vulnerability, while the sheep were trying to find rest, that's why it's so important that the doctrinal purity that the word is what's proclaimed so that when we come in here, it's not only a place of rest, but it's where the truth is proclaimed unequivocally
[time=2420] because it's a power of Christ that makes the difference.
[time=2423] The final function is for correction, not only of wrong teaching, but of strange sheep.
[time=2432] It's true, not everybody in here, not everybody that ever comes, not everybody that you ever interact with is a perfect obeyer of the gospel,
[time=2443] and sometimes there needs to be loving correction and bringing them back
[time=2449] and pointing them towards the right path.
[time=2452] Titus 1, one of the other passages that talks about elder qualifications, he must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.
[time=2466] The truth is, as we're living in a world, we are living in a world where there are many as soon as you walk outside of those doors that create obstacles to the truth that we're trying to proclaim in here.
[time=2479] And if we aren't willing and we aren't able to step to the table and say, whoa, lie, lie, lie, lie, truth, lie,
[time=2489] that's the things that need to be proclaimed, and the elder has to be faithful to be able to do that.
[time=2495] Letter C is the one that's probably the hardest for every guy
[time=2503] that ever aspires to the office of elder.
[time=2506] It's they are meant to be examples to follow.
[time=2510] See, as I already said, there's not a guy that steps to a pulpit.
[time=2518] There's not a man that aspires to the office of elder.
[time=2521] There's not anywhere that there's a leader in any church.
[time=2525] That's perfect.
[time=2529] And Paul himself, Paul himself in multiple passages, 1 Corinthians 11, he says, follow me as I follow Christ.
[time=2540] It's that, it's that be imitators of me, he even says, he says, but remember, 1 Timothy 1, 15, he says, just a few chapters back, it's a trustworthy saying, Jesus Christ came to forgive sinners, of which what?
[time=2559] I'm the greatest. I'm the chief.
[time=2562] I'm the biggest sinner. Romans 7, he says, the good that I don't want to do, the bad that I don't want to do, I do the good, I don't, I'm a wretched man.
[time=2571] I'm full of this stuff and there's a war waging in my members.
[time=2576] And at the same time, he says, follow me as I follow Jesus.
[time=2582] Not because I'm a perfect example.
[time=2586] Not because you're elders, not because anybody that ever tries to teach is a perfect example. No, it's because they're trying to follow Christ and they're trying to be a model of grace and forgiveness and growth.
[time=2598] So now we've got this really tall order.
[time=2604] We've got some really high functions that these men are called to do.
[time=2612] So we land on God's provision again.
[time=2616] God's provision again is while we've got functions to perform, how in the world do we get men?
[time=2622] How do we get elders that are meant to be examples to imitate?
[time=2626] How do we find these kind of guys? What does it look like?
[time=2629] God gives us the type of character these guys are supposed to have.
[time=2633] And so the third bullet in your outline there is God's elder shepherd
[time=2640] as a man who is all these qualities.
[time=2643] And again, this is a model for the pattern of guy's life.
[time=2648] So we're going to flip to 1 Timothy 3, flip to 1 Timothy 3 with me.
[time=2652] And what I want you to do is as we read through this passage, as we read through this section, I want you to listen for a couple of things.
[time=2661] First of all, there is no way that any man that ever walked this earth has a prayer of being this kind of man apart from the Holy Spirit's ministry and the gifts of the Spirit and the fruits of the Spirit being manifested in this guy's life.
[time=2676] You will see some of those fruits in this passage.
[time=2681] The other thing that you will see is that they are patterns.
[time=2687] They are things that he's meant to be.
[time=2689] It's about character traits.
[time=2692] There's actually in the whole list only one thing that he's called to do.
[time=2697] There's only one thing that he's called to do.
[time=2700] Everything else is about the man that he is.
[time=2702] It's about being. It's not about doing.
[time=2705] My ears getting warm enough that my little headpiece is having a hard time
[time=2716] standing on my ear.
[time=2721] There's a reason that they're called the fruits of the Spirit, not the fruits of Rick.
[time=2724] Because when you get Rick, you get the flesh.
[time=2729] You get the man.
[time=2731] When they are the fruits of the Spirit, you get supernatural empowerment for the kingdom to make a kingdom difference, and that's why they matter.
[time=2739] So let's jump in 1 Timothy 3.
[time=2742] Here's a trustworthy saying.
[time=2745] "Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task." Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach.
[time=2761] Not given to drunkenness, not violent, but gentle, not quarrelsome,
[time=2767] not a lover of money.
[time=2769] He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him.
[time=2774] And he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect.
[time=2778] If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?
[time=2785] He must not be a recent convert, he may be or he may become conceited
[time=2791] and fall under the same judgment as the devil.
[time=2794] He must also have a good reputation with outsiders so that we will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap.
[time=2805] The first thing back up in verse 2, now the overseer must be above reproach.
[time=2813] That is the overarching thing.
[time=2817] He must be above reproach without accusation.
[time=2820] Literally the picture is that there's no handle, there's no handle, there's no thing sticking out for somebody to grab a hold of.
[time=2830] There's nothing as an example or a pattern in the guy's life that he is able to be called to the carpet on, if you will.
[time=2838] It's not an example, the example isn't perfection, that's not the model.
[time=2843] Because remember, nobody could be up here.
[time=2846] He is the husband of but one wife.
[time=2855] That literally translated is he is a one woman man.
[time=2859] You saw last week Steve Webster clearly is a one woman man
[time=2867] as he talked about the love of his life, Jody.
[time=2871] That's the kind of focus that he cares about, he has that concern.
[time=2876] She is the passion, he wants to protect and nurture and care for her.
[time=2880] Her countenance, this man's wife has a countenance.
[time=2884] It's not downtrodden, it's one of joy, it's not one of being oppressed.
[time=2889] She is someone that he wants to be with and wants to model.
[time=2896] Temperate means a modern, a balanced life.
[time=2902] Self-controlled fruit of the spirit, by the way, from Galatians 5.
[time=2909] I like to say that the fruit of the spirit of self-control is the ability to say no
[time=2915] to the things that you need to say no to.
[time=2918] I can't click there, I can't go there, my feet can't go there, I shouldn't listen to this.
[time=2924] But it's also the other side of the sword is that there are things that you need to say yes to.
[time=2931] It's not just saying no, it's the things that you need to say yes to.
[time=2934] And there's the wisdom to know the difference.
[time=2940] Respectable, this has both a sense of an inner respect that he's empowered,
[time=2946] that he has enough respect for himself, that he's empowered, and has not have so low of self-confidence that people wouldn't be wanting to follow.
[time=2955] It's also somebody that's worthy of being willing to follow, somebody being willing to follow.
[time=2963] Hospitable, he loves and welcomes strangers.
[time=2970] He makes people that he doesn't know feel comfortable.
[time=2973] Fruit of the spirit, I think, is associated with this one.
[time=2979] Kindness, there's a kindness that this guy exudes.
[time=2984] Able to teach, it's the one thing that he's called that he has to do.
[time=2993] He's got to be able to do it. He's got to be a workman that rightly divides the word of truth, studies to show himself, approved unto God a workman that needs not to be ashamed, and gets up and rightly divides the word.
[time=3006] App to teach, we talked about the significance of that already, being able to bring the truth to bear in a timely manner.
[time=3014] Literally, it's translated, skilled in teaching.
[time=3018] Next one's not given to drunkenness, not violent, but gentle, not quarrelsome.
[time=3026] Gentleness, by the way, is another fruit of the spirit, not quarrelsome.
[time=3029] This is the guy who's not looking to pick a fight.
[time=3032] He's not trying to start an argument with everybody that he gets in.
[time=3035] I'll even go this way.
[time=3037] There's a component that doesn't have a need to be right.
[time=3044] Not a lover of money. All the way back in Exodus 18, we had an example of somebody that wasn't looking for dishonest gain.
[time=3058] Todd Larson taught our men's group a couple weeks ago on Saturday morning that Jesus does not like dirty money.
[time=3067] He doesn't want anything to do with money that was taken from people in a dishonest way.
[time=3076] This man doesn't model that.
[time=3081] He must manage his own family well.
[time=3086] He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect.
[time=3091] If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?
[time=3097] It's a hard thing because our children aren't any more perfect than we are.
[time=3106] And those of you that know my three sons down here know that they're not any more perfect than that is.
[time=3112] But what does it mean for us to nurture an environment where we model grace, falling on the grace in the foot of the cross and the blood of Jesus,
[time=3123] that we model forgiveness, that there is mercy and forgiveness for those that boldly approach his throne to find it in time of need and then growth.
[time=3134] That there's grace enough, there's forgiveness enough, but there's an expectation that you're not who you used to be.
[time=3143] See, we shouldn't expect unredeemed people to act like redeemed people, but it is reasonable that we expect people that name the name of Christ to act like they're redeemed.
[time=3156] It's real, and it should start with the man's household.
[time=3170] Have a good reputation with outsiders.
[time=3174] First hour I had somebody actually in the room that used to work for me.
[time=3180] Those of you that ever led somebody in an employment situation know that's a certain level of exposure, right?
[time=3188] You want to have somebody that knows how a man is, ask the people that live in the house with him,
[time=3195] and then ask the people that work for him, or do business with him.
[time=3200] I believe this is a clear model. Paul was a tent maker. I don't believe Paul turned out junk tents.
[time=3210] He had a good reputation. He produced a quality product. He was honorable in his transactions.
[time=3219] Again, this is the pattern of these guys' lives. It's not perfection. It's not indicated to be that.
[time=3227] Because, remember, Paul is the guy that says, "O wretched man that I am, I'm the chief of sinners."
[time=3235] 2 Corinthians 12, 9, and 10, he's at this spot where he said, "I've asked God to take away three times this thing, whatever his thorn in the flesh was."
[time=3244] But he says, "My grace is sufficient, for my power is made perfect in your weaknesses.
[time=3252] Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, for when I am weak, then I'm strong."
[time=3258] That whole thing that my insults and all of those things are placed at the foot of the cross, covered by the blood of Christ.
[time=3266] And that's the example that we're called to be.
[time=3272] When somebody acknowledged that it's Christ working him and models that sense of vulnerability and weakness,
[time=3279] I would submit to you that it's the most powerful thing that enables you to want to follow.
[time=3289] Everybody knows that nobody's perfect. The question is, is what do you do when you're not?
[time=3296] Do you go fall at the feet of the cross and say, "His power is made perfect in my weakness."
[time=3305] The fourth outline point is that God calls his people to follow their shepherds.
[time=3313] You see, the body of Christ isn't just made up of leaders, it's made up of people that need to follow.
[time=3323] Because without followers, there's not much point in leading.
[time=3328] Hebrews 13, 17 is a pretty clear passage.
[time=3333] Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority.
[time=3343] Here's their accountability. Catch this.
[time=3347] Because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account.
[time=3355] See, their accountability isn't to people.
[time=3359] The accountability is to the chief shepherd, to Christ.
[time=3364] The accountability is that they, elders, we, Rick Raber, Chuck Nelson, Jim Doherty,
[time=3374] you fill in the blank, there's 14 of them, I'm not going to list them all.
[time=3378] The truth is, we will stand before Jesus Christ and be accountable for the way we lead.
[time=3387] There should be a component of you feeling comfortable and confident in the fact that we are going to have to do that.
[time=3399] Who would you rather have them be accountable to? You or Jesus?
[time=3410] Obey them so that their work will be a joy and not a burden for it would be of no profit to you.
[time=3416] The truth is that you can follow as an individual in a way.
[time=3421] You can follow as an individual in a way that makes it joyful for those who lead you.
[time=3426] And you can also make it a burden.
[time=3430] And it says pretty clearly here, if you make it a burden, understand there's no benefit in it for you.
[time=3440] We all will stand to the same Jesus and be accountable for how we follow and how we lead.
[time=3448] I would ask you to apply this entrusting principle to entrust yourself with confidence to those who lead.
[time=3458] It's an active thing, it's not a passive thing.
[time=3462] It is a willing component that you place yourself confidently because the elders are going to answer.
[time=3471] For each one of us, call ourselves Christ followers, there is a call not to be perfect, but to be real and authentic and let the blood of Jesus Christ be the thing that brings us freedom to know and be known at the deepest levels with those we live our lives with.
[time=3493] Let me pray. Father, we just thank You for the truth of Your Word this morning.
[time=3500] Thank You for the reality of how it speaks to us in leadership.
[time=3505] Thank You for how it speaks to our congregation and what it means for people to follow.
[time=3510] God, I pray that the men that would be here this morning, that may not feel like they fit the bill.
[time=3516] God, that You would take that sense away and have them fall to the foot of the cross, that it wouldn't be a sense of defeat.
[time=3524] God, empower them.
[time=3526] We thank You for the privilege of breaking Your Word this morning, breaking it into chunks that we can understand.
[time=3531] Thank You for Your Holy Spirit doing that. In Jesus' name, we pray.
