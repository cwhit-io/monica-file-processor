[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] >> Well, good morning, everyone, and as always, thank you for watching the Bible
[time=38] Hour. My name is Steve Webster. I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries. God is at work
[time=44] in this place in our community. Our discipline, our goal, what we strive after is to keep in
[time=51] step with the spirit, to make sure that our efforts are in alignment with the word of God.
[time=57] In this season of transition that we find ourselves in, you've heard from many different people,
[time=63] some of our elders, some of us as teaching pastors. On Sunday morning, you've heard from a lot of us in our discipline and our goal and our earnest desire is to do what God's word says.
[time=74] In 1 Timothy, which we're talking about at this present moment, we're going through a series where Paul is talking to young Timothy and saying, "Timothy, here's how your church, the people of your church should be operating together." And we want to make sure that everything that we're doing in this place is an increasing, ever-increasing alignment with what God's word says, with what
[time=95] we're teaching, with how we're gathering together, with how we treat each other, all of those things.
[time=99] And I think, prayerfully, we have pursued that diligently and are seeing an increasing measure
[time=108] day by day. I tell you often that I'm thankful that you're watching because you are part of our family. And as always, I want to encourage you to reach out to us, to let us know how you're doing.
[time=118] If you have needs, we would love to be able to meet those needs in whatever way that we can.
[time=123] A couple things to mention to put on your radar that we're excited about in the coming days.
[time=128] First of all, starting on October 26th and then the following two Sundays after that, we're going to have a connecting fair in the lobby of our church where all of our smaller communities are going to have an opportunity to really communicate with the people in our church and our community but ways in which they can gather together and really get needs, men's ministry, women's ministry,
[time=148] during the week, small groups, Sunday morning, Bible study groups, all of those things are going to be on
[time=154] display starting October 26th and going the next two Sundays after that. So that's an opportunity for you to come see us, which we also often ask you to do. And we would love to see you on that day.
[time=164] Also coming up in mid-November is our big serve. We very much believe that our place in this community
[time=170] is first and foremost to be servants. Now it's going to manifest itself on a Saturday morning in us leaving this place, these four walls, and going out to serve in whatever way we can in the surrounding area.
[time=183] That's our great privilege, it's our responsibility, and we're really excited about it.
[time=187] So be watching for more information about that too.
[time=191] Again, dear friends, thank you for watching. Thank you for watching for as long as you've been watching and for all the feedback that you give us about ways in which this program is an encouragement to you.
[time=201] Thanks again, have a great week, and God bless.
[time=226] [MUSIC - 41 seconds]
[time=280] Well, if you have your Bibles, take them and turn to 1st Timothy chapter 3.
[time=288] Those of you who don't know me again, my name is Josh Rang.
[time=290] I am on the teaching team here at Blackhawk.
[time=294] Grew up here at Blackhawk.
[time=296] Went to the school kindergarten through 12th grade, and I've been here for a long time.
[time=301] So it's a privilege to be standing up here and being a part of your lives in this way.
[time=307] I am trying to, with my spring outfit, still drive the frost away.
[time=314] I was really disappointed with that white stuff on the grass this morning, but we'll try to get over that.
[time=322] 1st Timothy chapter 3, we are in the midst of a series on 1st Timothy walking through the book.
[time=329] Again, the apostle Paul writing to his young son in the faith, Timothy, for him to stay at Ephesus and lead that church.
[time=339] So as we get into 1st Timothy chapter 3, and as we look at and study the role of Deacon this morning,
[time=345] I want to come back again real quick.
[time=347] I've talked about this before when I've been up here, but I want to bring it back again.
[time=351] It's just understanding when we interpret Scripture, one of the things that we look to first and foremost is context.
[time=359] Context is king, so what does a passage have to do with the surrounding passages that are with it?
[time=366] So when we're looking at a sentence or we're looking at a verse or we're trying to understand a paragraph,
[time=373] we need to understand what the other paragraphs and sentences and the entire book has to say and how that informs the specific verse
[time=383] or the specific paragraph that we're trying to understand.
[time=387] I believe that there's a little A author, which is the apostle Paul, but more than that as we step back,
[time=394] there's a big A author as God through the Holy Spirit inspired these words upon the pages as the apostle Paul wrote them down.
[time=405] And so it's important for us to understand what it says, but also what it says allows us to understand what God was trying to accomplish in
[time=414] and through us and what it does in our lives.
[time=420] So I just want to quickly run through again 1 Timothy. So in 1 Timothy chapter 1, Paul is writing to again his young son in the faith,
[time=429] asking him to remain on at Ephesus.
[time=432] And there he charges him or he addresses him and says, the idea of maintaining a gospel culture,
[time=440] defending its doctrine and defending its practice.
[time=443] And he instructs Timothy to charge certain persons not to teach a different doctrine.
[time=449] And then he goes into how these other teachers, these false teachers used the law.
[time=455] They used it in a way that was not in accordance with the gospel.
[time=460] And Paul was instructing Timothy for the law to be used in accordance with the gospel.
[time=465] So the law was there as Galatians says as a tutor to lead us to Christ.
[time=472] So the law was there to show us that we can't attain this standard of perfection and we need a Savior.
[time=478] We need a Redeemer. And that Redeemer is Christ.
[time=481] So that law was there to point us to Christ.
[time=484] And then as he moves on into 1 Timothy, he has his own personal testimony of the gospel.
[time=493] When he says in verse 15, this is a trustworthy statement and deserves full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the foremost.
[time=507] And then three verses later, he says, "I charge you, Timothy." Verse 18, "I entrust to you, Timothy, to continue on to wage the good warfare."
[time=519] And then he moves into chapter two with this idea of the gospel continuing.
[time=524] As he asks for people to pray, pray specifically that others would come to know Christ.
[time=531] In verse three, it says, "This is good and it's pleasing in the sight of God our Savior who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth."
[time=544] And then as he works through the rest of chapter two, it's this idea of not letting the things of this world and the concerns of this world, whether it's for men or women, not allowing those things to get in the way of the greatest endeavor ever,
[time=560] which is, again, just building, preaching the gospel and seeing the church of Christ grow.
[time=568] Then he moves into chapter three, as Mr. Raybur spoke to us last week about God's design to protect this culture with leaders in the church and those leaders were elders.
[time=581] And now we move in, as you can see from chapter one, all the way to now, just this flow of thought, this argument that starts in verse one and goes all throughout 1 Timothy.
[time=593] Beautiful emphasis upon the gospel to defend it and affirm it and preach it.
[time=599] We move into a section on deacons this morning, another line of defense as we talk about leadership within the church.
[time=610] So let's read 1 Timothy chapter three, starting in verse eight.
[time=616] Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain.
[time=625] They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience and let them also be tested first, then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless.
[time=635] Their wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober-minded, faithful in all things, let deacons each be the husband of one wife, managing their children and their own households well.
[time=648] For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
[time=655] Verse 14, I hope to come to you soon, but I'm writing these things so that if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of truth.
[time=670] Great indeed we confess is the mystery of godliness. It was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world and taken up in glory.
[time=688] Four questions this morning that we're going to ask and attempt to answer from God's word.
[time=694] Number one, what is a deacon? Number two, who can be a deacon? Number three, what does a deacon do? And number four, why is this so important?
[time=707] But would you pray with me this morning before we jump into these four questions?
[time=714] Father, we do affirm this morning what a beautiful name, the name that is above every name, the name by which under heaven we can be saved, the only name.
[time=731] And so, God, we come this morning longing to hear more about you, longing to understand more and more about your scriptures, specifically this morning, would you open our eyes to see your design for leadership in the church?
[time=748] God, we need your help. So God speak to us, lead us through your spirit. In Christ's name we pray these things, amen.
[time=761] Question number one, comes just in verse eight, you can see the very first word in our section is deacons.
[time=768] And so we need to understand that term, the word used there is deaconos. It's used three different ways throughout scripture, but in every use it carries the same denotation.
[time=781] Same definition, it's that of servant. I think it's used three different ways, as I said before, it's used in a general sense, probably the broadest sense of the term.
[time=793] It's used in a refinement of a spiritual gift and then it's used in our passage today specifically in the office of deacon or leadership within the church.
[time=806] So let's take a look at each of these real quick to understand this word a little bit more.
[time=810] First of all, this most broad sense in a general term, the word deacon can mean table server or literally just servant.
[time=820] If we go back to Jesus' first miracle, the wedding feast, as the wine was out and the servants went to the mother of Jesus Mary and said, "Hey, we're out of wine."
[time=833] And she says, "We'll go and ask Jesus." And he turns the water into wine and remember that wine was better than the original wine.
[time=840] But he says this, actually it says this in John chapter 2, "His mother said to the servants," literally that could read, "His mother said to the deacons."
[time=851] They were servants, servers at the wedding. They were serving the people at that wedding, a table server.
[time=862] It could be a servant in Matthew 20, verse 26, it says this, "Jesus was speaking that said, "It shall not be so among you, but whoever would be great among you must first be your deacon."
[time=874] You're servant.
[time=877] In Romans chapter 13, as he talks about the authorities that he has established, that God has established, he says this, "For he, the ruler, is God's deacon or servant for the people's good."
[time=892] God has established authorities, and those authorities are God's deacons.
[time=899] So the broadest use of this term or the most general use is this idea of a servant, someone who serves someone or serves something.
[time=908] But it's also used in a second sense. When we go to the list of spiritual gifts in the book of Romans chapter 12, it says this,
[time=917] "Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use these gifts if it's prophecy in proportion to our faith."
[time=926] And here it is, if service in our serving, we could translate that originally, if deaconing or if deacon in our deaconing.
[time=939] I mean, that's the actual word that's there.
[time=943] And then there's a third use that gets a little bit more specific, and it is the literal role or office inside of the local church.
[time=953] In Philippians chapter 1, verse 1, it says this, Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, and it talks about who they're writing to,
[time=961] the church of Philippi, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi with the overseers and the deacons.
[time=970] It was an official role inside the church.
[time=974] Examples also, Paul refers to Apaphras in Colossians chapter 1 as a deacon in the church, to Ticchicus in Colossians chapter 4 as a deacon in the church.
[time=986] In Romans 16, Phoebe was recognized as a deacon in a specific church.
[time=994] So as we look at question 1, what is a deacon?
[time=998] At the core of the meaning of this word lies the term servant.
[time=1003] A deacon is a servant, and in a general sense we are all called to deacon.
[time=1011] Some are gifted by the Holy Spirit in unique ways to deacon, and still others fill the specific role of deacon inside the walls of a local church.
[time=1024] As we move on, when we refer to deacon from this point on, we'll be talking about that third way that the word deacon or diocanos is used, the office of deacon.
[time=1035] So the second question, who can be a deacon?
[time=1039] It takes up the primary space in our passage this morning, the qualifications, but also not just qualifications, we'll talk about gender as well.
[time=1049] But first, the qualifications. Similar to the elders, I want you to see very clearly that there's not much difference between the qualifications for an elder and the qualifications for a deacon.
[time=1062] But let's take a look at them. Number one, it says dignified in verse 8.
[time=1067] Deacons likewise must be dignified.
[time=1070] It's respectable character combined with a seriousness of purpose.
[time=1075] A gravitas is a word that's used. It's weighty.
[time=1079] That's where we get the idea of gravity, just kind of bringing us down.
[time=1083] There's a weight to this person. There's a seriousness of purpose.
[time=1087] This person understands the weight of our human condition and takes it very seriously.
[time=1093] It doesn't mean that they're not full of joy and that they can have fun, but they understand that there's a seriousness to the plight of humanity.
[time=1101] Verse 8 also says not double-tongued.
[time=1104] It simply means saying one thing to one person and then going out and saying a completely different thing to someone else.
[time=1113] Speaking out of both sides of your mouth, right?
[time=1117] A deacon is not double-tongued. Third, they're not addicted to much wine in verse 8.
[time=1123] The idea here is the idea that it's not on your mind.
[time=1129] Wine or alcohol does not occupy your thoughts as to a specific need of it or even a specific want of it.
[time=1138] It doesn't go there in your mind. There's no space there that says I really need some or I really want some alcohol.
[time=1147] There's no addiction there. It's a clear mind. They're not addicted to that.
[time=1152] Verse 8, number 4, says not greedy for dishonest gain.
[time=1157] It literally just means greedy for money.
[time=1161] This person certainly works hard to earn a living.
[time=1166] There's nothing wrong with that. In fact, that's very honorable.
[time=1170] But this person is not conniving for ways to make more money specifically in dishonest ways or in ways that would take advantage of others.
[time=1183] Deacon is not greedy for dishonest gain.
[time=1186] Verse 9, it says this, that they hold fast to the mystery of faith with a clear conscience.
[time=1192] This is fascinating. Mystery of faith. Let's take a look at this little phrase.
[time=1196] Mystery of faith is really talking about the revelation of Jesus in our time.
[time=1202] Mystery in the New Testament is always defined as something which was once hidden in the past but now has come to full revelation.
[time=1213] Something that we couldn't understand before, now we can. Romans 16, it says this.
[time=1221] Now to him who was able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ.
[time=1227] According to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages but now has been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations.
[time=1240] There's this idea that, and what we'll see in a minute is that what the prophets were writing, they didn't completely even understand.
[time=1248] But now we get to see a full picture of Christ and his work and what he's accomplished.
[time=1256] And Ephesians chapter 3 says it this way.
[time=1260] For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles.
[time=1266] Assuming that you've heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me, was given to me for you, how the mystery was made known to me by revelation as I have written briefly.
[time=1277] When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed, it says, to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.
[time=1294] This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
[time=1304] It goes on, "Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace which was given to me, though I am the very least of all the saints this grace was given to preach the Gentiles, the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone
[time=1322] what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things so that through the church, a manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.
[time=1333] This was according to the eternal purpose that he's realized in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[time=1339] One last place that I just want to make this clear.
[time=1343] In 1 Peter, it's talking about such a great salvation and it says this in verse 10.
[time=1350] Concerning this salvation, the prophets who once prophesied about the grace that was to be yours, they searched and inquired carefully
[time=1360] and inquired what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when they predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories.
[time=1369] Verse 12, this is amazing, it was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven,
[time=1385] things into which angels long to look.
[time=1390] This gospel, this mystery of Christ that he was coming was even hidden from the angels for a while.
[time=1398] And you can see there it says that they even long to understand what God was going to accomplish in human history through his son Jesus.
[time=1409] This mystery was to be held with a clear conscience it says in our passage.
[time=1415] I believe that's just talking about not with perfect understanding but with genuine faith and trust in what God has revealed, no wavering.
[time=1428] A deacon then is to hold fast, not release his or her grasp on the message of Christ and his cross.
[time=1439] Six characteristic or qualification in verse 10, he's blameless, that simply means this that they cannot hold a charge against them.
[time=1447] Again, not that they're perfect but that this person would make things right quickly.
[time=1454] When sin takes place the deacon runs to Christ for covering.
[time=1458] There's no attempt to conceal or to cover and as such there is no way for a charge to be brought up against him or her.
[time=1468] That word blameless is the same word that's used describing us as we stand before God blameless.
[time=1475] We certainly aren't but because of the covering of Christ and his work for us we can be blameless.
[time=1483] That there would not be a charge held against us because Christ took it all.
[time=1490] The deacon is somebody that holds dearly to that mystery of faith and then applies it to his or her own life so that when sin takes place they're running to the grace in the cross of Christ.
[time=1505] 7 verse 12, we'll come back to verse 11, the husband of one wife, Rick talked about this last week but again this idea of having or being a one woman man, having the consistent character of purity of thought and deed.
[time=1521] This person one, I believe, believes that women were not created to be looked at or to be viewed as a piece of property.
[time=1529] This person takes the far path.
[time=1533] In Proverbs 5 the father is talking to the son and he's talking about the temptations of the way word woman and there he says to not even go close to her door but to take the far path.
[time=1548] I believe that this person, this deacon or even the elder for that matter is one who puts up fences who doesn't even go close to temptation but would take the far path so that temptation would not come into their sphere.
[time=1567] I believe it's black, black hawks position that one's past failures in this does not disqualify him or her automatically but a departure from God's instruction in this area must be repented of and in the rear view mirror of one's life and a new pattern of purity has been clearly established.
[time=1591] Not months, more like years.
[time=1597] Verse 12 goes on to an eighth qualification, managing their household well.
[time=1602] That word manages the key and it's just talking about giving proper care and attention to their house whether there's a wife or children but to their whole household that their world is in order and orderly.
[time=1617] I don't believe the children need to be saved but there should be a respect and consistent obedience.
[time=1626] I also don't believe that this necessitates that one must be married.
[time=1631] I believe the scriptures allow for the fact that a single person can be in this role as deacon inside of the church.
[time=1641] Those are eight qualifications and again they're the very same qualifications that an elder has but there's one difference.
[time=1649] There's one thing that's not similar that you will not find here a requirement to be able to teach for a deacon.
[time=1656] That's reserved for the elder.
[time=1659] So a deacon is not a second class officer in the church.
[time=1663] They're to be just as qualified as an elder.
[time=1667] They simply do not teach or provide oversight.
[time=1671] It's the qualifications.
[time=1672] Secondly, gender.
[time=1674] The leadership at Blackhawk believes that deacon can be either a man or a woman.
[time=1678] Look at verse 11.
[time=1679] It says their wives there.
[time=1681] Wives is a Greek word that can be translated either wife or woman.
[time=1686] The ESV which I'm reading from translates it wife.
[time=1690] I disagree with that.
[time=1692] The word used is translated over 200 times in the New Testament and it's translated both woman and wife.
[time=1700] So it could be interpreted either way.
[time=1703] The majority of times it's translated woman.
[time=1707] There's two reasons why I think this refers to a deaconess or a woman who can fill that role.
[time=1713] One is this, if you look at 1 Timothy chapter 3 in the requirements for elders and you go to Titus 1 where there's another requirement for elder there.
[time=1721] There's no mention there that an elder's wife should conduct herself with these qualifications.
[time=1729] So therefore the qualifications for deacon would then be more stringent than those of elders.
[time=1736] I just simply don't think that's the case.
[time=1739] Secondly, Paul makes reference to a woman in scripture who was a deacon.
[time=1744] In Romans chapter 16 he refers to Phoebe and addresses her as a deacon and specifically a servant of the church and not the church as a whole but a specific local church.
[time=1761] So I believe women can be deacons and then in verse 11 there are qualifications for them as well.
[time=1769] They're to be dignified, the same exact word used for men.
[time=1773] They're also to not be gossips, which doesn't just mean simply talking about others.
[time=1779] It means that this person is not prone to slander or accuse falsely.
[time=1785] This person believes the best about others, communicates the best about others.
[time=1790] The root word for this gossip is a title of Satan.
[time=1794] It's the accuser.
[time=1797] So the deaconess is not an accuser, not a gossip.
[time=1801] Their temperate simply means sober-minded.
[time=1804] It means having a clear mind not clouded by anything.
[time=1809] And then forth it says in verse 11 that they take God at his word.
[time=1812] They're faithful in all things.
[time=1816] They take God at his word and they trust in his word or in his promises and in his provisions for all of life.
[time=1826] So what is a deacon?
[time=1828] Question one, the core of the meaning of this word lies the term servant.
[time=1832] A deacon is a servant in a general sense we're all called a deacon.
[time=1836] Some are gifted uniquely by the Holy Spirit and still others feel a specific position inside the church.
[time=1844] Two, who can be a deacon?
[time=1846] A deacon is a man or a woman, I believe, who is qualified to fill the position based upon the ongoing character of the individual.
[time=1854] Third question, what does a deacon do?
[time=1859] If you have your Bibles turned to Acts chapter 6.
[time=1863] In Acts chapter 6 the apostles were there and there was an argument that came to the forefront from the Hellenists that said,
[time=1871] "Our widows aren't being treated the same way." It says this, in these days, verse 1 of Acts chapter 6, when the disciples were increasing a number,
[time=1881] a complaint by the Hellenists rose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.
[time=1887] That was food and provision.
[time=1890] And the twelve, some in the full number of the disciples and said, "It's not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables, to deacon."
[time=1900] Therefore, brothers, pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the spirit and wisdom, whom we will appoint to this duty.
[time=1908] But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.
[time=1913] Actually that word ministry of the word is deaconing.
[time=1917] The elders are to be a servant of the word.
[time=1922] So that found that was pleasing in the whole gathering.
[time=1926] And so deacons were established.
[time=1929] And so I think number one, what do deacons do in a broad sense?
[time=1936] Deacons allow elders to focus on their duties.
[time=1943] So whatever it is that can clear the plate off of an elder so that the elder can devote themselves,
[time=1949] the elders can devote themselves to prayer and to the service of the word,
[time=1955] understanding the word and to be able to teach the word and explain the word.
[time=1960] That's what a deacon does.
[time=1964] Pray and be a servant of the word, not the tasks of daily ministry.
[time=1972] So secondly, if we look at that a little closer, then deacons are then to perform the tasks of daily ministry.
[time=1980] They're the frontline ministers. They're an extension of the elder.
[time=1985] And what does that look like? I don't know exactly.
[time=1988] But here's a list that certainly isn't exhaustive.
[time=1991] But here are some ideas that would fit.
[time=1994] Someone who manages the resources and families for the vine.
[time=2001] Someone who organizes meals for a family or organizes a prayer chain for a specific need in our church.
[time=2009] It can be managing the details of an ABF or a small group or even a children's Sunday school class.
[time=2017] It could be organizing events for fellowship.
[time=2019] It could be opening the doors and being the first wave of welcome to those who would enter our building.
[time=2028] Some deacons might even counsel.
[time=2031] They might spend time bringing truth to bear upon individuals or marriages or certain situations.
[time=2038] It may be taking the role or the responsibility of the budgeting of the church off of the elders' table and allow them to pray and to understand God's word.
[time=2053] So what does a deacon do? A deacon is a frontline ministry person performing the daily tasks of ministry.
[time=2059] They're an extension of the elder as to their service as their service allows elders to devote themselves
[time=2067] to the prayer and the word of God.
[time=2071] Our last question this morning, why is this so important?
[time=2075] We look at verses 14 through 16 and I believe that 14 through 16 are helping us understand kind of why it's so important,
[time=2083] not just that deacons would be functioning in their role, but also we go back to the beginning of chapter 3
[time=2089] and why it's so important for elders to be functioning.
[time=2092] So why is it so important for elders and deacons to be functioning in their role in this way?
[time=2099] I think the passage gives us two reasons.
[time=2102] One is this.
[time=2106] The church has an awesome privilege and responsibility to support a firm, defend and proclaim the gospel,
[time=2116] the person and work of Christ.
[time=2119] The second reason is this. There has always been and there will always continue to be those who attempt
[time=2128] to draw humanity away from a pure, simple and clear devotion to Christ and the good news of his gospel.
[time=2138] Let's take a look at these in order.
[time=2141] First, reason one, the church is responsible to support a firm, defend and proclaim the gospel.
[time=2146] You see, God has designed and ordered the church as the keeper, defender of a universal and eternal treasure.
[time=2156] There's nothing more valuable.
[time=2158] This treasure is the revelation of the Creator God and how he has stepped into time to rescue and redeem a people
[time=2168] through his own intentionally planned crucifixion so that his people could live in the good of what he has done
[time=2177] and glorify him into eternity.
[time=2182] Let's take a closer look at these verses to see Paul's argument, to see this emphasis upon Christ and his gospel.
[time=2189] I believe it comes in two different ways.
[time=2191] And it says here, in verse 15, that the church is the pillar and buttress of truth.
[time=2200] Pillar just simply means to make stand or to make firm. It means to uphold.
[time=2205] Support means to prop up or support.
[time=2209] So the church has the responsibility of guarding and upholding the truth.
[time=2213] But what does that term truth mean?
[time=2216] The Greek word there is allethea. It means the reality of God and his relationship with mankind and his world.
[time=2224] It's not simply doctrine or a list of what we believe.
[time=2228] It has much more to do with an understanding of the way that God has chosen to interact with and redeem humanity,
[time=2237] specifically the truth of the gospel.
[time=2240] Commentators agree that when Paul uses the word truth in the pastoral epistles, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus,
[time=2250] that he equates that word truth with the gospel.
[time=2257] So this truth, the church has the responsibility of guarding and upholding is the truth about Christ and what he's done.
[time=2268] The church is the pillar and buttress of the truth.
[time=2272] Secondly, the church has a common confession. Look at verse 16.
[time=2275] Great indeed we confess is the mystery of godliness, and then it goes to this beautiful description of Jesus.
[time=2283] This confession has everything to do with the mystery of godliness which centers around the person of Christ.
[time=2290] We already looked at the term mystery and understood how that applies to the coming of Christ, the revelation of Christ and what he's accomplished.
[time=2298] But then it goes on to say this, that we confess.
[time=2301] That word simply isn't just meaning a declaration of something.
[time=2304] It actually means something that is a common confession.
[time=2308] It means to say the same thing. It's something that's agreed upon with the consent of all in the body of Christ without controversy.
[time=2319] This is the center of the Christian faith.
[time=2324] It's the gospel. It's Christ and His work.
[time=2328] Christ is the non-negotiable.
[time=2333] And He's also the source of unity among all true believers regardless of denomination.
[time=2340] It's a common confession that the church holds on to and proclaims the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2351] Why is this so important?
[time=2355] Reason one, again, the church is responsible to support a firm defend and proclaim the gospel, the person of Christ.
[time=2362] Reason two, there has always been and there will always continue to be those who attempt to draw humanity away from a pure, simple and clear devotion to Christ and the good news of His gospel.
[time=2375] It happened in New Testament times.
[time=2378] Ephesians, again, Ephesians chapter four.
[time=2383] Ephesians four says this.
[time=2385] It talks about how God gave some as apostles and teachers for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry.
[time=2391] It says this, "For the building up of the body of Christ until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, and get this so that we would no longer be children tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine,
[time=2412] by human cunning, by craftiness and deceitful schemes.
[time=2416] Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into Him who is the head into Christ."
[time=2426] You see the distinction there?
[time=2428] There are some who are wanting to take us away from Christ, and yet Paul is saying there that we need to build each other up into Christ.
[time=2438] Colossians chapter four, actually, sorry, Colossians chapter two, verse four, says a very similar argument.
[time=2450] He says this, "I say this in order that no one may delude you with plausible arguments."
[time=2458] Verse six, "Therefore as you receive Christ Jesus, the Lord so walk in Him, rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, just as you were taught,
[time=2467] abounding and thanksgiving." Verse eight, "See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit according to human tradition,
[time=2479] according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ."
[time=2486] You see the distinction?
[time=2488] There are people in New Testament times that were wanting to take the spotlight off of Christ.
[time=2494] And Paul is going to great lengths in several different passages to say no, let's push each other into Christ and in proper understanding.
[time=2505] It goes back even to 1 Timothy chapter one with the wrong use of the law.
[time=2511] Their false teachers, the right use of the law, is to use it in accordance with the gospel so that we would see our need for a Savior and run to Christ.
[time=2523] That was in New Testament times. Today, false religions are there as well.
[time=2528] There was an article in Creation magazine that I read.
[time=2531] It was about, it was actually somebody that worked at Creation magazine.
[time=2535] They had been saved out of Mormonism.
[time=2539] And what he said there and relating to those that are in false religions, specifically for him for Mormonism, it was this.
[time=2546] He said, "Don't try to debate with them different views on doctrine.
[time=2551] Simply ask them this question.
[time=2554] Aren't you tired?" You see, whether it's Mormonism or any other false religion, every single day, every month, every year, you're working to find your acceptance before the God.
[time=2571] It's exhausting.
[time=2574] It's heavy.
[time=2577] There's a book, A TeleIntoVision, and I'll just reference the title because I think it's very appropriate.
[time=2583] It's called this, "Inexhaustible Grace for an Exhausted World."
[time=2590] Not only does it speak to false religions, but just speaks to the culture of our time.
[time=2594] Running, running, running, running, running.
[time=2599] And yet, that temptation falls to us sometimes as well.
[time=2607] To be drawn away from a devotion to Christ, we as Christians sometimes fall into that.
[time=2614] We worry instead of rest.
[time=2618] We're self-reliant trying to fix things on our own instead of falling to our knees.
[time=2624] Sometimes, it's just simply hard to believe the full scope of God's goodness to us through the gospel.
[time=2636] Well, a few words of application, and we'll finish this morning.
[time=2641] A word to all of us.
[time=2644] When we think about our common confession and we think about doctrinal matters, we need to have conviction with humility.
[time=2654] First of all, never bend on the common confession of Christ.
[time=2659] There's no debate.
[time=2661] He is the name above all names.
[time=2664] The only name under heaven by which men might be saved.
[time=2669] Secondly, have convictions around your views on those biblical matters which aren't central or salvific.
[time=2678] Believe them.
[time=2679] Understand the spirit working in your heart and have conviction about your views.
[time=2683] But then, thirdly, choose humility and unity when speaking to those who disagree.
[time=2690] Unity in our common confession of Christ is strong enough for our differences on other topics to exist peacefully.
[time=2698] A word to those who are not deacons.
[time=2704] Deacons should be, as verse 13 says, deacons should be held in high regard.
[time=2711] We should look at them and their service and their position and understand that they are to be reverent and held in high regard.
[time=2721] And then those who may not be deacons right now, the other thing I would say is this.
[time=2725] It's my hope that there are plenty in this room who will aspire to be in this role at this church.
[time=2734] 1 Timothy 3 1 talks about elders that says it's a good thing to aspire to be an elder.
[time=2740] I think it's a good thing to aspire to be a deacon as well.
[time=2745] And understand there's a period of testing, as verse 10 would apply to.
[time=2749] So understand this, if it's your desire to fill that office, live right now currently in a way that there is no question as to your qualifications.
[time=2762] A word to deacons.
[time=2764] Verse 13 would tell you that when you serve in the office, it will just build great confidence in your heart as to your own faith in Christ Jesus.
[time=2778] And then finally a word to each of us.
[time=2781] There is a real sense in which we're all called to deacon.
[time=2786] Whether we're an official church deacon or not, so I encourage all of us to start serving.
[time=2794] Start serving in this place, start serving in your community, if you're married, start serving in your marriage, if you have kids, start serving in your parenting.
[time=2810] We all are called to deacon.
[time=2814] So we've asked four questions this morning, we've gotten hopefully clarity around those questions.
[time=2821] I guess in all of this, as we think about this role or serving in all of this, where does your power and motivation come from?
[time=2828] Where should your power and motivation come from?
[time=2833] It should come from the greatest deacon that has ever walked the earth.
[time=2838] Jesus.
[time=2840] In Mark 1045, Jesus says this, "For even the Son of Man did not come to be deaconed but to deacon and to give his life as a ransom for many."
[time=2859] As the choir comes up, take a minute to think about that.
[time=2864] The Creator God was willing to come down and to serve or deacon you.
[time=2876] I believe in the book of 1 Timothy, there's kind of three ways that he's done that.
[time=2881] His deaconing is very purposeful.
[time=2883] In chapter 1, verse 15, it says this, "That Christ Jesus came in the world to save sinners.
[time=2888] He came into this world with a purpose, with a devotion to come to Calvary and to redeem a people for his own name and glory."
[time=2897] It was purposeful, his deaconing.
[time=2899] It was a deaconing of inclusion in chapter 2, verses 3 and 4.
[time=2903] It says that God wants all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of truth.
[time=2910] We can't pick and choose who to serve and who not to serve.
[time=2914] That needs to be an inclusive group of people that says we're here to serve whoever we can serve.
[time=2922] Christ's deaconing was sacrificial.
[time=2925] In chapter 2, verse 6, it says this, "That Christ Jesus, he was the one who gave himself as a ransom for all."
[time=2935] His deaconing was sacrificial.
[time=2938] It was purposeful.
[time=2940] It was inclusive.
[time=2941] It was sacrificial.
[time=2943] You see, the reason that we can deacon with purpose, we can deacon with inclusion and sacrifice is because he has done it all for us.
[time=2954] No one has served you more or better than Jesus.
[time=2960] No one ever will serve you more. Our help comes from the Lord and with your heart full of Jesus' service towards you.
[time=2973] I ask you this morning to go with great gratitude and serve in whatever sphere of influence God has placed you.
[time=2982] Your marriage or in your home or in this church ultimately in this world.
[time=2989] And as the church with you playing your part, with all of us playing the part, we can continue to support a firm, defend and proclaim the gospel.
[time=3004] Oh God, thank you so much for the opportunity, the privilege of being your body and serving so that your name, that your church, the bride of Christ would move forward.
[time=3017] And God, thank you for showing us what that looks like in the way that you have deaconed us.
[time=3024] Oh God, thank you. Or would you fill our hearts this morning with great gratitude and hope and love in what you've accomplished for us. Christ's name will we pray. Amen.
[time=3039] Psalm 121 says, "I lift up my eyes to the mountains. Where does my help come from?
[time=3048] My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth. He will not let your foot slip. He who watches over you will not slumber.
[time=3058] Indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep."
[time=3065] The Lord watches over you. The Lord is your shade at your right hand.
[time=3070] The sun will not harm you by day nor the moon by night. The Lord will keep you from all harm. He will watch over your life. The Lord will watch over your coming and going, both now and forever more.
[time=3087] I will lift up my eyes to the hills from whence cometh my hand. My help comeeth from the Lord, the Lord which made heaven and earth.
[time=3114] He said, "He will not suffer thy foot, thy foot to be moved. The Lord which keepeth thee, he will not slumber nor sleep."
[time=3134] Oh, the Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is thy shade. Upon thy right hand. Upon thy right hand.
[time=3154] No the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night. He shall preserve thy soul even forever more.
[time=3176] My help, my help, my help.
[time=3190] All of my help comeeth from the Lord.
[time=3213] I will lift up my eyes to the hills from whence cometh my hand. My help comeeth from the Lord, the Lord which made heaven and earth.
[time=3233] He said, "He will not suffer thy foot, thy foot to be moved. The Lord which keepeth thee, he will not slumber nor sleep."
[time=3252] Oh, the Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is thy shade. Upon thy right hand. Upon thy right hand.
[time=3272] No the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night. He shall preserve thy soul even forever more.
[time=3294] My help, my help, my help.
[time=3307] All of my help comeeth from the Lord.
[time=3328] Oh, the Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is thy shade. Upon thy right hand. Upon thy right hand.
[time=3350] Oh, the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night. He shall preserve thy soul even forever more.
[time=3371] My help, my help, my help.
[time=3386] All of my help comeeth from the Lord, the Lord is thy shade.
[time=3399] He shall preserve thy hair. All of my help comeeth from the Lord.
[time=3418] My tool is thy fear, thy strength. All of my help comeeth from the Lord.
[time=3433] My help, my help, my help, my help, my help, my help, my help, my help.
[time=3462] All of my help comeeth from the Lord, thy hair.
[time=3478] My help, my help, my help, my help.
[time=3501] All of my help comeeth from the Lord.
