[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] >> Well, good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=36] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=37] I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Huck Ministries.
[time=40] And this morning finds us at the end of our series on First Timothy.
[time=44] Live it out, you're gonna hear from my good friend, Josh Rang, as the letter winds up.
[time=50] Just a minute or two together, friends, as we take a look back on First Timothy.
[time=55] And some reminders, some things that we've seen throughout the course of that letter, that Paul really wants Timothy to know.
[time=62] And by virtue of that, he really wants us to know as well, several things.
[time=67] Number one, the way the church gathers together, the way the church organizes itself matters.
[time=74] If Paul talks about that over and over again in this letter, it's meaningful, it's important.
[time=80] And so focusing on that seems to be a matter that we can't ignore and we're not here at the church.
[time=87] We're earnestly striving every day to get closer and closer alignment with what that letter lays out in terms of how we should be behaving together, how we should organize, how we should be led.
[time=97] So we would cover your prayers on that front, as we and our friends here,
[time=103] try to figure out how we're gonna be every day more closely aligned and in closer obedience to what First Timothy puts forth.
[time=113] The second thing that really has shined out to us from this letter is this the importance of knowing what right doctrine is.
[time=121] This is sound teaching that Paul talks about.
[time=124] They had already kind of bled into the church.
[time=126] They're an Ephesus and it was really confusing a lot of people.
[time=130] Like them, you and I today live in very, very confusing times and the need to be clear, the need to be very much aligned with what God's word says.
[time=142] That has never been greater.
[time=144] We have a greater and greater need day by day all the time to know what it is that God has said and how it is that we should be aligned to it.
[time=153] The analogy that we've used often here that you've heard us say before, more than once, is that bank tellers, for example, they don't study counterfeit bills to recognize when something phony comes across their desk.
[time=165] They have the real thing in front of them so that when a fake comes across, they say that's not right.
[time=169] That's pretty much exactly what Paul is calling Timothy to as a young pastor and Ephesus and what I would encourage you as our friends and members of our family here at Blackhawk to be mindful to remember what's true, what it is that God has laid out for us in his word that he wants us to be in alignment with day by day.
[time=189] Those two things really have, as I was thinking this morning about things to share with you, those two things really stuck out to me.
[time=198] We are in the holiday season here at Blackhawk.
[time=201] We're getting ready.
[time=202] We have a lot to be thankful for here.
[time=204] I trust that you do as well.
[time=206] I hope you're enjoying your weekend with your family this weekend.
[time=210] Christmas of Blackhawk is coming up right around the corner, so you'll be hearing again a lot more about that from us in the days to come.
[time=215] We, this year, are talking about the word on Christmas.
[time=220] So be looking for that from us coming up here in December.
[time=223] As always, thank you so much for watching, for being a part of our family.
[time=227] We invite you to come be with us, especially this holiday season.
[time=230] Come be with us, come say hi, tell us that you're watching right to us.
[time=234] Go to our website, follow us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter.
[time=240] Just communicate with us in some way to let us know how it is that the Bible has been a blessing to you and how it is that we can help you in the days to come.
[time=247] Thanks so much.
[time=248] Have a great week.
[time=257] [MUSIC]
[time=287] And have just a lady sing this first verse, and then the men will join on the second verse,
[time=303] the repeat.
[time=304] But ladies with you, sing to our king, worthy.
[time=310] >> Worthy is God, lamb who was slain, holy, holy is he.
[time=327] Sing a new song to him who sits on heaven's mercy, see.
[time=339] Men, would you join us worthy?
[time=342] >> Worthy is God, lamb who was slain, holy, holy is he.
[time=358] Sing a new song to him who sits on heaven's mercy, see.
[time=369] Holy, holy, holy is someone God almighty, who was and is and is to come.
[time=384] And Lord, creation I sing, praise to the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will
[time=404] be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my
[time=425] everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the
[time=440] king of peace, you are my everything, you are my everything, you are my all, you are my
[time=453] all, you are my all, you are my everything, you are my everything, and I will adore you.
[time=475] Sing a new song to him who sits on heaven's mercy, and I will be the king of peace,
[time=492] you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will
[time=502] be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my
[time=519] everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king
[time=526] of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace,
[time=545] you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will
[time=553] be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my
[time=570] everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king
[time=579] of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace,
[time=595] you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will
[time=617] be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my
[time=636] everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the
[time=655] king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything,
[time=662] and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace,
[time=679] you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will
[time=696] be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my
[time=705] everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything,
[time=714] and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace,
[time=721] you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace,
[time=748] you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my everything, and I will be the king of peace, you are my
[time=760] everything, and Jesus, knowing all that would happen to Him came forward and said to the
[time=767] band that was coming to take Him into captivity, He said to them, "Whom do you seek?"
[time=776] They answered Him, "Jesus of Nazareth, Jesus said to them, "I am He, the great I am."
[time=792] Judas who portrayed Him was standing with them, and when Jesus said to them, "I am He,"
[time=799] they drew back and fell to the ground, awesome wonder, awestruck wonder at the mention of
[time=812] His very name, the sovereign power of the universe willingly bound for our redemption
[time=824] and His glory.
[time=833] We will finish these verses this morning from 1 Timothy verses 11 through 21.
[time=840] Next week, Steve Longbreak will be with us, and he will do kind of a final overview of
[time=846] 1 Timothy for us, but this morning, the last 10 verses of Paul's letter to Timothy, and
[time=856] as we start out, I just ask, when's the last time that you've received a letter?
[time=864] It's been a while, right, and yet how great is it to get a letter, especially from someone
[time=877] that you love, someone that you respect, maybe a mentor in your life, and all of a sudden
[time=885] you get this letter from this person that you think so highly of.
[time=892] And what you do with that, right?
[time=895] You take it, maybe you grab a cup of coffee or a hot tea and you sit down and with great anticipation, you open up that letter and read every single word.
[time=910] Timothy, in the midst of his situation in Ephesus leading that church, has received a letter
[time=917] from maybe the one person that he wanted to receive a letter from other than anybody
[time=924] else, his mentor, his spiritual father, a man who had invested so much into his life.
[time=934] And here he gets this letter from him, and I can imagine Timothy with just great anticipation.
[time=942] I don't know if he opened up or unrolled or whatever he did, but he dug in to this letter.
[time=951] This communication from his spiritual father to him to look at it with great anticipation,
[time=959] having been left to lead the church in Paul's absence.
[time=964] Timothy now at a young age with some mild stomach ailment, somewhat unsure of himself,
[time=971] reminds himself in this place battling false teachers, contending for the gospel, shepherding
[time=979] those in the church.
[time=981] Paul writes this letter to him and instructs him.
[time=984] He's written on many topics.
[time=986] He instructed him on certain individuals, not to teach a different doctrine.
[time=992] He instructed him on roles of men and women.
[time=994] He instructed him on leadership in the church.
[time=997] He instructed Timothy in his own life to be an example to the flock, how to care for
[time=1004] widows, how to handle an elder caught and sin.
[time=1008] And right before our verses this morning, he reminds Timothy of the implications of chasing
[time=1015] after worldly cravings.
[time=1018] And he says in verse 11, "As a contrast to that, but as for you, O man of God, flee these things, these worldly cravings and pursuits, and pursue righteousness, gentleness, godliness,
[time=1035] faith, love, steadfastness." In other words, he's telling Timothy there to put forth effort toward obedience, which
[time=1044] is empowered by God's grace.
[time=1048] This idea of the put off and put on is a component of what I think it means to fight the good
[time=1055] fight of the faith, which is the main concept of Paul's final words to Timothy here in these
[time=1062] verses.
[time=1064] Would you read them with me this morning, starting in verse 11, "Fight the good fight
[time=1070] of the faith," verse 11, "but as for you, O man of God, flee these things, pursue righteousness,
[time=1076] godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness, fight the good fight of the faith.
[time=1083] Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
[time=1091] I charge you in the presence of God who gives life to all things and of Christ Jesus, who
[time=1097] in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
[time=1108] he will display at the proper time.
[time=1111] He who is the blessed and only sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords who alone
[time=1117] has immortality, who dwells in inapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see to him be honor and eternal dominion, amen.
[time=1127] As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
[time=1142] They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, thus storing
[time=1148] up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.
[time=1164] Avoid the irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge for by professing it.
[time=1170] Some have swerved from the truth, grace be with you.
[time=1180] Fight the good fight of the faith.
[time=1185] Two questions this morning as we look at that main idea of Paul's final instructions to
[time=1191] Timothy, what does it mean to fight the good fight of faith?
[time=1197] Question number one, question number two, how does one go about doing it?
[time=1203] So we'll look at those two questions this morning, spending the bulk of our time on the latter
[time=1209] of the two, but first, what does it mean to fight the good fight of the faith.
[time=1216] It's a phrase we probably are all familiar with.
[time=1219] It happens other places in Scripture as well, but quite literally in the Greek it reads
[time=1225] this, compete in the good competition.
[time=1230] It's the same Greek word used at the beginning at the end of that phrase, compete in the
[time=1236] competition.
[time=1238] Paul is using an athletic analogy, Timothy would have been well aware of.
[time=1243] In that day and time, the competition of games in the athletics were very ordinary.
[time=1249] There's an ongoing competition, an ongoing fight that Paul is wanting Timothy to understand,
[time=1255] but it's not just a fight of athleticism.
[time=1261] Typically here it says that it is the fight of the faith.
[time=1266] So what does it mean?
[time=1268] Well in 2 Timothy 4 verse 7, Paul at the very end of his life writes this, "I have fought
[time=1276] the good fight.
[time=1278] I have finished the race.
[time=1279] I have kept the faith." I think as we look at that, we can say this, that fighting the good fight equals finishing the race, which equals keeping the faith.
[time=1290] I think those terms are synonymous with one another.
[time=1293] It's the same concept in Jude chapter 1 when Jude writes and he says, "Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the
[time=1312] saints." There's this concept of the faith, of the Christian reality.
[time=1320] Hebrews 11 would say this about faith, it's the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction
[time=1327] of things not yet seen.
[time=1332] So Paul in this phrase is instructing Timothy to believe the truth about God and his workings
[time=1341] in the world.
[time=1344] See I think you can relate to because I believe that it is a daily battle to believe God.
[time=1351] It's a daily struggle to stay convinced of that which is not yet seen.
[time=1357] It's a daily battle to take him at his word.
[time=1362] Is he real?
[time=1368] How many of us have ever thought, is he good?
[time=1372] Is he just?
[time=1376] Is he the creator?
[time=1377] Is he loving?
[time=1379] Sometimes it doesn't feel like it.
[time=1380] Is he truthful?
[time=1382] Is he gracious?
[time=1383] Is there a heaven?
[time=1384] Is he even listening?
[time=1388] Can he be relied on?
[time=1392] Can he truly make me happy?
[time=1396] Can he even hear me?
[time=1397] Can he be in control of all this?
[time=1399] Can he make things right?
[time=1401] Can he forgive me and all that I've done?
[time=1407] Can I really be adopted into his family?
[time=1411] Does he even care about me?
[time=1413] You see, fighting the good fight of faith means competing and striving and battling
[time=1419] every day to place all of your trust and all of your hope and your entire life upon
[time=1426] the veracity and integrity and reliability of the word of God which graciously and wonderfully
[time=1434] communicates to us who God is, what he's like, what he's done, what he's currently doing
[time=1442] and what he's promised to do.
[time=1445] You see, his word tells us that he is true and that he is real and that he is good and
[time=1453] he's just, he's the creator, he is loving, he is gracious, there is a heaven, he is truthful,
[time=1461] he is listening, he can be relied on, he can make you truly happy, he can hear you and
[time=1473] he does hear you, he is in control of all that's going on, he will make things right,
[time=1484] he can forgive, I really can be adopted into his family, he does care about me.
[time=1496] You see, fighting the good fight of the faith means believing God and then allowing that
[time=1502] belief to then dictate your behavior.
[time=1507] In other words, living your life in such a way that reflects your belief, you see, whatever
[time=1513] you believe up here is going to get worked out in your behavior to some extent.
[time=1520] So this belief dictates a behavior, fighting the good fight of faith is believing correctly
[time=1530] and then having that belief work out in your life.
[time=1534] It's humbly submitting to him as creator because I truly believe that he created me, then I
[time=1542] am going to in turn allow that belief to dictate a behavior of humility that says I'm willing
[time=1549] to submit to you and what you've prescribed for me, running to him for comfort instead
[time=1557] of the lies of this world if I truly believe that he's all I need and that he's for me
[time=1563] and that he's giving me everything for my good and his glory, then why would I run anywhere
[time=1569] else for comfort and care?
[time=1578] It's treating others with kindness because he's treated you with unworldly kindness.
[time=1584] It's not worrying about bills and health and wayward kids and ISIS and Ebola because he
[time=1592] is in control and he is present and he is ruling and he is raining and he is working
[time=1601] everything, everything, everything out for his good.
[time=1611] It's forgiving others because you know and you believe how much you've been forgiven.
[time=1618] He's giving of your possessions because he gave himself.
[time=1624] You see this, faith is belief that dictates behavior.
[time=1630] An example of this is in Hebrews, Hebrews chapter 11 you might know it as the faith chapter.
[time=1637] By faith all these people did these amazing things.
[time=1641] By faith not of themselves but by faith.
[time=1644] One of them is Abraham, in verse 17 it says this, "By faith Abraham when he was tested
[time=1650] offered up Isaac." Now remember the context here, God had visited Abraham and said, "I am going to make you
[time=1659] a great nation and in you all the world will be blessed."
[time=1665] And yet there was no son, there was no heir and year after year after year went by and
[time=1672] his wife Sarah became older and older and older and there was no son, there was no heir,
[time=1678] there was no ability for God's promise to be kept without an heir.
[time=1682] And yet then God miraculously came and gave him Isaac and then not long afterward he
[time=1692] said, "Take Isaac your son, your only son and sacrifice him to me and listen to what
[time=1700] says here about this faith." When he was tested he offered up Isaac and he who had received the promise was in the
[time=1708] act of offering up his only son, of whom it was said, "Through Isaac shall your offspring be named." Listen to what he did, he considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead.
[time=1721] You see what Abraham believed about God?
[time=1726] That even if he sacrificed his son that God had the ability to raise his son from the dead and keep his promise to Abraham and that belief dictated a behavior that allowed
[time=1739] him to obey God and offer up his son without that belief, without that faith that behavior
[time=1748] doesn't follow.
[time=1752] Fighting the good fight of faith involves belief that leads to behavior.
[time=1760] That's what it is.
[time=1762] That's the good fight that we're all a part of.
[time=1767] Secondly, this morning, how does one do it?
[time=1771] How do we go about fighting this good fight of the faith and believing and allowing that
[time=1777] belief to dictate behavior?
[time=1779] Well, there's two commands in the rest of these verses.
[time=1783] The first command is in verse 12.
[time=1785] It's a command to take hold of the eternal life.
[time=1788] And there's a second command in verse 20 to guard the deposit that's entrusted.
[time=1793] We're going to have a quick Greek lesson here in a second.
[time=1796] For those of you, the Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew.
[time=1802] The New Testament was originally written in Greek.
[time=1805] And so we have the ability at times to go back and to look at it in the original language.
[time=1810] And what these commands are all about is there is a sense of urgency to both of these
[time=1816] commands.
[time=1817] The first command, though, has a sense of a personal aspect.
[time=1823] It's true in Timothy's life.
[time=1825] The second command has more of a global or corporate aspect that, yes, it's true in Timothy's life, but it also has impact beyond his own life to the advancement of God's
[time=1836] kingdom.
[time=1837] So one is more micro.
[time=1839] The other one is a little bit more macro and we'll understand that in a second.
[time=1842] The first command is this.
[time=1845] Take hold of the eternal life.
[time=1848] In Greek grammar, there are different ways to look at a word.
[time=1854] This word take hold of is an erist imperative.
[time=1859] It simply just means that it's a point in time.
[time=1862] It's supposed to happen whereas present means it happens and then it's to continue to happen.
[time=1869] Keep on doing this.
[time=1871] Well this erist with the middle voice means that there's a sense of urgency.
[time=1878] Do this now at once and once for all.
[time=1882] And the middle voice means this.
[time=1884] It means that the subject, the person who's doing the action actually gets to participate
[time=1890] or benefit from the action that he does.
[time=1894] In other words, if I spend time washing my car, I get to take the benefit of that.
[time=1901] I get to drive around in a freshly washed car and have the feeling of that experience.
[time=1908] If I washed your car, I wouldn't get to participate in that, right?
[time=1913] I have to wash my car.
[time=1914] It's more of a reflexive.
[time=1917] The subject performs an action upon himself or herself for their own benefit.
[time=1923] That's what this verse is talking.
[time=1925] That's why it's more personal.
[time=1927] He says take hold of the eternal life.
[time=1931] It's a command.
[time=1932] It's an urgent.
[time=1933] So that word take hold of means this.
[time=1934] It's taking possession.
[time=1936] It means bringing it close.
[time=1937] I think a great way to understand this is the marriage vows and what happens in a wedding.
[time=1945] Just shy of 20 years ago, I stood on this very platform and married my wife Paula.
[time=1951] And Russell Moore, who was the pastor, performed that ceremony.
[time=1955] And at one point in this, he said, Josh, do you take Paula to be your wedded wife?
[time=1963] What's he saying there?
[time=1966] But I'm going to steal her away that I'm going to somehow just kind of snatch her away from Bill and Marilyn Tripplet, who are parents.
[time=1973] No.
[time=1974] That I am going to take possession.
[time=1978] That I'm going to bring her, there's an intimacy in this word.
[time=1982] There's a closeness in this word.
[time=1984] There's an idea of possession, of bringing it close, that now this woman who was under the authority of her father has now come close to me, that I would take hold and take possession.
[time=1995] And now she would be a part of me and under my authority.
[time=2002] And there's this intimacy in this word.
[time=2004] There's a taking possession of it.
[time=2011] Another quick picture that might be helpful in Jesus with Peter and Matthew 14, remember he's walking on the water and he gets scared.
[time=2020] He takes his eyes off Jesus when he saw the wind that says in verse 30, he was afraid and beginning to seek to sink.
[time=2027] He cried out, Lord, save me.
[time=2030] Jesus reached out his hand and guess what he did?
[time=2035] He took hold.
[time=2038] Same word.
[time=2039] He said, I've got you.
[time=2041] You're my possession.
[time=2042] I'm going to bring you close.
[time=2044] I'm going to care for you and take care of you.
[time=2047] I'm going to bring you in.
[time=2052] Paul's instructing Timothy to take hold of this eternal life.
[time=2060] Well, what's this eternal life that he's talking about?
[time=2062] Eternal life certainly is a quantity of life for sure, that we will be with him forever
[time=2068] into eternity, worshiping the lamb who was slain, the great I am, the sovereign power
[time=2074] who was willingly bound for our sakes and for his glory.
[time=2078] Certainly that concept, but also a quality of life that God gives us here and now.
[time=2085] John 10, 10 says this, the thief which is Satan comes only to steal and kill and destroy,
[time=2092] but I came, Jesus said, that they may have life and have it abundantly.
[time=2100] That abundant simply means more than something further superior, uncommon, more remarkable
[time=2107] out of this world.
[time=2110] It's not nearly enough to say that God's commands are for our good or that his instructions yield
[time=2117] peace and that when we obey, he gives us joy or obedience means that it will go well with
[time=2124] us.
[time=2125] Listen, there is no comparison to the benefits that we receive from what God has prescribed
[time=2132] for us, there's no comparison to what this world might try to offer us.
[time=2138] His abundant life is otherworldly.
[time=2147] This eternal life though is not ours to take, is it?
[time=2151] We don't have any claim on it.
[time=2154] We don't have any right for it.
[time=2157] It's not that we could somehow earn it, but God has secured it for us through the death
[time=2164] and resurrection of Jesus.
[time=2168] So watch this when we bring it all together.
[time=2170] When we take hold of this eternal life, when we in a very intimate and personal way take
[time=2176] possession and grab hold of the reality of God's grace to us, we get to participate in
[time=2184] the benefits of it and live in all that God has for us.
[time=2191] This is what we mean when we say to live in the good of the gospel.
[time=2197] You see when we wash the car, we get to benefit from our action by riding in the comfort and feeling of a freshly washed car.
[time=2204] When we take hold of the eternal life, we get to benefit from our action by realizing
[time=2212] and experiencing all that comes with this life that God has secured for us.
[time=2221] Paul says to Timothy, oh, Timothy, take hold of this with great urgency.
[time=2230] It's been secured for you.
[time=2234] It's not as easy as it sounds though, is it?
[time=2237] Milton Vincent in his little book called The Gospel Primer said this, "It is simply hard to believe the full scope of the gospel." It's hard on a daily basis to believe that he loves us so much that he would die for
[time=2252] us and that my performance has nothing to do with that.
[time=2258] It's hard to believe.
[time=2259] Yes, God has secured this for us, but notice that we must grab a hold of it.
[time=2267] It's our responsibility.
[time=2273] So with this in mind, Paul gives Timothy five helps, five helps to taking hold of this eternal
[time=2282] life.
[time=2283] We'll try to go through them very, very quickly.
[time=2285] The first is this, he says in verse 12, "Take hold of the eternal life to which you were
[time=2291] called." The first help is this, "Know that you were called."
[time=2299] Timothy is addressed in this section, not by his name, but by the reality of God's take
[time=2307] on who he is.
[time=2308] Look at verse 11, "But as for you," and notice it doesn't say, "Timothy, does it?
[time=2314] But as for you," in verse 11, "Oh man of God."
[time=2322] See what Paul's doing there?
[time=2326] In the midst of all that Timothy has going on, being unsure of himself, being timid,
[time=2335] having some sort of stomach ailment, having all the pressures that come with him leading
[time=2342] that church, Paul reminds him, "You are God's man."
[time=2350] It doesn't matter how you feel.
[time=2354] God has called you.
[time=2357] You're his man.
[time=2360] Timothy, in the midst of your duties, remember, you're God's man.
[time=2367] He's called you.
[time=2370] And today, in the midst of your duties, in the midst of what you have going on, remember you're God's man, you're God's woman.
[time=2379] He's called you.
[time=2382] You know, only a few people in the Old Testament were called man of God.
[time=2386] Moses was called God's man.
[time=2390] Samuel was called the man of God.
[time=2392] David, King David was called the man of God.
[time=2396] Elijah, the prophet, was called the man of God.
[time=2399] Elisha, who came after Elijah, was called the man of God.
[time=2403] That's roughly it.
[time=2406] And yet something wonderful has happened now in the New Testament because of what Christ has done, that when we look at 2 Timothy, chapter 3, that says, "All Scripture is God
[time=2417] breathed," right?
[time=2418] And is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training, and righteousness.
[time=2422] That what, the man of God, may be thoroughly equipped.
[time=2429] We could put the woman of God.
[time=2431] You see, in the New Testament, all those who have placed their faith and trust in Christ.
[time=2438] You're God's man.
[time=2442] He's called you.
[time=2447] You know that you were called, Timothy, despite how you feel and how you are in your natural
[time=2454] flesh in Christ.
[time=2457] You're God's man.
[time=2459] Second, help.
[time=2460] Be reminded of your confession.
[time=2462] Look at what it says in verse 12, "Take hold of the eternal life to what you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses." You see, a Christian is someone who has come to a conclusion regarding who Christ is.
[time=2479] We're in process on a lot of things, right?
[time=2482] I'm in process of my parenting.
[time=2485] I'm in process of my marriage.
[time=2489] I'm in process of all sorts of things.
[time=2492] God's sanctifying work in me is moving me closer and closer and closer, hopefully, to
[time=2498] the person of Christ.
[time=2501] We are a people in process and yet our confession is not a process.
[time=2510] It's done.
[time=2511] I have confessed that Jesus is the Christ, similar to Peter.
[time=2518] When Jesus says, "Who do you say that I am?" And he says, "You are the Christ," or Thomas, who said, "My Lord and my God," and even Jesus,
[time=2530] as it says, before Pontius Pilate, when Pilate says, "Are you the king of the Jews?"
[time=2536] And Jesus responds, "It is," as you say.
[time=2541] He is the king.
[time=2543] He is the Savior.
[time=2545] He is the only one who can save.
[time=2549] And I have confessed, and I know many of you have confessed that he truly is your king
[time=2557] and your Savior and your Lord.
[time=2560] Remember your confession.
[time=2563] Go back to the wedding ceremony, remember?
[time=2568] I perform wedding ceremonies now, and there's the bride in the groom, and then there's sometimes
[time=2574] a long train of people, right?
[time=2575] And what are they there for?
[time=2578] They're there to be a witness.
[time=2581] And so, when I talk to that bride in the groom and I say, "Listen, you've communicated some very important vows to one another.
[time=2588] I pray that you will remember them, but when you don't, I hope that these people here who have heard what you've communicated to each other will hold you accountable to those vows."
[time=2598] It's the same thing we do with our confession.
[time=2600] That's why I think baptism is such a significant truth.
[time=2606] It doesn't save us, but it's a declaration about my conclusion of who Christ is in front
[time=2612] of the world.
[time=2614] And so, when I confess that before men, I hope that you would keep me accountable to that confession.
[time=2620] And as I try to fight the good fight of faith, oh, I hope that I would remember my confession,
[time=2628] my conclusion about who Christ is.
[time=2630] That's the second one.
[time=2631] The third is this, to keep the commandment unstained.
[time=2634] It comes in verses 13 and 14.
[time=2636] He says, "I charge you in the presence of God who gives life to all and of Christ Jesus, to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach."
[time=2648] That word commandment could mean a lot of things.
[time=2650] It could mean the Old Testament law.
[time=2651] It could be the prescriptions given to Timothy in this letter.
[time=2655] I think because of the context of first Timothy, I think it's talking about the gospel.
[time=2662] I believe the purity of the gospel is what this is speaking about, that as we try to
[time=2669] fight the good fight of faith, that we would keep the gospel truth pure and undiluted and unstained.
[time=2676] You see, the gospel, while it is as deep as any topic that you can talk about, it is
[time=2682] at the same time as simple as anything to grasp.
[time=2688] And yet, it gets distorted.
[time=2690] It got distorted in Timothy's day.
[time=2693] In chapter one, he was called to instruct certain men not to teach a different doctrine.
[time=2699] In chapter four, he said that there were people that were adding rules and regulations to the gospel.
[time=2706] In chapter six, this different doctrine comes from one who's puffed up and conceded and imagines that his own godliness is a source of great gain.
[time=2717] You see, there are distortions today as well, but the gospel is a simple message.
[time=2724] Chapter one, 15, Paul says this, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.
[time=2732] Boy, we could go deep on that.
[time=2738] We could go really deep.
[time=2739] And yet at the same time, it's so easy and so simple to understand.
[time=2748] That I in my pride choose to go my own way and sin against my Creator and yet God in
[time=2756] his grace sent his son Jesus to come to this earth and to die on a cross and to pay the penalty for my sin and give me his perfect righteousness so that when God looks at me, I'm accepted, not because of anything I could ever do, but because of the very grace of God, the simple message of the gospel.
[time=2777] Chapter two, verse five and six, for there's one God and there's one mediator between God
[time=2783] and man, the man Christ Jesus who gave himself as a ransom for all.
[time=2789] It's a simple message.
[time=2792] And so Paul says to Timothy, in order to take hold of this eternal life, keep the message of the gospel undiluted, pure, simple, fourth help quickly comes in verses 15 and 16.
[time=2806] It's talking about seeing Christ clearly.
[time=2809] You see when we face the temptations and lies of this world, nothing will help us see through those lies more than a clear picture of Christ.
[time=2820] This section verses 15 and 16, I think, is one of the most beautiful and powerful descriptions of our Lord Jesus.
[time=2829] Goes back to Hebrews 11, actually Hebrews 12, the end of the faith chapter, when it says
[time=2835] this, "Since we're surrounded by so great a cloud of witness, let us lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily encumbers us and let us run with endurance, the race set before us looking to Jesus or our eyes fixed on Jesus."
[time=2853] You see here?
[time=2854] The one who has called you and is coming again to claim you is the only sovereign.
[time=2862] There is no true, there is no other sovereign, there is no other ruler, there is no other king, he is the only sovereign and he will and is ruling and reigning and that will happen
[time=2876] forever and ever and ever.
[time=2878] He is the only sovereign, he says there, he's the king of kings, he's the Lord of lords, he is immortal, the grave could not hold him.
[time=2887] And he's there, it says in unapproachable light, notice that it's not, he's not veiled in darkness, he can be seen, he's not trying to hide himself, it's not clouded, he's there
[time=2907] in the light but it's unapproachable light because that light is the beauty of his glory
[time=2913] and holiness that no one can approach without the grace that he can give.
[time=2919] It's an amazing description of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2925] And notice here that it says that he is coming, that he is going to be appearing.
[time=2930] So what that means is this, that faith will become sight, we will see him and we will
[time=2936] be with him forever and ever.
[time=2941] Fifth help, don't hope in this earth, verses 17 through 19, instruction for those who are rich in a subtle sense, I think it addresses all of us here today, for we're all rich in
[time=2953] this world.
[time=2954] But notice the emphasis, we don't have a lot of time this morning but there's an emphasis, there's an emphasis on placing your hope on the right thing and doing that with humility.
[time=2965] So first of all, riches are uncertain and while they promise much in the end they only
[time=2971] deliver for a short time but look at the contrast in verse 19.
[time=2978] He says, store up treasure for yourselves as a good foundation for the future so that you may take hold of the same word, that which is truly life.
[time=2988] See verse 19 stands in contrast to the world's concept of truly living because in the end
[time=2994] the world really has nothing for us.
[time=2998] Back to Psalm 16, 11, you have shown me the path of life, that which is truly life.
[time=3004] In your presence is fullness of joy and at your right hand there are pleasures forever.
[time=3011] Second, there's a proper perspective on riches that the riches can only come with the recognition that they're really God's blessing and provision.
[time=3020] Notice what it says, it's God who richly wordplay provides us with everything to enjoy.
[time=3028] So the first command in fighting the good fight of the faith is to take hold of the
[time=3034] life that God has secured for us through the gospel.
[time=3037] We can do this by knowing that we're called, we're God's man, remembering our confession,
[time=3043] keeping the gospel pure, seeing Christ clearly and not hoping in this world that leads to our second command, which we'll spend about three to five minutes on, and then we'll
[time=3054] be done this morning.
[time=3056] The second command in verse 20, guard the deposit.
[time=3059] Remember I told you that first command, they both have a sense of urgency, that first was more kind of micro, it was personal, that Timothy actually participated in those things.
[time=3070] This is much more corporate and global.
[time=3073] It's the idea of what we do here by guarding the gospel.
[time=3078] It has a benefit for the world, because the world needs to hear the gospel.
[time=3083] The world needs the good news, and we have an opportunity to advance God's kingdom by
[time=3089] delivering the good news of the gospel to those who desperately need it.
[time=3093] Here again, go back to the Greek, this is an herist, it's not a middle voice, it's an
[time=3099] active voice, but there's still this herist imperative, it's a command that says, do this now, at once and once for all.
[time=3111] Definition there of guard, we understand that, just to keep watch.
[time=3116] Never lose sight of it, keep safe, we understand that.
[time=3119] That idea of deposit is something to give, something given to someone for safe keeping.
[time=3125] In this context, in this respect, it's talking about the gospel.
[time=3130] One commentator said this.
[time=3132] This word is used of the correct knowledge and pure doctrine of the gospel to be held firmly and faithfully and to be conscientiously delivered unto others.
[time=3145] You see, this is what Paul was entrusted with in 1 Timothy 1, 11, and now in turn he entrusted to Timothy, the most precious treasure of mankind, the hope of the world.
[time=3158] Paul and trusted now to Timothy and said, oh, Timothy, guard this treasure so that you
[time=3166] in turn will be able to pass it to other faithful men, so that now today, you and I who no Christ
[time=3174] and trust him, now we have this same command to guard what has been entrusted to us, to
[time=3187] bring it together again, this idea is this, that Paul is with great urgency and passion, telling Timothy, don't loosen your grip on the gospel.
[time=3199] Don't fumble it.
[time=3202] The world desperately needs to hear this good news of salvation in Jesus Christ.
[time=3209] Again, it's not as easily done as said, and so Paul quickly gives two thoughts there.
[time=3215] He says to avoid the talk, avoid the talk.
[time=3221] He calls it a reverent babble in contradictions of what's falsely called knowledge.
[time=3226] This is just going back to discussions about vain and empty matters, discussions that have no substance, they're base or worldly, it's just filling the air with words, goes back to the tower of Babel where we get that word, Babel.
[time=3240] Again, just this idea there that they were there, they were those there who wanted to reach God on their own, their own effort, and so God just confused their language and
[time=3252] all that they heard was just this battle sound, it was for their own personal achievement,
[time=3260] goes back again these ideas of just the endless myths and genealogies that are all throughout
[time=3266] first Timothy, so he says, avoid that.
[time=3271] And then lastly, he says this, we'll ask four words, grace be with you, go with grace.
[time=3278] Grace, the constant companion of a man or woman of God.
[time=3286] Grace for our daily needs, grace to believe, grace to obey, grace to repent, grace for others,
[time=3293] the same grace we receive is the same grace we can give to others.
[time=3300] So in conclusion, Paul's words to Timothy are just as true to us today, fight the good
[time=3309] fight of the faith.
[time=3312] This fight centers on a belief, a belief that certainly impacts even dictates our behavior.
[time=3318] This fight is all about believing who God is and what He's done and living your life
[time=3324] in the good of all that God has secured for His people through the work of His Son and the power of His Spirit.
[time=3330] So I just ask you this morning, what are you choosing to believe about God these days?
[time=3338] What are you choosing to believe these days?
[time=3342] What is it that's rattling around up in your head these days?
[time=3350] What are you focusing on?
[time=3351] What are you thinking through and what kind of beliefs are up there?
[time=3360] Are you living in the good of His gospel?
[time=3364] Are you experiencing His presence in your life?
[time=3367] Are you reveling in your adoption by the King?
[time=3371] Are you experiencing His forgiveness?
[time=3373] Do you sense His grace in your obedience?
[time=3378] Are you believing correctly about God?
[time=3383] He is good.
[time=3384] He does love you.
[time=3385] He is just.
[time=3386] He's just enough to send His Son to die for us.
[time=3393] He does care.
[time=3396] He is there.
[time=3398] He's present.
[time=3401] What are you believing these days about God?
[time=3403] If not, if you're not believing those things, if you're struggling there, I want to encourage you today, take hold.
[time=3413] It's been secured for you.
[time=3416] Take hold.
[time=3418] Bring it close.
[time=3419] Take possession.
[time=3421] Draw it in the eternal life that God has secured for you.
[time=3425] Take possession of it.
[time=3427] Bring these truths close.
[time=3431] You, man of God, woman of God, you've been called by Him.
[time=3439] Remember your confession about Christ.
[time=3442] Keep the gospel pure.
[time=3443] See Christ clearly.
[time=3446] Don't put your hope in this world.
[time=3450] And then guard the deposit.
[time=3453] Don't loosen your grasp on the gospel.
[time=3458] Realize your opportunity to advance the kingdom of God as He has entrusted us with His gospel
[time=3466] for the world.
[time=3470] And then just finally, grace be with you.
[time=3477] Grace be with you this morning.
[time=3480] God thank you so much.
[time=3482] Thank you for communicating your word to us.
[time=3484] Thank you that you are a God who richly provides all things for us to enjoy.
[time=3491] You're a God who gives life to all things.
[time=3494] You're a God who has secured for your people a life that is eternal, that is abundant.
[time=3503] And what you've called us to, you've given us resources to accomplish.
[time=3509] And so, God, this morning, I just ask that you would confirm these things in our hearts and in our minds.
[time=3515] If there's anybody here this morning that hasn't made a confession about you, I pray that they this morning would come to a conclusion about who you are, Christ.
[time=3527] O Spirit, would you work in each and every one of our hearts this morning?
[time=3533] In Christ's name we pray, amen.
