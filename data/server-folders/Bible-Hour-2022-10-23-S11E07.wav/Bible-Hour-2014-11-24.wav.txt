[time=218] [MUSIC]
[time=221] A flood for my soul.

[time=223] A flood for my soul.
[time=225] A well that never will run dry.
[time=229] [MUSIC]
[time=232] I've rambled on my own.

[time=366] [AMEN] That's great.
[time=368] Sing it.
[time=371] You may be seated.
[time=377] Well good morning everyone and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=381] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=382] I'm part of the team here at Black Act Ministries.
[time=384] It's a teaching pastor.
[time=386] As I talked to you this morning, we have entered the holiday season.
[time=389] Just a couple of days out from Thanksgiving and I like you and probably still full from what we just enjoyed.
[time=397] I hope that that fullness that you experienced over Thanksgiving was a complete fullness of time with family, time with friends around the table.
[time=407] What a great time of rejoicing.
[time=409] This morning as the Thanksgiving season is now in our rear view mirror and we enter the Christmas season, these words are ringing in my ears today.
[time=418] The Psalm that says, "Give thanks to the Lord for He is good.
[time=423] His love endures forever." The world that we live in is filled with transient things.
[time=430] Things that come and things that go.
[time=432] But I am comforted and I trust you would be to you this morning by the goodness of God that will never stop.
[time=440] His love towards us will endure forever.
[time=443] There's nothing that will ever interfere with it from his end.
[time=446] Our affections, they're here today.
[time=450] They're gone tomorrow but God's love toward us is everlasting.
[time=454] And this morning I would encourage you with that Christmas season, the month of December is just a few days away as I broadcast this with you this morning.
[time=465] We'll be in December.
[time=466] And this morning I want to encourage you with that truth, that whatever Christmas represents for you, maybe it's a hard season of the year for you because of the loss or because of whatever reason.
[time=476] I encourage you with this today.
[time=478] The Christmas, whatever else it means to you, it means that God has come to be with us and it means that God's love demonstrated in the person of his son is available for you every single day.
[time=490] I encourage you with that today.
[time=492] Spurning on the broadcast you're going to hear from a good friend of mine, Steve Lombreich, who's going to take a journey back through our time in First Timothy and sort of give us a summary statement of all the things that we've talked about.
[time=503] No small task for Steve be just the man to do it.
[time=507] To do it grateful for him for his years of faithful service in this place to the church and the school.
[time=514] As I speak with you this morning, there's Christmas trees all over the campus here at Black Oc.
[time=519] We just invite you as we always do as part of our family to come and see.
[time=524] Come and see in person.
[time=525] We've got great things lined up for the month of December.
[time=527] We've got children's musicals.
[time=528] We've got drama.
[time=529] We've got music from our choir and from our musicians.
[time=533] So very much to share with you on so many fronts.
[time=536] We're very excited about this time of the year.
[time=540] It's the most wonderful time of the year because it's a chance for us to talk in a very concentrated and in a very intentional way about Jesus, who is the reason why all these things are here in the first place.
[time=553] We have these built-in conversations everywhere we go about him and celebration of his birth that God has come to be with us.
[time=561] Would you come be with us in the coming weeks?
[time=563] Come and celebrate with us.
[time=565] Come and let us be an encouragement to you as you are an encouragement to us by watching the program.
[time=570] Thank you so much.
[time=571] Again, I pray that this season is a time of great encouragement for you, remembering that God has come to be with us and that He is a name.
[time=579] That name is Jesus.
[time=580] Have a great week.
[time=594] Sing Christ is my reward.
[time=596] [MUSIC] Christ is my reward and all my devotion [MUSIC]
[time=609] [MUSIC]
[time=616] [MUSIC] Through every trial my soul will sing [MUSIC] No turning back [MUSIC] I've been set free [MUSIC] Christ is enough for me [MUSIC] Christ is enough for me [MUSIC] Everything I need is in you [MUSIC] You're everything I need [MUSIC] Christ is my all in all [MUSIC] Joy my salvation [MUSIC] And this hope will never fail [MUSIC] Heaven is our home [MUSIC] Every storm's here [MUSIC] Through every storm [MUSIC] My soul is in Jesus is here [MUSIC] To God be the glory [MUSIC] Christ is enough for me [MUSIC] Christ is enough for me [MUSIC] Everything I need is in you [MUSIC] You're everything I need [MUSIC] Christ is enough for me [MUSIC] Christ is enough for me [MUSIC] Everything I need is in you [MUSIC] You're everything I need [MUSIC] I have decided to follow Jesus [MUSIC] No turning back [MUSIC] No turning back [MUSIC] I have decided to follow Jesus [MUSIC] There's no turning back [MUSIC] No turning back [MUSIC] Cross before me [MUSIC] The world behind me [MUSIC] No turning back [MUSIC] No turning back [MUSIC] The cross before me [MUSIC] The world behind me [MUSIC] No turning back [MUSIC] No turning back [MUSIC] Christ is enough [MUSIC] Christ is enough for me [MUSIC] Christ is enough for me [MUSIC] Everything I need is in you [MUSIC] You're everything I need [MUSIC] Christ is enough for me [MUSIC] Christ is enough for me [MUSIC] Everything I need is in you [MUSIC] You're everything I need [MUSIC] I have decided [MUSIC] I have decided to follow Jesus [MUSIC] No turning back [MUSIC] No turning back [MUSIC] I have decided to follow Jesus [MUSIC] No turning back [MUSIC] No turning back [MUSIC] No turning back [MUSIC] I have seen take my life [MUSIC] Take my life [MUSIC] I lay it down [MUSIC] At the cross [MUSIC] Where I am found [MUSIC] All I have I [MUSIC] Get to you again [MUSIC] Take my hands [MUSIC] Take my hands [MUSIC] And make them clean [MUSIC] Keep my heart [MUSIC] In purity [MUSIC] That I may walk in [MUSIC] All you have for me [MUSIC] Ooh [MUSIC] Here I stand on open wine [MUSIC] Ooh [MUSIC] I am yours [MUSIC] And you are mine [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] Take my moments [MUSIC] Take my moments [MUSIC] And my days [MUSIC] Let each breath [MUSIC] That I take [MUSIC] Be ever only [MUSIC] For you, O God [MUSIC] Here I stand [MUSIC] Ooh [MUSIC] Here I stand on open wine [MUSIC] Ooh [MUSIC] I am yours [MUSIC] And you are mine [MUSIC] Yes, Lord [MUSIC] Ooh [MUSIC] Here I stand, our open wide [MUSIC] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [MUSIC] I am yours, you are mine [MUSIC] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [MUSIC] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [MUSIC] My whole life is yours as I give it all [MUSIC] Surrender to your name [MUSIC] And forever I will sing [MUSIC] Have your way, have your way [MUSIC] My whole life is yours as I give it all [MUSIC] Surrender to your name [MUSIC] And forever I will sing [MUSIC] Have your way, have your way [MUSIC] Have your way [MUSIC] Have your way, have your way [MUSIC] Have your way [MUSIC] Where I stand, oh, oh [MUSIC] Here I stand, our open wide [MUSIC] Oh, oh, oh, oh [MUSIC] I am yours, you are mine [MUSIC] Oh, oh, oh, oh [MUSIC] Here I stand, arms open wide [MUSIC] Oh, oh, oh, oh [MUSIC] I am yours, you are mine [MUSIC] Jesus ♪
[time=1149] - God, we do stand before you today.
[time=1156] I'm more singing out of arms open wide.
[time=1160] It means that we want to,
[time=1167] we want to take in as much of you as possible, God.
[time=1170] At the same time, God help us to also,
[time=1176] with the same wide open arms to surrender, as much of us as possible, God.
[time=1183] God help us to take small steps.
[time=1188] I know it's not easy, too, to bear ourselves and to give ourselves up and say that we want to be like you in every area, God.
[time=1198] It's not easy, I wouldn't be honest to say that that's exactly what we want when the first thing in the morning, we wake up every day, God, but please help us to help that to be the true cry of our heart.
[time=1210] I want those arms open wide, God, to take in all of you that we can and to same time give up to you as much as we can.
[time=1220] I don't mind knowing anymore, it's a new name we pray, amen.
[time=1225] - Advent.
[time=1233] Advent is an arrival, an appearance of something noteworthy.
[time=1238] We use the word to describe all kinds of things
[time=1249] that have happened in the past and then in this season, in the church, for centuries, the church has been celebrating the four Sundays before Christmas in anticipation of the most noteworthy arrival in the history of the world.
[time=1268] The Lord Jesus himself.
[time=1272] I love the fact that that song ended with his name, what a great way to start Advent.
[time=1278] The appearance, the arrival of someone noteworthy.
[time=1284] He's worthy of our notice.
[time=1288] He's the most worthy one of all.
[time=1291] - Amen. - Yes.
[time=1293] Father in heaven, we bow down to you the God most high,
[time=1300] the maker and creator and sustainer of everything.
[time=1305] And we focus our attention this morning
[time=1311] at the beginning of this sermon on the Lord Jesus and his appearance.
[time=1319] And Lord, everything in First Timothy, everything in the Old Testament, every word written, focuses on the centrality of the cross of Christ, his birth, his death and his resurrection.
[time=1336] And God, we thank you, we praise you, we give you our attention.
[time=1342] He is noteworthy, you are the noteworthy one.
[time=1347] And so we proclaim, our hope is in you.
[time=1352] Please help us understand what it is you want us to learn this morning.
[time=1357] And please receive our praise, our love, our adoration.
[time=1362] Please, in Christ's name I pray, amen.
[time=1366] Well, it is good to be home.
[time=1371] Nancy and I have been away for about 14 months.
[time=1376] At Woodburn Missionary Church, a wonderful, godly group of people, the body is alive and well in Woodburn.
[time=1385] And they found their new pastor after this, I guess it was about a 16 month search.
[time=1392] And so last week was his first week.
[time=1395] And Nancy and I got to sit right back there and just enjoy being home.
[time=1399] And for some of you who don't know me, this has been home since 1979 for me.
[time=1404] So it really was homecoming for me.
[time=1408] And this morning is two.
[time=1410] I'm so thankful that I get a chance to be up here and be with you this morning.
[time=1414] What I've been asked to do is review what's been taught from First Timothy.
[time=1421] So that was 12 messages.
[time=1423] So we will be here a while today.
[time=1425] (audience laughs) I'm gonna, I'm probably the best in the place at stopping when that clock ticks down.
[time=1431] So you don't have to worry about that.
[time=1435] (audience laughs) It was really good for me to review all those messages.
[time=1442] They did such a fine job, Josh and Steve and Jesse and Rod and Rick.
[time=1449] I was so good.
[time=1452] And so I'm just gonna touch on each of their messages to review First Timothy with you.
[time=1460] I think I'll introduce it this way though.
[time=1463] I didn't do this first service, but.
[time=1465] When I bumped into Timothy in my life, I was reading through the book of Acts.
[time=1474] I think I was probably 25, 26 years old.
[time=1478] And I was reading through Acts and I read Acts chapter 15.
[time=1483] And in Acts 15, Paul had come from Antioch down to Jerusalem
[time=1492] to debate with Peter and James, the leaders of the church there in Jerusalem.
[time=1499] He was debating with them because they'd been teaching that the Gentiles had to become Jews in order to become Christians.
[time=1506] They had to become people who kept the law.
[time=1510] The men had to get circumcised.
[time=1512] They had to keep the rules that the Jews had been keeping, the laws that God had ordained.
[time=1518] And Paul, by the Holy Spirit, came down to debate with Peter and James.
[time=1525] And Peter and James yielded and the church there in Jerusalem decided that no, Gentiles didn't have to become Jews first.
[time=1534] They didn't have to get circumcised in order to be Christians.
[time=1537] And I was thinking when I read that as an adult man in the first century thinking about not having to get circumcised, my thought was like, (congregation laughing) and then in Acts chapter 16, the very first thing that happens is, Paul approaches Timothy and he says to Timothy, I want you to go with me on this missionary journey.
[time=1566] Your dad's a Greek, you haven't been circumcised.
[time=1570] I want you to get circumcised because we're gonna go minister to Jews.
[time=1577] Doesn't say much more about that.
[time=1579] Timothy just did it.
[time=1582] He had a mother and a grandmother who were godly women and they had taught him the things of the scriptures.
[time=1588] But he hadn't been circumcised and he wasn't Jewish.
[time=1592] And Paul said, I want you to get circumcised.
[time=1594] We're gonna go minister to Jews.
[time=1596] That could be a stumbling block is my interpretation of that.
[time=1599] It doesn't say that there.
[time=1601] And I know that particular passage in Acts isn't really about a principle for me to live by, but I still grabbed one out of it.
[time=1611] And I'm not telling you that you have to grab this principle at all.
[time=1615] I'm just telling you that when I bumped into Timothy, it changed my life.
[time=1620] Because I decided then, and I've had to live it out
[time=1626] a few times.
[time=1627] I decided then that I was going to stop doing
[time=1633] whatever I needed to stop doing in whatever environment I was in in order to minister to people and share the gospel.
[time=1641] Whatever was gonna broaden that, if I need to stop something in order to broaden it, I was gonna stop it.
[time=1646] If I needed to start something and do something different, I was going to do that.
[time=1652] So I was gonna go through the doors that opened up that made it possible for me to either broaden impact for the kingdom because the rest of it is a vapor, you know?
[time=1664] It's a mist, it's a twinkle,
[time=1670] but the kingdom forever, forever.
[time=1674] So I decided I was gonna do that.
[time=1676] I was in Worthington at the time.
[time=1677] I wasn't allowed to have a beard.
[time=1682] They didn't want people that worked for the church and the school to have a beard at that time.
[time=1687] There were some rules like that in those days.
[time=1689] I came over here and I was being interviewed
[time=1696] in the library across the street.
[time=1697] Dale, I bet you were there.
[time=1699] And I had a beard because at Worthington, they changed the rules and the last year I was there for about six months, I was allowed to have a beard.
[time=1709] And then David Jeremiah and some guys over here were interviewing me, Dale, one of them.
[time=1714] And they asked me, if I'd be willing to shave my beard.
[time=1718] 'Cause we had a rule at that time here that the people on the staff and in the school shouldn't have a beard.
[time=1723] The men shouldn't have facial hair.
[time=1725] Why?
[time=1725] Who knows?
[time=1726] Doesn't matter.
[time=1727] (audience laughing) Doesn't matter.
[time=1729] And so Howard Mayes, I remember, asked me if I'd be willing to shave my beard.
[time=1735] And I said yes.
[time=1738] I said it quickly because, you know what?
[time=1741] I decided when I read Acts chapter 16 that when that stuff came up, I wasn't going to hang on to something I wanted to keep me from having an opportunity for ministry.
[time=1752] I've also had the freedom to do some things
[time=1760] that other people wouldn't be willing to do in order to broaden my ministry.
[time=1766] I get a lot of amens on the shaving the beard off.
[time=1768] I don't get a lot of amens on being willing to do some things that would fit in a culture like that.
[time=1772] You have to be discerning to do that.
[time=1774] You see, I think God wants us in the body of Christ to struggle in the stress and the tension that comes with trying to figure out how we fit in this context to build the kingdom.
[time=1785] It isn't a list of rules spelled out very clearly.
[time=1790] So I know I don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[time=1793] And I do, do, do, no, that's not there.
[time=1796] The New Testament's filled with tension.
[time=1800] That God, I believe wants me to live in so that I'm utterly dependent on Him.
[time=1804] It also has a lot of absolutes in it that some denominations slip away from.
[time=1811] And you know who they become?
[time=1812] They become the people who are reasonable.
[time=1816] You remember what Rod Ovid said, "I just loved it in sermon." He said, "Satan masquerades as a master of reasonableness."
[time=1827] Because much of what's outside the absolutes of the scripture seem more reasonable to men.
[time=1834] And I don't want to be involved in that either.
[time=1839] I don't want more restriction that I should have and I don't want more liberty than I should have.
[time=1843] God has me functioning in between there in a tension filled relationship with Him where I'm discerning what the Spirit of God is saying to me through the Word of God in the circumstances that I'm in and it's different in different places and you have to be mature enough to do that.
[time=1859] And I need to yield to the elders who discern some things at some times.
[time=1865] Need to be a little tighter than I'd want 'em to be or maybe a little looser than I'd want 'em to be.
[time=1871] And Rick Rayward did a great job working in through that passage there in 1 Timothy 3 describing the character.
[time=1879] And then in the second part of that, Josh did for deacons.
[time=1884] We'll walk through that in a second.
[time=1887] Powerful.
[time=1888] I bumped into Timothy and a principle that I believe God gave for me.
[time=1893] I'm not telling you for a minute that this is clearly a principle for you.
[time=1897] That's not what Acts 16 is about.
[time=1900] It's about the story of what took place between Timothy and Paul and going on that missionary journey together.
[time=1906] But for me, what God did for me is I discerned the scriptures.
[time=1910] Was he said, "Steve, be like Timothy." I remember Howard or Dale or somebody also said, "Would you shave your legs?" (congregation laughs) And I said, "Yes." And I would have.
[time=1925] Shaved legs or no shaved legs.
[time=1929] Don't matter.
[time=1930] He matters.
[time=1934] He matters forever.
[time=1936] And the extent to which he makes it possible for us to live his will out in us, that's what matters.
[time=1943] Josh, in the first sermon,
[time=1950] he said that the theme of the book of 1 Timothy
[time=1956] is in chapter three verses 14 and 15.
[time=1961] I loved it.
[time=1963] This isn't all of it, but this is some of it.
[time=1964] He says, "I write these instructions "so that you will know how people should conduct themselves." God cares about the behavior in the household of God.
[time=1974] And that's not talking about this building.
[time=1978] I'm adopted into the household of God.
[time=1983] You are my brothers and my sisters.
[time=1987] If you've been adopted and you've believed and you've received Christ as your savior, we're in the household of God together.
[time=1994] I'm in the household of God with those people from Woodburn.
[time=1996] I'm in the household of God with every believer in the world.
[time=2000] And he says that I should conduct myself properly
[time=2007] as part of that household.
[time=2009] My father gets to set the standard and he wants me to conduct myself appropriately.
[time=2014] He says in the household of God, which is the church, the body of Christ.
[time=2022] He says it's a pillar and a buttress of truth.
[time=2025] I believe it is.
[time=2026] So the theme is, I need to believe what's true.
[time=2035] He's revealed it to us, what we need to know.
[time=2039] All of truth isn't in here, you know?
[time=2042] Everything he's done isn't in here.
[time=2044] All the truth I need is in here.
[time=2046] And he wants me to conduct myself in a manner aligned to the beliefs that I grow to believe.
[time=2055] I'm not born with the beliefs.
[time=2058] And he wants me to understand what he thinks I should believe.
[time=2063] You know, his ways are higher than our ways.
[time=2067] Isaiah 55 says, he says, for my thoughts aren't your thoughts.
[time=2071] It's what God's saying to us.
[time=2073] My ways aren't your ways.
[time=2075] As the heavens are higher than the earth, my ways are not your ways and your thoughts are not my thoughts.
[time=2082] I want to know his thoughts.
[time=2085] I want to know his ways.
[time=2087] I want to know what to believe.
[time=2088] And so he's revealed it to me, what I need to know.
[time=2092] He's revealed his thoughts and his ways.
[time=2094] And you know what, sometimes they don't seem reasonable.
[time=2098] And sometimes they seem less strict
[time=2104] than I think they would be.
[time=2108] And I want to behave in alignment with what he says I should believe.
[time=2113] That's what Josh said the book of First Timothy's about.
[time=2115] Paul wrote to Timothy and he said, I want you to teach the people how to conduct themselves in the household of God.
[time=2122] They need to conduct themselves on a foundation that's the buttress of truth.
[time=2128] And then Jesse said, when you tell your story,
[time=2134] he said Paul told his story there in First Timothy, chapter one, Paul told his story.
[time=2141] And then he said, but make sure you understand this, the hero in Paul's story is Christ.
[time=2147] And the hero in your story, if you know Christ is Christ.
[time=2151] And when you tell your story to other people, if he's weaved through your story, if he's the central figure in your story, then you'll have a powerful story.
[time=2163] Your story without him, I said was meaningless a little bit ago, it's meaningless.
[time=2167] Your story without him will last for a little while.
[time=2171] It's like physical exercise, Paul also tells Timothy.
[time=2175] It's good for a little while, but his story, Christ in us is good for every person on the planet forever.
[time=2184] His story in you, valuable.
[time=2187] And Jesse reminded us to make sure his story, our story is really his story.
[time=2194] He's at the center of our story.
[time=2195] And Steve Webster taught us to serve confidently,
[time=2201] pray earnestly and proclaim truthfully, serving and praying.
[time=2206] Those are behaviors that I need to do in alignment with the beliefs that I have, which is really the proclamation of the truth that I know.
[time=2214] Behavior aligned to beliefs.
[time=2217] That's what Paul said to Timothy.
[time=2219] That's what Steve said to us.
[time=2221] And then the next week, he said worship appropriately.
[time=2223] He said appropriate worship.
[time=2224] This is really a tough passage.
[time=2226] It's that second chapter passage where it's all about, oh, how do we treat women in the church?
[time=2231] How should we treat men in the church?
[time=2233] What's the right behavior?
[time=2234] He's saying, make sure you understand what appropriate worship is because appropriate worship, giving up the stuff that's not important.
[time=2243] Don't focus your attention on the physical stuff.
[time=2247] Focus all of your attention on the spiritual and worship him in spirit and truth.
[time=2253] And the impact that that has on you will cause you to have an impact on others that is catch this forever.
[time=2259] Did you hear me say forever?
[time=2261] It's forever.
[time=2263] Now that's worth something.
[time=2267] So I wanna worship him in spirit and truth appropriately so I can impact others as I've been impacted by him.
[time=2274] And then Rick Raber taught us about how to recognize elders, how to spot who they are.
[time=2280] That was so good.
[time=2282] You can spot who they are.
[time=2283] Remember aspiring to that.
[time=2284] I remember reading that for the first time and thinking, okay, God, if that's something noble, that that's what you do me to aspire to, I'm aspiring toward that.
[time=2292] And if I don't have the right teaching gift
[time=2299] or ability to teach, then I'll be deacon.
[time=2302] That's great, God, whatever it is you want from me.
[time=2304] But I wanna aspire to the qualities that are listed there in First Timothy chapter three for elders and deacons.
[time=2310] I wanna be that kind of man.
[time=2312] I love this.
[time=2319] He said, God calls his people to follow their shepherds.
[time=2324] I have experienced incredible relief when I have been struggling with the decision that doesn't seem to be just a right and wrong decision.
[time=2335] When I've gone to the elders and gotten their advice and then just did what they said, relief, getting under their authority, submitting to them, relief, it's been powerful in my life.
[time=2347] I love it.
[time=2348] And Josh said, a servant who is qualified for
[time=2355] and does daily front line ministry that supports, defends and proclaims the gospel is a deacon and a deaconess.
[time=2366] Listen to that again, a servant who is qualified for and does daily front line ministry.
[time=2371] They're ministering to people that supports, defends and proclaims the gospel.
[time=2376] That ministry supports, defends and proclaims the gospel.
[time=2380] The ministry proclaims the gospel.
[time=2382] And the words come after.
[time=2385] I love deacons and deaconesses, elders.
[time=2390] And I love flock that yields and follows well.
[time=2397] And then Rod, oh, this was so good.
[time=2399] Rod, he said, when he preached, he said that Satan was a master of reasonableness.
[time=2405] That had me.
[time=2406] I couldn't get off of it.
[time=2408] I've been talking about him for years being, he masquerades as an angel of light.
[time=2412] He masquerades as an angel of light.
[time=2417] What he tells you is this.
[time=2418] No, this is the reasonable thing to do.
[time=2421] It may not fit within what God's word clearly says, but have some reason here.
[time=2428] Listen to what other reasonable people say.
[time=2430] And Rod said, no.
[time=2434] Rod said, here are the two questions that I ask you, have you believed in Jesus?
[time=2439] Have you chosen to believe that Jesus is the Christ,
[time=2446] the son of the living God, who came to die for your sins?
[time=2449] Have you chosen that?
[time=2450] And then the second one he said was, and are you busy knowing the scriptures in order to know what you ought to believe in order to behave appropriately?
[time=2460] Do you believe Christ died for your sins?
[time=2463] And then, are you busy in the scriptures, Rod asks us?
[time=2466] Well, I remember I was in a group of people
[time=2473] and they were talking about Balaam.
[time=2476] I was about 24 years old.
[time=2478] They were talking about Balaam and Adonki in numbers.
[time=2483] And I didn't have a clue.
[time=2484] That's one of the stories that my Sunday school teachers did not tell us.
[time=2487] I don't know why, but I know I didn't know it.
[time=2491] And I remember thinking right then, I desperately need to learn what is in this book.
[time=2499] If God has revealed himself to me, shouldn't I long to know what it is that the God of heaven and earth has revealed to me about himself and about me?
[time=2511] And I remember I got the Bible and I just read the thing through.
[time=2515] And then I decided then, I'm going to study the Bible for the next 25 years.
[time=2521] I was 25 years old.
[time=2523] I decided I was going to study every single week for 25 years and see if then I'd know enough that maybe I could pastor a church.
[time=2530] That's what I was thinking then.
[time=2532] God didn't have that for me, but I did that.
[time=2535] I'll never forget I was over here and I wasn't here very long and Pastor Jeremiah said, Steve, we'd like for you to teach this Sunday school class.
[time=2546] I said, well, I'm not really ready to teach.
[time=2549] He said, yeah, you're ready to teach this class.
[time=2551] He knew what I didn't know.
[time=2553] They knew so much more than I did.
[time=2556] I was going to learn from them.
[time=2557] It was group six, I'll never forget it.
[time=2565] Yeah, Marcia Richards, dad was in there, George, Roars, Denny Roars, George Roars quoted this lengthy passage
[time=2578] from Ezekiel that fit what I was talking about.
[time=2584] And I remember thinking, oh Lord, what am I doing in here?
[time=2590] And what I was doing in there was, I was being fed by those I was teaching for a year or two.
[time=2598] They knew the word of God.
[time=2605] They had been studying it.
[time=2606] I wanted to be like that.
[time=2608] Power in this word.
[time=2614] Be busy in it.
[time=2617] Then Steve gave us three E's to live.
[time=2621] I love these, be an example, be an encouragement and demonstrate endurance.
[time=2626] That's in chapter four.
[time=2630] The last part there, 11 through 18, I think you preached on, is that right?
[time=2634] Get those three E's wrapped up in your mind.
[time=2638] The passage says it.
[time=2639] Be an example, be an encouragement and endure.
[time=2652] Then Josh opened up chapter five and he said, God will produce gospel fruit when we treat older men and younger men and older women and younger women appropriately.
[time=2665] God will open up the door for opportunity for his fruit to come in and he will proclaim his word through you as you treat them appropriately in the body.
[time=2675] Powerful passage.
[time=2682] Then Rick taught us on how we should treat elders.
[time=2686] I thought it was interesting, Rick, they gave you the first Timothy three so you did the qualifications and then you did the response on how you're supposed to treat elders, that was good.
[time=2694] He was telling you to give him double honor.
[time=2696] I don't know how that worked out.
[time=2698] Really good.
[time=2703] A call to elders are to follow God and we are to submit to our elders.
[time=2709] That makes for a healthy, energized congregation.
[time=2713] Let the elders wrestle with the changes that need to take place and yield to them while they're wrestling through it.
[time=2719] There've been a lot of changes around here over these last 30 years, 36 years that I've been here.
[time=2725] There's a lot of change.
[time=2727] The elders have wrestled through that as we make changes slowly sometimes so it doesn't rock everybody's world.
[time=2734] Yield to them.
[time=2740] Then Steve taught again in chapter six opened that up and again gave us three, it's really good.
[time=2747] Good service, sound words and godliness with contentment.
[time=2751] Good service, that's my behavior again coming out of my beliefs that I have.
[time=2755] Good service.
[time=2757] God's called us to serve one another.
[time=2759] Sound words, that's the doctrine.
[time=2764] Make sure what we say are wrapped up in and are absolutely purified by the truth that comes out of His word.
[time=2771] And then godliness with contentment.
[time=2775] Your godliness may take you out of your comfort zone and it's important for us to emphasize, to pursue contentment.
[time=2784] You know, contentment is a choice.
[time=2786] Contentment is a choice.
[time=2790] The circumstances don't dictate your contentment at all.
[time=2794] Contentment is a choice.
[time=2795] Remember Paul said in Philippians 4?
[time=2798] He said, I've learned a secret to contentment.
[time=2800] I can do all things through Christ, through Him who gives me strength, referring to Christ.
[time=2806] I can be content, no matter.
[time=2809] He said it doesn't matter if I'm hungry or well fed, clothed or naked, imprisoned or free.
[time=2815] Me choosing Christ, abiding in Christ.
[time=2821] That's where my contentment resides.
[time=2823] You can do that.
[time=2827] Godliness with contentment.
[time=2828] And then last week Josh said, fight the good.
[time=2831] He said, compete in the competition.
[time=2833] Step up, there's a competition going on.
[time=2835] There's a fight here.
[time=2836] Let's step up and fight for the faith.
[time=2839] You know who I'm fighting against?
[time=2841] I'm fighting against Satan, that masquerader of reasonableness.
[time=2846] I'm fighting against my own flesh.
[time=2851] It's a fight that I struggle in day after day after day.
[time=2855] And I'm fighting against the philosophy of this world that says, no, just conform to me.
[time=2860] And I'll give you the stuff you want.
[time=2864] I'll give you happiness.
[time=2868] That's a lie.
[time=2868] It's a fight.
[time=2873] Josh said we need to fight it.
[time=2877] We need to believe the truth about God.
[time=2879] And then behave accordingly.
[time=2883] Believe what's true, doctrine.
[time=2886] Behave in alignment with that.
[time=2890] Even when it doesn't seem reasonable.
[time=2893] I love it.
[time=2896] So then I decided to just go through a few of those passages
[time=2902] and share with you some decisions, applications in my life that I bumped into.
[time=2908] One of those was my bumping into Timothy that I told you about earlier.
[time=2913] I did that at this point in the sermon first hour.
[time=2915] Big, big, big impact on my life.
[time=2921] I had calls often when I was working here that were for more money.
[time=2928] But they weren't broader and they weren't deeper.
[time=2932] They were another school where I,
[time=2938] they were about more money.
[time=2939] They always offered more money when they called.
[time=2941] Did you know that?
[time=2943] How do they find out what you're making?
[time=2944] I don't know.
[time=2945] But it wasn't about broader and deeper.
[time=2948] So I just always said no, until one came up that seemed broader and deeper and I went to the school board and I went to the elders.
[time=2954] And I said, a guy called me and he says he wants me to pray about doing something else.
[time=2958] And I told them what it was and they said, well, what would you like to do?
[time=2961] And I said, I'd like to minister to men and women in the marketplace, have them focus their attention on building the kingdom in the marketplace.
[time=2969] And some of our board members and some of our elders right here joined and we together put race to win together.
[time=2977] And I started doing that because it appeared to us that that was a broader opportunity for me and maybe deeper.
[time=2983] And I made a couple more decisions since then, just recently another one based on that principle.
[time=2992] You see, Timothy did whatever broadened and deepened his ministry.
[time=2999] That's what I want to do.
[time=3002] Sound doctrine conforms to the glorious reality of our blessed God and who he is.
[time=3011] Sound doctrine does that.
[time=3012] We need to align to him and his doctrine.
[time=3016] Any teaching that's counter to or leaves Christ out.
[time=3029] and they say it's significant, it isn't.
[time=3031] My story without him is about a house in Zulu,
[time=3043] some cars I've had, some stuff I've done.
[time=3050] It all burns.
[time=3053] My story in Christ is forever.
[time=3057] He is worth my attention and he's worth me telling you about him.
[time=3062] I told you that I have chosen to and I long to submit to elders.
[time=3073] God has us in a position that he wants us to submit to the collective elders of the body of Christ.
[time=3079] When I was in my 20s, I set my heart on being one.
[time=3088] Denominations lean toward ways that God's word doesn't lean.
[time=3093] Be careful of those.
[time=3095] Chapter five, big impact on me.
[time=3101] Chapter five, let's just listen to me for chapter five, verse seven.
[time=3107] It says give the people these instructions to so that no one may be open to blame.
[time=3111] If anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for his immediate family, he is worse than an unbeliever.
[time=3119] When I read that, now that got my attention.
[time=3122] I'm worse than an unbeliever if I don't provide for my family
[time=3128] and especially my immediate family.
[time=3132] Well, I assumed my immediate family was all I needed to provide for.
[time=3136] No, no.
[time=3138] God wants us to take care of our family members.
[time=3143] So I went to see Dad.
[time=3146] And I said, Dad, I just read first Timothy chapter five.
[time=3150] I'm probably in my 20s.
[time=3152] I said, no, I just, I said, I'm worse than an unbeliever if I don't plan on taking care of you and mom and my sisters and my brother and my cousins.
[time=3161] And I just don't want to be worse than an unbeliever.
[time=3163] Dad, let's figure out how I'm going to be able to take care of you when you need taken care of.
[time=3168] My dad said, no, you know why?
[time=3170] Because my dad was very reasonable.
[time=3174] He'd been taught that he was to plan for that.
[time=3178] He was to be independent.
[time=3180] He wasn't supposed to depend on his children.
[time=3183] What he didn't realize was I needed him to be dependent on me.
[time=3189] I needed it.
[time=3191] He didn't need it.
[time=3192] He was going to be independent.
[time=3193] He had it all figured out.
[time=3195] But when he chose to let me engage in taking care of him,
[time=3202] it changed everything in us.
[time=3204] I said, okay, dad, I'm only going to do this for 22 years because you only did it for 22 for me.
[time=3211] I said, so if you lived to be 112, then I'm going to quit.
[time=3214] He laughed too.
[time=3217] I also said, dad, I'm only going to change your diaper for two years.
[time=3220] We had a good laugh about that.
[time=3223] But you know what?
[time=3226] I needed that.
[time=3231] It grew me up.
[time=3233] I'm now taking care of Renee's dad.
[time=3237] He's 93.
[time=3239] Nancy's mom, she's 93.
[time=3242] It's been really good for us to meet them.
[time=3246] Carl came over for Thanksgiving.
[time=3247] He's 93.
[time=3248] It was so rich having him in our house, Thursday.
[time=3252] For us, for the kids.
[time=3254] Powerful.
[time=3259] Chapter six, I got another lesson.
[time=3261] When money are a byproduct,
[time=3268] when money and things are a byproduct of working to glorify God, we get to enjoy them.
[time=3275] We get to enjoy them.
[time=3280] We get to enjoy sharing them.
[time=3283] We get to enjoy them enjoying them.
[time=3285] It brings joy.
[time=3289] (inhales) When money and things are the end, when money and things and stuff are what you're seeking.
[time=3300] When they're the end, then they make us happy for a little while.
[time=3305] And then we start looking for the next one.
[time=3309] The robis of our joy.
[time=3312] I was sitting in the heritage room back here.
[time=3316] There were like four of us in there.
[time=3320] And a guy came in that I'd never met before.
[time=3322] He walked in and he introduced ourselves to each other.
[time=3325] We talked for a little while.
[time=3326] And eventually, I could sense there was a little struggle he was going through.
[time=3330] I said, "What's going on?" And he said, "Well." He said, "I just got a car today "and I feel guilty about it." I said, "Man, why do you feel guilty about it?" He said, "Well, it's too much money "and it's too nice and all these things." I said, "What kind is it?" He said, "It's a Porsche Boxster.
[time=3347] "They just come out, I knew all about them.
[time=3350] "I wanted one." I said, "Can we go look at it?
[time=3353] "We went out in the parking lot and we looked at it." And I'm looking at that thing and it was absolutely beautiful.
[time=3359] I couldn't buy one.
[time=3360] I said, "Maybe you haven't ever really studied "first Timothy chapter six." He said, "I haven't." I said, "Well, let me tell you what it says." It says, "Command those who are rich "in this present world.
[time=3373] "Not to be arrogant or put their hope in wealth, "which is so uncertain.
[time=3377] "But to put their hope in God who richly provides them "with everything for their enjoyment." I said, "He wants you to enjoy having this.
[time=3387] "If it's a byproduct, now if it's what you're pursuing, "get rid of it.
[time=3391] "If it's a product of you serving him, "working hard for him, doing good for the community, "having the environment, I mean the people around you "and the community pay you.
[time=3401] "If it's a product of that, that's good." I said, "But then listen to the rest of it." It says, "Command them to be rich in good deeds." That's what he expects of you when you have a Porsche Boxster.
[time=3411] Be rich in good deeds, generous and willing to share their Boxster.
[time=3416] (audience laughs) He takes his keys out and tries to give him to me.
[time=3421] I wouldn't take him.
[time=3423] About two weeks later, I was sitting in the office right back there.
[time=3427] He came walking through the office, through the keys into my office, said, "We're going away for the weekend.
[time=3432] "Have fun.
[time=3433] "You can't give them back." And just took off out the door.
[time=3435] So Nancy and I had a Boxster for a weekend.
[time=3439] (audience laughs) I believe he probably got more joy out of that Boxster that weekend than he did the day he bought it.
[time=3448] Now he had some happiness and I just encourage you, do things God's way.
[time=3458] Whatever he provides for you, you'll be able to enjoy fully.
[time=3463] But if you're in pursuit of it, you'll only be happy for a little while and there won't be joy.
[time=3471] He had joy and he gave me joy and he got joy out of me being joyful.
[time=3477] Many of you have provided for a lot of people around here that way.
[time=3483] I encourage you to keep doing that.
[time=3487] Believe what is true.
[time=3490] Find out what to believe by being busy in this word.
[time=3495] Then behave in accordance, in alignment
[time=3502] with what you say you believe.
[time=3504] There's power in that.
[time=3506] Paul knew it all the way back then when he told Timothy and now we know it too because it was written down for us.
[time=3513] Father in Heaven, please, help us grow in you.
[time=3519] Please Lord, fill us up with your spirit, empower us to do what's best to struggle through the tension of it and do it well to bring you praise and glory.
[time=3531] Thank you, thank you for Jesus.
[time=3534] In his name I pray, amen.
[time=3547] (gentle music)
