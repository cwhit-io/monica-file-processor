[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] Well, good morning everyone, my name is Steve Webster, I'm a teaching pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries. I'm so glad to be part of that team. I'm so glad that you're watching. I'm so glad that the Christmas season is upon us, and you're going to see this morning, what you're going to watch is the first Sunday of our Christmas with Blackhawk annual celebration. We have a lot to celebrate in this place. So grateful for the hard work that was done by our team to make the state.
[time=60] You're going to see this morning beautiful. It's appropriate friends. I've said often to many people that it's hard to make too much of Christmas. It's just that important. The arrival of God on earth in a baby is a really, really big deal. In fact, this season, our theme for Christ to the Blackhawk will be the word on Christmas. You're going to hear again this morning from our dear friend, Steve Longbreak, on John chapter 1.
[time=90] And when it says that the word became flesh, the word there is Jesus. It says in that chapter that the word was with God. The word was God. He was in the beginning with God. So the Bible paints this really high picture of Jesus, this this celestially high picture. So it's really important in a season celebrating his birth that we make a big deal about it.
[time=117] Because he is who the Bible says he is. He's God's own son. I've often wondered friends this season. I've often wondered at this miracle, this phenomenon that Christ didn't have to come into the world as a baby. But he did. He could have arrived in any number of ways that he wanted to. But he arrived in the most vulnerable, in the most humble way possible.
[time=143] And there were babies born to kings all over the world. And so the arrival of a prince was a big deal. But he was born, the Bible tells us, as you know, in a manger. Somewhere far away, shepherds came to celebrate his birth. This is a most unusual birth because he was a most unusual person.
[time=166] I can't wait for you to hear from Steve this morning on John chapter one on the word on Christmas. You're going to also hear here and see a drama from a drama department this morning that we're all very, very excited about. The stage again looks wonderful.
[time=182] I hope the stage is set in your heart, friends, for the Christmas season. I pray that you would experience the peace that only Christ can bring, not only the Christmas season, but every week of the year.
[time=196] This time of year, especially, we ask you all the time. You're part of our family. We would ask you again to come see us, come say hello, write us, call us, tell us that you're watching, tell us how the Bible hour has been an encouragement to you over the years.
[time=213] It would do our hearts a great deal of good to hear from you. It would do our hearts a great deal of good also to know that you hear these words around Christmas time, especially about Jesus and that you in his name care for somebody else, that you do your part in our community to celebrate his coming, his goodness, and his presence among us.
[time=236] As we always say, thank you for watching Merry Christmas from Black Hawk to you and your family. I have a wonderful week. Enjoy this morning.
[time=248] On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me a partridge in a pear tree. On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree.
[time=262] On the fourth day of Christmas my true love gave to me five golden rings, four cauliflower, three french turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree. On the ninth day of Christmas my true love gave to me.
[time=280] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=340] On the 12th day my true love gave to me, 12 drummers, drumming, like let's do it.
[time=355] [MUSIC - 38 seconds]
[time=423] Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it is with great pleasure that we welcome you here this morning with open arms while the weather outside may be frightful.
[time=442] Seeing you here is truly delightful, for it's the most wonderful time of the year.
[time=453] That is, if you are in love.
[time=457] >> You know it's Christmas, right?
[time=459] Not Valentine's Day.
[time=461] >> Yeah, you know Christmas, candy canes and fruitcakes.
[time=464] >> Chestnuts roasting on an open fire.
[time=467] >> Sugar plums and stocking.
[time=469] >> You log, it's a thing.
[time=474] >> True, while the story we tell may be about Christmas, it is also overflowing with love.
[time=483] >> It is a love that started before time began.
[time=488] >> A timeless, perfect love.
[time=490] >> For God so loved the world.
[time=494] >> That he made everything, he made you.
[time=498] >> And he made me.
[time=500] >> For God so loved the world.
[time=504] >> That he spent generations pursuing the world.
[time=507] >> To show them the way.
[time=508] >> To bring them back.
[time=509] >> But wait, let's take this back to the beginning.
[time=514] That is the beginning of mankind.
[time=519] >> In a beautiful garden, a lover wooed his bride.
[time=523] >> It was blissful.
[time=525] >> But then a weed crept into the garden of her heart and she left him.
[time=530] >> She rejected him.
[time=531] >> She broke his heart.
[time=533] >> She longed for him.
[time=535] >> Something had changed and things were different, but he loved her the same.
[time=540] >> But she was broken.
[time=542] >> She had the memory of what she had done.
[time=545] >> And the world around her covered her eyes.
[time=548] >> And filled her ears.
[time=550] >> And eventually she was filled with wickedness.
[time=552] >> Selfishness.
[time=553] >> And pride.
[time=554] >> And it all went wrong.
[time=556] >> Finally, in an effort to rescue his bride, he washed it clean with a flood.
[time=561] Now she could see him clearly and she could see how much she truly missed him.
[time=567] >> Endings were better, but only for a while.
[time=571] >> He loved her with this perfect, timeless love, but she didn't know how to love him back.
[time=577] >> So he gave her truth.
[time=579] >> Ten commandments on how to love him above all else and how to love others.
[time=584] >> He was patient with her.
[time=586] >> But she left him.
[time=587] >> He showed her kindness.
[time=589] >> But she rejected him.
[time=591] >> Eventually, she forgot the truth.
[time=593] >> The truth that would break her chains and set her free.
[time=597] >> The truth that the time had come when this humble lover would love her to his death.
[time=603] >> You see, through all of these stories of our unfaithfulness, God still loved his bride
[time=611] with a perfect, unending love.
[time=614] But we didn't even know what love was until he came.
[time=619] Suddenly love had a name.
[time=621] >> And that name was Jesus.
[time=623] >> And as we watched love grow from baby to man, we experienced love in ways we could have never
[time=631] imagined.
[time=633] >> Love looked beyond appearances.
[time=635] >> Love cared for the lonely.
[time=637] >> Love fed the hungry.
[time=639] >> Love played with the children.
[time=641] >> Love corrected the crooked.
[time=643] >> Love touched.
[time=645] >> The untouchable.
[time=646] >> Love fixed.
[time=647] The broken.
[time=648] >> We watched.
[time=649] >> Love live.
[time=650] And what we saw changed everything.
[time=653] And it still does today.
[time=662] [MUSIC]
[time=677] >> Just a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes.
[time=680] Hope has arrived.
[time=682] Many still don't know.
[time=684] God's come to earth through an ordinary virgin girl.
[time=691] Peace, love and joy come to make things right.
[time=696] Men walked in darkness.
[time=698] Now there is a light from a cradle.
[time=702] A cradle that rocks the world.
[time=708] It's not a God because it's not a man.
[time=713] It's perfect to keep.
[time=714] It's a perfect land.
[time=716] I'm feeling a plan.
[time=718] Nothing's late.
[time=719] He's for the sponsor of the world.
[time=724] And songs is the end.
[time=726] Everything has changed.
[time=728] All of our forever is forever.
[time=731] We're raised by a cradle.
[time=734] A cradle that rocks the world.
[time=738] Come on.
[time=739] Help us out.
[time=740] Put your hands together.
[time=741] [MUSIC]
[time=745] Can't believe that it could be.
[time=749] A beautiful place that we can't conceive.
[time=753] A place where the streets are cold and the gates are burned.
[time=761] But that's what it did so long ago.
[time=765] We came as a maid.
[time=767] So the world will know of a cradle.
[time=771] A cradle that rocks the world.
[time=775] Oh yeah.
[time=777] It's not a God because it's not a man.
[time=781] It's perfect to keep.
[time=783] It's a perfect land.
[time=785] I'm feeling a plan.
[time=787] Keep on the sponsor of the world.
[time=793] And songs is the end.
[time=795] Everything has changed.
[time=797] All of our forever is forever.
[time=800] We're raised by a cradle.
[time=803] A cradle that rocks the world.
[time=809] What a brilliant perfect land.
[time=813] Bringing love no earthly power can serve us.
[time=822] Tell the story we'll never end.
[time=825] The song will be sung again.
[time=828] And again forever.
[time=834] Son of God, He comes on a day.
[time=837] Heaven's perfect King is a perfect land.
[time=842] I'm feeling a plan.
[time=844] Keep on the sponsor of the world.
[time=848] A song to the end.
[time=851] Everything has changed.
[time=853] All of our forever is forever.
[time=856] We're raised by a cradle.
[time=859] A cradle that rocks the world.
[time=863] Oh yeah.
[time=865] A cradle.
[time=867] A cradle that rocks the world.

[time=1008] (upbeat music)
[time=1020] [MUSIC - 50 seconds]
[time=1073] (upbeat music) - Amen, thank you.
[time=1094] (audience applauding) (upbeat music)
[time=1103] (upbeat music) It's maybe a new one to you, listen at first.
[time=1111] And join in when you can.
[time=1117] [MUSIC - 206 seconds]
[time=1328] Now you know this one, we sang this last week.
[time=1335] It's my soul magnifies the Lord.
[time=1338] So I expect to hear some great, loud singing.
[time=1343] If you don't sing loudly all the time, you can do it for Jesus, it's worship, you can do it.
[time=1350] Sing it. [MUSIC] [MUSIC - 229 seconds]
[time=1599] (upbeat music) - Amen.
[time=1605] (clapping) - That's excellent.
[time=1607] Thanks for worshiping with us.
[time=1609] You may be seated.
[time=1611] Let's pray.
[time=1614] Father, I praise you because of who you are, who you are this morning, who you were yesterday and who you will be.
[time=1624] I praise you 'cause you're the same.
[time=1627] I thank you so much, Father, for your son.
[time=1629] I thank you for times like this that we get to remember something so significant in our faith in the gospel.
[time=1640] I need things like this to help me remember.
[time=1643] I thank you for this church.
[time=1645] I pray for them.
[time=1647] I pray, Father, that they can worship, continue to worship this morning.
[time=1650] I pray that they can continue to worship in December.
[time=1654] And remember who you are and do things because they love you.
[time=1659] Thank you for your protection.
[time=1661] Thank you so much.

[time=1917] (upbeat music)
[time=1947] - God, the one and only.
[time=1956] The only begotten, sometimes that's translated.
[time=1959] Came to us to give us real life.
[time=1967] Real life.
[time=1970] And John chapter one is the passage of scripture
[time=1977] that all this morning's music was kind of weaved around.
[time=1982] John chapter one, verse one.
[time=1985] Tom, one of the first things I ever heard you teach on was John one, one.
[time=1992] And you emphasized the word, the Lagos.
[time=1996] In the beginning was the word.
[time=2000] And the word was with God.
[time=2008] He was with God in the beginning.
[time=2014] The Lord Jesus, God the Son, God the Father, God the Spirit, inseparable, unexplainable, and one and there in the beginning.
[time=2035] In the beginning was the word.
[time=2038] The word was with God and the word was God.
[time=2043] He was with God in the beginning.
[time=2046] Through him all things, verse three, were made.
[time=2053] Without him nothing that was made.
[time=2063] Without him absolutely nothing has been or was made.
[time=2068] In him was life and the life was the light of men.
[time=2074] The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.
[time=2081] John says.
[time=2082] There came a man who was sent from God his name, the light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.
[time=2088] John says.
[time=2089] There came a man who was sent from God his name, and who was sent from God his name was John.
[time=2093] He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe.
[time=2100] John the Baptist came and he was witness before Christ to tell all of us to get ready.
[time=2107] He's coming.
[time=2108] He himself wasn't the light.
[time=2111] He came only as a witness to the light, the true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.
[time=2120] He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.
[time=2125] He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.
[time=2129] Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.
[time=2136] Children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision, or a husband's will, but born of God.
[time=2151] The word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.
[time=2154] We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.
[time=2165] John testifies concerning him.
[time=2170] He cries out saying, "This was he of whom I said, 'He who is coming comes after me.
[time=2177] He surpasses me because he was before me.' He's the only one you can say that about.
[time=2185] He comes after me, but he was before me.
[time=2192] He surpasses me.
[time=2196] Nobody was before me and comes after me, but him.
[time=2201] He's the I am.
[time=2205] Nobody else is.
[time=2207] From the fullness of his grace,
[time=2213] we have all received one blessing after another, John says.
[time=2218] For the law was given through Moses,
[time=2225] grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
[time=2232] No one has ever seen God, but God, the one and only, who is at the Father's side, has made him known.
[time=2242] God, the one and only, came to us to give us life.
[time=2248] People have been thinking up and creating gods forever past
[time=2254] to try to earn their favor, to earn their way toward them, to express their religion so they could feel better about what was going on.
[time=2262] And the only true God came to us instead of creating a plan for us to come to him.
[time=2268] In the beginning was the Word.
[time=2275] In Genesis chapter 1, the Word spoke.
[time=2286] The Lord Jesus Himself, the speaker.
[time=2289] In Genesis 1, He spoke everything into existence.
[time=2294] It said, He was in the beginning.
[time=2300] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[time=2306] All of it.
[time=2308] And then He goes on to give some detail about that.
[time=2311] And He says that He said the first morning and the first evening, the first day,
[time=2319] He said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
[time=2328] On the second day, He said, "Let there be an expanse between the waters that are above
[time=2340] and the waters that are below." And He created the sky.
[time=2346] There was evening and there morning.
[time=2349] Second day.
[time=2351] And then the Word said, "Let there be land and vegetation."
[time=2359] And He created the land and the vegetation.
[time=2362] And there was evening and morning.
[time=2364] And then He said, "The next day, let there be a greater light to shine by day and a lesser light to shine by night." Did you see those last night and this morning?
[time=2380] Wow.
[time=2382] He created those the way we define evening and morning
[time=2391] after He'd already had evenings and mornings.
[time=2395] And those of you that want to spend your time trying to figure that out, enjoy it.
[time=2401] I'm just going to enjoy Him that that's the way He does it.
[time=2405] It doesn't make any sense.
[time=2411] His ways aren't my ways.
[time=2414] His thoughts aren't my thoughts.
[time=2417] But that's the way He did it.
[time=2419] And then it says, "After He created the greater and lesser light, the next day He created the creatures that live in the sea and the creatures that fly in the air." All He did was speak them into existence, the Word of God.
[time=2437] Then He said, "Let there be living creatures on the earth
[time=2443] and among those He created man." It says He created Him in their image.
[time=2451] "Let us create man in our image, Trinity." I don't get it.
[time=2458] It's mysterious.
[time=2460] I'm not going to explain that, but I am going to bask in it.
[time=2463] He's God.
[time=2464] He's other than I am.
[time=2466] I don't have to understand everything about Him.
[time=2468] I can enjoy the fact that He came here.
[time=2473] And so the Word of God, existing then, before all that,
[time=2480] He was in the beginning.
[time=2486] He was God and He was with God also.
[time=2495] Wow.
[time=2500] Then He was the light.
[time=2502] It says He shines in the darkness.
[time=2504] That caused me to think about Colossians 1, where Jesus is again depicted as the creator of everything.
[time=2514] Verse 15 of Colossians 1, it says, "He is the image of the invisible God." And this is a pathetic illustration of that.
[time=2527] You cannot, in human terms, describe Him.
[time=2534] But I remember thinking years ago, oh, if you stand the God,
[time=2540] the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in front of a mirror, maybe it's Jesus that you see in the mirror.
[time=2547] He's the image of the invisible God.
[time=2551] He came in flesh so that we could see His image.
[time=2559] He's the first born over all creation.
[time=2563] If you've been in other parts of the world, you'd understand first born better.
[time=2569] In many places around the world, if you're the first born, you have responsibility for all those born after you in your family.
[time=2579] And you get authority that comes along with that.
[time=2583] There's a position that comes with that.
[time=2585] He is the first born over all creation.
[time=2587] Everything that ever has been created.
[time=2589] He has the position of authority, and He took on the responsibility to come to us.
[time=2598] He's the first born for by Him all things were created.
[time=2601] Things in heaven and on earth.
[time=2603] He created everything in heaven, and He created everything on the earth.
[time=2608] Visible and invisible.
[time=2610] Well, what in the world are the invisible things that He created?
[time=2615] I asked Nancy, she right away said, "Oh, it's air, wind.
[time=2618] That's part of it." Everything metaphysical that you can think of is wisdom visible.
[time=2624] He created it.
[time=2627] Everything metaphysical that He created.
[time=2630] He created.
[time=2631] Ponder that for a while.
[time=2634] He created the things in heaven.
[time=2636] He created the invisible things.
[time=2639] He created the thrones and powers and rulers and authorities.
[time=2643] He created everything.
[time=2646] And then He came.
[time=2651] And John gave witness of that.
[time=2661] He's before all things, and in Him all things hold together.
[time=2668] If He doesn't hold it together, believe me, it's coming apart.
[time=2675] I remember asking Joe Rich a long time ago.
[time=2677] I said, "Joe, I'm no scientist." So when I read the Bible and I see this stuff, and then I look at science, and I see the way God has repeated a few things, it just draws me to Him in incredible ways.
[time=2691] I said, "What do scientists, how do they explain this?" When I look at electrons going around neutrons, the protons, the nucleus of the atom, when I see that, when I see those, I don't see them, when I understand that a little bit, that they're going at just the right speed, they're going on just the right path.
[time=2714] The nucleus of the atom has just enough pull on them with that charge to keep them just the right distance because they're going the right speed, and that's the right pull, and they all do that and electron after electron on this right path, going around these, that are creating these atoms, that then they get together, they hook up on others that are on just the right path, going just the right speed, and they form molecules, and then I see that repeated, I said, not just in the microcosm, I see it as the planets pass around our Sun,
[time=2752] as our solar system fits in this galaxy, as the galaxies revolve around something, they don't know what it is, but they know they're all going really fast and they're revolving around something.
[time=2768] I know him.
[time=2771] I said, "Joe, what do they say?" He said, "Well, they call it cosmic glue."
[time=2781] I said, "Well," he said, "sometimes they call it the strong force."
[time=2788] Inexplainable, over and over again, perfect in every way.
[time=2793] I know him.
[time=2796] I know the strong force.
[time=2798] When he stops holding it together, we've messed with that a little bit on this Earth.
[time=2803] You know, when they built the first atomic bomb, they weren't sure that if they did split an atom, if they did have real fission take place, that it might just cause all the atoms everywhere to split, and it might just explode everything.
[time=2819] They weren't sure. There was fear there.
[time=2823] But he stopped it from splitting everything.
[time=2827] He holds it all together.
[time=2829] When he stops doing it, I don't know if it'll be fission or fusion, but we're not going to be here.
[time=2837] This is going to be -- this Earth is going to burn up.
[time=2840] Remember, that's what it says.
[time=2842] It's going to pass away.
[time=2844] All the things in it.
[time=2846] There'll be a new heaven and a new Earth.
[time=2848] That's what Revelation chapter 21 tells us, because he has stopped holding it together.
[time=2853] He's before all things, and in him all things hold together.
[time=2857] And he is the head of the body, the church.
[time=2862] He's the beginning and the first born from among the dead.
[time=2867] So that in everything he's ever created, everything you know to exist, everything that anybody can see, touch, experience, he will have the supremacy.
[time=2879] And he deserves it.
[time=2882] In the beginning was the Word.
[time=2885] He now holds it all together.
[time=2888] And when he doesn't anymore, we'll be with him.
[time=2891] He deserves our attention this morning.
[time=2896] And then it said, for God was pleased to have all of his fullness dwell in this person, the person Jesus who was born a baby.
[time=2905] God was pleased to have all of his fullness dwell in him and through him to reconcile to himself all things, things in heaven and on Earth, visible and invisible, all of it.
[time=2915] Everything that's been created.
[time=2917] He's reconciling all of it to himself through Jesus.
[time=2920] Through his blood shed on the cross.
[time=2925] Now that is something for us to focus on this December.
[time=2931] He deserves our attention.
[time=2933] He is the supreme one.
[time=2935] He is the one and only one who is able to create it all,
[time=2941] come here and live out an obedient, perfect life
[time=2948] to be sacrificed for me.
[time=2952] He's the one and only one who is able.
[time=2956] And he came.
[time=2958] He came.
[time=2960] He came to give us life.
[time=2964] Abundant life.
[time=2967] That's something to celebrate this December.
[time=2973] Back to John 1.
[time=2978] It says verse 6, "There came a man who was sent from God.
[time=2981] His name was John." We know that was John the Baptist.
[time=2983] He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe.
[time=2989] He himself was not the light.
[time=2990] John knew he wasn't the light.
[time=2993] He was special.
[time=2995] Jesus said if they'd accepted him, they're in Matthew 17.
[time=2998] Jesus said if the people had received him, he'd have been Elijah.
[time=3004] He was Elijah if he'd been received as Elijah.
[time=3009] Elijah's coming back, the Bible says.
[time=3011] And Jesus says, oh yeah, he did.
[time=3016] He himself was not the light he came only as a witness to the light.
[time=3019] The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world and he did come.
[time=3028] He was in the world and the world was made through him.
[time=3030] The world did not recognize him.
[time=3033] And they haven't today.
[time=3039] The whole world was made through him and he was rejected.
[time=3047] He came to do that which was his own.
[time=3050] To that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.
[time=3053] Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.
[time=3059] Children born not of a natural descent, nor of human decision, or a husband's will, but born of God.
[time=3067] Do you realize this morning?
[time=3070] Are you conscious of them?
[time=3072] Yeah, you had a physical dad and mom, good.
[time=3077] You have a father in heaven who saw fit to send his son, his own self,
[time=3084] to die for your sins and to be light for you so that you can be enlightened.
[time=3090] He adopted you.
[time=3094] You are a part of his family.
[time=3097] My father is God almighty.
[time=3102] My brother is the Lord Jesus Christ creator of heaven and earth.
[time=3108] And by his spirit, I'm sealed and I know that's true.
[time=3114] I've been, I came from a really good family.
[time=3117] I'm thankful for my family.
[time=3119] Do you know how much the peace that that family can give me compares to the peace I have through God, my father, and the Lord Jesus Christ who by grace saved me?
[time=3131] That's what I need to be aware of this December.
[time=3137] The word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.
[time=3141] Thank you God for doing that.
[time=3143] We've seen his glory, the glory of the one and only who came from the father full of grace and full of truth.
[time=3151] Jesus is the ultimate truth teller.
[time=3154] He's always spoke the truth.
[time=3156] He wants us to speak the truth and he's the ultimate grace giver.
[time=3160] We couldn't reach him.
[time=3162] We're going to read here.
[time=3164] Moses brought the law.
[time=3168] We couldn't reach God through the law.
[time=3171] God revealed that we couldn't reach him through the law.
[time=3174] We can't keep all the rules.
[time=3176] We can't be perfect.
[time=3178] We cannot be holy, but in Christ he makes us holy.
[time=3187] His truth is, he's just, he's a truth teller.
[time=3191] He's a truth keeper.
[time=3193] Jesus had to die to pay the penalty and make justice rain.
[time=3200] But by grace, by grace he just looked into your heart and he said,
[time=3209] "I want you." And when you believe that, when you believe that he has drawn you and he has saved you through the blood of Christ, you get to experience the reality of what he's talking about here.
[time=3224] John testifies concerning him, verse 15.
[time=3226] He cries out saying, "This was he of whom I said.
[time=3230] He who comes after me, born after me, surpasses me because he was before me."
[time=3241] He's the one that was before he came.
[time=3248] He surpasses me because he was before me.
[time=3252] He's the only one that has always been I am.
[time=3258] He's the one and only.
[time=3262] The rest of us have a beginning and no end.
[time=3267] People sometimes live like they have an end.
[time=3270] We have a beginning and we have no end.
[time=3273] He had no beginning.
[time=3274] He's the only one.
[time=3275] And John says, "He surpasses me." He's the only one that is the I am.
[time=3284] From the fullness of his grace, we have all received one blessing after another.
[time=3291] In some of the turmoil that you live in, it's easy to forget the things that are the real blessings.
[time=3299] Life forever with him reconciled to him.
[time=3305] Life forever reconciled to the king of kings, the Lord of lords, the God who created everything.
[time=3312] Life forever reconciled to him.
[time=3314] That's a blessing that I need to remember.
[time=3320] He says this, "For the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."
[time=3327] Paul spends Romans 5, 6, and 7, all the way through chapter 11,
[time=3334] praying and explaining that.
[time=3336] It's powerful.
[time=3339] Powerful.
[time=3340] I can't keep the rules.
[time=3343] I remember lying on the hard floor at night trying to pay penance.
[time=3348] I was guilty about the stuff I did when I was like eight, nine, ten years old.
[time=3352] So I'd sleep on this tile floor trying to earn his favor there.
[time=3357] What a waste of time.
[time=3358] I always got up and went to bed.
[time=3360] Never made it through the night.
[time=3363] But I was trying.
[time=3364] I wanted to earn his favor.
[time=3366] I wanted to be forgiven.
[time=3368] And he had a different plan.
[time=3371] It wasn't me keeping the law that Moses revealed to me.
[time=3374] The law, Paul said, reveals my inability to keep the law.
[time=3380] It reveals my need for, my utter dependence on him coming to us rather than us trying to get to him because we can't get to him.
[time=3393] And he says this.
[time=3395] No one has ever seen God, but God the one and only.
[time=3399] Nobody's seen God, but God.
[time=3405] God the one and only who is at the father's side has made him known.
[time=3410] Listen to this.
[time=3412] In verse one, he was in the beginning.
[time=3414] In verse 14, he came here in the flesh and lived here as a man.
[time=3420] And now in verse 18, it says, he is at the father's side.
[time=3428] Now that's something to know.
[time=3433] God, the one and only one who could.
[time=3441] Full of truth and grace.
[time=3443] God, the one and only one who could, came here as a baby
[time=3449] died on that cross for each of us.
[time=3452] Don't go home thinking there are three applications today.
[time=3456] What I want you to do is this.
[time=3458] Bask.
[time=3460] Enjoy the relief.
[time=3463] The pleasure that comes in knowing that God came to you.
[time=3473] He came to you and you're worth it.
[time=3481] He loves you.
[time=3483] Enjoy that this morning.
[time=3487] God, the one and only, came to give us life, Emmanuel.
[time=3517] Peace, name, be back, you were.
[time=3547] God, the one and only one who could.
