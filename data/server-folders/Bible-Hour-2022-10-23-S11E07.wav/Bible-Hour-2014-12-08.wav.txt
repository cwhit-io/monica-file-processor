[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=31] Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=35] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=37] I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=40] I'm glad to be part of the team.
[time=42] This time of year is a tremendously exciting time of the year.
[time=45] There's so much activity going on around the church.
[time=48] And that seems appropriate.
[time=51] We are eagerly anticipating the arrival of our king.
[time=56] And so it would seem appropriate as if a king were visiting a foreign country or if someone came to our own country.
[time=64] There would be a lot of activity surrounding the arrival of that visiting dignitary.
[time=70] And so what Christmas represents to us here at Black Hawk is just that.
[time=74] But to a much larger degree that the king of the universe, Jesus Christ has come to be with us, God with us.
[time=82] And so there is a flurry of activity around here these days.
[time=86] We are making much of Christmas.
[time=88] I think that's appropriate as well.
[time=91] A lot to anticipate, a lot to talk about that you'll see this morning on the broadcast.
[time=97] This morning is going to be our annual kids production of Christmas with Black Hawk.
[time=103] And the name of the production this morning is, "Dude, you hear what I hear." And I got to see it recently all the way through.
[time=111] And I have to tell you that you'll be marvelously encouraged by what you see.
[time=115] You'll be encouraged by the beauty and simplicity of the message.
[time=120] It reminds me a lot of, it's a Charlie Brown Christmas.
[time=124] It's simplicity.
[time=126] It's all the noise and all the busyness of our holiday season.
[time=130] It's so easy to miss the manger.
[time=133] It's so easy to miss the reason that we're doing it all in the first place.
[time=138] And after you, along with hearing the kids' musical, you're going to hear from Jesse Hannah
[time=144] and we're going to tag team this morning.
[time=146] Just a little message about what it means for us to hear from God this Christmas.
[time=151] You'll hear me talk about Psalm 19 and how important it is that we hear from God's law.
[time=156] That God's law can revive our souls.
[time=159] It's perfect. It can give light to our eyes.
[time=163] And I think about, this morning as I was reading through Psalm 19, I was just impressed at how much I need that reviving in my soul.
[time=170] How much I need the light for my eyes.
[time=174] How much I need wisdom as a simple person.
[time=176] I need those things. We all do.
[time=179] And so the best way in any season of the year for us to hear from God is to lock into what his word says.
[time=186] And so, Jesse and I this morning are going to invite you into that conversation this morning.
[time=191] We're going to invite you to this Christmas season to stop and to hear from God.
[time=196] Certainly, we are so grateful that you're tuning in to the Bible hour and we hope that week by week you hear from God as you tune in because we value the word of God as a very high priority.
[time=207] And you don't need to hear from us.
[time=209] We might have some really good advice.
[time=211] We might have some clever things to say.
[time=214] But what you need and what we need is to hear from God's word.
[time=218] We're committed to that.
[time=219] We're committed day by day, week by week to you as our family.
[time=224] We're committed to bringing the word of God to you.
[time=226] This morning is no exception.
[time=227] You're going to hear it from kids.
[time=229] Wisdom from the mouths of babes of little kids.
[time=232] And I just can't wait for you to see it.
[time=233] I can't wait for you to hear from the Scriptures this morning about hearing from God this season.
[time=238] Again, it's remarkable to me in all of business and all of our preparation that sometimes we miss the point.
[time=247] Sometimes we just skate right on by and miss that baby boy in the manger.
[time=254] So this is an invitation to you this morning to sit back, to watch and to remember what Christmas is all about.
[time=261] To think about what it means to hear from God this Christmas season.
[time=264] To open your Bibles, to read the story with fresh eyes and to remember the great gift that God has given us.
[time=272] What it also to mention to you this morning is something really big coming up this January.
[time=277] Starting January 4th, we are committed as a church to go to one service on Sunday morning.
[time=283] So we would have a nine o'clock community hour where we would be meeting in smaller settings all over the campus.
[time=289] And then 1045 would be our one Sunday morning gathering in the worship center.
[time=295] That's a great opportunity for us in several ways.
[time=298] There's an energy that's going to bring as we're all in the room together that I'm really excited about.
[time=303] It's going to bring unity to us as a church because we're going again to be all in the room at the same time.
[time=310] And we say to you over and over again how important it is for us to be in community.
[time=315] And so in effect, friends, this is just a chance for us to put our money where our mouth is.
[time=319] If we really do believe that life change happens best in those smaller settings than we are inviting you.
[time=324] Inviting all those who are attached to Black Hawk to commit to that first hour Sunday school hour, if you will,
[time=331] and then come then gather in the worship center on Sunday morning.
[time=336] So we're encouraged by that. That's the reason we're doing it.
[time=339] We want to just infuse us with energy.
[time=342] The New Year seems like a good time to do that.
[time=344] We're going to be unified and all in this together.
[time=347] And we're also just really interested in if we say we believe in community, if we say we believe in meeting in smaller settings, this is a chance to do that.
[time=356] Why don't you guys know that?
[time=357] As we always do, we thank you for watching. We thank you for being part of our family.
[time=361] We all here from Black Hawk wish you a very, very Merry Christmas.
[time=365] I hope to see you very, very soon.
[time=382] [MUSIC - 140 seconds]
[time=527] [APPLAUSE]
[time=532] Ladies and gentlemen, your Forest Creek Mondo Martley closing in 15 minutes.
[time=536] We're open seven days a week for your Christmas shopping convenience.
[time=539] And as always, we want to thank you for shopping right here at Mondo Mart.
[time=545] Gotcha! Oh, no, she got me.
[time=551] Where did you come from, Taylor?
[time=554] Are all of these kids yours?
[time=557] Oh, no. I'm just there, counselor.
[time=559] We're on our way to a Christmas camp for a couple of days.
[time=562] And we ran out of snacks.
[time=564] So we stopped to keep the natives from getting restless.
[time=567] Been there. That one's a little tiger.
[time=571] Yes, I'm afraid even a quick shopping trip can turn into a game of three segment tailors around.
[time=576] Oh, I know. I just stumbled on her tagging people in the furniture section.
[time=581] Oh, I'm so sorry. I hope we're not disrupting things in your store.
[time=584] Oh, no. Good.
[time=586] Did we have time for one more game of the freeze tag before we go?
[time=589] Please.
[time=590] Taylor, the store's closing.
[time=591] Besides, I really don't think my goodness you are quite the freeze tag player.
[time=597] I'm sorry. She's really shy.
[time=600] She really doesn't talk at all unless she knows you.
[time=604] One more game. Well, you got your hands full.
[time=608] And I have to get ready to close the store.
[time=610] You all have fun shopping.
[time=612] We'll sure try. Okay, kids. Time to get back on the bus.
[time=616] We got a long way to drive. And it's getting late.
[time=620] Everybody here? Where's Taylor?
[time=622] She got shine ran back to the bus. I saw her heading that direction.
[time=626] He's probably on the last row of sleep already.
[time=629] Miss Kim? Yes. Why do you think Taylor's so shy?
[time=632] Well, her mom said that when she was little, she said some words funny, and people used to make fun of her.
[time=638] No, she speaks just fine, but she's still too afraid to speak in front of anybody she doesn't know.
[time=644] That's too bad. She's really nice once you get to know her.
[time=647] Look at this.
[time=649] What is it?
[time=650] It's a truck. I think. I'm not sure. But it's so cool.
[time=654] You don't even know what it is and you want it. It's just a funny looking truck.
[time=658] No, I think it's one of those trucks that turns into a robot.
[time=662] It looks like a robot that turns into a different robot.
[time=664] It looks like a robot that turns into a pilot broken plastic.
[time=668] I have to get this. I mean, I know somebody who would love this.
[time=673] Brooke, I can't believe it. Look! Kids, we have to leave. Get to the bus.
[time=678] I have to text my mom and tell her that they still have these at Mom No Mark.
[time=684] Miss Kim, Miss Kim, I want to get this.
[time=686] I used to be on camp, honey.
[time=688] Joey, Christmas is in a week.
[time=690] I know. It's not for me. It's for my mom.
[time=716] Miss Kim, it's here.
[time=723] What's here?
[time=724] But Justin, Harthrot, Book of Tweets, it's all of his tweets from the last year.
[time=727] No.
[time=728] Yes. Look at this one. I just sneeze.
[time=730] Get soon tight, Justin. Get soon tight.
[time=732] Ahhh!
[time=734] You gotta get it. You know we gotta get it. We're really gotta get it for Christmas.
[time=753] We couldn't find it anywhere else. I know we gotta be in this store.
[time=758] Is that what I think it is?
[time=762] Yup, I want what is it? It's called a thousand random pieces and a megaphone.
[time=768] Sounds horrible. How does it work?
[time=771] You throw all the pieces up in the air and megaphone your brother to pick them up.
[time=774] We are out of here.
[time=776] We gotta get it. We know we gotta get it. We're really gotta get it for Christmas.
[time=781] We never seen it. We never seen it. We never seen anything like before.
[time=786] We gotta get it. We gotta get it. We're really gotta get it for Christmas.
[time=791] We couldn't find it anywhere else. I know we gotta be in this store.
[time=801] We never seen anything but like this. It's what it would be. It's what I think.
[time=806] This is something everyone will get.
[time=808] You know, I know the difference between wants and needs.
[time=813] Come on, Mom. Buy it, please.
[time=819] We gotta get it. We've all gotta get it. We're really gotta get it for Christmas.
[time=825] We never seen it. We've all never seen it. We've never seen anything like before.
[time=831] [MUSIC - 15 seconds]
[time=849] (upbeat music) - Is the coast clear?
[time=858] Any mannequins in the area speak up?
[time=860] Are you speaking to me?
[time=862] Before speaking to a princess, I believe it's customary to bow or curtsy.
[time=868] - Oh, excuse me, princess.
[time=872] I forgot for a moment.
[time=873] We had mannequins from girls costumes and clothing on the center aisle today.
[time=878] - I accept your apology.
[time=882] - Hey, this is Biff from Overland Hardware and Tools.
[time=885] - Biff, dude, long time no see, man.
[time=888] Moon dog, where have you been?
[time=890] - Just chilling shaw, big season over in sporting goods.
[time=893] - You two, gentlemen know each other?
[time=898] - Know each other, dude, we're tight.
[time=901] - I am not a dude, Mr. Moon dog.
[time=906] - I think they've locked up.
[time=909] - Oh no, it's cookie.
[time=911] I mean, greetings cookie.
[time=914] - Cookie, they should have had a nervous breakdown over in cookware.
[time=916] - Now, something to the shop turns out ask her who lives.
[time=920] - Boy, did you ever.
[time=921] - Are you still afraid of your own shadow?
[time=924] - No, Biff, I'm a new mannequin.
[time=926] Nothing scares me anymore.
[time=928] - Hello?
[time=929] Ah!
[time=930] - Shh.
[time=931] - Dude, you hear what I hear?
[time=933] - A customer?
[time=935] - A customer, freeze.
[time=936] - Hey, you guys, aren't you gonna come tag me?
[time=942] You guys, this isn't fair.
[time=944] I found a really good hiding place this time, you guys.
[time=948] - Guys, what do we do?
[time=949] - Who said that?
[time=950] - Cookie.
[time=951] - Oh, this is horrible.
[time=953] Wow, you're mannequins, and you're talking.
[time=956] - Oh, we're in big trouble.
[time=958] - I know this seems quite unusual, young person,
[time=964] but are you frightened?
[time=966] - No.
[time=967] - Why not?
[time=968] - Because I'm not here.
[time=969] This is obviously a dream.
[time=971] I wake up soon.
[time=972] - I'm in the back of the bus, a sleep.
[time=974] I'm only seeing this because I should never go to sleep after eating barbecue potato chips in grape soda.
[time=980] - Tatiana, are we just a dream?
[time=982] - Oh, no, dear.
[time=983] We're completely real, young lady.
[time=985] I am Tatiana, princess of costumes.
[time=989] And this is Biff, who does wonderful work for us in, - Hardware.
[time=995] - Moon Dog of some sporting goods and cookies from cookware.
[time=997] - And you are?
[time=998] - My name is Taylor.
[time=1000] - What department are you from?
[time=1001] - Department.
[time=1002] - Ugh, human kids, not sell those.
[time=1007] - This is epic.
[time=1008] We never get to meet anyone from outer space.
[time=1011] - I'm not from outer space.
[time=1013] Everything outside of this store is outer space.
[time=1018] - Well, I guess Christmas is the best time to be locked in a store.
[time=1021] - Semantic isn't all about Christmas.
[time=1024] - Yeah. - Yeah.
[time=1025] - Oh, yes, Taylor.
[time=1026] We love Christmas.
[time=1028] We weigh all year for it.
[time=1029] - Me too.
[time=1030] - Good.
[time=1032] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 52 seconds]
[time=1089] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 73 seconds]
[time=1166] (upbeat music)
[time=1174] - So if you look for the Christmas, all year long, you know all about Jesus then, right?
[time=1180] Right?
[time=1184] Never heard no Jesus, but sure no Christmas.
[time=1187] I don't understand.
[time=1189] Christmas without Jesus, how's that possible?
[time=1193] - Tatiana, tell her about Christmas.
[time=1196] - All right everyone, gather around and I'll tell you what we've learned over the years from the all wise public address system.
[time=1202] - You mean you learned it from Christmas songs from the store?
[time=1205] - Sure sweetie, now sit down.
[time=1207] As we all know, Christmas lasts for 12 days in December.
[time=1211] Although it starts right after Halloween now.
[time=1213] It was started by a man named Felix Navidad and his wife Mary Kaliki Maka.
[time=1218] They lived in a place called Huville and there they each had Red Rose Rain gear and five golden wings.
[time=1228] Every year they went on a picnic with their friend Sandy Claus and on a boulder named Jingle Bell Rock.
[time=1234] There they feasted on partridges, French Hens and a green soup called Grinch.
[time=1239] - Sounds fun.
[time=1241] - Well it wasn't 'til-- - I don't even like to think about it.
[time=1244] - Grandma got a daughter by a rain gear.
[time=1249] - But now everything is great because Monomart invented savings 40% throughout the Christmas season and everybody's happy.
[time=1256] - Merry Christmas to all and to all a good price.
[time=1260] - Oh brother, that's not Christmas.
[time=1262] It isn't really okay, that's it.
[time=1265] - Oh you do have one.
[time=1268] - A what?
[time=1269] - A Bible.
[time=1270] - Bibles, Al 23.
[time=1271] - Brother or Harvak, it's a great gift idea.
[time=1273] Bye when today.
[time=1275] - You guys, it's not just something you sell.
[time=1277] The Bible's God's story.
[time=1279] It's a message from the creator of the world.
[time=1281] There's all points to Jesus.
[time=1283] His birth, his death and resurrection.
[time=1286] - Reza what?
[time=1287] Sit down, let me tell you the true meaning of Christmas.
[time=1290] - Okay.
[time=1291] - Resurrection is later, but it may be the most important thing in the Bible.
[time=1298] For right now, you just need to know their Christmas is all about Jesus.
[time=1302] And when he came over to the earth with the people he created.
[time=1305] - So like, are you gonna tell us what happens from this Bible from Al 23?
[time=1309] That don't hold out in us now, Taylor.
[time=1311] - Okay, it starts a long, long time ago.
[time=1314] Like I said, God created the whole world.
[time=1317] He wanted everyone to know him.
[time=1319] The people turned their backs on God.
[time=1322] Yet he still wanted to save them.
[time=1324] Bring them back to himself.
[time=1326] He promised he would do it.
[time=1328] Just from everyone thought that God had forgotten them.
[time=1331] Something amazing started to happen.
[time=1333] (upbeat music)
[time=1349] [MUSIC - 114 seconds]
[time=1467] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 41 seconds]
[time=1513] - A silent alarm?
[time=1517] - Yep, goes off if there's a lot of movement in the store.
[time=1521] After closing.
[time=1522] - Burglars, you think?
[time=1525] - There's only one way to tell.
[time=1526] - What's that?
[time=1532] - A listening voice.
[time=1534] We ordered it online.
[time=1536] With this baby, we can hear everything that goes on inside the store.
[time=1540] - What do you hear?
[time=1541] - Well, there's some guy named Manuel.
[time=1546] - He must be a pretty bad hombre because there's a lot of people that need saved.
[time=1551] - And fast, I heard something about a little girl.
[time=1554] - He has someone talking about how much profit they're going to make, something about profits anyway?
[time=1561] - It's a robbery, all right.
[time=1562] Should we bust in?
[time=1563] - Yeah, I think we ought to.
[time=1565] - Wait, there's a girl in there.
[time=1570] If we bust in now, they'll take her hostage.
[time=1572] - Okay, no need to hurry.
[time=1575] Let's just take this nice and slow.
[time=1581] - So this Jesus person, you came from heaven?
[time=1584] - He's more than a person.
[time=1585] He's the Son of God, the creator of everything.
[time=1588] They came on earth to be with us and to save us.
[time=1591] Save, save, after Christmas, you save a bunch.
[time=1594] 40% off.
[time=1596] - Man, we're given the stuff away.
[time=1598] - We must be crazy.
[time=1600] - Saving's in every department.
[time=1602] Not that kind of saving.
[time=1604] Jesus not only saved us, he created us.
[time=1608] - Dude, maybe he created you, but my text says my creator was Ron from Acme Mannequins of Carbondale, Illinois.
[time=1615] I've never met Ron, but I'd love to meet that dude someday.
[time=1618] - I do know my creator and he's Jesus.
[time=1620] He came to earth because he loves people.
[time=1623] He came to earth to save us.
[time=1625] I mean, dog, what if the store's on fire and you're trapped and Ron from the Acme Mannequins of Carbondale, Illinois ran and saved you?
[time=1633] - Why would he do that?
[time=1634] He's probably made millions of mannequins.
[time=1636] - But what if someone told you that Ron was coming to save you?
[time=1639] - That would be the most awesome news ever.
[time=1642] - Well, that's what happened on the very first Christmas.
[time=1645] On the night Jesus was born, angels came down from heaven to tell people that God who made us was sitting his own son to save us.
[time=1652] - That must have been quite a night.
[time=1654] - It sure was.
[time=1655] Here's how the Bible says it in the chapter two.
[time=1658] And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.
[time=1664] An angel Lord appeared to them in the glorism around them and they're terrified, but the angel said to them, not be afraid.
[time=1671] I bring you good news of great joy.
[time=1673] That would be for all the people.
[time=1675] Today, he tells David, as Savior has been born to you, he is Christ the Lord.
[time=1680] [MUSIC - 169 seconds]
[time=1851] - Taylor, could you provide us with some assistance?
[time=1860] - She means, could you help us out with something?
[time=1862] - Sure, due to our created function, we have trouble visualizing important things that we're unable to see.
[time=1871] - What Tatiana means is, we're all about displays.
[time=1876] Mannequins are displays.
[time=1878] Sometimes it's hard for us to understand things we can't see.
[time=1881] Is there any way you can make it easier for us to understand the story?
[time=1884] - Oh, I get it, it's play.
[time=1886] Wait, a manger scene.
[time=1889] - Is that anything like an activity scene?
[time=1891] - Yes, it's the same thing.
[time=1893] Does the store have one?
[time=1894] - No, we used to, they got rid of it because some people didn't like it.
[time=1899] Put a lot of good mannequins out of work.
[time=1901] That shouldn't stop us.
[time=1902] We could build a manger scene right here.
[time=1904] - With what stuff?
[time=1905] - Anything.
[time=1906] The store's full of things we can use.
[time=1908] Let's look at what we need.
[time=1909] Sorry.
[time=1913] While they're there, time came for the baby to be born.
[time=1918] She gave birth to her firstborn, a son.
[time=1921] She wrapped him in cloth and placed him in a manger because there's no guest room available for them.
[time=1926] Who is she?
[time=1928] That's Mary.
[time=1929] She's the woman God chose to give birth to Jesus and Joseph's a man he promised of your husband.
[time=1935] We need a baby.
[time=1938] - Oh, and close to the baby.
[time=1943] - Ooh, ooh, and a manger.
[time=1944] I'll go get a manger.
[time=1946] What's a manger?
[time=1947] A manger is a feeding trough.
[time=1949] - I don't have a place to put hay or sheep and donkeys on the stables with them.
[time=1954] - I can make you one of those.
[time=1956] - Hey, look, I found clothes and an angel.
[time=1959] - Wow, an angel.
[time=1961] - Hello, angel.
[time=1963] My name is Cookie.
[time=1964] We are all mannequins.
[time=1966] - She's a decoration, Cookie.
[time=1968] She can't speak.
[time=1970] - I know that.
[time=1971] - Everybody knows that.
[time=1973] Mannequins talk.
[time=1975] Decorations do not.
[time=1977] Get your head on straight.
[time=1979] Is it crooked again?
[time=1981] - Look, a newborn child.
[time=1984] And here's the manger.
[time=1987] I even put shredded paper in it to make it look like hay.
[time=1990] - We have a Mary.
[time=1991] We have a Joseph.
[time=1992] What are we gonna do for the shepherds?
[time=1994] - Oh, I have a cousin over immense clothing.
[time=1996] - And my sister Alexa's over in sportswear.
[time=1999] We can get a whole bunch of mannequins to help.
[time=2001] - This is gonna be wonderful.
[time=2003] - It seems so amazing that God came to earth as such a little baby.
[time=2007] He must love people very much.
[time=2010] - God didn't just come to save people.
[time=2012] He became one of us.
[time=2014] When Jesus was born in Bethlehem as a little baby, he created a world.
[time=2018] He created for all people, he became a person.
[time=2021] God with us.
[time=2023] [MUSIC - 109 seconds]
[time=2134] (upbeat music)
[time=2149] - For Big Stuff News Network, this is Candy Little Reporting.
[time=2151] A huge police standoff has gone underway at the Monomart and Forest Creek.
[time=2155] With me is Deputy Tess Andrews.
[time=2157] Deputy Andrews, can you tell me what's going on?
[time=2159] - Well, Candy, it appears that we have a burglary in progress.
[time=2163] We suspect that there might be as many as 100 dangerous burglars inside the store.
[time=2168] We've used high tech listening devices and believe we know exactly what's going on.
[time=2173] - Thank you.
[time=2174] We now have the store manager, Charlotte Ebenezer.
[time=2176] Mrs. Ebenezer, we've heard discussions about angels to use us in a manual coming from inside your store.
[time=2183] - Candy, that's impossible.
[time=2185] We at Monomart are very careful to keep religion out of Christmas.
[time=2190] - Well, that's a good trick.
[time=2191] How did you do that?
[time=2193] - Well, it's not easy, but we're committed to communicating the true meaning of the holidays that they could save 40% off throughout the store here at Monomart through December 24th.
[time=2204] - So what are you hearing inside the store now, Deputy?
[time=2206] - Lots of movement.
[time=2207] Sounds like things are being moved around or dragged.
[time=2210] Not sure what's happening.
[time=2211] - So what's your next move, Deputy?
[time=2212] - Oh, well, Candy.
[time=2214] I think we're coming up on the time when we're going to have to bust in and end this situation.
[time=2219] - Well, there you have it.
[time=2220] A robbery gone wrong.
[time=2221] And our deputies are just about to end a tent standoff.
[time=2224] Reporting from Creekside, this is Candy Little.
[time=2227] - Here, I made a donkey out of a stickpony and a saw horse.
[time=2232] - That's beautiful.
[time=2233] Now we need a rice man.
[time=2234] Who you've come to the wrong place?
[time=2237] - No, wise men, Magi.
[time=2239] They were the men who studied everything they could about God and about science.
[time=2244] They lived a long, long way away.
[time=2246] Well, let's just listen to what the Bible says in Matthew.
[time=2249] After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked for his the one who's been born King of the Jews.
[time=2260] - They knew he was going to be born, even though they lived so far away.
[time=2264] God provided a star that they could follow at the bottom of the Jesus.
[time=2267] Listen, the star, when I headed them, told to stop over the place where the child was.
[time=2274] They saw the star, they were overjoyed.
[time=2277] On coming to the house, they saw the child, this is Mother Mary, and bowed down and worshiped him.
[time=2282] Then they opened the treasures and presented him with gifts at gold, bringing sis, and more.
[time=2287] - Well, Taylor, if you had enough cash, you could buy him some Monda gifts right here at Monda Mart.
[time=2294] - Monda, I don't really have any money, but that doesn't matter.
[time=2298] I think I know just the thing I can bring to Jesus.
[time=2301] [MUSIC - 166 seconds]
[time=2478] - Police, freak, dang it.
[time=2489] - Police, freeze, where are the burglars?
[time=2494] - Are you okay little girl, I'm fine.
[time=2496] - Are you sure, where'd they go?
[time=2499] - Who, the burglars?
[time=2501] - Burglars, there aren't any burglars in here.
[time=2504] - So much for mail order less thing devices, but I heard them.
[time=2509] - Who moved my mannequins and what's this?
[time=2513] - That looks like an activity scene.
[time=2516] - Mrs. Ebenezer, this is the most beautiful activity scene I've seen all season.
[time=2521] Who thought of including mannequins to represent everyday people?
[time=2525] It's brilliant.
[time=2526] Not only do they have the traditional clothings, but they all show how people worship Jesus now.
[time=2531] What creativity, would you mind if I did a story on it?
[time=2534] Lots of publicity for your store, of course.
[time=2537] - Well, Candy, we're very proud of our new Nativity scene, sure you can.
[time=2543] Are you okay, Taylor?
[time=2545] - Thank goodness you're all right.
[time=2547] Candy Little, BSN News Network.
[time=2549] Taylor, we've heard so many things tonight, and now we don't know what's true and what's not.
[time=2555] Help us out, what is this scoop?
[time=2557] - Candy, Taylor probably can't answer you.
[time=2560] You see, she's very-- - Let me have that.
[time=2562] Everyone thought they heard something tonight.
[time=2564] Please thought there's a bunch of burglars put there on.
[time=2568] Some people thought they had the true meaning Christmas, comes from a store.
[time=2572] That's not right either, and some people are just too free to talk.
[time=2575] - 'Cause they're afraid, people will make fun of them.
[time=2577] - Taylor, you're talking.
[time=2579] - Yep, you know what?
[time=2580] Everybody needs you, the true story of Christmas.
[time=2583] Lots of people think they've heard all about, we look forward to Christmas all year long, but they're missing it.
[time=2589] Tonight, I'm hearing it all like it's the first time.
[time=2592] And when we got news this good, people got to hear it.
[time=2596] - Dude, you hear what I hear?
[time=2599] - People all over the world have been watching our coverage of this intense situation.
[time=2604] - What would you like to tell them?
[time=2605] - Thank you, me and dog.
[time=2606] - Why are you so man can hold a Bible?
[time=2609] And who's moon dog?
[time=2611] - It's all right here.
[time=2612] There's good news of great joy.
[time=2614] That will be for all the people.
[time=2616] A sager has been born to you.
[time=2617] He is the Christ Lord, give God the glory.
[time=2621] - Well, there you have it.
[time=2622] Burglars in the store, obviously not.
[time=2625] Voices, just the public address system.
[time=2628] A burglary in progress?
[time=2629] I think not.
[time=2630] A good reporter has a sixth sense about these kind of things.
[time=2633] I knew it all the time.
[time=2635] And if you can hear what I heard, it's that even a dummy can know the good news of Christmas.

[time=2952] (audience applauds) - Let's give them another, they did great.
[time=2971] Good job, guys.
[time=2976] (audience applauds) Yeah, shout it out for the Lord to hear, wonderful one.
[time=2984] - Better believe it.
[time=2986] - Webby and I just want to share a few things before we go.
[time=2989] When I was hearing the music call, I was watching the kids practice a few times.
[time=2992] In this verse, Romans 10, 17, just really kind of grabbed my heart.
[time=2996] Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word about Christ.
[time=3003] And the show that we just watched is called, "Dude, you hear what I hear?" Which took me to the question is, "How is God speaking to me this year?
[time=3010] Am I listening?" And so we just thought it'd be great to ask the question, "How does an all-knowing, all-powerful, all-awesome God speak to us?
[time=3018] How does God speak to us?" And so that took me to Psalm 19, where I think there's a couple ways.
[time=3024] We're going to talk about three.
[time=3025] The first one is he speaks just to what he created.
[time=3029] Let me read, first Psalms 19, one to four.
[time=3032] "The heavens declare the glory of God.
[time=3034] The skies were came in the work of His hands.
[time=3036] Day after day, they pour forth speech.
[time=3038] Night after night, they reveal knowledge.
[time=3041] They have no speech, they use no words, no sound is heard from them, yet their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world." Well, God has created His nature, all the things that we see around us, the wind, the snow, the Grand Canyon, says something about our great God.
[time=3058] It says something about His majesty, His power, His creativity.
[time=3063] It speaks to us, God speaks to us through what He has created.
[time=3067] The birds fly, the universe says something about our great God.
[time=3071] And so also the Psalm continues, doesn't it, Webby?
[time=3074] It talks about the second way that God speaks to us.
[time=3076] Would you share with us about that?
[time=3078] - God speaks to us in His Word.
[time=3080] And I was thinking this week, it's a busy time of year for all of us.
[time=3086] If I hear that word busy one more time, I think I'm just going to have to sit down for a while.
[time=3091] But we're, it's just a terribly busy time of year.
[time=3094] And easy to miss Jesus, you miss the baby and the manger.
[time=3098] It's easy to miss the story that you know.
[time=3100] It's so, we're going to read in a minute from Luke two, that you guys have heard that before.
[time=3104] Everyone has, it's very easy to miss it, just to skate right past it.
[time=3108] And I guess we just wouldn't invite you today just to take a minute and to listen to what God might be saying to you in His Word.
[time=3115] This is Psalm 19 and verse seven.
[time=3117] It says, "The law of the Lord is perfect, refreshing the soul." I just think I need that.
[time=3123] I need that in the middle of December, as much as any time of year, 'cause we're just running all of the place.
[time=3128] There's so much to do.
[time=3130] So these verses are statements about God's Word, but they're also promises to us too.
[time=3135] I just encourage you with ease this morning.
[time=3137] The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.
[time=3142] The praises of the Lord are right giving joy to the heart.
[time=3146] Joy is a Christmas word.
[time=3148] There's things all over our house that say joy on them.
[time=3151] And so it's hard to forget that.
[time=3153] But God's Word provides us endless, no season limited amount of joy.
[time=3158] The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes so we can see.
[time=3163] The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever.
[time=3165] When I give God His proper place, I plug into lasting things.
[time=3170] The decrees of the Lord are firm, and all of them are righteous.
[time=3173] I need a place to stand that's not gonna shift around like my life so often does.
[time=3178] And lastly, there are more precious than gold than much pure gold.
[time=3181] They are sweeter than honey than honey from the honeycomb.
[time=3184] Jesse had watched these kids with their gifts, and we all look forward to getting and receiving gifts.
[time=3191] I don't think we had that perspective though, that God's Word is as precious or more precious than the things that we want, you know, a truck or a robot or whatever it is or a new TV.
[time=3200] God's Word is, describes itself as even more precious than those things.
[time=3204] Buy them as your servant warned and keeping them there is great reward, again, lasting reward that plugs into eternity, to real things, so.
[time=3211] - That's really good, really good.
[time=3213] It's His love letter to us, and it just speaks to us.
[time=3216] So He speaks in His through His creation.
[time=3217] He speaks to us through His holy Word, His scriptures, His they make us wise, they bring us joy, they give light to our eyes.
[time=3225] And I think it's great when you're facing a decision or something happens in life, and God just gives you a verse or a passage.
[time=3231] And there's just something about God speaking to us through His Word that just gives a step, right, to that security that we know that God's Word is true and it's not gonna change and He is there and He has promised things in that Word that apply to us even today.
[time=3244] I think it's awesome.
[time=3245] And I think the greatest way that God has spoken to us is found in Hebrews one, one to two.
[time=3251] In the past, God spoke to our ancestors, through the prophets at many times and in various ways.
[time=3256] But in these last days, He has spoken to us by His Son.
[time=3264] Whom He appointed heir of all things, and through whom also He made the universe.
[time=3269] The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His being.
[time=3276] Don't miss that.
[time=3278] Sustaining all things by His powerful Word.
[time=3281] After He provided purifications for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the majesty in heaven.
[time=3287] The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His being and that is how God speaks to us in these last days.
[time=3298] Through His Son, Jesus Christ.
[time=3300] But before He sat down and provided that purification, He came to the manger.
[time=3306] Well, would you read Luke two for us?
[time=3308] - Absolutely.
[time=3309] Familiar verses, friends, I just invite you to hear them this morning as though you're hearing them for the first time.
[time=3315] And marvel that God came to be with us.
[time=3320] I think sometimes we miss that.
[time=3321] You know, that God becoming a man is one thing, but He didn't have to do that.
[time=3325] He could have come like a strapping young man, like Jesse Hannah, and just showed up in Jerusalem.
[time=3331] - Better than bad.
[time=3332] - It would have been great.
[time=3336] But He came as a baby.
[time=3337] He came in the most vulnerable way possible.
[time=3339] He came in the most inconspicuous way possible.
[time=3343] And that's an amazing statement about the kind of God that we serve.
[time=3347] And it's an amazing statement about, I think Christmas, that this baby boy is providing salvation for the world.
[time=3353] It's a remarkable thing.
[time=3355] Hear these words, friends, as though you're hearing them for the first time today.
[time=3359] In those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
[time=3366] This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.
[time=3372] And everyone went to their own town to register.
[time=3375] So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea to Bethlehem, the town of David, because he belonged to the house and the line of David.
[time=3385] He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him, and was expecting a child.
[time=3391] While they were there, the time came for the baby, the baby to be born.
[time=3395] And she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.
[time=3398] She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger because there was no guest room available for them.
[time=3405] And as I were those verses this morning, I was struck by those names, like Caesar Augustus and Quirinius, which don't mean that much to you, maybe, but the Christian faith, friends, it's rooted in history.
[time=3418] These things really did happen.
[time=3419] And there's no way to read Luke chapter two without seeing that.
[time=3423] I encourage you with that this morning.
[time=3425] There was a kid's musical here today.
[time=3427] Christmas is really about children in lots of ways.
[time=3430] But these are not just stories that we tell our kids.
[time=3433] The Bible believes itself to be true that he's the exact representation of God's being.
[time=3438] What I had this morning on at home before I came in, some Christmas music.
[time=3443] Would you just stop and listen to the words of some Christmas hymns as we sing them in the coming weeks?
[time=3447] Just stop and listen and hear from God there.
[time=3449] But one thing that was said was in "Hark the Herald Angels" saying, there's a line that says, "Hail the incarnate deity." I just stopped.
[time=3457] It's like, wow, that's an amazing statement.
[time=3459] That's what Christmas is all about.
[time=3462] Charlie Brown Christmas, that beautiful little truth, hidden away there.
[time=3467] I love that.
[time=3468] So that's what Christmas is all about.
[time=3469] That story to us is really about a larger story about the way God feels.
[time=3473] As you said, the way God feels about us.
[time=3474] The way God has chosen to show that to us.
[time=3477] It's a remarkable thing.
[time=3478] - That's fantastic.
[time=3479] We're very thankful that he did.
[time=3480] So God speaks to us through his creation.
[time=3482] All that he has created, he speaks to us through his Word and he speaks to us through his Son, Jesus Christ.
[time=3487] And so I guess my question to you guys, today as we consider the season where we're at, is are we listening?
[time=3493] Are we making time through the busyness and all the chaos of what Christmas and holiday and going from one house to the next and presents and trees and lights and malls and everything else that we have to do?
[time=3505] Are we listening?
[time=3506] Are we taking time to sit at the feet of our Savior and just listen to what he has to say?
[time=3511] 'Cause he's speaking to us in so many ways.
[time=3514] What is he saying to us, to me, to you, about your marriage?
[time=3519] What's he saying?
[time=3520] What's he saying about your kids?
[time=3523] Your struggles, your job loss or your new job?
[time=3526] What's he saying to you about your sickness or your health?
[time=3529] What's he saying to you about your money or your future?
[time=3533] What is Jesus saying to you today?
