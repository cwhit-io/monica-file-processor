[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] >> Well, good morning, everyone.
[time=35] Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=37] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=38] I love to be part of the team here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=41] I love that you're watching.
[time=42] I love that you're part of our family.
[time=44] We hope that this season has been an encouragement to you.
[time=48] For years and years, what we call CWB or Christmas with Black Hawk has been a highlight of our calendar, and this year has been no exception.
[time=57] What you're going to see this morning is the last of our services with CWB attached to it.
[time=63] You're going to see drama.
[time=65] You're going to hear from the choir.
[time=67] You're going to hear from my friend Jesse Hannah again on the word on Christmas.
[time=72] Some things that we've been thinking about this season that I wanted to encourage you with this morning as we move our way through the season.
[time=81] First of all, I just say this to you.
[time=83] When the angels appeared to all the different characters in the Christmas story, Mary and Joseph, they said, "Don't be afraid to shepherds.
[time=92] Don't be afraid." It's the most frequently given command in the Bible is, "Don't be afraid." I've always been really amazed by that.
[time=99] Then I thought about Psalm 56, which is the psalmist saying, "I will not be afraid what can man do to me." As the psalm moves along, it says that God holds all of our tears in a bottle, that all of our sufferings, that all of our struggles matter to him, that he is weighing them all, that he cares about us in that way.
[time=119] Then furthermore, says that God is not only with us at Christmas, but that God is for us.
[time=126] What a beautiful truth that is.
[time=128] I want to encourage you with that today, that the scriptures old and New Testament affirm the fact that Christmas, of course, is about God being with us, but it also affirms that God is for us, that God cares about us in that way.
[time=140] All of our sufferings, all of our tears matter to him.
[time=145] So whenever you're facing in the New Year, whenever you're facing over the holiday season, we encourage you this morning that you can face it knowing that God is with you, that God is for you, and that he will never leave.
[time=156] As our Savior, Jesus said, "He will never leave us or forsake us." What a beautiful truth that is.
[time=163] We're looking forward to the New Year, where the time is marching on.
[time=166] We want to let you know it's something very, very important coming up as the New Year turns over.
[time=170] Starting on January 4th, our first Sunday of the New Year, we're moving to one worship service at 1045.
[time=179] We've had two worship services for many, many years.
[time=183] Starting on January 4th, we're going to one worship service, one gathering in our sanctuary at 1045.
[time=189] At nine o'clock, there'll be opportunities for community.
[time=192] It's our community hour.
[time=194] So we've talked many, many times with you and with our people here in the room about the importance of community.
[time=201] And so this is a chance for us to really put our money where our mouth is, and we have decided that nine o'clock hour is going to be dedicated to community, dedicated to being together in smaller settings.
[time=213] As Jesse, who you'll hear from this morning, has told us before, circles are better than rows.
[time=218] So this is an opportunity for you to come together in that way, to find encouragement, to find community, to find strength in that mutual bonding together.
[time=229] Nine o'clock hour, everything will be operating as it has always operated before.
[time=233] Everything available for the kids through 5th grade, all through both services.
[time=237] So that won't change, but we will seek the unity, the strength, the encouragement that comes from us all being together in the room, for one worship service, starting in January 4th, moving forward.
[time=248] We're really excited about it.
[time=249] We're excited about the community focus that's going to bring, about the unity it's going to provide, the encouragement it's going to provide, and really just the energy that we're going to feel, having all been together in that room on Sunday morning.
[time=263] Would you please come join us in the coming days?
[time=265] Please come be with us.
[time=266] Come say hello.
[time=267] Tell us that you're watching.
[time=268] Thank you for being, again, a part of our family.
[time=270] Thank you for your years of dedicated membership with us in this way,
[time=277] partnering with us.
[time=278] Thank you for that.
[time=279] I pray God's blessings on you in the coming days.
[time=282] Please come see us.
[time=284] Thank you for watching.
[time=284] Have a great day.
[time=314] [MUSIC - 151 seconds]
[time=485] Amen. All righty. All right, let's sing my soul, my soul magnifies the Lord. You should know,
[time=496] this one we've been singing it for the past few. Sundays, my soul magnifies the Lord.
[time=516] [MUSIC - 230 seconds]
[time=761] Hey Ben.
[time=770] [MUSIC - 173 seconds]
[time=950] (audience applauds)
[time=960] Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and children of all ages,
[time=966] gather round for we are tellers of tales.
[time=970] With a story to be told.
[time=971] Yes, and it appears that yet again we've all gathered here, both you and we and we and you.
[time=979] Therefore we present you for your entertainment and pleasure, your enlightenment and celebration, the greatest tale that has ever been told.
[time=987] About a hero who comes from a faraway land to win back his lost treasure.
[time=993] About a brave prince who leaves his palace.
[time=996] His most royal throne, he leaves it all behind.
[time=999] Also he can rescue the one he loves.
[time=1002] And it is the most wonderful of fairy tales that has come true in real life.
[time=1007] You see, our tale is actually many stories that together tell one story.
[time=1013] Oh, but the best thing about this story, it's true.
[time=1017] 100% undeniably true.
[time=1020] And right in the middle of this real-life fairy tale is a baby.
[time=1025] But this is no ordinary baby.
[time=1028] He is the missing piece of the puzzle.
[time=1030] A piece that makes all the other pieces fit together in one beautiful picture.
[time=1034] This is the child on which everything would depend.
[time=1037] This is a child that would one date.
[time=1040] We mustn't get ahead of ourselves.
[time=1042] For our tale this morning begins where all good stories begin.
[time=1045] Right at the very beginning.
[time=1047] In the beginning, there was nothing.
[time=1050] Nothing to hear.
[time=1053] Nothing to feel.
[time=1055] Only emptiness and darkness.
[time=1059] But God had a wonderful plan.
[time=1061] Out of the nothing, I will make everything.
[time=1064] God hovered over the deep, silent darkness and spoke life.
[time=1070] Whatever he said happened.
[time=1072] Earth.
[time=1074] He whispered.
[time=1075] And out of the nothing came the foundation for our world.
[time=1079] Light.
[time=1081] And through the darkness came a brilliant light.
[time=1085] Sea and sky.
[time=1087] And a great space opened up wide and deep, filling with water and air.
[time=1093] Now land.
[time=1096] Suddenly, up to the oceans came towering mountains and great plains.
[time=1103] Trees, grass, and flowers.
[time=1106] Everything, everywhere burst into life.
[time=1111] And now the sun and moon.
[time=1113] He separated the day from the night and gave us the seasons.
[time=1118] Creatures large and small.
[time=1121] God filled the land sky and sea with amazing creatures.
[time=1127] He saw all that he had made and he loved them.
[time=1131] But he was not finished.
[time=1133] God had an amazing dream in his heart.
[time=1136] He would make people to share his forever happiness.
[time=1139] They would be his children.
[time=1142] And the world would be their perfect hope.
[time=1144] God breathed life into Adam and Eve.
[time=1147] So all of creation joined together and sang a wonderful song of love to the one who made them.
[time=1153] God looked at his work and said, It is good.
[time=1157] And it was.
[time=1160] God loved his children.
[time=1161] Whatever happened.
[time=1163] Whatever it cost.
[time=1164] He would always love them.
[time=1166] Always.
[time=1168] He would move heaven and earth to be with them, which is exactly what he did.
[time=1173] For soon, his wonderful creation would be deceived.
[time=1177] Adam and Eve turned from God and his heart was broken.
[time=1182] Sin came into the world and his children would be separated from him forever.
[time=1186] They would forget him and they would run.
[time=1189] But deep in their hearts, they would long for him.
[time=1192] In another story, it would all be over.
[time=1196] And that would have been the end.
[time=1197] But remember, God loved his children.
[time=1201] He loved them with a relentless, unbreakable, always and forever love.
[time=1207] And God had a plan.
[time=1209] One day, he promised to bring his children back.
[time=1213] So he set in motion.
[time=1215] The only plan that could save and redeem his children.
[time=1219] When the time was right, he himself would come.
[time=1222] Many years passed and all the while God was watching over his children.
[time=1230] Finally, the time had come.
[time=1232] Everything was ready.
[time=1234] The moment God had been waiting for was here at last.
[time=1237] God was coming to save his children just as he had promised in the very beginning.
[time=1242] But how would he come?
[time=1243] And what would he be like?
[time=1246] What would he do?
[time=1248] He could have made the mountains bow down before him.
[time=1251] He could have come down like fired her from the sky, shaking the very foundations of the earth.
[time=1257] But when no one was looking into the darkness, he came in a most unlikely way.
[time=1263] Mary was a young girl engaged to be married.
[time=1266] God sent the angel Gabriel, a warrior of light as his messenger.
[time=1271] He sent them with the most important of messages.
[time=1275] When she saw him, she fell to her knees in fear.
[time=1278] Don't be afraid, Mary, I bring you a message.
[time=1284] You have found favor in the eyes of God.
[time=1290] You're going to have a child.
[time=1292] His name is to be Jesus, for he is God's own son.
[time=1297] He is the one.
[time=1299] He is the rescuer.
[time=1302] The God who created the universe.
[time=1304] The God who breathed life into existence.
[time=1307] The God who could do anything at all was making himself small and entering this broken world as a baby.
[time=1314] This is all too wonderful.
[time=1317] How can this be true?
[time=1319] Is there anything too wonderful for God?
[time=1322] I am God's servant.
[time=1324] Whatever he says, I will do.
[time=1328] And so Mary trusted God with more than what her eyes could see.
[time=1333] And she believed.
[time=1335] But in case you had forgotten, Mary was already engaged to be married to a man named Joseph.
[time=1342] But when Joseph found out, he was a bit surprised.
[time=1345] Well, what am I supposed to say, Mary?
[time=1349] You're pregnant and we're not even married.
[time=1351] What are people going to say?
[time=1356] Look, I just, I need some time to think about all this.
[time=1360] Joseph was an honorable man and had planned to break off the engagement quietly.
[time=1365] But that night, Gabriel came to Joseph.
[time=1368] Joseph, Joseph, don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife.
[time=1375] God has given her this child.
[time=1377] He's coming to save his people.
[time=1384] So Joseph took Mary as his wife.
[time=1386] But sure enough, it was just as the angel said.
[time=1389] Nine months later, Mary was about ready to have her baby.
[time=1393] But because of the great census, Mary and Joseph had to travel nearly 80 miles on foot to Bethlehem.
[time=1399] And when they got there, they simply could not find a place to stay.
[time=1402] Excuse me, do you have any rooms?
[time=1407] You see my wife is pregnant and she's going to give birth any...
[time=1410] Sorry, we're all full here.
[time=1412] You might try down the road.
[time=1414] Yes.
[time=1414] Hi, I was wondering if you had any rooms.
[time=1420] Yeah, we don't have any room.
[time=1421] It has been that way for weeks.
[time=1422] But we don't need...
[time=1423] Look at, are you listening to me?
[time=1424] I said no room.
[time=1426] You wouldn't happen to have any rooms, would you?
[time=1433] Not with this census going on.
[time=1436] I've even got people staying at my own house completely sold out.
[time=1440] What am I going to do?
[time=1444] Look, my wife is pregnant and she's going to give birth any minute now.
[time=1448] Surely there's some place we can stay anything.
[time=1451] Well, I might have something.
[time=1453] Mind you, it's not the kind of place that you want to have a baby, but it looks like you don't have much of a choice, do you?
[time=1460] Thank you. We'll take anything.
[time=1462] I've got a stable out back.
[time=1463] You're welcome to stay there.
[time=1464] You'll have to stay with the animals, but at least still to put a roof over your heads.
[time=1468] Oh, thank you so much.
[time=1470] You have no idea what this means.
[time=1472] And they're in the stable amongst the animals.
[time=1475] In the quiet of the night, the Lord gave the world his most wonderful gift.
[time=1480] And as Mary and Joseph stood there in the silence of the night, staring at this amazing miracle, they gazed in wonder at God's greatest gift, wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.
[time=1494] His name will be Jesus.
[time=1497] Emmanuel.
[time=1498] God with us.
[time=1502] (Music)
[time=1526] Today a child is born on earth.
[time=1539] In the glory of God shines everywhere for all of the world.
[time=1550] Jesus born on this day.
[time=1569] He is the king of all nations.
[time=1576] He holds the Lamb of God has come.
[time=1591] The Savior is born.
[time=1595] Sing of His love to everyone.
[time=1601] Jesus born on this day.
[time=1607] Heavenly child in a manger.
[time=1613] Oh Jesus born on this day.
[time=1620] He is our Lord and our Savior.
[time=1628] Today our hearts rejoice in His.
[time=1641] Today the light of His birth fills us with hope and brings peace on earth.
[time=1652] Jesus born on this day.
[time=1657] He is our light and salvation.
[time=1663] Oh Jesus born on this day.
[time=1672] He is the king of all nations.
[time=1679] Today a child is born on earth.
[time=1692] Today the glory of God shines everywhere for all of the world.
[time=1702] He is the king of all the world.
[time=1706] He is the king of all nations.
[time=1729] Born on this day.
[time=1739] Oh this may seem like the end of our story.
[time=1754] It is most certainly not an ending.
[time=1758] But a new beginning and it is only one of many to come.
[time=1762] For while everything we have shown you thus far has been leading to the birth of God's only son.
[time=1767] His life leads to yet another ending, another culmination, another most important part of
[time=1774] this story.
[time=1775] Another part of the story to which all other stories including this one have been leading up to.
[time=1780] For his birth leads to his death when they came to the place of the skull there they
[time=1788] crucified him and his death leads to his life.
[time=1792] Don't be afraid he said I know you're looking for Jesus who was crucified.
[time=1798] He isn't here.
[time=1799] He has risen from the dead and his life leads to your life, your life, your life.
[time=1807] For God's soul loved the world that he gave his one and only son so that whoever believes in him will not die but will have eternal life.
[time=1816] You see my friends what you must realize, what you must know is that this story has no
[time=1823] ending.
[time=1824] The story doesn't end with Jesus lying as a baby in a manger.
[time=1828] No one does it end with Jesus hanging on a cross.
[time=1832] For he stands.
[time=1834] A live still.
[time=1836] Arms stretched out to you.
[time=1840] Where will you have the story end?
[time=1843] Where will the Jesus of Christmas end up for you?
[time=1846] Safe and sound just a baby in a manger or a perfect God who still seeks his children.
[time=1855] And so the question we lay before you is where did the story of Christmas end up for you, the answer truly lies with you.
[time=1890] Fear not always triumph, for there is peace still to come.
[time=1920] But for to break the silence, I promise yet to move.
[time=1936] I promise to redeem us, want to free us, break the silence, break the violence in our hearts.
[time=1955] I promise to redeem us, break the silence, break the silence, break the silence, break the
[time=1971] silence, break the silence, break the silence, break the silence, break the silence, break
[time=1996] [MUSIC - 114 seconds]
[time=2136] - Yeah, this is good. It's your privilege and honor to be here this morning.
[time=2141] It is humbling to get to stand in this stage
[time=2150] and to speak to you about such an important message this morning.
[time=2154] Christmas comes and goes every year, and I think sometimes we forget, we lose sight of the fact that when Jesus came to the planet, it was good news.
[time=2165] And it is good news.
[time=2168] I just want to start Luke chapter two.
[time=2170] It says this, "An angel of the Lord appeared to them in the glory of the Lord shown all around them, and they were terrified." The angel said to them, "Do not be afraid, I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.
[time=2184] Today in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you, that he is the Messiah, the Lord." And I don't know why some of you are here, some of you came because you needed to come to make mom and dad happy.
[time=2196] Some of you came because your wife said, "We're going to church.
[time=2199] Let's go get in the car." Some of you are not even sure why you're here.
[time=2204] You just found yourself here today.
[time=2208] And maybe some of you in the room have had some poor or bad experiences with Christians or maybe churches, and you've been hurt, confused, and maybe you're just angry, and you've kind of walked away.
[time=2220] You've said, "I'm not having any more of that." If you're watching at home or you're listening online, maybe that's you.
[time=2226] You're just having no more of that.
[time=2228] And to you, when I say good news, you're like, "It's far from good news.
[time=2231] It's not good news." But I'd like to take an opportunity to remind us that it is good news when it's the real message that's behind the good news, not the stuff that you forget and, you know, reject it or have been hurt by, but the real good news.
[time=2248] So I would just like, if you would just give me the opportunity to restate what the good news really is, and then at the end, you can decide.
[time=2257] If I can do that, I would really appreciate it.
[time=2260] So as we move from the manger, baby Jesus born to us, to adult Jesus,
[time=2266] we kind of, there's a little chapter three in John.
[time=2269] There's this conversation that Jesus is having with this guy named Nicodemus.
[time=2274] Now Nicodemus is a religious professional.
[time=2277] He's a Pharisee. He's on the high.
[time=2279] He just knows his stuff.
[time=2282] And Jesus, having this conversation in the whole focus of this passage, is life changed or transformation from God above.
[time=2290] And Nicodemus has this idea.
[time=2292] He's got it a little off from what Jesus is talking about.
[time=2295] Nicodemus wants to do this thing called works.
[time=2297] He wants to climb in the ladder.
[time=2299] He wants to go after. He wants the boxes to check.
[time=2302] He's trying to do it on his own.
[time=2304] He thinks that's how he can get into God's good graces.
[time=2308] But that's not good news.
[time=2315] Now some of you here, maybe you've said this.
[time=2317] You and God, you say, "Oh, you don't want me to come to your church." It might burn down.
[time=2324] Maybe you've said that.
[time=2325] Maybe you've had a friend say that to you.
[time=2327] Like, "Oh, I could never come to that church.
[time=2329] I could never go there." I think, Nicodemus, I think sometimes we lose sight of what the good news is really all about.
[time=2336] Nicodemus just doesn't quite understand.
[time=2338] Jesus talks about this born-again term.
[time=2341] You must be born again.
[time=2343] And Nicodemus, how can I climb back up in my mother's womb?
[time=2347] He's just not quite getting it.
[time=2350] He's so confused.
[time=2351] And maybe like us, we just have the wrong idea of what faith in Christ and church is all about.
[time=2356] It's not about performance.
[time=2358] It's not about being good or doing enough works or having the right clothes or the right bank account or going to the right church.
[time=2366] It has nothing to do with that.
[time=2368] And in the middle of this conversation, Jesus kind of, I think, lays out the good news.
[time=2375] I think in the middle of this conversation with Nicodemus, who's just quite can't figure it out, he lays down this conversation, which he just lays it out, and he starts like this.
[time=2384] John records it as like this.
[time=2386] In the middle of this conversation with Nicodemus, he says, "For God so loved the world."
[time=2396] "For God so loved the world." And you saw it in the drama, "See, God loved." And under that love, he created all things.
[time=2405] He created everything.
[time=2406] He created man and woman.
[time=2407] He created them good, and they could walk with God, and they could talk with God, and they could be a relationship with God.
[time=2414] But they turned their back on God.
[time=2415] They decided to trust in not God.
[time=2418] And his protective rules, the things that he did to protect them, they trusted in themselves, and everything fell apart.
[time=2424] But God doesn't end there.
[time=2426] He didn't quit.
[time=2427] He kept going.
[time=2428] He said, "No, you know what?
[time=2429] I'm going to take care of this for now." And he made a provision.
[time=2433] He made a way so that they could kind of still be in a relationship with God.
[time=2437] So fast forward, fast forward.
[time=2439] For God so loved the world.
[time=2441] This is what he's been doing all throughout human history.
[time=2444] He intervened.
[time=2445] He stepped in.
[time=2446] For God so loved.
[time=2448] He didn't wipe us out.
[time=2449] He didn't quit there.
[time=2450] He kept going.
[time=2451] For God so loved.
[time=2453] And we understand that he gave.
[time=2457] For God so loved that he gave.
[time=2460] The only thing that could take away our sins.
[time=2463] The only provision that was there for us to be in relationship with God, he gave.
[time=2467] He didn't hold back.
[time=2468] He didn't destroy us.
[time=2469] He didn't breathe fire.
[time=2471] He didn't give us rules or tasks or an eight step program.
[time=2476] He didn't give us what we deserved.
[time=2480] For God so loved the world that he gave.
[time=2483] His one and only son.
[time=2490] His one and only son he gave.
[time=2496] He didn't have to, could have wiped us out.
[time=2500] But he didn't.
[time=2501] He made away his one and only son.
[time=2505] The name under which all mankind must be saved.
[time=2508] Jesus is before all things.
[time=2510] And him all things hold together.
[time=2512] The very pews that you're sitting in are held together by Christ.
[time=2515] The air that you're breathing in your lungs is held together by Jesus Christ.
[time=2519] His sustaining power.
[time=2521] All of those things.
[time=2522] He was the first born among the dead so that everything he might have supremacy.
[time=2526] For God was pleased.
[time=2527] Listen to this.
[time=2528] For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him.
[time=2534] And through him to reconcile to himself all things.
[time=2538] Whether on earth or things in heaven by making peace through his blood shed on a cross.
[time=2544] And through that therefore now there is no more condemnation for those who are in Christ.
[time=2551] Because what Jesus has done there is no condemnation.
[time=2555] Therefore there is now no more condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[time=2559] Because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.
[time=2566] It's not works.
[time=2567] It's not do your best.
[time=2568] It's not get there on your own.
[time=2571] It's about Jesus.
[time=2573] For God so loved the world that he gave.
[time=2577] His one and only son.
[time=2580] That whoever.
[time=2582] Whoever.
[time=2584] Don't miss that.
[time=2586] That whoever.
[time=2587] See the good news is that Jesus came to reveal a God who defines us not by our actions but by his love.
[time=2594] I'm going to read it again because I don't know if you heard me.
[time=2597] The good news is that Jesus came to reveal a God who defines us not by our actions but by his love.
[time=2606] For God so loved the world that he gave.
[time=2610] His one and only son.
[time=2612] So that whoever.
[time=2615] Whoever.
[time=2618] Jesus loves us right now just as we are.
[time=2621] He's not standing in heaven saying figure it out.
[time=2624] Clean yourselves up.
[time=2625] Then you'll be worthy of me.
[time=2627] No, no, no.
[time=2628] He comes down.
[time=2629] He waits deep into the muck and mess and nastiness of sin and life and just everything the crappy stuff on this earth.
[time=2636] And he says, I love you.
[time=2638] You don't have to be worthy of me because I'm going to wait way deep in with you.
[time=2643] And I'm going to get into life and help the broken rescue the lost and heal the sick.
[time=2649] That's what Jesus does.
[time=2650] No sinners are irreparable or irredeemable.
[time=2653] No sin is too great that the blood of Jesus cannot cover it.
[time=2657] Whoever, regardless of your status in life, your sins, your past, your present, your future.
[time=2662] He is come to forgive you, your past, your present and your future.
[time=2667] That's what Jesus come.
[time=2668] For God so loved the world that he gave.
[time=2674] He gave.
[time=2676] This is the God who created all things.
[time=2681] He gave as one and only son that whoever, and it doesn't matter if you're rich, poor, black, white, free or not.
[time=2691] The whoever's in the balcony, the whoever's in these pews, the whoever's in our nation prisons, the whoever's in America, the whoever's in Africa, the whoever's on planet earth.
[time=2701] Whoever. It's good news, Luke 2. It's good news for all people.
[time=2708] For God so loved the world that he gave.
[time=2715] Jesus gave us Jesus.
[time=2720] It's one and only son.
[time=2730] Whoever believes in him.
[time=2732] Stop me anytime and tell me when it is becoming bad news.
[time=2737] This is all good news.
[time=2741] This believes in it.
[time=2742] It's like a trust sin.
[time=2743] You have this thing called faith or trust.
[time=2745] When you place it, when you take it and you decide and you say, "I'm going to trust in Christ." You kind of sit in the chair.
[time=2752] You relax all of your weight.
[time=2753] You kind of move completely forward.
[time=2755] You step across the line.
[time=2756] You say, "I'm going to trust all of this, all of me into Christ."
[time=2762] It's not just believe that Jesus existed.
[time=2764] It's not just believe that he was a good guy or did some cool stuff.
[time=2767] It's believing that what he did on the cross is sufficient for you and your sin that needs to be paid
[time=2774] and stepping across the line and say, "Jesus, I'm going to trust you.
[time=2777] Believe in him for God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son so that whoever
[time=2787] believes in him trusts in him shall not perish."
[time=2796] Do you hear that?
[time=2798] Life never ends.
[time=2803] Shall not perish.
[time=2805] Shall not.
[time=2807] Shall not perish.
[time=2808] Go on.
[time=2809] Keep living with God in relationship with God.
[time=2814] That's good news.
[time=2816] Shall not perish.
[time=2818] But have eternal life and Jesus gives us a rock solid definition for eternal life.
[time=2822] John 17-3.
[time=2823] Now this is eternal life that they may know you, the only true God in Jesus Christ whom you have sent,
[time=2830] that they may know.
[time=2832] We even talked about heaven yet.
[time=2836] So often I think we get confusing.
[time=2838] I need Jesus so I go to heaven.
[time=2840] False.
[time=2841] I mean that's true.
[time=2842] But you get to know Jesus so you can have a relationship with God.
[time=2847] That's eternal life.
[time=2849] That's the beauty of it.
[time=2851] You get to have a relationship with God.
[time=2853] Remember in the garden?
[time=2854] They knew God.
[time=2855] They walked with God.
[time=2857] They had a relationship with God.
[time=2859] That's what Jesus restores and brings back again.
[time=2863] We can know God.
[time=2865] We can be in relationship with God.
[time=2872] For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son.
[time=2880] So that whoever, whoever believes in him, whoever believes in him, you don't have to get clean.
[time=2891] You don't have to come here perfect.
[time=2895] You don't have to worry about last night or last week.
[time=2901] You just get to trust in Jesus.
[time=2904] For God so loved the world that he gave.
[time=2908] So far we haven't heard anything about getting cleaned up or getting straight before God.
[time=2912] And I think sometimes religious professionals, some of you might be quote unquote in that term, we get lost too.
[time=2920] We think it's about our church attendance or how much we give or how often we read the
[time=2926] Bible or if we're in a small group or not.
[time=2930] See that's not it either.
[time=2932] For God so loved the world he didn't give his church.
[time=2935] He gave us his son.
[time=2937] And when we're trusting in our efforts, our performance, we've missed it.
[time=2942] We've lost sight of what the message of Christmas is all about.
[time=2945] If you take the mass off Christmas, it's Christ.
[time=2948] It's kind of like Superman, right?
[time=2950] Take the glasses on here.
[time=2951] Who is that?
[time=2952] Take some off Superman.
[time=2954] You take the mass off Christmas, go, oh, I never saw that before, it's Christ.
[time=2959] That's the message.
[time=2960] It's good news.
[time=2963] The implication is this, if you've ever felt condemned by Christians or the church, you
[time=2973] got the wrong message.
[time=2974] It was sent wrong.
[time=2975] Auto text was broken.
[time=2981] That's not good news.
[time=2982] God did not send his son into the world to shake his finger at us, to shame us, to tell
[time=2990] us how terrible we are.
[time=2992] He didn't come into the world to turn his back on the world, he came to save.
[time=2997] He came to save for God so loved, so loved the world that he gave.
[time=3009] The most precious thing that he could give, the only way for us to be in relationship with God again is through his son, Jesus Christ, that whoever believes in him, whoever trusts
[time=3021] in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.
[time=3028] That goes for me, that goes for you, that goes for anybody, the whoever's, and all the
[time=3035] world that's ever lived, that's the good news of Christmas, that's the good news of Easter,
[time=3042] that's the good news of Halloween, you name the holiday, the good news never stops, it's
[time=3048] not just Christmas, and the angel is right, this is good news, today I ask you this question,
[time=3059] has there ever been a time in your life when you've placed your trust in Jesus Christ,
[time=3066] for God so loved, it's good news, that's the real good news, not this other stuff that
[time=3073] may be rejected, you started to stop trusting in you and your goodness and I'm a nice person or if I just do these things I should be good, that'll be, that should be enough, because as long as we are trusting in us, we never know how much is good enough, we never know
[time=3091] what's good enough, if it's about us, then Jesus did need to die on the cross, but it's
[time=3099] about him and his work on the cross and us trusting in that, so I want to take away
[time=3106] the unknown, if it's unknown in your life you're like I'm not really sure why I stand with God, today you can, today you can, as the band comes back up, here's how you can
[time=3120] know, remember what the good news is, for God so loved the world that he gave, is one and only son, so that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life,
[time=3132] when you trust in Jesus, number one when you place your trust in Jesus Christ, not your
[time=3138] bank account, not your baptism, not your church attendance, not your sins or your good deeds or anything in between, when you place all of your trust in Jesus Christ, you can know
[time=3150] that you're in with Jesus and you can have that eternal life, you can know God, and
[time=3156] you know, and you never have to doubt ever again, that that's what's true, you never have to ever, ever, ever doubt again, if you're in with God, if you know God because it says
[time=3169] for God so loved, that he gave, so whoever believes in trusts in him shall not perish
[time=3175] for have eternal life, that's what it's about, it's about Jesus Christ, that's the real good news, that's the real good news, let's pray, God we are so thankful and humbled that
[time=3194] you would pursue us like that, that your love is so great, that you so loved, that you
[time=3204] gave us your son so that we can have a way to know you the one true God, God I pray for
[time=3213] us in this room, if we are unsure where we stand with God, may we just pray, God I place
[time=3221] my trust in you today, this Christmas season, this is a year, I place all of my trust in
[time=3227] you again, maybe it's the first time, maybe it's refocusing, but I'm going to have trust
[time=3233] in you God, because it's really silly to trust in myself, because you went to such lengths
[time=3241] to save me, Father I believe that Jesus is the one and only son, I believe he died on
[time=3249] the cross for me, and when I place my trust in you, God I pray you have paid my final payment, my full and final payment, not myself, not my church, not my baptism, my bank account
[time=3260] and my efforts, all of my trust, God Jesus is in you, I pray that today, I pray that for this place, you are God and you are good and you so loved us that you gave, you're one
[time=3272] and only son, amen.
[time=3299] Through the heart of heaven beating, Jesus saves, Jesus saves, and the hush of mercy
[time=3313] breathing, Jesus saves, Jesus saves, you're the host of angels sing, glory to the newborn
[time=3328] King and the sound of joy repeating, Jesus saves, sing the humblest heart to door him,
[time=3346] Jesus saves, Jesus saves, and the wisest vow'll be for him, Jesus saves, Jesus saves, see
[time=3362] the sky alive with praise melting darkness in its blaze, there is life forever more in
[time=3379] our lives, we will live our sorrows share with Jesus saves, Jesus saves, we'll die our
[time=3397] very, Jesus saves, Jesus saves, it is done, we'll shout the cross, Christ is hate,
[time=3412] Jesus saves, Jesus saves, Jesus saves, Jesus saves, Jesus saves, Jesus saves, Jesus saves
