[time=421] [MUSIC]
[time=432] Well, good morning, everyone.
[time=434] Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=435] My name is Steve Webster, and I'm a teaching pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=439] So happy that you're watching.
[time=441] We've made it through the Christmas season here, and at my house, things are winding down.
[time=448] We layer on the house quite a bit with our sweatpants on and our food comas after the rustle and the bustle of the holiday season, so it's good.
[time=459] It's good to take a step back and just be thankful for all that we've experienced.
[time=463] I'm thankful that you're watching and that you've been watching for many, many years, that you're part of our family.
[time=469] As we often do, we want to invite you to come and to be part of our gathering here at the church to physically gather with us.
[time=476] Something about that.
[time=477] Something about physically being together that's a great blessing to us, and I would hope to you as well.
[time=484] And speaking of that, starting on Sunday, January 4th, we're going to go to one gathering service on Sunday mornings that starts at 10.30.
[time=494] We've been announcing to you that it was 10.45, but we moved it up to 10.30.
[time=498] So we're going to have a nine o'clock community hour.
[time=501] We'll be gathering in smaller communities and have a 10.30 gathering in our worship center, one gathering on Sunday morning.
[time=510] We invite you to be part of that.
[time=511] We are excited about the energy.
[time=513] We are excited about the unity that's going to bring, and we're really excited about the fact that now that nine o'clock community hour becomes a focal point.
[time=521] We talk a lot with you and with our people here in the room about the importance of connecting.
[time=527] And so now, I've said it many times over the last few weeks, our money is now where our mouth is.
[time=532] So we encourage you to come and be with us on Sunday morning.
[time=535] Come and nine o'clock.
[time=537] Come find a smaller setting where you can be with people that have similar interests, similar hopes, similar fears.
[time=544] Jesse Hanna, my friend, says that circles are better than rows.
[time=548] And so the nine o'clock hour is for that.
[time=551] And then we gather at 10.30 in the worship center to meet together, to hear from God's word, to sing together praises to our God.
[time=560] So we invite you to be part of all that.
[time=562] We're very excited about it.
[time=563] And we are hopeful about all that 2015 is going to bring.
[time=567] We're also very hopeful and very excited about our CWB.
[time=573] It's done now in a rear view mirror.
[time=575] All things that we experienced in December, it's strange to look back on it now.
[time=578] We've been talking about it for so long, but our kids, our drama program, what a marvelous time we had in December this year, celebrating the birth of our Savior, Jesus.
[time=591] This morning, what you're going to see is a bridge Sunday between CWB and our series and the Holy Spirit starting again in January.
[time=601] So this morning, I thought it would be appropriate for us to talk a little bit about that baby.
[time=606] I didn't stay a baby.
[time=607] He became a man and he came with good news.
[time=610] In a very real way, he was the good news.
[time=613] The gospel about Jesus is that he is himself.
[time=618] His arrival is good news.
[time=620] He didn't stay in that manger.
[time=622] He grew to become a man and he was the son of God.
[time=625] And so it gives me great comfort to know that I can share that with you this morning.
[time=629] That you're going to hear from us about our conviction about the person of Christ, who he is, what his coming represents, and what we are to do now in the light of Christ's coming.
[time=642] So thank you for watching this morning.
[time=645] I would want to wish you a happy new year.
[time=647] We're in 2015 as you're watching this broadcast.
[time=650] Thank you for being a part of our family.
[time=652] Thank you for watching.
[time=653] Please come and see us.
[time=654] Please reach out to us and shoot us a line or call us on the phone and let us know that you're watching.
[time=660] Let us know what you appreciate, what we can do better here at the Bible Hour.
[time=664] Thanks so much, everyone.
[time=665] Have a great day.
[time=666] [MUSIC - 534 seconds]
[time=1207] [APPLAUSE - 6 seconds]
[time=1214] God, we want to thank you this morning.
[time=1216] It's great to see you, God, and like the songs say, God, I know the lyrics are so idealistic.
[time=1221] They're so absolute for us to say that you're all the way, you're all that we need.
[time=1227] And we know that we can't possibly feel that way all the time, God.
[time=1232] And so I just want to use these songs as prayers to you, God.
[time=1236] And as I've said before, it's faith, God, but it's not a blind faith.
[time=1245] You've been proven many, many times to be truthful, to be faithful.
[time=1255] You've been proven that you're worthy of our trust, God.
[time=1260] And if we haven't experienced that already, God would just pray for opportunities to experience that,
[time=1266] to experience why you're trustworthy, why you can be enough for us, God.
[time=1275] Just going to name and pray, Amen.
[time=1278] [MUSIC]
[time=1289] I saw this tweet a couple hours ago, and I retweeted it.
[time=1295] It says, "Singing is a form of exposition that uses poetry to teach the Word of God."
[time=1311] So Crosby stills a Nash, have nothing on Rayber, Osborne, and Jones this morning, so thank you guys for that.
[time=1318] Give them a round of applause, please.
[time=1321] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1324] Eat your hearts out.
[time=1326] Okay.
[time=1327] I just wanted to pause this morning just for a couple minutes.
[time=1332] I told you, I think when I was up here recently, that if I hear one more person and say they're busy, I'm just going to fall down on the ground.
[time=1338] And then somebody caught me saying it.
[time=1341] That's the struggle of being up here, is that people hold you to what you say.
[time=1345] So please keep doing it.
[time=1347] It's easy to say harder to do.
[time=1349] But man, you guys, I just feel busy.
[time=1352] No more so than this past week.
[time=1354] And I want to just take a minute today before we start, take a few minutes, and just invite you to do nothing.
[time=1364] I just want to invite you to sit and to hear what God says.
[time=1369] We sang that song this morning, taking right out of Psalm 121.
[time=1374] So I always want to ask you this to be still for a minute.
[time=1378] The Psalmist says, see striving.
[time=1381] So can I just ask you to close your eyes where you are and just sit?
[time=1386] It's nice to not have to do anything.
[time=1389] And you don't.
[time=1390] I want you to receive this from God.
[time=1394] This is a song that they would sing going up to Jerusalem to offer their praises.
[time=1400] And so I invite you to close your eyes and I invite you to imagine that you are on that road up that hill to give praise and just to be expectant to hear from God today.
[time=1415] I lift up my eyes to the hills from where does my help come?
[time=1421] My help comes from the Lord who made heaven and earth.
[time=1426] He will not let your foot be moved.
[time=1429] He who keeps you will not slumber.
[time=1433] Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
[time=1439] The Lord is your keeper.
[time=1441] The Lord is your shade on your right hand.
[time=1445] The sun shall not strike you by day nor the moon by night.
[time=1451] The Lord will keep you from all evil.
[time=1454] He will keep your life.
[time=1456] The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forever more.
[time=1465] [AMEN] God, I don't know how my friends got here today.
[time=1472] I don't know in what state they walk through those doors.
[time=1476] Perhaps the season God for them is not the most wonderful time of the year.
[time=1482] And I know, God, that there is anxiety in this room about the present and about the future.
[time=1490] I know that there is care and there is worry.
[time=1496] So, God, when we lift our eyes to the hills, we take them off of our circumstances and we
[time=1503] declare by faith that you are what your word says that you are.
[time=1507] You are close.
[time=1511] You are a shade, God, at our right hand.
[time=1515] You are that close.
[time=1517] Thank you, God, for just a few days ago on Christmas Eve, the chance we had to talk about the surpassingly wonderful truth that you are with us, that you are for us, God.
[time=1527] All those tears that we shed, you keep them all in a bottle.
[time=1532] You know us, God, you care for us.
[time=1537] You love us with an everlasting love.
[time=1540] Your word affirms that, God.
[time=1541] We sang it this morning.
[time=1544] We read it now.
[time=1546] God, I just invite my sisters and my brothers this morning to stop just for a few minutes
[time=1552] and to receive from your word the living and powerful active source of life that it is.
[time=1561] God, we rush around.
[time=1563] We rust, rustle and bustle and chase and all these things, God.
[time=1568] We just need to stop sometimes.
[time=1571] And so today, God, would you by your spirit speak to us from your word, the very word that
[time=1578] He illumined and illumines today.
[time=1582] I pray, God, that whatever is needed in this room, that your hand would provide it.
[time=1589] And I thank you for what we've already heard.
[time=1591] I thank you for the chance to be together.
[time=1594] It's good to be together.
[time=1596] Father, thank you for all those things.
[time=1598] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1603] I'm going to read a prayer as we start this morning.
[time=1608] And I want to ask you to close your eyes as we pray.
[time=1612] And I want to ask you that when you find yourself, when you hear yourself in this prayer, this is a prayer that's been prayed by many people across the miles across the years, when I pray this prayer and you find yourself in the prayer, I invite you just to raise your hand.
[time=1628] The Bible is filled up with references to raising your hands in prayer.
[time=1631] And so I just invite you as a sign of acknowledgment that you identify with the words of this prayer,
[time=1637] that when you find yourself in this prayer, that you would raise your hand.
[time=1642] Can we do that this morning as we begin?
[time=1644] Would you by your heads and pray with me?
[time=1646] When you find yourself in this prayer, in this prayer, please raise your hand.
[time=1652] When you identify with something in the prayer, whatever you'd like to do, I just invite you to raise your hand.
[time=1657] We praise you, O God.
[time=1659] We acknowledge you to be the Lord.
[time=1661] All the earth worships you, the Father everlasting.
[time=1665] To you, all angels cry aloud.
[time=1668] The heavens and all the powers therein.
[time=1671] To you, cherubim and seraphim continually cry, holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.
[time=1679] Heaven and earth are full of the majesty of your glory.
[time=1683] The glorious company of the apostles praise you.
[time=1686] The goodly fellowship of the prophets praise you.
[time=1689] The noble army of martyrs praise you.
[time=1692] The holy church throughout all the world acknowledges you.
[time=1696] Father of infinite majesty, your adorable, true and only son, the Holy Spirit, the comforter.
[time=1704] You are the king of glory, O Christ.
[time=1708] You are the everlasting son of the Father.
[time=1711] When you look upon you to deliver man, you humbled yourself to be born of a virgin.
[time=1718] When you overcome the sharpness of death, you open the kingdom of heaven to all believers.
[time=1724] You sit at the right hand of God in the glory of the Father.
[time=1729] We believe that you will come to be our judge.
[time=1732] We therefore pray, help your servants, whom you have redeemed with your precious blood.
[time=1738] Make them to be numbered with your saints in glory everlasting.
[time=1743] O Lord, save your people and bless your heritage.
[time=1747] Govern them, lift them up forever, day by day we magnify you, we worship your name forever.
[time=1755] Vouch safe, O Lord, to keep us this day without sin.
[time=1759] O Lord, have mercy on us.
[time=1762] Have mercy on us.
[time=1764] O Lord, let your mercy be upon us as our trust is in you.
[time=1769] O Lord, in you have we trusted.
[time=1772] Let me let us, dear Father, never be confounded.
[time=1777] [AMEN] We're in Mark chapter one this morning.
[time=1783] We're coming out of our Christmas with Blackhawk, the word on Christmas series.
[time=1788] And we're going to start next week, a series in the Holy Spirit.
[time=1791] So we're at a bridge Sunday today.
[time=1794] And I think what we're going to do is going to be a very helpful bridge indeed between those two things.
[time=1799] The word on Christmas and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1802] I come this morning with good news, friends.
[time=1806] Good news as the angels announced, good news of great joy for all people.
[time=1813] That's not just for Christmas.
[time=1815] Don't let those songs, those truths simply live in our hearts at Christmas time.
[time=1821] If you were here a few days ago on Christmas Eve, we talked about that.
[time=1824] In your bulletin, there are some notes and there are some quotes in there.
[time=1828] You guys often ask me for my quotes that I share in the service and now they're in the bulletin.
[time=1832] So you have not because you ask not.
[time=1835] There they are.
[time=1837] This question on Christmas, what child is this?
[time=1842] Remember that?
[time=1843] You all know that song.
[time=1845] That is the most important question that you can ever ask.
[time=1849] Who is Jesus?
[time=1851] Your answer to that question is of infinite, everlasting importance.
[time=1857] And it will affect the way that you live your life.
[time=1860] So we're going to take this week and next week and work our way through the first 15 verses in Mark's Gospel and talk about those two things.
[time=1868] Who is Jesus and what should I do?
[time=1871] We're going to take a journey all throughout the scriptures and let them guide our course of action in terms of what we think about this person, Jesus.
[time=1881] And then in light of that, what we should do in light of what we know about this person,
[time=1887] Jesus.
[time=1888] So let's read Mark 1, 1 to 15.
[time=1891] Let's read down to verse 7 actually this morning, maybe verse 8, just for time's sake and we'll go forward today.
[time=1898] We're in Mark chapter 1.
[time=1899] Mark is between the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke.
[time=1902] Mark is the shortest Gospel.
[time=1904] Mark is probably attached as a Gospel to the person of Peter.
[time=1908] So what we think is John Mark, John Mark is the guy in the Gospels probably in the Garden
[time=1914] of Gethsemane who's following along.
[time=1916] Remember he's wearing a linen sheet.
[time=1919] He gets snatched away and he runs away naked.
[time=1921] Probably John Mark, that's information that you don't need to know.
[time=1925] Anyway, but John Mark is the one who wrote what we call the Gospel of Mark and he wrote this Gospel having traveled around with the Apostle Peter.
[time=1933] So Mark really is Peter's Gospel.
[time=1936] It's the shortest of the Gospels by a long shot, but it's powerful.
[time=1940] And I can't wait to take this week and next week and walk you through this section about what I should do in light of who Jesus is.
[time=1949] Remember, we're going to read Mark 1 verses 1 through 8 this morning chasing those two questions down.
[time=1955] Mark 1, verse 1, the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[time=1962] As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face who
[time=1968] will prepare your way.
[time=1970] The voice of one crying in the wilderness.
[time=1973] Prepare the way of the Lord.
[time=1975] Make his paths straight." John appeared baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for
[time=1985] the forgiveness of sins.
[time=1987] At all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
[time=1996] Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey.
[time=2004] Yikes.
[time=2005] And he preached saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than I.
[time=2010] The strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
[time=2016] I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
[time=2022] This is God's word.
[time=2025] Let's look at your bulletin this morning and on the screens behind me will be this first quote from JB Phillips, New Testament scholar.
[time=2034] I found this to be very, very helpful in answering this question about who is Jesus.
[time=2040] That's a question not only for Christmastime.
[time=2043] It's a question that will guide the course of each and every one of our lives.
[time=2046] It's this morning if you're here and the jury's out on who Jesus is.
[time=2050] There's any number of answers to that question in the world around us.
[time=2054] I invite you this morning to take JB Phillips advice.
[time=2057] You'll hear it for me in just a minute.
[time=2059] And to let your conception of Jesus be shaped by the Bible, I teach a class here at the
[time=2065] school.
[time=2066] A couple of classes a day, these days, one class is in what's called apologetics.
[time=2071] And apologetics as a discipline comes from a Greek word that means to make a defense.
[time=2075] And so basically I'm teaching my students how to make an intelligent defense for the claims of Christianity.
[time=2082] It's a great use of my time.
[time=2083] I love to do it.
[time=2085] And part of the discipline is this.
[time=2087] Most people, that's probably the wrong word.
[time=2090] Many people, maybe in your life, maybe at your table this week, who have a difficult time with biblical Christianity, we found that a lot of people have a hard time with
[time=2100] Christianity, not because of real biblical, authentic Christianity, but because of what some counterfeit version of it that's been lived out badly before.
[time=2109] They've been hurt in the church, for example.
[time=2111] And so you stay far away from me with your Jesus talk.
[time=2114] Can I just encourage you with this?
[time=2117] In the new year, I would encourage you, I would encourage you to encourage other people and start yourself.
[time=2122] You can read the whole Gospel of Mark in about 45 minutes, maybe an hour.
[time=2128] So I know that you have an hour.
[time=2130] And I mentioned before earlier how busy we all are.
[time=2133] And I won't fall off the stage, but I sure want to.
[time=2135] Busy.
[time=2136] I'm just so tired of being busy.
[time=2138] You have an hour.
[time=2141] I hope you have an hour.
[time=2143] If you don't have an hour, God bless you.
[time=2146] But dear friends, take an hour and read Mark's Gospel just as a starting place.
[time=2153] Invite others to read with you and say, can we just answer that question?
[time=2156] Who is this man?
[time=2157] Who is Jesus?
[time=2159] That is a very good use of your time.
[time=2161] This is what JB Phillips said about that.
[time=2163] I would very earnestly ask you to check your conception of Christ.
[time=2169] The things that you think about him.
[time=2171] The image of him, which as a Christian, if you are a Christian, you hold in your mind.
[time=2177] With the actual revealed person who can be seen and studied in action in the pages of
[time=2186] the Gospels, it may be of some value to hold in our minds a bundle of assorted ideals to
[time=2194] influence and control our conduct.
[time=2196] There may be other things that you're reading and other voices you might hear that help you to live your life in a way that you should.
[time=2202] That's true.
[time=2203] But surely you need to be very careful before we give that bundle the name of Jesus Christ,
[time=2210] the Son of God.
[time=2211] If you asked 25 people that first question in your outline, who is Jesus?
[time=2218] You might just very well get 25 different answers.
[time=2222] And they can't all be right.
[time=2225] So my encouragement to you again is to let the scriptures be what they are.
[time=2230] Let them guide your course of action, influencing your thoughts, influencing the way you feel about your circumstances.
[time=2236] I think you'll find great encouragement there.
[time=2240] Look at the first verse of Mark's Gospel.
[time=2246] Here we go.
[time=2247] If this was all we had, it would be amazing, but it's not.
[time=2251] This is just the beginning.
[time=2252] The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[time=2258] I've told you before, I love this analogy, that you know that the Gospel is a word that
[time=2264] means really good news.
[time=2266] If you didn't know that, then circle the word Gospel in your Bibles and write the word good
[time=2272] news somewhere in the margin or write it on your bulletins.
[time=2275] Good news.
[time=2276] It's not good advice.
[time=2278] It's good news.
[time=2279] Let me encourage you with this as well.
[time=2280] I love this analogy.
[time=2282] Tim Keller talks about this.
[time=2284] He says that there is a battle far away, for example.
[time=2288] And the battle far away has been engaged.
[time=2291] And the king doesn't send back to you and die living in the city.
[time=2296] He doesn't send back military advisors and say, hey, archers over here, cavalry over here,
[time=2302] so on and so forth.
[time=2303] He doesn't send back military advisors.
[time=2305] He sends back messengers.
[time=2307] Harold's saying the battle's been won.
[time=2310] It's over.
[time=2311] It's done.
[time=2312] Everything necessary for the victory to be won has already been accomplished.
[time=2317] That's why it's good news.
[time=2320] Not military advisors, dear friends, heralds, messengers.
[time=2325] That's why the Gospel is good news.
[time=2328] It's good news today.
[time=2329] It's been done for you.
[time=2332] You can rest in that this morning.
[time=2335] The beginning of the good news.
[time=2337] What's the good news?
[time=2340] It has been done for you on your behalf.
[time=2343] In a way, it need never be done ever, ever again.
[time=2346] In the most perfect way by the only person who could ever do it.
[time=2351] [AMEN] So you can rest easy.
[time=2355] You don't have to work so hard, my friend Andrew Peterson says.
[time=2361] He's already done it.
[time=2363] So I know what you're facing out there.
[time=2366] It's going to be cold this week, so I'm told.
[time=2370] And in the coldness of the winter, in the bleak midwinter, as the song says, you can rest in that truth that he's faithful and that he's good.
[time=2379] And that will not change despite your circumstances.
[time=2381] This is the beginning of the Gospel.
[time=2383] The good news.
[time=2384] God has come to be with us.
[time=2386] And the good news isn't just about Jesus.
[time=2389] It is about Jesus.
[time=2391] It's what the Scriptures say here.
[time=2392] The Gospel of him is about him, but really it's him.
[time=2397] He is the good news.
[time=2399] He is the Gospel himself.
[time=2402] Jesus Christ, Christ, you might know, is the Greek form of the word Messiah that you might be more familiar with.
[time=2409] It's the same word.
[time=2410] How they understood that term to be, the one who would come to save us.
[time=2416] So what does Mark said?
[time=2417] It's good news.
[time=2419] What's the good news?
[time=2420] Christ has come.
[time=2422] Messiah has come.
[time=2424] I would encourage you as you read the New Testament, if you ever read it out loud, that would be a good thing to do too.
[time=2431] To replace the word Christ with Messiah and it will give you a very different feeling as you read it.
[time=2437] And the last words here are verse one, the Son of God.
[time=2442] This is good news.
[time=2443] The Messiah is here.
[time=2444] And oh, by the way, he's the very Son of God.
[time=2446] As the Creed says, he's very God of very God.
[time=2450] So friends, I invite you to put all that on your table and say, I know, here's what I'm facing over here.
[time=2458] Here is this person who has appeared and he didn't stay a baby.
[time=2463] That's good news.
[time=2464] The swaddling clothes were eventually laid aside for a burial cloth.
[time=2473] That is good news of its own.
[time=2476] He has done for you what you could not do yourself.
[time=2481] I just didn't want to get past the magnitude of that verse.
[time=2484] It's good news.
[time=2485] He is the Messiah.
[time=2486] He's God's own Son and he's come.
[time=2489] And he's come.
[time=2490] And you need to agree with God about his son, Jesus.
[time=2493] And furthermore, agree with God about yourself.
[time=2496] That's really good news because you can do that.
[time=2498] Verse two, as it is written in Isaiah, the prophet, "Behold, I send my messenger
[time=2505] before your face who will prepare your way." The gospel has its beginning 700 years before Christ ever shows up.
[time=2514] That is God's perspective on the good news.
[time=2516] It has its beginnings in this person, Isaiah.
[time=2520] We'll spend a lot of time on Isaiah this week and next week laying out this picture of what the Bible says about the one who would come to save us.
[time=2528] The one who would come to save you.
[time=2535] Isaiah, the prophet, this is the circumstances surrounding what God has said.
[time=2543] Look at, back at Isaiah 40 with me.
[time=2545] This will be in the screens behind me.
[time=2546] Some of the verses that we read this week and next week won't be, but these will.
[time=2550] So I encourage you to write these down.
[time=2552] These are in your outline that this is Isaiah 40.
[time=2555] Isaiah is writing about 700 years before Christ is born.
[time=2558] And Isaiah is writing now to a people who are in exile, who have been taken away and who have been enslaved.
[time=2565] God has a great heart for those who are enslaved.
[time=2569] Those who are exploited with the people of Israel were in Babylon.
[time=2574] They are Babylonian in exile.
[time=2577] So when you partner with an organization like as their own, you are in that way,
[time=2583] friends, in harmony with God's very heart.
[time=2586] God has a heart for those who are far, who are struggling, who need the first two words of this chapter, Isaiah 40 verse 1, "Comforts, comfort my people," says your God.
[time=2598] Friends, you know, it's no good to give somebody comfort if it's false comfort.
[time=2604] If you should be, if you're struggling and there's really nothing you can do and saying, you know, comfort, comfort and nothing you can do about it, that feels a little bit fake.
[time=2614] So why should they be comforted?
[time=2616] Well, this is why.
[time=2617] Keep reading.
[time=2618] Verse 2, "Speak tenderly to Jerusalem.
[time=2622] Somebody who needs comfort should be spoken tenderly to." Right?
[time=2627] No harshness.
[time=2630] And cry to her that her warfare is ended.
[time=2633] That her iniquity, it's a word for sin.
[time=2635] It means like a blot, like a stain.
[time=2637] Her iniquity is pardoned.
[time=2639] That she has received from the Lord's hand double for all her sins.
[time=2644] I'm going to pause for a minute.
[time=2647] And I hope you can hear me when I say it.
[time=2649] I'm going to say it a couple times.
[time=2651] God's grace is greater than all your sin.
[time=2655] [AMEN] I hope you can hear me.
[time=2660] If you're from the sound of my voice, I'll say it to you again.
[time=2663] God's grace is greater than all your sin.
[time=2667] You have received from the Lord's hand double for all your sins.
[time=2671] He is disposed to act favorably towards you.
[time=2674] That's what that means.
[time=2676] Friends, I can't comfort you with anything greater than that this morning.
[time=2679] His grace is greater than all your sins.
[time=2683] You are not pulling a fast one on God.
[time=2685] He knows you right down to the ground.
[time=2689] And his grace is truly amazing.
[time=2692] That's how amazing it is.
[time=2694] Verse 3, "A voice cries in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord."
[time=2702] This is the context in the wilderness. Maybe yours says the desert.
[time=2706] "Make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
[time=2710] Every valley, verse 4, shall be lifted up.
[time=2713] Every mountain and hill be made low.
[time=2715] I can hear handles Messiah in my brain right now.
[time=2718] The uneven ground shall become level.
[time=2721] And the rough places a plane." I'll pause for a minute while you're looking at it.
[time=2725] Can we go back to verse 4 for a second?
[time=2727] Okay.
[time=2728] This is a verse that is all you ever have to know about the obstacles in your life.
[time=2737] What is God able to do?
[time=2740] Every valley shall be lifted up.
[time=2743] Every mountain laid low.
[time=2746] The uneven ground shall become level.
[time=2749] The rough places a plane.
[time=2750] This is the discipline that John would be seeking about making ready the way for Jesus.
[time=2756] If God says it will happen, friends, nothing will get in the way.
[time=2760] I'll repeat myself because you didn't respond.
[time=2763] If God says it will happen, then nothing is going to be able to get in the way.
[time=2768] So you can trust and rest in that.
[time=2770] But he is disposed. He is a good God.
[time=2773] And he loves his children.
[time=2775] I am a father limping around day by day trying to love and raise my kids.
[time=2782] And God is such an infinitely better father than I could ever hope or dream to be.
[time=2786] He knows how to give good gifts to his children.
[time=2790] And so if you are a child of God this morning, then he knows how to give good gifts to you.
[time=2794] And he will take care of you in the new year.
[time=2796] The new year is unwritten. It's a blank slate.
[time=2800] That can be a little bit scary, a little bit comforting all at the same time.
[time=2804] I offer you the comfort that God gives from his word today.
[time=2807] That whatever obstacles are in your way that might seem like, well, God can't do that.
[time=2812] He can remove them. He's able to do that. Nothing will be too difficult for him.
[time=2816] That is what was said in the Gospels around the birth of Jesus.
[time=2821] Mary is a virgin. That's not how it works.
[time=2824] That's not how babies come into the world.
[time=2827] Nothing will be difficult for God. Nothing will be impossible for God.
[time=2831] Do you believe that?
[time=2833] The glory of the Lord shall be revealed verse 5, and all flesh shall see it together.
[time=2839] The mouth of the Lord has spoken.
[time=2844] If God says it, you can take it to the bank. You can trust in it.
[time=2849] So back to Mark chapter 1 this morning, back to Mark 1.
[time=2854] This is the messenger. This is John. John has come preparing the way for Jesus.
[time=2858] Go to Luke 1 sometime this week. We won't go there this morning.
[time=2862] And read his father's words about him, about John.
[time=2866] Zechariah and his wife Elizabeth are very old and they can't have kids.
[time=2871] She's barren. And guess what? She's pregnant.
[time=2876] And Zechariah doesn't believe it for a minute.
[time=2878] And so he doesn't even speak for her whole pregnancy for over nine months.
[time=2882] And the first thing he says is this beautiful prayer in Luke chapter 1 about what his son John will go on to announce.
[time=2890] His son John will go on to announce that the sunrise for Monahai has come.
[time=2896] A good friend of mine, Jamie Curtis, is in Haiti working with kids there who are in danger.
[time=2905] And she tweeted a picture of some of the lines from him, "Oh holy night, thrill of hope."
[time=2912] A weary world rejoices. And it goes on to say, "For yonder breaks, new and glorious mourn." So whenever somebody announces, whenever we read that Christ has come, it's in agreement with Zechariah that he's the morning.
[time=2929] He's the dawn. He's the day spring. He's the promise.
[time=2934] It is as though, friends, everything before Christ was darkness and night time.
[time=2939] And everything after him is the light in day.
[time=2943] What a beautiful picture that is. What a beautiful encouragement that must be to you this morning.
[time=2949] Verse 3 says, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness.
[time=2953] Prepare the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight." That's Mark 1 verse 3. This is who Jesus really is.
[time=2961] If you haven't filled it out yet, go to your outline and fill in that first question in your bulletin.
[time=2966] The question was, "Who is Jesus?" Mark 1, 3 says, "He's the Lord."
[time=2972] Prepare the way of the Lord. Not just the Lord's messenger.
[time=2976] Not just one who's going to speak on God's behalf. That's what Isaiah did.
[time=2979] Isaiah was a prophet and prophets are really mouthpieces.
[time=2983] This is what God says. They speak on God's behalf.
[time=2986] This person goes far beyond that. Verse 1 of Mark makes that very clear.
[time=2992] He's God's own son. Again, very God of very God.
[time=2998] He's come to be with us, and that is good news.
[time=3002] Did you hear Psalm 121? The shade. He's right there at your right hand.
[time=3008] He's not far away. He's not distant.
[time=3011] I know it seems that way sometimes, but let me just bring information to your circumstances this morning and see that he is there. And he's close by.
[time=3020] As close as a prayer, God help me.
[time=3024] Can you pray that prayer? Sometimes. That's all you can maybe get out sometimes.
[time=3028] God help me. That's a prayer he hears.
[time=3033] And he's anxious to hear. Verse 4, John up here, John is a voice.
[time=3039] John is not like Jesus. In this way, John is loud and John eats bugs.
[time=3049] And John wears camel hair, and John lives in the desert.
[time=3054] So John is a guy you wouldn't mistake. Like you wouldn't just be like, "Oh yeah, how you doing? Whoa." And you see John like, "Oh my goodness, gracious." Leather belts and camel's hair and locusts, you know.
[time=3064] "Oh my." I think he dipped him in honey to make him taste better. I'm guessing.
[time=3067] I don't know why, but anyway, John was a guy that would get your attention.
[time=3071] Like he was a voice. He was abrasive.
[time=3076] You know that this is a spoiler alert on John the Baptist.
[time=3080] All John had to do to not be killed was to be quiet.
[time=3086] You know that he had things to say about Herod, and Herod had taken his brother's wife.
[time=3090] His brother's still alive, and John goes, "Not okay. Not okay, Herod.
[time=3095] Herod didn't like that. Herod's new wife. He didn't like that either.
[time=3098] But when I'm prison, it eventually killed. Just be quiet, John.
[time=3103] Just be quiet, and nothing would happen to you." And that John's blood cut out from the ground.
[time=3110] And Jesus came after him. Remarkable picture.
[time=3115] John appeared baptizing in the wilderness, verse 4, and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
[time=3122] And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him, and being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
[time=3131] Perhaps you're asking yourself, "Why are they doing this?" Let's look at Malachi chapter 4. This will not be on the screens behind me.
[time=3139] I don't think, but write that reference down in your bulletins.
[time=3143] As you're doing that, I'll tell you this. Malachi is the last book in what we call the Old Testament.
[time=3149] There are 39 books in the Old Testament, 27 in the New Testament.
[time=3153] Malachi is the very last book that we see in the English version of the Hebrew Old Testament.
[time=3160] Malachi was writing about 400 years before Christ was to come.
[time=3166] So Malachi is the last, thus says the Lord, prophet for 400 years until John shows up.
[time=3173] And this is the last thing, the last prophet in Israel says.
[time=3177] So hold that in your minds, right? Malachi is the last prophet.
[time=3180] This is the last thing that he says before 400 years where there was no voice from God in that way.
[time=3186] Here we go. Malachi 4 verse 1.
[time=3190] "For behold the day is coming, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evil doers will be stubble."
[time=3197] That's bad.
[time=3199] "The day that is coming shall set them ablaze, says the Lord of hosts, says Yahweh of armies, that it will leave them neither root nor branch.
[time=3207] But for you who fear my name, the son of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings.
[time=3214] You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall." Ask Brother Raber about that after his service.
[time=3220] Verse 3, "You shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I act, says the Lord of hosts, Yahweh of armies." Verse 4, "Remember the law of my servant Moses, the statutes and rules that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel.
[time=3239] Behold, verse 5, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes."
[time=3249] Well, here comes John.
[time=3251] He looks like Elijah.
[time=3253] 2 Kings 1, 8 describes Elijah's physical appearance just like John.
[time=3259] He sounds like Elijah.
[time=3261] He says the kind of things that Elijah would say.
[time=3263] He speaks prophetically.
[time=3264] He says hard things, hard, truthful things like Elijah would do.
[time=3268] "Remember to Ahab in the Old Testament." He's confrontational.
[time=3274] So people hear about this guy in the wilderness eating bugs wearing candles.
[time=3278] They're like, "Oh my goodness, it's happening." Malachi 4 is happening.
[time=3282] So what happens?
[time=3283] Verse 5, they all go out to see him.
[time=3285] They all confess their sins because they don't want to be the ones trampled on.
[time=3289] They want to be the ones trampling.
[time=3292] They want to be the trampolers, the trampolese, if you will.
[time=3296] So they're all going out to the wilderness to see John.
[time=3300] Getting baptized to demonstrate that they're sorry for their sins and they want to go a different way.
[time=3306] He's preparing the way for Jesus.
[time=3309] Verse 6, John must clothe the camel's hair and wear leather belts around his waist and eat locusts and wild honey.
[time=3315] Verse 7, we'll conclude with this, this morning.
[time=3321] He preached saying, "After me comes he who was mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie."
[time=3336] It's an amazing statement.
[time=3338] We walk you fewer for a minute.
[time=3340] In Luke 7, Jesus says about John the Baptist.
[time=3343] He says, "Among those born of women, there is nobody greater than John the Baptist.
[time=3349] Nobody." John now says of Jesus, "I am not even worthy to untie his shoes and wash his feet."
[time=3361] That's the picture here, the loneliest household slave.
[time=3367] Can you hold those things together?
[time=3370] No one in the world greater than John.
[time=3375] And John says, "I'm not even worthy to wash his feet."
[time=3381] How great is Jesus?
[time=3386] He is that great.
[time=3388] He is the mighty one who is coming.
[time=3392] He is the one who will baptize verse 8 with the Holy Spirit.
[time=3398] I can't wait to show you those things next week, I'm so excited about it.
[time=3401] This is who Jesus is, friends.
[time=3404] I invite you to agree with God's word on that front.
[time=3407] He is the mighty one who is coming.
[time=3415] He is the one that will give, make all things new.
[time=3419] In our series on the Holy Spirit, that's going to be a major part of what we talk about.
[time=3424] That the Holy Spirit is the guarantee that what has happened in a person's life really has taken place in Ephesians chapter 1.
[time=3430] Oh, I can't wait, I'm so excited about it.
[time=3433] This is who Jesus is.
[time=3434] To come back next week and hear part two of this, what am I to do?
[time=3437] A lot to say about those things.
[time=3439] Would you pray with me this morning?
[time=3449] Heavenly Father, it's good to call you that.
[time=3456] You're good Father.
[time=3459] You know how to give good gifts to your children.
[time=3465] Lord today, help us not merely to nod our heads at your word, but that our lives would be different.
[time=3474] Grace greater than all our sin, God isn't licensed to do whatever I want.
[time=3480] It's a demonstration of your love for us and an invitation for us to respond with a loving, gracious obedience.
[time=3489] To make me so, God, I just take a minute today and just thank you.
[time=3495] Thank you that your Son has come, that you are close to us, God.
[time=3499] Close to us today and every day.
[time=3503] And that we can be comforted by that this morning.
[time=3505] I pray for my dear sisters and brothers in the room this morning, God, that whatever is facing them in the coming days, that you would remind them what your word says in light of it.
[time=3515] And that you would give them your grace in increasing measure day by day.
[time=3521] Thank you for Black Hawk Ministries, God.
[time=3523] We trust you with the coming year, God.
[time=3525] We trust you with whatever is down the road.
[time=3527] You're already there.
[time=3528] You know.
[time=3529] We don't.
[time=3530] Help us.
[time=3531] Go before us.
[time=3532] I pray all those things in Jesus' name.
[time=3534] [AMEN]
