[time=503] - Well, good morning everyone and welcome to the Bible Hour
[time=510] and Happy New Year from us here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=512] First time I've seen you here in this new year, grateful that you're watching, grateful that you've begun your new year with us and we are gonna strive in 2015 like we strove last year to provide you with solid teaching from God's word with a dynamic encounter with God in our gathering.
[time=532] We pledge that to you this morning and we're grateful for all that God has in store.
[time=537] 2015 is gonna be a big year for Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=540] Lots of things on the horizon, lots of unknowns, but we confidently place the things that we don't know in God's strong and capable hands.
[time=550] And we invite you to pray for us as this year is out ahead of us, it's a blank slate.
[time=555] So we covet your prayers.
[time=557] We would ask you to pray for us as we seek God's will for how we should lead in our community, how we should lead ourselves.
[time=564] We just would ask you to join with us and pray, to earnestly pray and seek God in this coming year that the way that we do things and the way that we serve our community will be pleasing and honoring to Him that it would be in alignment with God's word.
[time=578] That's very much our desire and we invite you as part of our family to join us as we do that.
[time=583] This morning, we begin our series on the Holy Spirit.
[time=587] I'll be talking about the second half of a passage from Mark chapter one that you saw last week where Christ is baptized by John the Baptist and then the Holy Spirit descends on Jesus, that's very significant.
[time=600] And we'll talk about why that is in the role of the Holy Spirit, His ministry, His work, His person.
[time=606] We'll do it next five weeks and then leading into Easter.
[time=610] We'll talk about the last four days of Jesus' life in a very intense and a very specific way.
[time=616] We're delighted, again, that you're watching this morning and that's a lot to look forward to up the first third of the year.
[time=624] So please come and see us.
[time=626] Please drop us a line.
[time=627] Like I often ask you to drop us a line.
[time=629] Would you please do that in the new year?
[time=631] Would you resolve to be in communication with us in some way, to write us an email, to send us a note, to give us a call and to say that you're watching, to tell us what we can do better, to just let us know that you're there.
[time=644] That would be a great encouragement to us and we would just encourage you on that front.
[time=649] 2015, again, is a year filled with promise, filled with expectation, filled with things that we don't know.
[time=656] And so we can choose and we are choosing today to be hopeful.
[time=660] We're choosing to lay it out before the Lord and say, God, would you please go before us this year?
[time=665] We don't know what the future holds the saying says, but we know who holds the future.
[time=671] So we at Black Hawk, the team here at Black Hawk, we can confidently say that God is in this coming year and he knows the end from the beginning already.
[time=681] And we take great comfort from that.
[time=684] I can't wait for you to see what we're gonna talk about this morning.
[time=686] I can't wait for it to hear from you about how we're doing in this new year.
[time=689] What a better time for you to resolve with us in the new year to be in more communication.
[time=695] So thank you for watching.
[time=697] Before we sign off this morning, just wanted to say a quick word.
[time=701] Yesterday, we got to Barry, Mary Howell.
[time=705] Jay Howell and Joe Howell have been a long time members of our church.
[time=708] We got to Barry, Jay's mom yesterday and celebrate her life.
[time=712] Mary was a long time watcher of the Bible hour and the howls are dear friends, dear members of this church since the 1970s.
[time=722] So I wanted to publicly thank Mary.
[time=724] Mary had asked that donations be made to the Bible hour as a part of her service yesterday.
[time=729] So I wanted to publicly acknowledge Mary, wanted to say thank you to Jay and Jill for just honoring the Lord as you honored your mom yesterday.
[time=738] So like Mary Howell, dear friends, if you're a watcher of the Bible hour, thank you for watching.
[time=744] Thank you for your years and years of diligent and faithful involvement in this way.
[time=750] I wish you a blessed and a truly happy new year as God defines happiness and we'll see you soon.
[time=756] Thanks again.
[time=757] - Never once did Black Hawk ever walk by themselves
[time=765] and never again will Black Hawk walk by themselves
[time=771] because God is faithful and he'll always be with us.
[time=776] I love that and I love this song.
[time=777] Let's sing it together.
[time=781] [MUSIC - 194 seconds]
[time=980] Father, God, we praise you because you are faithful.
[time=986] And I praise you because I'm never walking alone.
[time=990] I'm never walking this earth alone.
[time=994] I pray for hearts in this room.
[time=996] I pray that you protect our hearts.
[time=1000] I pray, Father, that you continue to protect this church.
[time=1006] I pray, Father, that we become a church of worship,
[time=1012] a church of prayer.
[time=1014] I pray that you're pleased with what happens today
[time=1020] and in the weeks to come at Black Hawk.
[time=1025] Thank you again for loving us, like you do, and like no other.
[time=1030] [AMEN] [MUSIC - 225 seconds]
[time=1261] - I'm glad that you're here this morning.
[time=1272] We're gonna pick up where we left off last week as we kick off our series on the Holy Spirit.
[time=1277] We've been telling our series on the Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit.
[time=1281] There's no confusion about that, what we're talking about.
[time=1283] If you have your Bibles, would you go to Mark chapter one today, it's good to see all of you together.
[time=1290] This is gonna be fun, looking forward to this.
[time=1294] Mark chapter one, can we read starting in verse eight
[time=1300] of Mark chapter one, and we're gonna read all the way down through verse 15.
[time=1305] So we're gonna talk about several things at once today.
[time=1307] So hang in there with me, if you would.
[time=1309] I get one shot at it today.
[time=1311] So we'll see how it goes.
[time=1314] Mark chapter one, verse eight.
[time=1315] This is John the Baptist speaking,
[time=1321] and the pronoun he in verse eight is Jesus, just to keep the record straight.
[time=1326] I, he said, have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
[time=1333] Verse nine.
[time=1334] In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
[time=1343] When he had come up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the spirit descending on him like a dove.
[time=1352] And a voice came from heaven.
[time=1354] You are my beloved son.
[time=1357] With you, I am well pleased.
[time=1359] The spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.
[time=1364] And he was in the wilderness 40 days, being tempted by Satan, and he was with the wild animals and the angels were ministering to him.
[time=1374] Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God and saying, the time is fulfilled.
[time=1384] The kingdom of God is at hand, repent, and believe in the gospel.
[time=1391] This is God's word.
[time=1392] We will, we, last week were in the first part of this passage.
[time=1396] We ended up at verse seven.
[time=1398] And I just wanted to revisit this this morning 'cause I'm thinking about it for weeks.
[time=1403] Longer than that.
[time=1404] I mentioned it to you before, but I can't get over it.
[time=1407] Mark one, verse seven.
[time=1409] John the Baptist says that there's someone coming after him of whom he is not even worthy to untie this person's shoes.
[time=1417] And elsewhere in the gospels, Jesus says that there's nobody among women greater than John the Baptist.
[time=1425] So there's a very subtle statement in there.
[time=1427] If you can put those two things together, that John says I can't even untie his shoes to wash his feet, to serve him in that way.
[time=1434] And Jesus says he is no one among women born greater than John.
[time=1439] How, from last week, how great is Jesus?
[time=1444] He is surpassingly great.
[time=1446] That's a statement sort of tucked away in that verse.
[time=1450] I didn't wanna start to say without recycling back to that.
[time=1454] What a beautiful thing.
[time=1455] I am not worthy to stoop down, verse seven and untie his sandals, my goodness.
[time=1461] There's this wonderful principle about John.
[time=1464] I don't know if you resolve in the new year.
[time=1467] I don't know if you are a resolver.
[time=1469] I hope that you are always.
[time=1472] Do a word search, by the way, in the scriptures on new.
[time=1475] If you're looking for something to do this week, just go to Bible gateway or to a website and do a search on the word new.
[time=1481] And it's a good pop of everywhere.
[time=1482] New moons and new covenants and everywhere.
[time=1486] I think you'll be encouraged by it.
[time=1488] John has this way of living his life.
[time=1493] He says he must increase, this is in John chapter three.
[time=1496] He must increase, remember this?
[time=1498] But I must decrease.
[time=1500] I don't know if you are a person, again, that makes resolutions in the new year, but I would invite you to consider that one.
[time=1508] To take John the Baptist's posture and say, I want people in me to look at my life as this t-shirt with a finger pointing out, I'm with him.
[time=1517] That's what John's life is like.
[time=1519] I'm with Jesus.
[time=1520] I want you to know nothing else about me, but to know that I'm with Jesus.
[time=1523] And the way I treat people is gonna reflect that.
[time=1526] So there is a vertical nature of that.
[time=1528] I have this relationship with God, but that's going to affect the way I treat you, shouldn't it?
[time=1533] I think it should.
[time=1535] He must increase.
[time=1536] I must decrease.
[time=1538] Look at verse eight with me if you would please.
[time=1542] This is John framing the ministry of Jesus.
[time=1545] Mark chapter one, verse eight.
[time=1547] I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
[time=1552] If I would invite you to underline his name, the Holy Spirit in your Bibles.
[time=1557] I was talking with my friend Steve Longbrake this morning.
[time=1560] And we noticed together that the Holy Spirit is everywhere in the scriptures, the Holy Spirit.
[time=1565] But he has this, it's very specific.
[time=1568] So his agency, what he's gonna come to do is very specific.
[time=1572] Look at Isaiah 44 starting with verse one.
[time=1574] This will be on the screens behind me in front of you.
[time=1578] And think about that.
[time=1579] John says, I will, I baptize you with water.
[time=1581] And let me pause before I go to Isaiah 44 and say this to you.
[time=1586] We, this church believes in the right of baptism because we like to align with the scriptures.
[time=1593] The scriptures say, there are no unbaptized believers in the New Testament.
[time=1597] So Jesus comes to John to be baptized.
[time=1601] And friends, I think he comes as an example to us.
[time=1604] And I invite you to do what I invited you to do a few weeks ago up behind where the cross now is.
[time=1609] To consider if you haven't been baptized, would you consider it in this new year?
[time=1614] Not because your salvation will go into overdrive or because you got some kind of spiritual power in the waters, but because it's an active obedience.
[time=1621] And this church can benefit from hearing what God has done in your life.
[time=1624] He has done amazing things.
[time=1627] Many of you have told me, you sat in a room and told me what God has done.
[time=1632] I'm so glad that you did that.
[time=1633] But don't be shy about telling what God has done.
[time=1637] Let us hear it from you.
[time=1639] So would you come talk to us after the service?
[time=1641] Will we be down here in front, elders down here in front?
[time=1642] I'll be down here.
[time=1643] Come talk about being baptized.
[time=1644] There's a process that we can work you through.
[time=1646] I'm so grateful for that.
[time=1648] Jesus was baptized.
[time=1650] Follow his example.
[time=1651] Not because he needed to be forgiven or because he needed anything to happen, but to identify with you.
[time=1656] That's why he was baptized.
[time=1657] Anyway, Isaiah 44.
[time=1659] These verses rang in my ears as I read Mark 1 8 this week.
[time=1665] Isaiah 44, "But now here O Jacob, my servants, Israel, "whom I have chosen, thus says the Lord who made you." If you are there in your Bibles, if you're in Isaiah 44, would you underline that statement that begins verse two?
[time=1680] Thus says the Lord.
[time=1682] This is what God says.
[time=1685] We believe in this place, that's what the Bible is.
[time=1687] It's God speaking to us.
[time=1690] His very word, revealing himself.
[time=1693] So I should pay attention.
[time=1694] This is what God says.
[time=1696] Who made you, who formed you from the womb and will help you.
[time=1702] Do you believe that?
[time=1704] [AMEN] That will change your life.
[time=1709] If you believe that God formed you in the womb and beyond that, that he will help you.
[time=1715] That will affect the way you live your life.
[time=1717] Fear not, O Jacob, my servant, Jesherin whom I have chosen.
[time=1721] Verse three, Isaiah 44.
[time=1723] Four, because is that word four.
[time=1726] Because I will pour water on the thirsty land.
[time=1730] Streams on the dry ground.
[time=1733] Streams in the desert.
[time=1735] I will pour my spirit upon your offspring and my blessing on your descendant.
[time=1741] That was a promise from God 700 years before Christ ever showed up.
[time=1748] I submit to you friends that Mark one is the beginning of the fulfillment of that promise.
[time=1753] I will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
[time=1755] John promises that Christ will usher that in.
[time=1760] And then you flip over a few pages to Acts chapter one and there it is.
[time=1763] On Pentecost, the Holy Spirit unleashed on those that align themselves with Jesus.
[time=1769] What a beautiful thing that is.
[time=1770] The Bible friends is, I'll write this down if you would in your bulletin.
[time=1774] There's some notes in there.
[time=1775] The Bible is one story.
[time=1777] It's not a collection of a whole bunch of ones.
[time=1779] It's one story from beginning to end.
[time=1781] I hope this week today in the next few minutes to just show you that, just to gather the way.
[time=1786] And so the Bible is telling one story from beginning to end.
[time=1790] It's a love story that God loves his people.
[time=1793] He loves them so much that his son came.
[time=1796] I was talking again with Steve this morning about this truth.
[time=1799] The Christmas enshrines.
[time=1802] We still have our tree up at our house.
[time=1805] Maybe you do too.
[time=1806] It'll be up for a few more days.
[time=1808] They're up there in the lobby.
[time=1809] So I feel like we got some coverage there.
[time=1811] We're good, we're not the only ones, okay?
[time=1813] I think what Christmas can mean for you this year is to never forget that what that love, how much love his coming represents.
[time=1823] That he laid aside his majesty to become one of us.
[time=1829] I invite you to be overwhelmed by that day by day.
[time=1833] Maybe you're not a singer.
[time=1834] Maybe you come into a room like this and there's screens and there's a band here and you're singing and if that's strange for you, I know, I understand.
[time=1841] We sing for that reason because that's what we believe Jesus is.
[time=1844] That's who we believe he is.
[time=1846] Worthy of praise, God with us.
[time=1850] I invite you to consider that this year.
[time=1852] Why do I sing these songs?
[time=1853] Why would I give him praise?
[time=1855] That's why, because he loves us that much.
[time=1860] God loved the world so much he gave his only son.
[time=1864] I only have one.
[time=1865] I have one son.
[time=1867] I told you before, I don't know what I would give him up for, but it would be something pretty special.
[time=1872] How does God feel about you?
[time=1874] You never need to doubt it.
[time=1876] I formed you from the womb and I will help you.
[time=1879] He will help you.
[time=1880] People will let you down.
[time=1883] I will let you down.
[time=1884] I've been around here long enough to disappoint a lot of people.
[time=1887] That's just a couple of weeks in the scene.
[time=1889] I've been around for years.
[time=1891] And so there are a lot of you in this room that I had disappointed personally and I'm sorry about that.
[time=1896] I'm sorry if that's gotten in the way of the way that you respond rightly to God.
[time=1899] I truly am.
[time=1899] But Isaiah 44 verse two will never be under threat because of me.
[time=1905] He will help you.
[time=1907] That's a promise.
[time=1909] And he knows your circumstance better than I do, better than any of us do.
[time=1914] And you can trust him in this new year.
[time=1917] Verse nine, Mark chapter one.
[time=1919] In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee
[time=1925] and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
[time=1928] If you go back up to this chapter, looking at verse five, there's a very interesting phrase at the end of verse five in Mark one.
[time=1936] It says that the people came to be baptized by John from last week that people were freaking out because they saw John coming.
[time=1942] Sounds like Elijah.
[time=1943] It looks like Elijah.
[time=1945] Judgment's coming.
[time=1946] Oh man.
[time=1946] They came to the wilderness.
[time=1947] They were all freaking out because there was gonna be this burning fire coming.
[time=1952] They wanted to not be burned up.
[time=1954] They came to John to be baptized confessing their sins.
[time=1957] You see that at the end of verse five?
[time=1959] Please notice in verse nine, he comes to be baptized but doesn't come confessing his sins.
[time=1966] Why?
[time=1968] Because there are no sins to confess.
[time=1971] He comes to be baptized friends to identify with you, with people that need forgiveness but he doesn't need it himself.
[time=1979] This is why his sacrifice is perfect.
[time=1983] This is why his death on your behalf is the all sufficient sacrifice for your sins and why you can't perform to a level that will merit that forgiveness because he already did.
[time=1997] No sins to confess.
[time=2000] His sacrifice on your behalf is enough.
[time=2002] It was enough last year.
[time=2003] It's enough this year.
[time=2005] And I encourage you with that today.
[time=2007] He came from Nazareth of Galilee.
[time=2011] It's a real place.
[time=2013] Everywhere the Bible assumes it's talking to real people on the Bible's myths and the Bible's fairy tales and the galaxy far, far away and once upon a time.
[time=2022] And that's fine if you believe that.
[time=2025] I can, people believe those things but what does the evidence suggest?
[time=2030] The Bible doesn't believe itself to be telling a myth or a fairy tale.
[time=2034] It assumes a real place.
[time=2035] You can go visit Nazareth in Galilee.
[time=2038] It's a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful place.
[time=2041] A real place.
[time=2042] I've been to Galilee.
[time=2043] Anybody in the room, raise your hands.
[time=2044] You've been there.
[time=2046] I see some hands.
[time=2047] It's a real place, isn't it, Gary?
[time=2049] You can put your feet on the shores of the Sea of Galilee.
[time=2053] It's a real place.
[time=2054] Everywhere the Bible assumes it's talking to real people living in space and time.
[time=2058] People like you.
[time=2059] So God will help you.
[time=2062] That sounds nice.
[time=2064] The same God that shows up in your life and the lives of real people is still showing up in the lives of real people.
[time=2071] People like you.
[time=2072] Well, you don't know what I've done, Steve.
[time=2075] You're right, I don't.
[time=2077] I don't need to.
[time=2078] He knows the end from the beginning.
[time=2080] He knows everything about you.
[time=2082] He is even better, forgive me, even better than Santa Claus.
[time=2086] He knows everything about you.
[time=2088] Even in January, he knows everything about you.
[time=2090] Is that okay to say that?
[time=2092] Okay, good.
[time=2093] Verse 10, no sins to confess.
[time=2099] No sins to confess.
[time=2101] There are two points in your outline.
[time=2102] I think you had the same one from last week 'cause I didn't finish last week.
[time=2105] And number one in our outline, if you were here last week is who's Jesus?
[time=2110] The gospel of Mark begins with verse one says he's the Son of God.
[time=2114] And he is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.
[time=2120] He's the person we're talking about these next five weeks.
[time=2122] So we're gonna keep spelling this out.
[time=2126] But don't miss Isaiah 44.
[time=2128] That reference is not in your notes.
[time=2129] Write that reference down.
[time=2130] Isaiah 44, right out of verse eight.
[time=2134] It's very, very important.
[time=2135] But wait, there's more.
[time=2138] Verse 10, by the way, when you're reading narrative and the Bible and narrative is in the Lord for a story, pay close attention to pronouns.
[time=2147] When he came up with the water, that's referring back to Jesus.
[time=2152] So just pay attention to, it can get lost if you don't pay attention to it.
[time=2154] The NASB capitalizes the pronouns about Jesus.
[time=2157] And I love it that it does that 'cause it helps helpful in that way.
[time=2160] Verse 10, and when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the spirit descending on him like a dove.
[time=2172] Wow, I thought about Isaiah 64.
[time=2177] That's gonna be in the screens in front of you as well.
[time=2180] All these verses, all these things that Mark is writing about, he's writing them as echoes of all things Isaiah the prophet said.
[time=2187] That's why he begins his gospel with those words as it's written to Isaiah.
[time=2192] Listen to Isaiah 64.
[time=2193] The first word there in my translation is the word O.
[time=2199] And I invite you to hear that, read that word with me to yourself.
[time=2204] Like the prophet was, oh, that you'd run the heavens and come down.
[time=2207] I wish you would, it's that kind of an O.
[time=2209] Oh, I wish you would run the heavens and come down that the mountains might quake at your presence when fire kindles brush wood and the fire causes water to boil to make your name known.
[time=2224] If you're gonna mark in your Bibles, if you're open to that physical passage, I hope that you are.
[time=2229] Underline those words, please friends, to make your name known, goes back to what Rick said a few minutes ago.
[time=2235] That's why he does these things, to make his name known, to your adversaries.
[time=2240] But the nations might tremble at your presence.
[time=2243] Verse three, you'll see a theme here.
[time=2246] When you did awesome things that we did not look for, you came down.
[time=2253] The mountains quaked at your presence from of old.
[time=2257] No one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, a God who acts for those who wait for him, who acts for those who wait for him.
[time=2272] My friends in the coming weeks will spell this out in much greater detail.
[time=2278] But if you walk out of here this morning with nothing else, walk out of here with this.
[time=2282] We sang a song before I came up, holy, holy, holy, we sang with the saints for years.
[time=2286] It's a dearly beloved hymnit should be.
[time=2288] And that hymn enshrines this truth, that the Bible says there's one God who shows himself to us in three persons.
[time=2296] That is a mystery.
[time=2297] I invite you this morning to reject an egg analogy.
[time=2301] God's like an egg, the shell, the yoke.
[time=2304] No, it's not, God's not an egg.
[time=2307] And God's not water either, can be frozen, can be a liquid, can be a gas, no.
[time=2311] God's not water either.
[time=2313] That may be a way into the conversation, but that's not what it is.
[time=2316] It's a mystery.
[time=2317] How can one God show up in three persons?
[time=2320] I don't know, but it's there.
[time=2322] The Bible everywhere declares there is one God in three persons.
[time=2327] And the person of the Holy Spirit is promised to be your comforter, to be one who comes alongside you, to bear witness of Jesus.
[time=2335] Remember that.
[time=2338] The Holy Spirit is the one who illumines what we call the Bible.
[time=2343] That's why it's God's word.
[time=2344] He inspired, that's where that word comes from.
[time=2346] He inspired, he breathes it out.
[time=2349] He worked with these people to write down what we call the Bible.
[time=2352] So when you read Isaiah 64, it says that he will help you.
[time=2355] The Spirit comes right alongside you as a comforter to say, yes, I will be with you.
[time=2360] And I will help you.
[time=2362] He will be a friend close to you.
[time=2364] Psalm 121, the Lord is your shade at your right hand.
[time=2367] That's what that means.
[time=2369] He's present and with you every single day.
[time=2372] People in the Bible, friends in the Old Testament did not have that promise.
[time=2376] The Holy Spirit came and he went and he came and he went like in judges, like in Samson.
[time=2381] The Spirit rushes on him and the Spirit goes away.
[time=2384] Not so today, not so today.
[time=2387] Ephesians one says the Holy Spirit is the down payment.
[time=2389] He's the guarantee of your future inheritance.
[time=2392] The one that Mary Howl is enjoying this morning.
[time=2395] [AMEN] That's why we'll talk about the Holy Spirit.
[time=2401] That's why it's worth our time.
[time=2402] That's why we treasured this book.
[time=2406] It's God's Word.
[time=2407] Are you resolved in this year to spend time in here?
[time=2410] If it's a series of rules for you to follow merely, then it will be a little bit, it's like doing set ups.
[time=2416] I know I should, but you know, if the Bible is God disclosing himself to you, that God's showing himself to you, that's what it's about, then of course you would do what he says because you love him.
[time=2429] So I invite you to see it that way as well.
[time=2432] In this new year, remember that God tore open the heavens at the baptism of Jesus and came down.
[time=2439] He came down in the person of the Holy Spirit to the person of Jesus.
[time=2446] And how did he come down?
[time=2447] What does it say?
[time=2450] Like a dove.
[time=2451] What does that mean, Steve?
[time=2453] I'm glad you asked.
[time=2453] Didn't come down like an eagle.
[time=2457] No very majestic.
[time=2459] Not like a hawk, no very fierce.
[time=2462] Not like a cardinal, very pretty.
[time=2466] Like stroting around like a cardinal or rooster.
[time=2469] Rooster would come down, bad analogy.
[time=2470] Anyway, like a dove, it comes down like a dove.
[time=2473] What does that mean?
[time=2474] It comes down in gentleness.
[time=2477] In meekness, this is the spirit that he was endowed with, it is baptism.
[time=2483] The same one who lives in you, gentleness, not majesty, not fierceness, not ostentation, showiness, gentleness.
[time=2493] Look at Isaiah 42 with me, Isaiah 42.
[time=2497] This is what I think is going on here.
[time=2500] Again, the Holy Spirit is our lens.
[time=2503] So watch.
[time=2504] Oh, watch.
[time=2506] There is no daylight between Christ and the Holy Spirit.
[time=2509] No daylight.
[time=2510] That's exactly what the Testament says about the Holy Spirit, that he will bear witness of Jesus.
[time=2517] So I invite you, in fact, I beg you to reject anything on the Holy Spirit doesn't make much of Jesus.
[time=2525] It's not of him, otherwise.
[time=2527] That's a test of the spirits.
[time=2528] Does this spirit make much of Jesus?
[time=2530] Yes, pay attention.
[time=2532] Does it not?
[time=2533] Don't.
[time=2535] I beg you as a friend, not to do that.
[time=2536] Look at Isaiah 42, behold my servant.
[time=2540] This is the language.
[time=2541] This is my son and well-pleased, right?
[time=2543] Whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights.
[time=2548] Pause for a minute.
[time=2550] I've always marveled at Mark chapter one that Jesus, this is the very, very beginning of Jesus' ministry.
[time=2559] He hasn't done anything yet.
[time=2562] So what has he done for God to praise?
[time=2565] Nothing.
[time=2566] He's just his son and he loves him.
[time=2570] This is unqualified approval.
[time=2574] Now, when you say, when you align yourself with Jesus and he calls you an heir, that's what he calls you, it's exactly how God feels about you.
[time=2583] I hope you heard me.
[time=2585] You don't have to do anything for God to declare his love for you.
[time=2590] He has done it in the person of his son.
[time=2592] You align yourself with him?
[time=2594] That's you.
[time=2595] You are co-air.
[time=2597] All that he has is all that you have.
[time=2600] [AMEN] Oh, how wonderful is that?
[time=2602] That is a wonderful thing to contemplate today.
[time=2606] My chosen, in whom my soul delights, I have put my spirit upon him.
[time=2612] He will bring forth justice to the nations.
[time=2618] I just merciful and mighty, that is the God that we serve.
[time=2622] He will not cry aloud, lift up his voice.
[time=2625] He won't be like John.
[time=2626] Now John had his pistols out.
[time=2630] He's ready to go, not this guy.
[time=2632] Make it hurt in the street.
[time=2633] A bruised read, he will not break.
[time=2636] Reads are bent over and very fragile.
[time=2642] Bruised in that way, you won't break them.
[time=2644] A faintly burning wick, he won't quench.
[time=2647] He will faithfully bring forth justice.
[time=2650] He will not grow faint or be discouraged until he has established justice in the earth and the coastlands wait for his law.
[time=2660] Justice on the earth.
[time=2661] He's gonna bring it about, but not in this way.
[time=2665] There was a song we used to sing around Christmas time
[time=2671] at our church growing up and it said, how should a king come?
[time=2674] It's a simple song, Google it when you get home today.
[time=2678] Should he come with white horses and armies and that's what they thought he was gonna happen.
[time=2687] That's what they expected.
[time=2688] That's not what they got.
[time=2691] They got a manger in and out of the way place.
[time=2695] Remember what Nathaniel said?
[time=2696] Can anything good come out of Nazareth?
[time=2698] Like really?
[time=2700] Anything good come out of Fort Wayne?
[time=2701] What's Fort Wayne?
[time=2702] Who cares?
[time=2703] Yes, that's the point.
[time=2707] Not from Jerusalem, not with armies, not with horses, not with any of those things.
[time=2713] He never wrote a book, Jesus.
[time=2716] Never let an army, never held public office.
[time=2718] The most influential person in the history of the world.
[time=2723] So if you have a biblical picture of Jesus, if a biblical picture of greatness, and so this year if you aspire to be great, good, I encourage you in that way.
[time=2737] The Bible does too.
[time=2739] Whatever your hand finds to do, please agree with God about his son, Jesus.
[time=2743] He did not, the spirit comes not as a, not in power, but in in gentleness, like a dove.
[time=2752] A couple of years ago, I talked to you around Christmas time about the sacrifice that Mary and Joseph brought after Christ was born, the after him is their firstborn son, and they brought a sacrifice of two turtle does.
[time=2764] You know why?
[time=2766] Because they couldn't afford a lamb.
[time=2769] The law says if you can't afford a lamb, that's what you bring, and they did.
[time=2775] They brought the lamb with them in the person of Jesus.
[time=2780] To this imagery of gentleness and of not showingness,
[time=2786] but of simplicity and humility and meekness is there in the person of Christ.
[time=2791] That verse from Isaiah, did you hear that verse?
[time=2795] Making his name known to his adversaries, verse two of Isaiah 64.
[time=2801] Are you content this year to let the adversaries of God be his adversaries and too bad for you?
[time=2808] 'Cause he's not.
[time=2813] In the new year, remember that God did that.
[time=2816] Know that he did this to make his name known to his adversaries.
[time=2821] Don't be comfortable they should remain God's adversaries 'cause they can be changed, like you were changed.
[time=2825] A whole new nature.
[time=2826] Be confident that God has done and is doing and will do awesome things, awesome things.
[time=2834] That's the word awesome is tragically overused.
[time=2837] You've heard that before.
[time=2839] Pete's is awesome, Andrew Luck is awesome, you know?
[time=2844] Maybe, maybe not, I don't know.
[time=2847] Awesome, make your mouth fall open like awesome things.
[time=2854] God's doing them.
[time=2856] If you have eyes to see, be comforted that God acts for those that wait for him.
[time=2863] He will be patient, be patient.
[time=2870] Verse 11, a voice came from heaven.
[time=2873] You are my beloved son.
[time=2877] With you, I am well pleased.
[time=2878] All three members of the Trinity are involved.
[time=2883] The voice of the Father to the Son, the Spirit descends.
[time=2886] You cannot make sense of the Bible without believing in one God in three persons.
[time=2892] One God in three persons from before time began.
[time=2896] Why did God make the world?
[time=2899] Because he needed things?
[time=2900] No, because in this unbelievable community that God lived in, Father, Son, Holy Spirit, from before the dawn of creation, he creates out of the outflow of his love, of his expression of complete fullness and wants to invite you in.
[time=2916] That's how great God is.
[time=2918] He didn't need you to complete his creation, or, well, I'm so glad God you made me.
[time=2922] You know, you're yourself a favor, God, for making me.
[time=2925] No, no, no, no.
[time=2927] God made you to invite you into this perfect community he's lived in for all eternity, from before there was time.
[time=2934] You know the word university comes in?
[time=2938] University means unity, it's mashed together.
[time=2941] Unity and diversity.
[time=2942] So college has always been about trying to find the thing that ties it all together.
[time=2948] What's the thing that brings unity and diversity?
[time=2950] And we had this marvelous example in the very person of God from before time began.
[time=2955] One God in three persons.
[time=2957] Marvelous, the father isn't the son, the son isn't the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit isn't the father.
[time=2962] They're separate persons, one God.
[time=2964] Their natures aren't co-mingled, it's a beautiful thing.
[time=2969] You can ask Rick about that, but he's got the heavy lifting.
[time=2971] Rick Grabber can give you the heavy lifting on that and the Holy Spirit today.
[time=2973] Verse 11, "You are my beloved son with you, I am well pleased."
[time=2979] Why?
[time=2980] 'Cause he's a son, parents of children.
[time=2988] Hear me for a minute, indulge me.
[time=2990] Please, please do not imply or state to your kids
[time=2996] that your love for them is in any way conditional.
[time=3000] Do not.
[time=3004] If you get good grades, if you make the team, if you brush your teeth, I'll love you, don't.
[time=3012] I beg you not to do that.
[time=3013] Has very serious consequences.
[time=3016] Why do I love my children?
[time=3017] 'Cause they're my kids.
[time=3019] Am I happy when they perform?
[time=3022] Of course I am.
[time=3023] Do I love them more?
[time=3025] No, I don't tell them that, guys.
[time=3029] Day by day, day by day.
[time=3031] Verse 12 here is a bit of a left turn.
[time=3036] The Bible, again, will mess with you if you read it.
[time=3040] Yeah, yeah, yeah, what?
[time=3042] What's that?
[time=3043] Verse 12 is a good example.
[time=3044] The spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.
[time=3049] What?
[time=3052] This is the dilly love son.
[time=3053] God's very pleased.
[time=3054] Why would he do that to him?
[time=3056] It's a bit of a mystery.
[time=3057] There's more going on here than you might think.
[time=3062] John chapter three, verse eight says this.
[time=3065] The wind blows where it wishes and you hear it sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes.
[time=3070] So it is with everyone who was born of the spirit.
[time=3074] The Holy Spirit is, his working is oftentimes a mystery.
[time=3079] Not a secret, but his working is mysterious.
[time=3083] Christ seems to imply that in talking to Nicodemus and John chapter three, he's like, the spirit is like, he just happens ways you don't expect.
[time=3091] Happens in ways that are a bit, again, mysterious.
[time=3094] The spirit drives him out into the desert.
[time=3097] Jesus acts in obedience.
[time=3102] He goes.
[time=3103] He knew what was coming in the wilderness.
[time=3105] He wasn't like, what's going to happen out here?
[time=3107] Desert, vacation, what's happening?
[time=3111] Who knows?
[time=3112] He knew.
[time=3113] He acts in obedience to the spirit in the light of the Father's astonishing pronouncement about him.
[time=3120] He still acts in obedience.
[time=3122] That's a bit of a mystery too.
[time=3124] The spirit directs Jesus.
[time=3126] The spirit only bear witness of Jesus.
[time=3128] It's a remarkable thing they have going on.
[time=3131] Look at verse 13 here.
[time=3133] This is, Mark says very little about this.
[time=3136] Very little about the temptation.
[time=3138] Other gospels say a lot more, but here's what he says.
[time=3141] He was in the wilderness 40 days being tempted by Satan.
[time=3145] He was with the wild animals and the angels were ministering to him.
[time=3151] This is an extraordinary ordeal.
[time=3154] Extraordinary ordeal.
[time=3155] He remains faithful.
[time=3156] Verse 14, in conclusion today.
[time=3163] After John was arrested, I hinted at that last week that all John had to do was just be quiet.
[time=3171] But he kept messing with Herod.
[time=3173] Messing, messing, messing, messing, telling truth.
[time=3175] The word prophet in the scriptures, you heard that word before.
[time=3179] You hear the word prophet you think telling the future.
[time=3182] And it often is that, but a prophet is John the Baptist.
[time=3185] A prophet is someone that speaks truth to power.
[time=3188] And John is a great example of that.
[time=3191] It was uncomfortable for him to say, yeah, you shouldn't have your brother's wife.
[time=3195] And Herod's wife didn't like that very much as you might imagine.
[time=3199] Has him arrested, thrown into prison, and eventually killed.
[time=3202] John's off the scene.
[time=3205] John understands he must increase, I must decrease.
[time=3209] He knew what his job was.
[time=3210] He knew what his role was in the kingdom.
[time=3213] He had his expectation, his eyes set in the right place.
[time=3219] Remember what he says?
[time=3221] Behold the Lamb of God, takes away the sin of the world.
[time=3224] That's John's perspective.
[time=3228] I beg you in this new year, friends, to agree with the Bible about Jesus.
[time=3234] And the Holy Spirit's working in our lives is never more clear than when you do agree with the word that he inspired about the person of Jesus Christ, the Messiah.
[time=3246] That's the way you can honor him in the new year.
[time=3250] In your notes, there are two things.
[time=3252] There's two notes.
[time=3254] The first one was who's Jesus.
[time=3255] I think that's really important.
[time=3256] Verse 11, he's the beloved son.
[time=3258] He's very God of very God.
[time=3260] The second is this, what should I do?
[time=3265] Verse 14, I invite you to do what Jesus tells you to do.
[time=3271] After John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God and saying, the time is fulfilled.
[time=3282] The kingdom of God is at hand, repent and believe in the gospel.
[time=3289] In Matthew chapter three, in verse eight, he is talking to the Pharisees and Sadducees and it says, you snakes, you snakes.
[time=3301] He wasn't, he was a gentle spirit, but man, he came out with the right hook sometimes with these guys.
[time=3309] He was very gentle with sinners, but not gentle with those that were religious and had all their act together, so to speak.
[time=3316] He was swinging with those people.
[time=3318] He says, bear fruits in keeping with repentance in Matthew three, verse eight.
[time=3322] That's what you should do.
[time=3326] Repent and believe in the gospel.
[time=3328] That is the action to take away for today.
[time=3335] Repent, you know, means to turn.
[time=3337] To turn from this to something else, something way better.
[time=3341] Isn't just repent, okay, repent, okay, good, repent.
[time=3345] Repent and what?
[time=3345] Repent and believe in the good news.
[time=3348] What good news that God in the person of his son loves you with an everlasting love more than you could ever possibly comprehend?
[time=3357] You don't have to perform to please him.
[time=3360] You have to agree with God about yourself and Jesus and you'll be saved.
[time=3364] That's good news.
[time=3367] The gospel is not a gospel of performance.
[time=3371] The true gospel, it's a gospel of grace.
[time=3375] I wanna read that quote in your bulletin as we wind up today and then we'll pray together.
[time=3383] It's a quote from FF Bruce, the second one in the list.
[time=3386] This seems a good wrap up.
[time=3391] What should you do?
[time=3393] Watch, Christ is God's complete word to men.
[time=3398] He has nothing to say which has not been said in Christ.
[time=3405] The word which became incarnate, he took on flesh in Jesus Christ, has been recorded for us in the holy writ, holy writings.
[time=3415] The spirit of God who spoke by the prophets and apostles
[time=3421] still speaks to us through their words and thus bears witness to Christ the perfect revelation of God.
[time=3430] New Year's resolutions can often be very tedious and we break them by February 1st and on with our lives.
[time=3440] My encouragement to you by the spirit of God is to resolve in this new year to turn from things that will not, that which is not life as the Bible says.
[time=3450] Repent and believe in the good news and allow your heart and mind to be shaped in that way.
[time=3458] We're gonna pray together and have a couple of announcements as we close this morning and the elders will be down here in front to pray with you if you'd like that in New Year.
[time=3465] Please come let us know how we can serve you in that way.
[time=3469] This morning I submit to you folks that who Jesus is and what you should do are very, very important whatever time of the year it happens to be.
[time=3478] Would you pray with me?
[time=3480] (breathing) Heavenly Father, I thank you for your son Jesus.
[time=3489] I thank you for your Holy Spirit, the one who comes alongside to bear witness of Him, to whisper the truth to us God in that still small voice.
[time=3503] I pray God for my friends in this room that they would agree with you about your son Jesus, that they would listen to the Holy Spirit's voice about your son and God whatever repentance is necessary in my life in our lives may it be so in this New Year.
[time=3519] May we agree with you about ourselves, agree with you about Jesus.
[time=3526] God let that shape the course of our lives this year.
[time=3529] I pray that with my whole heart with great thanksgiving in Jesus name, amen.
[time=3539] You
