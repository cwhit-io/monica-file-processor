[time=310] Well good morning everyone and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=314] Thank you for watching.
[time=315] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=316] I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=321] So glad that you're tuning in this morning and that you have been in some cases for many, many years.
[time=327] Thank you when you stop us on the street, when you tell us in person that you're watching, it's always an encouragement to know that you're tuning in, to know that you're part of our family.
[time=336] That's how we've seen you for these long years and how we see you today.
[time=342] We encourage you as we have many times before to come and to join us, to physically come
[time=348] to the building on a Sunday morning and let us know that you've been watching and even
[time=354] beyond that.
[time=355] We all understand there are times that you need to watch from home and that's why we're putting the program out there, but beyond that, we believe we're convinced that physical
[time=364] presence is also a good thing and we hope and we have hope for many, many years that
[time=370] the Bible Hour is a means by which this local church body, that's what it is primarily.
[time=377] This ministry, the Bible Hour is a ministry of Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=383] We are a local church body.
[time=385] We're committed to making Christ known around the world and part of that is this very television
[time=392] ministry.
[time=393] Thanks for being a part of it, but we believe the local church assembled together week by
[time=399] week celebrating around the Word of God, taking the sacraments together.
[time=404] Those are things that we believe we will be better because you are with us.
[time=410] So come, come and be with us.
[time=413] These are a little bit different in Sunday mornings around here.
[time=416] We just started this in recent days, but wanted to let you know about a change that we've been talking about again, but want to let you know again this morning that we have a nine o'clock Sunday school hour, for lack of a better way of saying it, where we're meeting in smaller communities.
[time=432] You've heard us say before that circles are better than rows.
[time=436] And so we've provided all over our campus places for you to come and to meet, to be with other people and engage in dialogue, engage in conversation.
[time=447] Just be in smaller settings with other people.
[time=449] So thanks for considering that.
[time=454] We have hundreds of people that are here week by week involved in those things would love for you to be a part of it.
[time=460] There's information on our website about all those different smaller settings, both during the week and on Sunday morning, please go to our website to www.blackhockministries.org
[time=474] and just check the connect button and all the different ways that we can meet and have
[time=480] met and will be meeting in the future.
[time=483] We hate for you to miss on that.
[time=485] We are meeting at 1030 for one gathering service these days.
[time=489] That was what I was getting to there.
[time=491] We have a nine o'clock community hour is how we're referring to it and a 1030 gathering
[time=497] service that we're now celebrating together.
[time=501] So part of the reason why we're going to this, the one gathering at 1030 is so we can make
[time=507] much of that nine o'clock community hour and would love for you to be a part of that.
[time=513] What a great way to get to know this place and for this place to get to know you.
[time=518] That's at nine o'clock.
[time=519] 1030 is again, the one gathering time that we're going to be pursuing here in 2015.
[time=527] We feel like it's going to be and this past Sunday was our first Sunday doing it.
[time=530] It was a time of really good energy.
[time=533] It was good to all be in the room together to see people that you wouldn't normally see on a Sunday morning.
[time=539] So we're excited about that.
[time=540] So if you're coming to be with us, note that change.
[time=543] Nine o'clock is the community hour, 1030 is our gathering time.
[time=549] So we're going to pursue that this year and we hope to pursue it with you.
[time=554] We're currently in a series on the Holy Spirit and we began that last week.
[time=561] We're continuing on today.
[time=562] You're going to hear from my good friend this morning, Josh rang on the Holy Spirit.
[time=568] Something I've been thinking about that's just struck me about the Holy Spirit that's been on my mind in these days is in Ephesians chapter one, Paul says that the Spirit is
[time=579] a guarantee.
[time=580] He's a deposit, a down payment of the inheritance that we will enjoy as sons and daughters of
[time=589] God by virtue of our relationship to Christ.
[time=592] That the Holy Spirit is this thing given to us as a down payment as a guarantee of our
[time=599] one day inheritance when we'll see him face to face.
[time=603] What a marvelous thing that is that he would come to be with us, that he is our present friend, our present possession.
[time=612] He's a comforter, he's a guide, he's a counselor, he's going to whisper truth to us when the enemy whispers lies.
[time=619] So we as a church family felt especially compelled in the dawning days of this new year that
[time=627] we would spend some time really focused on what does the scriptures say about the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of the person that follows Jesus.
[time=636] Francis Chan wrote a book called Forgotten God in part because he felt appropriately that
[time=642] the Holy Spirit as a member of the Godhead, as one God in three persons that he's been neglected.
[time=648] So we're hoping to address that in some ways in these weeks and we hope that you're encouraged by hope that you learn some things, about the Holy Spirit who is described by a number of different names and a number of different ways in the New Testament.
[time=662] So again, thank you for watching, thank you for being a part of our family.
[time=666] Please come to visit us in the coming days, reach out, write us a letter, send us an email,
[time=672] give us a call, just to let us know how we can do better, to let us know that you're watching in the first place.
[time=677] Thank you for being a part of our church family, please come see us, have a great day, have a great week.
[time=683] Thank you for being a part of our church family and we'll see you in the next one.
[time=685] Thank you for being a part of our church family.
[time=688] Thanks for watching.
[time=690] Thank you for being a part of our church family.
[time=1331] Nicodemus said to him, "How can these things be?" Jesus answered him, "Are you the teacher of Israel?
[time=1339] And you yet do not understand these things truly, truly, I say to you.
[time=1343] We speak of what we know and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony.
[time=1349] If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
[time=1356] No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the son of man.
[time=1362] And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him may have eternal life." Let's pray this morning.
[time=1376] Father, this morning we again, once again, time after time after time come and just say, "We need your help." Oh God, this morning, would you open our eyes?
[time=1391] Would you illuminate your truth?
[time=1394] God, maybe this morning for those who don't know you yet, would you convict them of their sin and their rebellion?
[time=1401] And would you illuminate them to understand your truth?
[time=1407] Would you teach them and would you point them to your son, Jesus?
[time=1414] God, we desperately need to hear from you today.
[time=1417] God, this world is just filled overflowing with claims of truth.
[time=1425] And yet we know that you alone have words of truth.
[time=1428] You alone have words of eternal life.
[time=1431] And so God, we're grateful for the work of your spirit.
[time=1434] We anticipate what he's going to do in each of our hearts this morning.
[time=1440] We give you great thanks ahead of time and great praise.
[time=1444] In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[time=1448] Well, in order to understand this rebirth and the work of the Holy Spirit, we're going to ask three questions this morning of our passage.
[time=1456] Why is the new birth so important?
[time=1460] How does the new birth happen and what does the new birth produce?
[time=1465] After those three questions, we'll look at one reminder that comes from our passage as well.
[time=1470] And so we'll use John chapter three as our main text, but we'll also launch from that to many other different passages that help us understand again a systematic theology of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1482] So question number one, why is the new birth so important?
[time=1490] We can look at our passage there in verse three.
[time=1493] Look at the repetition that it says here.
[time=1495] Jesus speaking to Nicodemus says this.
[time=1498] I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
[time=1506] Verse five, unless one is born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
[time=1515] Verse seven, you must be born again.
[time=1521] Do you see Jesus just coming back time and time again in the repetition of saints and Nicodemus?
[time=1528] Listen, Nicodemus, in order for you to be right with God, you have to be born again.
[time=1535] There's no other way around it.
[time=1538] What Jesus is communicating to Nicodemus is there is no other way to be saved except to be born again.
[time=1548] And unlike the rich young ruler, if you remember him, he came to Jesus saying, what must I do to be saved?
[time=1556] Nicodemus doesn't come asking those questions.
[time=1559] He isn't asking what he needs to do to be saved.
[time=1562] In his mind, he has the answers.
[time=1566] In his mind, he doesn't need help.
[time=1568] He perceives that this Jesus is certainly someone who is different who has authority, who teaches in a different way.
[time=1575] And in verse two, it says that even his miracles prove that he's different.
[time=1580] And he's coming, Nicodemus is coming on behalf of some of the Pharisees.
[time=1587] He comes at night, I think, because he's doing some kind of backdoor politicking.
[time=1594] He's coming to Jesus to see if we can kind of work together here.
[time=1598] Obviously, Jesus, you are a teacher.
[time=1600] I'm a teacher too, and those of us who are the rulers of Israel want to get in on this and see if we can collaborate.
[time=1609] Notice, he says that we, in verse two,
[time=1617] there's a man of Nicodemus of the Pharisees, a ruler of the Jews.
[time=1620] Verse two, this man came to Jesus by night and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher.
[time=1629] Not necessarily just Nicodemus.
[time=1632] See what's happening here is it's two radically different views colliding.
[time=1639] Up until the new teaching of Jesus, the religious culture was informed by the law of Moses.
[time=1645] And there were those who wrongly interpreted those laws.
[time=1649] Their religious process had been fine-tuned for hundreds of years and passed down through generations.
[time=1656] There was a system that highlighted obedience to the law of Moses, external conformity to the law, but it didn't get into the inside of who we are.
[time=1666] And the obedience counted as a source of spiritual security and right standing with God.
[time=1673] So when Jesus encounters Nicodemus, the Pharisee, Nicodemus, or Jesus, astonishes him by telling him all that you've done up to this point.
[time=1685] It doesn't matter.
[time=1687] You must be born again.
[time=1692] Here's a guy, Nicodemus, who joined an organization called the Pharisees,
[time=1698] an organization that stood for moral conformity to the letter of the laws.
[time=1703] But not only that, he was a ruler of the Jews.
[time=1706] Other passages indicate that he was a member of the Sanhedrin.
[time=1709] That's a group of 70 men plus the High Priest, which functioned like a spiritual supreme court for Israel.
[time=1719] He was a scribe.
[time=1721] He was a professional student.
[time=1723] In other words, in today's vernacular, he probably had a Ph.D. in religion from an Ivy League school.
[time=1731] He was an interpreter and teacher of the law.
[time=1733] He would have had large portions of the Old Testament memorized.
[time=1740] He was probably wealthy.
[time=1742] Here's a guy who had it all together among his peers.
[time=1747] Who had an answer for everything.
[time=1749] Who lived a tight moral structure.
[time=1751] Who people looked up to.
[time=1753] Who was serious about his religious thought and behavior.
[time=1756] And Jesus tells him, and no one's certain words, all of that doesn't matter.
[time=1761] You must be born again to be in a right relationship with God.
[time=1768] Well, why does Jesus do this?
[time=1771] He did it obviously for Nicodemus.
[time=1773] He does it for us today.
[time=1775] You see the message of the new birth.
[time=1777] This is what Tim Keller said.
[time=1779] The message of the new birth, the means of gaining a right standing with God is not a call to more morality and moral structure.
[time=1787] It's a challenge to it.
[time=1789] There has never been a message that is more radically against morality and religion than the message of the new birth.
[time=1799] That's powerful.
[time=1801] This is because at the core of who we are, when we look inside, our human condition is spiritually bankrupt.
[time=1813] And deep down, we all know this to be true.
[time=1819] No matter how many activities, spiritual activities or good deeds of activities that we try to bank on, there's still nothing to withdraw.
[time=1830] This is what theologians call the total inability of man.
[time=1835] It's what Scripture reveals about Nicodemus and what Scripture reveals about us.
[time=1840] Four truths quickly about the total inability of man.
[time=1844] Ephesians 2-1 tells us this, that we are spiritually dead.
[time=1850] Spiritually.
[time=1852] We have no vital signs apart from Christ, apart from the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives.
[time=1859] Ephesians says it this way, and you were dead in your trespasses and sins.
[time=1867] No ability to resuscitate oneself.
[time=1871] There's nothing there.
[time=1873] There's a spiritual corpse.
[time=1875] But not only that, we are by nature rebellious with a desire to do our own thing and to go our own way.
[time=1883] And that's a part of who we are.
[time=1885] Psalm 51 says this.
[time=1887] "Behold, David says, I was brought forth in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me."
[time=1896] Now he's not speaking of any kind of fact about his mother and how she became pregnant.
[time=1904] What he's talking about is this, that when he was born, that he had a sin nature already ingrained in who he was.
[time=1911] And that sin nature caused him to want to rebel against God, to do his own thing and to go his own way.
[time=1920] It's our polluted roots.
[time=1922] Romans 5, 12 says it this way.
[time=1924] "Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, Adam, and death through sin, so death spread to all men because all have sinned."
[time=1933] And so all of humanity in Adam is counted as a sinner because it's a part of who we are by nature.
[time=1941] Certainly doesn't mean that there aren't a lot of good people out there doing a lot of good deeds.
[time=1948] And yet when we peel everyone back at the core of who we are, we have a nature that is bent toward doing our own thing and running from God, not running to God.
[time=1961] So we're spiritually dead.
[time=1965] We're spiritually rebellious.
[time=1968] And third, we can't change.
[time=1971] Left to ourselves, to our natural bent, we cannot change.
[time=1975] We sang it this morning, but Jeremiah 13, 23 says this.
[time=1979] Can an Ethiopian change his skin or a leopard change its spots?
[time=1988] Neither can you do good who are accustomed to doing evil.
[time=1994] There's no power in us to change.
[time=1999] 1 Corinthians 2 says it this way.
[time=2001] The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God.
[time=2011] The natural person does not even accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him.
[time=2017] And it says here that he is not able to understand them because they're spiritually discerned.
[time=2024] But not only those things, a fourth is this, that Satan is at work in our world.
[time=2030] 2 Corinthians 4 says this, and even if our gospel is veiled, it's veiled to those who are perishing.
[time=2034] In their case, the God of this world, Satan, has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ.
[time=2050] You see what's going on here is that humanity has an AM receiver and yet the gospel is transmitted on an FM band.
[time=2060] We need completely rewired.
[time=2063] The only hope Nicodemus had and the only hope the rest of mankind has in order to be made right with God is to be born again.
[time=2076] That's the first question, why is this so important? You must be born again.
[time=2081] Second question, how does the new birth happen?
[time=2084] Look at verses 5 through 8 and the emphasis upon the Spirit.
[time=2087] He uses the word spirit or the person of the Spirit three times in those four verses.
[time=2092] But in verse 5 it says this, Jesus answered, "Truly I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God."
[time=2100] That water is talking about a water baptism. We do water baptism here at our church and that's just an outward sign of hopefully what's happened inwardly.
[time=2112] That water baptism doesn't save and that's what Jesus is talking about.
[time=2116] The water baptism isn't saving you. It's the spiritual baptism being baptized by the Spirit that saves you.
[time=2124] Only who is born of water and Spirit can enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.
[time=2131] Do not marvel that I said to you, you must be born again.
[time=2137] Being born again, how does it happen? It's completely dependent upon the work or the role of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2144] Being born again has to be done to you in the three different references here.
[time=2152] All of those verbs, I know you guys love it when I go to English class, right?
[time=2157] Let's go to grammar. All of those verbs are passive verbs.
[time=2161] Do you remember the difference between passive and active verbs?
[time=2164] An active verb means the noun does the subject, right?
[time=2168] A passive verb means that the noun is getting acted upon.
[time=2173] Someone else is doing the action for them.
[time=2177] So what this is saying is this, is that in order to be born again, it has to be done from someone else on the outside in.
[time=2187] It's not you being born again by yourself. It's a passive verb to be born again.
[time=2193] The rebirth or regeneration is a supernatural occurrence.
[time=2200] And the Holy Spirit is the agent who takes the work of Christ and applies it to the individual.
[time=2208] So we've already seen in Christ's dialogue with Nicodemus, this being born again isn't produced by keeping the law,
[time=2219] not produced by being some stellar moral person.
[time=2224] It's happened. It doesn't happen because of anything that we could do.
[time=2230] It happens because of the kindness of God.
[time=2233] John chapter 1, three references here real quick that all say the same thing.
[time=2239] John chapter 1, "To all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, those who are born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of the man, but of God's will." James 1, 18, "Of his own will he brought us forth." 1 Peter 1, 3, "He has caused us to be born again to a living hope."
[time=2269] It's God's will. And God, through his will, through the work of Christ at Calvary,
[time=2276] the Holy Spirit brings that together and works in our heart and our mind
[time=2282] in this rebirth area in four different ways that I want to highlight.
[time=2288] Number one is he convicts you of your sin.
[time=2293] You see, apart from him doing that, we wouldn't have an idea of our sin and said we would suppress our sin,
[time=2299] but the Holy Spirit convicts us of that sin.
[time=2302] John 16, he says this, "Nevertheless, I tell you the truth, it's to your advantage that I go away," says Jesus, "for if I do not go away, the helper will not come.
[time=2312] But if I go, I'll send him to you, and when he comes the Spirit, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment."
[time=2322] You see, the Holy Spirit internally is helping us understand that we are sinners.
[time=2327] He brings that conviction, and he also illuminates.
[time=2333] He turns the light on to spiritual reality.
[time=2337] Remember how Satan was blinding the eyes of the unbelieving?
[time=2341] The Holy Spirit does the opposite. He actually enlightens the eyes.
[time=2348] First Corinthians 2, "These things God has revealed to us through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God, for who knows a person's thought except the Spirit of that person which is in him?" So also, no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
[time=2366] Now we have received not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit who's from God,
[time=2372] that we might understand the things freely given us by God.
[time=2378] He illuminates, he helps us understand truth.
[time=2383] He teaches in John 14, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name.
[time=2388] He will teach you all things.
[time=2391] Bring to remembrance all that I've said to you.
[time=2395] And fourth, finally here, he points to Jesus, John 15.
[time=2400] But when the helper comes, who I will send to you from the Father, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me.
[time=2410] So the Holy Spirit in this reburthing is so active, he's convicting, he's illuminating,
[time=2416] he's teaching, he's pointing to Jesus where there's power in his blood to save.
[time=2426] To save sinners who cannot save themselves, who are spiritually dead, who are unable to change themselves.
[time=2435] So why is the new birth so important?
[time=2438] You must be born again to be made right with God.
[time=2442] How does the new birth happen?
[time=2444] Completely by the work of the Spirit as he convicts, illuminates, teaches, and points to Jesus.
[time=2450] Third, what does the new birth produce?
[time=2453] Look at verse 8.
[time=2456] The wind blows where it wishes and you hear it sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes.
[time=2461] So it is with everyone who's born of the Spirit.
[time=2464] There are many truths to glean from verse 8, but I want to point your eye to the phrase you hear it sound.
[time=2472] In other words, the new birth or being born again, it's hard to explain and somewhat mysterious, but its impact will be seen.
[time=2482] It will result in an impact.
[time=2486] Verse 6 says this.
[time=2490] That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit. In other words, if you're fleshly, you're going to do fleshly things, but if you're spiritual, you're going to do spirit-filled things.
[time=2505] Morality has nothing to do with securing the new birth, but morality and good works will flow out of the new birth.
[time=2518] If we notice and we don't have time to go there, but this verse, this dialogue starts with Moses in that Nicodemus was a Pharisee that he was living his life in accordance with the law of Moses and then it ends with Moses.
[time=2533] As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, which we'll get to, but Jesus is just showing Nicodemus that this Moses, who you know about, you know about his law, he was a mediator that helped people turn to the coming one, the Messiah, Jesus himself.
[time=2555] The new birth, it's not simply just behavior modification.
[time=2561] It's not just simply doing a few things differently.
[time=2566] It's not a moral undertaking.
[time=2571] The new birth is instantaneous and a radical new work in the life of an individual.
[time=2577] It's instantaneous in that whenever the new birth is mentioned, it's always in the Greek, it's either an herist or a perfect tense.
[time=2585] That just simply means herist again is something that happens in a point in time.
[time=2589] It's done, and the perfect tense just has the idea that it's completed perfectly. Nothing else has to be done to it.
[time=2598] It's instantaneous. It's a radical new work.
[time=2605] We could describe it in lots of different ways this morning, but let's take a look at two different ways. One, it's psychologically radical.
[time=2612] Say, what are you talking about?
[time=2615] Will you become a different person with new longings
[time=2621] and new affections and new desires?
[time=2626] It's not schizophrenia, but you really do become a new person, and you can remember the things that you used to do, but you begin forgetting why you even like to do those things.
[time=2643] Yes, we will still deal with what theologians call a "homartiological hangover."
[time=2649] Homartios is the Greek word for sin, so it's just this idea that, yes, even though we're a believer, we're still going to have impact from our sinful roots.
[time=2658] We still have this sin hangover that we have to deal with.
[time=2661] Our flesh will not be gone until we're glorified, but when the spirit enters in and makes us new, we're a completely different person.
[time=2670] It's just not that we've had some sort of modification to us.
[time=2674] He makes us completely new.
[time=2678] The video showed at the end, 2 Corinthians 5, 17, if anybody is in Christ, he's a new creature.
[time=2685] Old things have gone, behold, new things have come.
[time=2690] There's a story of Augustine that's told, and before Augustine came to know the Lord back in his day, he was a little bit of a promiscuous person, and the story is told of him visiting a city that he once visited, and there was a young lady that came up to him who he had a promiscuous relationship with.
[time=2707] And she came up to him, and he was kind and he was nice, but he simply just moved right on.
[time=2715] And the young lady, it's told, stops from it and thinks, well, maybe he just doesn't remember who I am.
[time=2723] And so she calls out to him and says, Augustine, it is I.
[time=2728] And he replies, yes, but it is not I.
[time=2736] The difference, he's been changed.
[time=2739] He's not the same person that he once was.
[time=2744] I can think of that same thing with the life of Josh Rang.
[time=2750] As I look back to the ways that God has just changed me in different ways.
[time=2758] Steve Longbrake sitting down right there, he could tell you lots of different ways that maybe I've changed.
[time=2763] But I remember one time in my life, my junior year of high school.
[time=2768] Boy, basketball was so important to me.
[time=2771] I played in the gym across the street.
[time=2774] Steve came to me one day, he was my coach, he was my principal.
[time=2779] And he gently, I would say, just came and reminded me and confronted me of just my pride.
[time=2788] That I was full of myself.
[time=2792] And I remember those days, praise the Lord that, yes, I still deal with pride in some ways, but it's not nearly what it used to be.
[time=2800] It is not I anymore.
[time=2803] And I'm thankful that the Lord has made that a different.
[time=2808] It's psychologically radical.
[time=2810] It's organically radical.
[time=2814] What do you mean by organic?
[time=2816] Well, I thought, you know, that's a pretty hot term these days, right?
[time=2818] So why not use organically?
[time=2820] But here's the idea of organically different.
[time=2823] It comes from new roots.
[time=2826] You know, if we had, if I had an apple orchard, and this year I came to that apple orchard and said, you know what?
[time=2832] This year I want to just, I want peaches to come.
[time=2837] I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to grow peaches this year.
[time=2839] And so I'm going to, I'm going to do everything I did and cultivate those apple trees and do everything I can to make sure that they're productive and efficient.
[time=2846] And I go to, you know, get my produce and there's no peaches, right?
[time=2854] Apples again, because you got to go back and you got to replace the root.
[time=2859] You've got to start with a different seed.
[time=2863] That's what God does in Christ.
[time=2866] He plants you new differently.
[time=2870] So now you can produce new fruit that's in accordance with what He has done for you in the gospel.
[time=2880] This whole idea of what the gospel produces, Rick Raber will talk more about, but it has an impact.
[time=2887] We may not know how it happens behind the scenes, but there is a change in the life of those who are born again.
[time=2895] Why is the new birth so important?
[time=2897] You must be born again. How does the new birth happen completely by the work of the Spirit as He convicts, illuminates, teaches and points to Jesus?
[time=2905] Third question, what does the new birth produce a changed life?
[time=2909] Well, those three questions lead us to a one reminder.
[time=2914] The reminder comes in those last verses that we read in John chapter three.
[time=2918] The reminder is this, it's for everybody.
[time=2920] Jesus is the Savior who makes the new birth possible.
[time=2926] Look at what it says in verse two as we understand the context again.
[time=2930] Nicodemus comes, he comes to Jesus and he says this, Raber, we know that you are a teacher come from God.
[time=2939] What did Nicodemus come for?
[time=2942] And what did Jesus turn it into?
[time=2946] Well, Nicodemus came and he had an academic paradigm.
[time=2953] What can I learn? What am I missing?
[time=2956] Let's collaborate. What can you teach me?
[time=2960] Jesus has a completely different paradigm. He has a heart paradigm.
[time=2966] Jesus has a heart paradigm.
[time=2968] You're learning your morality, your reputation, all of it Nicodemus has nothing to do with being right with God.
[time=2974] You need the Spirit to regenerate you and cause you to be born again.
[time=2979] You see what Jesus is doing? He's saying, I didn't come primarily to be a teacher.
[time=2984] I came primarily to go to a cross and to be lifted up and to take your sin, Nicodemus, and take all of it away, if you would be born again, if you would trust in me.
[time=3008] You see where he goes? Verse 13, 14, 15.
[time=3014] Nicodemus says he's from God, but Jesus says this, no one has ascended into heaven except he who has descended from heaven, the Son of Man.
[time=3023] Jesus says, listen, yes indeed I came from heaven, but I am way more than you think I am.
[time=3028] I'm the very Son of God.
[time=3032] And then in verse 14, he uses this story from Numbers chapter 21 where the people of Israel were disobedient to God and part of that judgment is there were snakes that would come and that would bite them and many of them had passed away.
[time=3046] And in all that was going on, Jesus or God said to Moses, make a bronze serpent and lift up the serpent and all of the people of Israel who look to that serpent will be saved.
[time=3061] He's communicating in Nicodemus that in the very near future, he will be lifted up.
[time=3072] And those who have been struck by sin, which is everyone, all of us, if we would simply look to him who would be lifted up.
[time=3090] It says at the end of that passage, whoever believes in me may have eternal life.
[time=3102] You see, Nicodemus came for teaching, Nicodemus came for collaboration, Nicodemus came for backroom politicking.
[time=3111] And Jesus says, no, no, it's not about that Nicodemus, you're on a completely different paradigm.
[time=3116] You need to understand that I didn't come to primarily be a moral teacher.
[time=3120] I came primarily to be the Savior of the world and your Savior as well, Nicodemus.
[time=3126] And your Savior this morning, if you have been yet to be born again.
[time=3132] This is the good news of the Gospel.
[time=3138] That every single human who understands their spiritual bankruptcy, that understands that they have a natural bent to run away from God, not to God.
[time=3151] And as a part of that rebellion that we deserve to be judged by God.
[time=3157] And yet God in his kindness sent forth his Son Jesus, that he would be lifted up, that he would spread his arms on the cross at Calvary.
[time=3169] And he would take upon himself the very judgment that you and I deserve.
[time=3179] It's the good news of the Gospel.
[time=3184] John 3's an amazing passage of Scripture, so much more that we could get from it.
[time=3188] But this morning as we close, three words that I'd like you to go with this morning.
[time=3196] Three words, gratitude, humility, and praise.
[time=3206] The first word, gratitude. What it says in verse three of John chapter three again in our passage.
[time=3213] He says truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
[time=3221] But when you are born again, you can see the kingdom of God.
[time=3225] You see things differently.
[time=3227] You see your sin.
[time=3228] You see Satan's lives for what they are.
[time=3231] You can behold the beauty of Christ.
[time=3233] You see that it's not about you and it's not about our time on this earth even.
[time=3237] You see your child's sin and now you're sad for them instead of angry at them.
[time=3242] You see God's laws now as his love and his grace, not him being burdensome.
[time=3248] You just, you see things differently.
[time=3251] God has opened your eyes to see the kingdom of God.
[time=3257] Let's be grateful that he's illuminated us.
[time=3262] But not only that, the realities of the new birth, that when we question this, Romans 8 tells us,
[time=3268] the spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.
[time=3274] And if we're children, then we're heirs.
[time=3278] Reality of the new birth, 1 Peter 2, 9, we are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,
[time=3285] a people for his own possession that we may proclaim the excellency of him who's called us.
[time=3293] Out of darkness and into his marvelous light, Colossians 2, a reality of the new birth,
[time=3299] and you who were dead in your trespasses and uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our sin.
[time=3310] It's gone, not to be remembered or reckoned anymore.
[time=3316] A reality of the new birth, Romans 6, 7 and 14, we know that our old self, our old flesh,
[time=3322] was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be wrought to nothing so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin, for one who has died has been set free from sin.
[time=3333] Sin will have no dominion over you since you are not under law anymore, but under grace.
[time=3339] A reality of the new birth, oh, let's be a grateful people.
[time=3344] Gratitude oozing out of who we are for all that he has done for us, humility, humility.
[time=3355] Is there some hard truths?
[time=3359] I know there are lots of people that I run into that don't want to admit that they are unable to change and that they are spiritually bankrupt.
[time=3368] Can I just encourage all of you?
[time=3372] There needs to be a humility for God's grace to come in.
[time=3376] 1 Peter 5, James 4 says, "But God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
[time=3385] Would you just fall to your knees and say, "God, I need you.
[time=3392] I need you. Oh, every hour I need you." Let's not take credit for God's doing.
[time=3401] And then when we think about our ministry to others, how important is it for us to pray that the Holy Spirit would do his work that he would convict and illuminate and teach and point others to Jesus, who so desperately need to hear him?
[time=3417] And can I just help you, as long as you point to Jesus, you can't mess it up.
[time=3423] You can't say something wrong or you can't say something right enough to convince somebody to come to Christ.
[time=3431] People even left Jesus when he was talking, right?
[time=3438] And then humility, just receive Christ today.
[time=3440] If you've not been born again, oh, would you receive him?
[time=3444] Would you understand if he loves you more than anyone ever has or could?
[time=3449] He's done more for you than anybody ever has done.
[time=3453] He's died for you.
[time=3457] Gratitude, humility, and praise.
[time=3461] I can't think of anybody who deserves more of our praise, of our adoration, of our time, of our attention, of our silver, of our gold, of our lives
[time=3471] than God, because of all that he has done.
[time=3476] God, thank you so much this morning.
[time=3479] Thank you that we can glean some things at the power of your spirit from this dialogue between Nicodemus and Jesus.
[time=3488] God, would you cultivate in our hearts gratitude and humility and praise for you?
[time=3494] Thank you for what you're doing.
[time=3497] God, this morning, I pray specifically.
[time=3501] For those who might be here, those who might be listening, who have not yet to be born again, maybe say they think they've gone too far, God, or maybe they think they're good enough.
[time=3516] But Lord, would you illuminate them?
[time=3519] Would you convict them of their sin?
[time=3522] And would you teach them the beauty of Jesus and point them to your son?
[time=3529] Oh, God, would you do that, please?
[time=3533] We pray this in Christ's name, amen.
[time=3559] God, thank you.
