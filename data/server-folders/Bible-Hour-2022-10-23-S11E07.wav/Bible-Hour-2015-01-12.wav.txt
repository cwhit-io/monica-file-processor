[time=60] - Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=63] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=64] I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Huck Ministries.
[time=67] I love being a part of the team.
[time=69] We love here to give you a look in to what our service is like on Sunday mornings.
[time=76] The Bible Hour exists to give you a look into what we're doing.
[time=81] And our fellowship here at 7,400 East State Boulevard, we regularly invite you to come physically be a part of that.
[time=89] And so I just invite you again today to consider in this new year, I got to meet a few people in the last couple of weeks that in the new year have resolved to come and be a part of what we're doing here, to physically come and be a presence.
[time=104] So I wanna invite you to that as well this morning.
[time=108] Lately, we've been talking about the Holy Spirit.
[time=111] And there's a lot to say about the Holy Spirit.
[time=113] You can't really read the Bible without getting a pretty clear view that his activity is essential, that there's one God revealed in the Bible in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[time=126] We chose a bunch of our words to kind of frame up our series on the Holy Spirit.
[time=131] We did restart, we did rebirth.
[time=134] Last week with my friend Josh Rang, this week we're gonna talk about reside.
[time=138] It's the New Testament's clear conviction and teaching that when a person is in Christ, when they have confessed with their mouth, Jesus is Lord and believe in their heart that God raised in from the dead, and they are saved, that's the Bible's language.
[time=152] The Holy Spirit then comes and takes up residence within them.
[time=155] The Bible is filled up with references to that.
[time=158] And I'm gonna list several of those for you this morning.
[time=162] Also wanted to clear up a couple of things.
[time=164] It seems like the first couple of weeks of the series, we were talking a lot about Jesus in a series on the Holy Spirit.
[time=170] Maybe you've been wondering about that.
[time=171] I wanted to be clear and lay out before you this, that the New Testament is profoundly clear that you can't talk about one without the other.
[time=181] In fact, Jesus says, as I'll relate to you this morning, that the Holy Spirit will not bear witness of himself.
[time=188] He's only gonna say what Jesus in effect tells him to say.
[time=193] In fact, he's referred to as the spirit of Jesus in the New Testament.
[time=197] So there's no daylight between the Holy Spirit and Jesus.
[time=201] That's why we spent so much time, the first two weeks of the series, talking about Jesus in this series on the Holy Spirit.
[time=207] So to be clear, that's gonna be talked about this morning.
[time=210] Very excited about laying out before you this wonderful truth that the Holy Spirit comes to take up residence within a person that aligns with Jesus and that God's spirit dwells within us.
[time=222] And we are what the scriptures refer to as the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[time=226] So much to say on that, I can't wait for you to see that.
[time=229] When it also, just to remind you that you can go on our website under the media tab and there's a latest bulletin feature there under media, blackhockbenistries.org.
[time=239] If you click on the media tab and you scroll down to latest bulletin, it'll give you all the things in our outline for this morning.
[time=246] After the Holy Spirit series, we're gonna go into a series called Four Days, referring to the last four days of Jesus' life.
[time=252] The Bible has this very specific focus on Jesus.
[time=256] And even beyond that, it has a focus on the last week of his life.
[time=263] So what we're doing is trying to focus on the things the Bible focuses on.
[time=267] And we're gonna end up, as you would expect, on Resurrection Sunday.
[time=271] So we would love for you to come and visit us during this series as we take a really close look at Jesus and what his appearing and what his life has meant.
[time=280] It's hard to overstate that.
[time=283] So come and visit us.
[time=284] Again, we encourage you.
[time=285] And we thank you for watching all these years and for being apart.
[time=289] If you've been watching for many, many years, you know that we've invited people in the past to sponsorship, to sponsor a specific broadcast of the Bible Hour.
[time=299] You can sponsor a broadcast for a birthday.
[time=302] You can sponsor a broadcast in memory of a loved one or celebrate an anniversary.
[time=307] So we wanna invite you to that again this morning because you're part of our family.
[time=311] And because you've been watching for so many years, this is a very specific and very tangible way for you to be involved in supporting the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=320] Today's broadcast, for example, is going to be sponsored in memory of a loved one.
[time=327] So we invite you to consider that this morning.
[time=329] All the information about doing that and contacting is at the bottom of the screen.
[time=333] Thank you again for watching.
[time=335] Thank you for being a part of our family.
[time=336] We encourage you, as we always do, to come and see us, come say hello, tell us how we're doing well, tell us how we could do better.
[time=343] Thanks for watching and have a great week.

[time=519] (upbeat music) - Hey, man, praise God.
[time=533] (audience applauding) - Good morning, everybody.
[time=543] This morning, we have around the room the elements, the elements of communion, bread and a cup.
[time=553] We do this regularly here at Black Hawk Ministries
[time=559] because Jesus told us to, that to do it often in remembrance of him and what he has done.
[time=567] So we'll stay a couple of things at this moment and then we're gonna worship together with music and we'll invite you to come and get the elements as you are prompted, as you are prepared, as you are ready.
[time=580] I've read in this book for a few months and I read this with a choir earlier this morning and I just, I think it's something that we all need to hear in preparation for what we're about to do.
[time=591] So let me ask you just to take a minute.
[time=594] It's been a long week for a lot of us and you need to be comforted and I wanna read you some comfort this morning.
[time=603] You are flustered and uneasy.
[time=607] Feel for the hand of God your father and be sure that he is your father.
[time=614] Thinking of you with a father's care and you will find a hand does close on yours.
[time=622] Or you are disconcerted that so little seems to come of all your spiritual strivings.
[time=629] Turn to the cross again, looking up at it, really take in that it is not upon your own poor efforts and weak will, but upon God's eternal plans and dearest wish that you lean and that will rally you.
[time=648] Or you are baffled and beaten and it seems no use trying any further.
[time=654] Sink your tired, fretted mind deep down into the infinite deeps of God's unthinkable majesty and patience and like people knowing they are saved, so will you feel strong walls about you.
[time=671] You will find yourself in a cool, sheltered place with your breath once again, better than that, will like Paul fling yourself unafraid once more into the fight, knowing that he that is with you is more than all they that can be against you and through him you can do all things.
[time=691] Let's pray.
[time=694] Father, your word admonishes us that we should approach what we're about to do reverently, humbly with a deep sense of awe and thanksgiving.
[time=710] And so God, may it be so.
[time=712] I pray that all those this morning that not merely God know about you but that know you would come and partake of these elements and so doing proclaim your death, the effectiveness of that death in their own life, God for forgiveness of sins.
[time=728] God, this table is an occasion for several things, for reflection, may it be so.
[time=734] This table is an opportunity for thanksgiving.
[time=738] God, may it be so.
[time=740] This table is an opportunity for comfort to know that everything necessary for the sin debt that we have has already been paid.
[time=749] We are reminded of that, O Heavenly Father.
[time=753] And so I pray for my brothers and sisters in this room that as we sing and as we pray and as we meditate on your words to us, that we would be ready, that we would be careful, that we would be thankful, I'll pray all those things in Jesus' name on that.
