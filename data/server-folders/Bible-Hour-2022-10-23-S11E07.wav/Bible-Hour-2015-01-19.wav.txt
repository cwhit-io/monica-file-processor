[time=18] (upbeat music)
[time=60] - Well, good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=62] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=63] I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and we're really excited about what God is doing in this place.
[time=70] We're excited about the Holy Spirit series that we have been in for several weeks and remain in on the broadcast this morning.
[time=77] My good friend, Rick Raber, is gonna be presenting to you this morning about real life.
[time=83] And I can't tell you how important this message is.
[time=87] And I wanna just take a minute and tell you why.
[time=89] It's important.
[time=91] A lot of people that I've talked to you personally, so it's not like I've heard a lot of people somewhere, but people I've talked to you personally had told me, well, see if I can't go to church, 'cause I can't measure up.
[time=101] I can't be good enough.
[time=104] I have too many things in my life that I've done that I just can't get straight.
[time=108] And I have to get those things straight before I come to church.
[time=113] And we are delighted in this place to preach.
[time=117] And we have been preaching for many, many years, the truth that that mindset is not correct.
[time=124] And we wanna graciously, lovingly, gently tell you this morning that everyone knows that you can't good enough.
[time=130] Nobody can do it good enough.
[time=132] This morning, my friend, Rick is gonna talk to you about real life and this war that's waging between our flesh and our spirit.
[time=139] God has expectations of you that can be met.
[time=143] They have been met in the person of Jesus.
[time=146] That's why it's called Good News.
[time=148] And so the church isn't a museum for perfect people.
[time=152] It's a hospital for broken people.
[time=154] And so we wanna invite you into that.
[time=156] And this morning, I cannot wait for you to listen to what God's word has to say about real life.
[time=163] Real life, not the life that people tend to think is going on in church and all these shiny, happy people walking around, we are broken people, redeemed people by the grace of God, but broken, hurting people in need of the Holy Spirit's guidance, care and protection and help every single day.
[time=183] That's what you're gonna hear this morning.
[time=184] And I think there is probably not a message that we could give to you that's more important, more timely than that one this morning.
[time=193] We are in a season of transition at Black Ock.
[time=196] It's been going on for several months now.
[time=198] And part of that transition is that we are now having one worship service.
[time=202] We have a nine o'clock community hour where we are inviting people all over the campus to gather together.
[time=210] We believe that circles are better than rows.
[time=213] And we're inviting people into that nine o'clock hour.
[time=217] Then 1030, we're all meeting in the sanctuary for our gathering.
[time=221] So we continually invite you to come be a part of what we're doing here.
[time=225] We invite you to come be a part physically present in our gathering.
[time=228] So if you're coming, know that we're starting at 1030 and not 1045 as we had.
[time=233] There is no nine o'clock service as there had been.
[time=236] So again, nine o'clock community hour, 1030 is our gathering.
[time=241] That's our Sunday morning experience that we're inviting people to.
[time=244] Certainly gathering in smaller settings that life change really happens there.
[time=248] But we're also inviting people into the gathering to hear worship and music to be a part of the larger gathering of the church.
[time=258] As I mentioned earlier, the church isn't a place to which you come.
[time=262] The church in the New Testament is people.
[time=264] It's the church gathered here at Black Hawk.
[time=267] So you may have heard me say over the months the church at Black Hawk.
[time=271] That's why I refer to it in the way that I do.
[time=274] This morning, we're grateful that you are watching and that you have been watching in some cases for many, many years.
[time=282] The sponsorship option that you've seen from us before that you see even saw if you're watching last week is available to you.
[time=289] You can sponsor a specific broadcast of the Bible Hour for any number of reasons.
[time=294] You can sponsor a broadcast in memory of a loved one as was done last week.
[time=298] You can sponsor a broadcast for anniversary or for a special birthday coming up.
[time=303] It is remarkably encouraging to us to hear you say that you're watching.
[time=307] To hear you say that you are a part of our family in that way.
[time=311] What a better way to be a part of what we're doing here than to sponsor a broadcast of the Bible Hour.
[time=318] Again, all the information about what it looks like to sponsor a broadcast of the Bible Hour is on the bottom of the screen.
[time=325] We often invite you again to come be physically present with us and that might not be possible for some of you right now.
[time=332] But what is possible is for you to be involved in the ministry in that way.
[time=336] We have been delighted to offer this ministry to our community for many, many years.
[time=340] And your donation, your sponsorship is gonna be part of that in an ongoing fashion moving forward.
[time=347] So we're so glad that you're watching today, friends.
[time=351] Thank you for being a part of what we're doing here.
[time=353] We're glad that you're tuning in.
[time=355] Be encouraged this morning to know that the gospel is good news.
[time=358] And it's good news because God knows we know and you should know too that you can't do it good enough because Christ has done it for you.
[time=368] You can rest in that this morning.
[time=370] So I can't wait for you to hear what my friend Rick is gonna say.
[time=372] Please can be part of our gathering at 1030 or community at nine o'clock in the morning.
[time=376] And again, take advantage of the opportunity to sponsor a broadcast of the Bible Hour.
[time=380] Have a great week and God bless.

[time=406] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 53 seconds]
[time=464] - I walked around this morning a little bit
[time=473] and shook a few hands here.
[time=475] And I have to confess, one of my pet peeves is this concept that we do in church every Sunday morning and often in other places.
[time=486] With this lovely question, how are you?
[time=488] How are you?
[time=489] Everybody goes, fine, fine, fine.
[time=492] Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine, everything's fine.
[time=495] I really struggle with that.
[time=500] Many operate even from the principle that says, if I really told Todd what I thought was going on in my heart, he really wouldn't care anyhow.
[time=510] And so we just continue saying, fine, fine, fine.
[time=517] And the reality is, is that you had weeks like mine and it wasn't all fine, was it?
[time=525] Some of you had health issues, some of you had relational issues with kids, some of you had relational issues with your spouse.
[time=534] But the truth is, we have to make sure
[time=540] that we don't set ourself up and nurture an environment that does not acknowledge the war that's waging in our members that Paul talks about.
[time=550] One of the things that happens is after a season,
[time=557] new believers that come into this place in the newness and the hate for their sin kind of waves a little bit.
[time=565] And all of a sudden they come into the sanctuary and everybody walks around, fine, fine, fine.
[time=572] We have to be careful that we don't set them up to a spot that makes them wrestle inappropriately and think what in the world's wrong with me.
[time=583] Harry Ironsides was the guy that followed Dale Moody at the Moody Church in Chicago.
[time=590] Really prominent preacher, really prominent preacher.
[time=595] Him and a guy by the name of J.I. Packer, some of you may have read the book, Knowing God.
[time=602] Those two guys are pillars in the Christian faith.
[time=606] The truth is that both of them got to the spot that one of them was checked in to a mental institution because he didn't understand why in the world everybody else was walking along fine and he was waging this war in him.
[time=624] What's going on?
[time=627] He knew that he was Christ but why in the world was everybody else okay and he's waging the war.
[time=634] J.I. Packer contemplated suicide.
[time=637] Is everything fine?
[time=643] The truth is is the blood of Christ has taken this to that spot.
[time=649] Webby commented last week in 2 Corinthians 3, 17 to 18.
[time=658] It's about freedom.
[time=659] The Lord is spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom and we with unveiled faces all contemplate and behold God's glory and we are being transformed into his likeness with every increasing glory which comes for the Lord who is the spirit, who is the spirit and he is real, he is real, he's not in it.
[time=682] I submit to you this morning that we wanna talk about
[time=688] what it means to be real and authentic and the blood of Christ covered it all.
[time=696] She's got a slide here that we're gonna bring up.
[time=697] Some of you may recognize this slide of the velveteen rabbit.
[time=702] The story of the velveteen rabbit is priceless but he gives a great description here of what it means to be real.
[time=708] What is real said ask the rabbit one day when they were lying side by side near the fruit nursery fender before Nana came to tidy the room, does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick out handle?
[time=721] Real isn't how you are made said the skin horse.
[time=726] It's a thing that happens to you.
[time=728] When your child loves you for a long, long time not just to play with but really loves you then you become real.
[time=735] Does it hurt?
[time=736] Ask the rabbit.
[time=737] Sometimes said the skin horse for he was always truthful.
[time=743] When you're a real you don't mind being hurt.
[time=747] Does it happen all at once?
[time=749] Like being wound up?
[time=751] Or just bit by bit he asked.
[time=753] It doesn't happen all at once said the skin horse.
[time=758] You become.
[time=758] It takes a long time.
[time=762] That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily or have sharp edges or have to be carefully kept.
[time=771] Generally by the time you are real most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby.
[time=782] But these things don't matter at all because once you're real you can't be ugly except to people who don't understand.
[time=794] I submit to you one of the reasons that we so resist being real is because we're scared to death of somebody seeing our ugly.
[time=808] The Holy Spirit by his ministry in our life
[time=820] gives us an opportunity to see our ugly totally different.
[time=826] Totally, totally different.
[time=829] But what does it mean to be real?
[time=831] I can tell you this, as much as I love this song I'll tell you this.
[time=836] It doesn't have this connotation that we all think about being happy.
[time=841] Happy, happy all the day.
[time=843] Thereby faith I received by sight.
[time=846] There's a joy component.
[time=849] There's a reality.
[time=850] There's a connection with reality that doesn't mean everything's happy, happy, fine all the time.
[time=855] There's freedom that we're talking about.
[time=861] This freedom that we're talking about is freedom from sin and it's really far from the fantasy world of the Velveteen Rabbit.
[time=872] The passage says where the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom and the Lord is the Spirit.
[time=883] This concept of what it means for us to be filled with the spirit, having the spirit, all these things.
[time=889] It has deep roots and it goes all the way back to Genesis.
[time=894] So if you flip with me to Genesis chapter one you won't see it come up on the screen.
[time=899] But Genesis chapter one gets to the core of God's design for us.
[time=904] God's design chapter one, verse two is the first place that the spirits mentioned pretty early, you can't get much earlier than that.
[time=913] In the passage of the scripture.
[time=915] Genesis chapter one, verse two, it says now the earth was formless and empty, dark was over it in the surface of the deep and the spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
[time=924] He was there already then.
[time=925] But I want to go down and I want to highlight for you a concept that is absolutely paramount to us understanding what it means for us to be in Christ.
[time=937] Look down at Genesis one, 11.
[time=941] Genesis one and 11, let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, fruit trees bearing fruit in which it was there seed, each according to its kind.
[time=950] Catch that phrase right there, according to its kind on the earth.
[time=953] The land produced vegetation, plants bearing seed, verse 12, according to their kinds, trees bearing fruit with seed in it, according to their kinds.
[time=963] And God saw it and it was good.
[time=965] Jump down to verse 21.
[time=966] So God created the great creatures of the sea and on every living thing and moving thing with which the water teams according to their kinds.
[time=975] Every winged bird, verse 24, let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds, livestock, creatures, move along the ground, wild animals, each according to its kind.
[time=990] You get the idea, verse 26.
[time=992] And God said, let us make man in our image.
[time=1000] See, by design, by design, God's kingdom works according to its kind.
[time=1011] It works according to its kind.
[time=1014] She's gonna bring up a slide here that's right straight from the reality of the raver place and it deals with cattle.
[time=1022] That would be an Angus bull.
[time=1026] The next one will show us a Hurford cow.
[time=1029] What happens when you breed a cow to a bull, you're gonna get what?
[time=1036] A calf, look at that.
[time=1038] That's a little calf born on the raver farm to Joshua's cow, but you breed cattle and you get cattle.
[time=1046] Right?
[time=1048] You breed horses and you get horses.
[time=1053] You breed those things, but it's according to kind.
[time=1057] It's all according to kind.
[time=1059] I wanna give you, we have this up here for a reason today.
[time=1066] We're gonna try to use these things enough so that we can do this.
[time=1069] The phrase is according to kind.
[time=1074] So if I do this,
[time=1084] what is it?
[time=1086] This isn't about my artwork, by the way.
[time=1088] Okay?
[time=1089] This is about the points.
[time=1091] What is that?
[time=1092] - Straight.
[time=1093] - What kind?
[time=1094] Huh?
[time=1098] We don't know.
[time=1101] I submit this to you.
[time=1102] If I pulled this off of it, what would it tell you?
[time=1105] But would I ever get this off of that tree?
[time=1113] If it's an apple tree?
[time=1114] I know this seems simple.
[time=1117] I know this seems simple, but it's an elementary principle in God's kingdom.
[time=1122] It is an elementary principle in God's kingdom.
[time=1126] You get fruit is evidence.
[time=1131] It is.
[time=1140] It tells you it's kind.
[time=1143] And it also tells you how it's going to do the magic thing called reproduce.
[time=1151] Josh Rang told us a couple of weeks ago why it was so important that Nicodemus needed to understand that he needed to do what?
[time=1162] Be, say it again, born again.
[time=1166] Why did Nicodemus need to be born again?
[time=1170] Nicodemus needed to be born again because he had a nature that was a problem.
[time=1175] It was his sin nature.
[time=1177] Romans 5, 19 says for just as though through the disobedience of one man, the many were made sinners.
[time=1185] So also through the obedience of one man, the many were made righteous.
[time=1192] We're made righteous only by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[time=1199] The reason, the reason that we have to be born again is because our flesh is like Nicodemus is was.
[time=1208] Flesh gives birth to what?
[time=1211] Flesh.
[time=1213] Flesh gives birth to flesh.
[time=1214] You get fruit off the tree.
[time=1217] Spirit gives birth to what?
[time=1219] Flesh gives birth to flesh.
[time=1223] Spirit gives birth to spirit.
[time=1225] Our flesh will never produce in our life spiritual things until we've been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[time=1234] That's the transaction that happens, okay?
[time=1238] You don't get to produce spiritual things out of the flesh of Rick.
[time=1243] It doesn't work.
[time=1245] Just like we don't get apples off of an orange tree and oranges off of an apple tree.
[time=1253] You don't get the fruit of Christ manifested in your life until you've been radically changed.
[time=1261] Born again, reborn.
[time=1264] That's what we're getting at.
[time=1266] Without supernatural intervention by the Creator,
[time=1272] this is the design that we are, sinners by nature.
[time=1276] Thanks be to God that there was a plan for intervention and the Holy Spirit is part of it.
[time=1282] Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection makes the transformation possible, okay?
[time=1288] The Holy Spirit is the component that brings us towards
[time=1294] and draws us towards making it happen.
[time=1300] Christ makes it possible, the Holy Spirit draws us
[time=1306] towards making it complete.
[time=1307] So you look at this thing according to your kind.
[time=1312] What does it mean?
[time=1313] What kind is a person?
[time=1316] What does it look like?
[time=1317] What does it look like for the Holy Spirit to be part of this process of us being transformed and changed?
[time=1324] Turn with me to John 16.
[time=1327] John 16, we get to the spot in John 16 verse seven.
[time=1340] I tell you the truth, it is for your good that I go away.
[time=1345] For unless I go away, the comforter, the helper, the advocate, depending on what version you have, unless I go away, the comforter won't come.
[time=1356] Jesus says, just catch that.
[time=1361] It's better for us that he moves on.
[time=1364] For what he does, he says, when he comes,
[time=1370] the counselor, helper, the advocate, the Holy Spirit, he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment.
[time=1380] Verse nine, in regard to sin, because men don't believe in me, in regards to righteousness, because I'm going to the Father where you can't see me anymore.
[time=1393] And in regard to judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.
[time=1399] Satan's lost the battle.
[time=1401] Notice that he's saying these words while Jesus hasn't been to the cross yet.
[time=1406] Satan's already a defeated foe the same of the years for us.
[time=1411] You look at those, they're very descriptive legal terms.
[time=1422] Convict, guilt, judgment, advocate, condemned.
[time=1429] That picture's really clear of a courtroom, okay?
[time=1433] That's what it looks like.
[time=1435] And in that courtroom, it says that the Holy Spirit is going to play the role
[time=1443] to convict in regards to sin, because men don't believe.
[time=1447] His role is characterized if you want to fill in your first fill in the blank and your bulletin.
[time=1453] His role is characterized by being real day to day in your life.
[time=1459] I'll tell you how real he is.
[time=1462] About three weeks ago, I gave Darren and the team where I was going with this outline.
[time=1467] And last Saturday, not yesterday, but a week ago,
[time=1473] I texted Darren and said, "Hey, I woke up all through the night "with the lyrics of a song stuck in my mind." I think maybe God's wanting us to use that for this Sunday morning.
[time=1485] And so I texted him the name of the song.
[time=1488] Guess what Darren's response was?
[time=1489] Rave's already picked it.
[time=1492] Already picked it.
[time=1495] The spirit that's consistent in me is the same one that's consistent in Darren and he's in you and he's going to make this truth real to each of us as we bring it today from his word.
[time=1507] That's what the Holy Spirit does in our day to day life.
[time=1511] I'm going to transition this guy off.
[time=1515] I'm going to draw another picture here.
[time=1517] This concept from John chapter 16, verse nine
[time=1533] is that he convicts the world in regards to sin.
[time=1536] And this big word sin has all kinds of meanings to it,
[time=1545] but it's usually a three letter word that doesn't get talked about a lot in our culture.
[time=1549] And so I want to give you some pictures, real clear word pictures of what this looks like, okay?
[time=1555] The first one is that of a bull's eye, and yes, I do have
[time=1565] something up here this morning.
[time=1568] Don't anybody freak out?
[time=1571] I'm not going to shoot.
[time=1572] All of my boys wanted to line up and show the demonstration that way.
[time=1575] These arrows get launched from the bow.
[time=1580] The truth is that each one of these arrows are just like you and I, they have a personality.
[time=1588] They have a characteristic.
[time=1591] They have a sinful path that leads them to fly consistently the same way.
[time=1600] And so what sin really is, is the flying of this arrow towards the target, but guess what?
[time=1609] What does sin mean?
[time=1610] Say it loud.
[time=1613] We miss the target.
[time=1616] Bam.
[time=1617] And we, bam, miss the target over and over and over.
[time=1627] The Holy Spirit's role in making us aware of sin, okay?
[time=1632] Remember, he says right here, the Holy Spirit's role is to convict the world in regards to sin because men don't believe in me.
[time=1641] The Holy Spirit's role is to make us aware of the gap.
[time=1652] And the target here looks just to be really clear.
[time=1654] This is God's right holy truth.
[time=1659] It's God's way of living.
[time=1664] The truth is the Holy Spirit makes you aware of the gap.
[time=1669] Another quick illustration, as many of you seen this, is this picture of man over here and God over here.
[time=1680] And we'll do a bigger word here.
[time=1683] It's a different word.
[time=1685] The chasm that exists between us and God.
[time=1690] The Holy Spirit's role again is the gap awareness, the chasm awareness to make you aware that there is no way in your own power for you to ever.
[time=1701] Bridge the gap, bridge the chasm, or make yourself hit the mark.
[time=1708] The scripture's really clear.
[time=1712] Romans 3, 23 says all of sin in fall short.
[time=1715] Romans 6, 23 says for the wages of sin and death is death, but the gift of God is eternal life.
[time=1721] They're just saying it was by faith
[time=1728] that I received my sight.
[time=1730] One of the roles of the Holy Spirit is the illuminator.
[time=1734] He's the one that lights up that page and let you at some point understand how big the gap was between you and God's righteous, holy standard.
[time=1745] The truth is, is some of you here this morning?
[time=1749] You may not even understand that.
[time=1751] It may be the first real thing that you've got going on.
[time=1757] He sees, he's opening your eyes, opening your ears so that you get that.
[time=1764] How big the gap is and what does it look like?
[time=1771] The next fill in the blank and your bulletin is, he makes us aware of that sin or that flesh nature.
[time=1778] There's a word that we're gonna come back to and I'll write it up here.
[time=1782] It's called Sarks.
[time=1784] It's kind of a, it's kind of a name.
[time=1789] Sounds pretty cool from the spiritual side of things, but it's Sarks, it's flesh.
[time=1793] At the moment we place our faith in Christ and his death, burial, and resurrection alone to fill the gap, the supernatural intervention of God takes place and the Holy Spirit takes up residence in your life.
[time=1806] He takes up residence in your life and now we have a real spirit-powered life.
[time=1814] That's the next fill in the blank.
[time=1816] We have a real spirit-powered life and our relationship with sin, our relationship with sin is forever changed.
[time=1824] It's forever changed.
[time=1826] It doesn't mean that it's totally gone.
[time=1829] Flip with me to Galatians 5.
[time=1833] We wanna read this passage here.
[time=1835] Galatians 5, remember we're talking about freedom
[time=1841] and slavery and bondage.
[time=1843] Galatians 5, one said it is for freedom that Christ set us free.
[time=1847] Stay and firm.
[time=1848] Do not let yourself be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.
[time=1852] You've been set free.
[time=1854] The chains are broken, they're gone.
[time=1857] The door of this prison cell is open.
[time=1860] Don't sit there like you still have.
[time=1863] Change on like you're locked up.
[time=1868] Jump down to verse 13, Galatians 5, 13.
[time=1873] You, my brothers, were called to be free, but don't use your freedom to do what?
[time=1878] Indulge in the sinful nature.
[time=1882] Huh, Romans 6 says, how shall we that are dead to sin any long, living any longer in it?
[time=1890] God forbid, shall we continue and sin that grace may abound?
[time=1895] No way.
[time=1897] Galatians 5, 16 says this.
[time=1905] So I say, depending on your version, it'll say live or walk by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.
[time=1913] For the sinful nature, Sarks, that's the Sarks word, for the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the spirit and the spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature, they are in conflict with each other, conflict.
[time=1930] That's the first war term that you're gonna hear.
[time=1932] They are in conflict with each other so that you do not do what you want.
[time=1942] Romans 8, I'll give you a hint here.
[time=1945] Stick your name, stick something in Galatians 5 and in Romans 8 because we're gonna flip between there some.
[time=1952] Romans 8, 12 through 13,
[time=1958] therefore brothers, we have an obligation, but it is not to the sinful nature to live according to it, for if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die.
[time=1967] But if by the spirit, you will put to death the misdeeds of the body.
[time=1973] It's only once Christ has changed your life that you have a prayer of putting to death the misdeeds that are happening in your flesh.
[time=1981] At this point, the gavel in the courtroom's been dropped
[time=1990] and we've been declared adopted by Jesus.
[time=1993] Boom, he says he's mine, you're no longer living under condemnation.
[time=2000] Romans 8 once says there is now, therefore, no condemnation for those that are in Christ Jesus.
[time=2006] For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free, free from the law of sin and death.
[time=2014] It's real, it's real.
[time=2020] What does it look like?
[time=2023] He's dethroned, the sin nature has been dethroned, it's been dealt, it's ultimate death blow, and we are no longer captive to the enemy.
[time=2032] We really are free.
[time=2034] But the problem is, is the enemy does not want to give up and you still have within you fleshly desires that you like.
[time=2047] The problem is, is Christ sacrifices put it to death.
[time=2051] The Holy Spirit plays the role of making you aware of your sin.
[time=2056] He plays the role of making you aware of your sin and then his second role is to convict in terms of righteousness.
[time=2067] If you look at 16 verse 9 again, 9 and 10, John 16.
[time=2072] He gives you the opportunity to correct yourself.
[time=2077] Convicting the world regards to righteousness.
[time=2083] I submit to you this morning that one of the reasons that we need the Holy Spirit is because we are so wired to look at the external.
[time=2093] We are so wired to look at everybody around us and because Jesus, the perfect example is gone, I'm going to be too tempted to look at somebody else.
[time=2106] And all of a sudden my standard gets clouded by their sin.
[time=2110] And the reason we need the Holy Spirit is for him.
[time=2114] I'm going to give you another picture here.
[time=2127] He makes us aware of the gap.
[time=2131] I've still got through all the way through that paper
[time=2142] clear into the inside.
[time=2143] We've still got those arrow marks over here.
[time=2145] The first thing he does is convict the world to the understanding that there's a gap.
[time=2151] The second ministry, the Holy Spirit.
[time=2153] And this is only, I want to be really clear.
[time=2155] This is only for those that have placed their trust and faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2163] If you haven't done that, the word's really clear.
[time=2167] If the Spirit of Christ isn't in you, you are not Christ.
[time=2175] Romans 8 says that really clear.
[time=2178] The second ministry is then not just the gap, but the correction.
[time=2188] It's the opportunity for us to be changed.
[time=2193] It's the Holy Spirit that makes you aware because Jesus, the perfect loving example that they could watch was going away.
[time=2205] They needed the Holy Spirit to convict them of righteous standard because Jesus wasn't there anymore.
[time=2212] We need to understand that there's a righteous holy example and the Holy Spirit is the one that gives us the ability to fly right.
[time=2224] See these veins, some calling veins, some calling fletchings?
[time=2228] They bring stability to the arrow.
[time=2232] All of these things on this bow, this peep site right here
[time=2238] that I peep my eye through to look through the site, it's all.
[time=2243] It's all about correction.
[time=2245] It's all about when you launch, and I'm going to launch it.
[time=2251] That when I get in there and I look, it's all about me getting an understanding
[time=2257] of the pattern that this thing's going to do.
[time=2260] And the Holy Spirit is the one that does that in your life so that you understand, "Hey, my bent, my sinful curveball that happens in this arrow all the time
[time=2269] that continues to miss, I need to be aware of." And some of you, that's lying.
[time=2275] Some of you, your sinful bent is deception.
[time=2278] Some of you, your sinful bent is you fill in the blank.
[time=2284] What is it?
[time=2286] The Holy Spirit is the one that makes it real.
[time=2289] He's the one that brings the conviction and helps you, helps you even have a prayer
[time=2295] of hitting that mark.
[time=2298] But you never do in your own thing.
[time=2302] It's because of Christ.
[time=2308] Let's flip to Romans 7.
[time=2313] Romans 7.
[time=2317] You're going to hear our second term here.
[time=2321] Romans 7.22, "For I am my inner being."
[time=2328] Actually, I'm going to read 3rd 21, it's not up there, but I'll read it to you.
[time=2331] So I find this law, this dynamic at work.
[time=2334] When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.
[time=2337] And then we get to verse 22.
[time=2339] For in my inner being, that is in my mind, it's another word, it's that thinking part of you
[time=2345] that's able to receive, it's the thinking part that's able to receive the truth of Christ.
[time=2352] That's what your mind is, my inner being.
[time=2355] For in my inner being, I delight in God's law.
[time=2361] But I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind.
[time=2367] There's that second term, waging war.
[time=2371] Making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members.
[time=2374] And Paul says this, what a wretched man that I am.
[time=2379] Guy wrote more than 50% of the New Testament, wretched man.
[time=2384] What a wretched man that I am, but thanks be, who will rescue me?
[time=2387] You've got to get the right verse there.
[time=2389] Who will rescue me from this body of death?
[time=2392] Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=2395] Then I find in my mind, I am a slave to Sarks, my sinful nature.
[time=2403] I'm a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature, I'm a slave to the law of sin, the flesh.
[time=2410] Here, I've got a war that's happening.
[time=2412] In my mind, I can concentrate on this.
[time=2415] I get this.
[time=2416] God's Spirit makes me aware that I fall short.
[time=2420] It makes me aware that there's a righteous standard, that there's truth to be followed.
[time=2428] Satan is the accuser.
[time=2431] He is the father of lies, and he will tell you lies day in, day out, hour by hour, minute by minute.
[time=2440] 2 Corinthians 10, 5 says, we don't wage war as the 2 Corinthians 10 says, we don't wage war as the world does.
[time=2450] But we set our mind.
[time=2452] We take thoughts captive.
[time=2454] Anything that sets itself up against the knowledge of Christ.
[time=2458] That's that spot that says, hey, wait a second.
[time=2462] I know that I'm supposed to be headed here, but I'm not getting there.
[time=2467] The truth is, is you can't get there apart from the Holy Spirit.
[time=2478] The truth is, is that the paper shows that there's a sinful bent and it lands in the same spot often.
[time=2484] But now, just because I'm aware of the sin and the gap and the Holy Spirit, he corrects me.
[time=2495] Galatians 5-9, if you flip back to Galatians, it says, the deeds of the flesh are obvious.
[time=2504] This is that examination.
[time=2508] 5-19, the acts are the deeds of the sinful nature of obvious and it gives a big list.
[time=2513] Sexual immorality and purity, debauchery, idolatry, rich craft.
[time=2517] That's a pretty big list there all of a sudden.
[time=2519] Then you get to things like hatred, dissension, jealousy, rage, selfish ambition, hello.
[time=2528] Dissension, factions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and I love how Paul always throws that stuff in.
[time=2534] And the like, and the like, but I want you to catch this.
[time=2540] I warn you, Paul says, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=2550] So we have to get back to that fruit scenario.
[time=2554] He says, those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=2559] If you flip back to Romans 8, he does, he says a very similar thing.
[time=2562] He says in Romans 8, 11-14, actually we'll start at 7, I'm just going to go there.
[time=2571] The sinful mind is hostile to God.
[time=2573] It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so.
[time=2578] Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God.
[time=2581] You however are controlled not by the sinful nature, but by the spirit.
[time=2585] If the spirit of God lives in you.
[time=2587] And if anyone does not have the spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.
[time=2597] But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness.
[time=2605] There's an old hymn that says, prone to wander, Lord I feel it.
[time=2612] There's a wandering sense within every one of us.
[time=2618] There is a real war that occurs within each of us.
[time=2622] That's your fill in the blank number two.
[time=2624] The next one is deeds of the flesh are obvious.
[time=2627] Don't be confused that the things that are of Sarks, that are of the flesh are still because of that nature.
[time=2634] Because of that nature that's alive.
[time=2636] It's been put to death, but the problem is it's been put to death, but because we love sin, we still do.
[time=2643] There's part of us.
[time=2644] There's part of you men that like to click on crap that you shouldn't look at.
[time=2651] Women, there's things that you shouldn't open your eyes to or put into your mind.
[time=2657] And that's the equivalent of going over to that which God has put to death and resuscitating it.
[time=2665] Breathe your life back into it and until you put it to death and refuse to go back over there and breathe life back into it,
[time=2673] it will continue to wage war.
[time=2679] You have to want to let it die.
[time=2683] The Holy Spirit's the one that even gives you the desire to kill it.
[time=2688] That's the truth.
[time=2693] This is where we get back to the fruit thing.
[time=2697] The next fill in the blank there is the pattern of life.
[time=2700] The pattern of your life is the evidence of your life source.
[time=2707] See, you don't get to, there's another word in Galatians 5 back up there at the beginning of verse 16.
[time=2716] Verse 17, that you don't do what you want.
[time=2719] See, the fruits of the Spirit that are in verse 22, there's a reason it said they are the fruit of the Spirit and they're not the fruit of Rick.
[time=2729] You can't manufacture them.
[time=2733] When does an apple come on an apple tree?
[time=2740] It's natural.
[time=2742] It's a season.
[time=2743] It blossoms.
[time=2746] It grows and an apple is formed.
[time=2749] In the same way, the fruit of your life is consistent to that which you are connected to.
[time=2757] The fruit of your life is consistent to that where you are getting your life source.
[time=2762] John 15 says, apart from me, abide in me, abide in the vine Jesus, apart from me you can do what?
[time=2771] Nothing.
[time=2774] You can do nothing.
[time=2777] The fruit of the Spirit is exactly that.
[time=2782] So, in the blanks there are, the Holy Spirit provides real power to obey.
[time=2788] He draws us.
[time=2790] He draws us back towards this mark and to confession.
[time=2794] I submit to you one of the most powerful things that we need to be reminded of is the healthy practice of confession.
[time=2804] Confession is acknowledging the gap, the need to change, God drives you standard and where you sit.
[time=2813] That's what it is.
[time=2818] And I submit to you this.
[time=2823] The length of time.
[time=2828] The length of time that it takes you to acknowledge the gap, to acknowledge that you've fallen short before the king of kings and before the throne of Jesus is an indicator of your heart condition.
[time=2844] If you've got a soft, tender heart of flesh, you are going to want to repent and get back to that right fellowship spot.
[time=2851] If you are not, if the Holy Spirit hasn't messed you up and drawn you back to that spot because your heart is so hard, it's that kind of an indicator that you continually unchecked walk away from the Spirit's prompting.
[time=2873] I beg you, don't do that.
[time=2881] It is his ministry in your day-to-day life.
[time=2887] The final point filling the blank is the Holy Spirit produces real fruit that points to Jesus.
[time=2895] I love the fruit says, but the fruit of the Spirit being connected to the Jesus tree produces love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness, kind of self-control, and then he goes to this phrase.
[time=2914] He says, all of these law givers that tell you you've got to keep the list, go get circumcised, go do this, do this, don't do that.
[time=2922] He says, against these things, love, joy, peace, patience, there is no law.
[time=2929] There is no law.
[time=2931] Those things flow out of you because you've got the can't help buts of Jesus.
[time=2939] There is no law to say, you've got to do love 47 times this week.
[time=2944] That's not what it is.
[time=2949] Verse 24 in Galatians 5 says this.
[time=2952] Those who belong to Christ have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires.
[time=2958] James 1 says, we are tempted when we are carried away by our own sinful desires.
[time=2965] We've crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires.
[time=2969] Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.
[time=2976] I don't know how many of you have been in the military or in marching band, but how obvious is it when somebody gets out of step?
[time=2987] It's pretty obvious, isn't it?
[time=2990] It's pretty obvious. Walk by the Spirit 516, walk, and it means walk.
[time=2997] It means being step, it means being cadence, it means being aligned.
[time=3001] Walk by the Spirit and He says you won't fulfill the desires of the flesh.
[time=3008] The Spirit is the one that gives you the opportunity to say yes to the things that you need to say yes to and to say no to the things that you need to say no to.
[time=3016] That's what He does.
[time=3019] So I'm going to ask you today.
[time=3022] I'm going to ask you today on these pages.
[time=3029] Some of you are over here on this page, where this concept of according to its kind and the scripture and those things are just starting to make a little bit of sense.
[time=3044] Some of you are aware of this sin gap. You're aware of the gap.
[time=3049] He's made you clear of it, but you haven't yet placed your faith in Jesus Christ, and He's messing you up.
[time=3055] He's working in your mind and saying you need to do that.
[time=3061] Some of you have already trusted in Christ, but are very much aware of the war and feel like you were just a reminder that you're not a slave to sin, but you need to start practicing, taking the change off and walking out of the jail cell.
[time=3073] Some of you are a Christ follower who's living and acting if there is no war with sin in your life.
[time=3094] You're living and walking and going through the motion, and everything's fine.
[time=3106] 2 Corinthians 12, 9 and 10, "For my power is made perfect in your weakness, therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that Christ's power may dwell on me."
[time=3119] If you're not confessing, if you're not aware, if you're not moving through that, it's a dangerous spot.
[time=3127] And then some of you may be in a season that seems really peaceful, and there's great victory.
[time=3134] Then I would tell you to praise the one who paid your debt and rejoice in it.
[time=3139] Be aware because there's another battle coming.
[time=3144] I want you to be ignorant my brothers when you endure trials of many kinds, okay?
[time=3150] It's coming.
[time=3152] As Darren and the band come back up, I'm going to ask you to consider where you're at here.
[time=3161] To consider where you're at.
[time=3164] I want you to be real about your ugly.
[time=3169] I want you to be honest about what the Holy Spirit is telling you today about where you're at on those charts, okay?
[time=3180] Some of you need to respond to the Holy Spirit today, and some of you need to come down and come down front and have me or one of the elders pray with you.
[time=3196] There's other for you that need to stand up right where you're at and say, "This battle is mine. I'm in it. I'm going to stand here."
[time=3203] Whatever that looks like.
[time=3206] Some of you need to bow your head right now where you're at and deal with whatever the Holy Spirit's doing with you.
[time=3218] Remember, Spirit gives birth to Spirit. He's trying to produce that in your life.
[time=3226] How are you nurturing it? How are you impeding it?
[time=3230] Ask yourself what it looks like.
[time=3234] Is there fruit evidence? Is there fruit evidence of me being connected to the Jesus tree?
[time=3244] If there's not, let's get you connected to the Jesus tree.
[time=3248] If there is, be obedient.
[time=3252] Darren's going to sing this song. We're going to sing this song as you feel led.
[time=3256] Come down front, stand up where you're at, bow where you're at, whatever that looks like.
[time=3261] And when we're done, we'll close.
[time=3265] Go ahead.
[time=3268] Lord, I come. I confess.
[time=3276] I'll be here. I find my rest without you.
[time=3286] I fall above. You're the one that guides my heart.
[time=3298] Sing that with me.
[time=3300] Lord, I need you. Oh, I need you.
[time=3309] Every hour I need you. My wrong defense.
[time=3319] My righteousness. Oh, God, how I leave you.
[time=3332] Where sin runs deep. Your grace is more. Where grace is found.
[time=3343] It's where you are. And where you are. Lord, I am free.
[time=3354] Holiness is Christ in me. Where you are. Lord, I am free.
[time=3368] Holiness is Christ in me.
[time=3378] Lord, I need you. Oh, I need you.
[time=3387] Every hour I need you. My wrong defense. My righteousness.
[time=3400] Oh, God, how I need you. Lord, I need you. Oh, I need you.
[time=3415] Every hour I need you. My wrong defense. My righteousness.
[time=3429] Oh, God, how I need you. My one defense. My righteousness.
[time=3444] Oh, God, how I need you.
[time=3454] Let's have everybody stand. The truth is, that's a great verse right there.
[time=3462] As for me, I am poor and needy, but the Lord takes thoughts for me.
[time=3469] Where my help and my deliverer, some of you stood, some of you didn't stand.
[time=3475] The truth is, as you know, what the Holy Spirit was doing in your own life.
[time=3480] I beg you, I beg you to listen. Don't take it for granted.
[time=3488] It's the way that he corrects you and gets you pointed towards Jesus because the fruit of the Spirit points to Jesus Christ. They are inseparable.
[time=3497] It's the Holy Spirit. Webby said it last week, they are inseparable.
[time=3503] Let me pray for us. Heavenly Father, your word is true. Your word is right.
[time=3511] You're a holy and you demand righteous living.
[time=3519] Thank you, Jesus, that you make the difference in our life that we have a prayer.
[time=3525] Help us to live life differently. Help us to be real and help us to rely on you, Holy Spirit,
[time=3532] for that which only you can do. In Jesus' name.
