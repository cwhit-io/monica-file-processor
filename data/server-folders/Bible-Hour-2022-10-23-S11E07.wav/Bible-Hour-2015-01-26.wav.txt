[time=60] Open the heavens, come living water, all my contents are in you.
[time=84] You're strong like a river.
[time=89] Your love is running through all my contents are in you.
[time=102] [AMEN]
[time=120] Well, good morning everyone.
[time=122] Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=124] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=125] I'm a teaching pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=127] I'm so glad that you're watching this morning and that many of you have been watching for a long, long time.
[time=132] We love that you're part of our family.
[time=133] We love that you get to engage with us in this way.
[time=136] This morning you're going to see us finish up our series in the Holy Spirit, where four of us, my friend Jesse, my friends, Jesse, Josh, Rick and myself,
[time=146] are going to be answering some questions that were submitted to us on the whole series on the Holy Spirit.
[time=151] What's the nature of the gifts the Holy Spirit gives and just defining some terms?
[time=156] I think you're really going to enjoy and benefit from what you hear there.
[time=160] Starting the next week after this one, we're going to be beginning a series called Four Days
[time=166] with using a hashtag, Snapshots of Love.
[time=170] Luke 22, 27 says that Jesus, he validates service, that I am here among you as one who serves.
[time=179] And so what we're going to do throughout the whole series, we're taking 10 weeks ending on Easter Sunday and we're going to take the last four days of Jesus' life from Luke 22 to 24 and really explore the great imagery there of his service,
[time=193] of his great love for us, his selfless service, of course, following with his death and resurrection.
[time=201] So we can't wait to walk you through that much more to come on that.
[time=205] So please join us on this 10-week journey, again ending with Easter Sunday on Snapshots of Love,
[time=211] Four Days, the last four days of Jesus' life.
[time=216] You've been hearing us talk about our service times in recent days.
[time=220] I wanted to let you know about that again.
[time=222] Our first hour is a connecting hour.
[time=224] It's an hour where we have communities all across our campus that are tailored to any number of different kinds of needs.
[time=231] There's children's care provided along the way.
[time=234] We really believe that life change happens best in those circles.
[time=239] Circles not simply instead of rows, but circles and rows.
[time=243] Classes of people, small communities where there's really life on life happening, where we're praying for one another and really going to God for each other's needs.
[time=252] Then 10-30 is our one time of gathering on Sunday morning.
[time=257] We've really appreciated the unity and the energy and the spirit that we've just all been together on Sunday morning.
[time=263] So nine o'clock is our connecting time.
[time=266] It's a community hour where we're together in those smaller settings all across the campus.
[time=270] And 10-30 is our time for gathering right here in the sanctuary, where again we've really seen a great energy and a great spirit in the last few weeks, and we're going to be pursuing that for the foreseeable future.
[time=281] So as you're thinking about coming to join us here on campus, think about those two times, nine o'clock for connecting, and 10-30 for gathering.
[time=290] We also want to make you aware of an opportunity to sponsor the Bible Hour.
[time=296] I mentioned a few moments ago that some of you have been watching for a long time, and this is an opportunity for you to lend support to a program that's meant something to you over the years.
[time=305] Sponships are available for a loved one, for an anniversary, perhaps a birthday.
[time=311] The way that you can do that is on the screen as you can see it there.
[time=314] I would invite you to consider that to lend your support to be a sponsor of the Bible Hour if the show has meant something to you over the years.
[time=322] And we know that it has because you tell us all the time how much it's meant to you.
[time=326] In honor of a loved one, we can show a 20-second spot at the beginning and the end of the program in honor of that loved one, in honor of that anniversary, in honor of that birthday or special occasion.
[time=336] So consider doing that, would you? There's the information on the screen.
[time=340] As we often do, thank you for watching the Bible Hour for being a part of our family in this way.
[time=346] And as we always do, we invite you to come be a part of what we're doing here on campus and to say hello.
[time=352] Thanks for watching.
[time=361] [MUSIC]

[time=582] Amazing love, how can it be that you, my King, would die for me.
[time=597] Amazing love, I know it's true. It's my joy to honor you.
[time=610] Amazing love, how can it be that you, my King, would die for me.
[time=626] Amazing love, I know it's true. It's my joy to honor you, in all I do.
[time=642] I honor you, in all I do. I honor you.
[time=656] Amen, you may be seated.
[time=671] Who is like you, Lord, in all the earth. Matchless love and beauty endless work.
[time=685] Nothing in this world can satisfy.
[time=692] Jesus, you're the cup that won't run dry. Your presence is heaven to me.
[time=713] Your presence is heaven to me.
[time=727] Treasure of my heart and of my soul. In my weakness you are merciful.
[time=741] The deamer of my past, a present from, an holder of my future days to come.
[time=755] Your presence is heaven to me.
[time=782] So sing in, O Jesus, O Jesus.
[time=794] Your presence is heaven to me.
[time=798] O Jesus, O Jesus.
[time=808] Your presence is heaven to me.
[time=819] So all my days on earth I will await.
[time=826] The moment that I see you face to face. But nothing in this world can satisfy.
[time=841] Jesus, you're the cup that won't run dry.
[time=858] Your presence is heaven to me.
[time=914] So sing in, O Jesus, O Jesus.
[time=926] Your presence is heaven to me.
[time=930] O Jesus, O Jesus.
[time=940] Your presence is heaven to me.
[time=954] [AMEN] This morning we are in our Holy Spirit series.
[time=962] This is rethink where we've taken some questions from you guys and also some questions that we generate that we feel like are questions that we get sometimes about the Holy Spirit.
[time=972] And so we're just going to work through a few of those this morning and see what we have time for.
[time=976] And hopefully we'll answer your question.
[time=979] And if it doesn't get answered, email Webby and he'll take care of that.
[time=982] Yeah, that's right.
[time=984] Actually one of the things that we are going to do during the first hour, during the first hour community time next week, stuff that doesn't get answered here.
[time=995] You have other questions that you want to get answered.
[time=997] Please feel free to join us right in here back in that section back there for the dialogue, the dialogue class and we will continue to answer some of these over the next few weeks for stuff that doesn't get answered.
[time=1009] And second exposure.
[time=1014] Double exposure does that in a little bit different way.
[time=1018] We're going to be specifically addressing some of the questions that don't get out.
[time=1021] But yeah, double exposure with Steve Long.
[time=1023] Steve, not Steve.
[time=1024] Arlen Friesen and Mr. Gardner down there.
[time=1029] Steve Gardner.
[time=1030] All right.
[time=1031] Got that.
[time=1032] Okay, we'll figure that out.
[time=1033] Let's get to the questions.
[time=1034] Got it.
[time=1040] I think so.
[time=1042] The question was, is it okay to pray to the Holy Spirit?
[time=1044] Do I pray to Jesus?
[time=1046] Do I pray to God the Father?
[time=1048] Do I pray to the Holy Spirit?
[time=1051] Talking with these guys this week, we took great comfort from a passage like you find in Romans 8 where we don't know, we talked about this before, we don't know how to pray as we should.
[time=1063] So the Holy Spirit actually intercepts my weirdo prayers and carries them off to God and makes them say what they should say.
[time=1072] So in other words, you can't do it wrong.
[time=1074] Rod Ovid said to me on Thursday morning, he's like, if you're praying to God the Father or the Son of the Holy Spirit, and somehow that's not the way it should be, then God in the Trinity is like, well, he really means you.
[time=1086] You know, the Son says the Spirit, well he really means you, so the Spirit does that, he runs interference for our messed up, weak, incomplete prayers.
[time=1096] I did take some comfort also from the prayer that Jesus taught his disciples, our Father, who's in heaven.
[time=1103] I don't know if there's anything wrong with praying.
[time=1105] I know if I heard Rick pray, and in his prayer he said, Holy Spirit, please come and be with us today.
[time=1113] Not no red flags would go off for me.
[time=1117] I want to be really careful about making daylight between any of the persons of the Trinity.
[time=1122] They're all very much God.
[time=1125] Different agencies, Rick will get to that more next week in his class, you can come talk to him about that next week, but the three members of the Trinity have different agency, but praying to each one, I wouldn't be really nervous about that, generally speaking.
[time=1138] It may even come down to just the context of your prayer, potentially.
[time=1145] Obviously the Father, the Son, the Spirit, they're co-eternal, co-substantial, co-equal, there's no difference between them, and yet they each have different jobs as you will.
[time=1158] And so your example of Rick saying, "Oh Spirit, would you come be with us?"
[time=1164] He is there, the filling of him is something that we can pray for, so then we could address him specifically.
[time=1172] So depending upon the context or what exactly it is that's on your heart, you could address either one of the three.
[time=1181] I would give you a specific example. When I sit down to this, I pray to the Holy Spirit because he's the illuminator.
[time=1188] He's the one that makes this make sense. He takes my eyes and my mind and helps me get it.
[time=1194] So I pray, Holy Spirit, please make this make sense.
[time=1199] That's what he's called to do.
[time=1201] And Paul says in Ephesians 6 to pray all times in the Spirit.
[time=1205] So I really don't think you can mess it up. Romans 8, I take a lot of comfort from that. The pressure really is off because we don't pray as we ought.
[time=1213] And God knows that and knows my weakness.
[time=1215] And that Romans 8 even says, "When you don't even know the right words to say." I mean, he knows what's on your heart in such an amazing way.
[time=1224] It's just God's grace again to us. He's such an amazing Father that he would be able to even take the groanings of our heart
[time=1233] and just put words to them to go to the Father.
[time=1236] It's really an amazing gift that God's Spirit would do that for us.
[time=1240] Good stuff. Let's keep moving. Let's keep moving.
[time=1243] Why do the sign gifts get elevated?
[time=1247] Just to be really clear, we'll put a little bit of definition about what the sign gifts are.
[time=1251] Those are typically the ones that are the miracles and healing and the tongues, speaking in tongues and interpretation and prophecy.
[time=1262] Specifically in this question about elevation.
[time=1266] Elevation is one thing that I would tell you, it gets to the core of the human psyche.
[time=1272] All the way back to the spot that we elevate preachers, we elevate teachers, we elevate people that get up front.
[time=1279] Even to the spot that in 1 Samuel, when David was getting selected king, when David was getting selected king
[time=1286] and seven brothers got brought before Samuel. God says, I look at the heart, I don't look at the outside.
[time=1297] The same thing that happens, it's very, very common in our structure.
[time=1301] Paul is really, really clear. Paul was really clear in 1 Corinthians 12.
[time=1306] I can't say to the hand, I don't need you nor to the head, no feet, I have no need of you.
[time=1311] On the contrary, the parts of the body that seemed weaker are indispensable.
[time=1317] Those parts of the body that we think are less honor, we bestow greater honor.
[time=1324] In our unpresentable parts, we treat with greater modesty, which is a bigger deal when we look at that.
[time=1333] But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it, that there may be no division
[time=1340] and that the member of body may all have the same care for one another.
[time=1344] And then it says in verse 17, just real clear if you look at 1 Corinthians 12, 17.
[time=1350] But if the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be?
[time=1358] And then he goes on at the end of the chapter and he even says, and I love the way the guy in the message says it,
[time=1364] if we were all one unidimensional body, we're not.
[time=1369] He says, are we all eyes? Are we all hands? Are we all apostles? Are we all prophets?
[time=1375] And rhetorically, it's really clear, it's no. It's no. We're not any of that.
[time=1380] Or what would the body of Christ look like as a one-eyed cyclops? That's not what we are.
[time=1386] There is diversity given for the common good as we look at that.
[time=1390] So the elevation component is all about us as humans elevating things that we elevate all the time,
[time=1397] from the guys that are up here to people that you can see and tans will be touched and feel sometimes.
[time=1403] Interesting, 1 Corinthians 12, which you were at.
[time=1405] If you remember back to 1 Corinthians 12 is a passage that I spoke on several weeks ago.
[time=1412] But the emphasis there isn't necessarily on the gifts that are given to the individual.
[time=1417] The emphasis upon the spirit who gives the gifts and the activity and the function of the spirit in our hearts and in our lives.
[time=1425] And so the attention goes back to the spirit rather than to us.
[time=1429] And the spirit's distribution of the gifts to the body, 1 Corinthians 12, 7 I believe, for the common good of the body of Christ, edification building up.
[time=1439] But my nephew Jack is how old, Jody, he's five, he has type 1 diabetes, his pancreas doesn't work.
[time=1447] He has to have insulin or he will die.
[time=1450] And so I don't think of my pancreas ever.
[time=1453] But his mom, Kinsey, thinks about it every day, all the time when it's not working right.
[time=1458] So even the parts that are less desirable or less, you know, that we don't see or think of it very often, they're essential.
[time=1464] And the body analogy I think is why Paul used it, it's very effective.
[time=1468] Well, and one of the other things, I'll just say it really clearly.
[time=1471] He even goes on and ends chapter 12 with 13, 12, 31, and he said no matter the gift,
[time=1479] and he says I'm going to show you the most excellent way, that no matter the gift, if anything but other centered agape, Christlike love, is the foundation for a gift being manifested,
[time=1492] it's going to be noisy, it's going to be ineffective, it's going to be a clanging symbol, it's going to be, and if the foundation isn't love, then you've already missed the mark of any of the gifts that are talking about.
[time=1504] Yeah, it's good.
[time=1505] So the main point there is why elevate anything except for the Holy Spirit, Christ, you know,
[time=1513] elevate him, the emphasis upon Christ's body and him not on the gifts and how they function.
[time=1520] Does that be fair to say?
[time=1521] Yep.
[time=1522] I don't think mine's on.
[time=1524] Jesse's not on?
[time=1525] Don't think I'm on.
[time=1526] I'm on.
[time=1527] There you go.
[time=1528] Also from the first question, we want to, at the end of the day, pray.
[time=1530] You know, if we're not sure it's Holy 5 or something, pray, can't go wrong there, right?
[time=1534] Football, if you don't know the play, just hit somebody, can't go wrong, right?
[time=1538] And this is love, love, love.
[time=1541] Okay, let's move on, let's keep going.
[time=1543] Yeah, I think it's me.
[time=1544] What is the baptism of the Holy Spirit?
[time=1547] And one thing I would say really quickly is a lot of these things that we talked about this morning, there may be other godly people who have different interpretations of that.
[time=1555] And we have done our best to pray before the Lord and to ask the Holy Spirit to illuminate
[time=1561] our hearts to understand what truth is.
[time=1564] At the end of the day, you know, we come back to again that common confession that we talked about in 1 Timothy, that Jesus is the pillar of truth, the buttress of truth.
[time=1576] So this common, you know, commonality within the faith is that we all believe Jesus is
[time=1582] the Son of God who died and rose again and is the Savior.
[time=1585] And then outside of that, there are, you know, just issues that are certainly important.
[time=1591] However, we can be open to let other people have some different interpretations of that.
[time=1595] That doesn't mean that I'm not going to be passionate about what I believe it says, but
[time=1601] I certainly can be open to what other people would say on that verse.
[time=1606] This is an interesting topic.
[time=1607] There's a, you know, different people in Christianity that would say that there is a second filling
[time=1614] or there is more of the Holy Spirit that you need as you go along in the Christian life.
[time=1621] And that baptism of the Holy Spirit is when you reach certain levels or plateaus of walking
[time=1627] with Christ, then there is almost more of the Holy Spirit that you can receive.
[time=1632] And that more of the Holy Spirit allows you to do sometimes some of those, you know, miracle gifts or some of that, the tongues or those type of things.
[time=1641] I believe baptism of the Spirit in Scripture really is clear and it's, it's simultaneous with, with salvation.
[time=1648] You receive 100% of the Holy Spirit when God in, in the way that He does that when He renews
[time=1656] your heart and saves you by the work of Christ.
[time=1661] There is that baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1664] So John said of Jesus that there is one coming, he's, John the Baptist said, I baptize you
[time=1672] with water, but there's somebody who's coming who will baptize you with the Spirit.
[time=1677] And then we see in Acts two, there is this, you know, coming of the Spirit as the Holy Spirit now comes and now indwells individual believers in a different way than He did in the Old Testament.
[time=1690] And so now in 1 Corinthians 12, it says that we are all baptized into one, one body through
[time=1697] the Spirit.
[time=1698] So it's just this idea that, that baptism of the Spirit is a, a simultaneous act at
[time=1704] our salvation.
[time=1706] And it's interesting to note that nowhere does it say that the Holy Spirit baptizes, but Christ baptizes us into His body and He uses the Spirit to do that.
[time=1716] So just to be clear on our front, it really is something that is done by God at the moment
[time=1724] of salvation that now you have as a follower of Christ, one redeemed by the blood of Christ,
[time=1732] 100% of the Holy Spirit living and dwelling inside of you.
[time=1737] Yeah.
[time=1738] Ephesians one says, in Him you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, when you heard the gospel of your salvation, who was the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquired possession of it to the praise of His glory.
[time=1749] So we received that at the, when we believed in Him and Him, the Him there in verse 13 is Christ from verse 12.
[time=1755] Yeah.
[time=1756] It's really good.
[time=1757] Yeah.
[time=1759] Nice job.
[time=1760] Great.
[time=1761] Let's keep going.
[time=1762] Next, let's go.
[time=1763] I believe this one was on my list.
[time=1764] I think if you have the Spirit is living in me, why do I still sin?
[time=1768] Great question.
[time=1770] This is such a good question.
[time=1771] And I think, you know, as you were talking about at the moment of salvation, we are changed, the Holy Spirit comes and resides in us, lives in us, but at the same time, we still have these desires.
[time=1781] Romans 7 talks about this battle that we, things we want to do, we don't always do, things we don't want to do, we do sometimes.
[time=1787] And I look at it like this.
[time=1788] If you were to put two tables up here on the stage and you fill them with food, okay?
[time=1793] One side is like really healthy, awesome, delicious food.
[time=1797] The other side is kind of nasty, really spoiled food.
[time=1802] Before Christ, the only table you could choose from was the spoiled food.
[time=1806] Once you have Jesus, now you have the ability to choose from both, right?
[time=1811] The whole, the sin hasn't been eradicated.
[time=1813] That comes when Jesus comes back.
[time=1815] But now you have the ability to choose healthy, healthy good righteousness or unrighteousness.
[time=1821] That's what the Spirit does.
[time=1822] It doesn't eradicate it.
[time=1823] So that's why there's this battle waging in us because sin's effect on us is so powerful
[time=1829] from the very beginning.
[time=1830] So I like to look at it with food because I like food, it helps you remember.
[time=1834] I have two choices.
[time=1835] Now I have that ability to make that choice.
[time=1837] Before Christ, I could only choose unrighteousness.
[time=1840] Now that Christ has renewed me and redeemed me, I can choose unrighteousness and sin or I can choose righteousness and follow His way, which is best.
[time=1848] That's kind of that trust and obey kind of thing going on there.
[time=1851] That's how I look at it.
[time=1852] That helps me.
[time=1853] I've always heard, this is a funny one, but sin just makes you stupid.
[time=1859] So that's part of the answer to that, because really as I just follow after my flesh, it's
[time=1866] just stupidity when you come down to it.
[time=1869] Because God is offering us life and then we also have this other choice that anywhere
[time=1875] sin is described in Scripture, it's always derogatory, it's death, it's destruction, it's consequences and we go on and on.
[time=1883] So it's that type of thing.
[time=1885] And then the other cool thing is Romans 6 says that the body of sin or our flesh has been done away with, that Greek word means rendered powerless, so it's almost like the electrical plug has been pulled out so that we don't have to sin anymore.
[time=1899] The body of sin, our flesh, has been rendered powerless by the work of Christ in our hearts.
[time=1906] We just, again, we still have that effects of our nature that we just go back to way
[time=1913] too often.
[time=1914] Darren, your presence is heaven to me.
[time=1918] It's already but not yet.
[time=1919] We have Jesus right now and we have this remarkable heavenly new creation reality within us.
[time=1925] We long for the new creation when all heavens and the earth are remade, so we live in that tension between new creations already happen, but it will happen at some point when he comes
[time=1936] in the clouds like we were saying earlier.
[time=1937] And there will be a day when that's not true.
[time=1941] That's right.
[time=1942] Praise God.
[time=1943] When we are glorified, there will be no sin and God will just do a completely amazing work that we won't have to struggle even with temptation for that.
[time=1951] No pain in tears.
[time=1952] Yeah.
[time=1953] Well, and it's that end of chapter eight in Romans where he says, he says that nothing
[time=1959] can separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus, and that is the truth.
[time=1965] It's famine, sword, but those who calls, he justifies, those he justified, he's going to glorify.
[time=1972] He's going to produce that work in you by his Holy Spirit.
[time=1975] And there is no condemnation for those that are in Christ.
[time=1979] Nothing can separate us from the love of God, which in Christ, Jesus, all of the big long list.
[time=1984] Yeah.
[time=1985] And then he says, nor anything else in all creation.
[time=1987] Yeah.
[time=1988] And to the answer here too, the reality that we haven't talked about is that Satan is alive
[time=1994] and active.
[time=1996] Yeah.
[time=1997] And he really does masquerade as an angel of light.
[time=2000] And so while God is offering us life, we buy the lie that this other thing looks so good
[time=2007] and will give us what we think we want.
[time=2011] But in the end, it's just death and warm wood and destruction.
[time=2015] And so there is a reality of, for now, Satan kind of roaming and can sometimes have his
[time=2022] way.
[time=2023] James 1 says, "Each one of us is dragged away and enticed by our own evil desires."
[time=2031] And that is a real thing about temptation.
[time=2034] Your Galatians 5, walk by the Spirit and you won't gratify the desires of this sinful
[time=2041] nature.
[time=2042] You have within you this desire to gratify.
[time=2049] And that's where it gets sideways as you continue to desire and to gratify and guess what?
[time=2053] You go gratify and you like it.
[time=2056] Yeah.
[time=2057] I love that the battle in Romans 7 is this tension of, "I want to do this," and then you blow it.
[time=2062] But then that chapter 8, there is no time for you to do this.
[time=2065] Jesus still loves.
[time=2066] Awesome.
[time=2067] You know, don't give up.
[time=2068] Don't quit.
[time=2069] If you blow your diet on January 1st, pick it up on January 2nd.
[time=2072] You know, don't quit.
[time=2073] It's okay.
[time=2074] All right.
[time=2075] Let's go to the next.
[time=2078] What is the nature of the power of the Holy Spirit?
[time=2080] How is it different than the cultural idea of supernatural power?
[time=2085] Had to kind of get behind this question a little bit.
[time=2088] And two things came to mind as we talked about it.
[time=2093] One is that the Holy Spirit is a person.
[time=2096] The Holy Spirit is a person.
[time=2097] He's not an it.
[time=2098] He's not a George Lucas, you know, force and the energy and the universe is a person.
[time=2104] And so he comes with this power that is personal.
[time=2107] He comes as a person with power to bear witness of a person.
[time=2113] Jesus goes back.
[time=2114] This is a good review of our series on the Holy Spirit that he comes to bear witness of Jesus.
[time=2120] That's why he comes to only speak what he is directed to speak.
[time=2124] That's one thing.
[time=2125] It's personal power and John 14, 15 and 16 really talks about that.
[time=2129] The second thing that Rod Ovid was also helpful, again, is that maybe the cultural idea of supernatural power is kind of explosive and, you know, it's spectacular.
[time=2139] But to Josh's passage from John 3 in the rebirth week of the series, the wind blows
[time=2147] where it wills, Jesus says, and so does the spirit.
[time=2150] So he's effective, but you may not be able to see it.
[time=2153] So Rod was talking with us in recent days about the spirit's power is effective, but
[time=2159] perhaps not spectacular in the way that maybe culture expects it to be.
[time=2164] I had been very careful to never put the Holy Spirit on Elise.
[time=2168] You can do whatever he wants to do.
[time=2170] I believe that.
[time=2171] But at the same token, I want to take the words of Scripture as my guide, as my, as,
[time=2177] you know, hemming me in to say the Holy Spirit's power in our lives, in this community of faith all over the world is effective to do exactly what he needs to be done in a step of the way.
[time=2188] So it's much less, perhaps, spectacular and more on the ground like the wind.
[time=2193] The wind blows where it wills and you don't know where it's going to come from, where it goes.
[time=2197] That's the way it is with the spirit.
[time=2198] He's effective.
[time=2199] He's constant.
[time=2201] Not so much this.
[time=2202] Yeah, Rod even said, you know, when Paul wrote this stuff, dynamite didn't exist, but the concept of power that was like that is one of the words.
[time=2211] The other one is, is the one where we get an ongoing, effectual power that's the spinning
[time=2219] of another word that we get.
[time=2222] And so when we think about that, it is ongoing, it's continuous, and it never goes away.
[time=2230] And it doesn't always have this big explosion dynamite kind of a thing, but it does always,
[time=2238] always, have power.
[time=2240] Yeah.
[time=2241] So you receive power, acts one eight when the Holy Spirit comes upon you.
[time=2244] That's real power, and it affected disciples' witness in the world, and it was, and that was spectacular.
[time=2250] His power was real, residing within them.
[time=2253] So let's not minimize that either.
[time=2255] That's good.
[time=2256] Yeah.
[time=2257] Well said.
[time=2258] Next one.
[time=2259] Let's keep moving.
[time=2260] That's good.
[time=2261] What does it mean to desire the greater gifts?
[time=2263] Actually, this question has its origin.
[time=2265] If you flip to your Bible, the 1 Corinthians 1231, I want to be really clear.
[time=2271] There is even among Greek scholars.
[time=2275] This word that's in the front of this that says be eager or literally, it's the word
[time=2281] that could be translated zealots, okay?
[time=2284] And there's two ways that it's translated.
[time=2286] One way is it's translated that you are, it's an imperative, it's a command.
[time=2292] You are to be eager for a gift.
[time=2296] The other way that it could be translated is it's indicative.
[time=2300] And it's indicative in a way that says you are being eager for greater gifts, being they're
[time=2307] pursuing this in a way.
[time=2310] And so what that looks like, again, where Josh said earlier, there are people that may disagree with us on where this lands.
[time=2317] But the truth is, is there is some room there for both of those to occur.
[time=2323] But you can't miss at the end of 1231.
[time=2326] And as soon as he says, greater gifts, he makes a qualifying statement of transition.
[time=2333] Greater?
[time=2334] Now it's excellent.
[time=2335] We're going from greater to the most excellent way.
[time=2338] And just for the record, 1 Corinthians 13 is not about marriage.
[time=2343] It's not the marriage love chapter, it's the chapter about gifts being used in the most
[time=2350] excellent way under the foundation of love, okay?
[time=2354] And when you look at that, it's really, really clear.
[time=2359] That foundation of love, as I already said, it doesn't matter.
[time=2363] It doesn't, if you do it without love, it's going to be ineffective.
[time=2367] That's Paul's point.
[time=2368] Clanging symbol.
[time=2369] The other thing that often comes along with this verse is 1 Corinthians 14 chapter 1.
[time=2374] Often, if you flip it over a page, this is right after he says, qualifier, love is the
[time=2380] big deal.
[time=2382] He starts chapter 14 verse 1 with pursue love, pursue agape, and then some of you will have
[time=2389] a verse there in your thing in the middle of the verse.
[time=2392] It'll say, earnestly desire the spiritual gift and gift is an italics.
[time=2398] And I want to tell you why the gift is an italics.
[time=2401] It's because gift doesn't exist there.
[time=2404] The word that's translated in 1231 means gift, I want to make it matter, pursue spiritual
[time=2413] gifts, eagerly desire, that's what it is.
[time=2416] On that spot, Charismata, in chapter 14 verse 1, it says, eagerly desire, pneumatica, pneumatica,
[time=2427] it's not, there's no word gift there at all.
[time=2431] Immediately translated, it would say, pursue agape, pursue love, earnestly desire, be zealous
[time=2439] for spiritual, but most of all prophesy, and we're going to get to that in a minute.
[time=2448] But most of all prophesy, which is, as we'll tell you in a few minutes, break forth the truth, forth telling in a timely manner of God's Word in a way that builds up the body.
[time=2460] And don't think that that passage right there has the word gift in it because it doesn't.
[time=2465] It's pneumatica, it does not Charismata, totally different, and it's a misunderstanding.
[time=2471] Charismata, clearly spiritual gifts, pneumatica, in 1431, the gift's Word isn't there, it's
[time=2477] simply implied in some of those translations.
[time=2480] It's literally what happens in translation is the same thing that happens often.
[time=2485] People translate with an exegetical type of, with input, interpretation itself.
[time=2494] And the truth is, is that one, the words don't even, they're not even.
[time=2497] So you would say, what does it mean the earth's desire, the greater gifts, should be alternately translated.
[time=2503] You are desiring the greater gifts, but there's an even better way than that.
[time=2506] Yeah.
[time=2507] The love is the key.
[time=2508] Especially when you read 1 Corinthians 12, they've got it sideways, they're pursuing gifts that don't matter, they're emphasizing ones, they're elevating others.
[time=2517] And he says, but you're earnestly desiring the gift, stop, I'm going to show you a more excellent way.
[time=2523] Love.
[time=2524] Love, agape, and then in 1431, he says, pursue agape, be eager for spiritual things, but
[time=2533] most of all, bring forth the truth of God in a timely manner to make it apply and build
[time=2539] up the body.
[time=2540] It's awful.
[time=2542] Not real quick.
[time=2543] So you might be thinking there and sitting there and wondering, well, how am I supposed to know that, right?
[time=2550] Because you pick up your Bible and it says spiritual gifts there.
[time=2557] And so just a quick thought here is there's tons of Bible software out there that you
[time=2563] can purchase that would be a help to you.
[time=2565] You don't have to take Greek.
[time=2567] There are plenty of studies out there that allow you to do that.
[time=2571] One of my favorite sites though is blueletterbible.org.
[time=2575] And that website is a website that is very easy to use.
[time=2580] And you can go to the verse that you're looking at and it will very clearly show you what the Greek word is and then describe that word for you.
[time=2589] So again, you don't have to take three years of Greek like I did back in seminary, but you
[time=2597] can have some help with those type of things.
[time=2601] So you know.
[time=2602] And the only thing that we would foundationally say in addition to that is make sure that if you're going to make a strong stand on something, like Josh said, where there's room where people might believe slightly different as to what that says, be careful of how strong
[time=2619] you make it, especially when there are spots like that that exist.
[time=2624] That's good.
[time=2625] All right.
[time=2626] Let's keep going.
[time=2627] Good job.
[time=2628] Yeah.
[time=2629] How do I quench the Holy Spirit?
[time=2631] What does it mean in Scripture when it says not to quench or put the spirits fire out?
[time=2634] It's really in 1 Thessalonians 5, 19.
[time=2637] I just quick couple thoughts on that.
[time=2639] Number one is when you quench the spirit, the spirit isn't going anywhere.
[time=2643] It's not like you lose the spirit, but that word quench just simply means to stifle.
[time=2649] It means to kind of muffle his again, when we go back to what the spirit does in our hearts
[time=2655] as a believer, that he convicts us right of our sin, that he illuminates, that he points us toward Jesus.
[time=2662] I believe that there are promptings to obey God's word in specific ways.
[time=2668] But when we say no to him, and when we do that on a regular basis, it's in essence of
[time=2674] us just kind of stifling his voice so that it's not as clear so that we don't, yes.
[time=2681] Thank you, Steve, so that we don't hear him as easily, and the issue isn't on his side.
[time=2687] The issue in that realm is on our side in that we are choosing to listen to other things
[time=2693] beside the spirit.
[time=2695] And so that's what I believe that idea of quenching the spirit means to stifle his voice, to not listen.
[time=2702] And as you do that continually, it becomes less and less, and it's just a scary thing
[time=2708] because, again, God's grace to us is that he's given us his spirit so that we would know how to obey and to walk in the good of what God has accomplished for us.
[time=2716] Keep in step with the spirit, same thing.
[time=2718] We can get out of step with him.
[time=2720] That's a dangerous place to be.
[time=2722] Yeah.
[time=2723] Well, once it's indicative of the heart, the quenching of the spirit results in a heart that continues to get calloused, that continues to be hardened, and the spirit is the one that brings tenderness and softness to that, the farther you drift, if you will, from
[time=2739] the mark of the guy leading the march, not walking in line, both of those are very, very beautiful.
[time=2745] Yeah, it's almost as if when you were younger and you started not listening to your mom and dad, and then that just never happened to you.
[time=2752] Never happened to you.
[time=2753] It did for me.
[time=2754] Yeah.
[time=2755] And the longer that that went, right, the more hardness of your heart toward your parents
[time=2761] became.
[time=2762] It's that type of idea.
[time=2765] I know what you're talking about.
[time=2766] And the next question is, how do we practice walking the spirit?
[time=2770] It's the next question.
[time=2771] And what you guys are saying is a quick story.
[time=2773] When I was seven, eight, nine, I was cutting wood with my grandfather, and we were cutting on the pond, and so we were cutting the trees out of the pond, and we were walking it back to put into the trailer, the woodside, carry these big logs.
[time=2786] And so he had steps you could see where his path was, and I decided to take a shortcut and went right through.
[time=2793] With a log in my hand, luckily it was only to hear, I was going to be dead.
[time=2796] And so if I would have just stayed in his path, I'd have been safe.
[time=2802] And so that's kind of what you guys are talking about, in step with the spirit, walking in the spirit, very churchy words, but for me, it's like I think of that, those steps that if I would have just followed grandpa, I'd have been safe.
[time=2811] And so as we kind of think about the spirit, Ezekiel says, you know, a new heart I will give you, a new spirit I will put within you, I'll put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes, you know, the scriptures are there.
[time=2823] And I think, so number one, we want to acknowledge that God and the spirit is there, right?
[time=2827] He's there.
[time=2828] It's just sitting out.
[time=2829] It's not like he comes and goes, he's always there, right?
[time=2832] He's always there too.
[time=2833] We just pray and ask him to empower us.
[time=2836] Maybe it's before a business meeting.
[time=2837] Maybe it's for, you know, when you're getting ready to get up in the morning, you say, "Holy Spirit, I need you today." However, that might look.
[time=2843] And then the third thing is just to trust that he is there, that he does care, and that he will lead you if you will just listen and acknowledge that his presence is with you wherever you go.
[time=2853] That's what I said.
[time=2854] Yeah.
[time=2855] You know, that idea of just listening.
[time=2856] Yeah.
[time=2857] I think one of the biggest issues is just when he convicts of sin.
[time=2861] I know there are times in my life when I know that he's telling me that, you know what, you're wrong in this situation.
[time=2867] You are sinning.
[time=2868] You're going your own way.
[time=2870] And there are times when I don't want to accept that.
[time=2874] And there are times when I just want to stay there for a little bit, right?
[time=2878] If I'm walking with the Spirit, I'm accepting his conviction quickly, and I'm making that
[time=2885] right and going and confessing that sin and reconciling with my brother or sister whoever
[time=2891] it is that I might have sinned against.
[time=2894] So that type of idea where, man, I'm listening to him and acting quickly based upon his conviction
[time=2902] and his promptings and him pointing me back to Jesus into the Word.
[time=2905] I'll give you a practical illustration.
[time=2909] You can...
[time=2910] I'll give them two of you.
[time=2911] One is the man in front of the football game with the remote control, okay?
[time=2918] And how easily he's focused and his wife is saying something and he's not hearing very
[time=2924] well.
[time=2925] The other is your teenager while they're texting and they say that they hear you.
[time=2934] They may hear, but they may not be listening very well.
[time=2938] Does it make sense?
[time=2940] Yeah.
[time=2942] So if you're walking...
[time=2944] That first one may be a gift.
[time=2945] Yeah.
[time=2946] Just kidding.
[time=2947] So walking by the Spirit in that instance is putting, turning off the TV and putting down
[time=2953] the phone and listening attentively.
[time=2957] That one I do.
[time=2958] Act it.
[time=2962] Put yourself in a posture in a position to have it hit your ears and make sense and not be diluted.
[time=2966] Yeah.
[time=2967] All right.
[time=2968] Let's move on.
[time=2969] I'll just...
[time=2970] It's a quick round.
[time=2971] Yes, right.
[time=2972] That's right.
[time=2973] Lightning, right.
[time=2974] That's right.
[time=2975] Lightning, right.
[time=2976] I'll just...
[time=2977] So quick definition here.
[time=2978] And you can define it in different ways, speaking in tongues, works of healing, prophecy
[time=2987] as defined by...
[time=2988] This is what God says, something different from this.
[time=2992] They believe that those gifts were done during the age of Christ and the apostles.
[time=2997] They have...
[time=2998] Sessation means that they've ceased, but that's what a cessationist believes.
[time=3002] And just real quick too.
[time=3003] Yeah.
[time=3004] Whenever you're calling somebody something, there's lots of different views of cessation ism.
[time=3009] And so just because someone says they're a cessationist or you put that on them, understand there might be some different veins, there might be some different paths of that, just like we look at, you know, Presbyterian.
[time=3021] There's different types of Presbyterian.
[time=3023] Lutheran.
[time=3026] So just be careful that you're not putting everyone into one, you know, what you think that means.
[time=3032] But take some time to get to know them and understand what they believe and why they believe in those type of things.
[time=3036] And where the response, where the response, that there are that level of variance and understanding
[time=3044] about different people.
[time=3045] Be careful how problematic they are without that saying you have to be careful about that.
[time=3053] What are your thoughts about the gifts of healing tongues prophecy?
[time=3058] As we talk about it, the healing is the kind of thing where Peter and John and they met a lame man and they said, "Take up your bed and walk." The tongues is that where they were speaking languages that the speaker didn't know.
[time=3072] There is among our belief here and many that that was a language.
[time=3077] It was not some kind of an ecstatic utterance.
[time=3079] It was in Corinthians, by the way, there was common belief that we were over 28 languages
[time=3085] that would show up at a given meeting or anything like that.
[time=3088] And so imagine coming in and you being one of the 28 languages that the guy wasn't speaking
[time=3094] from the podium and he's preaching.
[time=3097] So you needed somebody to speak the language or hear to do that in a way that made sense for the common people.
[time=3103] And so they did that.
[time=3104] What those look like, what we would say in one of those things is they are not normative
[time=3111] in their distribution of the body today.
[time=3114] If being that you see him all over the place and what does that look like if it were really that part of it.
[time=3121] Specifically to prophecy.
[time=3123] We've actually worked on some definition here and I'm going to just read some of the things that we came together as a group of elders.
[time=3129] It is the ability given by the Holy Spirit to bring the revealed biblical foundational truths of God to bear in a timely manner for the one or ones to whom it's being delivered.
[time=3141] These must have the scriptural component present as the foundation.
[time=3145] It is a method the spirit uses to bring truth to one another.
[time=3149] We are prophesying right now.
[time=3151] We are bringing forth truth to you in a manner that's timely about an understanding about the Holy Spirit.
[time=3157] Fourth telling.
[time=3159] Not for telling.
[time=3160] It's for edification, reproof, correction, instruction and righteousness to bring courage
[time=3166] and confidence.
[time=3168] It's effectiveness and I want you to catch this is often increased where there is established relational equity where there's someone in your life is the foundation that they have
[time=3179] in order to say Rick, wait a second, I think this truth applies, they have insight.
[time=3186] Where it doesn't, what it doesn't look like just to be really clear there is a component of foretelling like Gene Dixon and the ones in the enquirer of foretelling, the future,
[time=3199] but just to be really clear, scriptural foundation for those who foretold things that were to be events, they had a pretty strict criteria.
[time=3208] It had to be right or stone, just to be really clear.
[time=3213] So fourth telling versus foretelling, just another thing to say that it isn't.
[time=3217] It isn't the pronouncing of new revelation as though God was speaking new words to be considered as scripture.
[time=3224] The scripture is God's completed word and there is not anything new to be added and nothing that can be taken away.
[time=3230] It isn't the futuristic proclamation of events like a fortune teller that don't come true.
[time=3238] The biblical precedence is that, death penalty.
[time=3242] So be really clear.
[time=3243] That insight is you speaking the truth of God to someone else in a timely manner and being
[time=3249] making sure that you're saying it in a way that is cautious to say the word of God is
[time=3255] what this is and it's not the word of Rick.
[time=3257] It's really good.
[time=3258] Holy Spirit, we have a few more questions we won't get to today, but we might be able to answer them in the class next.
[time=3263] Do you want to say one more thing?
[time=3264] No, I was just going to move to my next one, but if you're going to wrap it up, Holy Spirit is powerful.
[time=3270] It lives in us.
[time=3271] And hopefully you've enjoyed the series.
[time=3273] If you have other questions, these guys will be up here.
[time=3275] We'll be up here to answer anything you'd like to know.
[time=3277] At the end of the day, I think what we want to do is we want to preserve the unity we have in Christ.
[time=3284] And there are going to be things from the scriptures that we don't always see eye to eye on that might be a little to the left, a little to the right.
[time=3291] But as a community of believers, we center on Jesus Christ and his death on the cross.
[time=3298] That's where we land.
[time=3299] That's what we'll stand for.
[time=3300] That's the battle that I'm willing to die for.
[time=3302] And so are these men up here and many of you in here.
[time=3304] And I'm excited.
[time=3305] Webby, why don't you wrap up and then pray for us?
[time=3307] Yeah.
[time=3308] And speaking of that, the next series that we're going to go into starting next week is very much this amazing love that was saying about earlier.
[time=3315] And in light of what we really can agree on, we'll take Luke 22 to 24 and take 10 weeks and really focus in on this period of Jesus life.
[time=3324] These four days of his life or his amazing love was demonstrated.
[time=3328] So we're going to call it four days, this series hashtag.
[time=3333] With Portraits of Love is the hashtag.
[time=3335] So Portraits of Love.
[time=3336] So we're going to look into these episodes in his life as he's, he comes not to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.
[time=3344] So please bring people the next 10 weeks we're ending on Easter, that seems appropriate, four days, this great demonstration of his love in this little period of time, this little window of time, please bring people in that need to hear about Jesus, people from your neighborhood.
[time=3359] We would invite you to invite them as we do that.
[time=3363] One thing, the spirit always points to the sun, always, always, always, anything of the
[time=3370] spirit that points on the spirit is not pointing to the point where the Holy Spirit himself
[time=3376] said he was going to point to Jesus.
[time=3381] Well said.
[time=3382] Well, thanks for watching everybody.
[time=3387] This morning was an opportunity for us to respond to questions that people submitted.
[time=3391] I'm sure that you having watched have some more questions.
[time=3395] Please reach out to us here with those questions.
[time=3398] We would love to come alongside you and to help answer them as best we can.
[time=3402] It was a great joy for the four of us to tally our, to rally together and to get responses
[time=3408] to those questions and really feel like we were helping people where they were, but you're probably watching.
[time=3413] You have some questions of your own.
[time=3414] So please write into us.
[time=3415] Please call us with your questions and we'd be happy to answer them as best we can.
[time=3420] As we close your, our, our series in the Holy Spirit, we wanted you to know the Holy Spirit
[time=3426] is a comforter.
[time=3428] He's a counselor.
[time=3429] He's one who comes alongside and we want to be that for you as well.
[time=3433] All this talk with the Holy Spirit over the last few weeks, perhaps the Holy Spirit has been working in your life.
[time=3439] Perhaps you really feel a need this morning and I would love to take a minute and just to pray with you and for you this morning.
[time=3447] God thank you for those that are watching today.
[time=3449] Thank you for the privilege of serving them in this way.
[time=3452] God, all this talk on the Holy Spirit, these last weeks, I pray that if he is working in their life and he does and he can and he will pray that they would be responsive to that movement in their life.
[time=3462] God, if there's a need out there, anyone from the sound of my voice, I'm so grateful that
[time=3468] you are quick to meet those needs that you know us, God.
[time=3470] You know us better than we know ourselves.
[time=3472] So today I want to pray for those watching.
[time=3475] I want to pray God in light of the fact that you have provided everything we need in the person of your son, Jesus and I leave them this morning God with that great knowledge that he loves them and gave himself for them.
[time=3486] Here are all those things Father in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3497] In my King that I am with you, amazing love I know it's true, it's my joy to honor you
[time=3519] in all I do, I honor you, in all I do, I honor you.
