[time=60] Well, good morning, everyone.
[time=65] My name's Steve Webster.
[time=67] Thank you for watching the Bible Hour.
[time=69] Thank you for being a part of our family.
[time=71] Thank you for your dedication to this ministry.
[time=74] We are steadfastly trying week by week, day by day, to be a blessing to this community.
[time=81] And this is one way we get to do it.
[time=82] And I'm so grateful that you have a lot of to do it for these many years.
[time=86] What you're going to hear this morning is the first week of our new series called, we're calling it four days.
[time=93] It's a look at the last four days of Jesus' life.
[time=96] And along the way, we're just taking some snapshots.
[time=99] Christ comes, and you'll hear this verse this morning in my message.
[time=102] Christ comes as a servant.
[time=105] He comes motivated by love to serve those around him.
[time=109] And so there's all these little moments of him serving over the course of the next several weeks as part of the series, you're going to see this.
[time=119] And we're just going to invite people to be a part of it with a hashtag on different social media services.
[time=124] So be looking for more information about that.
[time=126] But we're really excited about this series.
[time=128] We're really excited to focus on the person of Jesus.
[time=132] So we invite you to join us as we do that.
[time=137] In conjunction with our four days series, starting on February 22nd, which is the first
[time=143] Sunday of Lent or the preparation season, we're going to do what we've always done here.
[time=147] We've done for several years, that is we're going to have resources available to you for the preparation.
[time=153] That's what we're calling these weeks leading up to Easter to Resurrection Sunday in conjunction with our Sunday morning services on our website is going to be information regarding Bible
[time=164] verses to be reading prayers that will accompany those things and also ways in which you can set aside things by way of a spiritual discipline, the Bible calls that fasting.
[time=174] So you're just setting those things aside and in its place, replacing it with some sort of spiritual discipline.
[time=180] So we're inviting people to those spiritual disciplines, but the course of the preparation.
[time=185] Jesus, in those days leading up to his time of departure, as he called it, spent his time
[time=191] very intensely focused.
[time=193] We want to share that focus that he had of orienting himself toward obedience and toward
[time=199] God the Father.
[time=200] If you're new to church, if you're new to Jesus, if you're new to any of it, we just encourage you to come and be a part of what we're calling starting point here at Blackout.
[time=210] That's coming up on March 8th at 9 o'clock in the morning.
[time=214] We want you to be a part of what it's like to be connected in this place.
[time=217] It's going to be a big place.
[time=218] It can be a little daunting.
[time=219] And so we would love to offer you an opportunity to connect with real people to get your questions answered.
[time=225] That's leadership is going to be involved in this and so people that know the answers to your questions or can at least direct you to those answers are going to be in this meeting.
[time=233] That's 9 o'clock, March 8th, room 178, please come and be a part of it.
[time=238] Please set aside time to be connected, to reconnect.
[time=242] If you're new to faith, if you're new to Jesus, new to Blackout, all of it, we used to just encourage you to come as we often do.
[time=250] You are a part of our family.
[time=251] So it would give us great joy if during the season leading up to Easter Sunday, if you'd come and be a part of our Sunday morning services.
[time=260] Starting point is a way to, it's a good entry point, it's a good, forgive me, starting point to do that.
[time=266] So please come and be a part of that just opportunity to connect on Sunday morning.
[time=273] If you've been watching for many years, you know that the Bible hour has been a gift that we've given to the community.
[time=279] There's a chance that you have to be a sponsor to support Bible hour in its ministry.
[time=285] You can do that for a loved one, for a birthday, for an anniversary.
[time=290] Don't miss the opportunity to be a blessing to a ministry that's been a blessing to you and to your family.
[time=296] We're so grateful for the times that you let us know, you let us know often how the Bible hour has been a blessing to you.
[time=303] In this recent days, there's a woman I talked to who came to Blackout to be baptized because
[time=309] she first looked for a church community and found it on the Bible hour.
[time=312] We want to honor that commitment by offering this to you and you can honor that ministry
[time=318] by sponsorships, information about that's on the screen before me.
[time=322] Thank you for being a part of our church family.
[time=324] Thank you for all that you've done over the years to encourage us.
[time=327] I hope that we've done the same for you.
[time=339] Thank you for being a part of our church family and thank you so much for being a part
[time=352] of our church family.
[time=354] Thank you for being a part of our church family and thank you for being a part of our church
[time=360] family.
[time=361] Thank you for being a part of our church family.
[time=378] Thank you for being a part of our church family and thank you for being a part of our church
[time=384] family.
[time=385] Thank you for being a part of our church family.
[time=548] There is nothing that can separate somebody who is in Christ from his love.
[time=556] And the word nothing there in Romans 8 means nothing.
[time=561] or depth, anything Paul says in all creation.
[time=566] So I hope you believe that today.
[time=569] I think we might all not our heads and say yes, that's what the Bible says to you, that's exactly right.
[time=573] But do you live like that?
[time=575] And that kind of confidence.
[time=577] Hope you do.
[time=579] What a great thing to sing as we begin our morning.
[time=582] Take out your bulletins if you would everybody.
[time=584] Just some things I want you to jot down.
[time=586] As we begin this series called Four Days and then hashtag Snapshots, Snapshots of Love.
[time=596] There are several things to say as we begin this, but I want you to jot down a couple of things as we begin today.
[time=606] The Bible, the Bible is basically about God
[time=612] and what he has done.
[time=616] So I want you to draw a series of circles.
[time=619] This will be on the screens in front of you and behind me.
[time=621] Just draw this out and you can be crude as you draw it.
[time=625] But just basic, the basic idea, the Bible is 66 books written over thousands of years and what the Bible is basically about is God revealing himself to us.
[time=640] That's what it's about.
[time=641] So you can read a book like Leviticus from the Bible and be thrilled to see that God is revealing himself to these people in this way, in these pages.
[time=651] There are things for you to do there to be sure.
[time=654] But the Bible's focus, the Bible's message primarily is about God, what he has done, what he is like, what he loves, what he doesn't love.
[time=665] And that will certainly trickle down to your life and things that you should do in a rich and abundant and free life or a life that's not rich, abundant and free.
[time=674] The New Testament is the second part of what we call the Bible.
[time=677] That's 27 books written in less than 100 years around the time of the birth of Jesus and everything that follows after him.
[time=686] So there's a picture developing here.
[time=689] The Bible's over thousands of years and then there's all this cluster of books around this event, around the birth of Jesus, 27 of them.
[time=697] And they're all very much focused on this person, whose name is Jesus, this flurry of activity around his birth, his life, his death, his resurrection.
[time=709] There are four Gospels, the one that we're gonna be in the next four weeks is the Gospel of Luke.
[time=714] The Gospel of Luke, I would encourage you to take these next 10 weeks, excuse me, and read through it with us.
[time=721] And start from the beginning, we're only gonna be in chapters 23 through 24, leading up to Easter Sunday, but go back all the way to the beginning and read through Luke's Gospel.
[time=729] I'll be walking through a lot of it with you today, but don't miss the chance.
[time=733] Luke's Gospel is intensely focused on this life of Jesus.
[time=738] Not all four Gospels have information about his birth, about all the things surrounding his birth.
[time=743] Luke does, because lots of information about it.
[time=746] But most of the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, are about three years of this one life, thousands of years in the Bible, less than a hundred years, New Testament, about three and a half years in the Gospels, his public ministry.
[time=763] And now you have what we come to this morning is this last week of Jesus' life, the Passion Week.
[time=768] That's basically the triumphal entry, Palm Sunday, the week of the Sunday before Easter to Easter.
[time=774] That covers in Luke's Gospel friends five chapters, five chapters, 25% or so on one week of his life.
[time=784] Where we're gonna be, the next 10 weeks is on four days.
[time=789] The Passion Week is that last week of his life, and we're gonna spend the next 10 weeks on Luke's account of the last four days of his life on earth.
[time=798] All with this focus on what is the Bible basically about?
[time=803] It's about God disclosing himself to us.
[time=805] That has never been clearer than in this person, the person of Jesus.
[time=811] And God is intensely interested in this time in his life.
[time=814] Why?
[time=816] Everything in the Bible has led to this moment.
[time=819] Either leads to it or flows out from it.
[time=822] I had a baptism class this morning with a few people, a first hour.
[time=826] I took him to Genesis chapter three, verse 15, where this remarkable statement is found that he will crush your head, the seat of the woman, the son of the woman will crush the head of the serpent, but he will strike your heel.
[time=838] Even there, Genesis three, this is this picture of one day salvation will come.
[time=844] One day all the deceit and all the ruin, the serpent, Satan, the deceiver has brought about, will all be undone.
[time=851] It's all led to this moment.
[time=853] So we wanted to join, and I guess maybe share the Bible's perspective of itself.
[time=859] What's the Bible really about?
[time=860] What's it trying to tell us?
[time=862] It's telling us this story, that there is a great fall, a great tragic departure from what God has said, and God has been busy working to reverse that, and ultimately he does it in the person of Jesus.
[time=875] I very much believe today that we need to hear this all over again, like you've never heard it before.
[time=882] That somebody in here today, someone in the sound of my voice today needs to hear that this great story unfolding for thousands and thousands of years finds its culmination, its high point in this person, whose name is Jesus, who loved us and gave himself for us.
[time=898] You need to know that.
[time=900] This morning, this week has been hard on you.
[time=903] You come into this room today, or maybe you're watching on the broadcast, I don't know where you're from, the place from which you're coming, or where you find yourself today.
[time=911] But you're tired, and you're weary, and you're busted up.
[time=915] This, the church is not a museum for perfect people.
[time=920] It's a hospital for broken people.
[time=921] So that's what we're about here in this place.
[time=924] That's what we aspire to be as a congregation, a hospital for broken people, needing redemption.
[time=932] And, oh dear friends, it is possible in this person, the person of Jesus, the one of whom the Holy Spirit, we've been talking about him for weeks, he bears witness of him.
[time=944] Here are some key verses that we're gonna focus on.
[time=947] They're really kind of where the birthplace of this whole series.
[time=951] It's Luke 22 verses 25 through 27.
[time=953] I'm not sure it's gonna be in the screen behind me or not, but write those verses down.
[time=956] These verses set up our whole series.
[time=961] It's Luke 22 verses 25 through 27.
[time=964] These are the words of Jesus.
[time=967] He says, he's talking to his disciples.
[time=970] You'll hear this in the coming weeks.
[time=972] He said to them, the kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them.
[time=978] They like to have control.
[time=979] They like to be in power.
[time=981] They like to be able to tell people what to do.
[time=984] And those in authority over them are called benefactors.
[time=987] Maybe you've had a boss like that.
[time=989] They like to make sure you knew that he or she was in charge all the time.
[time=993] But not so with you.
[time=997] If you're an underliner in your Bible, underline those words that begin verse 26, but not so with you.
[time=1003] Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest and the leader as one who, what class, serves service for who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves?
[time=1021] Is it not the one who reclines at table?
[time=1024] But I'm among you as the one who serves.
[time=1028] Jesus, the very person that should require the most service that deserved it, the Lord of all creation, God's own son is among you as one who serves.
[time=1038] That should hover over all the things we talk about over the next 10 weeks as these four days are focused on this great act of service.
[time=1048] Mark 1045 says the son of man came not to be served, you know these verse, but to serve, to give his life as a ransom for many.
[time=1057] This is the ultimate act of service.
[time=1060] We're gonna show you a clip this morning from a movie that you'll recognize.
[time=1065] We're in Luke 22 today versus one through 13.
[time=1067] So maybe make sure you're turning back there to Luke 22 starting in verse one.
[time=1070] But in this verse is the beginning of the end for Jesus.
[time=1074] Everything that he has done has led to this point in this moment.
[time=1080] And part of today is the beginning of the plot to betray and ultimately murder Jesus.
[time=1087] This morning as you watch this clip, I want you to see a couple of things.
[time=1090] This great act of service and sacrifice that he's gonna put forward for us, he did it with his eyes wide open.
[time=1097] He knew what he was gonna experience.
[time=1099] He knows what it's like to be betrayed.
[time=1102] Some of you do too.
[time=1103] He experienced that pain, friends, willingly, for you that you might be free, that you might be saved.
[time=1112] Watch this clip, I'll come back in a minute and talk about what you've seen here.
[time=1116] (gentle music)
[time=1129] (gentle music) We must have alliance with England to prevail here.
[time=1159] You achieved that, you saved your family, increased your land.
[time=1165] In time, you will have all the power and Scotland.
[time=1170] Lands, titles, men, power, nothing, nothing.
[time=1175] They have nothing.
[time=1178] When fight for me, because if they do not,
[time=1184] I throw them off my land and I starve their wives and their children, those men who bled the ground red at Falkirk, they fought for William Wallace and he fights for something that I've never had.
[time=1200] And I took it from him when I betrayed him
[time=1206] and I saw it in his face on the battlefield.
[time=1209] And it's tearing me apart.
[time=1211] Oh, men betray, all loose hearts.
[time=1215] They'll wear those hearts.
[time=1216] I wanna believe, as he does.
[time=1225] I will never be on the wrong side again.
[time=1244] Robert the Bruce, never be on the wrong side again.
[time=1248] Robert the Bruce, spoiler alert, Braveheart.
[time=1252] Robert the Bruce, at the end, ends up on the right side and leads his fellow Skoltzmann to victory on the battlefield.
[time=1262] There are two people in this story that will betray or lose faith in Jesus, but that's not the end for both.
[time=1270] Of course, the one who you would think of as the betrayer of Jesus is who.
[time=1274] Judas, who is the other person along the way in the story that says he doesn't know Jesus and really in that sense betrays him?
[time=1281] Peter, do Judas and Peter come to very different ends?
[time=1284] They do, they do.
[time=1287] Only a friend can betray a friend.
[time=1291] And Jesus knew from very early on, it's in John chapters four and following.
[time=1296] He knows the story.
[time=1298] He knows who Judas is.
[time=1300] The other 11 don't seem to have any idea he's gonna eventually be the one that betrays him, but Jesus knows and he walks into it willingly.
[time=1308] It's that kind of love, friends.
[time=1311] It's that kind of display of selfless sacrifice that Jesus comes to put on, to demonstrate, to display.
[time=1320] And I stand before you this morning with great, great joy proclaiming it to you.
[time=1328] Betrayal is a painful thing.
[time=1331] You can see it on his face.
[time=1333] It's just tearing him apart, he says.
[time=1335] This is a hard thing to read some of these verses because it is painful to watch it all come undone.
[time=1341] Let's read our passage for this morning, friends.
[time=1344] It's Luke 22 verses one through 13.
[time=1346] There are notes in your bulletin if you wanna follow along.
[time=1349] Here's the main idea for today.
[time=1351] Here's the takeaway.
[time=1352] As I read this passage over and over and over again, this saying out to me, you ready?
[time=1358] Here is the main idea for today in these 13 verses.
[time=1361] God is actively working out his grand plan for salvation and the good of his children.
[time=1381] He's been doing that for since creation.
[time=1384] Since Genesis chapter three, verse 15, he's been doing it.
[time=1387] He's actively working out his plan and oh, it all comes together in these four days.
[time=1392] It is all honing in on this, just a few hours.
[time=1396] He's 96 hours of time.
[time=1399] Less than 100 hours of time is the focal point of all of eternity.
[time=1402] It's the most important things that have ever happened or ever will happen are about to unfold before you in Luke's Gospel, the death and resurrection of Christ.
[time=1410] How beautiful.
[time=1411] What a better use of our time could there be than this?
[time=1414] Look at Luke 22, verse one, the Feast of Unleavened Bread, Jr., which is called the Passover.
[time=1420] The chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put him to death where they feared the people.
[time=1426] There are three words to fill in in your outline this morning.
[time=1430] The first one is from these first two verses, it's the word sacrifice, sacrifice.
[time=1436] The Feast of Unleavened Bread, Jr., which is called the Passover.
[time=1441] This feast lasted from the 15th to 21st day of Nissan, which is about March, April, in the Jewish calendar, in our calendar, and their calendar was in the month of Nissan.
[time=1452] So it'd be about March, April for us.
[time=1453] March, April, sun's pretty good right about now.
[time=1455] I drove north from Nashville with a friend yesterday and I could watch the sky get grayers.
[time=1461] I drove north, grayer and grayer.
[time=1463] Across the Ohio River, it was like, I'll just, the switch got thrown.
[time=1466] So anyway, spring is coming.
[time=1469] Spring is coming.
[time=1470] Be patient.
[time=1472] It says that this feast, the Feast of Unleavened Bread, Jr., which is called the Passover.
[time=1479] The chief priests and the scribes during this feast, remembering the redemption and salvation of Israel by God in the Old Testament are actively working out a plot to kill Jesus.
[time=1492] I'll say that again.
[time=1494] The irony is really thick.
[time=1497] During a feast which celebrates the time when God miraculously intervenes to save his people from bondage and slavery, these people are actively plotting to murder Jesus.
[time=1510] Wow.
[time=1513] And I think Luke is intentionally drawing those things together for us.
[time=1517] This happened at this time for a reason.
[time=1521] These aren't the high priests.
[time=1522] These chief priests aren't the high priests.
[time=1524] These are guys from the chief families.
[time=1526] He was murdered friends by religious people.
[time=1530] By respectable people.
[time=1532] They actively conspire to murder him.
[time=1536] The scribes are experts here.
[time=1538] This is verse two.
[time=1539] The scribes, they handle written documents.
[time=1541] They taught, they interpreted the law, they regulated the law.
[time=1544] They knew the Bible backwards, what we call the Bible, backwards and forwards and upside down and they were the ones actively seeking a way to kill Jesus.
[time=1554] That word there in verse two, we're seeking, it's a word, it's constantly in motion.
[time=1559] Seeking, seeking, seeking, seeking, seeking, seeking.
[time=1561] They never stopped looking for a way to kill him.
[time=1564] They weren't making up their minds about him.
[time=1567] They had decided and they were gonna go this direction.
[time=1570] All of these things, God has a plan.
[time=1574] He is working out for salvation and for the good of his people.
[time=1578] They don't even know they're working in league with what God has already in mind.
[time=1582] They don't even know it.
[time=1583] Judas doesn't know.
[time=1584] He thinks he's running interference, but he's not.
[time=1587] He's only serving God's larger purposes for redemption, for salvation.
[time=1591] There was no other way it could have happened, but for the sacrifice of Jesus.
[time=1596] And even that's in his control.
[time=1598] Even that's under his sovereign hand of guidance.
[time=1603] Wow.
[time=1604] His whole life has been about this sacrifice.
[time=1610] These people, verse two, the chief priests and scribes should have been the first ones to say, I know who this person is.
[time=1616] He's the Messiah, he's come to save us, but they were the ones that actively worked to destroy him because he was a threat to their position.
[time=1625] It's terrible.
[time=1627] This is terribly sad, friends, terribly sad.
[time=1630] Their lack of vision, their fear, all that garbage and ugliness contributes unbeknownst to them to the salvation of those who believe.
[time=1643] God knows what he is doing, oftentimes in spite of us, in spite of these people, they're conspiring, they're scheming, they're murdering manipulations, are merely acting out the grand plane of God on the universe's stage.
[time=1657] Jesus would die for our sins, and he walks this path willingly with his eyes wide open.
[time=1666] Look at Philippians chapter two, it'll be on the screens behind me in front of you.
[time=1672] Paul there says this, he says, have this mind or this attitude among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus.
[time=1679] Who, though he was in the form of God, didn't count a quality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself.
[time=1688] Taking the form of a servant, if you're inclined to mark in your Bibles, mark that word, servant, being born in the likeness of men, and being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[time=1704] Therefore, God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, that the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth, and under the earth, and every tongue confessed that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[time=1719] He has been exalted, he has the name of every name
[time=1726] because he was murdered.
[time=1729] His murder didn't compromise any of that.
[time=1731] It leads to his highest exaltation.
[time=1734] They don't know what they're doing.
[time=1736] The Romans use crucifixion as a very powerful weapon.
[time=1740] We will nail you to a cross if you mess with us.
[time=1743] You think you lift it up?
[time=1744] We'll lift you up on a cross.
[time=1745] Look at you now, and they don't even see that God gave him the name of every single name because he endured the cross, despising the shame.
[time=1756] He was lifted up for us.
[time=1759] It's all been about this.
[time=1760] This is the whole trajectory of history and certainly of his life.
[time=1766] In 1 Corinthians 5,7, Paul says this, "Christ, our Passover lamb has been sacrificed." I find it very interesting and I would just, this is an observation, you can take it or leave it.
[time=1779] There is no mention of the Passover lamb anywhere in this passage, even though that was part of their preparation.
[time=1787] I wonder if that was because the Passover lamb was in the room with them and the person of Christ.
[time=1792] I don't know.
[time=1794] I just couldn't help but notice it.
[time=1796] Ephesians 5 verses 1 and 2 says this, "Therefore be imitators of God as beloved children and walk in love as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God." Our main idea for the morning, God is actively working out his grand plan for salvation and the good of his children oftentimes when you can't see it in ways that you would never expect.
[time=1823] And you look back years later and say that's what God was doing.
[time=1826] That's what he was after.
[time=1827] Watch his methods.
[time=1830] Guys, watch him.
[time=1831] Stay close.
[time=1833] Stay in the shadow of the cross.
[time=1836] In Old Testament, Babylon didn't know they were being used by a guy to judge Israel, but they were.
[time=1840] There's a whole book of the Bible called Habakkuk about that.
[time=1843] God, how could you use these wicked Babylonians to judge us, we're your people, and they don't even know what's going on.
[time=1849] God has all these things happening friends to work his plans throughout the universe's history and we get to be a part of it and join with him in it.
[time=1859] Don't be motivated like these guys were by fear.
[time=1862] They feared the people, it says in verse two.
[time=1864] Do you see that in front of you?
[time=1865] Luke 22 says they feared the people.
[time=1867] Jerusalem swelled with people every time the Passover was celebrated because they had to go do it in Jerusalem.
[time=1875] That's where the meal needed to be eaten.
[time=1876] It was very clear from the Old Testament.
[time=1878] So the people or the population of the city swelled massively in that week, in that week's time.
[time=1885] And they were afraid.
[time=1886] I thought about 1 John 4, 18.
[time=1890] There's no fear in love.
[time=1893] Perfect love casts out fear.
[time=1895] Fear has to do with punishment.
[time=1897] Whoever fears has not been perfected in love.
[time=1900] This is a bad sign for them.
[time=1901] It's a bad look.
[time=1903] 2 Timothy chapter one, God gave us a spirit, not a fear, but of power and of love and of self control.
[time=1910] This is our destiny in Christ, sacrifice.
[time=1913] That's the first word that's shown out from this passage to me this week.
[time=1919] The second word is the word that the clip was taken from the word is betrayal.
[time=1924] And this is a very sad part of the story, but here it is.
[time=1927] The second word in your outline is betrayal.
[time=1933] I'm gonna read these words with you friends and just let them sit for a minute.
[time=1937] Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot,
[time=1944] who was of the number of the 12.
[time=1948] He went away and conferred with chief priests and officers how he might betray them to them.
[time=1955] And they were glad and agreed to give him money.
[time=1962] So he consented and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of a crowd.
[time=1970] I read those words this week and I just,
[time=1976] I was struck by the sadness I found there.
[time=1978] Satan entered Judas.
[time=1981] He's not a psychological reality.
[time=1983] He is an adversary.
[time=1985] The word Satan means adversary.
[time=1987] It means accuser.
[time=1989] He has this office, this role.
[time=1992] You know the verse, first Peter 5, be sober minded, be watchful, your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[time=2003] He is at work actively deceiving, accusing, opposing the work of God.
[time=2008] But even in this, he's defeated.
[time=2011] Even in this, he's entering Judas, betray Jesus, hand him over to the chief priests and scribes so he'll be killed by the Romans and even that accomplishes God's purposes.
[time=2020] He is a defeated foe, even here.
[time=2023] But he is a foe and not to be trifled with.
[time=2027] We have a real enemy, a real adversary.
[time=2029] Please don't lose sight of that.
[time=2032] And be watchful, be sober minded as Peter says here.
[time=2036] Be watchful, know what's going on.
[time=2039] God's grand design, his grand plan for salvation,
[time=2046] for redemption, for the good of his people, even Judas is involved in that.
[time=2049] He doesn't even know it.
[time=2050] Judas is called a scariot in verse three.
[time=2054] That's just where he was from, probably a place called Karyoth in southern Judea.
[time=2058] Maybe your Bible has a note about that.
[time=2060] That's what that's about, Judas is scariot.
[time=2063] He was among the 12 and Jesus knew he never truly believed, but he was there, among them.
[time=2070] To betray here in verse four is to hand over.
[time=2075] By the way, look at these verbs in verse four.
[time=2079] He went away and conferred how he might betray.
[time=2083] It wasn't, he didn't make a whoopsy.
[time=2084] Like Satan wasn't like drifting, drifting, drifting.
[time=2088] He makes a decision, decision, decision.
[time=2090] This is pretty bleak, this is very sad.
[time=2093] Peter gets caught up in a moment and gets away from him big time.
[time=2097] Don't even know him, don't even know him, don't even know him.
[time=2100] Never heard of him before, and he repents.
[time=2104] There is no repentance with Judas.
[time=2106] He was given over for you.
[time=2110] He was dealt treacherously with, look at me, listen friends, he was dealt with treacherously for you.
[time=2118] This word betrays to be handed over, and he walks into it with his eyes wide open.
[time=2125] There is nobody behind Jesus with his arm behind his back, shoving him along.
[time=2130] He walks that road willingly for you.
[time=2134] Because he loves you.
[time=2136] He loved us and gave himself for us.
[time=2139] This is the same word used in Romans four.
[time=2143] It says, Jesus our Lord who was delivered up for our trespasses.
[time=2149] That's behind all this, this betrayal, this scoundrel behavior, this treachery is all serving the greater end.
[time=2159] All serving the greater end that God has in mind.
[time=2163] These chief priests and officers, verse five, friends are evil.
[time=2166] They were glad when he showed up to betray Jesus.
[time=2172] They were glad, and they gave him money.
[time=2174] Isaiah five says, woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.
[time=2185] There's a chilling scene in the Passion of the Christ, which I've only ever watched once.
[time=2193] I'm not sure I'll ever see it again, honestly.
[time=2195] I don't know if I could do it.
[time=2197] I think that's probably true.
[time=2200] I think it's just really hard to watch.
[time=2203] I can't remember sobbing like that.
[time=2205] Maybe ever in my life, have that experience.
[time=2207] Anybody else?
[time=2208] I'm not alone.
[time=2209] There's a scene at his trial, that's where we're headed,
[time=2215] where it's from the Gospel of John and say, his blood beyond us and on our children.
[time=2221] Remember that?
[time=2223] They didn't know what they were doing.
[time=2226] They did not know what they were doing, but they were all serving the greater end.
[time=2230] God's plan for salvation is at work.
[time=2236] We didn't even know it, we didn't see it sometimes, and it's all happening.
[time=2239] In Acts seven, this is the second part of Luke's, to work, to book work here, Acts seven.
[time=2249] It says, "You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised "and harden ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit.
[time=2256] "As your fathers did so do you, "which are the prophets if your fathers not persecute, "and they killed those who announced beforehand "the coming of the righteous one, "whom you have now betrayed and murdered.
[time=2271] "You who received the law as delivered by angels, "by messengers and didn't keep it." God's working it out.
[time=2278] He suffered the humiliation, the murder, and betrayal as the righteous one who would suffer as an innocent on behalf of the guilty.
[time=2285] He did it for you.
[time=2291] Sacrifice, betrayal.
[time=2295] And then number three here is the word vision.
[time=2298] I was struck by this, as I read this last part of this section of chapter 22, we're in verse seven.
[time=2307] Then came the day of unleavened bread in which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.
[time=2311] So Jesus sent Peter and John saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us that we may eat it." They said to him, "Where will you have us prepare it?" He said to them, "Behold, when you have entered the city, "a man carrying a jar of water will meet you.
[time=2326] "Follow him into the house that he enters "and tell the master of the house.
[time=2330] "The teacher says to you, 'Where is the guest room?
[time=2334] "Where I may eat the Passover with my disciples.
[time=2337] "And he will show you a large upper room furnished.
[time=2340] "Prepare it there." Verse 13, "They went and found it just as he had told them." And they prepared the Passover.
[time=2348] This is Luke 19, three chapters earlier.
[time=2355] He goes, the same thing happens.
[time=2357] He says, "There's gonna be a cult tied.
[time=2360] "Go find it, untie it, bring it back." And they went and found it just as he had told them.
[time=2365] Exactly the same language is used in Luke 19.
[time=2367] Vision is number three here.
[time=2370] He has a clear-eyed vision of things that have not happened yet.
[time=2376] Your future is not unknown to him.
[time=2383] I will repeat myself.
[time=2385] Your future is not unknown to him.
[time=2390] It's unknown to you guys as students.
[time=2392] Your future is ahead of you.
[time=2393] It's unclear.
[time=2394] It's cloudy.
[time=2395] It's expensive.
[time=2396] Your parents are freaking out.
[time=2398] God has never freaked out.
[time=2403] That's pretty sophisticated to say.
[time=2405] God is not in the freaking out business.
[time=2408] Do you know why?
[time=2409] He's already there.
[time=2410] He knows what's gonna happen.
[time=2413] No one take him by surprise.
[time=2415] I don't know, I don't know.
[time=2416] That was gonna happen.
[time=2417] He's never said that.
[time=2419] I didn't see that coming.
[time=2420] Also very sophisticated.
[time=2424] I think of Romans 8.
[time=2426] And we know, and we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.
[time=2435] God is actively working out his grand plan for salvation and the good of his children.
[time=2440] You don't know why the things are happening to you, why they're happening to you.
[time=2445] And that's hard sometimes.
[time=2446] It's hard most times, but they are happening.
[time=2448] He does.
[time=2449] He knows what they're happening to you.
[time=2451] You don't.
[time=2452] He loves you.
[time=2455] We know all things together for good.
[time=2459] And all things there is all things.
[time=2462] That's the translation, all things.
[time=2464] It's all encompassing, all things.
[time=2470] He's actively pursuing obedience.
[time=2475] His willing sacrifice was the culmination of God's grand plan of redemption.
[time=2480] All the way back to Luke chapter nine.
[time=2482] It says in Luke nine, 51.
[time=2483] It says, "When the days drew near for him "to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem." The United States, he resolutely set out for Jerusalem.
[time=2495] The NASP says he was determined to go to Jerusalem.
[time=2500] This is 13 chapters earlier.
[time=2505] In Luke nine, earlier in that chapter, the transfiguration scene is the case.
[time=2510] This is Luke nine, 28.
[time=2511] He says this.
[time=2512] Now about eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter and John and James, went up the mountain to pray.
[time=2519] As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, his clothing became dazzling white and behold two men were walking with him, excuse me, talking with him, Moses and Elijah, who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
[time=2536] Now this scene has long, isn't that fascinating?
[time=2541] And the Gospels say very little about it.
[time=2544] And I want more.
[time=2547] It's like the Hobbit movies, it's like 10 hours on one book that's only this big.
[time=2550] It's like, but the Bible's got restraint unlike Peter Jackson.
[time=2553] Bible has a lot more restraint than he does, apparently.
[time=2556] Inside joke, if you know Lord of the Rings.
[time=2557] Anyway, so.
[time=2560] Jesus, who appears still on the mountain, two Old Testament characters, who are they?
[time=2567] Moses and Elijah, they show up on the mountain top, dazzling white clothing as no laundry on earth can make them what do they really talk about?
[time=2576] His departure at Jerusalem.
[time=2579] I think speculation, alert, sounding.
[time=2582] I think they've been waiting to talk about this for a long, long time.
[time=2587] And up they show, it's about to happen, isn't it?
[time=2591] Yeah, it's about to happen.
[time=2593] Just a few days away now.
[time=2594] This has been the focus of all eternity, what they wanted to talk about.
[time=2601] What are Moses and Elijah, and what are Moses and Elijah and Jesus talk about?
[time=2604] That'd be fun to think about.
[time=2605] Well, I'll tell you, we have the answer, his departure at Jerusalem.
[time=2608] That's what they talk about.
[time=2612] That's their focus, that should be our focus too.
[time=2617] But there's more.
[time=2619] In Luke 18, before this, he has for the third time predicted his death, for the third time already at that point.
[time=2626] Hey guys, this is gonna happen.
[time=2632] And Peter goes, nah, nah, it's not gonna happen.
[time=2636] He says, get behind me, Satan, you don't know what you're talking about.
[time=2640] In Luke, Luke chapter two, Simeon's righteous and devout person named Simeon, is waiting for the consolation of Israel, the comfort of Israel, the salvation of Israel.
[time=2651] He says to Mary, the mother of Jesus, a sword will pierce through your own soul.
[time=2656] Seeing ahead, he hasn't even been born yet.
[time=2660] Seeing ahead, the great work on the cross that Mary will watch and suffer through.
[time=2665] This is the Bible's focus from beginning to end.
[time=2673] In this passage, it's about three things, essentially.
[time=2676] It's about sacrifice, betrayal,
[time=2682] but a vision, a clear-eyed vision of what is to come.
[time=2686] The main idea here is that God is actively working out, his grand plan for salvation and the good of his children.
[time=2694] You need never doubt that.
[time=2696] I wanna read this with you and I wanna pray and I wanna invite you to respond.
[time=2703] Some of you have been sitting here for a long time, many, many years, and you like Jesus a lot.
[time=2709] You're very interested.
[time=2711] You nod your head, your polite.
[time=2713] He died for your sins.
[time=2716] And I want you to, I'm gonna ask you, there's two more, two songs we're gonna sing as Darren comes.
[time=2723] We're gonna sing two songs in response that we've heard this morning.
[time=2727] And as those songs are played, there'll be elders down here in front to pray with you.
[time=2732] And some of you this morning have never responded in faith to Christ, never.
[time=2738] The Bible says, if you confess to your mouth, Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you'll be saved.
[time=2745] And today might be that day for you.
[time=2749] If you're in the sound of my voice, you can hear me say this, I invite you to consider that as well.
[time=2753] Friends, it's good for us to think about these things.
[time=2757] I invite you to come down.
[time=2758] And that today is the day of your salvation.
[time=2761] Don't delay.
[time=2762] Ephesians two says it this way.
[time=2765] Frames the need in this way.
[time=2767] And you were dead, and the trespasses and sins in which you once walked following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience, among whom we all once lived, and the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind, verse four, but God.
[time=2792] But God being rich in mercy, because of the great love, which he loved us.
[time=2799] Even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ by grace, you have been saved and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[time=2812] I'm gonna pray right now, this morning, and I invite you to respond, respond in faith.
[time=2819] If you pray this prayer to be saved, come down and tell us about it.
[time=2825] We wanna rejoice with you.
[time=2826] Would you pray with me?
[time=2829] Heavenly Father, what a story you are telling.
[time=2836] You invite us to be a part of that story.
[time=2840] Father, this morning, today, right now, somebody from the sound of my voice, that needs to respond to be saved.
[time=2849] And all they have to do is cry out.
[time=2852] God, I can't do it on my own.
[time=2855] I've been trying, and I can't.
[time=2856] I thank you that Jesus has done it.
[time=2860] He has paid it all.
[time=2861] I believe that he is who he says he is,
[time=2867] and that he can forgive me of my sins.
[time=2871] I choose to follow him and to walk in newness of life.
[time=2874] God, if anyone prayed that prayer this morning, your word says they're a new creation.
[time=2879] The old things have gone, the new have come.
[time=2882] We wanna rejoice with them this morning, God, so please give them courage to come and talk to us.
[time=2886] And God, if anyone else needs to come and pray, we'll be down front.
[time=2890] In response to this great act of service and love, thank you for this morning.
[time=2895] Thank you that your faithfulness, God, is indeed great.
[time=2900] Pray all those things in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=2903] You need to pray with us, come down front.
