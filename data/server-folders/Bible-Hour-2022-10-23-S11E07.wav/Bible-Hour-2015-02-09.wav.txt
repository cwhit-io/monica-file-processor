[time=60] Good morning, I'm Darren McCown and I am with my friends, Jordan and Matthew Dilman with their parents, Randy and Becky Dilman, and it's a huge day for some young men and women this morning, and as we're going to baptize them, it's a huge day for all of us, really, but they're going to read their testimonies to you this morning before they get baptized.
[time=90] I don't remember a time without Jesus, I first accepted Christ in my life with a prayer, I said thank you Lord for accepting me, please help me through the rest of my life, since I've accepted Jesus, I've had more good things in my life that I would have if I didn't accept Christ as my Savior.
[time=110] Since accepting Christ, I enjoy serving infants and love them as Jesus loved me, I make friends with everyone I meet and I'm working hard to obey my parents.
[time=119] I know that I'm a sinner but I'm happy that people see Christ in me, I know that Jesus is God's Son and that the Lord is my Savior, who will save me from my sins.
[time=128] >> Amen, thanks, Jordan.
[time=130] [APPLAUSE]
[time=138] >> I asked Jesus into my heart when I was four, I prayed to Jesus and said, "Jesus, thank you for all you have done for me and help me through the things that I have done wrong, amen.
[time=148] Since I have asked Jesus into my heart, I become more bold in faith by one, stood up to be friends with someone who no one wants to be friends with.
[time=159] Two, helped my grandma to start asking questions about God.
[time=165] Three, turn the other cheek when someone was being mean to me.
[time=170] I know that I have sinned in my life and I believe that Jesus is God's Son and he is my Lord and Savior.
[time=181] [APPLAUSE]
[time=191] >> All right, in view of your confession of faith, Jordan Alan Dilman, I baptize you in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=203] [APPLAUSE]
[time=215] >> In view of your confession of faith, Matthew Robert Dilman, I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=225] [APPLAUSE]
[time=235] >> I was seven years old and in my first grade when my teacher, Mr. Guthrie, was talking about Jesus in heaven and how great heaven was going to be.
[time=250] This made me curious and excited and I wanted to know more about what it took to be in heaven.
[time=255] When my mom came home from work, I asked her to talk about me with me about inviting Jesus to my heart so that I could live and have them with him.
[time=266] My mom told me that we need a Savior to pay for our sins because we can't do it ourselves and that Jesus the Son of God died on the cross for my sins and rose from the dead to overcome all sin and death.
[time=281] My mom and I prayed together and I asked Jesus to come into my heart and now I want to obey him in his word and be baptized.
[time=290] [APPLAUSE]
[time=295] >> That was Dylan Whitman and this is his sister Erica Whitman with their parents Brian and Kim Whitman.
[time=302] >> My story is very similar to my brothers. I was in first grade in a class led by Mr. Guthrie.
[time=307] Mr. Guthrie was talking about heaven and how amazingly perfect it was going to be when we arrived there.
[time=312] I remember him talking about being with Jesus all the time and having no pain, sorrow or struggles.
[time=318] I went home and asked my mom about Jesus so we went to my bedroom and talked.
[time=322] She explained that we needed a Savior to save us from our sins and that Jesus, the Son of God, came to earth, died on the cross and rose from the dead to overcome sin and death.
[time=331] After our discussion we prayed the prayer of salvation and ever since then I have been a Christian.
[time=338] As an act of obedience to God in his word I am getting baptized.
[time=343] [APPLAUSE]
[time=350] >> Dylan Michael Whitman in view of your confession of faith in front of all these people.
[time=357] I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=363] [APPLAUSE]
[time=376] >> Erica Paige Whitman in view of your confession of faith.
[time=380] I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=385] [APPLAUSE]
[time=399] >> You ready?
[time=400] >> Yep.
[time=401] >> All right, this is Lacey and you're the baker, right?
[time=404] You're going to make me some cookies.
[time=406] >> Yep.
[time=407] >> Okay, sweet.
[time=408] All right.
[time=409] [LAUGHTER] I'm excited.
[time=411] Ministry does pay.
[time=412] It's wonderful.
[time=413] All right, are you ready?
[time=415] >> Yeah.
[time=416] >> I'm excited that you're in here.
[time=417] This is just a cool morning.
[time=418] I'm so thankful that we get to experience these stories and just hear about what Jesus did in somebody's life because that's the only thing.
[time=424] It's the only thing in this world that's truly going to bring real and lasting transformation.
[time=429] Let's hear your story.
[time=431] >> My name is Lacey Curry.
[time=433] I am currently attending Ivy Tech for Conner Arts and Pastry and Baking.
[time=437] I started attending Black Hawk with my boyfriend Nick in August when I moved to Fort Wayne from Bluffton.
[time=442] I grew up in a Christian home and went to church every Sunday.
[time=445] I was taught to live a life based upon the Bible.
[time=448] Growing up, I knew that someday I would need to get baptized.
[time=451] But growing up, I also had a rebellious attitude and wanted to live for me.
[time=455] Doing the things I wanted to do was one of my priorities.
[time=458] This led me astray from God and led me towards people who were not good for me.
[time=462] In high school, I was heavily influenced by the people around me.
[time=466] I fell into peer pressure easily.
[time=468] I knew I was making choices that weren't right and I knew the path I was walking on was unfulfilling.
[time=473] Throughout junior and senior year of high school, as I was in my most rebellious stage, I kept having recurring thoughts of baptism.
[time=482] However, at the time, baptism did not sound right because I knew it would have to change my ways.
[time=487] The thoughts kept becoming more prevalent, though, so I decided I would make a few changes in my life and maybe I would be good.
[time=493] After making minor changes, I realized I needed something bigger.
[time=497] I needed to fully surrender myself to God.
[time=499] Suddenly, the thoughts of baptism no longer sounded like a bad idea.
[time=503] I could no longer come up with excuses to why I should not give it all up to God.
[time=507] After I made that decision, I changed my life drastically.
[time=510] I changed the people in my life and the steps I was taking.
[time=513] I am no longer living for me, but for the glory of the Lord.
[time=516] I have now decided to take the final step and be baptized.
[time=527] What a great story.
[time=528] It is my honor and privilege as a minister of the Gospel to baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=534] [APPLAUSE]
[time=545] It's Sunshine, right?
[time=547] Sunshine.
[time=548] What a great name.
[time=550] Why don't you show your story?
[time=551] I'm Sunshine Moss.
[time=552] I'm 21 years old.
[time=554] And I'm the youngest of five.
[time=558] I was raised by my mother in Fort Wayne and my father resides in Central Florida.
[time=564] I work part-time as a cashier at least, famous recipe, and I'm a senior at the University of St. Francis pursuing a degree in elementary and special education.
[time=572] I'll be graduating in May 2015.
[time=575] As an infant, I was baptized and I grew up in the church.
[time=579] I attended parochial school from 1st to 10th grade, then I switched to a public high school my junior year.
[time=585] Growing up in the church, I would say that I was a believer and I knew that Christ died from my sins, but I never understood what that meant.
[time=593] My junior of high school, I was challenged by a young man who drove me to school.
[time=597] He often shared the Gospel with me and invited me to prayer meetings before school and FCA meetings during lunch.
[time=604] At this point in my life is where I felt Christ started to knock at the door of my heart and I walked to the door, but I didn't open it.
[time=611] Then time passed by, I ignored the knocking at the door.
[time=614] I finished my senior year of high school and went to college.
[time=617] My freshman, sophomore, and junior years of college were challenging.
[time=620] I struggled with depression, anxiety, and constantly desired approval from my professors, peers, family, and friends.
[time=627] Through these struggles, I would pray to God and ask why me.
[time=630] I saw myself as a good person, I could not understand why God would let bad things happen to me.
[time=635] When I came stagnant in my faith, I continued to go through the motions by going to church every Sunday and I kept acting like I was a Christian girl with my life all put together.
[time=644] In August of 2014, my friend Chris came back from a summer-long evangelization training.
[time=650] Chris shared the bridge diagram with me.
[time=652] This diagram explains the only way to salvation is through faith in Christ.
[time=657] That night, Chris and I talked about how I would receive my salvation and we discussed the steps moving forward.
[time=663] I decided to begin coming to Black Hawk with a group of St. Francis students.
[time=668] I was nervous to come because it was different and I was afraid that I would not be Christian
[time=674] enough.
[time=675] I found out after coming to the church and being a part of the St. Francis group that everyone loved me and accepted me with open arms.
[time=682] On Sunday, September 14, 2014, I came to the first service.
[time=687] We were going through the Live It Out series.
[time=689] During the sermon, two verses were read that would change my life forever.
[time=692] The verses came from 1 Timothy, chapter 1, verses 15 and 16, and it says, "The saying
[time=698] is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
[time=705] sinners of who I am the foremost.
[time=707] But I received mercy for this reason that in as the foremost Jesus Christ might display His perfect patience as an example to those who believe in Him for eternal life.
[time=718] I remember being in awe and thinking if Paul can be saved by Christ's death, so can I.
[time=723] I finally saw that Christ was enough and that I was enough for Christ.
[time=728] We sang these words at the end of the service.
[time=732] My chains are gone.
[time=733] I've been set free.
[time=734] My God, my Savior has rained to me.
[time=737] And like a flood, His mercy reigns, an ending love, amazing grace.
[time=741] On September 14, 2014 is the day I decided to surrender my life and my heart to Christ.
[time=748] Since coming to Christ, I can see major differences in my life.
[time=751] I fix my eyes on the cross and I'm chasing it.
[time=754] I'm actively pursuing a relationship with the Lord and I'm trusting in Him.
[time=757] There are times of struggle where I stumble, but I know this walk will not be easy and that nothing can pluck me from the hand of God.
[time=764] In the days to come, I desire to continue growing in my faith.
[time=767] I want to live to serve God and glorify His name in everything that I do.
[time=772] I want to share the gospel with those who have not heard the good news of Christ.
[time=776] I want to be baptized because I love the Lord with my whole heart and I desire to dedicate my whole life to following Him obediently and living out is calling for my life.
[time=786] Jesus Christ did die to save sinners and I'm so thankful that He did.
[time=801] What a powerful story.
[time=802] Thank you for sharing that with us.
[time=803] It is my honor and privilege as a minister of the gospel to baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=822] Well good morning.
[time=823] If you have your Bibles turned to Luke chapter 22, you know, I'll never tire of hearing about Jesus.
[time=832] I have a Bible minor from Cedarville University, my undergrad, and then I have a Master's of
[time=839] Divinity from the Master's Seminary out in California and I've finished all my coursework
[time=845] of a Doctorate of Ministry at Trinity Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois.
[time=852] And yet all that being said, that's not about me, it's more about I can never come to the
[time=858] end of the beauty and the glory and the majesty of Christ.
[time=868] Someone described it like this one time for me, he said, imagine you're in some sort of super dome, whether that's, you know, the new AT&T stadium down in Dallas and someone gave you a tour of all of that stadium.
[time=880] And coming to the conclusion or what you thought was the conclusion of that tour, there was a door and you opened that door and as you entered into what you thought might have been just a janitor's closet, it opened up into another complete new super dome or AT&T stadium.
[time=899] And it just kept opening up in the new stadiums and you could never come to the end of it.
[time=904] That's what the gospel is like.
[time=906] That's what Christ, who He is and what He's done is like.
[time=911] And so this morning, my goal is to, again, try to show forth the beauty and the glory
[time=918] of Christ.
[time=920] That's what this series, Snapshots of Love is all about, looking at the last days of Christ
[time=927] in His ministry here on earth.
[time=929] And so again, if you have your Bibles, let's turn to Luke chapter 22 and we're going to back up and start in verse 1 as we read God's Word together.
[time=939] Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called the Passover.
[time=943] And the chief priests and scribes were seeking how to put Him Jesus to death, for they feared the people.
[time=949] Then Satan entered into Judas called a scariot who was of the number of the twelve.
[time=955] He went away and conferred with the chief priests and the officers how He might betray Him to them.
[time=960] And they were glad and agreed to give Him money.
[time=963] So He consented and sought an opportunity to betray Him to them in the absence of a crowd.
[time=970] Then came the day of unleavened bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.
[time=974] So Jesus sent Peter and John saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us that we may eat it.
[time=980] They said to Him, 'Where will you have us prepare it?' He said to them, 'Behold, when you've entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you, follow Him into the house that He enters, and tell the master of the house,
[time=993] the teacher says to you, 'Where is the guestroom where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'
[time=1000] And He will show you a large upper room furnished, prepare it there.
[time=1004] And they went and found it just as He had told them and they prepared the Passover.
[time=1008] And when the hour came He reclined at the table and the apostles with Him, and He said to them, 'I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; for
[time=1020] I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.' And He took a cup, and when He had given thanks He said, 'Take this and divide it among yourselves; for I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom comes, kingdom of God comes.' And He took bread, and when He had given thanks He broke it and gave it to them saying, 'This
[time=1046] is my body which is given for you.
[time=1050] Do this in remembrance of Me.' And likewise the cup after they had eaten saying, 'This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood, but behold the hand of Him who betrays me is with me on the table;
[time=1063] where the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed.'
[time=1070] And they began to question one another which of them it could be who was going to do this.
[time=1076] A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest.
[time=1082] And He said to them, 'The kings of the Gentiles exercised lordship over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors, but not so with you rather let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader is the one who serves.
[time=1095] For who is the greater, one who reclines at the table or one who serves?
[time=1101] Is it not the one who reclines at the table?
[time=1104] But I am among you as the one who serves.
[time=1110] You are those who have stayed with Me in my trials, and I assigned to you as my father assigned to me a kingdom that you may eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom, and sit
[time=1120] on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
[time=1125] Let's pray this morning.
[time=1127] Father, what an honor it is for me to talk about you again.
[time=1135] And God, I ask that you would grant the power of your spirit to allow each of us to see your
[time=1144] beauty once again, to be captured by your grace and by your majesty, by your power and by
[time=1153] your purposes.
[time=1154] Oh God, would you do that this morning?
[time=1158] We pray this in Christ's name, amen.
[time=1162] Well three thoughts this morning to help us move through this narrative.
[time=1167] One, we're going to look at the past coming to the present.
[time=1171] Secondly, we'll look at the predetermined sacrifice.
[time=1175] And then third and final, we'll look at the promise of the kingdom.
[time=1179] And so first, the past to the present, verses one through fifteen as we read there, there
[time=1185] is a emphasis there upon the Passover being prepared.
[time=1191] We look at verse one, it says, "The feast of the unlevered bread drew near which is called the Passover." Verse seven, "Then came the day on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed." Verse eight, Jesus said, "Go and prepare the Passover." Verse nine, they responded, "Where will you have us prepare it?" Verse 11, "Where is the guestroom where I may eat the Passover?" Verse 12, "Prepare it there in that room." Verse 13, "And they prepared the Passover." Verse 14, "And when the hour came," verse 15, "I've earnestly desired to eat this Passover."
[time=1229] Nine out of fifteen verses talk about this idea of Passover.
[time=1236] They emphasize this.
[time=1237] So why?
[time=1238] I think in order for us to understand the significance and importance of this feast, specifically
[time=1245] this specific night where Jesus was to have the Passover meal with His disciples in order
[time=1253] for us to understand the significance we need to look into Israel's past and understand
[time=1259] how it comes to the present of Luke 22.
[time=1264] In Exodus chapter 12, we'll take a minute and we'll read this, but if you know Israel's
[time=1270] history they had come and God had come to Abram and had said, "I want to make you a great nation," and he took Abram out of his land and brought him to a new land and made
[time=1282] him a promise there that he would become a great nation and that he would have a land and that all the nations of the world would be blessed in him.
[time=1292] And as Abram became Abraham, the father of many nations, it moves to Isaac and Jacob.
[time=1299] Jacob had a son named Joseph and Joseph was sold by his brothers into slavery and went
[time=1306] to Egypt as a slave and in God's sovereign plan.
[time=1310] Joseph went all the way up to second in command in Egypt and yet because of all of that,
[time=1320] they became slaves in Egypt.
[time=1324] And Moses came on the scene and God decided to use Moses to deliver his people from Egypt.
[time=1331] And so Moses came to Pharaoh and there were the 11 plagues and then here's the 12th plague,
[time=1337] was called the Passover, verse 1 of chapter 12 of Exodus says this, "The Lord said to Moses, 'And Aaron in the land of Egypt, this month shall be for you the beginning of the months.
[time=1348] It shall be the first month of the year for you.
[time=1351] So all the congregation of Israel that on the 10th day, understand the specifics here,
[time=1357] on the 10th day, which is the very day that Luke 22 is happening, on the 10th day of this
[time=1364] month every man shall take a lamb according to their father's house, a lamb for a household.
[time=1370] And if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor shall take according to the number of persons.
[time=1377] According to what each one can eat, you shall make for your count for the lamb.
[time=1382] Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old, you may take it from the sheep or from the goats, and you shall keep it until the 14th day of this month." Sorry, in Luke 22 we're talking about the 14th day of this month.
[time=1396] On the 14th day of the month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill their lambs at twilight, then they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two
[time=1407] doorposts and the lintel of the house in which they eat, they shall eat the flesh that night roasted on the fire with the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs they shall eat it.
[time=1417] Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted, verse 10, "And you shall let none of it remain until the morning, anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.
[time=1426] In this manner you shall eat it with your belt fastened, your sandals on your feet and your
[time=1432] staff in your hand, and you shall eat it in haste, it is the Lord's Passover, for I will
[time=1439] pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast, and in all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment.
[time=1451] I am the Lord." Verse 13, "The blood shall be assigned for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood I will pass over you, no plague will befall you to destroy you when I strike
[time=1464] the land of Egypt." Verse 14 of Exodus 12, "God's instructions to his people this day, the Passover day."
[time=1475] Luke 22, "This day shall be a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the Lord
[time=1482] throughout your generations as a statue forever, you shall keep it as a feast."
[time=1491] From the time of Moses, Jews have celebrated the Passover in the same way.
[time=1500] The celebration is called a seder, it means order in Hebrew.
[time=1505] There's a set order of service that has varied little for more than 3,500 years.
[time=1512] It involved remembering God's redemptive work, inspiring the firstborn son, and also
[time=1519] in redeeming the people of God out of slavery in Egypt to move into the promised land, and
[time=1525] at the center lies the grace of God and his use of the blood of a lamb to redeem his people.
[time=1538] And so all of this history and all of this ritual and all of this memorial would have been front and center in Luke 22 as we read these words about Jesus preparing this meal
[time=1552] and earnestly desiring to eat this Passover meal with his disciples.
[time=1558] The son would have already set, the room would have been lit by candlelight earlier in the afternoon, Peter and John would have gone to the temple, having a lamb with them.
[time=1570] They would have gone along with thousands of people representing all of the homes in
[time=1576] the households in Jerusalem that were called to sacrifice their Passover lamb.
[time=1583] The priest would have ceremonially killed each lamb, sprinkling its blood upon the altar,
[time=1589] and then given the lamb back to the family to take back to their home to be roasted for their Passover dinner.
[time=1595] All over Jerusalem and this night, this was happening in every home, each and every family
[time=1604] participating in the same activities, in the same way with the same words, remembering
[time=1610] what God had done in Exodus.
[time=1614] But in this particular room, in this particular gathering where Jesus and his disciples were,
[time=1624] there would have been such a heightened sense of anticipation for the disciples as all that
[time=1632] Jesus had been saying about this week in Jerusalem would have been on their minds as the hostility
[time=1638] of Jesus' enemies continued to grow and grow and grow and then the cryptic predictions
[time=1645] of Jesus having to die at some time.
[time=1648] All of this would have been in the minds of the disciples as they were preparing to eat
[time=1658] this Passover with Jesus.
[time=1661] This was a very significant night and the timing of all these things coming together
[time=1667] was no coincidence.
[time=1669] And while the Passover meal began the same as every other year, this year's celebration,
[time=1677] in that upper room would change everything.
[time=1681] Christ switches things up.
[time=1685] He does not follow the prescribed order.
[time=1688] Instead, after giving the normal thanks and the first cup of wine, he begins his description
[time=1694] of a new Passover, a description of the events which were about to take place the very next
[time=1702] day, events which would show that he was the true lamb, the true Passover.
[time=1711] And in doing so, he would bring an end to the Passover as it was known.
[time=1717] It was no longer a reminder of God's passing over the firstborn in Egypt.
[time=1721] It was now a reminder of God's passing over all that placed their faith and trust in him.
[time=1730] Their firstborn in Exodus was saved by sacrificing lambs while God's firstborn was about to be
[time=1738] slain to rescue all the sheep who would one day recognize his voice and follow after him.
[time=1746] Look at verse 15, he says, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you."
[time=1755] You see, Jesus wanted to eat this meal with them and say what he was going to say with them and change things up as he was going to change them so that they would begin to better understand the events of the next 24 hours.
[time=1768] He was communicating to them that God was about ready to provide a much greater deliverance,
[time=1775] a much greater salvation with the one lamb of God who would take away the sin of the world.
[time=1784] Notice the finality of Christ's word in verse 16 when he says, "I will not eat this again
[time=1790] until it's fulfilled in the kingdom of God." And verse 18, "I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom comes."
[time=1801] The past of what God had done is now here front and center in the present of this Passover
[time=1807] meal as Jesus was to eat this with his disciples, to bring them into a new reality, into a greater
[time=1818] deliverance.
[time=1821] Understanding the past and how it led to the present Passover leads us to the words of Christ which reveal secondly the predetermined sacrifice.
[time=1831] You see from the beginning of time Christ was planned to be the true Passover lamb.
[time=1837] I just want to quickly draw your attention to four phrases that Christ uses.
[time=1841] The first one's in verse 15, "I've earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before
[time=1848] I suffer." Before I suffer, the predetermined sacrifice in less than 24 hours from when
[time=1860] he spoke those words, the horrific events of Calvary would all be played out as Christ
[time=1868] willingly allows himself to be betrayed.
[time=1872] Look at verse 21, "The betrayer was still in fellowship, his hand was at the table with Jesus.
[time=1879] It's not like Christ just found out who the betrayer was going to be.
[time=1883] He knew all along. No, he willingly allowed himself to be betrayed, to be arrested, beaten,
[time=1890] maligned, whipped, mocked, tortured, executed, and ultimately forsaken by his father as the wrath
[time=1899] of God was spent completely upon him." These events would be and are the most difficult
[time=1910] and horrific events any other human would ever, ever suffer. He took it all.
[time=1917] The second phrase is this, "For you." Happens two times in verse 19 and 20 as
[time=1928] Jesus brings forth this different Passover. He says it in verse 19, "He took bread,
[time=1935] and when he had given thanks, he broke it. He gave it to them, saying, 'This is my body.'"
[time=1942] It wasn't literally his body. It was an illustration of about what was going to happen
[time=1948] that next day, that his body would be broken. But understand this, he says that this is my body
[time=1954] broken for you. Verse 20, "Likewise the cup," after they'd eaten, saying, "This cup that's poured out
[time=1966] for you is the new covenant in my blood, his blood that would be spilt the next day
[time=1972] represented this new covenant that was poured out for you."
[time=1984] If there's any truth that you need to get from the Bible, it's this, that Christ died for your sin.
[time=1994] Plenty of other truths that are excellent and wonderful and will benefit.
[time=2000] But if there's only one truth, understand this, and it's, as a reminder, it's right here on your
[time=2006] hand. Christ died for your sin. It was for you. He said that to the disciples,
[time=2017] "For them to understand that what he was going to do was not only going to benefit them but would
[time=2026] benefit everyone who would place their faith and trust in the sacrifice of the Lamb of God,
[time=2033] Jesus Christ." There's a third phrase, comes in verse 22, about this predetermined sacrifice.
[time=2040] He says, "For the Son of Man goes as it has been determined." All of this is a part of the unfolding of God's redemptive narrative in human history.
[time=2053] This was planned before the foundation of the world. Ephesians 1 says it this way,
[time=2061] in verse 4, "Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world."
[time=2068] Acts chapter 2 says it this way. In this speech, it says this, "Men of Israel hear these words,
[time=2074] Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst. As you yourselves know, this Jesus delivered up according
[time=2086] to the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God." This was not, this was not a fly by the seat of
[time=2096] the pants operation. Christ was orchestrating this exactly according to plan. He had waited to come
[time=2106] to Jerusalem exactly at the Passover time. He knew his betrayer and allowed his betrayer to get
[time=2114] close, even close enough to share fellowship at that Last Supper. He went to a private place where
[time=2122] it would be easy for the guards to come and get him. First he went to the upper room and then the
[time=2128] garden of Gethsemane. He was making it easy for the guards to come and arrest him and on and on
[time=2140] and on. This was exactly according to plan. The last one, the last phrase here in this predetermined
[time=2148] sacrifice. He says, "I am the one among you who serves." The disciples get caught up in this dispute
[time=2156] again about who's the one who's going to betray me and then they start talking about that leads them to this idea of, "Okay, who's the greatest among us?" This wasn't the first time that they had
[time=2166] talked about this. Probably wasn't the last, but Jesus comes back again and gives them that idea of
[time=2173] just this truth. He reminds them of true greatness, that greatness isn't about being first.
[time=2182] It's about serving. He again reminds them that he is the one among them who is about ready to serve
[time=2194] them more than they had ever been served in their entire life. I've said this before and I'll say
[time=2200] it again. Nobody has loved you better or more than Jesus has. No one has served you more than Jesus
[time=2209] has served you. Philippians 2, he says it this way, "Have this attitude in yourselves which was also
[time=2218] in Christ Jesus, who though he was in the form of God, he did not count equality with God,
[time=2224] a thing to be grasped, but he emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the
[time=2233] likeness of men and being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death,
[time=2241] even death on a cross." And he says those very words to his disciples the night before that he was
[time=2250] the one among them who was going to serve. Well understanding the past and how it led up to this
[time=2259] present Passover, Mia leads us to the words of Christ which are so rich that he is the true and
[time=2267] better Passover lamb sacrificed by the plan of the triune God for you, for me, for all who would
[time=2275] place their faith and trust in him. Third and finally the promised kingdom comes in verses 28 through
[time=2283] 30. We've read them already together. While there's great grief in Christ's words, there's also great hope, the hope of the coming kingdom. It's a big topic to discuss in just a few
[time=2296] minutes, but bear with me. Certainly God's kingdom is an everlasting kingdom which spans from eternity
[time=2305] past into forever. And he is the sovereign ruler over all the earth, over space and time,
[time=2313] over all the heavenly beings that will never change. His dominion is from everlasting to everlasting.
[time=2320] And at the same time, his kingdom on earth is already in place and at the same time,
[time=2327] not yet fully realized. His kingdom is already in the place in the sense that those who put their
[time=2336] faith and trust in him have been, as Paul described in Colossians, transferred out of the kingdom of
[time=2342] darkness into the kingdom of his beloved son. There's a new reality there for those who have
[time=2350] placed their faith and trust in Christ to enter into his kingdom. And yet his kingdom is not yet
[time=2358] fully realized in the sense that some of his promises to Israel have yet a future fulfillment
[time=2365] to them. Now there are others who would think differently about this kingdom, but this is what
[time=2371] we teach and I'm okay if people think differently about it, but this is what I believe it means.
[time=2378] The Abrahamic, the Davidic and the new covenant are all yet to be fully fulfilled and the promises
[time=2384] that God made to the people of Israel will indeed fully become true in a future time in what the
[time=2393] Bible calls the Millennial Kingdom. And somehow, somehow with all this going on from
[time=2405] Exodus to the Passover with Jesus to Calvary and his resurrection and into the Millennial
[time=2412] Kingdom and into eternity, somehow there's a lamb that gets in the middle of all of it.
[time=2416] We can never get away from this idea of there's a lamb that is necessary
[time=2423] from Exodus to Calvary to the Millennial Kingdom. Revelation 5 says it this way. In Revelation 4
[time=2431] there's this amazing scene of God's sovereign power on the throne. And in Revelation 5 there
[time=2438] are these scrolls that represent the outworking of God's plan into eternity. And John is able to see
[time=2446] by revelation what is going on in that throne room. And John is there and he's weeping because
[time=2453] there's no one that's found worthy to open up the scrolls. And if no one is able to open up the
[time=2459] scrolls then the very plans of God into eternity would not yet be able to be unfolded.
[time=2465] And yet there's an angel comes in Revelation 5 and says oh stop your weeping John. Behold,
[time=2472] the lion of Judah, the lamb that was slain is worthy to open the scrolls and to see the whole
[time=2485] plan of God unfolded into eternity. How did a lamb get there? It shows up again.
[time=2492] This lamb of God. The same when that John the Baptist said behold the lamb of God who takes away
[time=2504] the sin of the world is the same land in Revelation 5 who is worthy to open the scrolls and have
[time=2510] the whole redemptive plan of God work out into eternity. It just keeps going. Revelation 19
[time=2519] the marriage supper of the lamb. When the bride of Christ the church is there and ready to be
[time=2527] presented to Christ himself. And then that very next chapter in Revelation 20 describes this
[time=2534] millennial kingdom which is what I believe he's talking about in the end of Luke 22.
[time=2539] You are those who stayed with me in my trials and I assigned to you as my father assigned to me a kingdom that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the 12
[time=2551] tribes of Israel. You see in the millennial kingdom the apostles are going to rule with Christ but
[time=2557] not only that the Old Testament states the New Testament believers, martyred believers
[time=2563] from the millennial kingdom in Revelation 20 it says from the tribulation time.
[time=2568] And then in Revelation 21 as the millennial kingdom gets worked out says this and I saw no
[time=2576] temple in the city for its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the lamb and the city has no need
[time=2582] of sun or moon to shine on it for the glory of God gives it light and its lamp is the lamb.
[time=2589] Revelation 22 the last chapter of the Bible the angels showed me the river of the water of light
[time=2595] bright as crystal flowing from the throne of God and of the land no longer will there be anything a curse but the throne of God and the lamb will be in it.
[time=2604] You see this promise here and what Christ was doing with his disciples in that room was not
[time=2616] just helping them understand what was going to unfold in those next 24 hours but also what was
[time=2623] going to unfold for the rest of eternity as Christ would rise from the dead and he will rule
[time=2630] and reign on an earthly throne in this millennial kingdom and then enter into a new heavens and new
[time=2637] earth where the lamb will still be central we'll never get away we'll never want to get away
[time=2645] from the Lamb of God Jesus Christ.
[time=2649] Understanding the past and how it led up to the present Passover meal leads us to the words of
[time=2657] Christ which reveal that he's the true and better Passover lamb sacrificed by the predetermined plan
[time=2665] of the triune God from eternity past and finally it's the Passover lamb who will rule and reign on
[time=2671] the throne of David and Israel and his saints with him in the millennial kingdom and on into eternity.
[time=2678] You know at the beginning of this message I encourage us all let's just look and dive deeper
[time=2686] into Jesus and when we do from this passage what do we see? Well Mike Bolmore a pastor of mine said
[time=2695] this about this very passage what do we see he said I see our Savior in complete control
[time=2702] there's no crisis here he's not afraid here he's not intimidated he's in charge he knows who will
[time=2712] betray him he knows the moment of his betrayal he knows the hour has come for him to lay down
[time=2718] his life and he is willingly eagerly laying it down for us.
[time=2723] There's only one thing for us to say in response to this
[time=2732] Christ died for our sins thank you Jesus
[time=2739] what a great Savior you are thank you Jesus what can I render
[time=2750] because of all that you've done for me let's pray this morning God thank you so much
[time=2761] for that night what great significance as you began to unfold this new Passover this this new
[time=2772] sacrifice this much greater deliverance and the promise of a coming kingdom
