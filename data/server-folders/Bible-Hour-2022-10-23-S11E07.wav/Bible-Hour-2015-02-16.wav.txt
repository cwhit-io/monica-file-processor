[time=0] You
[time=30] [MUSIC - 1094 seconds]
[time=1152] Well, just the voices now. How great, how great is our God. Sing with me. How great is our God. And all we see. How great. How great is our God.
[time=1180] How great is our God. Sing with me. How great is our God. And all we see. How great. How great is our God.
[time=1208] Good morning. Welcome. If this is your, come on you can greet me a little better than that. Good morning.
[time=1224] I'll greet you the same way I did our Sunday school class first hour. The truth is about perspective is that today is about 30 to 35 degrees warmer than it was on Thursday.
[time=1237] This is the day the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it.
[time=1242] We are in, for those of you that are first time visitors with us, we are in the midst of a four days, the last four days of the life of Christ out of the book of Luke.
[time=1252] Luke chapter 20 through 22, easy for me to say. Luke chapter 22 and on.
[time=1261] If those of you that don't know who in the world I am, I'm an elder here. I've had the privilege of teaching some recently here and have been around for a long time.
[time=1271] My wife Diane and our three sons Caleb Josh and Zach have been around here for some time. I actually realized this week that it was 29 years ago this February, this month, that I walked into the sanctuary, which is the old gym across the street, 29 years ago for the first time in my life, ever stepping into this place.
[time=1297] And I'm thankful for what it's meant to me and my family.
[time=1302] I want to tie in just a little bit last week from Josh. If you look at Luke chapter 22, have your Bibles open there.
[time=1309] You can't miss the interwoven connectivity of past Passover to the present Passover that Jesus brings to bear in this section.
[time=1323] He walked us through last week, the city of Jerusalem would have been in full swing.
[time=1329] Some places, some historians talk about the fact that there might have been six, five to six times the number of people come into that town during that time for the Passover.
[time=1343] It's a boom in place. And he had a predetermined sacrifice. Josh talked about in chapter 22, verse 15.
[time=1353] I've eagerly desired to eat this Passover you before I suffer. Jump down to verse 19. This is my body, which is broken for you.
[time=1368] This is my blood, which is poured out for you in verse 20.
[time=1373] Then in response to the dispute among them, in verse 24, Luke says in chapter 22, verse 27, "I am among you as one who serves, and then he tells them the promise of a greater kingdom."
[time=1392] And so it's right in the heart of this where they just got through him experiencing and sharing, revolutionizing what the Passover looked like.
[time=1403] And immediately from that, he talks about his betrayal, and they start saying, "Well, is it me? It's not me. It's not me."
[time=1411] And they immediately transition to this concept of who's greater in the kingdom, who's greater in the kingdom.
[time=1420] And that's where we land at verse 31. And Peter, Simon, gets addressed by Jesus. But before we go there, pray with me. Will you please?
[time=1440] You reign. Glory in the highest, you reign, Father. You are the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.
[time=1453] You are sovereign. We're just saying it.
[time=1460] I've got to pray that my study, that the words of my mouth, my meditations, that your word would be empowered by you, Holy Spirit, to make a difference.
[time=1471] And that it would be illuminated in a way that brings confidence and comfort, and life changed to us, Father.
[time=1481] May you be glorified today in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1487] We're going to look at these three snapshots today. These four days we've talked about these hashtags and snapshots of love.
[time=1494] We're going to look at three of them today. The first one is Jesus is the perfect advocate standing in between for us.
[time=1502] The next one, Jesus being the perfect teacher on prayer.
[time=1507] And then finally, Jesus being the perfect picture of submission.
[time=1514] So jump right in with me at verse 31. Verse 31 says, Simon, Simon.
[time=1521] And the interesting thing is Jesus has not called Simon, Simon, in over 10 chapters, 15 chapters.
[time=1532] It actually goes all the way back to chapter 5 and 6 and 7.
[time=1538] And Jesus says Simon, Simon. Remember, they're coming off this conversation.
[time=1545] And if you've done much study on who Simon was, Simon was a guy that wasn't the one to sit in the bat.
[time=1552] Simon Peter, let me say it that way. Peter was not the one to sit in silence.
[time=1557] If it was on his mind, most likely it was what? Coming out his mouth.
[time=1563] And that's where we land with Peter.
[time=1565] Peter was talking with the rest of the disciples and they're talking about who's the greatest.
[time=1570] And you get this passionate thing from Jesus that looks at him and he goes back to his name.
[time=1579] And he says, Simon, Simon. Satan has, depending on your version, Satan has demanded to sift you like wheat.
[time=1589] And that phrase, Simon, Simon, is the equivalent of you that have had children or you that have had a good friend that have made a mistake.
[time=1598] Or that not made a mistake that have just had consequences come into your life and things go on.
[time=1604] And it's the equivalent of saying, like my mom used to say to me, "Oh, Richard, Lynn."
[time=1613] There's Josh and I talked about it this week. Oh, Josh, I wish it was different.
[time=1622] He had some difficulty that happened with his scholarship this week.
[time=1627] And you get to that spot and you say, "Oh, it's a term of endearment.
[time=1632] It's a term, oh, Simon, Simon." And the word Satan has asked to sift you as wheat.
[time=1642] The truth is, is it's not just Simon. Some of your versions will say it.
[time=1647] And if you look at Matthew 26 or Mark 14, it actually says all of you. Satan has demanded.
[time=1656] And there's a couple of words that we're going to talk about today. This is the first one demanded or he has asked, it's demanded.
[time=1664] That word is a really, really strong word. And it only comes into play once in the whole New Testament.
[time=1672] Right here by Luke, this Gospel writer, detailed that doesn't fall into place anywhere else.
[time=1681] Satan has demanded to sift you like wheat.
[time=1686] Your first bulletin point is, is Jesus is a fully aware advocate. And if you think about that, there is nothing.
[time=1695] This interaction in the upcoming activities of Peter is just like Webby said a couple weeks ago about where they were going to go
[time=1703] and they needed to find a place for the Passover. God doesn't get freaked out. Surprise.
[time=1708] Oh, no, where are we going to go? Where are we going to do the Passover at? God's not getting freaked out here.
[time=1714] God is fully sovereign even over this spot in Peter's scenario. Fully.
[time=1722] If you're familiar with the passage from Job, Job, if you go to Job chapter 1 verses 6 to 12, it's not going to come up on the screen.
[time=1731] But there is a concept that Satan, Satan has none, zero, zip, not a authority that doesn't come through the Father's hands.
[time=1743] Same thing here. Same thing here. Satan demanded Satan ask whatever and that's where we get to.
[time=1752] And he doesn't get the authority to deal with any of the twelve disciples, any of them, including Peter without going through God's authority.
[time=1765] Jesus is as Colossians in Hebrews said, he is the image of the invisible God, the exact representation of his being.
[time=1774] He is full deity and he is fully aware in Peter's life and the disciples what's coming up.
[time=1784] And remember what that is. Stuff is just right now in this passage starting to blow up. It is going to blow up.
[time=1797] He has full knowledge. That bullet point, number eight, letter A there, verse 31 and 32, God has full authority over Satan, Jesus as well.
[time=1807] Look at verse 33, verse 32 and 33, "I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail."
[time=1817] That is the perfect advocate Jesus that says, "I'm going to stand in the gap. There's going to be something that goes on.
[time=1825] There's going to be something that goes on. But don't be concerned because I've already went before you that your faith will not fail."
[time=1834] He's in that way. He's interceding on our behalf in a way that our faith won't fail.
[time=1840] And then he says, when you turn back, the guy that gets sideways, that's so confident, he tells him a real clear statement.
[time=1852] "Peter, when you turn back, encourage your brothers."
[time=1859] Because you know what? Everybody in the next 24 or 48 hours is going to go, "Oh my goodness, what is going on?"
[time=1871] He prayed for all of them, and Peter specifically that his faith would not fail, and then he tells you what to do when he turns back.
[time=1881] God was fully in control. You catch that, right? This thing with Peter, this wasn't outside of the knowledge of God.
[time=1892] We are so often, like Job's friends, and presumed that they knew why Job was suffering and were so bold as to declare the thoughts of God about Job's suffering.
[time=1908] That's a difficult spot. We often look at it, and we look at Peter's things, and we all focus on Peter.
[time=1916] We focus on Peter being so bold and screwing up, flat out.
[time=1923] That's what typically comes to your thoughts when you think about this section about Peter.
[time=1929] That he was so bold as to say not me. But I want to submit to you when you look at Joseph's difficulties at the hands of his brothers.
[time=1943] Genesis says what others meant for evil, God meant for what? Good.
[time=1951] You look at Daniel. You look at Daniel, and he ends up in a pretty precarious position with a bunch of hungry lions, right?
[time=1962] It doesn't really look all that positive a place to be.
[time=1968] We look at the negative side of Peter's denial, and Judas Betrayal, and forgetting that 100% of it is all within the knowledge and plan and fulfillment of God's design.
[time=1985] A betrayal, and a denial, and inside of God's plan, wait a second.
[time=1995] There is nothing, nothing that happens outside the knowledge and the plan of God, the sovereignty that we just sang about.
[time=2005] Sovereign over everything. We just sang it. Our friend Stephen Maria Gardner down here a long, long time ago, 1985 it was I found out this week, wrote a song that I was 21 years old at the time.
[time=2024] 21 years old, trying to find my way with God, and this song came to me this Monday morning as I'm preparing for this, and it hasn't been out of my mind all week.
[time=2037] 30 years ago, he wrote a song, and it's called "Nothing will happen to me today, nothing good, nothing bad, nothing will happen to me today without passing through my father's hands."
[time=2053] Period. God is sovereign. He's not surprised, he doesn't freak out, and he didn't do it with Peter, and he doesn't do it with you.
[time=2066] Nothing happens without passing through your father's hands.
[time=2071] So maybe you're as confident as Peter was. Listen to what he says. He says, "Lord," in verse 33, "Lord, I am ready to go with prison with you, and even to death."
[time=2083] And Jesus answered, "Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times that you know me."
[time=2093] So maybe you're as bold as Peter thinking that you know how a circumstance in your life is going to work out.
[time=2102] Be careful.
[time=2106] James says, "Be careful what you say you're going to do a year from now, or here, and I'm going to go here and I'm going to go there. Be careful."
[time=2113] Peter was really bold. "No way, I'm not betraying you."
[time=2123] Chad Burch shared something with us this week about Tim Keller and these thoughts about worry and fear.
[time=2131] Maybe you're operating in fear that God might get some situation or some circumstance wrong.
[time=2142] Maybe you're worried or fearful that God's not going to get it right.
[time=2147] That's a lie from hell, folks. God gets it right all the time. He never misses.
[time=2154] Or maybe you are in the position that you're hurt because you think he's already got it wrong in some circumstance.
[time=2169] Maybe that's you. Maybe you're paralyzed by the fear that he's going to get it wrong.
[time=2173] Others of you are already paralyzed by the bitterness and the anger and the frustration that actually he did get it wrong in this area of your life.
[time=2182] With your health, with your marriage, with your children, with your job.
[time=2186] If you fill in the blank, we're just saying it. Sovereign over everything. No accidents.
[time=2200] So when we look at it, that first snapshot, that first picture of Portrait of Christ, he is the perfect advocate always interceding on your behalf, the disciples' behalf.
[time=2215] Peter's behalf for our good. No accidents. God's not surprised. That's the snapshot. Jesus, the perfect advocate.
[time=2228] Let's look at verses 35 and through 37 here. Jesus transitions to this thought that when Jesus asked them, when I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?
[time=2244] He was always providing. Nothing they answered. Nothing.
[time=2250] He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it. Also a bag. And if you have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one if you don't have a sword."
[time=2258] It is written and he was numbered with the transgressors. And I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me.
[time=2264] Yes, what is written about me is reaching fulfillment. Remember what we just said from Josh last week?
[time=2273] My body, which is broken for you. I won't take again of the bread or the cup until the kingdom of God is at hand.
[time=2283] All of that. They hear. They see. And now he tells them, "Oh, by the way, take your backpack with you. And if you've got a coat, sell your coat if you need to to get a sword so that prophecy could be fulfilled."
[time=2304] Jesus was all about that. Your second bulletin point there is Jesus' life fulfills all Scripture.
[time=2313] Depending on who you look at or who you read or how you compile it, there are hundreds.
[time=2322] You fill in the number, hundreds of prophecies of Scripture that portray everything describing where he was going to be born, born of a virgin, all of those things.
[time=2334] And every one of them is about him fulfilling prophecy. Even this one that he would be numbered among the transgressors that just happens in a short time.
[time=2349] He says, "Yes, what has written about me is reaching its fulfillment." The disciples said, "See, Lord, here's two swords. We got them." He said, "That's enough. We're good. We don't need a bunch of swords. We're not going to battle here."
[time=2365] Every detail of this Passover time was to fulfill Scripture prophecy about the Messiah.
[time=2372] Luke 24, 44, after his resurrection, he actually comes back to them and he said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you."
[time=2382] Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalm. Everything.
[time=2390] But it was becoming very real, very real.
[time=2396] Now he's saying, "Guys, last time we were eating this Passover, I'm going to die."
[time=2406] And it becomes to a spot where they don't have a choice but to follow.
[time=2415] Now we get to the spot in verses 39 to 46, 39 through 46, and we talk about Jesus' life pattern as prayer.
[time=2429] Verse 39, "Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.
[time=2435] On reaching the place he said to them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation." He went through from them about a stone stroll, knelt down and prayed, "Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me, yet not my will, but yours be done."
[time=2454] An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him, and being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.
[time=2465] When he arose from prayer and went back to disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.
[time=2473] "Why are you sleeping?" he asked. "Get up and pray so that you won't fall into temptation."
[time=2483] When you look at Jesus' life pattern, look at verse 39. He says, "Jesus went out, depending on your version, as was his custom, or as usual to the Mount of Olives."
[time=2497] You look back, Luke 5, 16 says, "But Jesus often referred, often withdrew to lonely places and prayed."
[time=2505] Luke 6, 12, one of those days Jesus went to a mountainside to pray and spent the night praying to God.
[time=2518] 9, 28, about eight days after they went to a place, Jesus took Peter, John, and James with him, and he went up on a mountain to pray.
[time=2527] Luke 11, one day Jesus was praying in a certain place when he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray."
[time=2538] When you talk about a life pattern of prayer, you can't miss it with Christ.
[time=2546] Even to the point that he went up to the Mount of Olives all the time.
[time=2551] If you want to flip over to Matthew 6, that's the spot where we're going to look at the Lord's Prayer, the disciples' prayer, how he taught us to model to pray.
[time=2561] Matthew 6, verse 19, 9 through 13, "Our Father in Heaven, how would be your name?
[time=2570] Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[time=2577] Give us today our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we have also forgiven our debtors, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one."
[time=2590] Interesting, when you look at those passages of what he set right there, when he gave his model prayer, and now what you even hear him praying in the garden.
[time=2606] A stone stroke, now some of you probably can throw a stone a whole lot further than I can, but the truth is in the quietness of a garden, a stone stroke isn't quiet that far.
[time=2618] And if you look at Matthew 26 and mark, it's pretty clear that they heard what Jesus was praying.
[time=2628] They would have also heard the passion with which he prayed it.
[time=2637] Do you believe that?
[time=2640] We had a lady this morning just in the dialogue class this morning, even as she read a scripture, began to be moved with emotion.
[time=2650] Don't miss the emotion of God, Jesus Christ, in this spot, when he says the phrases like, "Father, if you are willing, take this cup, not my will, but yours be done."
[time=2668] Look at the phrases. He says, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation." He tells the disciples to do that. He tells them that twice.
[time=2676] "Go pray that you won't fall into temptation." He prays from his own, "Not my will, but yours be done."
[time=2685] Really, really clear.
[time=2689] He is the perfect teacher on prayer.
[time=2692] That's that second portrait. If you want to learn about praying, just go read a little bit about Jesus and what he did.
[time=2701] Put yourself in a posture, in a place, in a regular position of prayer, so that you can be still and be quiet before him.
[time=2713] His knowledge of the events ahead that he must actually face was totally consistent with the knowledge that he just demonstrated about Peter.
[time=2725] That fourth bullet point is Jesus modeled submission to the Father.
[time=2731] And you think about what he knew. You think about what he knew from the foundation of his foreknowledge about he would be betrayed, denied, mocked, beaten, ridiculed, spit, spit on, unjustly accused, and ultimately crucified.
[time=2759] And he says, Mark 26 and Mark 14 and Mark Matthew 26 say this way, "My soul is overwhelmed to the point of death."
[time=2775] You think about the heavy things that you've had happen in your own life and how it has felt such a weight on your shoulders.
[time=2785] And then think about how clueless you are to what Jesus felt.
[time=2796] He knew what was coming and he says he's overwhelmed to the point of death and he gets to this spot and he says, "My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, yet not my will, but yours."
[time=2816] And I'll confess to you today how easy it is and even the circumstances of my life this week that I want Rick's will to be done.
[time=2831] You want your will to be done. If there was ever a time that Jesus didn't want to was willing to do this, he got to that spot.
[time=2842] The Passover always contained a bitter portion. As a reminder of the deliverance out of Egypt and here Jesus is taking the cup of wrath.
[time=2853] He is taking the cup of wrath driven by the need to provide deliverance for a whole people.
[time=2861] For you and for me, it's a cup of the sin wrath that is born by every one of us that you can't pay yourself.
[time=2872] That's him. That's him.
[time=2878] Even in agony, he prayed fervently. I really do believe this. Here's the second word that's only ever used one time in the Scriptures, in the New Testament.
[time=2893] It's Luke, by the way. If you don't know, Luke was a physician. So when you get to a physician describing like drops of blood, my guess is that he knew what he was talking about.
[time=2908] It's a reasonable, confident thing. That word that says drops of blood occurs one time used by a physician to describe the agony that Jesus was going through, even to death.
[time=2927] And I do believe this. This is a real thing and I have a hard time pronouncing it, so I'll just try to say it this way.
[time=2934] Hamadidrosis, it's a real thing from stress, from strain. You can Google it. There's pictures of people where there's blood coming out of their pores. It's real.
[time=2949] Out of his anguish. And it was for you and it was for me.
[time=2961] The last snapshot of love there is Jesus is the perfect picture of submission.
[time=2971] As I wrap up here, I'm going to have Marcel and the team come up. When you think about that first snapshot, that first portrait of Jesus being the perfect advocate, he's standing in the gap for you.
[time=2986] What does it look like for us to trust God to be our perfect advocate in all circumstances? In all circumstances, whether they appear positive or negative? See, we're all really quick and really, really easily.
[time=3003] Really, really easily convinced that just because something looks negative, that it can't be of God.
[time=3014] Just because it has some negative circumstances to it, we think that it's not of God. That's garbage.
[time=3024] I've even learned to pray differently in the last few years because I do not.
[time=3031] I don't want to pray for any one of you in a way that removes circumstances that are negative, but are circumstances that God wants to have in your life so it produces the results that he wants.
[time=3047] We're all too quick to be like Job's friends that says, "Oh, wait a second, Job. You lost everything. You must not be doing this God thing right."
[time=3060] Sorry, folks. Nothing will happen good or bad. And just because it appears bad, don't make the assumption that God's not in the midst of it.
[time=3077] Maybe you're operating from that description I said before of fear and anxiety that God might not get things right in your life or in a situation.
[time=3087] Or maybe you're actually convinced that God already did miss it in your life.
[time=3093] The next snapshot is Jesus as a teacher of prayer. I'm going to challenge you.
[time=3098] To create a pattern of prayer in your life that is as obvious as it was to Jesus onlookers.
[time=3106] You know how obvious it was? Judish knew where to take the betrayers because he knew Jesus was going to be praying there.
[time=3115] The Mount of Olives.
[time=3118] A time, a place, even a thought pattern. Not vain repetition or many words, but sincere connecting with God.
[time=3131] And then finally, Jesus is the perfect picture of submission.
[time=3136] What is it in your life?
[time=3141] What is it in your life that you need to willingly submit to God?
[time=3153] Wholeheartedly submit to him. In a way that says God, I want your way in my life, my family, my church, not my agenda.
[time=3169] Because be reminded God doesn't get freaked out. Let's sing.
[time=3184] [MUSIC - 29 seconds]
[time=3228] Father in heaven. How Lord be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be turned on earth as it is.
