[time=597] >> Well, good morning. Welcome to the Bible Hour. My name is Steve Webster. I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries. We are so glad that you're watching, that you're part of our church family. We love that you're watching. We long to have feedback from you. How are we doing? Things we should do. Things we can do better. We're grateful.
[time=616] You're watching in the morning on Sunday before we have our official gathering time. We meet in community groups at nine o'clock hour here on campus and we have a 1031 service gathering. So there's still time on Sunday morning for you to come and physically be with us. We ask you to do that quite a bit. And if you're able to do it, we'd love to see you in person here. And when you come, tell us that you're watching. Please give us, again, that feedback that we long to receive from you.
[time=645] We're excited about all that we're experiencing here and we won't long for you to be a part of it. We long to connect with you in all kinds of ways. We're interested in connecting on social media. We'd encourage you to follow us in that way.
[time=660] It's never been easier to connect with people. Social media has a lot of weaknesses, but this is a strength is it really does connect person to person. So on Facebook, on Twitter, and Instagram, we would encourage you to follow us there. And to really follow along with things we'd like to do.
[time=674] We follow along with things that are going on. Right now, in particular, we're in a series called Four Days and we've encouraged people to use a hashtag called Snapshots of Love.
[time=684] So it's just a hashtag, the pound symbol, Snapshots of Love. We have aspired in this series in the days leading up to Easter to encourage people to walk in Jesus footsteps and to serve other people like he came to serve us.
[time=699] He didn't come as one that wanted to be served. He came as one serving and the ultimate act of that service was his action of giving his life as a ransom for us. So as we are in our community serving alongside other people, we'd encourage you to let us know about that.
[time=716] Not in a way that you're making much of yourself, but in a way that you're connecting with us. You're going to hear this morning about Peter, for example, as we're tracing through the days leading up to the resurrection of Jesus. Peter has a very bad night.
[time=728] But that night doesn't need to define him and we can resonate with and rejoice in the fact that we don't need to be defined by the worst moments of our lives.
[time=739] So I can't wait for you to hear that from us this morning. We would encourage you to come on April 11th to a night of improv.
[time=748] Our untold ministries is a ministry that does sketch and improvisational comedy. Among other things, they serve us in the drama department here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=758] We're doing a night of sketch improv comedy on our North Campus at seven o'clock in the asylum on that side of the street.
[time=765] We would encourage you to come and be a part to $5 ticket to get in that money is going to be collected to raise money for video production for them because it's a great need.
[time=773] The untold ministries has, we would encourage you to come and be a part of that and be part of it in that way.
[time=781] Tarzan is our annual spring musical and I've heard our director, Rich Liddick, he talked about this with as much, if not more, enthusiasm as anything that they've done in years past.
[time=793] They have distinguished themselves in our community. They have a wonderful reputation and we would love for you to come and be a part of that.
[time=799] It's $8 for adults and $6 for students, that's March 20th and 21st coming up fast, don't miss it.
[time=808] We'd also encourage you, if you'd like to be a part of sponsorship of the Bible Hour, as you've been a part of our family again for these many, many years, we're so glad that you have.
[time=817] We would love to offer you the opportunity to remember a loved one with a spot at the beginning and the end of the broadcast that highlights an anniversary, a birthday that commemorates a loss or just a celebration of someone in your family, a loved one.
[time=833] We'd encourage you to be a part of that as a tangible way to give back to a ministry that perhaps has given you a lot of encouragement over the years.
[time=840] Thank you for watching. Thank you for being a part of our family. We encourage you to come be with us if you can and above all else, have a great week and God bless.
[time=851] This song, this table, we taught this to you two weeks ago and it's really kind of a communion song. You sing it when you do communion.
[time=863] I was reading and John MacArthur did a sermon on communion and I thought, I want to sing this song even though we're not taking communion, there's got to be something.
[time=879] Here's what he said. He had four points about communion. He said, first of all, we remember why we do it.
[time=886] Remember, Christ's saving work on the cross. I'm not going to get into detail. I just want to help us out as we sing this song, even though we're not physically taking communion.
[time=895] Second, we see the common partaking of Christ's presence as we do it. Third, it is here that we commune with each other as saints.
[time=906] And then fourth, there's a sense in which we come to the Lord's table to worship in the holiest of place. I know we're not taking communion today.
[time=917] But as we sing this song, I want us to partake in the meaning or the essence of communion and what it's about.
[time=930] It's really should penetrate our hearts and lives whether we're taking it or not all the time.
[time=937] So we're talking about piecing at the table. And I love the song too.
[time=942] So let's partake in the essence and meaning of communion as we sing this song.
[time=953] I will feast at the table of the Lord. I will feast at the table of the Lord.
[time=965] I won't hunger anymore at His table.
[time=976] I will feast at the table of the Lord. I will feast at the table of the Lord.
[time=989] I won't hunger anymore at His table.
[time=1004] I will feast at the table of the Lord.
[time=1026] There is peace at the table of the Lord. There is peace at the table of the Lord.
[time=1038] I won't worry anymore at His table.
[time=1048] There is healing at the table of the Lord. There is healing at the table of the Lord.
[time=1061] I won't suffer anymore at His table.
[time=1071] Come on, here weary, come and fight. You shake His easy, His bread and blood.
[time=1083] He is able, He will restore at the table of the Lord.
[time=1098] And oh, He has a place for me. Oh, a joy, my will, my heart.
[time=1109] With the saints around the mercy sea of God.
[time=1120] Come on, here weary, come and fight. You shake His easy, His bread and blood.
[time=1132] He is able, He will restore at the table of the Lord.
[time=1144] I'm invited to the table of the Lord.
[time=1164] I'm invited to the table of the Lord. He says come just as you are at His table.
[time=1188] We are going to be Luke 22 this morning, starting about verse 47.
[time=1199] In the early days of World War II, even before the United States got involved, during the London Blitz, things were terrible for families living in the city because it was an industrial center and so the Germans were very keen on bombing industrial centers.
[time=1217] And so there was a wide campaign to send children from London to the north country far out of harm's way.
[time=1228] As story is told of four of those children from a little out of the way place called Finchley who went to go stay in this mansion in the north country in England far out of the targets of the bombing raids.
[time=1243] And on in this story, these four kids come to live in a mansion with the professor.
[time=1249] And at one point in time, the littlest one wanders throughout this massive house and finds a wardrobe.
[time=1257] And in the wardrobe she finds a portal to a magical land called Narnia.
[time=1263] Eventually her siblings follow her to Narnia. There's four kids altogether.
[time=1269] The one nearest to her's name is Edmond. And Edmond, upon Edmond's trip through the wardrobe, he meets a witch.
[time=1276] And the witch, as witches do, be witches him with sweeties, with tales of what's called Turkish delight, which is actually gross, but our British friends like it a great deal.
[time=1288] And Edmond liked it a whole lot, Turkish delight.
[time=1292] So if there are any fans in the room, if I offend you, I apologize.
[time=1295] Send your emails to Jesse. If you like Turkish delight.
[time=1298] Turkish delight was the promise given to Edmond by the witch.
[time=1303] If you will bring your siblings to me, she says to him, I'll give you all the Turkish delight you could possibly want.
[time=1313] I might replace Turkish delight in my telling of the story with those rise and rolls, some ship shawanna.
[time=1318] That would be much closer to what I would write.
[time=1322] If you don't know what that's about, come see me after service, you won't regret it. Rise and roll some ships shawanna.
[time=1329] Edmond follows through, and the siblings follow him into Narnia.
[time=1335] And he eventually arranged a scenario where he brings his siblings to the witch.
[time=1343] And he falls foul of the witch, as you would expect. Things don't go very well for Edmond.
[time=1350] And when the lion king of Narnia, whose name is Aslan, discovers what's gone on,
[time=1357] the Edmond has betrayed him to the white witch.
[time=1361] He says, "I will stand in your place."
[time=1367] It eventually gives his life that Edmond would be freed.
[time=1371] Only a friend can betray a friend.
[time=1376] This morning is the part of the story in Luke 22 regarding the arrest, the betrayal, and the beginning of the trial of Jesus.
[time=1387] And I know that some of you in this room this morning have experienced betrayal.
[time=1392] And betrayal is always personal.
[time=1396] What strikes me about this story, what strikes me about Jesus' experience is that he enters into all of it with his eyes wide open.
[time=1405] There's a statement I'll have you jot down.
[time=1407] I was thinking this week with the other guys in the teaching team about there's a statement that hovers over the things that we've talked about already the last few weeks and things that we will talk about.
[time=1417] And I would encourage you to jot this down in your bulletins this morning.
[time=1422] This, I think, captures the essence of what we're about to experience again.
[time=1427] Jesus comes as the sovereign suffering servant to do for us what we could not do for ourselves.
[time=1438] That is the story.
[time=1440] That is the message of this four days.
[time=1442] All these snapshots of love.
[time=1445] All those Polaroid pictures you saw a minute ago.
[time=1449] Behind all of them is that picture.
[time=1452] That he has come as the sovereign suffering servant. He's the one he knows all things.
[time=1457] He's entered into evenness to his own betrayal when he chooses Judas to be one of the twelve.
[time=1463] All four gospels accord that he's the one that would betray him.
[time=1466] He didn't make a bad choice.
[time=1468] I didn't see that coming.
[time=1470] He chooses Judas with this in mind.
[time=1473] He does it because he has set his face to Jerusalem.
[time=1478] He's going there to give his life.
[time=1480] That's why he came into the world.
[time=1482] As the sovereign suffering servant to do for us what we could not do for ourselves.
[time=1487] We could not escape the power of sin and death ourselves and you can't this morning.
[time=1492] Some of you have been trying.
[time=1494] And your bulletins are going to be three major takeaways for you today.
[time=1498] And I want to stop for a minute as we start and say this to you.
[time=1502] Please don't hear us say this morning that if you do these three things this week well enough,
[time=1508] perhaps God will grant you entrance into his kingdom or give you a seat at his table.
[time=1514] That is not what we're saying.
[time=1516] We want to follow the example of Jesus.
[time=1518] And Jesse's right whosoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
[time=1524] We believe that this morning.
[time=1526] And if you've never crossed over from death to life, from darkness to light,
[time=1532] pray today will be the day of your salvation that you would follow Jesus.
[time=1536] And these things friends flow out of faith.
[time=1538] They don't flow into faith.
[time=1540] I want to encourage you at that this morning.
[time=1542] So please don't misunderstand today.
[time=1544] We're going to be in Luke 22 starting in verse 47.
[time=1546] Let's read our passage and then we'll just talk about it for a few minutes.
[time=1550] Starting in verse 47, Luke 22.
[time=1555] While he was still speaking, the Hebrew refers to Jesus and what he said.
[time=1560] What Rick talked with you about last week.
[time=1562] While he was still speaking, there came a crowd.
[time=1566] And the man called Judas, one of the 12, was leading them.
[time=1570] He drew near to Jesus to kiss him.
[time=1574] But Jesus said to him, Judas, would you betray the son of man with a kiss?
[time=1580] And when those who were around him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?
[time=1585] And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
[time=1590] But Jesus said, no more of this and touched his ear and healed him.
[time=1595] Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come out against him.
[time=1601] Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs?
[time=1606] When I was with you day by day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me.
[time=1611] But this is your hour and the power of darkness.
[time=1616] Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house.
[time=1621] And Peter was following at a distance.
[time=1624] And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them.
[time=1630] Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said,
[time=1636] this man also was with him.
[time=1638] But he denied it, saying, woman, I do not know him.
[time=1643] A little later, someone else saw him and said, you also are one of them.
[time=1648] But Peter said, man, I am not.
[time=1651] And after an interval of about an hour, still another insisted, saying,
[time=1657] certainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.
[time=1664] But Peter said, man, I don't know what you are talking about.
[time=1668] And immediately while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.
[time=1673] And the Lord turned and looked at Peter.
[time=1676] And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.
[time=1684] And he went out and wept bitterly.
[time=1688] Would you pray with me?
[time=1691] Father, I pray that you would go before us today.
[time=1694] I'm not equal to this task, God.
[time=1698] There is nothing in my words alone that will bring life and salvation today.
[time=1703] But in your word, God, there is.
[time=1707] In the footsteps of Jesus, God, we're walking in those footsteps in this story.
[time=1711] And I pray that as we do, that your Holy Spirit would be active in drawing people to yourself today.
[time=1718] Thank you, God, for what we've learned, what we are learning, for the transformative life-giving power of your word.
[time=1724] God, may we hear from you today ask all those things in Jesus' name.
[time=1729] [AMEN] Look at verse 47, this text is very closely tied to what's happened before.
[time=1736] You know, while he was still speaking, he was talking about why are you sleeping, rise and pray that you may not enter temptation.
[time=1743] He's trying to prepare the disciples for what's to come.
[time=1748] And this crowd shows up, and I was just struck this week by this striking lack of self-awareness and a mob mentality.
[time=1756] It just gets away from them.
[time=1758] I mean, don't they see it's nighttime, there's clubs, there's torches.
[time=1763] They never stop and say, this is probably not a good idea.
[time=1766] Like, nothing good happens in this scenario.
[time=1770] Night time, clubs, swords, torches.
[time=1773] Let's get him.
[time=1776] They just don't even see it.
[time=1779] If you are inclined to mark in your Bible's friends, I'm always a little shy to encourage you to do that, but if you do, several things to draw your attention to today.
[time=1787] Look at verse 47.
[time=1789] There's a man called Judas, he is described as one of the twelve.
[time=1794] If you underline that, please, one of the twelve.
[time=1797] All betrayal is personal.
[time=1802] He wasn't just somebody.
[time=1806] Edmund was willing to sell out his siblings to get what he wanted.
[time=1811] Luke's gospel doesn't tell us this, other gospels do, but things go very badly for Judas after this point, as you might imagine.
[time=1819] Judas is lost faith.
[time=1821] He doesn't see the point of what he's doing.
[time=1825] I've come to give my life away, he says over and over again to the disciples, he just doesn't see it. He does not see it.
[time=1833] Judas is leading them, do you see that in verse 47?
[time=1835] He's leading them, but he's not in charge.
[time=1839] He thinks he is, all shoya, and the kiss, by the way, coming up is just a way for him to identify Jesus in the darkness, because they would otherwise be able to see him.
[time=1849] It was a common way to greet your teacher, but also intensely personal, as you might imagine.
[time=1854] He's out front, by the way, he's not reluctant.
[time=1858] He's not shuffling his feet, he's making a beeline for Jesus, verse 48.
[time=1865] But Jesus said to him, Judas, I can imagine the sadness in his voice.
[time=1873] Judas, this is Jesus' favorite self-expression.
[time=1877] He calls himself the son of man, goes to Daniel 7.
[time=1880] Write that reference down somewhere in your notes, if you wouldn't mind.
[time=1883] Daniel 7, 13, and 14, we won't go to this morning, but this is what the son of man means there.
[time=1888] It means he's coming in the clouds of heaven that all authority is given to him.
[time=1893] This is how he refers to himself more than any other title.
[time=1897] This is how Christ refers to himself.
[time=1900] Judas does not understand this about Jesus.
[time=1906] He doesn't see him for who he is.
[time=1909] How could he?
[time=1913] Jesus is completely aware of what's going on.
[time=1917] Jesus calls Judas to be his disciple all the way back in Luke 6.
[time=1921] I mentioned that earlier.
[time=1922] It says in Luke 6, 16, who became a traitor of Judas.
[time=1927] He chose him with his eyes wide open.
[time=1931] Luke's account doesn't even go all the way to say that they actually do kiss.
[time=1935] They kind of gets in the way.
[time=1936] Verse 49, take a look.
[time=1939] When those who were around him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we strike with
[time=1946] the sword?
[time=1947] Now in verse 38, remember from last week it's revealed that they had two swords.
[time=1950] That was enough.
[time=1951] They weren't a militia.
[time=1952] They weren't calling out.
[time=1953] They were going to have an armed confrontation on the Mount of Olives.
[time=1957] But two swords was enough to just, there's going to be danger.
[time=1960] He's going to be hurt.
[time=1961] And so that's enough to provide the most basic sense of okay, if something goes wrong, this
[time=1967] will be enough.
[time=1969] The disciples begin to figure out what's going on.
[time=1971] Okay.
[time=1972] Here comes, oh, the light bulbs are going on.
[time=1976] And then they go out pretty quickly, tragically.
[time=1980] What Jesus told them would happen over and over again in Luke chapter 9.
[time=1985] And Luke chapter 18 is now happening.
[time=1987] I'm going to Jerusalem, you guys.
[time=1990] I will be betrayed.
[time=1991] I will be beaten.
[time=1992] I will be mocked.
[time=1993] I'll be killed.
[time=1994] And I'll rise again.
[time=1995] It's beginning.
[time=1996] They don't see it.
[time=2001] We tend to be pretty hard on the disciples.
[time=2004] Like, guys, he was with you.
[time=2007] You were in the boat, literally, in the boat with him.
[time=2012] While the storm ceases, what are you doing?
[time=2017] How could you not see him for who he is?
[time=2020] And then I think about myself.
[time=2023] I leave our gatherings on Sundays and I'm home.
[time=2027] And I lose sight.
[time=2028] I forget.
[time=2031] I'm a forgetful person, friends.
[time=2033] I don't know if you've had that experience either, but my goodness.
[time=2040] Verse 50, take a look.
[time=2042] One of them, Luke doesn't say who it is.
[time=2046] John, I think John likes to throw Peter under the bus.
[time=2050] So the apostle John says it's Peter.
[time=2053] There's also a fun little detail there in John's gospel at the resurrection where they have a foot race to the tomb.
[time=2058] Remember this?
[time=2060] And John goes, I got there first.
[time=2062] He just kind of mentions it.
[time=2063] So I think John likes giving Peter a hard time.
[time=2067] So John says it's Peter.
[time=2069] No one, he's the most likely candidate to do this, of course, because Peter's always waving a sword around anyway, all kinds of different stuff.
[time=2078] So it's Peter.
[time=2080] One of them struck the server to the high priest and cut off his right ear.
[time=2084] John tells us to serve his name, his name's Malchus.
[time=2086] He's a person.
[time=2089] The specificity of what's going on here is amazing to me.
[time=2091] It's his right ear.
[time=2096] Luke talked to eyewitnesses, remember from chapter 1, the first four verses, he tells you what his gospel is about.
[time=2104] I wonder if he mentions Malchus.
[time=2106] I wonder if John mentions Malchus because he was known to the early believers.
[time=2111] I like to believe that Malchus became a follower of Christ.
[time=2116] I have no proof of that.
[time=2118] I like to believe it, though, because of what happens in verse 51.
[time=2124] G.C. is Malchus is a person.
[time=2127] Not merely an adversary, but Jesus said, no more of this.
[time=2133] See, he's in charge.
[time=2135] Everything is out of control, seemingly, and in one minute, it's not.
[time=2141] No more of this.
[time=2143] Peter enough, he reaches out, he touches his ear and healed him.
[time=2153] Compassion, the first takeaway this morning, friends, in your notes is to show compassion.
[time=2160] In the hardest circumstances, we, like every family, there are days when everything is
[time=2166] going well and wide open roads and there are days when there's lots of stuff in the way.
[time=2173] My daughter turned 12 this week, past week, and we are doing our best to navigate those
[time=2181] things together, but it's hard to show compassion because you lose sight.
[time=2187] Yeah, but everything's going sideways, everything's so crazy, not for Jesus.
[time=2193] Look at Colossians 3, 12 through 16.
[time=2198] These are Paul's words to the church at Colossae.
[time=2201] Put on, then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, Colossians
[time=2207] 3, 12, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another, and if one has a
[time=2215] complaint against another, forgiving each other, as the Lord has forgiven you so you also must
[time=2223] forgive.
[time=2224] There's a question also in your notes that I would point to you as well.
[time=2228] It's this.
[time=2229] Do you see people like Jesus does?
[time=2232] This is an invitation just to consider, friends, we're in the preparation season, and so it's an invitation to kind of reorient yourself, to get focused.
[time=2241] Do you see people like Jesus does?
[time=2243] You see, His mouth just has a person, a person worthy of His compassion.
[time=2248] At the worst possible moment, His face is still set toward Jerusalem.
[time=2257] By the way, I'm just, I'm also struck in verse 51, it's just very casual.
[time=2262] He touched his ear and healed them.
[time=2265] That's what you come to expect from Jesus, that you can do these kind of things.
[time=2269] And then when verse 52 happens, and I just shake my head, then Jesus said to the chief
[time=2275] priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come out against Him, have you come out as against a robber, as an outlaw, one translation says, with swords and clubs, that
[time=2286] there's no mention of the healing at all, like did they not see it?
[time=2291] I mean, Malchus's ear is attached, detached, reattached, that's pretty amazing.
[time=2299] And they don't say anything about it.
[time=2302] It's this mob mentality, it's insanity.
[time=2306] They've lost sight entirely of Jesus.
[time=2310] He is the enemy, we're going to destroy him, period, that's it.
[time=2314] They even miss the miracle right in front of them.
[time=2317] Malchus, poor Malchus is bleeding, it's hemorrhaging, and all of a sudden he's not anymore.
[time=2324] And just, just roll right past it.
[time=2325] I'm amazed by that.
[time=2327] I'm amazed at what's not said here.
[time=2329] All four gospels tell us this happened, all four of them, and they just steam roll right
[time=2336] through it.
[time=2337] It's terrifying, isn't it?
[time=2340] A robber with swords and clubs is mob mentality, it's just, when I was with you, verse 53 in
[time=2348] the temple courts day after day, you did not lay hands on me.
[time=2353] I wasn't sneaking around.
[time=2356] I was with you day after day in the temple, I was right in front of you.
[time=2361] This is your hour and the power of darkness.
[time=2364] The second takeaway in your notes friends is to keep perspective.
[time=2369] And I would ask the question, are your eyes open?
[time=2374] When you get discouraged, when I get discouraged, I take my eyes, my eyes do this.
[time=2379] When I run very infrequently, all too infrequently, when I run, when I'm here, I'm okay, but when
[time=2387] I get tired, my eyes start to go, and then I, you lose perspective.
[time=2393] When Paul prays in Ephesians chapter 1, he prays that the eyes of their hearts would be enlightened, that you would see Jesus for who he actually is.
[time=2403] Let's look at that together, this is Ephesians chapter 1 starting in verse 16.
[time=2412] Are your eyes open?
[time=2413] Have you missed Jesus?
[time=2414] Because when you get discouraged, it's easy to miss him, because your eyes aren't looking to the hills, where your help comes from, your eyes, or I sag.
[time=2424] I do not cease to give thanks for you, Ephesians 1, 16, remembering you in my prayers.
[time=2429] The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the spirit of wisdom
[time=2435] and revelation and the knowledge of him, having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you
[time=2442] may know what is the hope to which he has called you.
[time=2446] What are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe according to the working of his great might,
[time=2458] that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and
[time=2468] above every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in the one to come.
[time=2474] We miss Jesus, we miss him, that's who he really is.
[time=2480] He is the one at the right hand of the Father, all dominion, all power, all authority is his forever and ever, amen.
[time=2490] All things under his feet it says in Ephesians 1, 22, but this is your hour Jesus says in
[time=2497] the power of darkness.
[time=2500] This is your hour, it should be chilling reading this, look at verse 54.
[time=2510] Then they seized him, again steamrolling right back, this is your hour of the power of the darkest, they seized him.
[time=2517] Look at all these verbs in 54, they seized him, they let him away, they brought him to the high priest's house, very intentional, gospel writers love to pile verbs on in that
[time=2527] way to make sure it's, like when Jesus goes away to pray, he gets up, he goes away, he
[time=2533] leaves, it says.
[time=2536] And this is at the other end of the spectrum, they seized him, they let him away, they brought him to the high priest's house, very, very intentional.
[time=2543] This is Caiaphas' house, he's been high priest for about 18 years, so he was the man in charge,
[time=2549] his father in law, Anis, is still around, other gospels tell his story, Luke does not.
[time=2556] What are the last few words there of verse 54?
[time=2562] Go ahead and say them out loud.
[time=2565] One, two, three, it's go again, one, two, three, go, at a distance.
[time=2574] Peter was following, I just couldn't get that phrase out of my head this week.
[time=2578] He was following at a distance.
[time=2583] You preachers will ask this question, are you following at a distance?
[time=2591] Are you counting the cost?
[time=2593] Peter was afraid.
[time=2594] He watched his rabbi led away by a mob, and he was lacking self-awareness to be sure,
[time=2603] but he got that attachment to Jesus meant danger, and so he was keeping his distance.
[time=2612] I couldn't help but wonder if you are too.
[time=2616] Verse 55, when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together,
[time=2622] Peter sat down among them, like what was he thinking here?
[time=2626] He's at a distance, but now he's right in the middle.
[time=2629] Nobody will notice, surely.
[time=2633] It's amazing how he thought he could escape the notice, but how could he escape the words of Jesus?
[time=2639] Nobody can.
[time=2641] I thought back the last week, maybe the week before.
[time=2645] It was the last week, Rick, verse 30, 32, that you last week or is that the week before?
[time=2651] Yeah.
[time=2653] Look at verse 31 of Luke 22, "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to have you to have
[time=2666] you, that he may sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you, that your faith may
[time=2672] not fail, and when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers."
[time=2681] Jesus has come as the sovereign, suffering servant to do for us, could not do for ourselves.
[time=2688] He sees three steps ahead of Peter.
[time=2693] He says, "Well, I'll never do that, Lord, I'll never deny you, I'll never fall away." Well Peter, when you fall away, you'll be, look, you'll fall away, you'll be restored,
[time=2703] and after your restoration, you'll strengthen the brothers.
[time=2706] That's how far ahead he is of you.
[time=2713] You can't see what's going to happen tomorrow.
[time=2715] He's already in tomorrow.
[time=2716] He's already in Thursday.
[time=2721] Simon, I've prayed for you.
[time=2723] You will fall away.
[time=2724] You say you won't, but you will, and then you're going to be restored, Simon, and then you will strengthen other people because of your suffering, because of your struggle.
[time=2734] Wow.
[time=2736] Then a servant girl, verse 56, "Seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely
[time=2742] at him," she's just kind of cocking her head a little bit.
[time=2747] This man also was with him.
[time=2750] He denied it saying, "Woman, I don't know him." That's not what she said.
[time=2754] He said, "You are with him." He goes, "Father, I don't even know him." Lies do that, don't they?
[time=2760] They stack up on you.
[time=2763] One lie begets another, begets another.
[time=2766] Peter's exaggerating.
[time=2770] A little later someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them." Peter said, "Man, I'm not."
[time=2780] After an interval of about an hour, what do I Luke said that?
[time=2787] I'm not sure.
[time=2789] I speculate this.
[time=2792] Peter had bad moments here, really bad moments.
[time=2796] An hour's past is enough time to say, "Oh, man, what have I done?"
[time=2802] An hour has passed.
[time=2803] He sobered up a little bit.
[time=2809] Still another insisted saying, "Certainly this man also was with him, for he too is a
[time=2816] Galilean that's stacking up now.
[time=2818] This is the most specific and emphatic accusation.
[time=2821] You're a Galilean.
[time=2823] He insists, certainly you are." Other gospel writers say that Peter now begins to curse and swear.
[time=2829] Luke doesn't, Peter loses it.
[time=2834] "Man, I don't know what you're talking about." That's beyond not knowing him, he's like, "What do you mean?"
[time=2843] Verse 60, "The rooster is drawing breath, even as Peter says those words."
[time=2849] He's ready to go.
[time=2852] Finally, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.
[time=2860] I missed this at some point along the way.
[time=2862] The Lord turned and looked at Peter.
[time=2864] That's his striking, isn't it?
[time=2867] Make eye contact.
[time=2870] Peter has tried to escape the gaze of Jesus and he can't.
[time=2874] He couldn't escape his words, he can't escape his gaze and neither can you.
[time=2881] You think you're off the map.
[time=2882] You think you've gone too far, he can't find you.
[time=2884] It's not true.
[time=2886] This is the worst moment of Peter's life, by a long shot.
[time=2890] He's had some bad moments, some really bad moments.
[time=2893] All Peter's flaws are on display, you know, the Bible doesn't tuck him away.
[time=2898] He's cutting people's ears off, you know, he flies off of the mouth.
[time=2904] On this rock, I will found my church, Jesus says, "Wow, really?
[time=2908] I could find some better rocks than this guy, but that's what Jesus says."
[time=2914] You are not defined by the worst moments of your life.
[time=2918] What God says about you trumps what you think about you.
[time=2921] Write it down.
[time=2924] What God says about you trumps what you think about yourself.
[time=2927] I'm a failure, I'm a nobody, I'll never get it right.
[time=2935] The Bible says, "If you're in Christ, you're in new creation, your son, your daughter, you're in air." Do you believe it?
[time=2947] Peter's sorrow is real, verse 62.
[time=2950] He goes out and he weeps bitterly.
[time=2952] He remembers the words of Jesus in verse 61.
[time=2955] He remembers.
[time=2956] That's the third take away from this morning.
[time=2960] Always remember, Peter forgot.
[time=2966] Always remember and I added a couple of words here, I think they're new notes.
[time=2968] Always remember and, is there an "and" there for you guys?
[time=2972] No?
[time=2973] Yes?
[time=2974] Anybody?
[time=2975] And forget.
[time=2976] Remember and forget.
[time=2977] What do you mean, Steve?
[time=2978] Well, I'm glad you asked.
[time=2980] To forget, there are things you need to bury under the grace of God.
[time=2987] God says, "Of your forgiven sin, I will remember it no more." Can you conceive of that?
[time=2991] I can't conceive of that, because people wrong me and I would say, "I forgive you," but it's there, right?
[time=2998] Not for God.
[time=3000] I will remember your sins no more.
[time=3002] There are things, guys, there are hurts, there are betrayals in your life, you've got to leave them there, you've got to leave them behind and press out into the full wide ocean
[time=3010] of the grace of God.
[time=3012] A couple of quotes from Philippiansy as the team comes back up this morning, we're going to sing in response, Philippiansy said this, "How easily we forget that the church was
[time=3027] founded by disciples who betrayed their master.
[time=3031] None was willing to stand by Jesus as the religious and political authorities condemned him to death at his moment of greatest need, the disciples fled in the darkness.
[time=3041] The boldest of the lot, Peter, was the very one who cursed and denied him three times
[time=3047] before the cock crew.
[time=3049] It was for traders that Jesus died.
[time=3054] He goes on and says this, "I hope you have yours to hear this, friends.
[time=3058] God does not love us because of who we are and what we have done, but because of who God is." Grace flows to all who accept it.
[time=3069] Jesus forgave an adulterous, a thief on the cross, a disciple who had denied ever knowing him.
[time=3075] Grace is absolute, all encompassing.
[time=3078] It extends even to people who nailed Jesus to the cross.
[time=3082] Father, forgive them for they don't know what they're doing.
[time=3085] We're among the last words he spoke on earth.
[time=3090] That grace is available to you today because grace is greater than all of your sin.
[time=3095] I know that your debt is significant.
[time=3097] I know mine is too.
[time=3100] And I encourage you this morning to sing with your whole heart today.
[time=3104] We'll be down here after the service to elders, myself.
[time=3108] We'll be down here to pray with you if you need to pray.
[time=3112] Maybe you've forgotten who he is and you need to remember.
[time=3116] Maybe you don't sow compassion like Jesus does.
[time=3117] Maybe you've lost perspective.
[time=3119] We want to pray with you about that this morning.
[time=3121] Let's sing in response with our hearts full and our eyes open.
[time=3127] Let's sing together and sing all creatures of our God and King.
[time=3146] Give up your voice and with a sing, O praise him, hallelujah.
[time=3165] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=3309] Hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=3324] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=3420] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=3436] Jesus come as the sovereign suffering servant to do for you what you could not do for yourself.
[time=3459] You can be compassionate because he was compassionate.
[time=3464] You can have perspective because he set his eyes to Jerusalem.
[time=3470] And finally this morning, you and I together cannot lose heart because he is who he says
[time=3480] he is.
[time=3481] I offer that to you this morning, we're going to be down in front of your elders, their wives down here this morning, if you need to pray, if that hallelujah is a cold and
[time=3491] broken hallelujah today, come and pray, just come seek God's faith with us.
[time=3496] We'll listen, we love you, let's pray.
[time=3503] God we forget, we learn like Peter we don't remember, and guide those eyes, those eyes
[time=3512] that locked on Peter's or eyes that were gentle and kind.
[time=3520] And those same eyes, God, look out from the word that the spirit enlightened this morning
[time=3526] and they look at each one of us in a pray that your spirit would draw men to yourself today.
[time=3531] The people in this room, God, within the sound of my voice would respond in faith Jesus.
[time=3537] God, thank you for your son is and what he came to do.
[time=3542] Thank you that we can have perspective, God that we can remember and that we can be compassionate
[time=3549] because of all the things that he's done, we can't do him on our own.
[time=3553] Go before us God, as we leave this place, keep us safe in the snow, thank you for the reminder that the snow is, of the new nature that you give us in the person of Jesus and his name we pray, with great thanksgiving, amen.
[time=3579] .
