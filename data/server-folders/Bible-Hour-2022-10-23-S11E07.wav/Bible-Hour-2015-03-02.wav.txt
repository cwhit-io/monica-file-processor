[time=0] You
[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=60] Well, good morning, everybody. My name is Steve Webster. I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries. Thank you for watching. Thank you for being part of our family. We really do see you as part of our family. And we love getting to share this with you week by week and to be a part of your lives. Thank you for being part of our family and for allowing us to be a blessing to you over the years. We take it very seriously and we're grateful that you're watching. If you're watching on Sunday,
[time=90] today morning, you have time to come join us. We've made some changes in the new year that we have a nine o'clock community hour and a 10, 30 gathering time. So there's still time for you to come and be with us. Over the years, we've asked you many times to come and to see us. Let us know that you're watching. Let us know how we can do better and let us know how we've been a blessing.
[time=110] Indeed, that's our prayer that we have been, how we've been a blessing to you. We encourage you on that front. Coming up in the month of April is a new series that we're calling unashamed. And it's a story. It's a story about a story. It's a series about the gospel. The gospel is an announcement that God has come in the person of Jesus to do for us, but we could not do for ourselves.
[time=137] You've heard us laying the seeds for that little bit in the four day series. And now we're going to talk about what it means for a person to come and to know for the first time that that is true.
[time=147] What a marvelous thing to know that God has done for us in Jesus as a substitute for our sins that he's given his life in our place. What a marvelous thing. So we're going to invite you to enter into that story and to tell us how it is that you've come to know Christ.
[time=163] There's a place for you to go on our website that you can log on and tell us how you came to know him. Knowing about him is different than knowing him. We want to hear from you how you've come to know him and how you have come to have your sins forgiven by him.
[time=179] There's no greater joy that we have than sharing that with people. That is a reality that we can invite you into that God has done this for you. So we would love to hear your story. Nothing gives us more joy and to share that with you and for you to share that with us.
[time=194] So please log on and share that story with us if you would please. And so as you connect with us on our website you can also connect with us on the internet at Facebook, Twitter and Instagram need some help ask your kids.
[time=208] They can help they can help you figure out how to get signed up and his follow along. It's a way for you to communicate with us and for us to communicate with you. We're going through this four days series. We've got a few more weeks there and we're asking you to use that hashtag snap shots of love. You can do that on those different social media platforms.
[time=225] There's also a way for you if you've been watching the Bible hour for many many years we invite you to consider a monthly membership and what we're calling the Founders Club. There are different tiers to that membership and different ways for you to partner with us as we endeavor week by week to work hard to that gospel I just mentioned
[time=242] to getting the word out to people all over our region so what a wonderful thing that is and again if you've been a part of watching and part of our family for these many years, consider a monthly membership in our Founders Club again at different levels please call that number if you have any questions.
[time=257] There's also a possibility for you an opportunity for you to sponsor an individual episode of the Bible hour. We would love to give you the opportunity as you support this ministry to have an opening minute at the beginning and end of the Bible hour broadcast. We remember a loved one, an anniversary, someone that's passed on a birthday. It's a way for you to partner with us and for us to give you a chance to express your love for someone in your family for a spouse for a child.
[time=286] So we love to give you that opportunity and love to have you come alongside us and sponsor us as we consider ways that we can do better on this for what we can't do without you and we wouldn't want to.
[time=297] So thanks for watching this morning. Thanks for all that you do to help us to do this week by week. We take it very seriously as I said and count it as a great joy.
[time=306] So have a great week and God bless you.
[time=336] [MUSIC - 138 seconds]
[time=479] Good morning everybody. We were out in a valley yesterday with all of Fort Wayne.
[time=485] Apparently everyone left their house yesterday and we're all in the exact same place that we were.
[time=492] It's people with their windows down. It's like 38 degrees outside.
[time=497] I don't even know what's going on with that, but I'm excited that it's not two degrees. Are you excited about that too? All right. That's good.
[time=507] If you see Curtis Smith around, I know he's probably still in Haiti. He's down there in Haiti, but if you saw, if you see him in the coming week, you can thank him for the weather warming up.
[time=516] He takes personal credit for the weather being good and deflects blame if it's not so good, so I love to give him a hard time about that.
[time=524] I'm glad you all are here today. I'm so grateful that you're here joining us for the dedication of these kids, and I want to reiterate what Kathy said us a minute ago.
[time=534] I can remember when our kids were dedicated many years ago, too many years ago.
[time=539] Baby dedication here for the Church of Blackhawk is coming alongside the family and us making a covenant, making a promise that we're going to come alongside you and dedicate ourselves to being a blessing to you.
[time=552] Raising kids is hard. Raising kids in the 21st century is harder still.
[time=558] So that's our promise, and that's the dedication that we made when we prayed those prayers a minute ago, is that we're going to come alongside you and be a ministry and be a blessing to you.
[time=567] So thank you for coming and for visiting with us today. Thank you for being here. We hope that you're encouraged by what you hear.
[time=572] We are in a series leading up to Easter Sunday called Four Days. We began on the day before the day of the crucifixion at the Last Supper, which is Thursday evening of the week.
[time=585] And we're working our way through Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Four days. What a four days it was, to be sure.
[time=593] This morning we're jumping into Luke 22 and starting about verse 63 so you can open your Bibles. There are some notes in the bulletin. If you want to take a look at those as well.
[time=603] While you're turning this morning, you've no doubt at this point either heard of the movie or the book American Sniper.
[time=614] Anybody heard of the book or the movie American Sniper? A lot of you out there have heard of it. $474 million. It has grossed to this point.
[time=623] It's the highest grossing war movie in American history. We make a lot of war movies in America. We have a lot of things to be proud of in the way that our soldiers conduct themselves.
[time=633] American Sniper, he's the most decorated sniper in American history. We've had a few of those. He's by far the most decorated.
[time=644] When he came back home, like many of our soldiers in recent days, post-traumatic stress is now part of his life.
[time=652] He dedicated himself to serving other people, helping other soldiers who face post-traumatic stress to make it through, to find some light in what is increasingly a difficult thing to live with.
[time=666] Living in the light of what they experience is a very difficult thing. Part of that responsibility he took upon himself was to reach out to a young man that was like him experiencing post-traumatic stress.
[time=679] He went with him to a shooting range and was murdered by this young man. The young man who murdered him has recently been found guilty at trial and another moving down the line.
[time=691] We have a remarkable emotional response to this story. This man who dedicated his life to serving other people first in the military and then after his military career, serving others who were in harm's way.
[time=704] And $474 million has been grossed because of this movie. It's been a remarkable response to the book and then the movie that followed after it.
[time=713] This man suffered and was killed as an innocent man. And we have this remarkable outpouring, this remarkable emotional response.
[time=724] The story is a difficult one even to wrap our heads around. And we connect with this innocent sufferer and the family he's left behind, tragically.
[time=736] Friends, I want to offer you this, this morning. This is in your bulletins as our guiding sort of statement for the series that we're in.
[time=747] Jesus comes as the sovereign suffering servant to do for us what we could not do for ourselves.
[time=760] Jesus comes as the sovereign suffering servant to do for us what we could not do for ourselves. That's the guiding principle throughout these four days, these weeks leading up to Easter.
[time=773] If you connected emotionally with this story of an American serviceman serving other people, I invite you to connect emotionally also with this man, this man from Nazareth, who came not to be served, but to serve, to give his life as a ransom for many.
[time=793] That's the story, friends, that we've entered into. That's the mindset we invite you to take as we approach Resurrection Sunday.
[time=803] This is a remarkable story and I invite you in this morning to it with us, Luke 22 starting in verse 63.
[time=813] Let me read this story and then we'll talk about it for a minute. We're going to read all the way down to chapter 23, verse 5.
[time=822] Before I start reading, I'll give you some context.
[time=826] A little rewind of the last several weeks in case you're just joining us.
[time=831] The night before he is crucified, before he's killed, before he's murdered,
[time=837] Jesus has dinner with his disciples. At that dinner he says he invites him to re-imagine virtually everything in light of himself.
[time=845] That's going to happen the next day. They go out to a place they would often go to pray to the Mount of Olives, and once he's there, one of his disciples having decided to betray him to the authorities brings a mob.
[time=856] They arrest him and are now carrying him away, having already been arrested.
[time=861] That's where we find ourselves in verse 63. Maybe you're heading in your Bible says Jesus is mocked. That's what mine says.
[time=868] So we are jumping into a rather frightful scene this morning. The men who were holding Jesus, Luke 22, 63, in custody were mocking him as they beat him.
[time=880] They also blindfolded him and kept asking him, "Prophesy, who is it that struck you?" And they said many other things against him blaspheming him.
[time=891] When day came the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, they led him away to their counsel and they said, "If you are the Messiah, if you are the Christ, tell us."
[time=904] He said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe. And if I ask you, you won't answer. But from now on, the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God."
[time=916] So they all said, "Are you the Son of God then?" He said to them, "You say that I am."
[time=923] They said, "What for the testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips."
[time=929] The whole company of them arose and brought him to Pilate.
[time=933] And they began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar and saying that he himself is Messiah Christ, a king."
[time=945] And Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" And he answered him, "You have said so."
[time=952] Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, "I invite you to underline this under Bibles if you are so inclined. I find no guilt in this man."
[time=964] But they were urgent, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea from Galilee even to this place."
[time=976] Jesus comes as the sovereign suffering servant to do for us what we couldn't do for ourselves.
[time=985] He's endured the suffering, friends. None of his suffering is meaningless.
[time=992] Because he suffers on behalf, because the innocent, Jesus, suffers on behalf of the guilty, you and I, none of your suffering is meaningless.
[time=1003] It seems that way, doesn't it? Why is this happening? How could this be?
[time=1010] And I invite you to frame your suffering through the lens of Jesus' suffering.
[time=1019] The most powerful demonstration of the love of God is the suffering and death of Jesus Christ on your behalf.
[time=1025] That is exactly why he has come.
[time=1028] And that's good news, friends. I know that in this world we need good news.
[time=1033] Spring is coming. That's good news. But it won't be spring forever.
[time=1039] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.
[time=1046] Verse 63 says, "The men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking him as they beat him."
[time=1052] They mocked him. They made fun of him. That's what that word means. They ridiculed him.
[time=1056] They mocked him. Look at all these verbs. They were holding him. They were mocking him as they beat him.
[time=1062] They blindfolded him as they kept asking him, "Prophesy."
[time=1068] Because the prophet, of course, would know those things. So he didn't pass their test.
[time=1073] What are your expectations of Jesus? He didn't meet their expectations.
[time=1079] So I'm going to blindfold you. I'll hit you in the face. Tell me who hits you. He didn't do that.
[time=1084] You're no prophet. I wonder if our expectations of him meet those or they're different than that.
[time=1094] Are you frustrated that he hasn't done what you want him to do? They were. You're no prophet.
[time=1104] He passed their fake test. He'll be accused here, verse 65, of blasphemy later on.
[time=1113] Here he is the object of blasphemy. The blasphemed is to slander, to disrespect, to speak disrespectfully.
[time=1121] Ah, that's what they were doing to him. A couple of passes here from Luke 7.
[time=1127] I don't know if they'll be on the screen before you're not. I'm starting in Luke 7, verse 11.
[time=1130] If you want to turn back there with me a few pages to the left in your Bibles.
[time=1136] Luke 11, Luke 7, I'm sorry, verse 11. "Prophesy," they say.
[time=1142] This is a story from Luke 7. It says, "Soon afterward, verse 11, Luke 7, he went to a town called Nane.
[time=1147] The disciples and a great crowd went with them. As he drew near to the gate of the town, behold a man who had died was being carried out. The only son of his mother, and she was a widow.
[time=1157] And a considerable crowd from the town was with her.
[time=1161] And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, "Do not weep. I'll pause for a moment." None of your suffering is meaningless.
[time=1174] And all of it matters to Jesus. It matters to him here. It matters today.
[time=1180] He came up and touched the beer, the thing he was lying on, and the bearer stood still.
[time=1185] "Come on, man, I say to you, arise, and the dead man set up." Amazing.
[time=1191] And began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother, gave him to his mother, and fear seized them all in the glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us." God has visited his people.
[time=1208] That's who he really is.
[time=1211] The soldiers hit him in the face having blindfolded him.
[time=1214] They say, "You're no prophet. The people don't know better." And a dead man sits up and begins talking. They say, "This is who he really is." In your outline, friends, here's our first point this morning.
[time=1228] I just encourage you with this.
[time=1230] Jesus has come as our prophet. He is our prophet.
[time=1236] He knows you fully.
[time=1242] He knows us fully. He is our prophet who knows us fully.
[time=1246] He's not immune to any of it. He speaks on God's behalf as God in flesh, walking around.
[time=1253] A great prophet is among us. He knows us.
[time=1256] He knows that I've lost. I love it. It says that he gave him to his mother.
[time=1263] He knows her. He never met before, maybe.
[time=1269] Later on in Luke 7, there's a story about him reclining at table at one of the Pharisees house.
[time=1274] And Luke 7, 37 says, "A woman of the city who was a sinner."
[time=1281] When she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisees house, bought and brought an alabaster flask of ointment, extraordinarily expensive.
[time=1290] And standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.
[time=1298] Now in the Pharisees who had invited him, saw this, said to himself, "This man were a prophet. He would have known who and what sort of woman this was.
[time=1305] Who was touching him? For she is a sinner." And he is answering it, said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you, and Simon should have set up at that point. I have something to say to you.
[time=1318] He should have been like, "Whoa." But he's smug, say it teacher.
[time=1323] Bring it, he says.
[time=1326] Be careful.
[time=1328] When he has something to say to you, I hope you give him your full attention and that you're not smug about it.
[time=1335] You're no prophet. A prophet wouldn't let a woman do that to him.
[time=1339] Jesus did not pass the Pharisees' fake test.
[time=1343] You don't do what I want you to do, so you're no prophet.
[time=1347] If there really is a God, these things wouldn't happen.
[time=1352] We all hear that often, don't we?
[time=1356] We throw these tests out and God doesn't pass our tests that we construct and that we devise and say, "There's no God. God doesn't care about me." I invite you to have his eyes here.
[time=1371] Verse 66, we're now back to Luke 23.
[time=1379] When day came are the first three words of chapter 23.
[time=1385] Verse 66, "They've been at it all night." That's a bad sign.
[time=1391] I told you guys last week that when the crowd comes with torches in the middle of the night, the mob, bad sign.
[time=1398] This trial's going on, also middle of the night, bad sign.
[time=1403] Bad sign. This is your hour, he says, in the power of darkness.
[time=1406] It's the morning now. In Zacharias, in Luke chapter 1, calls Jesus the dawn of the morning.
[time=1415] He faces more of the hour of darkness that he spoke about last night.
[time=1421] Verse 67 says, "If you are the Christ, tell us they have led him away to their counsel." He said to them, "If I tell you, you won't believe.
[time=1434] And if I ask you, you won't answer.
[time=1438] Those who require proof or demonstration to believe won't be satisfied no matter what evidence is offered.
[time=1444] Prove it while I was hallucinating.
[time=1446] Prove it while I was distracted.
[time=1450] Proof is a flimsy thing, guys.
[time=1453] It's a loose thing. It's hard to prove things.
[time=1457] I was talking with Rick this morning about Easter and about the evidence regarding the risen Jesus.
[time=1463] It's overwhelming evidence, but I can't prove it to you.
[time=1467] I can't prove that he rose from that, but I can give you a whole lot of things to demonstrate that he really actually did.
[time=1473] So when your friends say prove this or prove that, I live my whole life based on things that I can't prove.
[time=1481] I can show you, I love my wife, and she can show you, she loves me.
[time=1485] My whole life is set in motion, but I can't prove it.
[time=1489] I've been in DC many, many times.
[time=1492] I've seen lots of memorials in Washington, DC, and so have many of you.
[time=1496] A memorial to what happened at Iwo Jima, Marine Corps.
[time=1501] Unbelievable valor encouraged in the worst possible circumstances.
[time=1506] They demonstrate valor and courage and bravery.
[time=1511] But how do you prove it? You demonstrate it. You don't prove it.
[time=1516] If you are the Christ, prove it.
[time=1520] This whole thing is a sham. This whole trial is a sham.
[time=1524] But as my wife said last night, his trial, this would be good for you to write down in your notes.
[time=1531] Jesus' trial is my trial.
[time=1536] He goes in my place. I'm the one guilty.
[time=1541] He did it in my place, although he did nothing wrong.
[time=1547] There's all these very specific rules about how things are supposed to go.
[time=1551] In this setting, the judges were the defense attorneys.
[time=1556] The witnesses that come against the accused person, they're the prosecution.
[time=1560] So the judges, of course, serving are the priests.
[time=1563] They're the ones in charge, making sure the accused person's rights aren't being violated.
[time=1569] They actually take the position as the judge in this trial as the prosecutor.
[time=1575] Can you imagine? That would make for quite a law and order episode.
[time=1580] If the judge becomes the prosecutor, it's outrageous.
[time=1584] And Deuteronomy says you have to have two or three witnesses before any charges can be brought.
[time=1588] And Luke mentions nothing about any witnesses at all.
[time=1592] Other gospels do you, but Luke mentions none of them.
[time=1595] Maybe because their testimony wasn't consistent, they couldn't agree on anything.
[time=1600] They had no witnesses, and you couldn't say things in your own trial against yourself that was inadmissible.
[time=1608] It's not like the Fifth Amendment that you can plead the Fifth and not say anything.
[time=1612] If you say something that makes yourself look more guilty, you cannot use that in trial at this point.
[time=1617] That's exactly what they lead him away for. It's outrageous.
[time=1623] If you are the Christ, tell us, I want you to, we're breaking our own rules by making you tell us what the accusation is.
[time=1631] And he is, of course, friends, the Messiah. He is the Christ.
[time=1635] And so he has led away to Pilate and eventually murdered because he is so he says he is.
[time=1641] It's a staggering statement. He goes into all this. He enters into it.
[time=1646] For us, if I tell you you won't believe.
[time=1650] If I ask you, you will not answer verse 69, but from now on, the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God.
[time=1659] Luke is intensely interested in this whole story on telling us who Jesus is, putting that on display.
[time=1666] Look at Daniel 7. I don't know if it will be on the screens behind me or not, but Daniel 7.
[time=1673] He loves to call himself Son of Man, and this is the reason why Jesus likes to call himself Son of Man.
[time=1680] Maybe if I was wondered that. Here's one reason why.
[time=1683] Daniel 7, 13, and 14. I saw in the night visions and behold with the clouds of heaven, there came one like a Son of Man.
[time=1693] And he came to the ancient of days and was presented before him.
[time=1697] And to him, the Son of Man was given dominion and glory and a kingdom that all peoples, nations and languages should serve him.
[time=1706] His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom won, but shall not be destroyed.
[time=1715] Listen to how they respond in verse 70 to that statement.
[time=1720] Son of Man, right hand of the power. Okay, they know exactly what he's saying.
[time=1724] Verse 70. So they all said, "Are you the Son of God then?" Because they know Daniel 7, what it says, they know it very well. It's their responsibility before the people.
[time=1735] So you're saying, "You're God then. You have divine power." Is that what you're saying?
[time=1740] Verse 70. He said to them, "You say that I am."
[time=1747] Basically, Jesus is saying, "I won't deny it, but I mean it differently than you mean it."
[time=1754] You're using it as an accusation. That's just who I am.
[time=1758] He is led away to be murdered because he is who he says he is.
[time=1765] What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.
[time=1772] "I just mentioned to you." That's the one thing you can't do.
[time=1779] And the judges are the prosecutors. There are no defense attorneys in Jewish law.
[time=1786] Those who sit in seats of power are supposed to make sure everything goes fairly.
[time=1790] And they've left their judges seat and gone down to serve as prosecutors.
[time=1795] This is outrageous. It's in the middle of the night, early morning.
[time=1807] It's very disturbing. Hebrews 4. I think that will be on the screens behind me. Hebrews 4.
[time=1817] Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens Jesus, the Son of God.
[time=1825] Let us hold fast our confession. We don't have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses,
[time=1832] but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are yet without sin.
[time=1839] Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace.
[time=1844] There is no one else in power, in religion or in history who has a throne of grace.
[time=1854] There are lots of thrones of power coming bow down before me and kissed my ring and do what I say.
[time=1863] Jesus has a throne of grace. Aren't you glad for that this morning?
[time=1871] That we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
[time=1877] None of your suffering is meaningless and he understands it all.
[time=1882] He can sympathize with your weaknesses. He suffered. You will suffer.
[time=1888] Because he suffered, you can face your suffering.
[time=1892] Your suffering is meaningful. It's not meaningless.
[time=1898] When you frame it in the light of what Christ has done.
[time=1904] The second point in your outline is that Jesus is our priest.
[time=1909] He is our great high priest who intercedes for us.
[time=1915] He intercedes. That means he goes in there for us. He does what you couldn't do.
[time=1921] You know that once a year the high priest in ancient Israel would go into the place on behalf of the people and offer sacrifices to God. That's exactly what Jesus says. He's the great high priest.
[time=1932] He intercedes for us. He's our prophet. He knows everything about you.
[time=1936] He's your priest. He goes in for you. He will end there for this ridiculous trial.
[time=1941] He did with his eyes wide open. Did it for you? He did it for me because I couldn't do it myself.
[time=1950] Marvelous. It's marvelous. We're in 23 now, Luke 23 verse 1.
[time=1955] The whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate.
[time=1959] They bring him to Pilate because they could not carry out a death sentence themselves.
[time=1964] Only the Romans could do that. They were not occupied people. The Romans were in charge.
[time=1969] The Jewish stories couldn't bring an execution to bear. They had to get the Romans to do that for them.
[time=1977] They brought him to the pot. They began to accuse him, verse 2, saying, "We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar." Maybe yours says, "Pay taxes." That's what it means.
[time=1990] They said that Jesus forbade them from paying taxes to Caesar.
[time=1995] Saying that he himself is Messiah, Christ, a king.
[time=2001] To give tribute again is to pay taxes in Luke chapter 20. Just three chapters ago,
[time=2007] he says to a crowd of people. Let's look at that passage.
[time=2011] Look at Luke 20 starting in verse 19. This is extraordinary.
[time=2017] You know this passage, probably. This story.
[time=2022] Luke 20 starting in verse 19 describes in chief priests sought to lay hands on him, Jesus,
[time=2028] at that very hour, to lay hands on. They wanted to get ahold of him, to get rid of him, but not yet.
[time=2033] They perceived he told a parable, a story against them, but they feared the people.
[time=2037] They watched verse 20 him and sent spies who pretended to be sincere.
[time=2044] This is just really disturbing, but they might catch him in something. He said, "So I should deliver him to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor." So they asked him teacher. This is the man they went to kill, by the way, this person I'm about to describe.
[time=2058] Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly.
[time=2064] You've got to kill him. Show no partiality. He's got to go.
[time=2071] But truly teach the way of God. This is their greeting for no partiality.
[time=2079] Teach the way of God and truth. We've got to kill him.
[time=2082] This is so outrageous. Is it lawful, verse 22, Luke 20, to give tribute to Caesar or not?
[time=2091] But he perceived their craftiness and said to them, show me a denarius.
[time=2096] Show me a coin that was a day's way, denarius.
[time=2101] Whose likeness and inscription does it have? Caesars, they said.
[time=2107] He said to them, "Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are gods."
[time=2115] Did he forbid them from paying taxes? Friends, can we all answer together? Of course he didn't.
[time=2123] And they were not able, in the presence of the people, to catch him in what he said, but marveling at his answer, they became silent.
[time=2134] It's outrageous. I'm a liar.
[time=2140] I put myself before people as what I'm not, misrepresent myself. I'm probably only one in the room.
[time=2148] Those accusations made against me, you're a fraud. You're right.
[time=2154] And he goes in. He goes in on my behalf to do what I couldn't do.
[time=2159] I couldn't stand this scrutiny. He could.
[time=2163] Pilate asked, we're back in Luke 23, verse 3.
[time=2168] Pilate asked him, are you the king of the Jews? He answered him, you've said so.
[time=2174] Verse 4, "Then Pilate said, the chief priests and crowds, I find no guilt in this man."
[time=2181] This is the recurring theme, again, of the whole Luke accounts of this story, the innocence of Jesus.
[time=2189] This is the first, by the way, friends, of three times Pilate will say, I find no guilt in this man.
[time=2195] Three times, he says it. No guilt. No guilt. No guilt.
[time=2201] He was crucified for being who he is. They were urgent here. It says in verse 5,
[time=2209] saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea from Galilee, even to this place."
[time=2220] The language Luke uses here shows that they pressed their case with continual pleading.
[time=2227] Pilate needs to understand that law and order is at stake. And this guy's a rabble rouser.
[time=2235] Pilate does what many politicians do here. He passes the buck and lets someone else makes a tough call.
[time=2240] When Pilate discovers that Jesus is Galilee and he goes, Herod, that's where we're headed next.
[time=2247] All these forced are swirling around Pilate. Despite his innocence, the trial proceeds, sin has a way of ignoring Jesus' claims or deferring them, passing them on.
[time=2259] I'll just -- nothing that happens, by the way, changes Pilate's mind.
[time=2265] He willingly condemns an innocent man, which is why he will wash his hands later on.
[time=2272] It's really scary stuff. What the chief priests and crowds are saying is true.
[time=2278] They just don't like it.
[time=2281] In mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis said, "You must be asking which door is the true one, not which pleases you best."
[time=2289] You must be asking, "Which door is the true one, not which pleases you best?"
[time=2297] And is there any surprise, dear friends, that Jesus comes in John's gospel and says, "I'm the door of the sheep." John 10, 10, "The thief comes to steal, to kill and destroy. I came, they may have life and have it abundantly."
[time=2317] The third point in your outline is that Jesus is our King, who reigns over us in love.
[time=2332] As the band comes up on the stage, again, we're going to worship now in light of all that Christ has said and done.
[time=2341] We're going to worship God with song. We're going to worship God by giving him offerings.
[time=2346] Seems appropriate.
[time=2348] Revelation chapter 1 verse 4 says, "John, to the seven churches that are in Asia, grace to you in peace from him who is and who was and who is to come.
[time=2358] From the seven spirits who are before this throne and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead and the ruler of the kings on earth.
[time=2368] To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and made us a kingdom,
[time=2378] priests to his God and father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever, amen.
[time=2386] Behold, he is coming with the clouds and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all the tribes on the earth will wail on account of him, even so, amen.
[time=2400] I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God who is and who was and who was to come, the Almighty.
[time=2410] Jesus is our prophet who knows us fully. Jesus is our priest who intercedes for us.
[time=2419] And Jesus is our king who reigns over us in love.
[time=2424] One thing to read to you before we sing. I hope this hovers over us as we sing.
[time=2430] This is our hope and our comfort. Jesus Christ is the final prophet, the great high priest and the conquering king.
[time=2438] There is a miraculous cure for the disease of ignorance, guilt and sin pollution, after all.
[time=2446] John Calvin said in Christ God has fulfilled what he has promised.
[time=2450] The truth of his promises will be realized in the person of the Son.
[time=2455] Believers have found to be true. Paul is saying all the promises of God find their yes and amen in Christ.
[time=2465] He has come as our sovereign suffering servant to do for us what we couldn't do for ourselves.
[time=2473] Sing, friends, in light of that truth this morning.
[time=2480] Stand with us please as we sing about Jesus's throne of grace. His grace is enough.
[time=2501] Great is your faithfulness, O God. You wrestle with us in our time.
[time=2515] You lead us by still waters into mercy. And nothing can keep us apart.
[time=2529] So remember your people, remember your children, remember your promise of God.
[time=2544] Your grace is enough, your grace is enough, your grace is enough for me.
[time=2559] Great is your love and justice God.
[time=2566] You use the way to lead us strong.
[time=2573] You lead us in the song of your salvation.
[time=2580] And all your people sing along. So remember your people, remember your children, remember your promise of God.
[time=2601] Your grace is enough, your grace is enough, your grace is enough for me.
[time=2630] So remember your people, remember your children, remember your promise of God.
[time=2645] Your grace is enough, your grace is enough, your grace is enough for me.
[time=2673] Your grace is enough, your grace is enough for me.
[time=2687] Your grace is enough for me.
[time=2737] Holding on my knees in worship, giving all I am to seek your face.
[time=2749] Lord, all I am is yours.
[time=2757] My whole life I place in your hands, blood of mercy, humble, I bow down.
[time=2768] In your presence at your throne.
[time=2776] I call you and serve, and you came to my rescue and die.
[time=2788] I wanna be where you are.
[time=2806] My whole life I place in your hands, God of mercy, humble, I bow down.
[time=2817] In your presence at your throne.
[time=2825] I call you and serve, and you came to my rescue and die.
[time=2837] I wanna be where you are.
[time=2845] I call you and serve, and you came to my rescue and die.
[time=2857] I wanna be where you are.
[time=2885] In my life, in my life, be lifted high in my world.
[time=2893] Be lifted high in my love, be lifted high.
[time=2905] Be lifted high in my love, be lifted high in my love, be lifted high.
[time=2924] Sing it again in my life, be lifted high in my world.
[time=2934] Be lifted high in my love, be lifted high.
[time=2944] I call you and serve, and you came to my rescue and die.
[time=2957] I wanna be where you are.
[time=2969] Amen. You may be seated.
[time=2991] Come now, fount of every blessing, to my heart to sing thy grace.
[time=3000] Streams of mercy, never ceasing.
[time=3005] Call for sons of loudest praise.
[time=3010] Teach me some melodious summit.
[time=3015] Sun by flaming, sun's above.
[time=3020] Praise the mountain, fixed upon it.
[time=3025] Mount of my redeemer.
[time=3037] I was lost in utter darkness, till you came and rescued me.
[time=3046] I was found by all my sin when your love came and set me free.
[time=3055] Now my soul can sing a new song.
[time=3060] Now my heart has found a home.
[time=3065] And my grace is always with me.
[time=3070] And I'll never be alone.
[time=3077] Come now, fount, come now be.
[time=3082] Come now, precious Prince of Peace.
[time=3086] Hear your pride, do we see?
[time=3091] Come now, fount of every blessing.
[time=3096] Come now, fount, come now be.
[time=3100] Come now, precious Prince of Peace.
[time=3105] Hear your pride, do we see?
[time=3110] Come now, fount, come now to sing.
[time=3122] Oh, to grace, how great a debtor.
[time=3126] Daily, I'm constrained to be.
[time=3131] Let my goodness, like a feather, by my fond green heart you need.
[time=3140] 'Cause I'm prone to wonder, Lord, I feel it.
[time=3145] I'm prone to lead the God I love.
[time=3150] Here's my heart, oh, take and steal it.
[time=3155] Seal it for thy cards above.
[time=3162] Come now, fount, come now be.
[time=3166] Come now, precious Prince of Peace.
[time=3171] Hear your pride, do we see?
[time=3176] Come now, fount, come now sing.
[time=3185] Come now, precious Prince of Peace.
[time=3190] Hear your pride, do we see?
[time=3195] Come now, fount, come now be.
[time=3224] In the eyes to see more of who you are.
[time=3230] May what I behold, still my anxious heart.
[time=3237] Take what I know, you break it all apart.
[time=3243] 'Cause you, my God, are greater still.
[time=3251] And the sky contains no doubt
[time=3257] for strains all you are.
[time=3260] The greatness of our God spent my life to know that I live far from close to what you are.
[time=3274] The greatness of our God.
[time=3281] [MUSIC]
[time=3385] There's nothing that could ever separate us There is nothing that could ever separate us
[time=3394] There is nothing that could ever separate us from your love.
[time=3401] No light, no doubt of desire convinced that you, my God, are greater still.
[time=3414] There is nothing that could ever separate us
[time=3420] There is nothing that could ever separate us from your love.
[time=3427] No light, no doubt of desire convinced that you, my God, are greater still.
[time=3440] And no word could say or song convey all you are.
[time=3450] The greatness of our God spent my life to know that I live far from close to what you are.
[time=3506] The greatness of our God
[time=3510] [MUSIC]
[time=3518] I was lost in utter darkness You came and rescued me I was bound by all my sin When your love came and set me free
[time=3539] Now my soul can sing a new song
[time=3545] Now my heart has found a home
[time=3551] Now your grace is always with me
[time=3557] And I'll never be alone
