[time=0] You
[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=60] Well, good morning, everybody. Welcome to the Bible. Our my name is Steve Webster. I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries. I'm so glad that you're watching. I'm so glad that I get to tell you a week by week that we're glad that you're part of our family. We see you that way. We have for many, many years and we're glad that you're watching. We're glad that you have allowed us to be encouragement to you in that way. If you're watching in the morning, we want to make sure that you realize that you
[time=90] can still come be a part of what's going on here on site on Sunday morning. We meet at nine o'clock in our community groups at Sunday school hour, if you will, and then the 10 30 hour is our gathering in the sanctuary. It's our worship hour. So we
[time=104] would love for you to come be a part of that. You still got time. We'll start till 10 30 in the sanctuary. So if you have enjoyed watching on the broadcast, we've asked
[time=115] you for years to come and be a part of what's going on in the room. So don't miss the opportunity if you can. If you want to go back and watch or listen to
[time=124] anything that we've done in Sunday morning, the music or the messages as a way for you to do that on our website, we would hate for you to miss that opportunity. There's going back months and months we've archived all kinds of information there for you. So if you wanted to go back and maybe listen to that again or maybe get that quote that you may have missed or hear that song that you really enjoyed again, that's a way for you to do it at blackhockmenistries.org backslash messages. I want to take a minute this morning to introduce to you a friend of mine, Doody Baker, who is in charge of our student ministries here at Black Hawk. He's going to come tell you about what's available for your kids, for your students at both the middle school and the high school levels. Hi, I'm Doody
[time=165] Baker and I oversee six through 12th grades at Black Hawk Ministries and I lead an incredible team that loves students. We want your students to be plugged in, student ministries here at Black Hawk. We have a Sunday morning at nine o'clock. We have for all students a place where they can really learn God's Word that's really geared for that age group and we also have Wednesday nights for high school kids, a place where they can experience God with other high school students. They worship God and they have small settings where they can they can discuss and learn things together. We also have middle school small youth groups on Wednesday nights that meets. It's just been an incredible just learning process for these middle school kids and that's that's new for this year and we're really excited about that. We want your students to be involved here so please if there if your student at home is not involved with the student ministry please email me at debaker at blackhawkministries.org or give me a
[time=223] call at 493 7400 extension 274 and I would love to meet your student and we
[time=229] would love to have them a part of our ministry. Make sure to take advantage of those opportunities. Duty's a great guy and would love to come alongside you and to serve your family and to love your kids. If you've been watching for a long time and are wondering where all this works we wanted to give you an opportunity to be involved in the Founders Club. The Bible Hour has been a part of your lives and a part of this community for many many years and putting this on television requires money and we want to give you the opportunity to be a blessing to this ministry and to regularly contribute to putting it on
[time=265] the air. We believe that this has been a great blessing to our community over the years and we love to do it, love to be a part of it, but we can't do it without support. So Founders Club is a way for you to do that in a regular and a systematic way that I think is honoring to God and we've tried to honor that and for the very many years that we've been before you in this way. So call that number and communicate with us about how you can be a blessing to us in that way as we've tried to be a blessing to you and to our community over the years.
[time=292] Thank you so much for watching. Thanks again for being part of our family. Have a great week and God bless.
[time=310] I will feast at the table of the Lord. I will feast at the table of the Lord. I
[time=327] won't hunger anymore at his table. I will feast at the table of the Lord. I will
[time=345] feast at the table of the Lord. I won't hunger anymore at his table. Come on
[time=362] he will rise. Come and find his joke is easy, his bird and life. He is a boy, he
[time=376] will restore at the table of the Lord. There is peace at the table of the Lord.
[time=391] There is peace at the table of the Lord. I won't worry anymore at his table.
[time=406] There is healing at the table of the Lord. There is healing at the table of the Lord.
[time=420] I won't suffer anymore at his table. Come on he will rise. Come and find his joke is easy, his
[time=442] bird and life. He is a boy, he will restore at the table of the Lord.
[time=458] If I know he has a place for me for what joy will fill my heart with the
[time=471] saints around the mercy seat of God. Come on he will rise. Come and find his joke is easy, his
[time=491] bird and life. He is a boy, he will restore at the table of the Lord.
[time=506] I'm invited to the table of the Lord. I'm invited to the table of the Lord. He says,
[time=533] come just as you are to his table.
[time=557] I was so focused on what we were doing there that I really want us to. I want us to transition
[time=569] for just a minute. It's an important transition, significant.
[time=579] When we come to the table, it's no accident that we're supposed to be reminded and to
[time=586] remember. If you're the first time that you've ever been with us today, we're really glad
[time=593] that you've joined us. We really are. If you're joining us today for the first time on the
[time=599] Bible hour or through other media, online stuff, we pray that your time with us draws
[time=605] us to a spot together of closer to Christ and closer to what it means to follow him.
[time=614] So thanks for being with us. Our four-day series theme has been Jesus came and it's
[time=622] the top of your bulletin. Jesus came as the sovereign, sovereign, suffering, servant
[time=633] to do for us what we could not do for ourselves. To do for you what you could not do for yourself.
[time=644] Arlen and I talked recently about a concept of the morning greeting that you get when
[time=650] you wake up and sometimes you get that morning greeting that's even before you've opened
[time=658] your eyes and there's a thought that God puts on your mind. What do you do with that?
[time=665] This morning, I'm just going to tell you something that's really sweet that happened.
[time=670] Even so sweet that I woke up with Matthew 11 on my mind this morning, not remembering
[time=681] that we were singing the table song that we just sang. Matthew 11, 28 says, "Come to
[time=690] me all you who are weary and burdened." I believe that there's a bunch of you here
[time=696] today that way. And I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for
[time=706] I am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls. My yoke is easy
[time=715] and my burden is light. We just took a sweet time to remember, to remember his death burial
[time=728] resurrection intentionally because we believe it's significant. I'm going to ask you to
[time=736] do something right now just right where you are because I believe the Holy Spirit does it not only when you wake up but he does it right now. I want you to just take a minute.
[time=746] It won't even be a minute, a moment. I want you to whisper these words to God. What do
[time=753] you want me to take away from what we just done? What we just did? Do well on it and
[time=761] remember it. We're just saying, I will feast at the table of the Lord. I won't hunger
[time=768] anymore. We're just saying there is peace at the table of the Lord. I won't worry anymore.
[time=793] Right where you're at. Right where you're at. I want you to just close your eyes and ask
[time=801] God that question. What do you want me to take away from what we just observed and speak
[time=809] to me through the Word of God? Heavenly Father, we believe deeply in the power
[time=833] of your Holy Spirit to make life look different. Not because of the things that we do but because
[time=841] of what you've already done. The gospel is good news of what's done and not what we can
[time=847] do. I pray that this morning already, the things we've sung, the things we've remembered
[time=855] from your sacrifice. The things that we teach right now, that you would plant those seeds
[time=863] deeply in the minds of those who are sitting and listening, those who are within the sound of my voice, God, that you would plant a seed that bears fruit for your kingdom and their
[time=875] life. Have it be that today? May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
[time=887] be pleasing to you. God, may your word be brought rightly divided today. In Jesus'
[time=896] name, amen. I really do believe that. I do believe that there are some of you that have
[time=904] come this week. Haven't had really rough weeks, that it really feels like suffering. There
[time=918] are marriages. There are marriages on the brink. There are. There are students making
[time=929] choices every day, whether you're at St. Francis or Woodlun or Blackout Christian or wherever you're at, you're making choices every day. And so we come here to make sure that we take
[time=943] the time to exalt the name of Jesus Christ and to realize that the name of Jesus every
[time=951] knee will bow and tongue confess. And so we spend a four-day series, four days in the
[time=961] life of Christ, talking about what he's done, what he's done, not what you can do, what
[time=969] he's done. And today we're going to talk about some things that he's done, things that he's
[time=976] done, more along the suffering mode, more along the suffering servant mode. But I would
[time=984] submit to you today that some of these things are going to connect really well, because
[time=993] we are a lot like some of the people we're going to read about today. We are. Today we're
[time=1000] going to talk about the fact that Jesus went before two guys, Pilate and Herod, and there
[time=1007] was a bunch of, just a bunch of garbage that happened. We're going to talk about how he was accused wrongly, how he was found not guilty, and yet still punished. It's real.
[time=1025] Flip with me, if you will, to Luke chapter 23 verses 6 through 16 is what a passage for
[time=1031] today. We're going to read that. Luke chapter 23 verses 6 through 16. "On hearing this,
[time=1044] Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean. When he learned that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction,
[time=1051] he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. When Herod saw Jesus, he was
[time=1058] greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform a sign of some sort. He applied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer. The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there vehemently accusing him. Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate. That day,
[time=1086] Herod and Pilate became friends before this day had been enemies. Pilate together called
[time=1092] the chief priests, the rulers and the people, and said to them, "You brought me this man
[time=1098] as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him." Neither has Herod, nor for he has sent him
[time=1111] back to us. As you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death, therefore I will punish him
[time=1117] and then release him. What's interesting is when you look at this, Herod and Pilate were
[time=1129] not the good guys in this story. When you look back at verse 4, right back from where
[time=1135] Webby was last week, it goes back in verse 4 and it talks about him. Already been declared
[time=1143] by Pilate. It's not guilty. I find no basis for a charge of him. Verse 5, it says, "Pilate
[time=1150] said that he started in Galilee and he's come all the way here." Then we get to verse 6 and it says, "On hearing this, on hearing the fact that he's come that far, and he heard
[time=1161] the key phrase Galilee." He heard the phrase Galilee and Pilate says, "Hold, wait a second.
[time=1171] Maybe I can get from out from underneath of this Jesus thing. There's an avenue that
[time=1177] this guy's from Galilee, he belongs under Herod's territory." That's what it says in
[time=1186] verse 7, when you learn that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod who was also in Jerusalem at that time. To be clear, Herod is the son. This Herod, Herod
[time=1197] Antipas is the son of Herod the Great. He'd been given a region in the Galilee north
[time=1203] south. He'd be given that region to rule as one of the sons of Herod. He was not a
[time=1211] nice guy. Herod was not a nice guy. John the Baptist? John the Baptist lost his head at
[time=1222] the command of Herod. Flip with me back over to Mark chapter 6. Mark chapter 6, it won't
[time=1231] be up on the screen, but Mark chapter 6 makes it pretty clear where Herod was at. Mark
[time=1240] chapter 6, verse 20. Actually, we'll look at verse 19. So Herodias nursed a grudged
[time=1254] against John and wanted to kill him. That Herodias is the wife that Herod had married
[time=1263] of his brother and just a horrible, horrible, ugly thing. And John had said in verse 18,
[time=1271] "Is it not lawful for you to have your brother's wife?" He's confronted it blatantly. But
[time=1279] he was not able to kill him because Herod feared John and protected him. Knowing him
[time=1290] to be a righteous and holy man, there was a stage in Herod's life where Herod could
[time=1296] recognize a righteous and holy man in the person of John. When he heard John, he was
[time=1302] greatly puzzled, but look at what he had. It says, "Yet he liked to listen to him."
[time=1311] There was a season in Herod's life that his heart was at least somewhat tender to the things
[time=1317] of John saying. Even him being confronted for the garbage of sleeping with his brother's
[time=1323] wife and divorcing his to do that, and Herod says that he was listening. He liked to listen
[time=1333] to John. I submit to you today that all of a sudden we get to Herod, and Herod looks
[time=1342] a whole lot different at this trial and in Jerusalem when it comes time to sit and talk
[time=1351] to Jesus. Herod says, right in verse 7, "He had been in Jerusalem. When Herod saw Jesus,
[time=1363] he was greatly pleased because for a long time he had been wanting to see him from what
[time=1370] he had heard of him, he hoped to see him perform a sign of some sort."
[time=1377] Your first fill in the blank is, "Jesus isn't an act to be observed." Jesus isn't an act
[time=1387] to be observed. It's not like he's going downtown to the spot and you watch the civic
[time=1393] theater and you go watch somebody play out the act of Jesus. Some act that he could observe
[time=1400] that we could applaud and say, "Oh, that one was good." And that's what Herod was wanting
[time=1408] from Christ. He was wanting from Christ some sign, some sign. Let me ask you this.
[time=1424] What part of you is like Herod that comes to Jesus expecting him to act in the way that
[time=1436] you want him to? You come to the table with an expectation that says, "Do this in my
[time=1446] marriage. Do this with my son. Do this with my job." That's not what we're meant to do.
[time=1457] We're meant to come to the table and receive. We're come to the table and receive what
[time=1464] he's done. It is wrong for us to expect actions from Jesus on demand. He wanted to see him
[time=1471] in action. It's wrong for us to expect the actions on demand. It's just as much of an
[time=1481] issue 2,000 years ago as it is today. Some of you come to hear to get Jesus to do what
[time=1490] you want. Some of you might be like Pilate. Pilate was coming to a spot that was being
[time=1500] directly brought to Christ in front of him. And Pilate wanted to do everything that he
[time=1507] could do to avoid being with Jesus that way. He wanted to send Jesus to Herod. He wanted
[time=1517] to get away from the result of that conviction. The chief priests in the crowd, the chief priests
[time=1529] in the crowd were going to hear more about. But they had an agenda with Jesus too. What
[time=1538] does it look like? Jesus isn't an act to be observed. We shouldn't want to see Jesus in action in a way that conforms to our standard. And be careful what you expect according
[time=1552] to your desires and your wants. My wants are not what we're looking for. When it comes
[time=1561] to the difficult things that Jesus brings to bear in your life, are you responding like Pilate and want to send him away in avoidance or Herod wanting him to do what you want or
[time=1572] are you embracing the loving servant who wants to bring about change in your life on his terms
[time=1581] and his time, not yours. One of the things that we talked about in the teaching meeting
[time=1593] this week actually is this wrestle that we have, that we wrestle with this concept of
[time=1599] this to-do list and that you come to church on a Sunday morning expecting me to give you a to-do list that makes the week all go perfectly. And that if you do your to-do list, just exactly
[time=1611] right, that everything is going to go sweet and everything is going to be fine, fine, fine. It couldn't be farther from the truth. Because again, it's not about what you can
[time=1623] do when you come in here for yourself. Remember, sovereign, suffering, servant to do for you
[time=1633] what you can't do for yourself. What are you trying to do that you can't do? Stop thinking
[time=1644] that there's a top ten to-do list that when you do it, everything will be better. That's not true. Ours needs to be a response because of what's already done, not so he can do something
[time=1655] for us that we think we need. We've already said he's not an act to be observed. Let's
[time=1661] look at verses 9 through 12 where we see Jesus as de-accused. I will tell you this, that
[time=1670] for you there are spots where you can't stop and think of anything else but how hard it
[time=1677] is for somebody to accuse you of something that you're not guilty of. It happens regularly
[time=1687] in our home with the three raver boys. It does. They're brothers. They do love each other
[time=1693] but they are brothers. And we get to the spot where all of a sudden somebody's making
[time=1699] a big huge case about it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it that way. And it's all about
[time=1707] the accusation. Jesus as de-accused is a spot that we really need to understand. See, Herod
[time=1721] actually, he sounds right there in verse 9, he plied him with many questions. But what
[time=1728] did Jesus do? He didn't give him an answer. It's interesting that Herod is the one that
[time=1736] Jesus didn't reply to. Herod didn't get a response. Pilot did. Pilot did get a response.
[time=1748] Pilot got a response in ways that like it is as you say, it's, it's, it's, it's, are
[time=1755] you the king of the Jews? He responded to some of those things. Herod got nothing. And
[time=1762] it's a pretty common thought that the reason that he got nothing was because Jesus saw his heart. Jesus knew that he had went, he had transitioned from a spot where there
[time=1773] was a soft tender heart willing to look at John and listen to John and protect John from
[time=1779] his life, Herodias, to a certain point. Many believe that it's just because he knew that
[time=1789] Jesus, Jesus knew that Herod was going to do what he was going to do, that he was going
[time=1796] to, he was going to accuse him, ridicule him, mock him. He was giving him no more of
[time=1805] the truth because he knew he wasn't going to listen. What does it mean for us to be at
[time=1812] this spot? To respond to the gospel of Jesus Christ when our hearts tender and convictions
[time=1820] present. See, Herod was at a spot where he listened. He was listening to John, but he
[time=1829] didn't respond. He was listening to him and then walked away from it. Now you come to
[time=1840] the spot where John is gone, his heads been dealt with, and you have Jesus seeing the
[time=1848] thoughts and intentions of Herod's heart. And Jesus gives him no more truth. He's silent.
[time=1862] Herod's heart, heart, and thoughts of God were exposed by his open ridicule and mocking of his soldiers. The next fill in the blank is, and I tell my sons this all the time. If
[time=1873] you're not guilty, be cautious of the need to defend. If you're not guilty, don't act
[time=1881] like you are. Jesus, in 1 Peter, 2, 21 through 24, he says this, "But how is it to your credit
[time=1894] if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. To this you were called because Christ
[time=1905] suffered for you, leaving an example that you should follow in his steps. He committed
[time=1912] no sin and no deceit was found in his mouth. When they hurled their insults at him, he
[time=1923] did not retaliate. When he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself
[time=1936] to the one who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross so that
[time=1942] we might die to sins and live for righteousness. By his wounds, we have been healed." Do you
[time=1953] understand what was happening? Those that were knowing, had knowledge of who he was,
[time=1962] and what was going on are the ones that you absolutely should have gotten it. And yet,
[time=1970] the word that he used is to describe their interaction with him. I looked at a bunch
[time=1978] of different places where this definition exists, vehemently accusing him. One place
[time=1991] said it's about that bearing, that gnashing of teeth. It's that component of saying they
[time=1998] were angry, very, very, very angry, vehemently accusing him, then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed
[time=2012] and mocked him. Some of you have been in situations recently where you've been accused, where you
[time=2025] have been unjustly accused, and you feel like you need to respond in a way that doesn't
[time=2036] honor Christ. Be careful of being at a spot where you need to defend yourself. That phrase
[time=2049] has been one that's been really real to me in the last couple years. What does it mean
[time=2056] to entrust? Entrust yourself, first Peter says that, entrust yourself to the one who judges
[time=2064] justly. Are you okay standing with a clear conscience before the king saying, "I'm good
[time=2077] with whatever you bring, Jesus." And entrust transaction is placing it out here like this,
[time=2087] entrust yourself to the one who judges justly. You want to talk about an example of what he's done. There's no more perfect example of him entrusting himself to the one who judges
[time=2099] justly. In the midst of ridicule, students, I'm telling you, at some point, I don't care
[time=2106] whether it's at St. Francis in a classroom of philosophy. I don't care where you're going to school at an IPFW or Woodland or Black Hawk Christian or wherever you're at in your workplace. There will be a spot when you take a stand for the name of Jesus Christ and you will be ridiculed. You will. Adults, that will happen to you. You make a bold claim for the
[time=2132] name of Jesus Christ and you will experience ridicule. You will experience mocking and
[time=2143] trust yourself to the one who judges justly. He knows the thoughts and intentions of your
[time=2149] heart. He does. Your next fill in the blank is, "Beware of the schemes of the enemy in
[time=2159] verses 10 and 11." The chief priests and the teachers of the law, they were standing there
[time=2169] vehemently accusing him, ridiculed and mocked him. They even dressed him up. They dressed
[time=2176] him up in kingly clothing to make him go back to Pilate looking like the king that he was
[time=2186] claiming to be, looking like the king. They were mocking everything that he said. Be aware
[time=2198] of the enemy. The enemy has an agenda and it's to displace the kingdom of God. For the
[time=2204] kingdom of God to come on this earth, the kingdom of the enemy has to be pushed away.
[time=2212] The enemy has a strategy. He has an agenda and it's not for the kingdom of the God and body of Christ and Christ to be glorified. He has that agenda. The enemy will aggressively
[time=2227] and vehemently advance that agenda. They will. There are those that are against you that
[time=2238] will mock you and set you up. Set you up to look like something that's degrading, that
[time=2247] distracts from the name of Christ. And ultimately even like Herod in Pilate, sometimes your
[time=2260] enemies will team up and become friends. Verse 12, that day Herod and Pilate became friends.
[time=2272] They became friends at the expense of Jesus. They became friends to the ridicule of Christ
[time=2288] before they had been enemies.
[time=2296] The third main section there is Jesus verdict before both Herod and Pilate was not guilty.
[time=2305] The verdict that they both came back with was we find no grounds for what you guys want to do with them. We find no grounds. Both Herod and Pilate come back not guilty.
[time=2322] What's interesting though is the phrase that is used by Pilate in verse 16. Neither is
[time=2333] Herod in verse 15. Neither is Herod for he sent him back to us. As you can see he has done nothing to deserve death. That's what they were asking for. You want to talk about unjust punishment. Therefore I will punish him. Good judge, he. I'm not sure how long
[time=2355] you'd land in office here and stay if everybody came up and the verdict was not guilty.
[time=2361] It's not guilty and he still says but I'm still going to punish him and release him just for good measure. I'm sure he's done something wrong. My grandpa used to say that. My grandpa
[time=2374] used to say that a lot. He used to say spank him even if it wasn't a reason for it that
[time=2380] day I'm sure there was another day that they needed it. He's accused of inciting the people
[time=2394] to rebellion back in verse 2. It was subverting the nation of Israel. It was opposing payment
[time=2401] of taxes and claiming to be Messiah and it still comes back not guilty. Your next fill
[time=2408] in the blank is this even though he was innocent even though we're innocent it doesn't mean
[time=2415] that we won't see difficulties. Even when you're innocent it does not mean that you
[time=2423] will not encounter the difficulties. The difficulties of the people of the circumstances of the
[time=2432] things to go on in a fallen world just because you're innocent does not mean you will not
[time=2438] experience a difficult life. One of the greatest lies propagating in our world today that goes
[time=2448] against the truth of Scripture is this. Are you listening? Here's the lie. If something
[time=2458] difficult is going on in your life either you screwed up or God did. That's a lie.
[time=2469] If there's something difficult in your life going on it does not mean that God screwed up or that you even sinned. Do you understand that? All too often we get to the spot where
[time=2482] we experience the hard things of life and the first thing that we go to is God. What in
[time=2488] the world did I do wrong? Jesus got put on a cross innocent. I find no charge against
[time=2505] this man. James chapter 1 verse 2 says, "Consider it my joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever
[time=2515] you face trials of many kinds because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.
[time=2522] Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature, maybe mature and complete not lacking anything." 1 Thessalonians 3 verses 2 through 4 says this. We sent Timothy who
[time=2537] is our brother and co-worker in God's service in spreading the gospel of Christ to strengthen
[time=2543] and encourage you in your faith so that no one of you would be unsettled by these trials.
[time=2553] Listen to this phrase. For you know quite well we were destined for them. In fact when
[time=2562] we were with you we kept telling you that we would be persecuted and it turned out that
[time=2568] way as you well know. Even though we're innocent it doesn't mean that you won't experience
[time=2579] difficulty in your life. Jesus went ahead of you and suffered the ultimate injustice
[time=2589] in doing that. Hebrews chapter 4 verses 15 and 16 is one of my favorite passages because
[time=2601] it speaks of this. It speaks of Jesus as our faithful high priest. It says, "For we do
[time=2607] not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses. But we have one who has
[time=2613] been tempted in every way just as we are." Real key. Yet he was without sin. He was
[time=2626] without sin. He was tempted just like you and I are. But he did not sin. It says therefore
[time=2639] let us get my versions mixed up. I haven't memorized in one version and I need to read another one. So I'll just read it and then I won't screw it up. Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help
[time=2655] in the time of need. See because we have times of need because we worry back to these lyrics
[time=2665] that we sang. We're hungry. We're hungry for things to be different.
[time=2677] We worry. We worry because we want things to be different. We wish that they look different
[time=2684] than that. But it says there's peace at the table of the Lord. There's healing at the
[time=2692] table of the Lord and we won't suffer anymore. It's that rough balance that says you don't
[time=2704] think that you're not going to suffer because you are. It's that tension. Don't come to Jesus expecting all cake and ice cream. All roses and bouquets. But the eternal perspective
[time=2720] is different because you bring it to the foot of the cross. Boldly approach your throne to find grace and mercy in time of need. You have need. You have it. Are you trying
[time=2733] to deal with it on your own? Or are you trying to bring it to the foot of the cross? Are you trying to bring it to the table? As the team comes up, I just want to remind you
[time=2748] that Jesus is exactly that. Sovereign, sovereign over everything. Do you realize that he could
[time=2758] have called 10,000 angels to blow up Herod and all his armies and pilots to? He didn't.
[time=2767] He was accused just like you and I. And there was a verdict. It was not guilty. Again,
[time=2784] I would ask you to think about what it means for you to boldly approach the throne of God
[time=2794] to find grace and mercy for your specific need. Your specific need because he knows it already.
[time=2802] What we just heard, this is good news. It really is good news that he suffered for us.
[time=2809] He's our priest. It's a great news. I want to sing that. I want to sing about good news
[time=2815] right now.
[time=2830] I woke up Monday morning and I walked out on the lawn. My eyes were barely open and my
[time=2839] mouth began to yawn. Vicked up the daily paper. Every single headline said that this whole world
[time=2848] is full of trouble. And I wish I'd stayed in bed. Sometimes the bad that's going on is
[time=2855] enough to bring you down. Turned through the television and began to flip on through. All
[time=2867] one hundred channel makes me owe in pay review. Not one message had a meaning that was good
[time=2875] in any way. Just before I wrote the whole world off, I heard the father say, "Don't forget
[time=2884] what I had promised. You can overcome it all."
[time=2891] I've spent this talk all over town about the peace of joy I've found in you, news, good news.
[time=2902] This story is about to break and bless it all. The feet could take the truth.
[time=2912] I'll slip it on my day to choose 'cause I've got good, good news.
[time=2924] Well, my knees began to shake up and my heart began to beat.
[time=2930] And a funny new sensation worked its way into my fear.
[time=2935] The spirit of flat tidings came from somewhere deep inside.
[time=2941] And holding back the blood was just like holding back the tide.
[time=2946] I couldn't help but circulate to everyone I know.
[time=2955] I've spent this talk all over town about the peace and joy I've found in you, news, good news.
[time=2966] This story is about to break and bless it all. The feet could take the truth, good news, good news.
[time=2976] I'm slipping on my day to choose 'cause I've got good, good news.
[time=2985] Good, good news.
[time=2988] I'll spread this talk all over town about the peace and joy I've found in you, news, good news.
[time=2995] Good, good news.
[time=2999] This story is about to break and bless it all. The feet could take the truth.
[time=3009] I'm slipping on my day to choose 'cause I've got good, good news.
[time=3044] Good, good news, good, good news.
[time=3074] I'm slipping on my day to choose 'cause I've got good news.
[time=3554] Hey, man. Hey, man.
[time=3584] I'm slipping on my day to choose 'cause I've got good news.
