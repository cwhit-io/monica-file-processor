[time=824] Well, good morning.
[time=841] Let's get after this this morning.
[time=843] If you have your Bibles turned to Luke 23 also, as you were coming in, you might have received a little handout like this.
[time=851] If you didn't receive one of those, there may be some ushers that have some extras.
[time=855] If you want to hold your hand up, they'll bring one to you.
[time=859] This is what's called a harmony of the Gospels.
[time=862] And we're going to read from this this morning.
[time=865] And so the staff made it possible for us to have a little handout that you can actually take with you.
[time=870] A harmony of the Gospel is simply, there's actually two types of harmonies.
[time=874] There's one harmony that's a traditional harmony that's a book that you open up.
[time=878] And as you go through it, it literally has all four Gospels on the same page.
[time=883] And it works through the whole Gospel.
[time=887] And it has all four Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John right there so you can see them on the same page.
[time=894] The other type of harmony is what we have here.
[time=897] This is what's called a blended harmony.
[time=899] It's actually from John MacArthur's work called One Perfect Life.
[time=904] And what it does is it takes all four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and it blends them together.
[time=911] So what is on this page is all Scripture.
[time=914] 100% Scripture, it's just the story blended together from all four Gospels.
[time=921] And so you get the complete picture from the four different perspectives
[time=927] of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[time=930] So we'll get to that in just a second.
[time=933] But hopefully all of you have that and you know what that is.
[time=936] Today, we'll continue looking at the last few days of Christ's life,
[time=943] noting again that the sovereign suffering servant came to do for us
[time=949] what we could never do for ourselves.
[time=951] And I understand you hear that.
[time=953] And again, the temptation is to check out.
[time=959] The temptation is to say, you know what?
[time=962] We've heard this for five, six weeks in a row now.
[time=965] I can't imagine there being anything more to glean from these passages.
[time=971] I mean, it's the same thing over and over, right?
[time=974] And while that is true, it is the same thing over and over.
[time=978] Understand this.
[time=979] Understand the magnitude of what is going on in this section of Scripture.
[time=984] This is the record of Christ etched into human history for the whole world to see,
[time=992] for the whole world to test, and for the entire world to choose to either believe it
[time=1002] or not believe it.
[time=1005] One of my pastors, Mike Bulmore, has said this about a passage.
[time=1010] He says it's important to understand what the passage says, but it's also having known what it says.
[time=1015] It's important to understand what the passage is doing.
[time=1019] In other words, this, why did God choose to orchestrate the words the way they are?
[time=1024] What was his purpose in slowing down here and capturing all these details
[time=1031] about the last four days of Jesus and his life?
[time=1036] Why did God choose to reveal these truths and not other truths?
[time=1040] Why has God slowed down and given us such detail?
[time=1045] What's the burden of this passage?
[time=1050] I believe God, through these last four days of Christ-like, is revealing or
[time=1056] hiding the case for Christ so that the world may know him and find in him
[time=1064] the way, the truth, and the life.
[time=1068] Specifically, the passage that we're going to look at this morning in Luke 23, starting in verse 13.
[time=1075] I believe the burden of this passage is to solidify in our hearts the historical reality of Jesus' sinlessness.
[time=1085] And therefore, his ability to be a substitute for anyone and everyone
[time=1095] who would choose to believe upon his name.
[time=1101] As we move through this passage, we're going to talk about three things.
[time=1104] We're going to see the setting.
[time=1106] We're going to look at the irony, and then we're going to end with the implications.
[time=1110] We're also, through our time, going to watch two different videos.
[time=1114] And so be prepared for that as well.
[time=1116] But let's take this out and we'll read the historical reality of Jesus Christ
[time=1122] from Matthew 27, Mark 15, Luke 23, and John 18, Jesus before Pilate.
[time=1130] Now at the feast, the governor was accustomed to releasing the multitude, one prisoner, whomever they requested.
[time=1137] You can see it's color-coded.
[time=1139] Maroon is Matthew, the blue is Mark, the yellow is from Luke's gospel, and the green is from John's gospel, blended together.
[time=1148] And at that time, they had a notorious prisoner, a robber named Barabbas, who was chained with his fellow rebels.
[time=1154] They had committed murder and a certain rebellion made in the city.
[time=1158] Therefore, when they had gathered together, the multitude crying aloud began to ask him to do just as he had always done for them, but Pilate answered them saying, "You have a custom that I should release someone to you at the Passover.
[time=1171] Whom do you want me to release to you?" Barabbas, or Jesus, who was called Christ, "Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" For he knew that the chief priest had handed him over because of envy.
[time=1187] While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that just man, for I have suffered many things today and a dream because of him." Then Pilate, when he had called together the chief priest, the rulers and the people, he said to them, "You have brought this man to me as one who misleads the people, and indeed having examined him in your presence." I have found no fault in this man concerning those things of what you accuse him.
[time=1218] No, neither did Herod, for I sent you back to him, and indeed nothing deserving of death has been done by him.
[time=1225] I will therefore chastise him and release him, for it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast.
[time=1234] But the chief priest and the elders stirred up the crowd so that they should ask for Barabbas
[time=1240] and destroy Jesus.
[time=1242] The governor answered and said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" And they all cried out at once, saying, "Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas,
[time=1253] not this man, but Barabbas." Pilate, therefore wishing to release Jesus answered and called out to them again,
[time=1262] "What then do you want me to do with Jesus who is called Christ, whom you call the king of the Jews?" But they all shouted and cried out again, saying to him, "Let him be crucified.
[time=1274] Crucify him.
[time=1276] Crucify him." And he said to them the third time, "Why?
[time=1284] What evil has he done?
[time=1287] I have found no reason for death in him.
[time=1290] I will therefore chastise him and let him go."
[time=1296] So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him, and the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe.
[time=1305] And they said, "Hail king of the Jews," and they struck him with their hands.
[time=1309] Pilate then went out again and said to them, "Behold, I'm bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no fault in him."
[time=1319] Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe.
[time=1323] Pilate said to them, "Behold the man." Therefore when the chief priests and officers saw him, they were insistent and cried out all the more, demanding with loud voices, saying, "Crucify him.
[time=1339] Crucify him." Pilate said to them, "You take him and crucify him, for I find no fault in him."
[time=1348] The Jews answered him.
[time=1349] He said, "We have a law, and according to our law, he ought to die because he made himself the son of God." Therefore when Pilate heard that saying, he was more afraid, and he went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.
[time=1367] Then Pilate said to him, "Are you not speaking to me?
[time=1371] Do you not know that I have power to crucify you and power to release you?" Jesus answered, "You could have no power at all against me,
[time=1382] unless it had been given you from above.
[time=1385] Therefore the one who delivered me to you has the greater sin." From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, "If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend.
[time=1397] Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar." When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
[time=1411] Now it was the preparation day of the Passover and about the sixth hour, and he said to the Jews, "Behold your king," but they cried out, away with him, away with him, crucify him.
[time=1427] It's overwhelming, isn't it?
[time=1432] But Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your king?"
[time=1438] The chief priest answered, "We have no king but Caesar." And the voices of these men and of the chief priest prevailed.
[time=1447] When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but rather that a tumult was rising, he took water and he washed his hands before the multitude, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this just person you see to it."
[time=1461] And all the people answered and said, "His blood be on us."
[time=1471] And on our children, so Pilate wanting to gratify the crowd,
[time=1477] he gave sentence that it should be as they requested.
[time=1484] Sorry.
[time=1491] And he released to them, "Barabbas," the one they requested, "who for rebellion and murder had been thrown into prison." God, thank you for your truth.
[time=1503] God, would you help us to glean from this again what you would want?
[time=1509] Would your spirit speak to us and lead us?
[time=1512] Would you help me this morning to be clear?
[time=1516] Jesus, you are the sinless, perfect, spotless Lamb of God.
[time=1528] We worship you this morning, Christ's name we pray, amen.
[time=1534] Well, let's look quickly at the setting.
[time=1537] It comes in verses 13 and 17.
[time=1541] We see in verse 13 just quickly the participants.
[time=1545] Who was there?
[time=1546] You've got Pilate with the Roman guards.
[time=1548] They had just gotten through investigating who Jesus is and what he was doing.
[time=1553] This would have been done in due diligence.
[time=1556] They would have done their homework.
[time=1558] They would have talked to different people.
[time=1560] The previous events of them interviewing Jesus and looking into this case would have been normal protocol.
[time=1570] You also have there the chief priests, the elders, the rulers of Jerusalem, probably the Sanhedrin,
[time=1576] which was a group of 70 rulers of Judaism.
[time=1581] They were the spiritual elite that made the decisions there for Jerusalem for the Jews.
[time=1589] Pilate knew of their envy.
[time=1591] Mark tells us that they were envious of Jesus.
[time=1594] They were there.
[time=1595] They were stirring up the crowd.
[time=1597] They were insistent.
[time=1598] There was the crowd of people that had gathered because remember this was the Passover feast.
[time=1604] And so people from even outside of Jerusalem had journeyed there for days to be there.
[time=1611] This was a large group of people.
[time=1615] There was Jesus and there was Barabbas.
[time=1619] And then look at verse 17.
[time=1621] There was in Luke 23, there was this tradition at the Passover feast.
[time=1629] As it says there, that it was necessary for him, Pilate, to release one of them at the feast.
[time=1636] In keeping with the theme of the Passover, we had already talked about the Passover lamb that would have been slain
[time=1643] and the blood would have been split or spilt on the mercy suite seat.
[time=1647] But there was also defined there at the Passover what's called a scapegoat.
[time=1653] It was a second lamb that the high priest would have put his hands upon the head in a illustration of the sins of the people
[time=1663] going upon the lamb of that goat.
[time=1665] And then that goat would be led outside of the city into the wilderness away.
[time=1671] It was the scapegoat.
[time=1672] It was the one that got away.
[time=1674] It was in essence just illustrating this beautiful grace of God that his sins would not be counted against.
[time=1684] So all of this comes together at this tradition that Pilate would have been able to release a guilty prisoner.
[time=1694] The crowd is there.
[time=1695] The chief priests full of envy are there.
[time=1698] And there's this amazing scene going on in Jerusalem sometime around AD 33.
[time=1706] Sets the stage for the irony of all ironies.
[time=1712] Comes to us in two parts.
[time=1713] We'll look at the findings and the verdicts.
[time=1715] First of all, the findings.
[time=1718] First Jesus, then Barabbas.
[time=1722] You couldn't have helped but notice the emphasis over and over and over again as I read the harmony that Pilate found no guilt in this man.
[time=1732] He was found by Pilate not to be guilty.
[time=1737] The overwhelming emphasis of Jesus' innocence is clearly seen in the context of this trial.
[time=1745] We can go back to verse 4 of Luke 23 where it says this.
[time=1750] So Pilate said to the chief priests in the crowd, "I find no fault in this man."
[time=1756] In verse 14 in our section, it says it this way.
[time=1760] He said to them, "You have brought this man to me as one who misleads the people.
[time=1764] And indeed, having examined him in your presence, I find no fault in this man concerning the things of which you accuse him."
[time=1773] Verse 15, "Neither did Herod, for I sent you back to him, and indeed nothing deserving of death has been done by him."
[time=1783] We go to verse 22.
[time=1786] Then he, Pilate said to them, "A third time.
[time=1791] Why? What evil has he done?
[time=1794] I have found no reason for death in him." We could go to the example in Matthew, the harmony in Mark, the harmony in John, and all of them are consistent.
[time=1805] John says it three times, Mark says it once, and Matthew says it once.
[time=1809] There was no guilt found in this man.
[time=1815] He was found to be blameless and innocent.
[time=1820] We back up even a little bit further from the context of this trial and look at Jesus' own testimony about himself.
[time=1828] In John chapter 8, he says this, "The Father has not left me alone, for I always do the things that please him."
[time=1837] In John 15, 10, he said, "If you keep my commandments, you'll abide in my love just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love."
[time=1847] Even Jesus' own personal testimony is that he had kept the Father's commandments, all of them.
[time=1855] We look at the New Testament report in Acts chapter 13.
[time=1859] It says this, "As Paul was preaching, he said this, "They found no cause for death in him.
[time=1865] They asked Pilate that he should be put to death." Hebrews chapter 4 says it this way, "For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are yet without sin."
[time=1885] First Peter chapter 2, we're just going on here about this innocence of Jesus. Chapter 2 verse 21, he says this, "For to this you were called because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example that you should follow in his steps."
[time=1899] He was the one who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth.
[time=1906] When he was reviled, he did not revile in return. When he suffered, he did not threaten, but he committed himself to him who judges righteously.
[time=1919] Paul in 2 Corinthians said this, "For God made him Jesus who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in him."
[time=1932] And then we can go back to Old Testament prophecies. We'll look at 1 Isaiah chapter 53 verse 9, it says this, "Because he had done no violence, nor was any deceit found in his mouth."
[time=1944] Listen, both Pilate and Herod found Jesus not guilty. The Old Testament prophesied about Jesus' innocence before he was even on the stage.
[time=1953] The writers of the New Testament affirm it. Jesus himself speaks about it to himself. We must conclude the Bible uniformly witnesses to the sinlessness of Jesus.
[time=1974] He was innocent of these charges, and every charge that could be brought against him. He of all people is not supposed to be here.
[time=1984] Everything about it, as I read it, just seems so wrong. He's done nothing but good. He's spoken nothing but truth.
[time=1997] But here he is. Here he stands. And then you have this other gentleman, Barabbas, guilty as charged verses 18 and 19 in Luke chapter 23 says this about him.
[time=2014] They all cried out at once, saying away with this man and released to us Barabbas, he had been thrown into prison for a certain rebellion made in the city and for murder.
[time=2025] John's Gospel said that he was a robber. Here it says that he's a murder and an insurrectionist. He's the one who should be here.
[time=2037] This seems very right that he's there. It seems very appropriate. It seems very just.
[time=2045] And so you've got these two people set before the crowd that had gathered. One is obviously guilty, deserving the consequences of his actions.
[time=2054] The other is innocent, obviously not deserving of judgment. This leads us to the verdicts. Those were the findings.
[time=2068] What was the verdict? What was the result of this trial? First Barabbas, then Jesus. Barabbas, can you believe it? He's set free.
[time=2082] He was found to be guilty. But he's set free. He's out of his chains. Can you imagine what he must have been thinking?
[time=2095] Can you imagine how lucky he was feeling, the fact that he had already been in prison and now he's before this crowd and imagining all that he had deserved and understanding what he had done?
[time=2112] Let the chains fall off. And he's free to just walk out and go about his life. And then you have Jesus' verdict.
[time=2130] We read from the harmonies we have him being scourged and whipped. And John says that there was a crown of thorns that was pushed on his head and we know that it was pressed down.
[time=2145] And then we all know far too well the events that were to follow. Because of the verdict that he would carry his own cross after being whipped and scourged.
[time=2159] He would climb the hill to Golgotha and he would be nailed to that cross. And he would die there.
[time=2169] Having been crucified, yes, according to the will of the people, yes, because of the envy of the chief priests but ultimately because the love of the Heavenly Father.
[time=2188] This was unbelievable.
[time=2193] The findings are not in line with the verdicts.
[time=2197] The innocent led away to crucifixion and the guilty walking away to freedom. The irony of all ironies and yet all is in accordance with the Trinity's redemptive plans which were in place before the beginning of time.
[time=2215] Take a moment and watch this video and watch their faces and take it in. I don't know if it's exactly true but it's in accordance with what this says and I'll be back in just a second.
[time=2235] We see the story of Jesus going to the cross and everything seems to kind of be hand in hand. And then there's this one character that seems to interrupt the narrative. It's named Barabbas.
[time=2246] You don't even know much about him except that he's a murderer, a leader of an insurrection, a rebel and why he's even mentioned sometimes I'm not so sure.
[time=2254] It's like what? This is about Jesus going to the cross.
[time=2260] So in this moment, Pilate thinks I hold the destinies of these two men in my hand. I know the Jews have a tradition that on a holy day I will release one of the prisoners on death row.
[time=2272] Pilate stands on this audacious stage who now presents Jesus son of the living God versus Barabbas the thug and rebel.
[time=2283] He says, all right, who do you want? This is blasphemy. This is this is God who fought.
[time=2292] There's no comparison. This is a rightful prisoner, a man who should be on death row.
[time=2299] He's a rebel against Rome. He leads a rebellion. He murders people. He's a bad man. He's a thug and he's a crook.
[time=2307] He deserves the chains and he deserves the crucifixion. Jesus, what has he done but heal, restore, deliver, set free, open blind eyes, open deaf ears, heal the lame and the leper.
[time=2323] What is Jesus done? Who do you want? We will be all Barabbas. Yeah. Give us Barabbas.
[time=2333] People say give us Barabbas. The Roman soldiers come up and they put the key in and they unlock Barabbas from his chains. He shackles and he walks down the platform.
[time=2355] Welcome by all of his thug friends. Yeah, the people love me. Yeah, that's right. I don't even know who this Jesus guy is, but all I know is my people love me.
[time=2364] There seems to be no conscience in Barabbas. There's no record of him turning Jesus and I owe you everything now, for you have set me free now.
[time=2373] I don't see any of that in Barabbas and God knew that. Jesus stood there silent before he knew the will of the Father. He said it's fine Father. Let him have Barabbas.
[time=2386] For Jesus knew that the Father would have to treat Jesus like Barabbas so he could treat Barabbas like Jesus.
[time=2396] Barabbas thought it was the people that set him free. No, no, no, no. It was the love of Heavenly Father.
[time=2410] So we've seen the setting, sought there, portrayed, seen the irony. Quickly this morning, let's look at three implications.
[time=2422] If these events are true, if this narrative really took place in history, if Jesus really was sinless and if he really was condemned to die despite his innocence,
[time=2439] then there are real tangible and practical shockwaves which are still felt today. Let's look at three of them quickly. The first one is this.
[time=2454] Jesus' innocence positions him to be the only viable substitute to pay for someone's sin.
[time=2465] He's the only one. In Hebrews chapter 7 it says this, verse 26, "For such a high priest was fitting for us, talking of Jesus, the one who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and he has become higher than the heavens.
[time=2484] He's the one who does not need daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the peoples. For this he did once for all when he offered up himself.
[time=2497] For the law appoints as high priest men who have weaknesses, but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints the Son Jesus, who has been perfected forever."
[time=2510] See what it said there? He doesn't have to offer sacrifice for his own sin because there was none. And because he's in that position of innocence, of sinlessness, he can stand in the gap for you and for me and be the substitute to take the penalty for our sin. And he's the only one who can do that.
[time=2533] He's the only one who could take my place because he's the only one who never sinned. No one else can do for us what Jesus has done. Everyone else has her or his own sin to pay for.
[time=2548] Only Jesus stands there beaten without deserving the beating, whipped without deserving the whipping, mocked without deserving to be mocked, tortured without deserving the torture, and crucified without deserving to be crucified.
[time=2566] You see the first implication is this, Jesus' innocence positions him to be the only viable substitute to pay for someone's sin.
[time=2576] It leads us to the second implication of this reality. It's this, that God's justice demands, God's justice demands that every sin be paid for.
[time=2592] You see, when we look at Barabbas, we can all relate to him. We are all guilty. We are all deserving the consequences of our own sin and our continual departure from God's ways.
[time=2609] Romans 3 says this, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." And Romans 6 says this.
[time=2617] It says, "The wages of sin is death." You see, every sin will be paid for.
[time=2627] It has to be in order for God to be who he said he was going to be, in order for him to be holy, in order for him to maintain justice, every sin will be paid for.
[time=2643] Every slip of the tongue, every complaining and bitter attitude, every prideful thought, each episode of anger when your kids don't act the way you want, all the times you wish you had, what someone else has, all the selfishness, all the gluttony, all the greed, all the manipulating to get your way.
[time=2661] Every time we do not act when we should, every sin will be paid for.
[time=2672] It's either going to be paid for by Jesus or it'll be paid for by you.
[time=2681] The first implication, Jesus' innocence positions him to be the only viable substitute to pay for someone's sin.
[time=2688] The second implication, God's justice demands that every sin be paid for. This leads to the third.
[time=2697] And that is this, that this reality, that what Christ has accomplished, the irony of all ironies, is the greatest news that has ever been published.
[time=2708] It is the greatest news that you could ever hear, that anyone could ever hear.
[time=2714] There's no better news than the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2721] If you're not a Christian today, listen to this news. Jesus Christ came to earth and lived a perfect life so that he could die in your place if you would simply confess your sin and believe in him.
[time=2739] If you're a Christian today, listen to this news. Jesus Christ came to earth and lived a perfect life so that he could die in your place.
[time=2752] And this truth reaches into every facet of your life. Every relationship you have is impacted by this reality.
[time=2760] If Christ is your substitute, then your current and ongoing relationship with God is not based upon your performance.
[time=2769] It has nothing to do with your ability to earn some type of favor with God.
[time=2774] We're accepted in Christ. We're loved in Christ. We're adopted in Christ. We're cherished in Christ.
[time=2783] Tim Keller said this, "The gospel is what drives everything we do. It's the solution to pretty much every problem.
[time=2791] The gospel is what every theological category should be expounding when we do our systematic theology.
[time=2797] It should be at the heart of everything we do."
[time=2803] We're going to watch the conclusion to that video.
[time=2807] I'm not a big guy about yelling and shouting, although sometimes I get worked up, but he gets a little worked up, so just be prepared.
[time=2814] And then we'll finish with just three final thoughts and then we'll be done.
[time=2819] So pay attention here again, about four minutes.
[time=2824] When I look at the story, I realize who perhaps really is.
[time=2835] That's me. That's you. That's us.
[time=2842] For why we were still sinners. Christ died for us.
[time=2849] God sent his son for Barabbas.
[time=2853] Even the one he knew would walk away from Jesus in his free gift and never come back.
[time=2859] We love him and the nerve to call the audacity of believers to think.
[time=2865] I got saved by grace, but now that I'm in this deep, dark place of bondage, how about a work hard to get myself out?
[time=2874] What?
[time=2876] That's the opposite of the gospel.
[time=2879] Are you bound?
[time=2881] Are you held under the power of this temptation, this sin?
[time=2886] Is it like it's controlling you? What are you going to do?
[time=2890] I'm going to shake myself free. Stop it.
[time=2894] Know you won't.
[time=2896] You're no match for the powers of hell and the urges of Sue will not overcome it and you will never overcome it.
[time=2905] You'll just be another statistic. There's no answer within yourself.
[time=2910] Your own marriage, your own goodness, your own discipline, your own devotion will not save your marriage and will not save your kids. There's only one.
[time=2919] And he's the one that took your place.
[time=2922] He's the one that stood silently on the platform with Pilate and said, "Yes, little man, Barabbas, take me."
[time=2931] How many times have I stood on that platform with Pilate and Jesus?
[time=2935] And I'm the Barabbas and they start to take my chains off and I say, "No, no, I deserve this.
[time=2943] I deserve to kill. I deserve to shame. I deserve the consequence. I deserve it."
[time=2952] God, I'm so ashamed. Give me your shame.
[time=2959] But God, what if I do it again? I'll still be here.
[time=2965] Oh, God, I don't want to hurt you. I love you. I don't want to do this anymore.
[time=2971] Give me your sins.
[time=2978] This is all we got. It's all I got. It's all you got.
[time=2983] We can play games. We can play church games.
[time=2986] We can pretend like some people are better than others and that's why they're blessed.
[time=2989] Or we can all come to the honest conclusion that it's God.
[time=2994] And it's God alone.
[time=2997] The greatest challenge is not your discipline, your devotion, your focus.
[time=3002] Your greatest challenge is believing the gospel. Could it be that there's a God with a love so scandalous, so wide, so deep, so vast, so high, so expansive, so welcoming, so inclusive?
[time=3018] Let me have your sin, son. Okay.
[time=3025] When I give up my sin, let's stand in this empty space of forgiveness and acceptance why Jesus walks off to the cross that I deserve.
[time=3038] I see him. I see him walking to the post to be whipped. As I stand a free man, all the intention is turned now.
[time=3048] And I feel the love of God's same ghost, son, live your life. I'll pay the price.
[time=3055] When we get off thinking that we were going to set ourselves free.
[time=3062] It's still Jesus. It'll always be Jesus. It'll never stop being the power of Jesus.
[time=3069] If his blood is sufficient for your salvation, his blood is sufficient to sustain you through every challenge and every sin and every temptation.
[time=3079] Jesus is enough.
[time=3092] No.
[time=3101] Three final thoughts this morning that I just want you to leave with.
[time=3108] Big day. Big truth.
[time=3114] I want you to go with this. Rejoicing in this that Jesus, number one, Jesus is the spotless, guiltless, blameless, pure, holy lamb of God.
[time=3133] It is his work which allows God's justice to be maintained while at the same time allowing for us to partake in his amazing grace.
[time=3147] Second, this morning, the main call of this passage is to believe.
[time=3158] Why have we spent several weeks on the life of Christ which continues to highlight the same thing over and over and over?
[time=3166] That the sovereign suffering servant came to do for us what we could never do for ourselves because belief is at the heart of the gospel.
[time=3178] There is nothing more practical for your daily life than to believe the gospel.
[time=3188] Mark 1, 15, Jesus says, "The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe in the gospel."
[time=3195] In John 6, he said, "This way, I'm the bread of the life. He who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst."
[time=3205] Romans 4, 5, "But to him who does not work but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, it's his faith that's accounted as righteousness."
[time=3218] Why do we continue to highlight the life of Jesus week after week because it's not as easy to believe as it should be?
[time=3229] Milton Vincent in his little book, The Gospel Primer, says this, "The gospel is so foolish according to my natural wisdom.
[time=3237] It's so scandalous according to my conscience, and it's so incredible to my timid heart that it's a daily battle to believe the full scope of it as I should.
[time=3248] There's no other way to compete with the foreboding of my conscience, the condemning of my heart, and the lies of the world and the devil than to overwhelm such things with daily rehearsings of the gospel."
[time=3264] Believe. And the third thing I want you to understand this morning and to take with you is this, true belief will and must lead to action.
[time=3280] Because if there's no action, the belief is shallow. If you don't know Christ this morning, I ask you to believe in him this morning.
[time=3293] What should come from that belief is a confession that you're guilty and you deserve to pay the penalty for your sin, but you're going to run and trust Christ to be your substitute.
[time=3306] If that's you this morning after the service is over in a few short minutes, we'd love to talk with you this morning.
[time=3313] If you're a Christian this morning, if you've already confessed your sin and your need for the Savior, understand this. The gospel is opposed to earning, but it's not opposed to effort.
[time=3326] The gospel is massively transformational in your life as a Christian.
[time=3333] Let me give you three quick examples. Romans 8 1 says this, "There is now therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. If I believe that there's no condemnation, and I don't have to wallow in self-pity or self-loathing or despair, if I believe there's no condemnation, I don't have to try to fix myself or atone for my own sin or try to earn God's favor.
[time=3358] But if I believe that there's no condemnation because of what Christ has done, I can rejoice in Christ's work. I can run to him, confess and repent."
[time=3369] In Hebrews 10, 19 it says, "Therefore, having boldness to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus, we have confidence through the veil that is His flesh. If I believe that I can enter God's presence through the work of Christ, then I don't have to be scared or afraid.
[time=3387] Or afraid or timid to draw close to Him. I don't have to keep a respectable distance. I can draw near to Him with full assurance and confidence that I'm loved and accepted because I believe in what He's done for me."
[time=3407] James 1, 16 says this, "Do not be deceived, my fellow brethren. Every good and every perfect gift comes down from above from the Father of Lights with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning."
[time=3421] Listen, if I believe that God is a giver of good gifts, then I don't have to be skeptical about what this Bible says.
[time=3432] I can embrace the Word being quick to listen and slow to speak because I know that it's for my good and ultimately for His glory.
[time=3445] You see, belief leads to action. So this morning, would you please understand God has gone to great lengths in order to solidify the historical reality of Jesus' sinlessness and therefore His ability to substitute, to be a substitute for anyone who would believe.
[time=3473] Would you this morning, whether you've heard this for the first time or the thousandth time, would you believe in Him?
[time=3481] And would you allow your belief in His incredible grace to move you to action for His glory so that the world might hear of Him and by God's grace believe in Him as well?
[time=3493] Let's pray this morning. Man, you can come up and we'll sing after I pray. God, oh, thank you so much. God, I wasn't anticipating the emotion that you put in my heart this morning.
[time=3508] But I'm thankful. Pray that it wasn't distracting. Pray that it was honoring to you and God. I pray that you would just again solidify in our hearts the historical reality of Jesus that we would play over and over and over again, the fact that He's not guilty.
[time=3528] We find no guilt in this man because He was not guilty. He is and was and will always be the pure and blameless spotless lamb of God who has taken away my sin and got out of the gratitude of all that you've done for me.
[time=3546] Would you help me to move to action? First and foremost, want to tell everybody about the gospel and then to try to meet needs as I can in this world for your glory and for your honor. Thank you that you are our stronghold. We pray this in Christ's name. Amen.
