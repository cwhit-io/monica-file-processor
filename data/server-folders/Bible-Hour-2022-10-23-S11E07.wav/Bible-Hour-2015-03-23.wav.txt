[time=588] Hosanna in the highest.
[time=589] That's what you are.
[time=590] That's why we're here.
[time=591] Thank you so much that we have things on earth to help us remember in my pathetic brain because I need it.
[time=604] I need times like this, like Palm Sunday celebration, Easter celebration.
[time=609] Thank you so much for that.
[time=611] Thank you for sending your son to die on the cross for me even though I do not deserve it.
[time=619] Thank you for loving us.
[time=621] Thank you for Black Hawk Church.
[time=623] I thank you so much for them.
[time=625] I pray that you bless our church.
[time=628] Please continue to protect our church as we search for the new pastor.
[time=634] I pray for him, I pray Father that all of this is given to you in every way.
[time=642] And I pray Father that we become or continue to be a church that worships you day and night.
[time=659] Well, good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Bible Hour. My name is Steve Webster. I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=665] I'm so glad that you're watching, that you're part of our church family.
[time=670] We're encouraged by your involvement with us in this way and love to be a service to you.
[time=675] We've been doing this as a service to our community for years and years and are so grateful that you've been watching and that you're again a part of our family.
[time=683] If you have been watching for a long time, just let us know. Let us know that you're watching.
[time=689] And better than that, we'd encourage actually come and to be a part.
[time=693] And speaking of that, our service times on Sunday morning are we have a nine o'clock community hour where we connect with each other in smaller settings.
[time=700] It's Sunday school hours, how we would used to refer to it.
[time=703] And our service, our gathering, we have one of those in Sunday morning, it's at 10.30.
[time=708] So if you're watching the broadcast this morning, you can still come be a part of that.
[time=712] And we would want to regularly invite you to that.
[time=715] And this morning is no exception.
[time=717] You're watching this on Easter Sunday morning.
[time=720] So we would encourage you to come be a part of our service.
[time=723] We are really excited about our services today.
[time=725] We would love for you to come to be a part of that.
[time=727] What you're going to see this morning is from a friend of mine, Steve Longbrake, who's been a part of our church family for many, many years.
[time=733] He's been talking about several witnesses around the death of Jesus and what that represents.
[time=739] So I can't wait for you to hear from him. I'm excited about it.
[time=742] If you have missed any of our messages or you want to kind of look back and see where we've been over the last several months, we encourage you to go to our website to blackhuckministries.org and then backslash messages.
[time=753] You can listen to the music.
[time=755] You can watch our sermon series.
[time=757] We have worked hard to providing you with this service.
[time=760] There's a transcript in many cases of the actual service that day for you to read if you'd like to.
[time=765] So we have a team of people that labor diligently to make those things available to you.
[time=769] And we're so glad to be able to do that.
[time=773] Our student ministries, we want to just keep the word out on our student ministries.
[time=777] We call them liquid.
[time=779] Liquid is our junior high or middle school ministry.
[time=782] And 212 is our high school ministry.
[time=784] And Judy and Dre Baker lead both those and we're so grateful for them.
[time=788] They've been a personal encouragement to me over the years on many, many different fronts.
[time=792] And they would love to be a blessing to your kids.
[time=795] They meet Sunday mornings from 9 to 10, 15.
[time=797] And then on Wednesday nights that liquid kids meet from 7 to 8, 30.
[time=802] And then 212 beats from 7, 30 to 9.
[time=804] That might be changing coming up in the near future.
[time=806] But again, liquid meets Wednesday nights from 7 to 8, 30 to 12 from 7, 30 to 9.
[time=811] So come and invite your kids to come.
[time=814] Being a student in today's climate is not easy.
[time=818] And Judy and Dre, Judy and Dre would love to be a ministry and a blessing to your family, especially to your kids in this regard.
[time=825] So I encourage you to come and see.
[time=827] Come and be a part of it.
[time=828] Lastly this morning, we wanted to encourage you.
[time=831] If you've been a longtime friend of the Bible, or there is an opportunity for you to give in an ongoing way to this ministry
[time=837] by being a part of what we would call the Founders Club.
[time=840] Founders Club is a way for you to make a monthly donation to be a part of supporting this ministry in an ongoing way.
[time=846] We are grateful for the people that have partnered with us for years and years, as I mentioned earlier, in the broadcast to provide this service to you and to our community.
[time=854] And the Founders Club is a way for you if you've been benefiting from this for years.
[time=858] And a lot of you tell us, a lot of the time, that you have been.
[time=862] It would be a great blessing to us if you could partner with us in that way.
[time=866] So please conduct that number and more information will be coming your way on what it means to be part of the Founders Club and how you can be a service to us regarding putting this broadcast out so that you can be encouraged.
[time=878] And we can be a blessing and encouragement to our community.
[time=882] As always friends, thank you for watching. Thank you for being part of our church family.
[time=886] Be encouraged by what you see today.
[time=888] And as always come and visit us, come say hello, have a great week, and God bless.
[time=906] Here we go.
[time=935] [MUSIC - 228 seconds]
[time=1165] "Hosanna" means save, rescue, savior. He's the only one that could rescue us.
[time=1179] And they praised him and they shouted "Hosanna" because some of them realized they needed a savior and Jesus is their savior.
[time=1191] Some of them didn't. Some of them didn't.
[time=1196] We come here this morning on what we call Palm Sunday, kind of to initiate a week that took place.
[time=1204] Palm Sunday, they did those kinds of things. They did greet him. He did come in on a cult in the town.
[time=1211] And they did worship him, some of them.
[time=1215] Some of them did recognize a little bit about who he was.
[time=1219] I don't think anybody fully understood who he was, who he is.
[time=1225] And then it began a week of really amazing, incredible events that took place that we've been looking at that the snapshots reflect for us.
[time=1240] And we had and have information about what he did and who he was and who he is as he moved through that week.
[time=1256] And this morning we get to Luke chapter 23 verses 26 through 43.
[time=1265] And it's a hard day. It's not Palm Sunday.
[time=1274] It's not people recognizing him for who he is.
[time=1281] It's Friday.
[time=1285] And it's a hard, hard day for him.
[time=1292] And an incredibly good day for us.
[time=1299] Luke 23, 26, "As they led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.
[time=1318] A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him.
[time=1326] Jesus turned and said to them, 'Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, weep for yourselves and for your children.
[time=1337] For the time will come when you will say, 'Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'
[time=1348] Then they will say to the mountains, 'Fall on us and to the hills, cover us.
[time=1356] For if men do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?'"
[time=1366] Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed.
[time=1371] When they came to the place called the skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals.
[time=1379] One on his right, the other on his left.
[time=1383] Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.'
[time=1390] And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
[time=1397] The people stood watching and the rulers even sneered at him.
[time=1401] They said, 'He saved others, let him save himself.' If he is the Christ of God, the chosen one, the soldiers also came up and mocked him.
[time=1416] They offered him wine vinegar and said, 'If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.'
[time=1426] There was a written notice above him which read, 'This is the king of the Jews.'
[time=1433] One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him, 'Aren't you the Christ, save yourself and us?'
[time=1446] But the other criminal rebuked him, 'Don't you fear God,' he said, 'Since you are under the same sentence,
[time=1457] we are punished justly for we are getting what our deeds deserve, but this man has done nothing wrong.'
[time=1466] Then he said, 'Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.'
[time=1476] Jesus answered him, 'I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.'
[time=1488] Lord, this is not the same thing for me that it is for others.
[time=1495] It is not the same thing for a person sitting right beside these folks right now.
[time=1500] You may have something very unique from this passage for each of us, and there are themes, Lord, that I am sure we are all going to have in common.
[time=1515] Would you please help us sort through that, Lord?
[time=1520] Would you please give us wisdom from above?
[time=1523] I pray that your spirit would enable us to understand what your words say as you reveal them to us.
[time=1530] Help us to understand exactly what they mean for us, our heart.
[time=1534] Help us discern the thoughts and attitudes of our own heart as we rightly divide your living word.
[time=1542] Please, Lord, help us.
[time=1545] We are desperately in need of you in order to understand what you want us to understand.
[time=1551] I pray you'd empower us by your spirit, and then we'd walk out of here, energized knowing and doing whatever it is you want us to know and do, please.
[time=1562] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1567] Well, from Pilate to the Cross, last week Pilate washed his hands, and we heard great message.
[time=1579] We've heard some great messages these past months.
[time=1582] I have been thrilled with what we've been taught.
[time=1586] I'm so thankful for what the other men have been teaching.
[time=1590] I've learned a lot.
[time=1592] And last week we ended with Jesus leaving Pilate and heading for the Cross.
[time=1605] They led him away, it said there.
[time=1608] They seized Simon the Cyrene.
[time=1612] Cyrene was a really interesting port city in northern Africa, just west of ancient Egypt and Libya now today.
[time=1621] Directly below Greece, and so the Greeks had established this city, and then later many Jews had been transported from Israel into that city, and there were a lot of Jews living there then.
[time=1635] Simon's probably one of those, and often they would come back to Jerusalem, and for Passover many people made this trek.
[time=1644] And so Simon the Cyrene coming from northern Africa, traveling all the way to Jerusalem to get there.
[time=1652] And he's on his way in to celebrate Passover, and what happens to him, they grab him, and they say to him, they seize him it says.
[time=1661] And they forced him to pick up the Cross that Jesus was carrying, and follow Jesus with Jesus Cross.
[time=1673] That's not all we know about this guy.
[time=1677] There's a lot of speculation about him, about who his sons might have been, about the possibility that he came to Christ through this event, but we don't know it.
[time=1690] What we do know is this.
[time=1692] He's coming from outside of town.
[time=1694] He's coming from a far distance, and he's finally arriving, he gets there, and he gets stopped, and now it's time for him to carry the Cross.
[time=1704] Can you imagine?
[time=1709] I'm on my way to something, I don't want to be interrupted by anything.
[time=1713] Let alone work, and they make him carry that Cross.
[time=1720] And what of you he had, Jesus having been beaten, scourged, barely able to carry that Cross, now in front of him, and he's following.
[time=1738] Then there were people there that were following, it says many people in the text.
[time=1746] There were women who were mourning and wailing, and Jesus said to them, daughters of Jerusalem, don't weep and wail for me.
[time=1759] Weep and wail for yourselves, because this is the beginning of something that's going to transpire later that's going to be really miserable for all people who haven't received me as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[time=1776] He quotes Hosea, chapter 10, they'll say to the mountains, fall on us, they'll say to the hills, cover us up so that we can avoid this wrath that we're experiencing.
[time=1797] He said pray for them, weep and wail for them.
[time=1805] For if men do these kinds of things he says, when the trees green, when things are going pretty well, they do things like perhaps he's talking about, do things like hang the innocent on a cross to die.
[time=1823] When people are being cruel and vicious and struggling, when the tree is green, what's it going to be like when the drought comes?
[time=1836] We'll sing about that in a little bit with the team.
[time=1841] Then there are two criminals there.
[time=1846] There are two criminals, that word criminal I looked it up, it's about somebody who's bad.
[time=1853] I mean they did nasty things, it wasn't like they pilfered something that day and got caught, they'd been living a life of crime, often murder wrapped up in that word.
[time=1869] And these two come along with him and they get crucified one on his right and one on his left.
[time=1881] And they put those nails in our Savior.
[time=1885] It's interesting, you don't know that from the Gospels.
[time=1889] It doesn't say anything about them putting nails in it.
[time=1892] We know that because Thomas said, I need to see the nails in your hands and your feet.
[time=1899] So we know he got nailed to that cross.
[time=1902] We read a lot about crucifixion this week, awful way to die.
[time=1907] They nailed him, they laid him down on that cross, they put nails through his feet and his hands, they probably tied him up there too.
[time=1917] And then they put that cross at an angle into the hole and leaned it up and it drops into the hole.
[time=1931] And he's got one who deserves it on his right and one who deserves it on his left and he's totally innocent in the middle.
[time=1949] And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, they don't know what they're doing.
[time=1960] Can you imagine that being the words that come out of your mouth when you've been nailed to the cross?
[time=1965] And you're the one that got jarred when the thing hit the bottom of the hole?
[time=1970] I can't imagine that.
[time=1972] But his thoughts are about what God had commanded the Jews to do and what he'd been doing from his birth.
[time=1982] And that was to love the Lord God with all his heart, mind, soul and strength and to love his neighbor as himself.
[time=1992] And he did it hanging on that cross too.
[time=1994] Remember earlier that week, he said, if there's a different way to do this, Father, if there's some other way, I don't want to do that.
[time=2005] It says he sweat like drops of blood, it was so intense, he knew what was coming, he didn't want to do it that way.
[time=2012] Is there some other way?
[time=2014] But the answer from the Father was, no, this is the way.
[time=2019] And so once again, he submits to the Father and hangs on that cross.
[time=2030] Then they, it says, don't know who they were, they divided up his clothes, cast lots for them.
[time=2039] People watched as that happened, it says.
[time=2043] Rulers sneered as that happened, as he's saying, Father, please forgive them, they don't know what they're doing, they're sneering at him.
[time=2057] The soldiers mocked him and they gave him wine vinegar and they said, oh, you're the king, save yourself, king.
[time=2071] And criminal one did the same thing.
[time=2076] He said, why don't you save yourself and us if you have the ability to do that.
[time=2083] And criminal two said, we deserve everything that's happening to us and he's innocent.
[time=2095] And then he says, please remember me today.
[time=2102] When you come into your kingdom, would you please remember me?
[time=2109] And Jesus, who's the only one that could, turns to him.
[time=2116] Now get this, that guy on the cross, when he's speaking to the other criminal, he's talking across Jesus, right?
[time=2124] Don't know if he was on the left or the right, but whichever side he was on, he's talking through Jesus to him.
[time=2130] But then he directs his attention to Jesus.
[time=2134] And Jesus says to him, today you will be with me today.
[time=2148] Participants on the way, I just walked through them.
[time=2152] When they're on the way to the skull, to Golgotha, Simon the Cyrene shows up there and he's on the way.
[time=2164] He's on the way to Jerusalem.
[time=2167] He's been on the way for a while.
[time=2169] It takes a while to get from Cyrene to Jerusalem.
[time=2175] He's been on the way.
[time=2181] Just on his way into town.
[time=2186] And his way gets altered.
[time=2189] And instead of going this direction, now his way is altered and he's forced to go this direction, back out of town.
[time=2201] Large numbers of people were also on the way.
[time=2209] They didn't know that the sovereign suffering Savior who has come to do for us what we couldn't do for ourselves.
[time=2220] They didn't know they were following him.
[time=2225] They just were caught up in the event and they're on the way with the event like a lot of people are today.
[time=2235] And those women were focused on the present.
[time=2243] And Jesus is saying, "Don't weep and wail for me." He knows how significant the present is.
[time=2252] He knows what it means for the future.
[time=2254] And he says to them, "No, weep and wail for those in the future." Because there's a burden coming because they've rejected me that will be incredible in heart.
[time=2269] Then in 28 to 31, Jesus speaks to them and he says, "Hosea prophesied," I'll quote it to you.
[time=2282] You know that passage of Scripture about the rocks falling on you and the hills?
[time=2287] The other time that shows up that's very similar is there in Revelation.
[time=2292] In Revelation when remember the seals couldn't be open and finally Jesus opens those seals, remember the seals?
[time=2300] Those scrolls couldn't be open.
[time=2302] Well, there are seven seals.
[time=2304] And in Revelation chapter 6 verses 12 through 17, the sixth of the seven seals are open.
[time=2311] In fact, they're in your Bible, would you please? Revelation chapter 6 verse 12.
[time=2317] Last book in your New Testament to the right.
[time=2323] 6-12 it says, "I watched as he opened the sixth seal, there was a great earthquake.
[time=2328] The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair.
[time=2331] The whole moon turned blood red.
[time=2333] And the stars in the sky fell to the earth as late figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind."
[time=2340] The sky receded like a scroll rolling up and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
[time=2346] Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and every slave and every free man hid in caves
[time=2354] and among the rocks of the mountains.
[time=2357] They called to the mountains and the rocks.
[time=2359] Follow on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb
[time=2368] for the great day of their wrath has come and who can stand.
[time=2377] People will be begging to be able to avoid, let the rocks fall on me.
[time=2383] I'd rather have that than face the judgment that they're due, that we're due, that I'm due in my natural condition.
[time=2399] Then at the cross.
[time=2402] There are participants at the cross, verse 32 to 43.
[time=2406] There are two other men, they're criminals.
[time=2409] There was one on his right, one on his left.
[time=2411] There's Jesus, who says, "Father, forgive them while he's hanging there." There are the people that watched, the rulers that sneered, the soldiers that mocked.
[time=2427] There was a sign hung on him.
[time=2429] You know what, it wasn't the whole truth, but it was true.
[time=2435] He said he was the king of the Jews, he is.
[time=2440] He's the king of all, that's the truth.
[time=2444] He's the king of kings and he's the Lord of lords.
[time=2447] The sign was true, it just didn't tell the whole truth, but one day.
[time=2454] One day, every knee shall bow and every tongue confess, realizing that he's the truth, he's the king.
[time=2464] He's the Lord, he's my Savior, and he's ushering me into a relationship with him that's going to last forever.
[time=2472] It was true, he was king of the Jews, just didn't tell the whole truth.
[time=2485] Verse 39, one of those criminals joined the rulers and the soldiers.
[time=2490] He said, "Yeah, aren't you the Christ? Save yourself, and us." Verse 40 and 41, "Across Jesus, that other criminal reacts to that and says to him,
[time=2508] "You and I deserve everything we're getting." Now listen to me.
[time=2514] You and I deserve everything that we would get in that judgment when people are hiding from the judge.
[time=2524] You and I deserve everything we would get.
[time=2529] And he says that to that other thief, and the other thief doesn't get it, but he does.
[time=2535] And he turns then to Jesus himself. Can you imagine?
[time=2538] I don't know how far apart they were, but can you imagine?
[time=2541] Turning your head on a cross and having him turn his face toward you on that cross.
[time=2549] And you say to him, "I believe." I believe, and he says to you, "Today you will be with me in paradise."
[time=2569] Paradise.
[time=2576] All of us like Simon, the Cyrene, are on the way.
[time=2588] All of us like those followers are on the way.
[time=2594] You're on the way somewhere today.
[time=2597] You're on the way somewhere in your life as you walk through your life.
[time=2602] You are on the way. Paul said he was on a way too.
[time=2608] They're in Philippians. He said, "Here's the way I'm headed.
[time=2612] I'm headed heavenward." That's the direction I'm going.
[time=2617] My life on this earth is a progression of steps attached to my Savior who I'm going to be like someday.
[time=2626] And I'm on the way toward him and where he is.
[time=2631] We're all on the way somewhere.
[time=2636] All of us like the women are naturally focused on the temporal and the present.
[time=2644] All of us are naturally focused on today.
[time=2651] And maybe what happened in the past that caused the things of today.
[time=2654] And maybe the fear that we have about what's coming in the future.
[time=2657] All of us are focused on temporal things the way those women were focused on the present and temporal things.
[time=2665] In our natural condition, that's who we are.
[time=2669] All of us like the thieves are guilty, completely guilty of our sin.
[time=2679] My disregard for the maker of heaven and earth.
[time=2688] My rejection of his mandates.
[time=2696] My pretending that he doesn't know is worse than any of the crimes that those criminals committed.
[time=2708] I'm guilty.
[time=2715] All of us like the soldiers have mocked God in our selfish behavior pretending that he isn't there.
[time=2729] None of us are like Jesus.
[time=2738] He's the sinless, innocent one.
[time=2743] He's the sovereign, suffering servant that we've been talking about that's totally innocent.
[time=2748] The only lamb that could have been slain for you and for me.
[time=2753] He's the only one that could come and do for us what we couldn't do for ourselves.
[time=2757] You can't get there anyway except through his blood.
[time=2765] None of us are like him.
[time=2767] None of us are the innocent ones.
[time=2772] None of us are sinless.
[time=2774] None of us are the sovereign, suffering servant who's able to do for us what we can't do for ourselves.
[time=2781] Nobody in this room can do that.
[time=2783] Nobody back here, especially you.
[time=2793] He's the participant unlike any of the other participants.
[time=2800] He's nothing like them.
[time=2803] He's the only one.
[time=2806] He's the participant that was able to participate in something that could save all the participants.
[time=2814] Nobody else could.
[time=2822] He participated by choice to submit to his father for each one of us.
[time=2830] And we need him.
[time=2833] We're desperate for him. There's no other way.
[time=2836] He's the only way.
[time=2837] He's the way, the truth, and the life.
[time=2840] And nobody comes to the father except through him.
[time=2845] And we get to come to the father.
[time=2852] We don't have to cry for those rocks.
[time=2855] We don't have to be hidden by the hills.
[time=2858] We can boldly come before his throne, he says, and get this.
[time=2863] He says, I am going to be like him.
[time=2868] Can you believe it?
[time=2870] You are becoming like him and one day when we are with him.
[time=2877] When we see him face to face, the Bible says we're going to be like him.
[time=2883] His innocence, ours.
[time=2891] His righteousness, ours.
[time=2896] We'll be able to stand boldly before the throne of the maker of heaven and earth, the one to whom we have rejected.
[time=2908] We'll be able to stand there, not because for some reason we start to do it right eventually, no, because Jesus paid for it.
[time=2922] He's the one.
[time=2923] He's the only participant that could do that.
[time=2926] For them, everybody that was there, everybody that was there, and for us.
[time=2933] Well are you like that thief or that one?
[time=2938] That's a good question to ask today.
[time=2944] One of those thieves died separated from our God forever as far as we know.
[time=2952] And that other one joined the very person who was shedding blood for him at that moment in his kingdom forever.
[time=2968] Do you believe?
[time=2976] If you believe, he says, then you'll be different.
[time=2981] There'll be evidence of your belief, and you can rest in faith in his grace and his blood.
[time=2990] [AMEN - 2 seconds]
[time=3006] [MUSIC]
[time=3185] Filled with wonder I struck wonder at the mention of your name.
[time=3200] Jesus, your name is power.
[time=3204] Heaven's living water such an orphan's misery.
[time=3213] [MUSIC]
[time=3315] Praise God.
[time=3317] [MUSIC]
[time=3355] When the darkness closes in the Lord, still I will say.
[time=3362] Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be your name.
[time=3379] Blessed be your name, when the sun's shining down on me.
[time=3386] When the world falls, as it should be, blessed be your name.
[time=3394] Blessed be your name, on the road marked with suffering.
[time=3399] You'll there's pain in the opera, blessed be your name.
[time=3408] Every blessing you pour out out, turn back to praise.
[time=3415] When the darkness closes in the Lord, still I will say.
[time=3421] Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be your name.
[time=3451] You give and take away, you do and take away.
[time=3458] My heart will choose to say.
[time=3462] Blessed be your name, you do and take away.
[time=3469] We give and take away, my heart will choose to say.
[time=3476] Blessed be your name, blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be your glorious name.
[time=3493] Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be your name.
