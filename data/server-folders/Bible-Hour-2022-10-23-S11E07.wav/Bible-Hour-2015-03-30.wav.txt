[time=394] Well, good morning, everybody.
[time=396] Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=398] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=399] I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Recognition.
[time=401] This is my friend, Judy Baker.
[time=402] Thank you.
[time=403] Good morning.
[time=404] Judy and his wife, Dre, give headship to our student ministries.
[time=406] I'm so glad to be with you today.
[time=408] We have a couple things to tell you about that we're excited about.
[time=410] Thank you, as we often do, for being part of our family.
[time=412] Thanks for watching.
[time=413] Because you're watching, if you're watching on Sunday morning, you can still come be part of our gathering.
[time=418] These days here at Black Hawk, we have a net o'clock, like a Sunday school hour.
[time=421] Yeah, absolutely.
[time=422] And then at 10.30, the time that we gathered together, it's our one gathering service time at 10.30.
[time=427] So you can still come be a part of that gathering to be physically with us in the room.
[time=431] We always want to encourage you to come do that.
[time=434] And today is no exception.
[time=435] So please come do that.
[time=437] If you're looking to kind of go back and look at some older messages, older sermon series going back quite a ways, actually.
[time=443] You can go to our website and look at the messages under the media tab.
[time=448] You can look at the messages there.
[time=449] The link is right there before you're on the screen.
[time=451] We're encouraged to go check that out because there's a huge amount of resources there from our teaching team going back most of last year.
[time=457] Our next sermon series is going to be called Unashamed.
[time=460] There's nothing more exciting than for us to hear about what God has done in people's lives to bring transformation, to change them forever.
[time=467] I wanted to talk a little bit with you, Judy, about what you guys have planned to do in the student ministries regarding Unashamed.
[time=472] It tells a little bit more about the series itself.
[time=474] Absolutely.
[time=475] Yeah.
[time=476] The student ministries at Black Hawk will be going right alongside the adult ministries and going through this Unashamed series.
[time=482] The Unashamed series is really a series to kind of inspire us, to motivate us, to not be ashamed about the gospel, the good news.
[time=490] People are sharing their stories.
[time=492] We're going to hear other people's stories, just redemptive stories on how they came to know Christ.
[time=497] We're going to be learning a better way and how we share the gospel better.
[time=501] Students are going to be going alongside adult ministries and they can talk with their parents at home.
[time=505] We're really excited about it.
[time=506] When do you guys meet for your student ministry stuff?
[time=508] Did you walk us to that real quick?
[time=509] Yeah, if you have a child at home, 6th grade, all the way through 12th grade, we meet every Sunday morning at 9 o'clock and you can find more information out by going to BlackhawkMinistries.org.
[time=519] You can also call me at the church 493-7400, extension 274.
[time=524] 274.
[time=526] We also have Wednesday night meetings as well for middle school and high school.
[time=530] 9 o'clock Sunday morning, though.
[time=532] It'd be great to have them.
[time=534] We have a great team.
[time=535] We have a great team that love kids.
[time=537] Awesome.
[time=538] We would love for your student to be a part of our ministries.
[time=540] Student ministry at Blackhawk.
[time=541] I'll give my story a little bit.
[time=543] My daughter Hannah is in junior high.
[time=545] Yes.
[time=546] She's in junior high.
[time=547] She's 12 and she comes back and tells us all the time things she's learning and the community she's a part of.
[time=552] So thanks for doing that, Diddy.
[time=553] Thanks for creating a place for my daughter that's safe, that she can learn and be with people and really kind of dream.
[time=559] Thanks for coming alongside us and doing that.
[time=561] Yeah, we love you.
[time=562] We love you.
[time=563] Absolutely.
[time=564] Thank you guys for watching the Bible R. Thanks for being a part of our family.
[time=567] We hope you have a great week and that you're encouraged by what you hear today.
[time=570] So thanks for both of us and God bless.
[time=594] (Music)
[time=622] [AMEN] (Applause)
[time=630] (Music)
[time=903] (Applause)
[time=917] (Music)
[time=1084] Yeah, in my heart, the battle was raging. Not all prisoners of war had come home.
[time=1107] These were battlefields of my own making. I didn't know that the war had been war.
[time=1127] Oh, can I heard that the king of the ages, he had fought all life's battles for me.
[time=1148] And victory, victory is mine for the claiming. And now, praise its name, I'm free.
[time=1167] In its finish, the battle is over. In its finish, there will be none alone.
[time=1186] In its finish, the end of the conference. In its finish, and Jesus is Lord.
[time=1206] The love is finished, and Jesus is Lord. Jesus is Lord.
[time=1231] (Applause)
[time=1239] Good morning. Good morning. There we go. I want to tell you a story real quick. Katie, it's not on the sheet.
[time=1249] Last weekend, the raiders weren't here. The raiders were down in Indianapolis at the high school state basketball championships.
[time=1259] In four different games, we heard all of these high school kids yell the exact same cheer.
[time=1267] They yell the exact same cheer from both teams, often at the beginning of the game.
[time=1274] And it went something like this. I believe. I believe that. I believe that we will. I believe what?
[time=1285] I believe that we will win. But the truth is, this morning, I believe that he has won.
[time=1293] The greatest victory that it was ever achieved, the greatest thing that ever happened.
[time=1298] I believe that he has won. Do you believe that? Do you?
[time=1306] See, because there are people here this morning, and we're really thankful.
[time=1310] If you're joining us today on the Bible Hour, if you're joining us today, live stream,
[time=1316] if you're in this sanctuary for the first time today, we are really, truly thankful that you've come today.
[time=1323] We really are, that you would value Easter, that you would bring it here and come, and join us for this.
[time=1331] My name's Rick. I'm one of the elders here, and I'm really privileged to bring the gospel to you today.
[time=1337] It is that. It is the gospel. Another word. The good news.
[time=1342] The good news that he has risen. We're just saying this. He's alive, alive, alive, hallelujah.
[time=1349] A live praise and glory to the lion. A live forever. A man. He's alive forever. A man.
[time=1357] That's why we're here. That's why we're here.
[time=1363] Because we believe that Jesus died and rose again.
[time=1368] I've got to get out my notes and start there because if I don't, we'll go a lot of places.
[time=1376] Amen. Amen.
[time=1382] We trust this morning that the Holy Spirit is with you, with me, and in this place.
[time=1389] The Godhead is present, and there will be things said.
[time=1396] There have already been things sung that are stirring in your heart, and asking you to believe.
[time=1403] We've sang it so many times. Believe.
[time=1407] Believe.
[time=1410] We trust that the Holy Spirit will really use our time together for his purposes.
[time=1414] Let's pray right now. Join me in prayer as we ask him to do exactly that.
[time=1420] Heavenly Father, we just beg you.
[time=1425] Not that you be here because you are.
[time=1430] You're with us. You are a manual God with us.
[time=1435] God, we would beg that you Holy Spirit.
[time=1439] Would speak through me through your Word, not through Rick.
[time=1445] I've been singing it all morning. Spirit of the living God, fall fresh, not on me, if everyone.
[time=1452] Melt us, mold us, fill us God and use us today.
[time=1459] Use your word, use this teaching to make a difference, to bring hope for eternity for everyone that sits here today.
[time=1468] You trust you Jesus. You are good, and you have won the victory.
[time=1473] It's in your name we pray. Amen.
[time=1477] Some of you are actually here today because you were told to come.
[time=1482] Some of you are here because you were told to come and you needed to come.
[time=1486] Some of you are here against your own good judgment, but you came.
[time=1493] Some of you are here because just going to church on Easter is the right thing to do.
[time=1500] It's just what you do on Easter.
[time=1505] But today, maybe you're sitting there. Maybe you're sitting there and you've had a week.
[time=1514] And you're saying, what in the world is all the hoop lyric?
[time=1518] Why all the celebration? Why does it matter to me?
[time=1522] When I've got a wife that doesn't want to be married to me anymore.
[time=1527] When I've got kids that don't want to be around mom and dad.
[time=1535] When I don't know how to stop drinking, snort and huffing, you fill in the blank, clicking where I shouldn't belong.
[time=1547] I don't receive any love from my mom and dad. All I do is criticize me.
[time=1554] I'm lonely.
[time=1558] My husband passed away. My wife passed away. I'm by myself.
[time=1566] I'm full of shame. I'm full of pain. I'm lonely.
[time=1570] Why in the world does the gospel of Jesus Christ bring me any hope today?
[time=1575] Why is everybody singing so loud? Why is everybody excited? Why does it matter?
[time=1583] I submit to you today, this morning, that when you consider the scriptures, we're already saying it.
[time=1591] It's the true and better. It's not a disconnected story.
[time=1595] When you consider the scriptures this morning and what Jesus himself said in addition to the scriptures,
[time=1602] you arrive at a spot where Josh McDowell has articulated for years. He said it for many years.
[time=1608] He's either a liar. He's either a liar because you can't believe a word he says because he says it really clear.
[time=1616] He's either a lunatic and crazy to say somebody that he is and not be that. He's so deceived.
[time=1624] Or he's really who he said he is, the Lord. The Lord sovereign one of the universe.
[time=1633] Let me be really clear. This is a passage from Scripture just so that you don't miss it.
[time=1638] Don't miss because there's some in our culture today that just say Jesus was a good teacher.
[time=1643] He's not. You can't. You can't get there.
[time=1647] Listen to what he said. The chief priests and Pharisees all said they ask him a specific question.
[time=1652] Are you then? Listen to the phrase. The son of God.
[time=1659] That's pretty clear, isn't it? Are you then the son of God? So he said to them, you rightly say that I am.
[time=1667] Don't be confused. Don't be confused at all. They said this, what further testimony do we need?
[time=1675] For we have heard it ourselves from his own mouth. And guess what they did?
[time=1683] They began to plot to killing. Don't be confused. Are you the son of God?
[time=1693] You're right when you say that I am. Wow. And they decide they're going to kill him.
[time=1700] And guess what? They do. Since Jesus specifically said that these things had to happen.
[time=1707] And they really did. Think of all the people. People all predicted all kinds of things.
[time=1712] Jesus said things had to happen. And guess what? They did. We're going to talk about today.
[time=1717] There are many of spoke things that have never come true.
[time=1721] The things which he said had to happen and subsequently did put him in a spot in a place.
[time=1729] That no one, no one else in the history that ever walked this earth can do. Nobody.
[time=1737] It establishes a solid foundation on two things. Number one, the things that he says are trustworthy and he is faithful.
[time=1746] You can believe him. The second is, is that he has power. He has power to make things different.
[time=1756] So when he says in Matthew 11, 28 and 29, when he says, come to me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you what? Rest.
[time=1775] Take my yoke upon me, on you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest from your souls, for your souls.
[time=1787] He says that really clear. You can be confident that when he's prompting you today to bring all your cares and burdens to him,
[time=1801] that he has the power to bring you rest, to bring you rest and to bring you hope,
[time=1808] the resurrection and Easter are pivotal, pivotal components proving that Jesus has the power to do for us what we can't do for ourselves.
[time=1820] We've set it for weeks. Jesus came as the sovereign suffering servant to do for us what we can't do for ourselves.
[time=1830] Today we're going to look at the gospel and some specifics regarding the resurrection and a defining moment of the gospel.
[time=1838] It is the good news. We're going to talk about why Jesus said it had to occur, where we are without the resurrection,
[time=1847] and the resurrection's placed in the gospel life of Jesus. Flip with me to Luke chapter 24. That's our passage for today.
[time=1855] Luke chapter 24 verses 1 through 12.
[time=1860] On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the woman took spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.
[time=1867] They found the stone, rolled away from the tomb, but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
[time=1874] While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.
[time=1883] In their fright, the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them,
[time=1890] "Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here. He has risen.
[time=1897] Remember how he told you. While he was still with you in Galilee, the son of man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners."
[time=1906] He said it, "Be crucified and on the third day rise again." They remembered his words.
[time=1914] When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the eleven and to the others.
[time=1919] It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles.
[time=1926] But they did not believe the women because their words seemed too much like nonsense to them.
[time=1933] Peter got up and ran to the tomb, bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away wondering to himself what happened.
[time=1945] We've already heard it. The Bible is not a series of disconnected stories. It's not.
[time=1951] The scriptures say it really clear that he had to come and he had to suffer.
[time=1956] The first fill in the blank in your bulletin, the first bulletin bullet, is Jesus had told them the resurrection must happen.
[time=1966] The resurrection must happen. Verse 7, it said that. It says it again in Luke 9, 22.
[time=1974] And he said, "The son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed.
[time=1985] And on the third day rise again." This gets to the core of Jesus being trustworthy.
[time=1993] If he said it must happen and then it did, well, it really matters.
[time=2001] How valuable is it when he says, "Suffer, be buried, rise again"?
[time=2007] Don't be mistaken either. Even his enemies understood his statements. That's the next bullet there.
[time=2015] Even his enemies remembered. Matthew 27, 62 to 66. The next day, the one after the preparation day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to pilot.
[time=2027] Sir, they said, "We remember that while he was still alive, the deceiver said, after three days I'll rise again."
[time=2038] So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead.
[time=2047] This last deception will be worse than the first. Did you catch that? They heard what he said and they understood the implications of his being raised from the dead.
[time=2058] Pilot says, "Take a guard, go make the tomb as secure as you know how."
[time=2068] My guess is they did that. They did that. The Roman soldiers, if they didn't do that, they lost their lives for not carrying out their duty.
[time=2079] They knew the implication would make the resurrection bigger than just his life and his death.
[time=2086] The next fill in the blank is, without the resurrection, without it, without the resurrection, Jesus is just another dead guy.
[time=2099] Those are two bullets in one right there. Without the resurrection, Jesus is just another dead man.
[time=2107] You can go to the green dome at the mosque of the prophet in Saudi Arabia and you can see where Mohammed's at.
[time=2116] You can go there. It's a dead man's tomb. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, they are buried.
[time=2125] They are buried at the tomb of the patriarchs in Hebron with their wives. Dead man's bones are there.
[time=2136] Mormonism's Joseph Smith got all kinds of messages, but he was shot and killed and buried in Illinois. He's dead.
[time=2149] Without the resurrection, Jesus is just another dead guy.
[time=2160] The next fill in the blank there is, without the resurrection, your faith and my preaching.
[time=2167] Steve Webster's, Steve Longbrakes, Josh Rings is in vain.
[time=2172] Without the resurrection, your faith and our preaching is worthless.
[time=2178] Flip with me to 1 Corinthians 15. 1 Corinthians 15, 12 through 19.
[time=2184] I can't say this any better. The word just says it really clear.
[time=2188] 1 Corinthians 15, 12 through 19.
[time=2192] Now, if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection from the dead?
[time=2201] But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.
[time=2207] Verse 14, "And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain."
[time=2214] We are even found to be misrepresenting God. Do you understand that?
[time=2218] If he's not raised from the dead, I'm standing up here as a liar this morning.
[time=2228] We are even found to be misrepresenting God because we testified about God that he raised Christ,
[time=2234] whom he did not raise if it's true that the dead are not raised.
[time=2237] Verse 16, "For if the dead are not raised, even Christ has not been raised, and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile, and you are here's a key phrase.
[time=2249] You are still in your sins." I am still in my sins if that sacrifice isn't real.
[time=2261] Then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. Verse 19.
[time=2266] If we, if in Christ, we have hope in this life only, in the here and now.
[time=2274] If we have hope in the here and now only, then we are most of all, what's the word?
[time=2279] To be pitied.
[time=2283] We're most of all to be pitied.
[time=2285] See, there's over 2 billion people in the world today that believe that Jesus was raised from the dead.
[time=2293] There are 2 billion Christians in the world today that find, you can talk about Catholic, you can talk about men.
[time=2300] They believe that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead.
[time=2305] 2 billion people over 2,000 years.
[time=2311] Trust me, if it wasn't real, we'd know it by now.
[time=2319] The true and better Adam, the true and better Joseph Moses, and it points to Jesus.
[time=2327] Let's talk about what we really have in the resurrection now.
[time=2330] The next bullet, in the resurrection Jesus completes, Jesus completes the gospel message.
[time=2338] And it's a story, it's woven a beautiful tapestry.
[time=2342] The first fill in the blank there is, it started in the manger.
[time=2346] It started in the manger, a beautiful baby.
[time=2350] You've seen a couple pictures of that this morning.
[time=2352] It started in the manger.
[time=2354] He didn't remain the cute little baby.
[time=2357] He was tempted in every way, just like you and I yet was without sin.
[time=2362] Hebrews 4, 15 and 16 says, for we do not have a high priest who was unable to sympathize with our weaknesses.
[time=2370] But one who in every respect was tempted just like you and me, yet was without sin.
[time=2379] And I love this last verse, this verse.
[time=2381] Let us then with confidence, let us then with confidence, draw near to the throne of grace,
[time=2389] that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
[time=2396] You and I both know, in the weeks that we have, there are times of need that you and I have.
[time=2405] And it's because of Jesus' victory in the cross, because of living a perfect life that we can have hope.
[time=2413] We can have confidence to draw near.
[time=2417] Here's the beauty though.
[time=2419] It started in the manger, but the manger is empty.
[time=2423] The manger is empty.
[time=2425] He didn't stay there.
[time=2427] The next bullet, it continued through the cross.
[time=2431] It continued through the cross.
[time=2433] See, because he walked and lived and was tempted in every way, just like you and I,
[time=2439] it equipped him and positioned and postured him to be the perfect sacrifice.
[time=2445] The perfect sacrifice so that he did.
[time=2449] There really was a crucifixion on Friday, on a cross, but he didn't stay there to be really clear.
[time=2459] Mark 1544 even says this.
[time=2461] Some people have said he didn't really die.
[time=2464] Hogwash.
[time=2468] Matthew 5, Mark 1544.
[time=2470] Pilate wondered if he was dead at this time.
[time=2474] And summoning the Satorian.
[time=2476] He questioned him as to whether he was already dead.
[time=2480] And ascertaining this from the Satorian, he granted the body to Joseph of Arimathea.
[time=2488] He wasn't going to give him that body if he wasn't dead.
[time=2492] Jesus really was dead.
[time=2495] Joseph of Arimathea got the body.
[time=2500] So it started in the manger, but it's empty.
[time=2503] It went to the cross, but it's empty.
[time=2508] He's not there.
[time=2510] It continued at the tomb.
[time=2513] It culminated at the tomb.
[time=2516] He really was dead.
[time=2517] Don't be confused.
[time=2519] Remember Pilate and the priest, we already read it, that because they knew that he had said three days later he would be placed in the tomb, they did their best to seal it.
[time=2530] Even after the women ran back to tell Peter and John, they went back themselves to confirm that what?
[time=2540] The tomb was empty.
[time=2543] It started in manger.
[time=2545] He didn't stay there.
[time=2546] It's empty.
[time=2547] It went to the cross.
[time=2549] He didn't stay there.
[time=2550] It's empty.
[time=2551] It went to the tomb.
[time=2552] He was dead.
[time=2554] He raised again on the third day.
[time=2556] The tomb is empty.
[time=2562] Darren's saying this, one day the grave could conceal him no longer.
[time=2566] One day the stone rolled away from the door.
[time=2569] Then he arose over death.
[time=2571] He had conquered.
[time=2573] Now he's ascended my Lord evermore.
[time=2576] Death could not hold him.
[time=2577] The grave could not keep him from rising again.
[time=2581] The tomb is empty.
[time=2584] But guess what?
[time=2586] The other thing that happens is Jesus didn't live to die to rise again to die again.
[time=2596] He did not live to die to rise again to die again.
[time=2601] He is not dead.
[time=2603] He's alive, hallelujah, amen.
[time=2609] The next to last bullet.
[time=2611] It's affirmed.
[time=2612] The gospel is affirmed.
[time=2614] Is him being seen and him being seen and returning to heaven.
[time=2621] In 1 Corinthians 15, 4 through 7.
[time=2624] And what many believe to be some of the earliest creeds.
[time=2628] Some of the earliest creeds that are recited.
[time=2630] But it is detailed that he appeared to Cephas.
[time=2633] Then to the 12.
[time=2634] Then he appeared to more than 500 at one time.
[time=2638] Most of whom are still alive.
[time=2640] Then he appeared to James.
[time=2642] Then to all the apostles.
[time=2644] If you want to read something about Easter, I would suggest to you a book called The Case
[time=2650] for Easter by Lee Strobel.
[time=2652] This one quote right here is worth the whole thing.
[time=2655] Without question, the amount of testimony and corroboration of Jesus post resurrection appearances
[time=2661] is staggering.
[time=2663] To put it into perspective, if you were to call each one of the witnesses to a court of law
[time=2669] to be cross examined for just 15 minutes and you went around the clock without a break.
[time=2674] It would take you from breakfast on Monday until dinner on Friday to hear them all.
[time=2680] After 129 hours of eyewitness testimony, 129 hours of people that saw the risen Savior.
[time=2693] Don't be confused.
[time=2695] He really was raised from the dead.
[time=2700] So from the empty manger to an adult man with a perfect life, living he loved me.
[time=2708] Having a perfect life so he could be a perfect sacrifice through his dying, he saved me from an empty cross.
[time=2717] His death and burial were real.
[time=2719] Buried he carried yours and my sins far away.
[time=2726] With greatest victory ever had by conquering death in Jesus rising from the dead,
[time=2733] with the empty tomb he justified freely forever.
[time=2738] All those who believe in him.
[time=2743] He did not come back to life to die again.
[time=2752] He returned to heaven to sit at the right hand of the Most High and he is coming again glorious day.
[time=2762] This is why we celebrate.
[time=2764] This is why in the midst of the mess of your home, in the midst of the mess of your life, in the midst of the shame and the pain and the difficulty that you have, that you can have hope to cover the pain and difficulties of this life.
[time=2781] And it doesn't depend on my ability to do it myself or yours.
[time=2787] It's fully dependent on him to get it right, because I will screw up.
[time=2796] The very last fill in the blank.
[time=2800] What you believe about Jesus determines your eternity.
[time=2810] John 1 12 says, "Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name,
[time=2819] to those who gave the right to become." There's three words right there.
[time=2826] "Receive, believe, and become." You do not become a child of God.
[time=2831] You do not become a child of the living King Jesus by doing it your own way.
[time=2836] It's only by believing in his sacrifice and an empty manger, an empty cross, and an empty tomb.
[time=2846] It's only way.
[time=2848] What you believe about that severely impacts your eternity.
[time=2853] As Darren and the choir come back up, I want to wrap a couple of things for you here.
[time=2858] John 8 verse 23 and 24 and 25, this hit me just in the last couple weeks.
[time=2867] If you want to flip to it, it's an impactful passage.
[time=2871] Jesus said in John 8, "He says, 'You are in your sin unless you believe who I say that
[time=2881] I am.'" And we already covered that.
[time=2883] He said that he was the Son of God.
[time=2890] Romans 10, 9, and 10 says that if we believe with our heart and confess with our mouth,
[time=2899] we will be saved.
[time=2902] That's the truth.
[time=2904] But it has everything to do with what you do with Jesus' belief.
[time=2910] Your new eternity starts today.
[time=2915] Eternity starts when you believe.
[time=2917] It doesn't start when you die.
[time=2919] There is a term in eternal life that isn't already not yet thing.
[time=2924] There is an already condensed scenario right now.
[time=2928] He does not promise to remove the consequences and circumstances of this life when you trust
[time=2936] even him, that's not what he says.
[time=2940] Rather, that he will bring peace, rest, comfort, healing in the midst of whatever it is.
[time=2949] In the midst of whatever it is, Jesus will do that.
[time=2960] If you live very much life at all, deep down.
[time=2967] I left my drink down there, Jesse.
[time=2970] Thank you.
[time=2977] If you've lived very much life at all, deep down you know much of life.
[time=2989] You can and you can't control deep down inside of you.
[time=2997] You know in your heart of hearts that there are things that you cannot control.
[time=3001] It's called cancer.
[time=3003] It's called death.
[time=3004] It's called sometimes losing your job.
[time=3006] It's called those things.
[time=3008] Are you willing to continue on the path of demonstrated and experienced
[time=3017] inability to control things yourself?
[time=3022] Or are you willing to believe in the only one who has demonstrated that he is trustworthy
[time=3028] and faithful and has power to make your life look different?
[time=3032] It's belief.
[time=3034] It's nothing that you can do.
[time=3037] It's what he's already past tense done.
[time=3045] Let me remind you, he says this.
[time=3047] Come all to me who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest.
[time=3051] Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I'm gentle and humble in heart.
[time=3057] You will receive rest for your souls.
[time=3066] Your faith is only as good as the object in which you place it.
[time=3074] And today I'm telling you there is no better place for you to place a faith and a belief
[time=3080] than in the name at which every knee will bow and every tongue confess under the earth.
[time=3088] And the name is what?
[time=3090] Say it like you mean it?
[time=3093] Jesus.
[time=3095] That is the name.
[time=3097] Every one of us will knee and bow, bow and confess.
[time=3102] What more can he do with the empty tomb?
[time=3105] God's side of the transaction is complete.
[time=3108] Now the Holy Spirit draws our attention to these truths and calls to respond to the empty
[time=3114] manger, the empty cross, and the empty tomb.
[time=3118] The gospel is not the same with any one of them not being empty.
[time=3122] Do you get that?
[time=3125] With any one of them not being empty.
[time=3128] Jesus came as the sovereign suffering servant to do for every one of us what we can't do
[time=3134] for ourselves.
[time=3137] What we can do is respond by surrendering the secrets, the stains, the pain, the shame
[time=3149] of our life to the truth of the gospel.
[time=3152] That's where we're at today.
[time=3154] That's why we're here.
[time=3155] That's why we celebrate the name of Jesus.
[time=3158] That's why we sing the name of Jesus, why we talk about the true and better Adam.
[time=3163] As we sing, I'll be down front.
[time=3166] We have elders.
[time=3168] This isn't about just you that have never done it before, that have never placed your faith and belief in Jesus Christ.
[time=3175] This is about those of you that sit out here today.
[time=3179] In the name of Jesus is something that's only said on Sunday morning.
[time=3186] See you're struggling with how in the world to figure out what to do with your taxes, to get a little more back.
[time=3193] Some of you are dealing with the struggles that you've lost a child.
[time=3199] You've lost a family member.
[time=3202] Just because you believe in the name of Jesus doesn't take all those away.
[time=3207] We would love for you to come down this morning.
[time=3209] We got plenty of elders that will pray with you, respond.
[time=3214] So that looks like, believe in the name of Jesus Christ and you will be saved.
[time=3220] He will make your life look different.
[time=3221] Let me pray.
[time=3223] Father, thank you for this.
[time=3224] Thank you for the privilege.
[time=3225] I just pray right now.
[time=3226] Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit, as Doug sings, I'm amazed that you would move in the hearts
[time=3237] of every one of us, convict us Father, convict us Jesus, convict us Holy Spirit of how much
[time=3245] we need you and that we can't do it on our own.
[time=3248] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3265] No one knew how alone I was feeling.
[time=3273] And the emptiness I tried so hard to hide, though I left instead.
[time=3282] My life was fine without you.
[time=3287] I was covering up the secret tears I cried, then one day someone told me of your mercy
[time=3301] and the love you showed on a hill called Calvary, there you died and purchased my redemption.
[time=3316] When you broke since power and set my spirit free, I'm amazed that you loved me.
[time=3330] I'm amazed how you care, through your precious blood I found hearted.
[time=3345] And my sins are washed, they're all washed away, all my sins are washed away.
[time=3361] Yes, it's true, there have been days when I've filled you, Lord you know the many times
[time=3385] I've gone astray, but I've learned your love is stronger than my weakness and your ear
[time=3397] is open every time I pray, no one else has ever cared for me like you, Lord.
[time=3411] Your friends could never be as close to me, I'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow,
[time=3425] knowing you are everything I'll ever need.
[time=3432] I'm amazed how you care, through your precious blood I found hearted.
[time=3454] And my sins are washed, they're all washed away, all my sins are washed away.
[time=3472] I'm amazed how you care, through your precious blood I found hearted.
[time=3489] And my sins are washed, they're all washed away, all my sins are washed away.
[time=3505] And my sins are washed away, all my sins are washed away, all my sins are washed away.
[time=3562] I'm amazed how you care, through your precious blood I found hearted, all my sins are washed away.
