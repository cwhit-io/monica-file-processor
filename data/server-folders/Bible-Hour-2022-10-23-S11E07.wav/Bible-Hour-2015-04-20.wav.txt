[time=303] Laying yourself down, raising up the rock into love.
[time=321] [APPLAUSE]
[time=325] >> Well, good morning.
[time=327] It's fun to see all those kids just go and know what they're learning, and that's very exciting.
[time=334] We're in the midst of an unashamed message.
[time=337] Today we're talking specifically about witness in the workplace.
[time=343] So the first thing I'd like to say this morning is this.
[time=347] What we traditionally think about the workplace is certainly true, and we'll address that.
[time=352] But I also want you to understand at the same time that there are, you know, plenty of you who are stay-at-home moms who have a workplace that might not be so traditional.
[time=364] And so this applies to you as well.
[time=366] This applies to students when you think about your job of going to school every single day and working hard as unto the Lord through your studies and in your relationships.
[time=376] And so this applies to you as well.
[time=379] It applies to retirees that you might get up and volunteer or you might work with
[time=385] your family or those type of things.
[time=387] It applies to all of us as we would just live in this world specific context, though, that God has provided for us really on a daily basis is what we're talking about this morning, witnessing and bringing the gospel into those contexts that God through His sovereign ways allows us to interact with
[time=409] people who desperately need to know Him.
[time=413] You know, as I was thinking about this, the reality is we all know what we're called to do, right?
[time=419] We could say that about a lot of things in Scripture, but this specifically,
[time=425] we all know what Matthew 5 would say about us, that we are the salt of the
[time=431] earth.
[time=432] And if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty again?
[time=436] We all know that a verse later says that we are the light of the world.
[time=440] If we know Christ, if we are among the committed this morning that have surrendered their life and acknowledged their sinfulness and run to Christ as the only one who can cover their sin and give them life.
[time=455] Those of us who have done that were salt and were light and we know that.
[time=460] And we know what it says in 1 Peter 3, you may not know the exact chapter and verse, but it says in your hearts, honor Christ the Lord, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asked you for the reason, for the hope
[time=476] that is in you.
[time=478] We know what it says in, or the idea behind Colossians chapter 4, verse 6 when it says, "Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt so that you may know
[time=490] how you ought to answer each person." We understand the example of Paul in 1 Corinthians 9 when he says, "I have become all things to all people that I might win some."
[time=505] We know those ideas.
[time=509] And yet for some reason it's just really difficult to allow those truths to play out in my life.
[time=517] I'm assuming in your life as well.
[time=519] And believe me this morning when I say I'm no expert at bringing the gospel into the workplace.
[time=526] But it would be easy for me this morning to have all of us leave this service feeling a little more guilty about all that we're not doing.
[time=537] It'd be easy this morning to have all of us leave feeling a little more clear about how we fall so short.
[time=546] It'd be really easy for us to leave this morning understanding just how bad we are at this.
[time=554] And the reality is that could be every Sunday morning because of our flesh and because of our sinfulness and because of our propensity to follow after our own little idols of our hearts.
[time=565] And again it reminds me of a poem that I've shared with you before.
[time=569] It goes like this, it says, "Run, John, run, the law demands, but gives us neither feet nor hands." You see the truths in Scripture are here and they're a grace from God for us to follow.
[time=585] And yet at the same time their main idea is to point us to Christ, the idea that we cannot keep those commands fully and perfectly and in complete harmony with what God has called us to do.
[time=599] And yet the law is a taskmaster that tells us to keep going, keep performing, you're not doing enough.
[time=606] And it doesn't give us the power to do what it's calling us to do.
[time=612] "Run, John, run, the law demands, but gives us neither feet nor hands."
[time=618] Here's how it ends.
[time=619] Much better news the gospel brings.
[time=623] It bids us fly and it gives us wings.
[time=629] You see the gospel is what God is calling us to in the heights of the gospel
[time=635] and not only is that truth there for us, but that truth is also the power for us to go out and to obey God's commands in the Scriptures for His glory, for our good and for the building of His kingdom.
[time=648] And so my goal this morning is to not have you leave those doors feeling a little bit more guilty or how bad you might be at this.
[time=655] My goal this morning is to show you the wings of God that He offers you in the scriptures.
[time=661] That this morning you will leave this worship service with great hope, that you'll leave this morning out those doors, reminded that God is for you in this endeavor, that you'll leave this morning understanding the infinite resources
[time=681] that you have that are at your disposal as a child of the Most High God,
[time=689] that you'll leave this morning also knowing that God loves you dearly,
[time=696] regardless of how well you witness at work.
[time=701] You see the gospel bids us to fly and it gives us wings.
[time=706] And so this morning I want to show you the wings that God is offering you in the scriptures and we'll look at it in two ways.
[time=713] We're going to look at two reminders from the scriptures and then six practical ideas that you can bring to your workplace, whatever that workplace might look like this morning.
[time=725] Would you pray with me this morning?
[time=727] God, thank you so much for the great news of your gospel.
[time=730] Thank you for your grace and that you give even more grace to us,
[time=736] as Steve talked about a couple weeks ago from James.
[time=740] God, I pray that you would flood our hearts this morning, which is to clear picture of you, a reminder of your grace,
[time=750] a reminder that you're for us and a reminder of the great opportunity and the wonderful call to be a part of your saving people
[time=762] in the same way that you've saved me.
[time=764] Lord, would you use me to save others?
[time=767] God help us this morning.
[time=769] We desperately need you.
[time=771] We can't do this on our own.
[time=773] We're not strong enough.
[time=778] We don't have what we need, but you do.
[time=781] And so we run to you this morning.
[time=783] In Christ's name that we pray, amen.
[time=786] Well, if you have your Bibles turned to Matthew 28, we're going to look at the first reminder and that first reminder is this.
[time=796] It's a reminder to look for God in the great commission.
[time=800] When I say Matthew 28, most of us probably will think of that famous passage, which is the great commission.
[time=807] And probably there's a lot of us in this room that could actually quote what the great commission is.
[time=816] Let me take a step back for a minute and say this about how we look at scripture.
[time=822] We naturally approach the scriptures when we read it, looking to find ourselves.
[time=828] We ask questions like, what does it say about me?
[time=831] Or what am I supposed to do?
[time=833] Or sometimes even in very real ways, what's in it for me?
[time=836] I mean, what are the blessings that I might receive from that?
[time=839] And all of those things are legitimate and good.
[time=842] And yet what if we change this natural approach and first started looking in the scriptures to first find what it says about God.
[time=854] To ask questions when we open up the passage to say this, what does it say about God?
[time=859] What has he done?
[time=860] What has he promised?
[time=862] What is he like?
[time=863] What resources from him are available?
[time=866] And then having understood who he is and what he's done, understand the relationship now that flows out of a knowledge of him to empower us and to fuel us into what it says about us, about what we're called to do about the blessings that we've received.
[time=881] The same thing is true here about Matthew 28.
[time=885] So let's take a minute and look, where do we find ourselves in the Great Commission?
[time=889] It's where most of us go when we think about Matthew 28.
[time=893] It's the command in verse 19.
[time=895] And if you're there, it says this.
[time=898] In verse 19 of Matthew 28, go therefore and make disciples of all nations,
[time=908] baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=914] Wonderful passage.
[time=916] A majestic view of God's vision to reach more and more people into every language group and every tongue and every people a part of this world.
[time=928] And I would say this, that that is exactly what we tend to look at when we look at Matthew 28.
[time=935] And I think that's good.
[time=936] And yet, where do we find God in the Great Commission?
[time=939] I mean, that's us, right?
[time=940] We're supposed to go and make disciples.
[time=945] Where's God in all of that?
[time=947] As we understand the context in reading Matthew 28, there are actually bookends to the command in verse 19.
[time=954] There are two declaratives that I want to show you this morning.
[time=957] They come in verse 18 and then in verse 20.
[time=961] Look at what it says in verse 18.
[time=965] And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
[time=976] Look at verse 20.
[time=979] "Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you always to the end of the age."
[time=991] Do you see that command that we tend to go to in verse 19, which is a wonderful command?
[time=996] And yet on each side of that command are these two wonderful declaratives of Scripture that tell us about who God is and what he's wanting to do and the resources that he has available in our lives.
[time=1009] Look at verse 18 first.
[time=1010] "All authority in heaven and earth has been given to me." His authority.
[time=1015] It's the Greek word exusia.
[time=1017] It's the power to do as he pleases.
[time=1021] You know, the current context of Matthew 28, if we went back, is this, that Jesus has just risen from the dead.
[time=1029] He has announced that he is back, that he has conquered death, and that he has conquered sin and Satan.
[time=1037] He has the power, and he can do as he pleases.
[time=1043] Understand this, that authority is an authority over salvation as well.
[time=1049] It's an authority over his kingdom.
[time=1051] It's an authority not just in the heavens, but as it says there, it's an authority here on earth as he rules and reigns.
[time=1060] And so as you understand this, that again, Steve said this last week, that we don't save anybody.
[time=1067] We can't save anyone, but Jesus has the authority to save anyone
[time=1073] that he pleases to save.
[time=1076] Psalm 3 verse 8 says this, "Salvation belongs to the Lord."
[time=1083] And so when you understand that truth about Jesus having the authority
[time=1089] that he can do as he pleases, specifically regarding salvation and making disciples, what kind of fuel and motivation
[time=1100] and excitement does that give you when you're in your workplace and understanding the command of 19 to make disciples?
[time=1110] That you're not responsible to save anybody.
[time=1114] That he's the one that can do that.
[time=1117] And then verse 20, "And behold, I am with you always to the end of the age."
[time=1124] It's talking about his very presence.
[time=1127] He's with you in your office.
[time=1131] He's with you in your school.
[time=1134] He's with you wherever you are.
[time=1137] You're not alone.
[time=1141] He's right there.
[time=1144] He's right there with you.
[time=1146] How different would our lives be if we lived in the good of God's love for us?
[time=1153] Let alone how different would our witness at work be if we practiced the presence of God as he truly says that he is.
[time=1163] This is a book by Brother Lawrence, written back called "Practicing the Presence of God." That's one you might want to pick up and take a look at.
[time=1173] And so as we look at this idea of looking for God in the great commission, yes, it's true that God calls us to go and to make disciples.
[time=1184] And that can be across the globe, but it's also in our workplaces and it's in our homes and it's at the soccer games and the baseball practices and all those different areas.
[time=1199] But let's not forget what the great commission reminds us about him,
[time=1205] that he has the authority and that he is with us as we share the glory of the gospel.
[time=1216] So the first reminder is to look for God in the great commission.
[time=1220] The book ends of this well-known command of Scripture I think will bolster our confidence in the workplace. The second reminder this morning is this.
[time=1230] The second reminder is to let grace be amazing in your life.
[time=1235] So we look for God in the great commission and secondly we're going to let grace be amazing in our lives.
[time=1243] We're going to look at Romans 9 if you can turn your Bibles there.
[time=1249] The question as you're turning is this, where does a heart for your co-workers come from?
[time=1259] The reality is that we can't drum up the motivation necessary to witness at work.
[time=1266] It's not something that you realize just some day, you know what?
[time=1270] I'm not doing a very good job about bringing the gospel into work and so I just need to do better today. I just need to do better this week.
[time=1277] It's not something that you can consistently just kind of drum up the motivation to go and to witness at work.
[time=1285] Guilt and fear are terrible motivators.
[time=1293] You understand that? That's the law, that's performance-based type of living.
[time=1298] Guilt and fear are terrible motivators. Yes, it may work for a while but it won't last.
[time=1304] And so again, this series and this message is not about making you feel bad or feel like a second-class Christian or feel like you have to change.
[time=1314] The only place where a heart for your co-workers can come from
[time=1321] is a heart full of the grace of God.
[time=1326] That's it. It's out of the overflow of your spiritual health, the overflow of your emotional well-being that comes from your security in what Christ has accomplished for you and what He's promised for you.
[time=1341] Milton Vincent in his little gospel primer says this, "The more I rehearse and exalt in gospel truths, the more there develops in me a corresponding burden for non-Christians to enter into such blessings." What kind of heart are we looking for?
[time=1361] Comes in Romans chapter 9, verse 1 through 3.
[time=1364] He says this, this is Paul, "I'm speaking the truth in Christ," verse 1, "I am not lying, my conscious bears me witness in the Holy Spirit that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart,
[time=1381] for I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, for my kinsmen according to the flesh."
[time=1392] You sense the emotion there, right?
[time=1395] As He's talking about His fellow Israelites who are still blinded by the law and by other things they haven't seen the truth about who Jesus is and the emotion that is in His heart for His own life to be cut off from the grace of God in order that they might come to know Him.
[time=1415] That's the heart that I would like.
[time=1418] That's the heart we would want for all of you as well.
[time=1423] But where did that heart of Romans 9, 1 through 3 come from?
[time=1429] Well, we don't have time this morning, but I'm going to take a quick overview.
[time=1433] That heart from Romans chapter 9 comes from the glorious truths
[time=1439] of the gospel that Paul has just rehearsed in Romans chapter 1 through Romans chapter 8.
[time=1447] Let's take a quick walk through the depths of truth found in those previous chapters to see the source of Paul's heart for his fellow kinsmen.
[time=1455] In chapter 1 verse 18 it says this, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and the unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth." So he starts out in Romans 1 just talking about how there is this wrath of God that every human being will experience apart from Christ.
[time=1477] And then in chapter 2 verses 5 through 8 he says this, "But because of your heart and impetentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself.
[time=1485] On the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed, he will render to each one according to his works.
[time=1493] To those who by patience and well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.
[time=1499] But for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness there will be wrath and fury." You see he goes to the bad news first, right?
[time=1512] That the wrath of God is being revealed.
[time=1516] And he talks about how every person is accountable to God and every person has gone their own way.
[time=1523] In Romans chapter 3 verse 10 he says this, "There is none righteous, no not one.
[time=1530] No one understands.
[time=1532] No one seeks God." And then he says for those who are really trying to obey, he says for by the works of the law in chapter 3 verse 20, no one will be justified.
[time=1545] But then this flip in Romans 3 21, but now there's a righteousness of God that's been manifested apart from the law.
[time=1553] It's the righteousness of God that comes through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe.
[time=1559] And then he goes on this beautiful tear from chapter 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 about the glories of the gospel in his life to save him and also in his life to sanctify him.
[time=1570] But in chapter 5 he says this, "Therefore since we've been justified by faith, we now have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[time=1581] Chapter 5 verse 8, "But God shows his love toward us that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." Chapter 6, "We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin." All of this is the reality of a Christian.
[time=1605] Things that are true because of what Christ has accomplished.
[time=1610] And then in Romans 8 he says, "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[time=1618] For the law of the Spirit of life has set us free." Chapter 8, 16.
[time=1624] Again, just Paul rehearsing these gospel truths.
[time=1628] The Spirit bears witness with our spirits that we are children of God.
[time=1633] I mean it just keeps getting better and better the realities of this grace of God that none of us deserve, that Paul didn't deserve, and yet his heart is getting more and more full as he rehearses these truths.
[time=1646] And then in 837 through 39 he says this, "In all these things were more than conquerors through him who loved us.
[time=1653] For I am sure that neither death nor life, neither angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation.
[time=1665] There is nothing that will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord." And then 9 verse 1 through 3.
[time=1677] He has this heart that his fellow kinsmen would experience the same realities that he's just rehearsed over those 8 chapters.
[time=1690] These are not just words for Paul, it's his life.
[time=1694] If we had time to go to Philippians chapter 3 and he would talk about how he was among those who were trying to keep the law, he was the front-runner, and yet he counts all of that as rubbish compared to knowing Christ.
[time=1710] It's Paul's life.
[time=1713] It's my life.
[time=1715] It's your life, if you know Christ this morning, that you've been saved from the wrath and the fury and the unrighteousness that the righteous wrath of God that we all deserve and we've been given blessing upon blessing upon blessing, this grace is amazing.
[time=1738] And yet it just becomes familiar, right?
[time=1745] It just becomes familiar.
[time=1750] It just becomes old hat.
[time=1752] Certainly are grateful for what it did in the past, and yet it's just somehow just week after week or year after year.
[time=1759] It just kind of loses its luster.
[time=1763] And so what I'm saying this morning is this, that we need to let grace be amazing again in our lives and let those truths of the gospel fill our hearts in such a way that we just can't help but share it.
[time=1782] Milton Vincent again said this, "If I wish to have a Romans 9 kind of burden for non-Christians, I should become practiced at celebrating the gospel as Paul does in Romans 1 through 8." So the first reminder this morning from Scripture is to look for God in the Great Commission, the bookends of this well-known command, to bolster our confidence in the workplace.
[time=1806] He has authority, he's always going to be with us.
[time=1809] The second reminder is to let grace be amazing.
[time=1813] We know that it is, but let it be amazing so it cultivates and grows our hearts for those who need to know Jesus.
[time=1825] Quickly six, just practical ideas that hopefully will equip you
[time=1831] to bring the gospel into your work context, whatever it is.
[time=1835] The first one is this, we need to know the gospel first, right?
[time=1842] I mean, we need to have a familiarity with it in a way that that doesn't again lose its luster, but a familiarity that we can talk about it whenever that it would in a sense be the most precious thing in our lives
[time=1860] is the person in work of Christ, that we would understand how to communicate it, that we would understand how it functions in our lives, that we would know the gospel, that we'd be able as Mark flaggy did this morning for those that came to first hour, described different ways to be able to communicate the gospel to others, to become an expert in the gospel, to know it.
[time=1882] The second thing that I would say this morning is this, when you look at those who haven't surrendered to Christ in your workplace, expect them to be sinners and don't judge.
[time=1895] You know, sometimes we get taken back by either talk or actions
[time=1904] or ideas that they bring to the table when the reality is, we should expect that from those who don't know Christ.
[time=1918] And our first idea is to somehow bring judgment into that place.
[time=1923] I think that just kind of makes us feel better about ourselves sometimes, right?
[time=1928] I mean, that's just real, that's just pride in that sense.
[time=1933] And so the humility to understand that I don't sit in the judgment seat and then I can expect them to live a life that is outside of what God calls us to do
[time=1944] and to love them in the midst of that, to not be taken back by it,
[time=1950] but to step into it and love them for who they are
[time=1956] as a human being made in the image of God.
[time=1960] Expect them to sin and don't judge.
[time=1962] Third practical idea, be an excellent employee.
[time=1968] Be an excellent mom, be an excellent student.
[time=1972] Colossians 3, 23, again, whatever you do, work heartily as for the Lord and not for men.
[time=1978] Philippians 2, do all things without grumbling or disputing.
[time=1984] Part of being an excellent worker is to bring a great attitude to your work, right?
[time=1989] To not grumble, to not dispute what it goes on, that you may be blameless and innocent children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation among whom you shine as light in the world.
[time=2002] Be an excellent employee.
[time=2004] Part of being an excellent employee as well is knowing the legalities of sharing your faith.
[time=2010] Certainly not an attorney, nor am I giving legal advice, but there are some things that you can do some research on.
[time=2018] The Christian Law Association said this, Title VII, Civil Rights Act of 1964, stipulates that a company that allows employees to engage in non-work-related conversations, such as those things about politics, family, sports, or other topics, they may not prohibit voluntary religious discussions between employees either.
[time=2041] So as long as they allow discussion about anything else, then you have every right to talk about your religion.
[time=2050] Now, don't do it on work time, but at break time, before you check in, after you check in, you've got the legal freedom to be able to talk about your faith.
[time=2068] Limits on this, it says, are two.
[time=2071] An employee must not allow religious discussions to interfere with work.
[time=2076] At that point, the employer has every opportunity to say, "You know what?
[time=2081] You're not going to be here any longer." Be an excellent employee. The second is this.
[time=2085] If a coworker indicates either directly or indirectly that she does not wish to discuss or he does not wish to discuss matters of religion, the Christian employee should immediately stop discussing it with them.
[time=2098] Those two caveats.
[time=2100] And again, I'm not an attorney, but look that type of stuff up.
[time=2104] Part of being an excellent employee is to know the parameters in your office and honor those you work for by knowing those things.
[time=2114] Fourth, practical idea. Pray. Pray.
[time=2120] Pray for opportunities. Pray for those people in your work.
[time=2125] And sometimes if you have opportunity, ask.
[time=2128] Ask if you can pray with them.
[time=2131] If they're sharing something that's important on their heart, I do this all the time. Do you mind if I say a quick prayer for you?
[time=2140] Most people say, "You know what? That'd be great." Whether they know God or not, they appreciate that prayer.
[time=2149] Closhing's four or three, Paul says, "At the same time, pray for us that God may open to us a door for the Word to declare the mystery of Christ." Pray, pray, pray.
[time=2160] Five, learn to put Jesus on the table.
[time=2166] Just get him out in the open.
[time=2168] Again, we know there's no other name under heaven by which men can be saved.
[time=2172] It's not just talking about God. If you talk about God, they have their own understanding of who God is.
[time=2179] But Jesus, Jesus Christ, get him on the table.
[time=2184] Be ready for common themes that just come up.
[time=2187] You know, everyone talks about the struggle in their lives.
[time=2191] And for you to be able to relate that to the greatest struggle ever of Jesus at the cross and the peace and rest that can come from that struggle. Amazing.
[time=2202] Losing a loved one, there are times when you don't know what to say.
[time=2206] And yet to be able to come back and say, "You know what?
[time=2209] I don't know how you feel, but I know that God knows how you feel because He lost His Son at Calvary, and I know He can relate to you."
[time=2218] Be ready for just some common themes to put Jesus on the table.
[time=2223] Maybe have a weekly Bible reading time before you start
[time=2229] or at your lunch break. You don't have to have a Bible study.
[time=2233] You don't have to be a student of the word necessarily, although there's nothing wrong with having a Bible study.
[time=2238] But have it just be a time where you say, "Hey, we're getting together and we're reading through the Bible together. Join us." Put Jesus on the table.
[time=2248] What do you say when they say, "Hey, what did you do this weekend?" How many of us are just not taking advantage of that to say, "I say it all the time." You know what?
[time=2258] I didn't do much this weekend.
[time=2261] I said, "You know what? I went to church this weekend and had a great time. You don't have to go much further than that." But to take advantage of the idea of being able to put Jesus on the table, be ready to share your story, have your own testimony written out and ready to go, be open about your family, be ready to share what you're learning or reading.
[time=2285] I mean, those are just ways to put Jesus on the table.
[time=2288] And finally, the sixth is this, build a genuine relationship.
[time=2295] Show a genuine concern for those people in your workplace.
[time=2299] You might have a propensity or affinity towards certain people, and that's fine.
[time=2304] And God may, you know, use that to reach those people, but have a concern for all of them. Be quick to help.
[time=2312] Be interested in their kids. Be excited about their joys.
[time=2317] Even though sometimes you look at them and you think, "Oh, it just must be so empty." Still, somehow be excited about what they're excited about.
[time=2328] Part of building this relationship could be throwing what's called a Matthew party.
[time=2333] Interesting. In Mark chapter 2, Jesus called Levi to follow him, and in that same context, Levi then threw a dinner for Jesus where he invited some who knew Jesus,
[time=2347] and he also invited some of his old buddies who didn't know Jesus, and they're there, and they had dinner together.
[time=2357] Come into your home and have some other Christians there.
[time=2364] Lots of different ways that we can try to be creative in thinking through bringing the gospel into our workplace.
[time=2373] I'm not very good at it.
[time=2378] There are days when I feel guilty about it, and yet I know that God is for me in it, that regardless of my performance of how well I witness at work or how well I don't witness well at work, that God's love for me is secure, and I can rest in that.
[time=2399] And as I rest in that more and more, that will then give me the motivation and the joy to go and to look for him in the Great Commission to let grace be amazing and incorporate some of these things that we've learned together.
[time=2416] God, thanks so much this morning for, again, how you are patient with us, how you're for us.
[time=2423] Thank you for the beautiful declaratives of Scripture that call us to know who you are, to rest in what you've accomplished, to take great joy in your promises and in your presence so that we can live in this world in the power of your gospel, the power of your spirit, and so, God, we pray that we would be a people that would have a bold witness at work because of your bold work on our behalf, to die on a cross, to come back to life, to have a future for us in your kingdom.
[time=2464] My name is Sarah Davis, and this is my story.
[time=2471] I left God behind in high school and tried to find where I belonged and started dating a boy who was abusive and controlling.
[time=2485] When I was 17, I found out that I was pregnant and before I could really process the enormity of the situation, I was being convinced by my boyfriend's mother to go out of state and have a secret abortion.
[time=2509] Satan convinced me really quickly that my parents wouldn't love me and that I would never be a good mother.
[time=2521] I believed the lies and with the convincing of this abusive family, I allowed for my abortion to be scheduled.
[time=2532] If hell on earth exists, an abortion is hell on earth.
[time=2538] The day was horrible torture.
[time=2541] I was verbally abused by my boyfriend and the staff at the clinic treated me and every other underage girl there, like cattle.
[time=2554] They didn't acknowledge your name and why would they?
[time=2562] I look back on it now and see that in the midst of my disobedience and the trouble, I'd put myself in.
[time=2571] God used a nurse there.
[time=2574] Maybe she was an angel who called me by my name.
[time=2583] And came to me when I thought I was dying in the bathroom of an abortion clinic in Chicago
[time=2594] with no one around me who loved me.
[time=2600] I went home and I didn't tell anybody about my abortion, not my parents or my siblings.
[time=2611] I opened up to my parents a couple years later
[time=2617] and that's when the healing in our relationship began when I spoke the truth about my experience.
[time=2626] At 19, I was in a serious relationship, unmarried and found myself pregnant.
[time=2633] Again, my first thought was I'm going to have to have another abortion.
[time=2640] My God intervened and led me to tell my mom that I was pregnant.
[time=2647] And I have my 11-year-old son today because of God.
[time=2657] After my field relationship with my son's father,
[time=2663] I met my husband, Ryan, and we had our daughter, Marnie.
[time=2671] And I struggled with anger and depression after I had her.
[time=2678] I was confused because I had a perfect family.
[time=2684] I had a loving husband and I didn't know why I would feel this way.
[time=2692] I went to the doctor who delivered Marnie and he prayed with me in his office.
[time=2700] I accepted Christ into my heart that day.
[time=2703] A lot of people think that once you accept Jesus into your heart, you know, your life's going to be perfect.
[time=2715] I'm a brand new Christian, but I quickly learned that that wasn't going to happen for me.
[time=2724] We moved to Fort Wayne.
[time=2726] I had our son, Jack, and it was the worst year of our lives.
[time=2734] I struggled with anger, suicidal thoughts and depression.
[time=2739] So dark that I begged God to take my life
[time=2745] to spare my family the pain that I was causing them.
[time=2751] I came across a book about women who had healing from abortion
[time=2758] and their stories were very similar to mine.
[time=2762] I decided that I needed to reach out.
[time=2767] I wound up at a Hope Center in a Bible study for post-board of women and the study was called "Forgiven and Set Free." Walking into this study, I was a murderer, and with all the hate in my heart for my abusers, my boyfriend and his parents, I would have killed them given the chance.
[time=2792] This made me a multiple murderer.
[time=2795] My deep hate for these people was spilling over into my life and affecting my family's life.
[time=2804] While I was working through this study, we came to the forgiveness part.
[time=2809] I sat down one Saturday and I was really ready to dig in.
[time=2818] At this point, I knew that Jesus lived inside of me but I didn't know his potential.
[time=2827] As I was reading God's Word and letting God work in my heart,
[time=2833] it was a fast, as lightning miracle.
[time=2839] I can picture it like being lost in the dark, a blindingly dark prison, that I had made my home that I had hated
[time=2853] and the light just burst through and the light just blinded me.
[time=2864] You know that the light is real and right, and God reached into my heart and he took out all of the negative and hateful and sinful and murderous
[time=2885] feelings that were there and replaced them with a love that can only come from him.
[time=2898] I think that day I fell in love with God and if you know what falling in love with God is like,
[time=2909] it's a romance you walk around all day, thinking of no one else, and that's what I did.
[time=2919] I can only imagine that that is just a taste of what he feels for me.
[time=2927] For me, in spite of all that I had done, I can say that on that day I was free and I was out of prison.
[time=2941] Just as I am without one need,
[time=2951] God that I loved was shed for me,
[time=2960] and that God convinced me,
[time=2966] come to thee, oh well,
[time=2972] of God I come, I come,
[time=2983] yes, as I am, and wait enough to bring my soul of one dark light to be lose blood and let's each God oh well, of God I come, I come,
[time=3025] I come broken to be mended, I come wounded to be him, I come desperate to be rescued, I love empty to be filled, I come guilty to be parted, I love blood of Christ alone, and I'm welcome with open arms, praise God, just as I am.
[time=3073] Just as I am, I will be lost, but bursting in grace, my freedom brought, and now to glory,
[time=3097] with your pride to learn,
[time=3103] of God I come, I come, I come broken to be mended,
[time=3119] I come wounded to be him, I come desperate to be rescued, I come empty to be filled, I come guilty to be parted, I love blood of Christ alone, and I'm welcome with open arms, praise God, just as I am.
[time=3156] I come broken to be mended, I come wounded to be him, I come desperate to be rescued, I come desperate to be filled, I come guilty to be parted, I love blood of Christ alone, and I'm welcome with open arms, praise God, just as I am.
[time=3198] Praise God, just as I am.
[time=3219] [MUSIC]
[time=3232] I'm going to read truth to you this morning as we close.
[time=3237] It's from Milton Vincent's Gospel Primer, some of you are familiar with.
[time=3242] It's simply the good news of the Gospel.
[time=3246] Take a minute and just listen, take it in, and when I'm done reading, Darren and the group will play some music, and you're welcome to leave this morning.
[time=3262] My God is immense beyond imagination.
[time=3265] He measured the entire universe with merely the span of his hand.
[time=3269] He's unimaginably awesome in all of his perfections, absolutely righteous, holy, and just in all of his ways.
[time=3276] He's also been unbelievably good and merciful to me as the creator and sustainer of my life.
[time=3281] Every breath, every heartbeat, every function of every organ in my body is a gift from him.
[time=3288] Every legitimate pleasure I experience is a gift from his loving hand to me.
[time=3293] All that I am and all that I have, I owe to him, and to his goodness.
[time=3299] Life in every way is and will continue to be utterly dependent upon him in whom I live and move and have my being.
[time=3306] This wonderful God is the most supremely worthy object of admiration, honor, and delight in all of the universe.
[time=3314] And he's created me with the intention that I might glorify him by finding my soul's delight in him and by living in joyful obedience to him in all of my ways.
[time=3325] Yet, I could not have failed this great God more miserably than I have.
[time=3331] Instead of giving thanks to him and humbly submitting to his rule over my life, I've rebelled against him and have actually sought to exalt myself above him.
[time=3341] Going my own way and living according to my own wisdom, I've broken countless times, either the letter or spirit of every one of God's ten commandments.
[time=3350] Thinking myself to be wise, I've shown myself to be a fool and because of my arrogance, God has every right to damn me to the everlasting experience of his terrifying wrath in the lake of fire.
[time=3363] So as for myself, apart from Christ, I am bound by the guilt of my sins
[time=3369] and also bound by the power of sin, sin, enslaved to various lusts and pleasure.
[time=3375] Apart from Christ, I am also utterly deserving of and destined for eternal punishment in the lake of fire, completely unable to save myself or even to make one iota of a contribution to my own salvation.
[time=3390] However, what I could not do God did.
[time=3395] And in doing it, he did it all, sending his own son into the world to die on the cross from my sins, thereby showing me unfathomable love.
[time=3405] God loved me so much that he was willing to suffer the loss of his son, even more amazingly, he was willing to allow his son to suffer the loss of him at the cross.
[time=3415] Jesus loved me so much that he was willing to lay down his life for me.
[time=3419] No one could ever love me more or better than Jesus.
[time=3424] God then exalted Christ to his own right hand, where Christ now reigns from on high, granting salvation and forgiveness to all who call on him by faith.
[time=3434] Now when my time came and I placed my faith in Jesus, God instantly granted me a great salvation.
[time=3441] He forgave all of my sins past, present, and future.
[time=3445] He made me his child adopting me into his family.
[time=3448] He gave me the gift of the Holy Spirit who gives me God's power, who pours out God's love within my heart, and who tenderly communicates to my spirit that I am a child of God and an heir of eternal glory in heaven.
[time=3463] In saving me, God also freed me from slavery to any and all sins.
[time=3468] I no longer have to sin again for sins mastery over me has been broken.
[time=3472] In saving me, God also justified me.
[time=3475] And being justified through Christ, I have peace with God that will endure forever.
[time=3481] In justifying me, God declared me innocent of my sins and pronounced me righteous with the very righteousness of Jesus.
[time=3489] God also allowed his future and present wrath against me to be completely propitiated by Jesus, who bore it upon himself on the cross.
[time=3499] Consequently, God now has only love, compassion, and deepest affection for me.
[time=3505] And this love is without any admixture of wrath whatsoever.
[time=3510] God always looks upon me and treats me with gracious favor, always working all things together for my ultimate and eternal good.
[time=3520] I don't deserve any of this, even on my best day.
[time=3527] But this is my salvation, and here in I stand.
[time=3534] Thank you, Jesus.
