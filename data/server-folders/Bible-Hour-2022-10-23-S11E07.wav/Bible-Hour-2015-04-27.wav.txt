[time=355] up, lift you up, lift you up, lift you up, lift you up, lift you up, lift you up, lift
[time=431] up, it's hard to believe that knowing those things that we just sang, it's even difficult
[time=440] for us to talk about it, it really is, I'm going to hear now from some missionaries
[time=449] on this video and he's worthy to be praised all over the world and we want to listen
[time=457] to that today so listen.
[time=461] One of the biggest things I've learned is that it's not up to us to make people become
[time=468] Christians.
[time=471] What I mean by that is it is our responsibility to be sharing the truth with people who don't know it and friends and family nearby or co-workers but the reality is that we can do all that
[time=484] we want and we can convince people all we want but until God really changes people's hearts that's when they'll come to know the Lord.
[time=491] If I ever come back home, I think one thing I would do is, like I said earlier, that
[time=508] I would be trying to take more public transportation or putting myself specifically in places where
[time=515] I have more opportunities to meet people that wouldn't know the Lord that I could share the gospel with and not be, I don't mean this in a bad way, not be so involved just in
[time=526] the church but be involved in the community around me and use the church as my base and root for where I'm growing and in fellowship with people but to spend a lot of my time out and sharing the gospel.
[time=536] I don't know that much would change except for maybe what I've already said is that there's
[time=542] a deep need to know and to love people well and to really sow to a relationship.
[time=551] More often than not, it's not really convincing somebody that Jesus is real or that we really do have to surrender to Him but really what convinces people is love.
[time=560] When they see the gospel love of God displayed in our lives to them, that's when people
[time=568] understand and are experiencing the love of the gospel and it selfens their heart to
[time=575] be more ready to receive this truth to receive and surrender their life to Jesus.
[time=585] I wish that I would have known some really simple ways to communicate the gospel before
[time=598] I moved to Poland.
[time=600] The language here is such a huge challenge for any adult to learn a new language is a huge
[time=607] challenge and in America I used to know lots of theological terms and all these great Bible
[time=615] verses that I had memorized and I would communicate the gospel with people through a very intellectual
[time=621] argument.
[time=622] But here I only have a few words that I know how to say and so I'm really really handicapped
[time=630] when it comes to sharing the gospel.
[time=631] I think that something that I wish I would have been more prepared for is just the idea of that I can't do anything, like I can't save someone, I can't make them respond to
[time=643] the gospel in that I can't be in charge of my fruitfulness but I can be in charge of
[time=654] my faithfulness.
[time=656] I definitely wish I would have been more prepared in knowing scripture.
[time=663] There's been times where I visit people's homes and I'm wanting to share the gospel with them and I just don't have the best way of sharing the gospel from Genesis all the way to Revelation in a way that might make sense to them.
[time=675] I can share my story and what Jesus means to me but I wish I could back that up with more scripture and there's always times when I encourage people where they're at and praying
[time=686] for them and I don't know exactly where a certain verse comes from or where a specific
[time=692] truth can be found in scripture and if I would have memorized more scripture and know more references I'd be able to point people to the scripture and showing them exactly where
[time=703] it can be found and then they can continue on reading from there but definitely wish
[time=709] I would have been more prepared biblically.
[time=713] There's anything I've learned that's really helped me in being able to convey the gospel to people is to simply just be a better question-asker, a question-asker of really getting to know
[time=723] the person where they're at.
[time=727] Everybody or almost everybody is living in immense poverty on less than $2 a day and
[time=742] so day after day these people are in survival mode.
[time=746] They don't know when their next meal is coming, they don't know if they're gonna have a job tomorrow, they don't know how they're gonna get money, how they're gonna get food and so their lives are just survival mode all the time.
[time=762] With that comes less distractions and so the Christians that I've met here are on fire
[time=768] for the Lord and I see them praising and worshiping Jesus with their hands lifted high and it's
[time=774] amazing because I see them doing that and I know that they're gonna go home after church and they probably won't be eating anything and they won't be able to provide anything
[time=783] to eat for their children, they might not have enough soap to wash their children's uniforms
[time=789] to go to school the next day and so in that sense these hopeless people are looking for
[time=796] something that they can put their hope in and so when they do they are full fledged all
[time=802] the way.
[time=803] One thing that's similar about serving in Poland, Tanya and I were just talking about this, people are people no matter where you go and the more we get to know Polish people we see that the teenagers we serve they just want to be loved like teenagers in America they just want to be encouraged and accepted just like teenagers in America and they want
[time=824] to be respected, they want to be respected in their beliefs even if they're different than ours and they want to be respected in their process if they're in one to change those beliefs.
[time=836] I found that people are more open and more needy at the Gospel than we think.
[time=844] My friends Caleb and Blair Mitchell will come on up.
[time=848] We get to hear some really sweet things from people that are not physically in this building every week and we're also going to take right now a few minutes to hear from Caleb and Blair.
[time=861] Caleb and Blair are a couple that have been at Blackhawk for a long time now, 2002 and
[time=872] so the one thing that I just want to celebrate today, it was just three weeks short of one
[time=880] year ago that Caleb on May 28th was emergency flight at home on a medical flight because
[time=888] of his health condition and not really sure whether God was going to see him through what that looked like left Caleb, Blair and three children in the middle of Uganda and
[time=899] I just want to acknowledge today that Caleb's a healthy guy.
[time=903] He really is doing well and that we can praise God because of his provision for them even as they're back here.
[time=912] One of the things that's important for us to remember is that we all think about vocational
[time=920] missionaries and pastors and all these kinds of things and I want to just help you and Caleb and Blair want to help you this morning understand that they were here in 2002 and
[time=933] were working through some things and God called them to Africa and they went through and they worked through some things in Africa and God saw fit a year ago to send them back to the
[time=944] United States and really clear direction of transplant back to here and so we're really
[time=951] thankful for that.
[time=952] One of the questions that we just want to talk about a little bit and have them share with you this morning are what are some of the major differences that you experienced from there here going to there or they're coming back to here that you guys just want to share this morning.
[time=965] I wanted to say real quick though the similarities and I think you're probably going to touch on this.
[time=970] The gospel is the same the message is the same and the people are the same if you're lost you're lost and the thing that brings me most comfort is God's the one that draws the heart
[time=981] I think you kind of got that from the messages from the other missionaries and John 6 says that all those the Father has given me will come to me and that should take all pressure
[time=992] off when you when you're dealing with the gospel because that's God's department he
[time=998] just is using us as messengers of the gospel he's the one that opens the eyes heals the sick opens the ears for people to hear the message.
[time=1010] I think the big difference for me first it's hard for me to share my faith here in America I'll just tell you that right off the bat I'm scared to death to do it here a missionary yeah he still gets a paycheck from a missionary he's a supported guy and you hear him it's still difficult to share the gospel here in America and Uganda was very easy and it comes
[time=1029] back to fear I think for me fear of man versus fear of God there's I think it passes in Luke 12 it talks about Christ saying fear don't fear the one who can kill kill the body that
[time=1040] we man feel fear the one that can kill both body and throw soul your soul into hell that's who you're supposed to fear.
[time=1046] And so I fear man and so it's hard for me to do it here because of the of the pushback
[time=1052] and Uganda the culture is such a dialoguing culture yeah so I love to share the gospel
[time=1058] because everywhere I went I would have a dialogue and there wasn't a pushback there wasn't a resistance doesn't mean that people would agree with you but they were willing to dialogue the Muslim on the street was willing to dialogue with me about who Jesus was and I was asking who do you say Jesus was that's always the point of conversation because that's really the point of conversation in any in evangelistic effort and so it was easy to
[time=1080] do it here there it's hard to do it here because of fear and the resistance we bought you a layer.
[time=1089] As Caleb said people are the same and the children that we worked with in Uganda needed Jesus just as much as the kids here I was telling Rick when we were discussing a little
[time=1102] bit last week what we were going to talk about that I'd walked into a situation where I saw
[time=1108] some photos on the wall actually there were paintings on the wall and there were paintings
[time=1114] of children in some Eastern European country and they looked like they were following the
[time=1120] artist with joy faces round happy faces that looked like they were just trying to catch
[time=1126] up with this this artist whoever was depicting this this painting and then contrasted right
[time=1132] next to it were pictures of African children and one in particular and the lighting really
[time=1139] honed in on and the face was drawn and narrow and sad sunken eyes and I looked at that and
[time=1146] I thought if the eyes are the window to the soul then every last person has eyes just
[time=1152] like that African child and I think that that's something that I need to continually be reminded
[time=1158] of here that the cute little kids down the street that my kids are playing with that don't
[time=1164] know Jesus and their parents their eyes hold that same emptiness and the same just need
[time=1172] for love so the need is the same they don't necessarily need my love they need the love
[time=1178] of Jesus shown through my hands and feet yeah that's really good whether they're in your
[time=1184] community whether they're in your neighborhood or your cul-de-sac the eyes of the window to the soul question regarding one of the things Caleb and I've talked about for years is is the truth in the lies that the enemy uses and what it looks like what were some
[time=1200] of the lies that the enemy tried to get you to embrace yeah I think I don't know if this
[time=1208] is going to come out but God going to Uganda I'm coming back it's what did what did I teach
[time=1215] Uganda and now they realize that Uganda or Africa has taught me a lot more than what
[time=1221] I thought I was going to teach Africa really it was God who was teaching me not not African
[time=1228] necessarily and the idea that I am needed God didn't create me to fulfill a need of his
[time=1241] I'm not the answer to the world's problems Christ is so he didn't create me to solve
[time=1249] the world's problems he sent his son Jesus to die on the cross I think that was a big learning curve for me going into Africa and then I got sick and then I had so many issues and the believers that were taking care of me it just was just was so different than what I imagined and another another thing to do is God's sovereignty God's sovereignty yeah
[time=1269] and all of life yeah whether you're rich whether you're poor whether you're sick whether you're
[time=1275] healthy 1 Samuel 2 talks about this Hannah's prayer God makes the rich God makes the poor
[time=1281] God brings life God brings death he's sovereign all over all of that and that's a big reality in Uganda and to understand that he is sovereign in all of this brings me to the most more
[time=1292] comfort than anything and when we preach the gospel it's the same thing he's sovereign in all of that and in life circumstances so I've learned a lot about that being there Aliyah one of the lies that you thought about yeah a lie that I think I've battled from the beginning of going to Uganda and even returning it's interesting how we think some
[time=1312] of those lies have been defeated by truth and they creep right back in but I remember leaving on furlough our first furlough maybe two and a half years into being there and thinking oh no who's gonna love these kids the way I loved them who's gonna take care
[time=1328] of them when they fall down and they need a band-aid and they're here by my house and
[time=1335] then when we left similarly we were involved with a foster type family where we gave aid
[time=1342] to parents who who raised kids and some of those older kids were growing up and moving
[time=1348] out of the house and moving on to school and at the time we were leaving the family
[time=1354] parents there was a change in family parents and so new people came in and old left and
[time=1362] older kids that were moving away then didn't have a tie back to this family and I really believe that's what God was gonna use us to be the grandparents that chased after and
[time=1373] made sure and watched them have kids and loved on them you know and walked through life with them and for him to remove us from that I felt like oh no God who's gonna who's gonna
[time=1384] look after these kids that are now growing up and are moving away and who's gonna keep track of them and who's gonna love on them and the truth of the matter is he is we just
[time=1394] saw that video of all those things that he is he's the protector he's the provider he's
[time=1400] the lover of their souls not me yes does he use me yes and it's a privilege to be used
[time=1407] but he's the one that cares for the lost and cares for the widow and the orphan so that's a lie that even now I am thankful for the reminder of truth but that I deal with yeah
[time=1420] let them go down is Caleb one of the things that Caleb said is the truth he already alluded to it was one of the last things the truth is is even as we went even as people that I've
[time=1432] led on teams before you go thinking that you're going to give and the truth is is that as
[time=1438] you go you're taught way more than you ever teach you learn more than you ever convey
[time=1446] and that's the truth of true service is that you're offering something that looks that way
[time=1452] let's give them the thanks guys it's a sweet thing it's a sweet thing and a privilege that
[time=1463] we get number one to have I don't know maybe flagies your archers could help I think the numbers like 40 some over here on our wall of people that go it's a really good thing
[time=1474] for us to go and what it looks like but it's a really healthy reminder for us to also understand
[time=1480] the significance the significance of those that go are normal people they're normal people
[time=1490] they're like you and me we're really thankful that you're here today and and whether or
[time=1497] not you're physically in our service or whether you're watching on the live stream or the Bible hour we'll really thank you for making a priority today for years around here we've
[time=1508] rallied around there's three things that we gather in this room we gather in this room
[time=1514] to encounter God and then we connect we connect in smaller groups connect in smaller settings
[time=1522] to engage in growth for us to not be the same people that we used to be that we grow and
[time=1528] move on the third component is that we go we go we serve and participate as God he expands
[time=1539] his reach and that's what we're talking about today to what we're talking about all over the place with St. Louis and Poland and all these places is that we're called to go in
[time=1548] recent weeks we've really talked about our being unashamed and Romans 1 16 for we believe
[time=1554] and I'm not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God that brings salvation
[time=1560] to everyone who believes we're not ashamed that's the whole reason that we're talking
[time=1566] about this it really really does matter Steve Webster a couple weeks ago shared with us
[time=1574] about the concepts of shame and fear and lack of confidence as you share the gospel and what
[time=1581] does that look like last week Josh Rang shared with us this thought that the last thing last thing
[time=1588] the last thing we want you to do is leave this place thinking that you're just a worst failure
[time=1595] in the gospel and sharing the gospel and what you are that's the last thing we want to happen
[time=1601] we want you to walk out of here empowered and encouraged to engage the kingdom for God's purpose I love the way that that Josh said it last week when we look for God in the great commission
[time=1615] and let God's grace be amazing in our lives the good news of the gospel transforms the
[time=1623] relationships that we have the gospel changes the way that you look at the people that you talk to
[time=1629] the way that you interact with them but it happens because of the grace of God being amazing in your life and mind it really does matter Francis Chan in his book Crazy Love the relentless overwhelmed by a relentless God he says this
[time=1646] do you know I really want you to dwell on this do you know that nothing you do in this life
[time=1655] and will never matter unless it is about loving God and loving the people he's made
[time=1662] you just heard a layer say it it's not just the little African kid with these cheeks sunken in
[time=1668] it's not just the girl that's trafficked it's the kids that are on your cul-de-sac it's the kids that you're coaching and baseball and cub football it's the things that you're doing in that way those are just the same people it's not just that place nothing in this life matters
[time=1685] unless you're loving God and the people he's created on Easter we saw a powerful video we saw a powerful video about the fact that this book
[time=1697] this book is just not a series of disconnected stories it's not but a beautiful beautifully
[time=1706] designed flawless tapestry of God's heart of grace from creation to the cross
[time=1713] from creation to the cross it's intricate in its detail of God's desire and plan for bringing
[time=1721] those who are sinful and far from him into an intimate relationship with him with Jesus
[time=1727] and it happens through his son Jesus Christ that's exactly what happens through
[time=1733] we've just heard from the Mitchell's and Corbin and Josh and Dayton and Amanda and Jamie all associated with our body who've went to great lengths great costs to go and represent the message
[time=1748] of Jesus in the area where they felt called our hope today is that we can connect the thoughts of
[time=1754] those who are going to our yours and mine our call to go with the good news so you're sitting there
[time=1763] and you're saying Rick come on I'm not feeling called to go anywhere I'm staying right here
[time=1769] I'm not I'm not a pastor I'm not a missionary well guess what neither am I I'm a technology guy
[time=1780] my kids say I'm a geek yeah that's you can laugh at that that's fine I'm a technology guy I'm a
[time=1788] geek I'm a technology evangelist some of my customers call me Josh rang from last week he deals with
[time=1796] finances and ministry he's a normal guy so am I the elders that serve you here as leaders
[time=1806] they're comprised of accountants architects financial managers pharmacists retired educators
[time=1816] and engineers business executive sales reps for small businesses web development managers
[time=1823] one is retired from missions and drive school bus another serves on fellowship for Christian
[time=1832] athletes we're normal men with families kids lives to manage things to deal with
[time=1844] but every one of us just like you today want you to know I want you to know and I want you to be
[time=1852] convinced we want you to be convinced that Jesus and his gospel matters to you and to those that
[time=1859] you need to love and care for it does not matter where you get your paycheck it should not be the
[time=1867] determining factor for your mission or your purpose when it comes to sharing the gospel we really
[time=1874] must consider what Francis Chan said nothing else in life will ever matter unless it's about
[time=1880] loving God and the people he created that's who we are that's who we're called to be
[time=1887] so our goal today is threefold first to paint your portrait of God's heart God's heart for the
[time=1894] lost those that don't know him those that don't believe which in by the way includes northeast
[time=1900] Fort Wayne the second is remind you that the gospel message is universal simple and timeless
[time=1907] those three things universal simple and timeless and then finally that God calls each of us
[time=1913] not just Caleb in a layer not just the people on the screen he calls each of us ambassadors for Jesus Christ ministers of reconciliation passengers and witnesses for him that's what we're here to talk about so open your Bible or iPad or whatever method you think that you have in front of me to see God's
[time=1934] word and we're going to talk about that first fill in the blank the very first bulletin point is God's heart God's heart is for lost sinners but before we start let me pray that
[time=1945] Heavenly Father we beg you today that your word would not return void
[time=1951] God that you would understand that you would help me to convey so they understand
[time=1959] the messages that you have today thank you so much for those who have already spoke and thank you God for your word and pray that it holy spirit would use it in ways that bring
[time=1970] about change in our lives and not not make us comfortable God I beg that you would remove our
[time=1977] comfort and break our hearts for what breaks yours in Jesus name amen that first one letter A
[time=1985] God's heart is for lost sinners if you look turn to Luke 19 Luke chapter 19 verses 1 through 10
[time=1992] we get to the story of a short guy a short guy named Zacchaeus Zacchaeus climbs up into a tree
[time=1999] and it says Jesus entered Jericho chapter 19 verse 1 a man was there by the name of Zacchaeus
[time=2005] he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy he wanted to see who Jesus was but because he was
[time=2011] short he could not see over the crowds we ran ahead and climbed a sycamore fig tree to see him
[time=2019] and saw Jesus since Jesus was coming that way when Jesus reached the spot he looked up and said to him Zacchaeus come down immediately I must stay at your house today so we came down at once and
[time=2031] welcomed him gladly all the people saw this and began to mutter and look what they muttered
[time=2039] he has gone to be the guest at the house of a what a sinner huh
[time=2047] huh a sinner but Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord look Lord here and now I give half of my
[time=2056] possessions to the poor and if I have cheated anybody out of anything I will pay back the four times the amount Jesus said to him today salvation has come to this house because this man too is
[time=2068] the son of Abraham for the son of man came to seek and to save the lost the lost
[time=2076] I love this description that John MacArthur uses for sinner sinner was a term that the Jews used
[time=2083] to describe people who had no respect for the mosaic law or the traditions and were therefore
[time=2090] the most vile and worthless of people that's what they call the sinner what does it mean for you to
[time=2099] look at somebody and you know who it is you know who it is that stirs up that heart thing inside of you that makes you think that's what he's talking about those are those tax collectors those are
[time=2114] those kinds of guys that's who Jesus came for lost and sinners it's what Josh Howard talked about
[time=2124] placing himself in public transportation public transportation so he could regularly interact
[time=2130] with people that don't know the Lord what would you be willing to do where would you be willing to
[time=2136] place yourself amongst sinners vile most worthless of people from an eternal perspective John 3
[time=2147] 16 through 18 God's heart for the world is the lost for we all know 13 excuse me 16
[time=2156] for God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life but let's keep going please for God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him Jesus save the world through
[time=2173] Jesus whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe stands condemned already
[time=2183] that's the gospel believe not condemned don't believe condemned it's clear
[time=2189] because and why are they condemned because they have not believed in the name of God's one
[time=2197] and only son I love this I love the him how deep how deep the father's love for us
[time=2206] how vast beyond all measure we just singing he is he would give his only son
[time=2212] to make a wretch his treasure first Timothy one says it's a trustworthy saying worthy of complete
[time=2223] acceptance Jesus Christ came to forgive sinners of which I'm the greatest Paul said that the guy that wrote two-thirds of the New Testament wretched man make a wretch his own a treasure
[time=2235] Jesus Christ came into the world to save the lost and to save sinners
[time=2242] so some of you may be thinking today that lost it has absolutely nothing to do with your garment
[time=2250] GPS not working or you having been Googled by Google Maps how many of you have ever been to a spot that you followed your Google Maps it took you there and you show up and guess what it's not there anybody ever have that happened besides me yeah Google isn't perfect just like us
[time=2265] lost has nothing to do it has absolutely nothing to do with age, color, race, job, poverty, wealth,
[time=2280] geographic location in the world or anything of this sort absolutely nothing being lost means
[time=2287] lost to an eternal judgment without Jesus because of sin and unbelief that's what being lost is
[time=2295] God's heart is that it's for the lost his resolution was the sending of his one and only son Jesus
[time=2304] the gospel so that by faith we might believe and then become witnesses the section second
[time=2312] section in the outline your letter B capital letter B the gospel message is and the first one is
[time=2318] universal Caleb said it just so to be really clear the language may change the location may
[time=2326] change the the time may change the people that you're talking the people that are talking to
[time=2334] and being all of that may change but the gospel is universal it's the same one that
[time=2342] they're telling to the students on Saint Francis campus they're telling it on Fort Wayne at any church that's talking the day that preaches the gospel it is the same it's universal and you know why because the lost sinners are everywhere they are everywhere they are in Uganda yes that's true
[time=2362] they are in Poland yes that's true but they are in the middle of Fort Wayne Indiana and you work
[time=2368] with them and so do I you live next to them they're lost because they don't know Jesus
[time=2376] because they haven't believed X one eight says but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes
[time=2385] on you and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and Judea and Sumerian to the ends of the earth
[time=2393] we really as elders in January really have gotten got to a spot that we really felt that we are
[time=2399] called to we've been going really well we've sent teams all over the place we've sent teams to Africa in Kenya and Africa's Kenya's in Africa but we we went to Uganda we've went to Poland we've
[time=2413] went all over the place we're going again but the elders were led in January we really believed
[time=2419] that God has led us to another spot to keep and while that stays that we make sure that we don't
[time=2425] forget that we have a Jerusalem right here there's a Jerusalem Jerusalem is that close proximity
[time=2431] old city Jerusalem was about 220 to 250 acres and I know some of you have no clue what that means
[time=2438] so I'm just going to tell you what that means is if you look here you can see the curve of 930 there on the lower left hand corner 930 and Colosseum Boulevard up at the top you look at all of that
[time=2451] the truth is here's 250 acres that's bigger than 250 acres maple crest boulevard over there
[time=2457] tree boulevard back there a lemur right straight out those doors and state street you make that
[time=2465] little trapezoid right there and you got about 250 acres that's Jerusalem that's our place that's
[time=2471] the reason on the 15th that we're going to have a movie night that's the reason that we're going
[time=2477] to do something that does reach out to the people that are here because we believe we have something
[time=2484] to offer them and guess what it's not nothing to do with a movie yes it is because we want them to
[time=2490] come but it's about the gospel of Jesus Christ because that's what changes and that's why we do it in Jerusalem our Jerusalem is the area of closest proximity that's where we'll be handing
[time=2502] out invites please be willing to do that even if you don't want to see the movie come be with us
[time=2508] come serve come serve the families that are that are going to be here the gospel message is universal small letter be there the gospel message is simple you heard
[time=2521] Corbin Corbin the guy that led us in worship that knows a whole bunch of theological terms what did he say that he wanted Corbin says man I wish I knew a really simple way that didn't use a bunch of
[time=2532] words because my words that worked in English don't work in Polish it's simple we are committed and
[time=2539] we have for the last two weeks we have committed to a series called unashamed in the first hour if you haven't went somewhere to participate in that you need to because we're doing Roman 6 23
[time=2550] for the wages for the wages yeah I hear some whispering it already you can even say it out loud
[time=2556] for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord that's simple the bridge illustration all of those things were committed to doing that it is
[time=2567] not complicated second Corinthians 5 21 says it in a totally different way but I really love it
[time=2577] God made him Jesus who had no sin to be sinned for us so that we might become the righteousness
[time=2585] of God it's a substitution thing God wasn't Jesus wasn't sinful we were he took it now we become
[time=2595] righteous the final one there is it's timeless universal simple timeless it's the same message
[time=2606] that Paul and the disciples told two thousand years ago it's consistent it's very consistent
[time=2615] the third point in your section in your outline capital C is one that I believe deeply God calls
[time=2626] each one of us each one of us every one of you sitting here today God calls each one of us if
[time=2632] you've named the name of Christ second Corinthians 5 16 through 21 if you flip to there this is a
[time=2639] powerful passage because it even addresses that if we're a new creation so now from now on we
[time=2647] regard no one from a worldly point of view that we once regarded Christ even in this way
[time=2654] we do so no longer therefore if anyone is in Christ qualifier if you are in Christ if you're not
[time=2662] this doesn't apply be really clear if you are in Christ you are a new creation the oldest passed
[time=2669] away behold the new it's come I love it and it says all this is from God who reconciled us to
[time=2679] himself through Jesus and gave us gave us the ministry of reconciliation
[time=2687] that God here's what it is God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ not counting people's
[time=2697] sins against them and he is committed to us committed to us the ministry of reconciliation
[time=2704] the message of reconciliation excuse me and we are therefore you me those that have trusted Christ
[time=2713] we are therefore Christ's ambassadors as though God were making his appeal through us we beg you
[time=2722] employ you on Christ's behalf be reconciled to God and then we get to the gospel again God made him who knew no sin to be sinned for us though when him we might become the righteousness of God just remember I want to remind you an ambassador is a representative of a kingdom
[time=2740] but sent to another kingdom right an ambassador the embassy exists in the foreign country
[time=2752] that's where ambassadors go we are aliens and strangers in this place we are put here for a
[time=2758] purpose and the embassy that we're representing is the church of Jesus Christ and it is the safe
[time=2765] place for people for people to come and you are an ambassador you me every one of us are ambassadors
[time=2774] doesn't mean that you're a preacher doesn't mean that you're a missionary it means that you have a message you have a safe place you have a gospel we are all that we're ministers of reconciliation
[time=2789] God calls each of us ambassadors of Christ letter small letter a b we're ministers of
[time=2798] reconciliation as though God were making his appeal through us Caleb and Larry said it he doesn't need us but for some reason by his design he chooses to use us I don't get that
[time=2811] messed up guy that I am that you guys are for some reason God chooses to paint a tapestry
[time=2820] to weave a tapestry in the lives of us that's appealing to the people that we meet with
[time=2827] I don't get that but it works think of this I use it all the time I used it last week
[time=2835] the number of people in this room and we're going to do it this way this morning how may it only
[time=2842] raise your hand if the person that led you to Christ if the primary person that led you to Christ
[time=2849] is a pastor or youth pastor or somebody that was vocationally getting paid to do their job raise your hand if you fall into that category look at that so does that mean the rest of these
[time=2861] people aren't saved no those meant that they were brought to people by family members by
[time=2868] co-workers by baseball coaches by people that love Jesus and just made it real and you accepted it
[time=2875] right that's the rest of the people that are here the truth is I had a friend of mine
[time=2883] a friend that I love dearly I've worked with him long I've worked with him longer than I've been married to my wife his name is Mike
[time=2898] Mike told me 28 years ago raves do you understand that there's people to walk into your office
[time=2910] that would never walk into a pastor's office or a counselor's office either one and ask you questions like what does the Bible say about X it's the same reason that you have
[time=2921] that privilege yourself as a school teacher as somebody that works in mowing cemeteries
[time=2929] somebody that drives the school bus somebody that has grandkids
[time=2936] I want to remind you verse 18 verse 18 is really really clear all this is from God
[time=2943] it is nothing that we do you absolutely can do nothing to save your friend
[time=2950] be faithful I love the way my friend Caleb just he didn't say it this morning but I love the way
[time=2956] he says it we get to be farmers we're called to be farmers and throw seed throw the seeds of the gospel and Jesus the Holy Spirit the Father God is the one that brings the fruit he is the one that
[time=2967] brings the harvest all we have to do is share the story you can do that you've been empowered to do
[time=2975] that I love this this is from you would talk about timeless gospel this is from Charles Haden
[time=2983] Spurgeon in 1860 1860 you are naked the robe in which you shall be dressed as of God you are filthy
[time=2992] the washing is of God you are unworthy your worthiness must be of God you are guilty
[time=3002] your pardon is of God all you are bitten to do is simply be a receiver
[time=3009] and a minister and a witness come with your empty picture come with your empty picture
[time=3017] and hold it now to the flowing fountain of eternal life that's the only place it's when you got
[time=3025] Jesus that you become a minister and an ambassador and until then you don't have anything to offer
[time=3031] but then you have it God's heart is for the lost God's heart is for the lost you can't miss that
[time=3043] folks the gospel is universal simple and timeless don't miss that and then ultimately God calls
[time=3052] each of us it's not the guy that stands in this pulpit on a Sunday morning job to save your friend
[time=3059] it's God's job I don't get to play a part you have a sphere of influence and I don't we are ambassadors of the embassy of Jesus Christ aliens and strangers in a foreign land
[time=3072] we are ambassadors of another kingdom and we've been given a ministry as though he were making
[time=3082] his appeal through you and I that's a hard call right there what if what if what if Rick
[time=3090] Raber was the only gospel somebody ever met as the choir comes up and we remind you of this
[time=3101] the whole process the last fill in the blank that you have there the whole process starts
[time=3107] advances and ends with God starts advances and ends with God we just by some design we get to
[time=3116] participate so here you go if you are a new creation in Christ today if that's the first
[time=3124] qualifier the question isn't about whether or not you were called it isn't about whether or not
[time=3130] you're called but to the who and to the where do you're called to deliver the message yeah you are an ambassador for Jesus Christ
[time=3144] God has given you a sphere of influence and as we are going we get to the impact the world for
[time=3150] Jesus a man to man has said it this morning up on her video she says I can't be in charge of my
[time=3159] fruitfulness a fruit tree doesn't stand out there and goes straight out the fruit you don't do that
[time=3166] the fruit only comes because of your relationship with Christ and she said by this I can't be in
[time=3175] charge of my fruitfulness but I can influence my own faithfulness beg God to your ministry
[time=3184] is that and most of us don't get our pay we don't get our paychecks from a church the bottom of your bulletin I'm going to leave you with this bonding your bulletin is a really simple prayer and we're going to sing it right now I'm part of it God give me eyes to see those around me who don't know you give me eyes eyes to see
[time=3209] eyes to see that don't know Jesus and then break my heart mess my heart up mess my heart up and
[time=3217] make it feel like yours does for them help me to be a willing messenger of your truth
[time=3225] those aren't hard things guys those are not hard things please
