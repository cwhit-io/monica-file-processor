[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] >> You're going to want to stand for this, Jonathan is going to sing the part that I want to sing here in about two measures.
[time=49] [MUSIC]
[time=59] Here we go.
[time=65] I heard a noble story, how a savior came from glory.
[time=71] I gave this light upon Calvary to save a wretch like me.
[time=78] I heard about his groaning, of his precious but does for me.
[time=84] And I repented of my sins and won the victory.
[time=91] >> Oh, victory in Jesus, my savior forever.
[time=97] He sought me and fought me with his redeeming blood.
[time=104] He loved the air I knew him.
[time=107] And all my love is to him.
[time=111] He punched me to victory.
[time=114] He made the cleansing blood.
[time=118] [MUSIC]
[time=122] I heard about his healing, of his cleansing glory healing.
[time=129] How he made the land to walk again and cause a blind to see.
[time=135] And then I cried dear Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit.
[time=142] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory.
[time=148] Oh, victory in Jesus, my savior forever.
[time=155] He sought me and fought me with his redeeming blood.
[time=161] He loved the air I knew him and all my love is to him.
[time=168] He punched me to victory.
[time=171] He made the cleansing blood.
[time=176] [MUSIC]
[time=191] I heard about a mansion, he was built for me in glory.
[time=207] And I heard about the streets of gold beyond the crystal sea.
[time=214] About the angels singing, the old redemption story.
[time=221] And some sweet day I'll sing a bear the song of victory.
[time=227] Oh, victory in Jesus, my savior forever.
[time=235] He sought me and fought me with his redeeming blood.
[time=242] He loved the air I knew him and all my love is to him.
[time=249] He punched me to victory.
[time=252] He made the cleansing blood.
[time=255] Oh, victory in Jesus, my savior forever.
[time=261] He sought me and fought me with his redeeming blood.
[time=268] He loved the air I knew him and all my love is to him.
[time=275] He punched me to victory.
[time=278] He made the cleansing blood.
[time=284] Oh, victory in Jesus, my savior forever.
[time=309] Come on, praise him.
[time=321] I will feast at the table of the Lord.
[time=334] I won't hunger anymore at his table.
[time=345] I will feast at the table of the Lord.
[time=358] I won't hunger anymore at his table.
[time=370] Come on, he weary.
[time=373] Come and fight.
[time=376] His joke is easy.
[time=379] His burnt life.
[time=382] He is able.
[time=385] He will restore at the table of the Lord.
[time=398] There is peace at the table of the Lord.
[time=411] I won't hunger anymore at his table.
[time=422] There is healing at the table of the Lord.
[time=435] And I won't suffer anymore at his table.
[time=446] Come on, he weary.
[time=450] Come and fight.
[time=453] His joke is easy.
[time=456] His burnt life.
[time=459] He is able, he will restore at the table of the Lord.
[time=474] I know he has the place for me.
[time=481] Oh, what joy will fill my heart.
[time=487] With the saints around the mercy seed of God.
[time=499] Come on, he weary.
[time=502] Come and fight.
[time=505] His joke is easy.
[time=508] His burnt life.
[time=511] He is able.
[time=514] He will restore at the table of the Lord.
[time=524] At the table of the Lord.
[time=539] I'm invited to the table of the Lord.
[time=553] When you came in this morning, you may have got a yellow card, would you just pull that
[time=580] out for me real quick?
[time=581] Grab something to write with a pen.
[time=583] If you don't have a pen written down, they would be happy to get you something to write with.
[time=589] Get your yellow card out.
[time=590] There's going to be some questions that come up on the screen, and it's just between you and the Lord.
[time=598] So if you need to move over a little bit, husbands and wives, spread out a little bit.
[time=601] If you need to lower them, if you want to hide, this is not a time when you cheat.
[time=605] You know, don't cheat off your neighbor.
[time=608] These questions are going to push the envelope a little bit.
[time=612] Some of them are kind of -- you're going to feel a little vulnerable.
[time=615] You're going to feel like, "I don't want to answer that," but I'm just asking this morning
[time=621] between you and God, just for some raw honesty.
[time=625] Nobody's going to know what you answered.
[time=627] Nobody's going to know what you write down.
[time=630] So between you and God, if you would just -- it's either yes or no, and the questions will come up as the band plays.
[time=637] So take this time to talk with God, answer these questions, and we'll come back to this conversation soon.
[time=642] We'll see you in the next one.
[time=643] See you later in the morning.
[time=644] Thanks.
[time=645] [MUSIC - 255 seconds]
[time=926] Well, good morning, everyone.
[time=931] Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=932] My name is Steve Webster.
[time=933] I'm a teaching pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=936] I'm so glad that you're watching.
[time=938] We say often that we're glad that you're watching because we believe that you're part of our family.
[time=942] We've always felt that way.
[time=944] We believe that today.
[time=946] We believe it this morning.
[time=947] You have heard us say in recent months that we've now got two different service times on Sunday morning.
[time=953] I'll just talk to you about that for one minute, if I could.
[time=956] We have two different services on Sunday morning these days.
[time=959] For most of this calendar year, 2015, we've been meeting at nine o'clock for a community hour.
[time=964] We meet in smaller settings across the campus for students, for people of all ages.
[time=969] We have established intentional times to meet in smaller settings and really do life together.
[time=975] That's at nine o'clock all over our campus.
[time=978] And 1030 is our one Sunday morning time where we're worshiping together, where we sing songs together.
[time=983] We hear from God's Word, from our teaching team.
[time=986] So if you're watching on Sunday morning, you have still have time to come join us at 1030 in our sanctuary.
[time=992] We would love to see you and love to put faces to all those people that we know are watching in our community all across our area.
[time=1001] We are so grateful that I've been a part of your lives for many years.
[time=1004] And we pray that we would be so for many, many years to come.
[time=1008] But please join us this morning at 1030 if you are able.
[time=1012] This morning at 1030, we're going to have a baptism service.
[time=1014] And there is nothing that's more encouraging to us to listen to the stories of how people have come to know Jesus.
[time=1020] We've got kids being baptized today.
[time=1023] We've got fully grown adults being baptized.
[time=1025] God is at work in our community.
[time=1028] And we're so grateful to be hearing from them what it is that God has done, what it is that He is doing, and what it is that He will do.
[time=1037] And on that note, what you're going to see this morning is the last message in our series that we've referred to as unashamed.
[time=1045] We have been talking these last several weeks, our teaching team, you've heard from all of us, has been talking about what it means for us to share our faith.
[time=1054] What it means for us to be good communicators of the gospel.
[time=1058] And this morning, Jesse Hannah, our ministry operations pastor, is going to be sharing with you a very simple and very profound and very beautiful message about responding in faith to the good news, the offer of salvation that's found uniquely and beautifully and perfectly in Jesus.
[time=1074] We believe that salvation is by grace through faith in Christ. And this morning is an opportunity for you to respond in that way.
[time=1083] I can't wait for everybody here from Jesse. He's a good friend. He's a passionate communicator.
[time=1087] And this morning is going to be a time for you to be blessed by what you hear and maybe even a chance for you to respond in faith to Christ for the first time.
[time=1097] We would love to see that happen this morning.
[time=1100] Coming up in the month of June on June 7th at 6 p.m. is our annual high school commencement, our graduation ceremonies.
[time=1109] I have been at the school teaching for 12 years. The school has never been in a stronger place.
[time=1115] The school is being led exceptionally well. Our students are excited. We are going to send off another round of graduates this year to impact the world for Christ.
[time=1125] And we are so proud of them and want you to come and be part of that celebration. It really is a commencement. Commencement is the beginning.
[time=1132] And we want you to come and be a part of celebrating with these families as we've had a chance to work with their kids over the years.
[time=1139] I've been at the school teaching for 12 years. So I arrived at black when these kids were in kindergarten.
[time=1145] It's been really fun and really gratifying to watch them grow in grace, to grow and to mature into followers of Christ that will indeed be equipped to go out and impact their world for Christ.
[time=1159] If you want to call the number on the screen, there are openings and vulnerabilities at certain grades in our school.
[time=1164] We would love for you to be blessed as my family has been blessed and so many other families have been blessed by the school over the years.
[time=1171] We've just passed 40 years of operation as a school. The school, again, has never been in a healthier position.
[time=1177] We're so grateful for what God is doing there. I would love for you to experience that as well.
[time=1184] I want to encourage you, again, as I mentioned earlier, if you've been watching the Bible Hour for many, many years and been blessed by it,
[time=1192] we want to encourage you to become a part of what we refer to as the Founders Club.
[time=1196] The Founders Club has been made up of people for many, many years who are giving financially to this ministry, to the Bible Hour ministry.
[time=1204] The Bible Hour has never been financed by a few. It's been financed by many people who give donations monthly of $10 to $20.
[time=1212] That's how you can be a blessing to this ministry as we pray and hope has been a blessing to you.
[time=1218] So information regarding being a part of the Founders Club is on the screen there before you. We would encourage you to, again, be a part of a lot in this broadcast to continue to be a blessing to our entire region as, again, it has been for many, many years.
[time=1232] Again, thank you for watching. Thank you for being part of our family. We would encourage you and ask you to please pray for us.
[time=1238] The church is in a season of transition. We're looking for a senior pastor and we would encourage you to pray for our pastor discovery team and the elders as they lead this church.
[time=1247] We have very good reason to be hopeful about the future. Can we talk to you more about that as this journey continues?
[time=1254] So thank you for watching. Thank you for being a part of our family. Have a great week. God bless.

[time=1435] [MUSIC - 62 seconds]
[time=1504] (audience applauds) - I don't know about you, but this series has just been really fun.
[time=1513] This series has been really challenging.
[time=1515] This series is, I think, exactly what our church needed.
[time=1518] I mean, God has just been providing.
[time=1520] He's been giving us ideas and things to do to kind of make sure that we continue to proclaim Christ.
[time=1527] What a series it's been.
[time=1529] I'm so pumped about.
[time=1530] I'm still excited.
[time=1531] It's week four, but I hope we never lose sight of what the things that we've learned.
[time=1535] I hope you're praying and serving or attending the big screen movie night and the big serve that's coming.
[time=1540] That's going to be wonderful.
[time=1541] And our tagline for the whole series is that the gospel can be understood as the announcement that God has reconciled himself to the world by sending his son Jesus to die as a substitute for our sins.
[time=1555] I'm so thankful that that's true.
[time=1558] We've titled it unashamed.
[time=1560] There is something really wonderful about partnering with God and proclaiming Christ to a lost and broken world.
[time=1566] That's why he saved us.
[time=1567] That's why we're here.
[time=1568] That's why we're a church.
[time=1570] And so I just want to look back.
[time=1571] I'm going to recap a little bit.
[time=1572] Then we're going to zero in on Jesus.
[time=1574] And then we're going to do something I hope will impact us and just fire us up to go to the world and tell them of his great name.
[time=1583] Week one, Webby, talk to us about these obstacles that hold us back.
[time=1587] There's fear, there's rejection, there's this worry of, "Wow, what if I just don't know what to say?" And I know I've been there.
[time=1594] I'm sure you've been there maybe on a plane or you've been at a coffee shop or somebody like, "I should say something to that person." "I should say something." You know, if you're on a plane, you're like, "I don't want to be that guy to talk to all the time." You know, they don't want me to talk.
[time=1607] You know, you feel that nudge, but you just don't.
[time=1609] There's a little fear there.
[time=1611] But I know we felt that.
[time=1612] Those are real things.
[time=1614] And I can look back and there were times when I was, I feel like I was pretty open or kind of bold about my faith.
[time=1619] Like at the Ball State University, I had to take a speech class.
[time=1623] And one of the first speeches I had to do, it was like they had, there was a sign speech, a how-to speech.
[time=1628] So I did my speech on how to come to know Jesus as your Lord and Savior.
[time=1632] And I used the four spiritual laws, one, two, three, four.
[time=1634] That was my steps, how to come to know Christ as Savior.
[time=1636] And it was wonderful.
[time=1637] And people, no, I don't know if they came to Jesus, but it was good.
[time=1640] You know, they heard the gospel.
[time=1642] And then the second speech was an informative speech.
[time=1644] I informed them of the love of Christ.
[time=1646] You know, I was just, I was preaching the squirrels and trees.
[time=1649] I mean, I was right off my conversion, right after I came to Christ.
[time=1651] I was talking to everybody.
[time=1653] I didn't care who it was.
[time=1654] It was wonderful.
[time=1657] And then there have been times when I just didn't.
[time=1659] I don't know why.
[time=1661] Just didn't say it.
[time=1662] Maybe the fear, maybe just embarrassing.
[time=1664] You fill in the blank.
[time=1666] And I just think, man, that is just so silly.
[time=1668] And when we look back, we look at Jesus took a crown of thorns, and I'm afraid of what people might think of me.
[time=1674] He took a crown of thorns.
[time=1677] He was spit at and beaten.
[time=1679] And I'm worried that I might have the right answer.
[time=1682] The good news is Jesus is the answer.
[time=1687] For the joy set before Him, He took the cross for us.
[time=1691] So I just hope, you know, in America we have these amazing buildings.
[time=1694] We have facilities.
[time=1695] We have so much money.
[time=1697] We do.
[time=1698] We just do.
[time=1700] And we have, we even have like, we have Christian TV.
[time=1703] We have Christian music.
[time=1704] We have Christian comedians.
[time=1705] But we don't have enough Christian commandos.
[time=1708] Those are willing to count the cost and go to the world and tell of His great name.
[time=1713] We need to step up in the world like no other time in history and proclaim Jesus.
[time=1718] We just do. We just do.
[time=1721] And I believe that He can help us overcome any obstacle because He did.
[time=1725] And He's with us.
[time=1726] He's with us to the very end of the age.
[time=1729] Week two, Josh Rang.
[time=1730] He's sitting over here.
[time=1731] I love that man.
[time=1732] I love how he leads his family.
[time=1734] How he leads his little girls and his wife.
[time=1736] He's just a man.
[time=1737] A man in the heart of Jesus.
[time=1739] He's just man.
[time=1740] He's just wonderful.
[time=1741] And his example challenges me to be a better leader in my home.
[time=1744] I'm thankful for Josh.
[time=1745] Thank you, Josh.
[time=1746] And he reminded us about we don't share, we don't do this evangelism thing to earn God's favor.
[time=1752] We don't do this as a religious checklist.
[time=1755] We do this out of our position in Christ.
[time=1758] So our position in Christ can never change.
[time=1761] We are forgiven.
[time=1762] He has set us aside.
[time=1764] He has called us holy.
[time=1765] And our position is what is where that flows out of.
[time=1769] And out of all the people in the world, it's a get to.
[time=1772] Not a have to.
[time=1774] Another story from Ball State.
[time=1776] I'm just walking down the hall one day.
[time=1778] I can remember the guys.
[time=1779] Jeff and Jeff are playing video games.
[time=1781] And there's Michael and his weird roommate.
[time=1782] I can't remember his name.
[time=1783] And he was playing Rob Zombie music.
[time=1784] He's the guy who taught me how to play guitar.
[time=1786] My first song was a Rob Zombie song because that's all he knew.
[time=1789] And that's all I had to know how to play anything else.
[time=1791] So I wanted to learn guitar when everybody went out to drink.
[time=1793] You know, they'd go drinking.
[time=1794] I'd learn how to play guitar.
[time=1795] That's what I do in my dorm room.
[time=1796] They come home and make fun of them.
[time=1797] You know, it was fun.
[time=1798] It was great.
[time=1799] And so, and so I'm just, well, I'm just thinking I get to the drink and fountain.
[time=1803] I think, gosh, how do all the students on this campus?
[time=1806] How do all the kids, all the people who were there, I get to know Christ.
[time=1811] It was like this light bulb memory in my mind.
[time=1814] It's still there.
[time=1815] And it just hit me like, wow, I get to know Christ.
[time=1819] It is a privilege to know him.
[time=1821] It's not a burden.
[time=1822] And sharing about him is such a wonderful gift that God has asked and partnered with us.
[time=1828] He says, I want to use you.
[time=1829] I saved you to use you.
[time=1831] I'm just so thankful for that.
[time=1833] But it's out of a position in Christ not to earn God's love or God's favor.
[time=1837] And then week three, Raber, with his beautifully colored shirt.
[time=1843] Mine's in the cleaner's eye to wore it.
[time=1846] And he wouldn't let me borrow it.
[time=1849] He reminded us that God has a heart for the lost.
[time=1852] Oh, what a message.
[time=1856] I mean, that's what God's been doing since the beginning of Genesis.
[time=1860] When the fall occurred, God went into rescue mode.
[time=1864] And all the way through history, he's been interviewing.
[time=1867] He's been stepping into history in real time and real space and doing real things with real people.
[time=1873] Ordinary people, just like us.
[time=1875] And he's been working his plan of salvation ever since Genesis.
[time=1880] God has been pursuing us because we were lost.
[time=1885] And we need him.
[time=1886] He knew that the best place for us is to be connected intimately with him.
[time=1891] The story of the scriptures is, as I read it, as I approach it, is this narrative kind of runs all the way through.
[time=1900] Some would call it a meta narrative.
[time=1901] It goes all the way through scriptures from beginning to end as this.
[time=1904] That God will be our God and we will be his people.
[time=1909] God wants a people for himself.
[time=1912] And for us to be his people, he had to take care of the problem which was sin.
[time=1917] And so he sent his son, Jesus, to die in that cross once and for all to take care of sin so that we could be his people.
[time=1927] Us, we get to be his people.
[time=1930] I love that story, the ultimate act of sending his son.
[time=1935] So God is a heart for loss. He also said that we're a bunch of missionaries and this one to two mile radius is our Jerusalem.
[time=1942] I love that picture.
[time=1944] I love the picture that he threw up there with the field and just a little scan.
[time=1948] I think it was a Google map. It's just wonderful.
[time=1951] I'm so thankful that he shared that with us.
[time=1955] Our theme verse for the whole series has been Romans 1 16.
[time=1960] It says this, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes."
[time=1968] First of the Jew, then the Gentile.
[time=1970] And if you go on, 17 says this, "For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last."
[time=1978] Just as it was written, "The righteous will live by faith." We aren't saved by our deeds, salvation from beginning to end has always, always, always been about where we place our faith.
[time=1989] Where we place this thing, or what we put our trust in, or who.
[time=1995] Every decision, every thought, every action comes down to this right here.
[time=2000] In whom do I place my trust?
[time=2004] Do I trust my own instincts, my own desires, my own efforts, my own convictions, or do I trust in the name of Christ?
[time=2014] That salvation right there, that's the question that we answered daily.
[time=2018] Who am I trusting in today when I go to work?
[time=2020] When I go in, I sit next to somebody, I know they need Jesus, but I'm fearing that.
[time=2025] Who are you trusting, you're trusting yourself?
[time=2027] See, when you trust in Christ, those obstacles fly away.
[time=2031] And there's a boldness.
[time=2032] There's this power that comes into you called the Holy Spirit, and you can just start talking.
[time=2036] You don't know what you said.
[time=2037] What did I say?
[time=2038] I don't know, but he liked it.
[time=2039] We're going to go to coffee.
[time=2040] There's just this idea that whom do I place my trust?
[time=2044] Jesus answered this.
[time=2045] There's some guys in the crowd asking the question, they said, what must we do to do the works God requires?
[time=2050] What do we do?
[time=2051] How do we do this thing?
[time=2052] Kind of a religious question.
[time=2053] They're kind of like, what's the checkbox so we can do this thing?
[time=2056] Jesus answered the work of God as this, to believe or also it can be translated to trust in the one he has sent.
[time=2064] Salvation.
[time=2065] Not on works, not on merits, not on anything you do or anything you're about, but trusting in the one he has sent.
[time=2074] It's not about the church you attend or the clothes you wear, the size of your bank account, how smart you are or how smart you're not, how good you are.
[time=2081] If you go to church or that church or not church at all, it's not about the music we play, it's not about the band or choir or anything like that.
[time=2088] It's not about lights, camera, action, not the number in the budget or how many butts are in the seats.
[time=2096] It's about Jesus.
[time=2097] For there is no other name.
[time=2102] No other name.
[time=2106] And whom do I place my trust?
[time=2108] Salvation, this Acts 4, 12, this is kind of the, for this message today, wherever it's headed, wherever it's going, I don't even know.
[time=2115] But Acts 4, 12 says this, "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name, under heaven, give it a mankind by which we must be saved."
[time=2126] So do me a favor, I want you guys, these two sections, I want you guys to be, no, I want you two sections to be named, no other, you guys are other, and this guy's in the balcony or name.
[time=2135] So when I point to you, I want you to say your words, everybody understands pretty easy.
[time=2139] No other names, no other names, no other names, no other names.
[time=2146] You may say that in your sleep tonight, because I just want to talk a little bit about my Savior, his name is Jesus, he's my best friend in the whole wide world, and I just want to talk to you about him a little bit.
[time=2154] Matthew 121, an angel speaking to Joseph kind of shows up, and Joseph was having this hard time, you know, marrying Mary because she was praying, he's like, how does she get pregnant?
[time=2164] Because I know it wasn't me, right, and he's just trying to figure this all out.
[time=2167] And the angel tells him, "Joseph, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
[time=2175] She will give birth to a son, and you have to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."
[time=2185] Come on, come on.
[time=2189] Right, and then in Luke 1, 29, an angel comes to Mary, but this couple, they're just angels are all over this couple.
[time=2195] This has never happened to me and Amy, no angels have ever come to us.
[time=2198] I'm a little disappointed, but maybe it'll happen in the future.
[time=2201] He comes to Mary, she's a little freaked out about being pregnant, about what this message is.
[time=2206] And the angel says, "Don't be afraid Mary, you have found favor with God.
[time=2210] You will be a child to give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.
[time=2216] He will be great, and he will be called the son of the Most High.
[time=2220] The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever.
[time=2225] His kingdom will never, and I hope it's okay to keep talking about Jesus, for there is no other name.
[time=2233] Philippians 2, let's keep going.
[time=2235] Oh, this is so key.
[time=2237] This humility that Jesus had and who he was as fully God and fully man is so powerful for us to look at about our Savior Jesus.
[time=2246] It says this beginning in verse 5, "Any relationships with one another have the same mindset, have the same approach, have the same integrity as Christ Jesus."
[time=2253] Verse 6, "Being in the very nature God did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage.
[time=2262] Rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness and being found in appearances of man.
[time=2272] He humbled himself by becoming obedient to death, even death on a cross.
[time=2277] Verse 9, "Therefore God exalted him, lifted him high to the highest place, and gave him the name that is above every name.
[time=2286] That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and earth and under the earth.
[time=2293] And every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God, the Father.
[time=2298] There is no other name under which we must be saved. Thank you, Jesus. I hope it's okay to keep talking about our Savior today.
[time=2307] Colossians 1, 15. I'm not going to read the whole thing, but the bullet points are this. Jesus is the image of God.
[time=2315] All things were created through him and for him.
[time=2319] All things are before him. All things hold together in him. The pew you are sitting on is held together at an atomic level by Jesus.
[time=2328] The oxygen that's circulating in your lungs is being held together and operating in the name of Jesus.
[time=2334] All things hold together in him. He is the main man, the leader, the head of the church.
[time=2339] He is our leader. He is our Savior. He has supremacy in everything. In him dwells the fullness of God, verse 20.
[time=2348] And through him to reconcile to himself all things, not just salvation is huge. It's cosmic.
[time=2357] From the stars to the universe to us to the animals to the planets, everything is going to be reconciled in Jesus because there is no other name.
[time=2368] Salvation is found in no one else, but there is...
[time=2373] That's right. That's right. Our faith is empty without Jesus. Our hope is phony. Our churches are just buildings.
[time=2381] Our Christian music is just a tune. Our future is lost. Our love is void. Our gospel is false.
[time=2387] And we're fools. But with Jesus, for there is no other name. Our faith is full. Our hope is real.
[time=2398] Our churches, our houses of truth, our music is celebration of Jesus. Our future is secure. Our love never fails.
[time=2405] Our gospel is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes. Everyone who believes.
[time=2414] I hope it's okay to talk about Jesus today. For there is no other name. Salvation is found in no one else.
[time=2423] There is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.
[time=2430] Now, if the greeters would come back out for me, what they're going to do is they're going to redistribute the cards.
[time=2437] Okay? And hopefully you didn't put your name on that card. Okay?
[time=2442] And you're going to have, in your hand, eventually you're going to have somebody else's card.
[time=2447] Okay? So they're going to do that.
[time=2458] And we're going to kind of walk back through these questions.
[time=2461] Like I said, we just, a little quick recap, week one, week two, week three.
[time=2466] I spent some time with just that, with no other name in heaven we must be saved.
[time=2471] And so now I just want us to know, as we kind of put a bow on this series, hopefully we never stop doing these things,
[time=2480] because of what Christ did for us. I just want us to know that we are in this together.
[time=2486] I don't care if you're on staff, if you've been a missionary for years, if you work at a lawyer's office or a doctor's office
[time=2494] or if you're a school teacher or if you're a stay-at-home mom, amen moms, thank you moms for all that you do.
[time=2499] Happy Mother's Day, right? I don't care where, yeah, we can clap for moms.
[time=2503] I would be lost without my wife, who's my kid's mother, and also my mom, brother.
[time=2514] So we're in this together.
[time=2517] We are our brothers and sisters in Christ, and we are more similar than we know.
[time=2522] I think Jesus has intersected our lives in very similar ways.
[time=2529] So did everybody get a card?
[time=2532] Words, okay, take your time, plenty of time. I don't have to be anywhere until two.
[time=2539] You're scared.
[time=2544] What we're going to do is we're going to walk back through the questions, okay?
[time=2549] And don't worry, because you have somebody else's card, so you're not? Nobody's going to know what you marked.
[time=2559] Thanks, greeters, you guys are awesome. Thank you for doing that. It's so wonderful.
[time=2566] Questions are going to come up on the screen.
[time=2572] First question there is, have you ever struggled with depression, fear, or anxiety?
[time=2578] This isn't to make anybody feel bad or dirty. We're all the same. We're brothers and sisters in Christ.
[time=2585] If you're on your little sheet, you're a little yellow sheet, if there's a yes, circled, or checked or underlined,
[time=2592] I just want you to stand right where you are. Just stand up.
[time=2602] Okay, sit down.
[time=2604] You're going to get a workout today. Let's go to number two.
[time=2608] Do you have anything in your life that you haven't been able to quit doing?
[time=2612] If you have a yes, check the new card, just stand up.
[time=2619] Okay, sit down. If you get tired, stand and you can just raise your hand. It's cool, but please keep standing for those who can.
[time=2626] Number three. Do you have anything in your life that you are constantly ashamed of? Stand up if you have a yes.
[time=2636] We are in this together. There's no other name. We must be saved. Sit down. Let's do number four.
[time=2643] Have you ever thought about or attempted suicide? If you have a yes on that, just stand up where you are.
[time=2650] It's real. It's real. What Jesus does in our stories is real. It's not just you. We are in this together.
[time=2658] Number five. Have you ever cut yourself or intentionally hurt yourself?
[time=2663] If you have a yes, checked, just stand up. It's real. Let's do number six.
[time=2673] Have you ever had a sexual relationship with someone you aren't married to? If you have a yes, check, just stand up.
[time=2683] Get down. Number seven. Have you ever abused drugs or alcohol? If you have a yes, check, just stand up.
[time=2693] There's no other name. No other name, correct? No. Number eight. Do you have any secrets that you've never shared?
[time=2702] Ever share with anybody? If you have a yes, check, stand up. We're similar. What Jesus has done in our lives is amazing.
[time=2713] Number nine. Have you ever lied to someone in an effort to hide your actions?
[time=2719] Number ten. Last one. Do you struggle with attractions, temptations or thoughts that you know are outside of God's will for your life?
[time=2741] Thank you for your honesty. Thank you for doing that. Thank you so much.
[time=2747] There is power in the name of Jesus. We are together in this.
[time=2777] There is power in the name of Jesus. There is power in the name of Jesus.
[time=2803] There is power in the name of Jesus. To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.
[time=2833] All sufficient sacrifice, so freely given such a price.
[time=2859] But our redemption, heaven's gates sing wide. We believe there is power in the name of Jesus.
[time=2881] There is power in the name of Jesus. There is power in the name of Jesus. To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.
[time=2904] To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.
[time=2918] There is power in the name of Jesus.
[time=2948] Every one of us has been affected by Jesus Christ and what his story, he has taken over our story, God's story, the Gospel weaves its way from beginning till today.
[time=2958] If that story is your story, if you know that you are forgiven in Christ, Church, I want you to know that God's story is all about what God does.
[time=2969] He rescues us and he forgives us and he cleans us up and then he uses us for his kingdom. See by the name of Jesus, he rescues us.
[time=2981] He declares us holy in Christ. By the name of Christ in Jesus, he fills us with his presence. By the name of Jesus, he calls us to love God and to love others and to tell his stories.
[time=2993] Roman 8 tells us now, therefore, there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. See, if that's your story today, if you're here today and you know that Christ has forgiven you, if you know that he has rescued you and filled you with the Holy Spirit,
[time=3011] if you know that that is your story, I want you to stand right where you are, know that Jesus has forgiven you, everything on that list and everything, a million other things, he has forgiven you.
[time=3034] And if you're here today and you don't know that you're forgiven, come right down here. It's open. There will be some elders here if they want to pray. If you want to pray and you want to gas Christ into your life today, you can do that as the band continues to sing.
[time=3047] It's open right here. Don't be ashamed. We have all been saved by the same Savior that you're coming to find out about today. Okay? Go ahead.
[time=3064] In the name of Jesus, there is healing in the name of Jesus. There is healing in the name of Jesus.
[time=3082] So break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. There is healing in the name of Jesus. There is healing in the name of Jesus.
[time=3098] There is healing in the name of Jesus. There is healing in the name of Jesus.
[time=3113] Break every chain, break every chain, break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.
[time=3143] There is an army, right in the name of Jesus. There is an army, right in the name of Jesus. There is an army, right in the name of Jesus.
[time=3164] It's right here. There's an army, right in the name of Jesus. There is power in the name of Jesus.
[time=3193] There is power in the name of Jesus.
[time=3204] To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.
[time=3219] There is power in the name of Jesus.
[time=3235] Last question, last question. Will you in the office at school with friends with family wherever you go?
[time=3249] For we are not ashamed of the gospel because it's the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes.
[time=3258] The salvation is found in no one else for there is, try that again, under heaven by which mankind must be saved.
[time=3271] Will you tell his story? Will you tell about what he did in your life so that he can do that in theirs?
[time=3278] If that's something you are willing to do, you're going to say, "Yeah, I want to do that. I want to tell of his story."
[time=3284] If you're already standing, you can just raise your hand. Just talk to God today.
[time=3288] They're going to sing it one more time. Will you tell his story?
[time=3297] There's an army rising up. There's an army rising up. There's an army rising up.
[time=3320] Break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.
[time=3328] There is power in the name of Jesus. There is power in the name of Jesus.
[time=3343] There is power in the name of Jesus. Break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.
[time=3373] I hope you all will tell his story. This week there's going to be an opportunity for you. It's going to happen.
[time=3384] There's going to be, it's going to come. You're going to be ready. You think you're ready. And then all of a sudden there's going to be this fear.
[time=3389] Or something's going to tell you not to. Something's going to hold, try to hold you back. Remember, remember that there is no other name.
[time=3398] Remember that there is power in the name of Jesus. Start singing that song in your head and be bold church. People of God, we can do this.
[time=3408] We can take the name of Jesus to the ends of the world. Just be ready and be willing.
[time=3414] When you feel fear creeping in on you, there is power in the name. When you feel rejection might be possible, there is power in the name.
[time=3422] When you feel like you're not sure, you might not know what to say. There is power in the name. When you feel like you're past, you don't feel like you're clean enough.
[time=3431] Or good enough to tell somebody about the Lord, about Christ, about Jesus. Remember, you're forgiven by the power of Jesus. You can, you can, you can.
[time=3444] There is no other name that Jesus. The band is going to sing us out. I'm going to pray as they continue to play. God, we are so thankful and we are humbled.
[time=3455] And we are in awe of you, God. Not only did you rescue us, not only did you send your son to save us by taking on the cross, but you have called us.
[time=3467] You are allowing us to be with you in this endeavor to take your name to all the earth. Thank you, Jesus. God, thank you for calling us because you want to use us.
[time=3483] Thank you for saving us because there is no other name. God, I pray we will tell your story. We are that army rising up to tell of your glory and to tell of your name. Amen.
[time=3499] To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.
[time=3517] Power, wonder, working power, anything. We believe, we believe.
