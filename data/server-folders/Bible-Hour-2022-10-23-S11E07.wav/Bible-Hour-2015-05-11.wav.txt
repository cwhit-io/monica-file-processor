[time=255] [MUSIC - 20 seconds]
[time=280] (audience applauding) - All right, church, let's all stand and sing together.
[time=290] We serve an awesome God today.
[time=295] [MUSIC - 212 seconds]
[time=512] Bless your name.
[time=514] - We want to talk just for a minute.
[time=519] It's my friend Darren McCown.
[time=522] Darren's gonna be baptizing some kids here in a minute, but wanted to just take a second to talk about baptism and what we think about it here at this place.
[time=531] When we read the Bible, the New Testament, there are no unbaptized believers in the New Testament.
[time=537] Everywhere you go, that active obedience is part of what it means to follow Jesus.
[time=541] And these people who are being baptized this morning are acting in obedience in light of that.
[time=547] I hope of nothing else today that their example to you serves to follow in that, in their footsteps, that there are no unbaptized followers of Jesus.
[time=557] We encourage you with that today.
[time=558] There's no spiritual power in this water.
[time=562] I hope that you will erupt with joy.
[time=565] I told them that you would, that you will erupt with joy at what has already happened in their life, that now you get to be involved in the first way publicly with.
[time=576] So we just rejoice at what Christ has already done in their lives, and now it's being made public for all of us to join.
[time=582] They're joining themselves in some way to this place, having already joined themselves with Jesus.
[time=587] So that's what we're doing this morning.
[time=589] I'm glad you're here.
[time=590] Please do, I said you would do, and erupt with joy once they are baptized.
[time=595] Darren, here we go.
[time=596] - I wanna introduce to you to my friend, Ryan Mitchell.
[time=608] He's going to read his testimony for you.
[time=611] - My name is Ryan Patrick Mitchell.
[time=616] I am 18 years old, and I'm getting, I'm graduating this year from Blackout Christian School.
[time=620] My parents are Chris and Brenda Mitchell, and a little shout out to my siblings Erica and Corey.
[time=626] I am an active member of the church choir.
[time=629] You may have seen some of my moves.
[time=631] Some of my hobbies include watching movies, listening to music, drawing, or coloring, and of course dancing.
[time=640] I became a Christian when I was five years old.
[time=644] My mom had told me about Jesus, and I thought it was a one-time prayer, and it was good.
[time=649] All through my childhood, I was a good little Christian child and went through the motions up until my freshman year of high school.
[time=655] I had put in no effort to have a serious relationship with God, no motivation, because one, I thought I was saved, and second, I was too busy with what I wanted instead of listening to God.
[time=668] I started putting other things in front of Christ, my relationships, my desires, my needs.
[time=673] I was doing these things, and I knew they were wrong, but there was a hunger inside me that I needed to satisfy, but only could be satisfied by God, but I didn't want to make that commitment.
[time=685] Eventually, I began to notice what I was doing.
[time=687] I realized that when I would hear sermons or sing the songs, I wouldn't be moved, I would just feel empty.
[time=693] The summer of my sophomore year, I decided I needed to change.
[time=697] But I didn't know where to start, or if I could even try to come back to God since I had ignored him for so long.
[time=702] Then one day I heard a song that opened my eyes and brought me out of my own little world.
[time=707] How deep the Father's love for us by Salah.
[time=709] Behold the man upon the cross, my sin upon his shoulders.
[time=714] Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice call out among the scoffers.
[time=718] It was my sin that held him there until it was accomplished.
[time=722] His dying breath has brought me life.
[time=725] Just picturing Jesus on the cross, bloody and beaten, God, the creator of the universe, turning his face away from his only son because of my sin.
[time=735] This shows me how much love, mercy and forgiveness God has for me and all of us.
[time=740] After that moment, I began to read scripture.
[time=742] I got a prayer journal and today I have two blank pages left in the whole thing.
[time=747] At the end of the summer of my sophomore year, I truly accepted Christ as my savior.
[time=752] Today I stand before you and I can now say I have a close relationship with God.
[time=757] In the future, I pray that as I go up to college
[time=763] that people will be able to see the fruits of the spirit through my life.
[time=767] I also pray that I will be able to tell people about the good news of Jesus.
[time=771] I want to be baptized today because two reasons.
[time=774] One, it is an act of obedience to God.
[time=777] And two, I'm tired of hiding.
[time=779] I want to show my church family that I'm serious about my faith.
[time=782] I've finished with these words.
[time=784] I will not boast in anything.
[time=785] No gifts, no power, no wisdom.
[time=788] But I will boast in Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection.
[time=791] (audience applauds) - Ryan, Patrick Mitchell in view of your confession of faith
[time=811] to Jesus Christ.
[time=812] I baptized you in the name of the Father, the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=819] (audience applauds) - All right, I want to introduce to you Lily Buchanan.
[time=837] She is the daughter of Adam and Amy Buchanan.
[time=842] Step up here so your dad can see you.
[time=844] Adam plays guitar in the band right down there.
[time=849] And this is Lily.
[time=850] And Lily, I want to ask you a couple of questions.
[time=852] Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and want to walk with him for the rest of your life?
[time=857] - Yes.
[time=858] - And do you want to show everyone here today, friends and family, that news today by your baptism?
[time=864] - Yes.
[time=865] - Excellent.
[time=866] (audience laughs) - What do I do?
[time=870] - Yeah, Lily and Buchanan.
[time=873] In view of your profession of faith to Jesus Christ, I baptized you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=881] (audience applauds) This is Grace Buchanan, Lily's sister.
[time=896] Also the daughter of Adam and Amy Buchanan.
[time=900] Step forward so your dad can see you.
[time=902] Here is right down there.
[time=904] All right, let me ask you a couple of questions, Grace.
[time=907] Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and want to walk with him the rest of your life?
[time=911] - Yes.
[time=912] - And do you want to get baptized today to show everyone that?
[time=916] - Yes.
[time=917] - All right, excellent.
[time=919] Thanks for letting me be part.
[time=921] Grace, Lee Buchanan.
[time=925] In view of your profession of faith to Jesus Christ, I baptized you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[time=934] (audience applauds) - Hey guys, this is Ed, this is my friend Ed Fry.
[time=945] Say hi, Ed.
[time=946] - Hi, Ed.
[time=947] - Ed and his wife, Joni are new to our church since about March of this year.
[time=951] Ed's gonna tell you his story real quick.
[time=953] - My name is Ed Fry.
[time=957] I am married.
[time=958] I have two dogs, Sadie and Gas.
[time=960] I am a carpenter by trade.
[time=961] I enjoy refinishing old furniture, fishing, and mushroom hunting.
[time=965] I was a troubled guy at a young age unable to accept the love of Christ.
[time=969] He never gave up on me as I look back now.
[time=971] I can see God's hand at work in my life countless times.
[time=975] His mercy and grace have been amazing.
[time=978] I have since accepted his love into my heart and my life, and I thank him for the cross.
[time=983] - Amen.
[time=984] [AMEN] (audience applauds)
[time=994] - Ed, based on your profession of faith in our Lord Jesus, I'm pleased and honored to baptize you today in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

[time=1558] [MUSIC - 33 seconds]
[time=1595] (music)
[time=1625] [MUSIC - 113 seconds]
[time=1750] [cheers and applause]
[time=1767] I apologize if I had a whole lot more fun right there than all of you did.
[time=1771] Just a little bit.
[time=1774] We are, it was mentioned that we are going to have some guest speakers in the next few months from maybe different churches, and it is my privilege to introduce our first one.
[time=1785] This is Stewart Cruz from County Line.
[time=1788] That is where I attended before I came here.
[time=1793] And Stewart is my pastor, my mentor, and he's a great friend, so Stewart Cruz, ladies and gentlemen.
[time=1802] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1811] Well, I'm telling you right now, that was God's music.
[time=1814] [laughter] Nothing like a little Southern Gospel flair.
[time=1818] You know that's gonna be music in heaven, right?
[time=1820] [laughter] Great job, fellas.
[time=1824] Well, it's very nice to be here at Blackhawk this morning.
[time=1826] I've always felt a tie to this church for a variety of reasons.
[time=1830] One of your former pastors, Rick Hawks, is a good friend of mine, mentor to me, your last pastor, Kelly Bird, really good friend of mine.
[time=1839] We worked on some ministry initiatives together.
[time=1842] My brother, Mitchell, was a teaching pastor here for a little while.
[time=1846] Probably see the resemblance a little bit.
[time=1848] [laughter] And our county line choirs.
[time=1852] Our choir and your Blackhawk choir did some combination things and led worship together and that kind of thing, so that's been fun.
[time=1859] And I could go on about the Blackhawk connections, but I just want to let you know it's a real honor to be here.
[time=1864] And I truly believe that Blackhawk ministry's greatest days are ahead.
[time=1870] And any church that can put up with Darren McCown as a worship leader has got to be a group of saints, I'm telling you.
[time=1877] [laughter] I don't know if he's the same here, but if you ever noticed
[time=1885] that the words of a worship song that are up on the screen must be viewed by Darren as nothing more than suggested lyrics.
[time=1893] [laughter] I feel your pain, I feel your pain.
[time=1899] But seriously, I'd like to thank the leadership here at Blackhawk for asking me to share with you this morning.
[time=1904] Would you bow your heads with me for prayer?
[time=1906] Glory, thank you so much for this opportunity to gather together and worship you and to learn from you.
[time=1913] God, we ask for your Holy Spirit to work in our hearts and minds.
[time=1918] We thank you for your word that you've provided to us.
[time=1920] You didn't just set the world into motion and say good luck, but you set the world into motion.
[time=1925] You provided us with your word to provide us with a blueprint for life.
[time=1931] And we thank you for that, and we count it as a true privilege to have a relationship with the Almighty God.
[time=1940] And so, God, I pray that all of our hearts and minds would be open today to your Holy Spirit so that when we leave here today, we'll know exactly what it is that you want us to know, do, or change in our lives.
[time=1955] And we thank you in advance for what you're going to do in our midst and what you already have done.
[time=1960] We pray this in Jesus' name.
[time=1962] [AMEN] You know, home life for a pastor is not the easiest thing in the world
[time=1970] because on Sunday mornings you're teaching everybody how to live life.
[time=1975] And then your family gets to watch you live life behind closed doors where nobody's watching.
[time=1981] And to see if you're practicing what you preach.
[time=1985] For instance, I can be pretty selfish at times.
[time=1989] In my past, I've been guilty of cutting out the middle piece of a cake in a cake pan.
[time=1997] It's true.
[time=1998] You can imagine my family's reaction when they take the foil off of a pan of cake and there's a hole right in the middle because I took the middle piece out.
[time=2008] Well, I took so much heat for cutting out the centerpiece of a cake at family gatherings that I had to alter my plan.
[time=2016] So I just started kindly letting others go ahead of me to cut their piece of cake.
[time=2021] And then when I saw that the middle piece was about ready to be next, I would just kind of slightly slip into line and cut my favorite piece in a way I'd go.
[time=2031] Well, this was working beautifully for several family gatherings until one day my mother-in-law, loud enough for everyone to hear, says, "Stu, are you just acting all nice and letting everybody else go first
[time=2044] just so you can get the middle piece of the cake?" Silence.
[time=2051] Do I lie or do I tell the truth?
[time=2055] And since I love Jesus, I told the truth.
[time=2058] And I said, "Yes, you caught me.
[time=2060] I can't believe you picked up on that." She says, "I can't believe you, pastor Stu.
[time=2067] What about all those servants we hear about not being selfish?" Let it and all those kind of things.
[time=2073] Then my wife and my kids join in, "Yeah, pastors do.
[time=2076] What about not being--" I mean, bottom line, I should have lied.
[time=2082] (Laughter)
[time=2088] I'm just kidding, of course.
[time=2090] But yes, I'll admit, I can be selfish at times, and if we went around the room, I'm sure all of you would probably admit that you can be selfish at times, too.
[time=2098] Currently at Black Hawk Ministries, you're in a transition period.
[time=2102] And it's always a challenge to decide where a church heads during a transition period.
[time=2107] Is there anything we should change?
[time=2109] What are we doing well?
[time=2111] What kind of passage should we look for?
[time=2113] How soon can we get rid of Darren McCown?
[time=2116] (Laughter) And the questions go on.
[time=2119] Notably, there's one question that I think we all secretly ask during these transition times, and that is, what will the future hold for me or my family?
[time=2131] What will the future hold for me or my family in this time of transition?
[time=2136] We wonder if we'll like the new direction, if we'll like the new pastor, will the church meet our needs?
[time=2143] And if we're not careful, the focus can become about ourselves instead of focusing on the good and the better things like the guys sang about a few moments ago.
[time=2153] Today we're going to learn that a church on mission is unstoppable.
[time=2158] A church on mission is unstoppable.
[time=2161] To illustrate, turn with me in your Bibles or your mobile devices to Mark chapter 10, we're going to be looking at verses 35 through 45.
[time=2170] Mark chapter 10 verses 35 through 45.
[time=2172] While you're turning there, I'll just set this up for you a little bit.
[time=2175] Jesus is headed to Jerusalem with his disciples to complete his mission, and he spends a moment talking about dying and coming back to life, a very deep and important message for his disciples.
[time=2189] And listen, beginning with verse 35, the immediate response that Jesus receives.
[time=2195] Says, "Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee came to him, teacher," they said, "we want you to do for us whatever we ask.
[time=2204] What do you want me to do for you, you ask?" They replied, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory." "You don't know what you're asking," Jesus said.
[time=2214] "Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?" "We can," they answered Jesus, said to them.
[time=2221] "You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant these places belong to those for whom they have been prepared."
[time=2233] When the 10 heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.
[time=2237] Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lorded over them and their high officials exercise authority over them, not so with you.
[time=2249] Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.
[time=2253] Whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.
[time=2257] For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve.
[time=2261] And to give His life as a ransom for many." Okay, like I said, Jesus had just had a heart to heart with His disciples about what was to come
[time=2271] and the very first thing out of the mouths of two of His closest followers is, "Hey, Jesus, we want you to do for us whatever we ask."
[time=2282] Really?
[time=2284] Is that not the epitome of selfishness?
[time=2289] But Jesus humors them and says, "Okay, what do you want me to do for you?"
[time=2295] I think Jesus was humoring them a little bit because He's probably thinking, "Maybe if they ask this out loud, they'll hear how selfish they sound."
[time=2306] So they ask in verse 37, "Can we sit at your right and your left when you rise to glory?"
[time=2312] Now remember, they still thought that what Jesus was going to do would have some political ramifications of some kind.
[time=2320] But whatever that was that He was going to do, they wanted special seats at the table.
[time=2326] Jesus then asked them if they can drink the cup and be baptized like Him.
[time=2332] And again, they don't know what Jesus is talking about, but they say, "Oh, sure can?
[time=2336] Just a little formality?
[time=2338] We can do that." By the cup, Jesus meant His coming suffering.
[time=2343] And by His baptism, He meant being submerged in the baptism of His death.
[time=2348] That's why Jesus in verse 39 says that they will indeed drink the cup and participate with Him in the baptism because Jesus knew the suffering and the deaths that awaited
[time=2359] James and John because they were followers of Him.
[time=2362] But when it comes to granting the seats to the left and to the right of Jesus, He deflects this to His Father in heaven because Jesus had a mission to accomplish.
[time=2373] Jesus had a mission to accomplish.
[time=2375] He wasn't about to get sidetracked with selfish requests.
[time=2381] In verse 41, we see that the other 10 heard about what was going on and the Bible says that they were indignant.
[time=2387] They were mad.
[time=2388] They were jealous.
[time=2391] They didn't want James and John getting in the special treatment.
[time=2396] What about them?
[time=2397] So like a good coach for those of you in the sports world, Jesus says, "All right, guys.
[time=2402] Huddle up.
[time=2403] They're going to have a conversation." Jesus reminds them that the world loves to seek positions of authority and importance.
[time=2411] The world loves to look out for themselves.
[time=2415] Jesus says four very important words in verse 43.
[time=2420] Not so with you.
[time=2425] If you're able circle or underline or highlight those words in your Bible, not so with you.
[time=2434] In those four words, Jesus is saying followers of Christ are different from the world.
[time=2440] We are not about ourselves.
[time=2443] Rather, Jesus says, "If you want to be great, be a servant.
[time=2448] If you want to be first, be last." He then delivers the key in verse 46.
[time=2455] He says, "For even the son of man," speaking of himself, "did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many." You see, even Jesus, God and human flesh, the King of kings, the Lord of lords, did not come
[time=2470] to be served but to serve.
[time=2473] He set the example of being others focused.
[time=2476] But beyond that, what was his focus?
[time=2481] His mission.
[time=2486] To give his life on the cross for the sins of all mankind.
[time=2491] Jesus was saying it's not about what you can get out of it.
[time=2495] It's not about looking out for yourself.
[time=2497] It's about the mission.
[time=2500] When Jesus' followers get that, great things can happen because a church on mission is unstoppable.
[time=2509] At some point in your near future, Blackhawk will have a new pastor.
[time=2513] When that happens, you'll need to be careful not to slip into that selfish mode that James and John and the other disciples slipped into.
[time=2520] Here's how it typically goes.
[time=2522] When a new pastor joins a church, there's the honeymoon stage.
[time=2526] Most everyone's excited about the new person, they're excited about the new direction, they're excited about the new mission and vision.
[time=2533] But then as time passes, congregational members begin to look inward.
[time=2538] It inevitably happens in every church.
[time=2541] And people start wanting things for themselves.
[time=2547] Young married people want a young married ministry.
[time=2551] Parents want top-notch ministry for their kids and for their youth and for parents.
[time=2557] Men want a men's ministry.
[time=2561] Empty nesters want something for them.
[time=2563] Senior citizens want something for them.
[time=2566] Singles want a ministry for them.
[time=2569] Divorce people want a support group.
[time=2571] And on and on it goes depending on the category of people that you fall into.
[time=2575] And are all those things bad?
[time=2577] No, of course not.
[time=2579] But over time, as the congregation expects the church and the pastor to be all about these needs, rather than focused on the bigger picture of reaching people for Christ, its mission failed.
[time=2594] And it happens just like it did with Jesus' disciples.
[time=2598] As people get to know the pastor, they expect special treatment.
[time=2601] They expect special attention.
[time=2605] They expect a position of power.
[time=2609] And then jealousy sets in.
[time=2611] Pet projects set in.
[time=2613] And pretty soon everybody's trying to get what they want and they complain when they don't.
[time=2617] And when that happens, things go south in a hurry.
[time=2621] And please hear me. I'm not saying it's happened here.
[time=2623] I don't know your current state.
[time=2625] I'm simply giving advice for the future because like I said, I believe Black Hawk's greatest days are ahead.
[time=2631] You have a great facility.
[time=2635] It was marveling at it as I walked around before the service.
[time=2639] You have a great location.
[time=2641] You have spirit-led leaders.
[time=2645] You are made up of some of the finest Christian people that I have ever met.
[time=2650] And I mean that.
[time=2652] Sky is the limit for Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=2656] But in order for the Holy Spirit to open the floodgates, every member of Black Hawk has to be about the mission of reaching people for Christ.
[time=2668] And a church on mission is unstoppable.
[time=2675] Here's what I'd like every one of you who call Black Hawk home to say to your next pastor.
[time=2680] Instead of going to your next pastor and asking for what he can do for you, instead say pastor, I just want you to know that I'm all in on our mission to reach people for Christ.
[time=2691] How can I be used to help accomplish that?
[time=2697] I'm telling you right now, words like that would be so life-giving to your pastor, but you better have your cell phone ready to call 911 because he's probably going to fall over.
[time=2707] But here's why this is important.
[time=2710] If your pastor gets sidetracked and gets into people-pleasing mode,
[time=2716] rather than staying in mission mode, you're in trouble.
[time=2721] You're in trouble.
[time=2722] Help your pastor and your church stay in mission mode and avoid people-pleasing mode.
[time=2727] That doesn't mean he doesn't care about his flock.
[time=2732] But a congregation and a pastor who come together on one focused mission of reaching people for Christ
[time=2739] is an amazing thing to be a part of.
[time=2742] One of my favorite verses in the Bible is Matthew 16-18 when Jesus told Peter,
[time=2748] and I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church and the gates of hell will not overcome it.
[time=2756] That's what we're a part of, church.
[time=2761] We're a part of something that the gates of hell cannot even contain.
[time=2766] That means the church is on the offensive.
[time=2770] And I love that imagery because church doesn't play defense.
[time=2775] It's like in sports, commentators always talk about, have you ever noticed that?
[time=2779] They always talk about the defense looking tired.
[time=2783] Well, the defense looks tired tonight.
[time=2785] But they never talk about the offense looking tired, do they?
[time=2788] They never say, boy, the offense is looking tired tonight.
[time=2791] That's because everybody loves playing offense.
[time=2794] Everybody loves playing offense, but people get tired playing defense, defending the goal or whatever it is sport you're in.
[time=2800] The same is true of churches.
[time=2803] Too many churches are playing defense and trying to protect themselves, trying to protect what they've always had or the way they've always done things or their pet projects or ministries, etc.
[time=2817] But when we focus on the mission, the bigger picture of reaching people for Christ and play offense, the church doesn't get tired.
[time=2826] We don't get tired.
[time=2828] And a church on mission is unstoppable, and even the gates of hell cannot stop it.
[time=2836] But always remember this.
[time=2838] Who did Jesus say was building His church?
[time=2842] A lot of people always think He told Peter to go out and build the church, but that's not what He said, is it?
[time=2847] Jesus said on this rock, I will build my church, didn't He?
[time=2855] You see, exciting things happen when a church joins Jesus in what He's already doing.
[time=2861] He's building His church, He's building His kingdom, and when we join Him in that, awesome, exciting things happen.
[time=2869] At the church I pastor, we have an invite Sunday every September where we give a dollar for every person that attends to a ministry in our surrounding community.
[time=2879] And with donors chipping in, sometimes it gets up to $5, $7 a person this last September.
[time=2884] We were able to split over $11,000 between two ministries, local ministries.
[time=2889] But that invite Sunday is a great, non-threatening way to invite someone to church who doesn't already go to church.
[time=2896] And I often ask our people at County Line, how long has it been
[time=2902] since you sat next to somebody in church that you invited, somebody who doesn't go to another church somewhere else?
[time=2910] How long has it been since you sat in a church service next to somebody that you invited?
[time=2916] For some it's been years, years.
[time=2923] Well, there's a gentleman named Greg who was attended County Line his entire 63 years of life, someone who would be slow to change, right?
[time=2936] But he decided he was going to join in on this, and he was going to invite a guy who lived down the road that he's known for years, but he knew this guy well enough to know that he would never step foot in a church.
[time=2949] Greg was nervous and thought for sure this guy was going to say no, but to his surprise, the man accepted.
[time=2958] Studies show, by the way, that 75% of non-churchgoing people will accept an invitation to church if someone they know invites them.
[time=2967] 75%, the odds are in your favor.
[time=2971] The man that he invited cried through that service.
[time=2978] He kept attending and eventually he gave his life to Christ and he was baptized.
[time=2984] In his testimony, he said, "I thought by attending church on that invite Sunday, I was doing Greg a favor."
[time=2995] Little did I know he was doing me the greatest favor anyone ever had.
[time=3002] And all that took place because a guy who had attended our church for 63 years
[time=3009] gave up his desire for the church to serve him and said, "I'm going to do what I can to help accomplish the mission."
[time=3020] And think about this, that buy-in to the mission had eternal consequences in someone's life.
[time=3029] Think of that.
[time=3031] And when I asked Greg, I invited him up on our birthday celebration in February.
[time=3035] We celebrate our church's birthday every February.
[time=3038] And I invited him up as a long time attender, just interviewed him a little bit.
[time=3041] And I had no idea how he was going to answer this question, but I said, "In your 63 years at County Line, what was your most meaningful moment?"
[time=3050] And he said, "There's no question.
[time=3052] My most meaningful moment to me was when my friend accepted my invitation to County Line and eventually gave his life to Christ and was baptized.
[time=3060] Of all the things he'd ever done in that church in 63 years,
[time=3066] inviting someone and watching them give their life to Christ was the most meaningful thing he'd ever done and been a part of.
[time=3073] Just imagine if every church got this right.
[time=3076] Imagine if the people at County Line got it right.
[time=3078] If the people at Blackhawk got it right.
[time=3080] And we were all on mission with the bigger picture.
[time=3083] Just imagine what might happen to our surrounding communities.
[time=3088] I'm telling you, setting aside our selfish desires and joining Christ in his mission is the adventure of a lifetime.
[time=3096] And remember, in doing so, we're simply joining Jesus where he's already working.
[time=3102] So it takes the worry away.
[time=3105] We don't have to worry about the future of our church.
[time=3109] We don't have to worry about getting what we want.
[time=3111] We don't have to worry about budgets, and personnel, and ministries, attendance, offerings, and all of that.
[time=3119] Because when we join Jesus where he's working, all those things take care of themselves.
[time=3126] The worries disappear because a church on mission is unstoppable.
[time=3134] The guys are going to come back up and sing a song along these same lines just casting those worries behind letting Jesus take control and just kind of joining him where he's working.
[time=3147] And I think this is very fitting for what we've been talking about as we join Jesus in building his church and not worrying about all those things that get in the way.
[time=3169] I'm not going to worry.
[time=3174] I'm not going to fret.
[time=3177] I'm not going to speculate or contemplate what hasn't happened yet.
[time=3183] I'm not going to worry.
[time=3186] He's got the whole thing in his sense.
[time=3193] I won't let it haunt me.
[time=3197] I won't let it win.
[time=3200] I'm not going to ruminate or meditate on how it might have been.
[time=3206] I'm going to release it.
[time=3209] He's got the whole thing in his sense.
[time=3219] Maybe lately I started to resign.
[time=3225] So hearing those got only those.
[time=3228] It might just ease my mind.
[time=3230] I'm not going to worry.
[time=3233] I'm not going to fret.
[time=3236] I'm just going to wait and see it in between.
[time=3239] Give thanks for what I get.
[time=3242] I'll live in the moment.
[time=3245] He's got the whole thing in his sense.
[time=3250] Maybe lately I started to resign.
[time=3260] So hearing those got only those.
[time=3263] It might just ease my mind.
[time=3265] I'm not going to worry.
[time=3268] I'm not going to fret.
[time=3271] I'm not going to speculate or contemplate what hasn't happened yet.
[time=3277] I'm not going to worry.
[time=3280] He's got the whole thing in his sense.
[time=3318] I asked the guys if I could do something here at the end that we did at our church at County Line that when we first moved into our new worship auditorium we did this.
[time=3327] And then about a year and a half later we did it again because I felt like we needed to refocus on what was important.
[time=3336] And what we did is we dedicated our facility to the Holy Spirit working in people's lives in a variety of different ways.
[time=3346] And the way we did that and what I'm going to ask you to do is just to simply reach out and touch the pew in front of you.
[time=3354] Those of you maybe, I can't really tell how it's back there, but you may have to stand up and walk up to a pew if you don't have one right there in front of you.
[time=3363] Not on the person in front of you, but just on the pew itself.
[time=3367] And just to rededicate this facility and this ministry to what God has for you in the future.
[time=3375] And I'd love to just be a part of that with you guys as you do that this morning.
[time=3378] So would you reach out and touch that pew and bow with me for prayer?
[time=3384] Lord, I thank you so much for Black Hawk Church.
[time=3388] I thank you for all that it has done in our community in Fort Wayne and the beacon of light that it has been.
[time=3399] My God, as I said earlier to this group, I truly believe with all of my heart that their greatest days are ahead.
[time=3405] And on behalf of everyone in this room, we want to rededicate this facility into your hands.
[time=3415] We pray, God, that this would be a place that when people walk in, they feel the presence of your Holy Spirit in a very tangible way.
[time=3424] That they feel something different about this place as soon as they walk through those doors.
[time=3431] God, I pray that this would be a place where people who need you for salvation would find you.
[time=3438] I pray this would be a place where people who need to deepen their walk with you would be able to do that here with people that love them.
[time=3448] God, I pray for this to be a place where marriages are restored.
[time=3454] I pray this is a place for people who need hope where none currently resides that they would find it here.
[time=3463] I pray that this would be a place for people who are broken-hearted and feel lonely, that they would come into this place and they would feel loved and accepted like they never have in their life.
[time=3480] I pray that when people are in this room and they have relationships where they've held grudges or bitterness, they've withheld forgiving someone, that because they're in this place, your spirit begins to break down those walls in their heart and open them up to reconciling relationships.
[time=3503] God, your word says that your temple is a place of holiness and a place of wholeness.
[time=3512] And God, I pray that every person that comes into this building, whether they've been here for years or whether they're here for the first time, would feel that sense of wholeness in their life that only you provide.
[time=3527] And God, we look forward to what you have in store for Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3533] And we just rededicate this place to being used by you and join you in that effort as you continue to build your church and build your kingdom right here in the Fort Wayne area.
[time=3552] We thank you for the amazing privilege of being a part of that.
[time=3559] We love you, God. We thank you for your love and return, and we pray all of this in Jesus' name. Amen.
