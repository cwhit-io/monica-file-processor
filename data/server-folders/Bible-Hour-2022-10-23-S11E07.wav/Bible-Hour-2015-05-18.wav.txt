[time=0] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=40] >> Good morning, Black Hawk.
[time=45] So glad to see you all this morning that's worshiped the Lord.
[time=50] >> Behold, the lamb, the lamb that once was slain.
[time=56] He bled and died, and now forever reigns.
[time=61] He holds the world, his arms are open wide.
[time=67] That we may live through him now sanctify the joys.
[time=74] [MUSIC]
[time=79] We hold the church, the ones who turn to him.
[time=85] The man, the child, who turned away from sin.
[time=91] We sing to him, for he has called us home.
[time=97] And we declare that you are our Lord, we join.
[time=105] [MUSIC]
[time=108] Rejoice, the Savior is alive, rejoice, for death has been denied.
[time=120] Rejoice, his majesty is here, and our praises fill the air as we rejoice.
[time=132] [MUSIC]
[time=143] Behold, the King seated up on high, and we worship you to see you glorified.
[time=155] One day we'll see all our nations sing, that God, you reign, for all eternity.
[time=166] [MUSIC]
[time=172] Rejoice, the Savior is alive, rejoice, for death has been denied.
[time=184] Rejoice, his majesty is here, and our praises fill the air as we rejoice.
[time=199] [MUSIC]
[time=224] Rejoice in him, who gives us breath, for he will and died and rose against.
[time=302] Rejoice, the Savior is alive, rejoice, for death has been denied, and rejoice.
[time=316] His majesty is here, and our praises fill the air as we rejoice in him, who gives us breath,
[time=331] for he will and died and rose against, oh, rejoice in him, who gives us breath, for he will and died and rose against.
[time=348] Rejoice in him, who gives us breath, for he will and died and rose against.
[time=377] Good morning, everybody.
[time=384] My name is Steve Webster, I'm a teaching pastor here at the church, and we give.
[time=392] This is the time and the service where we give, and I feel like sometimes we're in a bit of a hurry, and I wish we wouldn't be as often as we are.
[time=404] If you have a Bible real quick or access to the Bible on your phone or whatever, would you go real quick to 2 Corinthians 9?
[time=414] This is going to be the basis in some ways what we talk about later on, but I want to just take a minute and just stop as these dear folks are waiting to receive your offerings and talk about what we're doing and why we're doing it.
[time=427] We do it in part to support the work of missionaries around the world, and that is worth doing greatly.
[time=436] But look at 2 Corinthians, if you would please, 2 Corinthians 9, just for a minute again this
[time=442] morning before we give.
[time=445] What you are about to do by placing those gifts in the offering plate is every bit as much an act of worship as what you just heard.
[time=454] I like to repeat myself.
[time=456] What you are about to do in the giving of your resources that God has given is every
[time=462] bit of much as much an act of worship as singing a song or even opening God's Word in a sermon.
[time=468] I hope that you always approach it that way, and we want to remind you that this morning.
[time=472] 2 Corinthians 9, verse 6 says this, the point is this, Paul is talking to people in Corinth about giving a gift to a needy church in Jerusalem, "Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly,
[time=483] and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[time=488] Each one must give verse 7, 2 Corinthians 9, as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly
[time=495] or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver, and God is able to make all grace
[time=502] abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound
[time=511] in every good work as it is written in Psalm 112, there will be a few pages back from that this morning in our sermon, but he has distributed freely, he has given to the poor, his righteousness endures forever, Paul's call for the Corinthians to give was in response to the great act of
[time=530] grace that he had done in their lives.
[time=532] Look at all that God has done for you, surely you can give to help these people in need.
[time=537] And I encourage you this morning, friends, that as you give, not only today, but whenever
[time=543] we're together, to give with that in mind, not under compulsion, not from a sense of
[time=549] guiltiness, but because God has given, did you hear what it says?
[time=554] All things that you need at all times in every way, so surely I can give, surely I can sacrifice
[time=562] and simply give back to him what he's already given to me.
[time=567] Can I pray for us before we give this morning?
[time=569] In light of that, God, thank you for today, and thank you for the dear people that make up this church.
[time=573] God, I'm so grateful to have had the chance to serve them for as long as we have, and
[time=579] I'm grateful.
[time=581] I'm grateful for the chance that we have today to worship you, God, with the giving over, the things that you've given back to us.
[time=587] You just trusted us, God, as stewards of what you've already given.
[time=591] And so God, I pray that we be cheerful givers today, that we would give in response to your amazing bounty and grace that you've given us that Randy just reminded us of, God.
[time=600] You have done this amazing thing, may our hearts overflow with generosity and gratitude
[time=606] for what you have done, prowl these things in Jesus' name.
[time=610] [AMEN] [MUSIC - 1 seconds] Please stand with us this morning, and let's sing about how good God is.
[time=619] You might want to be careful because you could have a whole lot of fun singing this on.
[time=628] [MUSIC - 276 seconds]
[time=907] I may have had more fun than you right there.
[time=910] [MUSIC]
[time=912] Let's sing another one.
[time=913] Love the Lord, your God.
[time=915] [MUSIC - 58 seconds]
[time=980] I will serve the Lord with all my heart, with all my soul, with all my mind, and with all my strength.
[time=1015] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=1031] Repeat after us.
[time=1033] I will love you, I will love you, I will praise you, I will praise you.
[time=1051] I will serve you, I will serve you, I will trust you, I will love you, with all my heart, with all my soul, with all my heart, with all my soul.
[time=1080] With all my heart, with all my strength.
[time=1086] I will love you, Lord, with all my heart, with all my soul, with all my mind, and with all my strength.
[time=1117] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1120] Hey, man.
[time=1122] [MUSIC]
[time=1124] Well, good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Bible Hour. My name is Steve Webster. I'm a teaching pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=1130] And as we often do, we're just really grateful that you're watching, that you're part of our family.
[time=1134] We do see you as part of our family, and we love to hear from you. We love to know how we're doing, how far our reach goes.
[time=1143] We are constantly astounded to hear from people that watch the program from all over our region and are encouraged by it,
[time=1152] and that actually come to be with us physically.
[time=1155] We have services on Sunday morning. Our 9 o'clock hour is our fellowship hours. We would call it a Sunday school hour where we meet in smaller communities.
[time=1163] We believe that life change happens best in those smaller settings.
[time=1167] The 1030 hour is our actual worship service in our sanctuary.
[time=1172] So if you're watching on Sunday morning, you still have time to come out and physically be with us in our services, starting at 1030.
[time=1179] So please come, please come say hello to myself or someone that you recognize in this service.
[time=1186] We would love to hear from you and love again to make you feel like you're a part of our family.
[time=1191] My role at the church is changing in the coming months due to some new budget realities at the church.
[time=1197] I'll be going back to teach the school full time, so you might be seeing a little bit less of me in the coming months, but I've been so grateful to have been a part of this broadcast and a part of this ministry for several years.
[time=1208] I want to just quickly draw your attention to a couple of things coming down the pike in the coming days.
[time=1214] Sunday, June 7th is our commencement exercises of our school.
[time=1220] We're 40 years in as a school serving this community. The school has never been in better shape.
[time=1225] We're so grateful and so proud of the class of 2015.
[time=1228] Please come and be a part of it. Please come and celebrate with our graduating seniors.
[time=1232] They're great kids and they're going to great schools from our school and we think it's appropriate for you to come and celebrate with them.
[time=1240] Starting on June 9th is our summer women's Bible study.
[time=1245] We would encourage you to come be part of that. Sue Stunt does a great job of coordinating all those efforts.
[time=1251] We love to see people in our church come together to fellowship to rally around the Word of God and to be encouraged.
[time=1258] The times that they're meeting and the place they're going to meet on the screen there in front of you.
[time=1263] But that starts on June 9th for our summer women's Bible study. Don't miss that opportunity.
[time=1269] We'll also tell you about this summer we're doing vacation Bible school.
[time=1274] It starts in July and we're grateful for all that's going to represent.
[time=1280] We need volunteers, people from our community coming together, having this opportunity to get their kids blessed during the summer time.
[time=1287] It's something that we are uniquely and terribly excited about.
[time=1291] So VBS coming up International Spy Academy this summer at Black Tech Ministries.
[time=1297] They're going to meet in the evenings in July.
[time=1300] Like I said, it's a great opportunity for you to come and be a part.
[time=1303] They need help by way of volunteers. They need help in all kinds of different respects.
[time=1308] And we would just love to serve you in that way even as well.
[time=1312] So keep that on your calendars. VBS late this summer at Black Tech Market Calendars and come ready for that this morning.
[time=1322] You're going to hear in just a minute from Randy Opelger and a powerful testimony this morning of the gospel.
[time=1329] And the transferring power the gospel has the policies of the gospel is the power of God that has the ability to change things.
[time=1336] And she is a personal testimony to its power.
[time=1340] And I'll talk a little bit this morning about the generosity of God. God's incredible, creative, generous provision and how we're called to join Him in that.
[time=1351] As we often do, also I wanted to give you an opportunity to contribute and donate to this program so it's broadcast so it's reach can be extended through the Founders Club.
[time=1361] This program has been sustained over the years, not by large donations but by little small donations from faithful, consistent, many years of watching.
[time=1371] So we invite you to be part of the Founders Club. It's a monthly opportunity for you to contribute to this ministry so the Bible Hour can continue and be a part of your lives on Sunday morning.
[time=1382] Thank you for watching. Thank you for being part of our family. We're excited about what God is doing in our community.
[time=1387] We're grateful. We are celebrating with Him and with you at all that's in store.
[time=1392] Thanks for watching. I appreciate it. God bless.
[time=1396] My second grade teacher, Mrs. Chadwick, was relaying with vivid detail the suffering of Jesus at Calvary on my behalf.
[time=1408] When heads were bowed and eyes were closed, the opportunity was given to claim Jesus as Savior.
[time=1415] The Holy Spirit stirred my heart of stone and my hand shot up.
[time=1420] To this day, my parents testify. I came home a different girl.
[time=1425] My stubborn, non-smiling, bad attitude was mostly gone and it was evident to them God had breathed his life into my soul.
[time=1436] And because I'm still following Jesus today, I believe that moment truly was the moment God made me His child.
[time=1446] O drum me, Lord. O drum me, Lord. O drum me, Lord. O drum me, Lord.
[time=1493] [MUSIC]
[time=1498] There's only one other moment in my life
[time=1506] that stands out above all the others.
[time=1509] And it's just as meaningful to me as that miraculous day in second grade.
[time=1514] I was 26 years old and sitting at Casa restaurant on Stellhorn, sharing a raspberry chicken salad with another mom from our church.
[time=1523] I had asked her to dinner because I wanted to pep her with questions about how to be a good mom.
[time=1529] I don't remember much of the conversation because it pales in comparison to the real reason God had brought me to that dinner table.
[time=1538] I remember clear as day, her getting choked up and teary-eyed as she talked about the treasure of redemption.
[time=1545] I had taken her to dinner to pep her with questions and ask her for parenting advice.
[time=1551] And she connected the conversation to the gospel.
[time=1554] Not only that, she was clearly moved by it.
[time=1558] I realized right then and there she had something I didn't.
[time=1563] I had never once been moved to tears by the gospel.
[time=1567] I had left it clear back in second grade.
[time=1571] All these years I had known I was safe from the power of sin and death because of Jesus' victory.
[time=1580] But I tucked it away as information that was useful only for my salvation.
[time=1585] I had moved on to passionately living my life for God.
[time=1590] I wanted to obey.
[time=1592] I knew backwards and forwards all the verses in the Bible that told me what to do.
[time=1598] When I sang praise to God, I sang loudest on the lines that proclaimed what I would do for him and how I would obey him and the sacrifices I would make for him.
[time=1608] Those were the lyrics that really stirred up my passion and my emotion.
[time=1613] All the while, having absolutely no idea, I was living a life centered on me and my performance for God.
[time=1622] But my patience, Savior, new.
[time=1624] [MUSIC - 47 seconds]
[time=1686] And in his perfect timing, he brought me to see my filthy rags.
[time=1691] It was the kindness of God that led me to repent of my self-attoning, self-centered efforts.
[time=1697] And as the dear older mom faithfully discipled me over the next two years, it was her compelling life and words that trained me to see how the gospel functions in every aspect of my life.
[time=1712] The Holy Spirit patiently instructed my heart and magnified Jesus in a way that radically changed my life.
[time=1720] The outward behavior is all the same.
[time=1723] All the years of training and obedience weren't wasted praise God, but he has radically changed me on the inside.
[time=1732] My motivation for obedience is the beauty of redemption, the beauty of Jesus.
[time=1738] And his name and praise is ever on my mind and lips.
[time=1743] I know full well Jesus is maintaining my right standing before God every moment of every day.
[time=1750] And I'm just as much in need of his victorious work at Calvary today as I was the day he first stirred me to believe our God saves.
[time=1760] Hosanna.
[time=1761] [MUSIC - 22 seconds]
[time=1802] Here's the big idea for today.
[time=1805] In light of what Mark shared with us, in light of my comments a minute ago, here's the big idea, here's the takeaway for today.
[time=1812] God's abundance provision in and engagement with creation
[time=1818] invites us to join in cheerful sacrificial generosity.
[time=1829] I wanted to come at today a little differently.
[time=1831] We always talk about 2 Corinthians 9 and we should, but I wanted to just put God on display this morning and maybe invite you to respond to him.
[time=1842] Look at the first two verses of Psalm 104, then I want to show you a picture that I've been obsessed with all week.
[time=1848] Psalm 104, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, O Lord my God,
[time=1857] you are very great.
[time=1861] You are clothed with splendor and majesty, covering yourself with light as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent." The picture you're about to see on the screens in front of you is of a star cluster called Omega Centauri in the upper right corner of a constellation called Centaurus.
[time=1886] This picture is 16,000 light years away from Earth
[time=1892] and you can't see it obviously with your naked eye.
[time=1896] In fact, this picture was taken six years ago and as far as I know, nobody until that point had ever seen anything like this.
[time=1903] There are a hundred thousand stars friends in this one picture.
[time=1909] You can see the scale on the frame before you that this picture from side to side itself is six light years wide.
[time=1919] That's one corner of one star cluster,
[time=1925] there are hundreds in the Milky Way galaxy, one corner of one cluster in one constellation in one place, 100,000 stars in all those various colors.
[time=1937] Why?
[time=1942] Our friends, Carl Sagan, said that if we're all alone in the universe, it seems like an awful waste of space.
[time=1952] Respectfully to Carl, I would say, oh Lord my God, you are very great because nobody had seen that but for six years ago,
[time=1967] that was always there and now I get to look at it.
[time=1973] It's incredible.
[time=1974] Stretching out the heavens like a tent.
[time=1978] This psalm friends is an invitation to see God in this creative generosity.
[time=1986] He didn't have to do that.
[time=1987] He could have made a couple of them.
[time=1989] He could line those stars up like a light bright, saying, remember those light brights?
[time=1996] Kids, remember, you know what a light bright is?
[time=1997] Kids, you do?
[time=1998] All right.
[time=2000] Got to the line up and said, Jesus loves you with a light bright, like the stars.
[time=2003] He could do that, right?
[time=2006] But he asks you and me to do it.
[time=2011] We are his ambassadors.
[time=2014] We are the ones who have been sent out on his behalf to join him in this creative generosity.
[time=2022] If I am miserly with my resources, if I am closed, if I white knuckle the things that God's given me, I don't join him in this.
[time=2034] Look at that.
[time=2036] That's not necessary.
[time=2037] And there it is.
[time=2040] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh Lord, my God,
[time=2046] you are very great.
[time=2049] You are clothed in splendor and majesty, covering yourself with light as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent.
[time=2058] Look at verse three.
[time=2059] He lays the beams of his chambers on the waters.
[time=2065] He makes his clouds, his chariot.
[time=2067] He rides on the wings of the wind.
[time=2070] Can we go back to that picture of the stars for one second?
[time=2073] The new living translation in verse two says, "You stretch out the starry curtain of the heavens." Isn't that beautiful?
[time=2084] You stretch out the starry curtain of the heavens.
[time=2087] Just because, because you can.
[time=2092] The heavens declare the glory of God.
[time=2094] That's why they're there.
[time=2098] And when we join him in generosity, we're plugged in to godliness.
[time=2104] That's what God wants from us.
[time=2106] Verse four, he makes his messengers wins, his ministers a flaming fire.
[time=2112] He set the earth on its foundations that it should never be moved.
[time=2117] Everything that's coming in this Psalm, friends, out of verses one and two, is all an illustration of his greatness.
[time=2123] The winds, the waters, the stars, the oceans.
[time=2127] You covered it with the deep, verse six, as with the garments, the waters stood above the mountains.
[time=2135] At your rebuke, they fled.
[time=2139] I love it that God can rebuke the water like a child.
[time=2142] Enough.
[time=2144] That's exactly what Jesus does in Mark chapter four, by the way, he says, "Peace, be still." And that's not really the language in the original.
[time=2150] It's more like, "Hey, knock it off." And they do.
[time=2155] They rebukes the waters.
[time=2157] And when I rebuke my kids, I don't say, "Now, now." You know, it's more forceful than that.
[time=2162] Maybe you're differently different than I am.
[time=2165] The mountains rose, the valleys sank down to the place that you appointed for them.
[time=2170] If you are inclined to mark in your Bibles, I might encourage you to mark all the pronouns in these, there's a lot of them, you, you're.
[time=2181] Or maybe just take note, put a little dot by him, something, I just can't get over it.
[time=2187] All the things that he does, my friend Josh Rang calls these declaratives, things that God has done or what God is like.
[time=2197] And he invites us to respond to the ways that he is, to what he is like, what's been declared about him.
[time=2204] You make springs, verse 10, gush forth in the valleys, they flow between the hills.
[time=2210] They give drink to every beast of the field, the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
[time=2216] Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell, they sing among the branches.
[time=2219] From your lofty abode, you water the mountains.
[time=2223] The earth is satisfied with the fruit of your work.
[time=2226] You cause the grass to grow for the livestock, aren't you glad Rick?
[time=2230] And plants for man to cultivate, that he may bring forth food from the earth, wine to gladden the heart of man, oil to make his face shine, bread to strengthen man's heart.
[time=2243] The trees of the Lord, verse 16 are watered abundantly, the cedars of Lebanon, that he planted.
[time=2251] The cedars of Lebanon are famous, they've been famous for thousands of years.
[time=2259] There's one of them.
[time=2260] Can you see a little person down in the lower part of that picture?
[time=2263] I can't point it to you because it's a long ways away for me, but can you see people in the bottom of that picture?
[time=2267] If you can, would you respond in some way?
[time=2270] Okay, that's a pretty big tree.
[time=2271] They grow up to be 130 feet tall.
[time=2275] Their trunks can be eight feet wide.
[time=2277] The ancient Phoenicians use them to build their ships, their temples, their palaces, their houses.
[time=2282] The Egyptians use their resin in mummification.
[time=2286] In the ancient creation epic of Gilgamesh, the cedars of Lebanon were the abode of the gods.
[time=2292] The gods lived in these forests.
[time=2294] They're often called the cedars of God, in fact.
[time=2297] The prophet Isaiah used them as a metaphor for the prior of the world.
[time=2301] It says in verse 13 of chapter two that they are lofty and lifted up.
[time=2305] It's not hard to see why.
[time=2307] They were used in the building of Solomon's temple.
[time=2310] They're mentioned 75 times in the Bible.
[time=2313] God planted them.
[time=2316] God's responsible for them.
[time=2319] He didn't have to do that.
[time=2321] That's a really amazing tree.
[time=2323] You've been out to California, some of you, and seen the redwoods.
[time=2328] Does your mouth fall open?
[time=2330] Why God?
[time=2331] He didn't have to do that.
[time=2334] You can drive a car through one of them.
[time=2335] You can see in that picture.
[time=2339] Consider Psalm 29.
[time=2341] The voice of the Lord is over the waters.
[time=2343] The God of the glory thunders, the Lord over many waters.
[time=2346] The voice of the Lord is powerful.
[time=2348] The voice of the Lord's full of majesty.
[time=2350] The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars.
[time=2352] The Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon.
[time=2354] God is very great.
[time=2357] God is very generous.
[time=2360] Those cedars, by the way, are in danger.
[time=2362] They've done a lot of work recently to kind of get them back.
[time=2368] The symbols of pride and arrogance from time immemorial are nothing to him.
[time=2373] He shatters them with his voice.
[time=2377] They don't have to do anything, just with his voice.
[time=2379] They're done, like twigs.
[time=2381] You know, the power of a tornado, like a freight train.
[time=2387] Tons like people say that, they come in through like a freight train, and these marvelous shows of power where they're just broken, like trees broken into like a twig.
[time=2397] Well, God just says something, and the cedars of Lebanon just snap, like a toothpick.
[time=2402] He's great.
[time=2403] Back to Psalm 104, verse 17.
[time=2406] In them, the birds build their nests.
[time=2410] The stork has her home in the fir trees.
[time=2412] The high mountains are for the wild goats.
[time=2414] The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.
[time=2417] He made the moon to mark the seasons.
[time=2419] The sun knows it's time for setting.
[time=2421] The sun knows, it's time.
[time=2425] Like he'd sing to your kids.
[time=2427] Good night moon.
[time=2431] It just, they know, 'cause God tells them.
[time=2436] He turns the earth.
[time=2437] You make darkness, it's night.
[time=2439] When all the beasts of the forest creep about.
[time=2441] The young lions roar for their prey, seeking their food from God.
[time=2447] When the sun rises, they steal away and lie down on their dens.
[time=2451] Man goes out to his work, to his labor, until the evening.
[time=2455] Here's the first point in your notes.
[time=2458] It's an observation of God's greatness in his provision.
[time=2463] God's greatness in his provision.
[time=2467] I mentioned a miser earlier in the service, and I say to you profoundly this morning, that God is not Ebenezer's Scrooge.
[time=2476] He's not hoarding his resources.
[time=2482] He's not hiding them away and not sharing them with others.
[time=2487] We are right to condemn Scrooge, and the story Dickens wants you to, to condemn Scrooge for not being a sharing person.
[time=2495] God's not like that.
[time=2499] God has given, and he's given, and he's given again as the song says.
[time=2503] So when we don't, when we aren't,
[time=2511] we are disconnected from him, I think in very profound ways.
[time=2515] This song is a song of celebration that the specificity and the beauty and the goodness of God's creative provision.
[time=2522] How could we disagree with him?
[time=2525] How could we not join him in caring for and being generous toward his work, making that greatness of his known in all the earth in this town?
[time=2534] How could we hoard the good things he's given us when there's so much need around us all the time?
[time=2542] I spent some time at the rescue mission with some students this past week, just downtown.
[time=2546] The need is incredibly great.
[time=2548] There are over 2,000 homeless people in this city.
[time=2551] 2,000 at any given time.
[time=2555] How can we ignore the needs around us?
[time=2559] There's, this place has needs, friends, and they're real needs.
[time=2567] Last Saturday morning, took a couple of hours to make our city more beautiful.
[time=2570] I think that makes much of God when we do stuff like that.
[time=2571] I do.
[time=2573] If I didn't believe and I saw my friends and neighbors picking up trash on the side of the road, I would be compelled to say, what's what are you doing that for?
[time=2579] Why are you here?
[time=2580] I would earn the right to tell them about Jesus as their unashamed series put forward.
[time=2587] The Psalmist makes his point in the first verse and sets to work illustrating it.
[time=2594] Oh, Lord, my God, you are very great.
[time=2599] I don't know if there exists life anywhere else in the universe, but God seems uniquely interested in this world, uniquely.
[time=2608] He has indeed made everything.
[time=2611] And then it's just 131.
[time=2612] It says God saw everything that he had made and behold, it was very good.
[time=2619] And there was evening and there was morning the sixth day.
[time=2622] This entire Psalm is like a commentary on that verse.
[time=2626] Yeah, it is very good.
[time=2627] Here's how good, real good.
[time=2630] Heavens, the clouds, the water, the wind, they all speak his control, his power, his generosity.
[time=2636] There are whispers everywhere.
[time=2637] There are shouts everywhere.
[time=2640] Perhaps all these things serve to comment on our own powerlessness, our own dependence.
[time=2646] Even the incomparable and beloved Curtis Smith just reacts to what he sees in the weather.
[time=2652] He can call off school, but he can't control it.
[time=2658] He is responding to God making the atmosphere move around.
[time=2662] And he reacts and our kids love him.
[time=2667] (congregation laughing) And they should.
[time=2669] Psalm 104, let's jump back into verse 24, friends.
[time=2673] Verse 24, this is the second point in your outline.
[time=2676] God's engagement in his creation.
[time=2678] God's engagement.
[time=2680] Yeah, God's made this incredible things, but he didn't just make it, then kind of set it loose.
[time=2685] And yeah, that's great.
[time=2686] I'll take a nap now.
[time=2687] He is engaged in his creation.
[time=2690] It's a model.
[time=2693] Oh Lord, how manifold are your works?
[time=2696] The new living says, oh Lord, what a variety of things you've made.
[time=2699] In wisdom, you made them all.
[time=2702] The earth is full of your creatures.
[time=2704] The world exists.
[time=2706] This is what Robert Ferrer Capon said.
[time=2708] It's a marvelous quote.
[time=2711] The world exists not for what it means, but for what it is.
[time=2716] The purpose of mushrooms to be mushrooms.
[time=2719] Wine to be wine.
[time=2721] Things are precious before they are contributory.
[time=2724] Before they are useful, if you will.
[time=2729] It's a false piety that walks through creation, looking only for lessons which can be applied somewhere else.
[time=2735] To be sure, God remains the greatest good.
[time=2737] But for all that, the world is still good in itself.
[time=2740] Indeed, since he does not need it, its whole reason for being must lie in its own goodness.
[time=2747] He has no use for it, only delight.
[time=2751] And he has friends, forgive me.
[time=2757] He doesn't need me or you, but he delights when I respond to him in the right way.
[time=2765] And I think all of creation, God doesn't create anything because he needs anything, but because he wants it to all join in his manifest greatness.
[time=2773] That's why he made the world.
[time=2777] For God has existed from the foundation of the world and before it, in perfect community with himself as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[time=2785] And he creates the universe out of an overflow of his own wonder and greatness and allows you and I to join in that.
[time=2795] And the world bears witness of it.
[time=2797] Isn't that marvelous?
[time=2800] Verse 25, Psalm 104, here is the sea great and wide which teems with creatures innumerable, living things both small and great.
[time=2812] This is the Atlantic Ocean.
[time=2814] I use the closest one to us.
[time=2815] There's a bigger one, as you know, called the Pacific Ocean.
[time=2819] This is 20% of the earth's surface.
[time=2824] 41 million square miles.
[time=2828] At its deepest, it's over five miles deep somewhere near Puerto Rico.
[time=2833] In 1999, after rowing for 81 days and 2,962 miles,
[time=2839] Tory Merton became the first woman to cross the Atlantic by rowboat when she reached Guadalupe from the Canary Islands.
[time=2849] It took her 81 days to row across it.
[time=2854] There's the sea great and wide, innumerable creatures teeming there.
[time=2864] Psalm 104, six through eight.
[time=2866] Let's go back and look at that real quick.
[time=2868] You covered it with the deep as with the garment, the water stood above the mountains.
[time=2872] At your rebuke, they fled.
[time=2874] The sound of your thunder, they took the flight.
[time=2877] God sets these things all in their places.
[time=2883] The Atlantic Ocean, even it is a witness to his greatness.
[time=2888] There's the sea.
[time=2889] Look at verse 26 of Psalm 104.
[time=2894] Psalm 104, verse 26.
[time=2895] There go the ships and the viethin, which you formed to play in it.
[time=2899] He just made it so it could have some more to play.
[time=2903] These I look to you.
[time=2907] These all look to you to give them their food and do season.
[time=2913] They all look to him.
[time=2916] He is attentive.
[time=2917] He is generous.
[time=2918] He is engaged with his creation.
[time=2920] He wants me to be engaged too.
[time=2924] To be generous too.
[time=2925] To be attentive.
[time=2927] When you give it, verse 28, when you give it to them, they gather it up.
[time=2932] When you open your hand, when you open your hand.
[time=2935] Underline that phrase in your Bibles if you would please.
[time=2939] When you open your hand, they are filled with good things.
[time=2944] Don't close your hand today.
[time=2948] Don't white knuckle the things that God's given.
[time=2952] Open your hands like his hands are open.
[time=2955] When you hide your face, they are dismayed.
[time=2961] When you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.
[time=2964] When you send forth your spirit, they're created and you renew the face of the ground.
[time=2969] Summer and winter and springtime and harvest.
[time=2974] The psalmist credits the Lord with the new life we hear all around us, the birds.
[time=2981] I heard singing in my windows yesterday.
[time=2983] They wake up from their sleep and they sing songs to him.
[time=2990] May the glory of the Lord endure forever.
[time=2995] Verse 31, "May the Lord rejoice in his works, who looks on the earth and it trembles to touches the mountains and they smoke.
[time=3004] I will sing to the Lord as long as I live.
[time=3008] I will sing praise to my God while I have being.
[time=3012] May my meditation be pleasing to him for I rejoice in the Lord.
[time=3015] Let sinners be consumed from the earth.
[time=3017] Let the wicked be no more.
[time=3019] Blessed the Lord, O my soul.
[time=3023] Hallelujah.
[time=3025] Praise the Lord.
[time=3026] The third point and final point in your notes today is what God wants, what God wants.
[time=3034] And I'll take you back to Psalm 50 this morning.
[time=3038] You know these words, whether you realize it or not
[time=3045] from Psalm 50.
[time=3046] Psalm 50 is a courtroom scene, a cosmic courtroom scene.
[time=3051] And God's bringing a case against his people.
[time=3055] It's pretty scary.
[time=3056] Here, O my people, and I will speak, Psalm 50 verse seven.
[time=3063] Psalm 50 verse seven.
[time=3067] Here, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, I will testify against you, I am God, your God.
[time=3075] I don't think that, that doesn't give me a lot of comfort to hear those words.
[time=3080] I have a case against you and I'm God.
[time=3084] That would make me pretty nervous.
[time=3086] God brings his case against his people and their lack of connection to him and his creative generosity and engagement.
[time=3097] Watch, not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you.
[time=3101] Your burnt offerings are always before me.
[time=3103] I will not accept a bull from your house or gulch from your folds.
[time=3110] Why?
[time=3112] Every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills.
[time=3116] I know all the birds of the hills and all that moves in the field is mine.
[time=3123] If I were hungry, I wouldn't tell you for the world and its fullness are mine.
[time=3131] God is God and doesn't need anything.
[time=3135] Patty asked me this morning, what does it mean in under compulsion?
[time=3138] What does that mean?
[time=3140] It means giving because you have to.
[time=3142] There is no arm behind your back this morning from the word of God.
[time=3146] He says, be cheerful as you give in response to God's greatness and provision and generosity and engagement.
[time=3155] I forgot to mention the takeaway from number two there.
[time=3160] It's from the song we're gonna sing in a minute here.
[time=3161] Join with all nature and manifold witness.
[time=3164] Can you hear it in your mind?
[time=3166] Join with all nature and manifold witness.
[time=3169] You're gonna sing that just a second.
[time=3170] In fact, the band, which comes back up, is the band coming back up this morning?
[time=3174] There they come.
[time=3175] Join with all nature and manifold witness.
[time=3179] That's the takeaway for number two.
[time=3180] The third one of course is what God wants.
[time=3183] God has unlimited resources.
[time=3185] The cattle on a thousand hills.
[time=3187] We aren't doing God any favors when we offer ourselves to him.
[time=3190] So what does he want?
[time=3191] Verse 13, Psalm 50, do I eat the flesh of bulls, drink the blood of goats, offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving and perform your vows to the most high.
[time=3205] God wants us to handle our resource with open hands.
[time=3209] He wants us to take him and his word seriously.
[time=3212] That's the takeaway for number three.
[time=3213] Take him and his word seriously.
[time=3217] Perform your vows before him.
[time=3219] If we are thankful, then we will hang on loosely.
[time=3225] He will deliver us.
[time=3226] Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving
[time=3232] and perform your vows to the most high.
[time=3234] Call upon me in the day of trouble.
[time=3236] I will deliver you and you shall glorify me.
[time=3241] God is generous.
[time=3243] God is engaged and God desires our generosity and engagement as we take him and his word.
[time=3249] Seriously, let's stand and sing about God's great faithfulness and provision this morning as we go.
[time=3255] [MUSIC - 72 seconds]
[time=3338] ("Pomp and Circumstance")
[time=3372] [MUSIC - 49 seconds]
[time=3426] All I have needed I have had provided.
[time=3436] Pray His high faithfulness.
[time=3452] Lord unto me.
[time=3463] Amen is right.
[time=3465] Let's pray.
[time=3468] All we have needed.
[time=3471] Your hand has provided.
[time=3477] Your compassion's don't fail.
[time=3480] God I'm so grateful that they don't because I need them.
[time=3483] Your mercies are indeed new every morning.
[time=3487] Your faithfulness is great.
[time=3491] God I pray that you would continue to do a work in this body of believers, this church of generosity.
[time=3499] God certainly financial but God with time with whatever there is.
[time=3504] That we would be engaged in your work like you are.
[time=3509] And God we want to join you.
[time=3512] You're serious about what you have done.
[time=3514] You want us to be serious too to take our vows seriously.
[time=3518] So God may that be the case.
[time=3519] Maybe be generous and engaged God and serious as we keep our promises to you and to your work.
[time=3526] Thank you for this day.
[time=3527] Thank you for the service God and for the chance to sing and to give and to hear from you in your word.
[time=3532] I pray all these things with great thanksgiving in Jesus' name.
[time=3535] [AMEN] You
