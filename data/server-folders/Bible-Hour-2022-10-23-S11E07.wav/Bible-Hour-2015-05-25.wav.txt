[time=1136] The numbers are staggering and really like other things inside of the Christian world that can become overwhelming. And yet when you think about it, we don't want to be sentimental about it. We want to be objective and factual about it. It's easy to become sentimental at some point regarding this. We could easily put more pictures and videos that could try to tug at your heart. That's not our goal this morning. We want to, again, just open God's Word to find out what he says about that.
[time=1165] But as we think about, again, the enormity of the problem, there might be somewhere in the ballpark. Again, you can find different numbers, but around 123,000 orphans in the United States today. That figure's probably low. Janice was, Janice Mariezy was here a few weeks ago. Maybe it was last week, and she got to talk to some of us, and she described how there are 3 million orphans in India.
[time=1193] We think about even a larger context of our world, and again, the numbers may be different depending on what website you look at or what area you look to, but there might be around 153 million orphans in the world.
[time=1210] And so it can be very overwhelming, and it certainly is a big issue in our world today. Children are orphaned and women are widowed for a whole host of reasons, right?
[time=1222] Sometimes it might be just pure abandonment. Sometimes there are financial reasons or causes. Sometimes there are just simply uncontrolled circumstances in life.
[time=1234] War or premature death or whatever kind of accident that there may be. Sometimes there's family pressure to give up a child.
[time=1245] But you think about the situation. What can you do? What can one person, what can one individual do?
[time=1253] It can become a bigger burden than any one person was meant to bear. It can become sometimes a source of guilt.
[time=1260] It can be, again, sentimentalism can wreak havoc. There is no clear action, though, commanded in Scripture.
[time=1268] And as much as we'd like, the idea of caring for widows and orphans, it's not black and white. There's nothing specifically from God's Word that says you must do this.
[time=1281] We like God to paint and find strokes, but many times it's more of a broad stroke. And so this morning I can't tell you anything specific about what you're supposed to do.
[time=1292] But I can remind you this morning of what God has done for you. And as God has put a call upon your heart, we can understand that there is a general call to do something in this space.
[time=1308] I don't know what it might look like for you. But my prayer this morning is that all of us would be attuned more to it and open to God's leading whatever that might look like.
[time=1319] So what can you do? I think you can do what's in your control and what God is placing on your heart.
[time=1326] And at the core of this is having a heart like God's heart and living a life of generosity towards widows and orphans that flows out of God's generosity towards you.
[time=1339] So let's dive in this morning and to help us navigate these waters we'll ask three questions this morning.
[time=1346] First, what does the Bible call us to regarding widows and orphans? Second, why are we called to care for widows and orphans?
[time=1353] Third, what is the Christian's motivation to care for widows and orphans? And let's pray real quick.
[time=1361] Father, we again just pause before you. God, we want to just remember again just the blanket statement that I can make that each and every one of us were orphaned spiritually.
[time=1380] Unable to change our situation without the power to do anything differently, and yet through your son and through the beauty of his work at Calvary, by your grace you have adopted many of us that have called us, that have called you our Father.
[time=1405] Through the work that you've done, and so this morning, God, we humbly just say thank you.
[time=1410] And we pray this morning that your spirit again would be active this morning in our hearts to help us understand personally and intimately what you would have each of us to do, and that we would not stand as judges over what other people might do in this space.
[time=1429] But between what you would call us to do, between you and between me, God, I pray that you'd work in my heart and the hearts of these individuals this morning to speak to us and lead us.
[time=1444] In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[time=1447] Well, what does the Bible call us to regarding widows and orphans?
[time=1452] First of all, there is a specific call to the church regarding widows.
[time=1457] That's in 1 Timothy 5.
[time=1460] And when we looked at that several months ago, we looked at two commands, and we're not going to spend time on that this morning, but those two commands are this, to honor widows who are truly widows indeed, and verse 16, to care for those who are truly widows.
[time=1475] Specifically, that's talking about the church body together that would follow the leadership of the elders and that the deacons will be able to minister to widows inside of the family that the church is a part of.
[time=1490] And yet that's not exactly what we're addressing this morning, what we're addressing this morning is a more general call, which speaks to authentic Christianity in the heart of an individual.
[time=1504] It speaks to every single one of us, not just a local body of people, but it speaks to you and me individually as to the authenticity of our faith in Christ.
[time=1517] And it comes in James chapter 1.
[time=1521] And I'm going to back up and start in verse 22 and read to the end of chapter 1.
[time=1526] It says this, "But be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourselves.
[time=1531] For if anyone is a here of the word and not a doer, he's like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror.
[time=1538] For he looks at himself and goes away and it once forgets what he is like.
[time=1545] But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty and perseveres being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in what he's doing.
[time=1556] If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless."
[time=1563] Verse 27, "Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father is this, to visit orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained from the world."
[time=1580] You see, what we see here is again a general call which speaks to all of us about the authenticity of our Christianity.
[time=1588] It's an idea of this that we are called here specifically to visit orphans and widows in their distress.
[time=1598] That word visit is a word that we need to look into for a minute.
[time=1602] Sometimes you can do a word study on a word that really doesn't open anything new up to you.
[time=1608] We kind of understand the basics of some ideas, but this is a word that I think would help us to do a word study that understands what the Greek says about this.
[time=1617] But also see where this word is used in other places because it's not used that often throughout the New Testament.
[time=1623] But the word visit sometimes translated care is a word that simply means to look upon or after.
[time=1632] It's the idea of you inspecting a situation, to examine a situation or a circumstance with your very own eyes.
[time=1643] And it carries with it an intention or a purpose.
[time=1648] It's not just to view a situation or a circumstance so that you know what's going on there.
[time=1654] That's part of it, but the second part is even more important.
[time=1658] It's to view or examine a circumstance or a situation that you can see or inspect with the purpose of you going in and helping or benefiting the situation.
[time=1672] It takes action. It's not just knowledge.
[time=1676] It's moving on that knowledge and actually taking some action for the benefit in this specific context.
[time=1686] It's looking in after widows and orphans with the purpose of wanting to benefit them, with the purpose of wanting to help them.
[time=1696] If you've ever just had a bad day or a bad week in your life, we've all probably been there, right?
[time=1703] And you have a friend who just calls or knocks on the door and comes in and just says,
[time=1710] "You know what? I just wanted to check on you to make sure that you're all right.
[time=1716] Can I do anything for you? Can I help?
[time=1720] Can I do?" Because again, you've been through this difficult situation and I'm concerned about you.
[time=1726] I want to look in after you and if there's anything that I can do for you, would you let me know?
[time=1735] You probably all had somebody do that for us, right?
[time=1738] That's the idea of this word to visit or to care for.
[time=1743] It's to look in after.
[time=1745] The Bible uses this same word only in a few other places.
[time=1749] It uses it in Hebrews, chapter 2, verse 6.
[time=1753] And the writer of Hebrews is actually quoting Psalm 8.
[time=1758] And he says this, "It's been testified somewhere," which is Psalm 8.
[time=1762] "This, what is man that you God are mindful of him or the son of man that you care for him or that you visit him?"
[time=1774] You see, Psalm 8 is somewhat of a prophetic Psalm of talking about the son of man, which is Jesus himself.
[time=1781] And so Hebrews is testifying to the work of Jesus that he was willing to leave heaven and earth,
[time=1788] to visit us, to examine our situation, to inspect the state of humanity, and then to actually do something about it.
[time=1800] That he would live a perfect life and go to the cross and die a death that he didn't deserve
[time=1806] so that he could benefit us and redeem us and then adopt us into his family.
[time=1812] You see, he's the one who has visited us.
[time=1815] He's the one who has shown care for us.
[time=1820] It's used in Luke chapter 1.
[time=1824] We don't have time to go there, but what a beautiful passage of Scripture went.
[time=1828] Zechariah, again, remember Zechariah was the father of John the Baptist.
[time=1834] And God had come to Zechariah and his wife and said, "You're going to have a baby," and he didn't believe, right?
[time=1839] And he went mute if you remember.
[time=1842] And then the very first words that came out of his mouth was this beautiful song of praise to God.
[time=1850] And when he does that in verse 67, he says this, "His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited
[time=1863] and redeemed his people and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David."
[time=1871] You see, there again, what he's saying there, he has visited us.
[time=1874] It's the very same word here that we're called to visit widows and orphans in their distress.
[time=1881] It's not just that God came down and said, "Oh, I see your situation.
[time=1886] Looks pretty dire.
[time=1889] I see you're in a desperate situation.
[time=1892] I'm going to head back up to heaven now. Good luck, right? No.
[time=1899] He came down, he examined, he saw our state. Obviously, he knew our state before he came.
[time=1904] He's completely sovereign. But when he came down and saw him, he actually acted for our good and for our benefit to help us in our affliction.
[time=1915] The greatest affliction that anyone could have.
[time=1919] Our sinful condition and our propensity to follow after our own ways.
[time=1926] Well, it says there to look into or to care for widows and orphans in their distress.
[time=1932] Distress is just a word that means tribulation. It means their circumstances, right?
[time=1938] You know, not every widow is in distress.
[time=1942] We saw that in 1 Timothy 5. Hopefully, there might be family members who are there.
[time=1946] But also in this day and time, there might be widows who are financially well off,
[time=1952] but they still might need some spiritual care.
[time=1955] They still might need some emotional help in those type of things.
[time=1959] But when you put all of this together, what does it look like?
[time=1963] What is God calling us to do in this general sense?
[time=1966] I think it's this. I think it's being aware of the issue.
[time=1970] The plight of widows and orphans. And then living a life of generosity.
[time=1976] Being willing to be generous with your dollars for sure sometimes.
[time=1981] Maybe that's not for everybody, but maybe willing to be generous with your time or with other resources. I think it again comes back to living below your means on a monthly basis. So that there's extra, so that when God put something on your heart, you're able to meet some of those needs.
[time=1999] It might be using an organization. So understanding what we try to do
[time=2005] as a local body here when we support as our own.
[time=2009] That you might be able to participate with us as we give money to as our own to help those in India.
[time=2017] That's part of this general call.
[time=2020] It may be sponsoring a child through Compassion International.
[time=2024] Maybe they have parents. Maybe they don't have parents.
[time=2027] But it's a, again, you're using an organization to be able to have obedience toward this general call to help widows and orphans.
[time=2036] It may be volunteering for a both hands project.
[time=2039] It may be instead of volunteering your time for a both hands project, it might mean financially giving to a both hands project.
[time=2049] Again, it might be specifically using your local church in the sense of visiting widows who attend Blackhawk or used to attend Blackhawk, but now they're shut in because they can't get out.
[time=2063] It might mean that you adopt a widow, that you ask the elders or the deacons or some of the church staff, is there a widow who used to come that my family could just simply adopt so that we could visit them once in a while?
[time=2075] I don't know what it is for you. I don't know.
[time=2079] But I know that we're all called to do something in response to what God has done for us.
[time=2086] It may be connecting with families who are adopting
[time=2092] and serving them in some capacity.
[time=2096] It might be being a safe family's host.
[time=2099] It might be taking a meal to a family who recently adopted.
[time=2102] It might be committing to support a family who recently adopted for a specific period of time.
[time=2110] It might be offering free babysitting to a family that recently adopted.
[time=2115] It might be visiting a local orphanage on a regular basis or visiting a nursing home.
[time=2123] My wife and my two daughters, on a regular occasion, they're homeschooled and so they have a lot of flexibility.
[time=2131] But once a month, I believe, they go to St. Anne's nursing home and just visit some of the widows that are there and they actually do their nails and they hang out with them and have a great time.
[time=2142] And when it's appropriate, they have conversations about their faith and encourage them in Christ.
[time=2148] It's just giving of time. It's something what does this not look like?
[time=2155] It doesn't look like every family having to adopt.
[time=2159] It doesn't look like everybody having to give money.
[time=2163] There's lots of different things that you can do to find obedience to this general call to care for widows and orphans.
[time=2174] So there's a specific call for the church to honor and care for widows who are truly widows indeed.
[time=2180] But there's a more general call which speaks to genuine Christianity in the heart of every Christ follower.
[time=2187] So it's what we're called to.
[time=2189] Secondly, why are we called to care for widows and orphans?
[time=2193] I believe there's probably lots of reasons here, but the one I would go to first is this, because God's heart is full of compassion for widows and orphans.
[time=2203] We can look to it in the Old Testament, just a few verses.
[time=2206] Psalm 68.5 says this, Father of the fatherless and protector of widows is God in His holy habitation.
[time=2214] Psalm 146.9, the Lord watches over the sojourners.
[time=2218] He upholds the widow and the fatherless.
[time=2222] In Deuteronomy chapter 24 specifically to the Israelites and how they conducted their lives in the country of Israel.
[time=2231] But it says this in Deuteronomy 24, when you reap your harvest in your field and forget a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it.
[time=2239] It shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless and the widow that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
[time=2246] When you beat your olive trees, you shall not go over them a second time.
[time=2250] It shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless and the widow.
[time=2254] When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not strip it afterward.
[time=2258] It shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless and the widow.
[time=2263] It's very clear throughout Scripture that there's a principle that God has a heart for widows and orphans.
[time=2268] But yet when you think about this, if this is true, then in my mind, maybe in your mind, it begs the question, why does God allow all of this then, right?
[time=2277] Why are there so many orphans?
[time=2280] And why are there so many widows who aren't being cared for?
[time=2285] I wish I had an answer for you.
[time=2289] I don't know.
[time=2291] But I do know that God knows their hurts.
[time=2296] He knows their name as the choir just saying.
[time=2301] And Jesus himself knows what it is like to be abandoned and without family
[time=2307] when his father turned his back at the cross.
[time=2312] Jesus can relate.
[time=2314] God is aware.
[time=2317] He's not aloof.
[time=2319] He is present in their afflictions, relating to them and in a very real sense,
[time=2325] suffering with them in their affliction.
[time=2330] Remember, when Saul came to know Christ on the road to Damascus
[time=2337] and the light came down and the voice from heaven said this, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?
[time=2347] Jesus had already been up in heaven.
[time=2349] How was he persecuting Jesus?
[time=2352] Because he was persecuting the people that Jesus cared for.
[time=2356] And in a very real sense, Jesus was relating to and being a part of that same suffering.
[time=2364] I believe he does that with widows and orphans in their distress as well.
[time=2371] So there's a general call which speaks to genuine Christianity in the heart of every Christ follower.
[time=2376] And this call to care for widows and orphans flows out of God's heart of compassion
[time=2382] that we saw in the Old Testament for widows and orphans.
[time=2385] The final question this morning is this.
[time=2387] What is the Christian motivation to care for widows and orphans?
[time=2393] I say Christian's motivation because there are a lot of people in an organization who are doing their best to help outside of the Christian community.
[time=2402] I understand that and I'm very thankful for all of their efforts.
[time=2406] And God's just general grace, not his salvific grace, but his general grace is a part of how he cares for them through some of those organizations.
[time=2416] But I also know that sometimes the motivation there may be different than what it is for Christians.
[time=2423] I know that guilt and fear and straight moralism and sometimes even idealism are terrible motivators.
[time=2436] You know, we know the right thing to do.
[time=2439] I don't need to be up here and telling you that we need to care for widows and orphans.
[time=2445] That's something that we need to do.
[time=2447] We're made in the image of God.
[time=2449] We know right from wrong.
[time=2450] We know what we're supposed to do.
[time=2452] We just don't do it naturally.
[time=2456] We need a power outside of ourselves to motivate us to do the things that God is calling us to do.
[time=2468] I believe there are two ways, probably more ways, but two ways to get motivation to care for widows and orphans.
[time=2476] Believe it or not, there are two declaratives in scriptures that we'll go to real quick.
[time=2481] I've talked about declaratives and imperatives a lot.
[time=2484] The imperatives are the command of Scripture.
[time=2486] They're necessary.
[time=2487] They're God's grace to us because they show us how life works best.
[time=2491] And yet you will rarely find a imperative, a command, far from a declarative, a truth about who God is and what He's done.
[time=2500] So let's look at two of them this morning.
[time=2502] Two ways to get motivation.
[time=2504] Motivation to care for widows and orphans comes from God's care for you.
[time=2510] We could go back to Deuteronomy 24.
[time=2512] Remember those commands that He gave to Israel to say, "Hey, when you're harvesting your land,
[time=2519] leave the sheep behind, when you're gaining the olive fruit, leave some behind,
[time=2525] and you're grabbing the grapes, leave some behind." This is what it says in the very next verse, verse 22.
[time=2531] "For you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt.
[time=2537] Therefore, I command you to do this." But currently in our context of James chapter 1 where we see this, verse 27, this general call to care for widows and orphans.
[time=2554] Our current context tells us the reason we do not do these things, the reason we don't obey,
[time=2561] the reason we are hearers and not doers is because we forget the beauty and the grace of Christ.
[time=2569] We look into what it says here in verse 25, the law of liberty.
[time=2574] What's that talking about?
[time=2577] The law of liberty is the grace of Christ.
[time=2583] Completely different from the law of the Old Testament, right, that brings condemnation.
[time=2589] The law of liberty, the perfect law, is the law of the grace of Christ that He would come into our lives
[time=2598] and show us our sinfulness and then give us the ability, through faith, to respond to His gracious offer of redeeming us and adopting us and then giving us then the grace to even obey those commands.
[time=2613] It's looking into the perfect law of liberty.
[time=2617] The reason we don't do these things is because we've forgotten.
[time=2625] We've forgotten the grace that He's extended to us.
[time=2631] And we go about our days and we think that we can handle it just fine by ourselves.
[time=2636] We go about our week and we try to do it in our own strength
[time=2642] instead of remembering.
[time=2646] Remembering that time when the very first time when God graciously humbled you
[time=2653] to show you your sin and to reveal the person and work of Christ to you,
[time=2660] let's not forget what He's done for us.
[time=2665] You see, the motivation to care for widows and orphans comes from His care for us.
[time=2674] Secondly, motivation to care for widows and orphans comes from God's promise to provide for you in your generosity.
[time=2683] This isn't specifically about widows and orphans, but I think it's a principle throughout Scripture.
[time=2688] In Philippians 4, Paul is talking to the people in Philippi
[time=2694] and graciously thanking them for the financial support that they were willing to give to Him.
[time=2701] And he says this, in verse 14 of Philippians 4, It was kind of you to share my trouble.
[time=2709] And you Philippians yourself know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving except you only.
[time=2719] Even in Thessalonica, you sent me help for my needs once and again.
[time=2723] Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit.
[time=2727] I've received full payment and more.
[time=2729] I'm well supplied.
[time=2731] Having received from a paphrodite is the gift you sent.
[time=2734] It was a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.
[time=2739] See what's going on there?
[time=2741] He's thanking them for their gift and reminding them that their gift financially was an act of worship to God.
[time=2748] But then he says this in conclusion.
[time=2751] In the midst of them, sacrificially giving, he says this,
[time=2758] And my God will supply every need of yours,
[time=2766] according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus, to our God and Father be glory forever and ever in men.
[time=2776] You see what he does there?
[time=2779] He reminds them again of the character and the truth of God our Father that would say when we're willing to be generous
[time=2790] and to give, even though we might not think we have the money or even though we might be fearful of where that might bring, we know that in the midst of that generosity that God will provide everything that we need,
[time=2808] richly according to Christ Jesus.
[time=2813] The motivation to care for widows and orphans comes from his generosity to us and the promise that he will provide for us.
[time=2825] Well in conclusion, you know again, the enormity of the problem, it is massive.
[time=2833] The numbers are staggering.
[time=2837] A quick word to those of you who have, maybe you're here this morning, maybe you're listening this morning, but through whatever circumstances, maybe you've given up a child, maybe you're on the flip side of what we're talking about this morning.
[time=2853] Just a quick word for you first.
[time=2855] There's no one in this room who can stand as judge over you.
[time=2861] Don't let people judge you.
[time=2864] Secondly, know that God cares for you as well.
[time=2870] His grace is sufficient enough to do whatever is needed in your specific situation.
[time=2877] Maybe you've had to give up a child recently.
[time=2880] Maybe it's been years, but God's grace is sufficient to care for you.
[time=2886] Maybe it's forgiveness, I don't know.
[time=2889] Maybe it's comfort, maybe it's support, maybe it's the courage to talk about it with someone for the first time.
[time=2897] This may be a hard Sunday for you, but it may also be exactly what God prescribed for you today.
[time=2907] Well, the goal of this morning, I might even say the goal of James in chapter 1, verse 27, or even back even further than that, the big author of Scripture, God's intention, is not to sentimentalize the issue.
[time=2921] It's not to guilt each of us into adopting a child or two, or even having a widow move in with every single family in our church family.
[time=2931] The goal is that each of us would walk away this morning reminded of God's great care for us when He visited us,
[time=2940] reminded of His promise to richly provide for us when we are generous,
[time=2946] and then to respond in some way, to His call to live generously in your efforts to care for widows and orphans.
[time=2958] Again, I don't know what this means for you.
[time=2962] It may be repenting that you haven't done anything before this point.
[time=2968] You know, repent is just a great word, it's a word that's not used anymore, but it simply means to do a 180-degree turn.
[time=2978] You were heading one direction in your disobedience, and now you go the complete opposite way into obedience.
[time=2986] This morning, I don't know, maybe you need to repent from the fact that this hasn't even been on your radar screen.
[time=2992] I don't know, that might be a great start for some of us.
[time=2996] Maybe it's adopting a child.
[time=2999] Again, I don't know, maybe God is stirring your heart and the Spirit is moving so that you would adopt.
[time=3006] Maybe it's opening up your finances and giving more on a monthly basis.
[time=3014] Maybe it's simply just doing some homework and finding out who the widows are in our church that you could maybe as a family adopt one or at least visit on occasion.
[time=3025] I don't know what it looks like, but I do know this, that if you are a Christian, then God has called you to care for widows and orphans in some way.
[time=3038] And you are to do this as an expression of His care for you and in the promise of His rich provision for you.
[time=3047] Let's pray. The choir can come back up and we'll finish this song.
[time=3051] God, thank you so much for the truth of your word.
[time=3055] Got it? It can be confusing sometimes.
[time=3060] Because there are so many voices and there are so many ways to think about certain issues in our world and yet you speak into them and my hope is that God, I have correctly communicated what you would want this morning
[time=3075] to bring clarity to this issue.
[time=3080] God, would you please just again in your spirit, would you use us in whatever ways that you want and would you help us to be quick to respond in obedience to whatever that call looks like for us individually
[time=3095] and for us in our own families?
[time=3098] God, thank you so much that you came to earth, you examined our situation
[time=3106] and then you did something about it.
[time=3110] You took the very sin that I have committed and will commit and will continue to commit upon your shoulders and you died the death that I deserve and that you gave me the perfect life that you lived
[time=3131] so that I could now be righteous before the Father to be adopted and treasured as your very own child.
[time=3142] Oh, thank you, Father.
[time=3145] Again, remind us that there is no one who loves us more or better than you
[time=3151] and there is no one who has done more for us or ever will come close to doing more for us than what you've done in Calvary.
[time=3165] God, we look forward to your return.
[time=3168] We can't wait for you to come and to claim your own and God, we know when we talk about that there will be a judgment.
[time=3175] I pray that you'd put on our hearts, God, a desire to share your gospel, the good news that Christ came and He died for sin.
[time=3185] God would that motivate us to live lives
[time=3191] in obedience to the prompting of your Holy Spirit who resides within us.
[time=3196] We pray this in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=3226] In Your mighty reign, when the oceans rise and thunders roar,
[time=3237] I will soar with you above the storm.
[time=3243] Father, You are King over the flood.
[time=3250] I will be still, know You, our God.
[time=3259] Find rest, my soul.
[time=3268] In Christ's love, know His come.
[time=3281] In quietness and trust,
[time=3287] when the oceans rise and thunders roar,
[time=3293] I will soar with You above the storm.
[time=3300] Father, You are King over the flood.
[time=3307] I will be still, know You, our God.
[time=3313] When the oceans rise and thunders roar,
[time=3320] I will soar with You above the storm.
[time=3327] Father, You are King over the flood.
[time=3333] I will be still, know You, our God.
[time=3364] Find rest, my soul.
[time=3371] In Christ's love, know His come.
[time=3384] In quietness and trust,
[time=3390] when the oceans rise and thunders roar,
[time=3396] I will soar with You above the storm.
[time=3403] Father, You are King over the flood.
[time=3410] I will be still, know You, our God.
[time=3417] When the oceans rise and thunders roar,
[time=3424] I will soar with You above the storm.
[time=3430] Father, You are King over the flood.
[time=3437] I will be still, know You, our God.
[time=3443] When the oceans rise and thunders roar,
[time=3450] I will soar with You above the storm.
[time=3457] Father, You are King over the flood.
[time=3463] I will be still, know You, our God.
[time=3493] I am not forgotten, I am not forgotten,
[time=3499] I am not forgotten, God knows my name, I am not forgotten, I am not forgotten, I am not forgotten, God knows my name, He knows my name.
[time=3522] He knows my name.
