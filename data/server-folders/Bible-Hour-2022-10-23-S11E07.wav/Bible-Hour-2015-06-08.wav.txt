[time=490] [MUSIC]

[time=727] [APPLAUSE]
[time=734] Well, good morning, everybody. Welcome to the Bible Hour. My name is Steve Webster. I'm a teaching pastor here at Blackhawk, and I'm so grateful that you're watching, and that you've been watching in some cases for many, many years.
[time=744] You've been a part of our family for that long. We have always, and we do this morning, feel like you are a part of our family. So thank you for watching. Thank you for being a part of what we have tried to do here by way of service to you for many, many years.
[time=759] I was thinking about the name, the Bible Hour, this morning, and that we can broadcast with great faithfulness or try to you by the grace of God what his word says week after week to you all across our region. And I just can't tell you how grateful I am to have been a little bit of a part of that, that we can faithfully proclaim what the word of God says to you with great compassion, with great conviction, week after week.
[time=785] So thanks for being a part of it. You're going to hear me talk this morning about a quote. The seed of the message was a quote from A.W. Tozer that what we think about when we think about God is the most important thing about us.
[time=797] And I think he's right. And so we'll talk about having a Jesus-shaped idea of God from Mark 1. I can't wait for you to hear it. I'm excited to have shared it with you this morning, and I'm looking forward to encouraging you hopefully in that way.
[time=812] You're also going to see this morning a little bit different group of cast of characters on the stage. I'm taking a team to Poland to join with and to assist the Ministry of Corbin and Tanya Miller who are working with an organization called Josiah Venture.
[time=827] Josiah Venture exists to help reach people in Eastern Europe and they do it in a whole number of different ways. Part of how they do it and what Corbin and Tanya and their family have gone to do, they've been there for almost two years now, hard to believe.
[time=839] What Corbin and Tanya have gone to do is to use their musical abilities to reach kids, teenagers, all over Eastern Europe. They put on camps. That's what we're going to do.
[time=850] We're leaving on June 22 to go for two weeks. We'll have a week of training and a week of a camp that we're going to do. We're going to be a part of almost 90 teenagers' lives to encourage them and to use music and really fun American songs, some Polish songs that we're still learning.
[time=866] We're going to use music as a vehicle to earn the right to tell them about Jesus and what he's done for them. So we're really excited about it. We've been working hard for months and we're leaving on the 22nd. I can't believe it's coming up really, really fast.
[time=881] Part of what we're going to do in that camp during the course of the two weeks that were there is lead and worship during the course of the camp a couple of different times during the week.
[time=890] And so you're going to see a whole bunch of students. There are six students going with me over to Poland. There's one graduate from Blackhawk this past year and five current students. You'll see most of them on the stage this morning. Some of them playing drums, playing guitar, playing the acoustic guitar.
[time=909] Brian Foster is going to lead us in that way, also some singers up front. So I'm really proud of these kids for taking a good block of their summer to go into serve in Eastern Europe. We're grateful for that grateful for the ministry of Corbett and Tonya. They were here for many, many years serving in this congregation and you undoubtedly know and remember them.
[time=928] Please pray for them. They have uprooted their family as I said earlier for almost two years to go and serve in this place and I am constantly amazed at what they've done in the short amount of time they've been there they've been unbelievably impactful.
[time=941] No surprise to us and no surprise to you. Please pray for them. Please pray for us as we go to assist them from June 22 to July 7.
[time=949] We're really excited to go. We've been getting ready, like I said, for a long, long time.
[time=955] Decide Venture has several different ministries. They've got Fusion, which is what we're going to go be part of. There's also going to be a local group of kids from Covenant College and Tennessee that are going to be working with the soccer ministry.
[time=966] So all the things that we're going to be involved for a couple weeks, we've been raising money for months and we're so grateful to this congregation for their generosity.
[time=973] We raised more money. Again, this morning they're going to be watching during the broadcast. So we're excited and we're excited to go in the Seacore, but I'm going to see his face in a few days and I can't even believe it.
[time=983] I've been talking to him over the computer for a long time. It would be nice to see him in person. So please pray for them. Again, please pray for us.
[time=991] Again, this morning what you're going to see by way of the broadcast is me talking about basically a question about what we think about when we think about God, but that's the most important thing about us.
[time=1000] So if I'm thinking about God, how should I think about him? The Bible is going to shape and order the way we think about a whole number of things.
[time=1008] And certainly our idea about God and who he is and what he's done is as A.W. Tozer said the most important thing about us.
[time=1016] So I'm grateful to share that with you this morning, to share my team with you this morning and all things that we prepare to do.
[time=1021] We're excited and we're grateful about what's going on here at Blackhawk and around the world.
[time=1027] If you've been watching the Bible Hour for some time and it's been a blessing to you, it's been an encouragement to you, we want to let you know about an opportunity to be a blessing to the Bible Hour by way of our Founders Club.
[time=1038] Founders Club is what it always has been, is made up of people that are giving faithfully and diligently week by week and very small denominations to support this ministry, to support the work going forward.
[time=1052] The Bible Hour is a ministry that wants to make God's Word known to the community, to be an encouragement in that way.
[time=1058] There's nothing so encouraging as knowing what it is that God has said and we want to faithfully communicate that and we're just going to need your help as we always have to do that.
[time=1067] The Founders Club is not made up again of large donors but several people who are faithfully giving in smaller amounts month after month to support this ministry.
[time=1077] So we invite you to consider that this morning as you've watched, as you've been watching for many years.
[time=1082] Thank you for watching this morning.
[time=1084] Thank you for being a part of our family.
[time=1086] We are so encouraged by you.
[time=1088] We call us, write us, let us know how you're doing and how we can be a further encouragement to you.
[time=1093] God bless you and have a great week.
[time=1097] [MUSIC]
[time=1179] This is my prayer in the battle, when triumph is still on its way.
[time=1188] I am a conqueror and co-air with Christ, so firm on His promise out there.
[time=1196] I will bring praise, I will bring praise.
[time=1200] No weapon formed against me shall remain.
[time=1204] I will rejoice, I will declare.
[time=1209] God is my victory and He is here.
[time=1215] [MUSIC]
[time=1321] This is my prayer in the harvest when favor and providence flow.
[time=1330] I know I'm filled to be emptied again.
[time=1336] This seed I've received I will sow.
[time=1344] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1348] Let's pray everybody.
[time=1352] All of my life in every season, you are still gone.
[time=1359] God, I have a reason to sing.
[time=1365] I have a reason to worship.
[time=1369] Father, I am confident that there are people within the sound of my voice in this room, wherever they are watching, who are in a great season, in the harvest,
[time=1380] in favor and providence flow, and they are rejoicing in you today.
[time=1384] I pray God that they would recognize that every good and perfect gift comes from you,
[time=1390] and they will give you praise for what they are enjoying today.
[time=1394] God, there are others in this room in the sound of my voice who are not in a season of harvest.
[time=1403] They are struggling.
[time=1407] And today, Father, I pray for them, you are still God, even in the lean, perhaps years, weeks, months.
[time=1420] We all have reason to sing.
[time=1426] So God, today I pray that your word would be an encouragement to those who are struggling to trust you
[time=1435] and God that those who are not struggling would have occasion to be thankful and to praise.
[time=1443] That is my prayer, Father, this morning I ask you to go before us.
[time=1447] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=1453] A.W. Tozer wrote a book called The Knowledge of the Holy.
[time=1459] And in that book is this rather well-known quote that is the seed for our talk together this morning.
[time=1470] Here's what he said.
[time=1472] And I'm going to encourage you to write it down in your bulletins.
[time=1477] There is an outline in there if you care to follow along.
[time=1481] He said, "What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us."
[time=1500] The quote continues.
[time=1502] The history of mankind will probably show that no people has ever risen above its religion.
[time=1509] And man's spiritual history will positively demonstrate that no religion has ever been greater than its idea of God.
[time=1519] That word idea is an important one.
[time=1521] Worship is pure.
[time=1523] It's lofty.
[time=1524] Or it's base.
[time=1525] It's low.
[time=1526] As the worshiper entertains high or low thoughts of God.
[time=1531] This morning I would invite you to consider this morning that we have prepared you today to have an appropriately high view
[time=1538] of God.
[time=1540] So what comes into your mind when you think about God this morning, I think in the order of our service,
[time=1546] we've prepared you.
[time=1548] That's why we sing songs in worship before we worship by hearing from God's word.
[time=1554] If our God is for us, then who could ever stop us?
[time=1559] Our God is greater.
[time=1561] Our God is stronger.
[time=1564] Our God is higher than any other.
[time=1566] So if that's what you believe about God, that should inform the way that you will face whatever you have to face tomorrow.
[time=1573] Or you don't really believe it.
[time=1576] You like the way it sounds, but don't actually believe that God is greater or you wouldn't speak to her that way.
[time=1584] Or him.
[time=1587] For this reason, the most serious question before the church he goes on is always God himself.
[time=1596] The most important fact about any person is not what he at a given time may say or do, but what he has in his deep heart conceived God to be like.
[time=1608] Hear me.
[time=1609] We tend by a secret law of the soul to move toward our mental image of God.
[time=1615] This is true not only of the individual Christian, but of the company of Christians that composes the church.
[time=1621] Always the most revealing thing about the church is her idea of God.
[time=1629] And so today, friends, I would invite you to write this down as well as we begin.
[time=1637] I invite you this morning to have a Jesus-shaped idea of God.
[time=1644] If you have any other conception of what God is actually like, you are disconnected from reality.
[time=1653] I can't say any planter than that.
[time=1655] It's impossible to overstate how significant Jesus coming to the earth was and is and shall be.
[time=1664] It's the most important thing that has ever happened or ever will happen.
[time=1670] So how could I overstate how significant that is?
[time=1674] What we think about when we think about God, says A.W. Tozer, is the most important thing about us.
[time=1680] I think he's right.
[time=1682] And I invite you this morning in this place as the church at Blackhawk to have your idea of God shaped by what his word says and by the person of his son, Jesus.
[time=1696] Any other conception of God is dangerous, it's faulty, and I want to reinforce this, am I saying it again?
[time=1703] It's unplugged from reality.
[time=1706] Christianity is an invitation, friends, to see things as Aleister McGrath would say as they really are.
[time=1714] That's very, very important. It's not my version of things or your version of things.
[time=1718] It's an invitation to see the world with clear eyes, like through the looking glass.
[time=1724] Aleister the looking glass, that's what Christianity is an invitation to.
[time=1728] In my apologetics classes at school, it's exactly how we talk about it.
[time=1732] An invitation to see the world in many ways, friends, for the first time.
[time=1737] Clearly, that's what we are calling you to today.
[time=1741] This fall, we're teaching a new class to freshmen on the essentials, on Christian essentials.
[time=1747] And here's how I would explain it to you.
[time=1749] There are six things that we've narrowed down that you really cannot simply hold loosely
[time=1755] and still call yourself a Christian, but here's how I would explain it to you.
[time=1758] It's not like you have to check six boxes, and then God says, "Hey, you have the right six answers.
[time=1763] You can come be on my team." This is how I would explain it.
[time=1766] If I was talking, or if you were talking to somebody in the phone, they said, "Hey, where are you?" They said, "Well, you know, I'm in this very flat, dry place." What's it like there? Well, it's very hot.
[time=1779] It's 110 degrees in the daytime. No shade.
[time=1783] What's the landscape? Well, there's sand everywhere, as far as the eye can see.
[time=1790] Very little vegetation, or anything green.
[time=1794] Okay, well, where are you then? And they would say Colorado.
[time=1800] That's not true.
[time=1802] They might think they're in Colorado, but what are they describing someplace else entirely?
[time=1807] That's what thinking rightly about God is like, friends.
[time=1810] Maybe you say, "Well, yes, I'm a Christian." And that's all well and good.
[time=1814] What's the landscape of your soul and your mind like?
[time=1819] If you are describing a different place, you are not what you think you are, and it's unkind and unloving for us to pretend like we can solely make up as we go.
[time=1829] That's not loving, and it's not kind.
[time=1833] So, one of those essentials is the divinity of Christ.
[time=1836] He's God, that Jesus is God.
[time=1840] And if we don't hold onto this very, very dearly and very, very carefully, I am fearful for the church at large if we lose hold of these things,
[time=1849] these right ideas about God, then we are letting all of it sit through our fingers.
[time=1854] The stakes are very high, friends.
[time=1857] Christianity is an historical faith, and by that I mean this, that Jesus came into the world at a certain time, in a certain place, for a certain reason, and we hold on tightly to things like Christmas and things like Easter.
[time=1874] These are the high points of our calendar year because they remember historical events, the birth of Jesus, the resurrection of Jesus.
[time=1882] Good Friday, you remember, his death, his passion on our behalf.
[time=1887] It's an historical faith and unplugging ourselves from those historical things that really did happen in time and space is extraordinarily dangerous.
[time=1896] And we are living in days and that seems like it's okay.
[time=1899] Like you can simply forget about these historical realities and still meaningfully call yourself a Christian.
[time=1904] I don't think that's true.
[time=1906] And I'll tell you why from the Scriptures this morning.
[time=1908] We'll be in the first chapter of Mark today.
[time=1911] And again, this morning we'll talk about what we think about when we think about God.
[time=1914] And my invitation to you this morning is to have a Jesus-shaped idea when you think about God.
[time=1920] If you have a different image of God in your mind, I would say, please consider what God's word says.
[time=1926] God's word says that he is the image of the invisible God.
[time=1931] I'll repeat that.
[time=1933] He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
[time=1937] By him, all things were created in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
[time=1942] That's Jesus.
[time=1944] So the Scriptures idea of God runs through that filter, Jesus.
[time=1951] In fact, in John's letters, he said this.
[time=1953] He said, here's why you can test the spirits.
[time=1956] The spirits from God are not.
[time=1957] Here's the test.
[time=1959] If they affirm that Jesus came in the flesh, it's from God.
[time=1962] If they don't, they're not.
[time=1965] Now what is John talking about?
[time=1967] Unless those historical realities are important.
[time=1971] If they aren't the bedrock, then what on earth is John after?
[time=1973] What's he talking about?
[time=1975] No other chapter of the Bible has captivated me more than this one.
[time=1980] And I don't know why.
[time=1982] I suppose you can't help what you love in that way.
[time=1985] But I've spent the better part of 20 years meditating on it.
[time=1989] And I will spend the rest of my life meditating on it.
[time=1992] The picture of Jesus in this chapter is extraordinary.
[time=1997] And many people in the room have taken a class from me in the gospel of Mark.
[time=2001] And my passion for it, again, the fact that it captivated me is no secret.
[time=2005] I wear my heart on my sleeve.
[time=2009] There are three observations in your outline for this morning from Mark chapter 1.
[time=2013] I'm just going to invite you to make these observations with me.
[time=2015] And by virtue of that, move through the rest of your week.
[time=2020] The application, I think, is clear at the outset.
[time=2023] If you identify yourself with Jesus, this is what you mean.
[time=2028] You have identified yourself with this person.
[time=2031] Who is this person?
[time=2033] Well, I'm glad you asked.
[time=2035] That's the most important question.
[time=2036] By the way, thank you for smiling, Casey.
[time=2038] It's been a few days.
[time=2042] I think the answer to that question, who's Jesus, is the most important question you could ever be asked.
[time=2049] I want to invite you to write that down, too.
[time=2052] There's that question, who's Jesus?
[time=2055] Now, who is Jesus to you?
[time=2057] Because that could be a number of different answers, couldn't it?
[time=2059] Who is he?
[time=2060] Really?
[time=2062] There were church councils that were held far and wide to answer that question.
[time=2067] You know, in fact, they doubted whether he was a man before they doubted whether he was God.
[time=2074] Isn't that interesting?
[time=2076] That's the lofty picture of Jesus that emerges from the first couple centuries after he appeared on the earth.
[time=2082] If you call yourself by Jesus' name, you've identified yourself with that person.
[time=2087] You have access to the God of the universe.
[time=2090] Please turn your Bibles to Ephesians chapter 2, just for a minute.
[time=2094] I just invite you this morning to take a minute just to open your scriptures and just to listen to this.
[time=2100] Listen to what is possible if you identify yourself with Jesus.
[time=2108] Ephesians chapter 2, starting in verse 11.
[time=2112] I was thinking about what we have access to if we identify ourselves with Jesus.
[time=2119] Therefore, remember verse 11, Ephesians 2, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, go eat popcorn.
[time=2126] If you need some help finding it. Therefore, remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh called the uncircumcision by what is called the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands.
[time=2137] Remember that you were at that time separated from Christ. That's the point. Separated from Christ.
[time=2143] Alienated from the commonwealth of Israel.
[time=2146] Strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
[time=2155] A more pitiful condition can hardly be imagined.
[time=2159] My friends, what is the first word of verse 13?
[time=2163] I couldn't hear you very well. But it's a beautiful word.
[time=2170] But now, in Christ Jesus, you who once were far off, have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
[time=2179] The studying of Christ's blood on the cross is a historical event.
[time=2182] All points back to you here in this letter and says, these things are true of you.
[time=2186] For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh
[time=2192] the dividing wall of hostility by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances
[time=2199] that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace.
[time=2206] There's more, verse 16, and might reconcile us both to God, Jews and Gentiles.
[time=2214] In one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility, and he came and he preached peace to you, who were far off, and peace to those who were near.
[time=2225] For through him we both have access in one spirit to the Father.
[time=2232] Access to the Father because of Jesus.
[time=2237] The death of hostility, it goes on to say that we are fellow citizens in the household of God that we are going to grow into a dwelling place for God.
[time=2247] All of this is possible because Jesus actually is who he said he was.
[time=2254] Rp, myself. All of that is possible because Jesus is who he said he was.
[time=2261] If all we had from Mark's gospel was the very first verse.
[time=2265] It's a startling statement on the identity of Jesus affirmed throughout the New Testament.
[time=2270] Look at verse 1 of Mark 1, I'll give you a second to turn back to the left there, the gospel of Mark, the very, very first verse.
[time=2278] I think it'll be on the screens behind me.
[time=2281] The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[time=2285] These are Mark's opening words about Jesus.
[time=2288] The first thing he says, right at the gate, this is John Mark writing the gospel of Mark.
[time=2293] John Mark was a traveling companion of Peter.
[time=2296] His name appears of course throughout the New Testament.
[time=2299] He may have been that young man that was there at the trial of Jesus and the arrest in the garden and ran away naked, remember that part?
[time=2305] And the gospels kind of tucked away at the end there.
[time=2307] He was around and he went on to be a very good friend of Peter and tradition says, very good tradition says, that Mark got his information about Jesus from Peter.
[time=2317] Who knew him better than anyone.
[time=2321] Jesus himself in Mark 14 claims to be the son of man who will sit at the right hand of power.
[time=2327] In my apologies class, we listen to a lot of talks because there's a lot of good apologists out there
[time=2333] and the Internet is full of good resources.
[time=2336] One of them is a guy named Nabil Kureshi, who's a converted Muslim to Christ
[time=2342] and who is now working with Robbie Zachariah's International Ministries.
[time=2345] And Nabil Kureshi talks about that verse in Mark 14 as being instrumental to him coming to Christ.
[time=2350] Because for Muslims, it's a very, very important question.
[time=2353] Who's Jesus?
[time=2354] Because they didn't believe that he died in the cross.
[time=2356] They didn't believe that he rose from the dead.
[time=2358] They didn't believe that he was God.
[time=2360] The most important things to believe about him are not shared by our Muslim friends.
[time=2365] And for him, he was overwhelmed by the evidence of what was before him regarding the person of Christ.
[time=2371] Mark 14 was important for him.
[time=2373] It's important for us.
[time=2375] The High Priest in Mark 14 responds to the charge or his statement about being the son of man
[time=2381] by tearing his robes and saying, "Blasphemy!
[time=2384] How dare you?" He knew what he was saying, what he was claiming to be, who he was claiming to be.
[time=2390] He claimed to be God.
[time=2392] Colossians 1-19 says this, "For in him Jesus, all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell."
[time=2402] I invite you to consider that verse the rest of the week.
[time=2405] Just think about that.
[time=2407] "For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell."
[time=2413] What a beautiful thing.
[time=2416] Colossians 2-9 says, "For in Christ," this is the new living translation.
[time=2420] I love the way it's worded here.
[time=2422] "For in Christ lives all the fullness of God in a human body."
[time=2429] Paul wrote that letter in the middle of the first century.
[time=2432] So he had very clear ideas about who Jesus was.
[time=2436] Hebrews 1-1 through 3 says this, "Long ago, at many times and many ways, God spoke to our
[time=2442] fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his son, whom he appointed the heir of all things."
[time=2453] He is the heir of all things is in the original language, all things.
[time=2460] That's everything.
[time=2461] There's nothing left after that.
[time=2463] There's everything and there's nothing left.
[time=2465] He's the heir of everything.
[time=2467] Who is he?
[time=2468] Who gets to be the heir of everything, God?
[time=2474] Through whom also he created the world.
[time=2477] He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature.
[time=2483] That verse is referring to a ring, a signet ring that you would put in wax to make your
[time=2489] signature, to make your seal.
[time=2491] He is the exact imprint of the nature of God.
[time=2495] He upholds the universe by the word of his power.
[time=2500] After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high.
[time=2505] The first point in your notes, friends, is that Jesus is the son of God.
[time=2509] And I think it's important for me to say, again, that we can't exaggerate about that.
[time=2515] We can't make too much of that.
[time=2517] His identity is a very, very big deal in the Bible if you actually take time to read it.
[time=2521] It's a very, very big deal.
[time=2523] He is the son of God, and that has extraordinarily great significance.
[time=2527] His appearance is good news.
[time=2530] That's also in Mark chapter 1 verse 1.
[time=2532] It's the gospel.
[time=2533] The gospel is good news.
[time=2534] If God's own son walks into history, that's good because he's come to save, to seek and
[time=2542] save those who were lost, like me, like you.
[time=2547] He is the Christ.
[time=2548] That's also in Mark 1 verse 1.
[time=2550] He's the Christ, the promised Messiah, who has come to do what no one else could do.
[time=2556] And in fact, he could do what no one else can do because he's God's son.
[time=2561] He's the unique son.
[time=2562] There's nobody like him.
[time=2563] There's no one like you, none like you.
[time=2567] That's why I'm playing drums, not singing.
[time=2573] Verse 2.
[time=2575] Mark 1.
[time=2576] written in Isaiah the prophet, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face who will prepare your way.
[time=2582] The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord.
[time=2586] Make his paths straight.
[time=2588] John has come to prepare the way, we'll meet him in the next verse.
[time=2592] The way of the Lord, not the Lord's messenger, or the Lord's servants, but the Lord himself."
[time=2599] Verse 4.
[time=2602] John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the
[time=2610] forgiveness of sins.
[time=2612] And all the country of Judea was, and all Jerusalem were going out to him and being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
[time=2619] John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey, public to disguise the taste.
[time=2628] He preached, verse 7, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than I.
[time=2635] The strap of whose sandals I am worthy, I am not worthy, to stoop down and untie.
[time=2642] I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
[time=2648] I've mentioned to you before that I find this astonishing.
[time=2652] That also where Jesus says, "Among those born of women there is no one greater than John the Baptist." Remember that verse?
[time=2659] Not in some way if you remember that verse.
[time=2662] John says in this verse that he's not even worthy to untie the shoes of Jesus.
[time=2671] In other words, to untie his shoes to wash his feet, to be the lowest household slave.
[time=2678] Who's Jesus?
[time=2679] How great is he if among those born of women there's no one greater than John, and he can't
[time=2686] even untie Jesus' shoes?
[time=2688] That's a pretty staggering statement about who Jesus is.
[time=2692] The people of Judea and Jerusalem remember the words of Malachi.
[time=2697] Malachi 3 and Malachi 4, that there's going to be this judgment that God's coming to his people.
[time=2703] He's going to come with fire.
[time=2704] They don't want to get burned up.
[time=2706] So they all stream out to the river Jordan.
[time=2708] They go across the Jordan to start again to come back across the Jordan to begin all over
[time=2716] again.
[time=2717] And they identify with John in that way.
[time=2721] The people of Judah and Jerusalem understand what's going up.
[time=2724] They want to be delivered.
[time=2725] And John says, "Hey, it's not me.
[time=2728] I'm not the one." Well, what are the first two words of John's message from Mark's gospel?
[time=2733] "After me." "After me." John wears a t-shirt and says, "I'm with him." That's his whole life is that way.
[time=2746] John is all over the first chapter of Mark's gospel.
[time=2749] He's almost invisible.
[time=2750] It's not even really about him at all.
[time=2753] Isn't that remarkable?
[time=2754] It's lovely.
[time=2755] His whole mission is to prepare the way for somebody else.
[time=2759] Listen to what John says.
[time=2761] John the Baptist says in John the Apostles' gospel.
[time=2763] This is John 1 verse 29.
[time=2767] The next day he saw that is John the Baptist saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world."
[time=2780] I've often noted on that verse that in the Old Testament sins would be covered.
[time=2786] The blood said the blood's covered.
[time=2788] That's not what it says in John 1.
[time=2791] This Lamb takes away the sin of the world.
[time=2795] I think that's really great.
[time=2797] This is he of whom I said, "After me comes a man who ranks before me." Because he was before me.
[time=2803] He's been around from the beginning.
[time=2807] I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water that he might be revealed to Israel.
[time=2814] And John bore witness, "I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him."
[time=2821] I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, "He on
[time=2827] whom you see the Spirit descend and remain." This is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.
[time=2831] And I have seen in board witness that this is the Son of God.
[time=2838] The second point in your outline is this.
[time=2840] He has come to be with us.
[time=2844] Not just that he's God's Son.
[time=2846] He is.
[time=2847] But that very unique divine Son has come to be with us.
[time=2854] Like if you know there's a Son of God, that's great.
[time=2856] But if it comes to your house, that's better.
[time=2860] Isn't it better?
[time=2864] Now comes the one John spoke of.
[time=2866] Look at, this is back in Mark chapter 1 verse 9.
[time=2868] Mark 1 verse 9.
[time=2870] In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
[time=2876] He doesn't need forgiveness.
[time=2880] He confesses no sins.
[time=2882] Do you notice that?
[time=2883] Everybody else does.
[time=2884] He doesn't.
[time=2886] He's baptized to identify himself with those who need forgiveness, but he doesn't need it himself.
[time=2894] And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
[time=2901] And a voice came from heaven.
[time=2903] You are my beloved Son.
[time=2907] With you I am well pleased.
[time=2913] I've long noticed that he hasn't done anything at this point.
[time=2917] He hasn't, he's committed no miracles.
[time=2920] He's no teaching.
[time=2922] Why does God love him?
[time=2924] Why is he pleased with him just because of who he is?
[time=2931] I pray that my children will always know that I love them because they are my children.
[time=2941] Not because they perform.
[time=2945] May our kids never doubt that from us, friends.
[time=2948] Never.
[time=2950] Jesus is loved by God because of who he is, because he is his son.
[time=2956] Lamentations chapter 3.
[time=2958] It's the long passage about his mercies are new every morning and his faithfulness is great.
[time=2962] This is in that passage.
[time=2963] Lamentations 3 verse 55 says this.
[time=2966] I called on your name, O Lord, from the depths of the pit.
[time=2970] You heard my plea.
[time=2972] Do not close your ear to my cry for help.
[time=2975] You came near when I called on you.
[time=2979] You said do not fear.
[time=2982] Another book by A.W.
[time=2983] Tozerry says this.
[time=2985] We need never shout across the spaces to an absent God.
[time=2989] He is nearer than our own soul, closer than our most secret thoughts.
[time=2995] Matthew 1, 23 says behold the virgins shall conceive and bear a son and they shall call
[time=3002] his name the manual, which means what?
[time=3007] God with us.
[time=3010] I think there is real power and just even saying that sometimes.
[time=3014] God with us.
[time=3020] His name.
[time=3025] The second point or outline again is that he has come to be with us.
[time=3028] The third point and final point in your outline is nothing will ever be the same.
[time=3035] Mark 1 verse 14 says this.
[time=3037] After John was arrested, the story of that is actually told later in Mark's gospel about what happens to John.
[time=3044] Jesus came to Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God and saying the time is fulfilled,
[time=3050] the kingdom of God is at hand, repent and believe in the gospel.
[time=3056] God's kingdom needs what?
[time=3059] What do kingdoms need?
[time=3062] I can't hear you.
[time=3064] A king.
[time=3066] So by saying God's kingdom is at hand, the podium right now is at hand.
[time=3070] It's close.
[time=3072] God's kingdom is drawn near to you.
[time=3074] You know why?
[time=3075] Because the king is here.
[time=3077] He is confessing to his brethren.
[time=3081] God's kingdom is here because I'm the king.
[time=3085] I'm the one who can sit in the throne of Israel.
[time=3089] He's the Messiah, the Savior.
[time=3092] That by the way is very good news for them and for us, I must say.
[time=3097] Look at Luke chapter 1 verse 76.
[time=3102] This would be a close second to my favorite passages of the New Testament.
[time=3105] I love this.
[time=3106] This is Zechariah's prayer about his son.
[time=3108] Oh, by the way, John the Baptist.
[time=3111] This is what Zechariah believes about his son John and what his son John will come to do.
[time=3118] Luke 1, 76.
[time=3120] And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness
[time=3132] of their sins because the tender mercy of our God whereby the sunrise shall visit us from
[time=3140] on high to give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death to guide our feet into
[time=3146] the way of peace.
[time=3147] I'll have my Poland team and the worship team come back up at this moment if we could as I close.
[time=3154] He's the sunrise.
[time=3158] Zechariah understands that Jesus coming is the end of the night time.
[time=3165] He marks all time by the appearance of Jesus.
[time=3171] The night is over.
[time=3173] The day is now here.
[time=3175] What a marvelous thing to consider.
[time=3177] Jesus God's son.
[time=3180] He's come to be with us.
[time=3182] Nothing will ever be the same.
[time=3184] I invite you, if you are called by his name, to consider how great that inheritance is this morning.
[time=3191] What you think about when you think about God is the most important thing about us.
[time=3212] You stood before creation.
[time=3219] Eternity in your hands.
[time=3226] And you spoke here into motion my soul now to stand.
[time=3240] And you stood before my failures.
[time=3247] And carried the cross from my same.
[time=3254] My sin weighed upon your shoulders my soul now to stand.
[time=3267] So what can I say?
[time=3274] And what can I do?
[time=3281] But offer this heart of God.
[time=3290] Completely to you.
[time=3298] So I walk upon salvation.
[time=3305] The spirit of life and me.
[time=3312] I'd like to declare your promise my soul now to stand.
[time=3325] So what can I say?
[time=3332] And what can I do?
[time=3339] But offer this heart of God.
[time=3347] Completely to you.
[time=3354] So what can I say?
[time=3361] And what can I do?
[time=3368] But offer this heart of God.
[time=3375] Completely to you.
[time=3392] So I'll stand with arms high and heart up and down.
[time=3399] In awe of the one who gave it all.
[time=3406] I'll stand my soul on to you surrendered all I am is yours.
[time=3420] So I'll stand with arms high and heart up and down.
[time=3428] In awe of the one who gave it all.
[time=3435] I'll stand my soul on to you surrendered all I am is yours.
[time=3449] So I'll stand with arms high and heart up and down.
[time=3457] In awe of the one who gave it all.
[time=3464] I'll stand my soul on to you surrendered all I am is yours.
[time=3478] So I'll stand with arms high and heart up and down.
[time=3486] In awe of the one who gave it all.
[time=3493] I'll stand my soul on to you surrendered all I am is yours.
[time=3507] Would you pray with me?
[time=3514] Lord, we love you and we just thank you for what you've done for us.
[time=3520] And Lord, I pray that throughout our week and really through the rest of our lives that we wouldn't remember what happened here on this stage but we would just constantly remember what you've done for us.
[time=3532] So Lord, we praise you and we thank you for what you've done.
[time=3534] [AMEN] [BLANK_AUDIO]
