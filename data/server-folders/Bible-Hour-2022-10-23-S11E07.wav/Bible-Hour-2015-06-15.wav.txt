[time=199] [MUSIC - 908 seconds]
[time=1117] >> Well, good morning again. My name is Josh Rang. I'm on the teaching team here at Black Hawk, and it's my privilege to open up the word for you this morning. And we're in the midst of a series where we as speakers kind of get to pick whatever we want to talk about from the Bible. And so you'll never guess what I want to talk about this morning, especially for those of you that know me well, right?
[time=1135] >> Yeah. So we're in Galatians this morning on the Gospel. And so if you have your Bibles turned to Galatians, I don't expect you to remember this and no one really would, but I spoke on Galatians chapter 1 in 2012. And so we're going to quick review some of that and then head into the end of Galatians 1 and into chapter 2. Really, it's just this idea of too good to be true.
[time=1159] You ever had a message or some news that on your first hearing, you just thought, no, that just can't be. It's just too good to be true.
[time=1169] And certainly that can be said about the Gospel sometimes. Your first hearing, it's just too good to be true. You mean it doesn't have anything to do with me or my performance or my earning some part of this. And that's exactly right.
[time=1185] The Gospel is the best news that you could ever receive, is that Christ has done it all. And I think that we would all believe that we understand the Gospel specifically regarding our salvation, that first day that we might have come to know the Lord.
[time=1201] And yet the amazing part of the Gospel is that it's true every day thereafter, that our right standing with God does not change any of the days that we walk with Him because it's all based upon the merits of Christ.
[time=1218] So every single day that I walk with Him, He delights in me, He loves me, He's for me. Not because of my performance good or bad that day, but because of the performance of Christ credited to me on my behalf.
[time=1235] So Galatians chapter 1, let's read verse 1 through 10 this morning, and then we're going to actually read some more in a minute. But here's what it says to get some background, to get a kind of a ramp running up to what we're going to talk about this morning, Paul, an apostle.
[time=1250] Not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead and all the brothers who were with me, to the churches of Galatia, grace to you in peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, to whom be the glory forever and ever amen.
[time=1273] I'm astonished, Paul says, that you are so quickly deserting Him who has called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel. Not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
[time=1289] But even if we, on our angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel, contrary to the one we preach to you, let Him be accursed. As we've said before, so now I say again, if anyone is preaching to you a gospel, contrary to the one you received, let Him be accursed.
[time=1307] Let's understand what's going on here at the beginning of Galatians and all throughout the book. Paul's message was this, that God calls people into a way of relating to Him, which is not based upon works, but solely and completely through the work of Christ.
[time=1325] We see it in verse 6. He says, I'm astonished or amazed that you're so quickly deserting Him who has called you into the grace of Christ. It's a personal, intentional and specific call by God to an individual to now relate to Him in a different way, a way that is based completely and solely upon the grace that is found in Jesus Christ.
[time=1352] You don't have to stumble into it. You don't have to question this as if it were your own idea. God, your Father, does not want you to relate to Him in a transactional performance-based way.
[time=1366] He wants you to relate to Him without worry, without fear, knowing that He delights in you this morning, regardless of your performance, because again, God is pleased with me because He's pleased with Jesus.
[time=1382] And understand this this morning, if it were not for the gospel, I could not, you could not relate to God in any other way than according to a system of works, a system of morality, and you and I would be striving to please a God who could not be pleased without anything but perfection on our parts.
[time=1406] And thus my attempt and your attempt at a moral life would, I think, lead to a miserable life here on earth, but also an eternity of justified wrath forever.
[time=1419] You know, in comparison, there's no greater message. All other good news pales in comparison to the message of the gospel. And yet what had happened in Galatia is this, there were Jewish leaders who had come to do battle with Paul's message that we just talked of.
[time=1435] These Jews wanted to combine their system of morality or works, the law coupled with tradition. They wanted to couple that with Christ's finished work at Calvary, saying that both of them were necessary in order to be made right with God.
[time=1453] 30 years prior to writing this letter, the churches at Galatia, there was no Calvary. And while God never intended for his people to relate to him in a works based fashion, it's exactly how the vast majority of them were living, their acceptance before God was based upon their obedience to his law in their minds.
[time=1472] And so these Jews were so entrenched in their tradition and this system of morality that they would not stand for a message which did not include some type of merit or effort or work on their behalf in order to receive acceptance before God for salvation and every day thereafter.
[time=1495] Just quickly, you know, there's nothing wrong with God's law. It was a good law. It was given for protection and guidance and wisdom.
[time=1503] And yet it's a part of God's common grace, that grace which is good for every single human, whether they've come to saving faith or not. But the law was never meant for salvific grace, grace that pertains to salvation in him.
[time=1517] So the Galatians had two messages being proclaimed to them, the true gospel message from Paul and the Judaizers message about works plus Christ.
[time=1528] You know, if reality, everyone would want Paul's message, right?
[time=1534] But there's a very real sense in the heart of all of us that were tempted to believe that the gospel is simply too good to be true.
[time=1545] Maybe it's okay for some, but if you know my life, it's just too good to be true.
[time=1551] And this leads us to our main passage this morning, back in Galatians, start in verse 11, the very next verse. He says this.
[time=1559] For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached to me is not man's gospel, for I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.
[time=1572] For you've heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the Church of God violently and tried to destroy it, and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people.
[time=1583] I was so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers.
[time=1588] But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace, when he was pleased to reveal his son to me in order that I might preach to him among the Gentiles,
[time=1600] I did not immediately consult with anyone.
[time=1603] Nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia and returned again to Damascus.
[time=1610] Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, remained with him fifteen days, but I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother.
[time=1621] And what I'm writing to you before God, I do not lie. Then I went into the regions of Syria and Solicia, and I was still unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
[time=1630] They were only hearing it said, "He who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy, and they glorified God because of me."
[time=1641] Then after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me.
[time=1648] I went up because of a revelation and set before them, though privately before those who seemed influential.
[time=1655] I set before them the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles in order to make sure I was not running or had not run in vain.
[time=1662] But even Titus who was with me was not forced to be circumcised, though he was a Greek, yet because of false brothers secretly brought in who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus so they might bring us back into slavery.
[time=1676] To them we did not yield in submission even for a moment so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you.
[time=1683] And from those who seemed to be influential, what they were makes no difference to me, God shows no partiality.
[time=1690] Those I say who seemed influential added nothing to me.
[time=1693] On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcision, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised, for he who worked through Peter, for his apostolic ministry to the circumcised, worked also through me for mine to the Gentiles.
[time=1709] And when James and Cephas and John who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.
[time=1724] Only they asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.
[time=1730] Everybody doing okay? Verse 11, this is God's word.
[time=1735] But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned.
[time=1740] For before certain men came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles, but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party.
[time=1750] And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.
[time=1757] But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all,
[time=1764] "If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?"
[time=1771] We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners, yet we know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=1780] So we also have believed in Christ Jesus in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law, no one will be justified.
[time=1792] But if in our endeavor to be justified in Christ, we too were found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sins? Certainly not.
[time=1800] For if I rebuild what I tore down, I prove myself to be a transgressor.
[time=1804] For through the law I died to the law so that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ.
[time=1811] It's no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
[time=1821] I do not nullify the grace of God. For if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.
[time=1831] God, thank you for your word this morning. Just quite simply, we need your help.
[time=1837] Would you please help us this morning to understand and to apply it to our lives for your glory and for your honor. Amen.
[time=1848] Two main points this morning is we look at this passage of Scripture.
[time=1853] As Paul again is defending this true gospel message. One is this, Paul's gospel is the real gospel.
[time=1860] And two, the real gospel impacts daily living. Each of these will have just two quick sub points.
[time=1867] The first one, Paul's gospel is the real gospel. He uses two arguments to prove this point.
[time=1875] The first argument is this, it's that Paul's gospel was revealed to him directly by God.
[time=1882] Look again at chapter 1 verse 12, he says this, "For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ."
[time=1895] He not only says it in a positive way, but in the negative way, look at verse 11.
[time=1899] He says, "I'd have you no brothers that the gospel preached by me is not man's gospel. Its origin wasn't from some human tradition."
[time=1910] Verse 12, "For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it."
[time=1916] Verse 16, he says, "But when God was pleased to reveal his son and me in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone."
[time=1927] He didn't talk with anyone, he received it, and Paul is going to great lengths to make a distinction between the origin of the two messages that the Galatians were hearing.
[time=1938] There are numerous groups which hold tight to their dogma, passed down from generation to generation. There's a way of doing things, right?
[time=1948] Well, this is the exact opposite of what Paul is stating. He was saying this, "There was no classroom I went to, there was no tradition handed down to me, there was no Kool-Aid to drink."
[time=1959] Paul received the gospel through a sovereign and supernatural means. It was an appointment through God.
[time=1969] He was appointed, look at verse 15 of chapter 1, "When he who had set me apart before I was born, before Paul was even born, God had placed a seal upon him that he would be a messenger to the Gentiles of this gospel."
[time=1989] And then he received it, we already saw that in verse 12, it came from God. Second Peter says this, and it gives us a powerful example here.
[time=2000] Second Peter chapter 1, starting in verse 16, says this, "For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty," it says.
[time=2018] And then go down in verse 20, knowing this, first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from one's own interpretation.
[time=2026] For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Spirit.
[time=2036] Same thing is true here. Paul received this gospel message that yes, sometimes seemed too good to be true, but it wasn't a human concoction.
[time=2046] It came down straight from a revelation to God, from God.
[time=2052] So Paul wanted the Galatians to stop deserting the God who had called them into this gospel for a different gospel.
[time=2062] His first argument is that the gospel is from God directly. The second argument is this, that Paul's gospel was affirmed by the apostles.
[time=2076] It's important to understand a little bit of the historical context here. The distorted gospel was not unique to the Galatians or to the church at large. It was a New Testament church issue.
[time=2089] There were crucial questions in those early years of the church being addressed. How is one saved? Who is Jesus? How do we live as Christians?
[time=2100] And so Paul, in chapter 2, verse 1, says he went up to Jerusalem.
[time=2106] The issues were so real and critical that even doubt had crept into Paul's mind about his gospel.
[time=2114] Look at verse 2 of chapter 2. He says this, "I went up to Jerusalem because of a revelation and set before them, though privately before those who seemed influential, the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles in order to make sure I was not running or had not run in vain."
[time=2134] These issues were so clouded, so controversial that even doubt had crept into Paul's mind regarding the true nature of the gospel.
[time=2145] And so he went up to Jerusalem and in order to better understand what was going on there, turn in your Bibles to the Book of Acts.
[time=2153] This is known as the Jerusalem Council. In Acts chapter 15, there was a gathering of leaders, those in Jerusalem, but also those from around the area.
[time=2167] They came together to discuss this. It was a council that they would come together and hopefully find agreement on this idea of how is one saved.
[time=2178] That was the question on the docket. Or more clearly, are works necessary for salvation?
[time=2187] So it says this in Acts chapter 15, "But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, unless you're circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."
[time=2200] In other words, you have to perform some sort of work on your behalf in order to have salvation with God, too.
[time=2210] And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and to mate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the other were appointed to go to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question.
[time=2222] So being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles and brought great joy to all the brothers.
[time=2232] When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared what God had done with them.
[time=2240] But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up and said, "It is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses."
[time=2251] You see the debate going on here? The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter, and after there had been much debate, this was the debate that Paul had gone up to in our Galatians passage.
[time=2265] Peter stood up and said to them, "Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe, and God who knows the heart bore witness to them by giving them the Holy Spirit just as He did to us, and He made no distinction between us and them having cleansed their hearts by faith.
[time=2288] Now therefore, why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear, but we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus just as they will?"
[time=2307] And so they determined at the Jerusalem Council that works were not necessary for salvation, but only the grace of God.
[time=2318] So now we get Paul's commentary on Acts 15 in our passage in Galatians.
[time=2323] What happened in Jerusalem was a complete victory for Paul and the gospel that he preached.
[time=2329] Circumcism, he says in chapter 2, verse 3, was not necessary.
[time=2334] Verse 6, he states very clearly that the apostles, when he was up there, added nothing to his gospel message.
[time=2341] And in verse 9, the apostles gave Paul the right hand of fellowship, which simply means they put a stamp of approval upon his gospel message that it was solely the grace of Christ.
[time=2355] You say, why is this such a big deal that he went up to Jerusalem and got the apostles' affirmation?
[time=2361] Because the people teaching the distorted gospel in Galatia claimed to be from Jerusalem and that their message was from the leaders there.
[time=2372] In other words, dogma coming down from the CEO.
[time=2376] By referencing his trip to Jerusalem, Paul shows that these people are advancing their own agenda and not that of the Church of Jerusalem.
[time=2389] So Paul uses two arguments.
[time=2392] To persuade the believers to come back to the true gospel, one, his gospel message was not from human origin.
[time=2401] It came to him directly revealed by God.
[time=2405] And secondly, it was affirmed by the apostles and the elders from Jerusalem.
[time=2411] He had the stamp of approval upon this gospel message that sometimes seems too good to be true.
[time=2422] The second main point, first, Paul's gospel was the real gospel.
[time=2429] Second, the real gospel impacts daily living.
[time=2434] We find that starting in verse 11, and let's take a look at Peter's hypocrisy really quickly.
[time=2443] When Cephas came to Antioch, Cephas is another word for Peter, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned.
[time=2453] For before certain men came from James, he felt free or he was eating with the Gentiles.
[time=2460] But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party.
[time=2468] And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.
[time=2476] So let's understand the situation here.
[time=2479] Peter was here, and Peter felt the freedom to eat meals with the Gentiles
[time=2487] and probably to partake of the same meats that they were eating, meats that maybe once were not accepted before by Jewish law and custom.
[time=2496] But now because of the gospel, he felt free to partake.
[time=2502] And yet when those people came from Jerusalem into that same context,
[time=2511] now all of a sudden he changed his mind and he drew back from the Gentiles and didn't partake with them and their meal anymore, but then drew back into the way that he had related to God before.
[time=2526] The issue here is this. Paul says it specifically in verse 14.
[time=2532] When I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel,
[time=2539] their behavior was not in line with the truth of the gospel.
[time=2544] In fact, their behavior was actually in line with the law.
[time=2551] Philippians 1, 27 says this.
[time=2554] Let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ.
[time=2559] In other words, let the way that you live be shaped by and impacted by the gospel of Christ.
[time=2568] You see, here again is where we may struggle, this idea of not living in a way that's in line with the gospel,
[time=2576] not in gaining our salvation, but in our ongoing maintenance of it.
[time=2583] You see, again, the opposite is behavior that takes its shape from the law.
[time=2587] It's performance-oriented, it's law-based, and it's anti-gospel.
[time=2593] It's attempting to receive forgiveness from God and acceptance by God through our obedience to God.
[time=2601] At the end of the day, it's just legalism wrapped up in different pictures,
[time=2607] but legalism is simply this, it's self- atonement.
[time=2611] It's trying to atone for your sins based upon your own behavior.
[time=2617] And self- atonement really just leads to self-worship.
[time=2622] Because if I have some sort of play in my own justification, then in all reality I have some sort of responsibility.
[time=2630] And if I have some sort of responsibility, then the credit can come back to partly to me.
[time=2638] Peter's behavior was legalistic, it was performance-based, it was not in line with the gospel,
[time=2648] and ours is oftentimes not either.
[time=2652] When I fail to be generous, even though I know God is abundant in his generosity to me,
[time=2661] I'm not in line with the gospel.
[time=2666] Even if I feel the one receiving my generosity might be taking advantage of me.
[time=2674] I take advantage of him all the time.
[time=2678] And yet he continues to pour out his grace to me based upon the merits of Christ.
[time=2685] And for me to withhold my generosity to someone else, because I feel like they're going to take advantage of me,
[time=2692] or they are taking advantage of me, that they might take what I give them and use it on something that might not be appropriate.
[time=2699] That's out of step with the gospel.
[time=2704] And certainly there may be issues that bring some complications into that discussion.
[time=2708] I understand that.
[time=2710] And yet understand this, when God has been so generous to you, how can we not be generous?
[time=2719] When I fail to forgive someone, even though moments ago I just confessed my sin and received forgiveness from God,
[time=2727] I'm not in line with the gospel.
[time=2732] How can I not forgive someone when I have just been forgiven much?
[time=2738] It's conduct or behavior that's not in line with the gospel.
[time=2744] It might not be behavior, it might be thinking. When I look down on someone, because they're stuck in a sin,
[time=2751] even though I commit maybe a different sin, but I'm stuck in that same different sin.
[time=2757] It's not in line with the gospel.
[time=2761] It's not behavior that flows out of what God has done for me.
[time=2766] It's exactly what Peter was doing. And Paul said, listen, you're not, that conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel.
[time=2779] You see our temptation, my temptation, I would only guess that it's yours.
[time=2784] It's the fall prey to the same trap the Galatians did, to use the law to feel better about myself when I obey.
[time=2793] To use it to my credit or on the flip side, to use the law to feel better about me when I see someone else disobeying.
[time=2801] At least I'm not doing that. Somehow that gets back to me and I feel better about myself.
[time=2809] But I do it. I use the law in that way. I'm tempted to anyways.
[time=2815] And the reality is we live in a current culture where there's really almost no way to avoid it.
[time=2820] I mean, we're surrounded by a performance-based world system.
[time=2824] It's really, it's in the air that we breathe and it's really, it's natural.
[time=2828] It's actually, it's that which flows out of our flesh.
[time=2831] Our entire world system is based upon this law-based performance-based approach to life.
[time=2837] And some of it isn't wrong.
[time=2840] I mean, we think about our judicial system.
[time=2843] If you commit a felony, there's going to be a punishment.
[time=2848] And we want the judicial system to function in that way.
[time=2851] In our workplaces, the one who works harder or stays longer, sometimes is the one who gets promoted.
[time=2857] In our friendships, as long as you're nice to me, then I'll go ahead and be a friend to you.
[time=2863] In Christmas, as long as you're nice, things work out okay, right?
[time=2871] But if you're naughty, all you're going to get is a piece of coal.
[time=2877] Karma, every other world religion, if I do good, then I'm going to somehow receive good.
[time=2885] And if I do enough good, in some systems, I can come back again and be something better.
[time=2891] Every other world religion is anti-gospel.
[time=2898] And again, understand this, that in some of these instances, biblical principles undergird this truth.
[time=2904] You reap what you sow, Galatians says later.
[time=2907] Don't be deceived, right?
[time=2910] God has given us rulers to keep the peace.
[time=2913] It's God's common grace.
[time=2915] The problem occurs when we bring this system of morality into the way that we relate to God and in most of our relationships.
[time=2922] When we begin to believe that our right relationship with God is gained or maintained by our own acts of obedience,
[time=2930] that's where it starts to not fall in line with gospel truth.
[time=2937] You see, this gospel is amazing, there's nothing else like it, and it's a daily battle to believe it.
[time=2943] And our lack of belief can be detected when we find ourselves, see if you can relate to any of these.
[time=2951] We're tempted not to believe the full scope of the gospel.
[time=2955] And our lack of belief can be detected when we find ourselves more concerned about what others may think of us
[time=2962] rather than what God thinks of us.
[time=2965] That's what Peter was dealing with when he was more concerned about what the Judaizers might think,
[time=2971] or those Christians who had still some sort of Pharisaical take on things.
[time=2976] Our lack of belief can be detected when we find ourselves more consumed with our daily activities than the cross of Christ.
[time=2986] When we find ourselves more familiar with our past sins than the work of Christ and his forgiveness.
[time=2995] When we find ourselves living with low-grade guilt, or when we find ourselves feeling obligated to serve,
[time=3002] or obligated to pray, or obligated to read our Bible, certainly those are good things,
[time=3008] but they can be approached in a wrong way.
[time=3012] Our lack of belief can be detected when we find ourselves simply lacking joy.
[time=3017] When we find ourselves unable to forgive ourselves or others, when we find ourselves treating others in a way different than God's treated us, when we're quick to judge, thinking we're better than most, or when we hold others to a higher standard than we even hold ourselves.
[time=3033] It's a lack of belief in the pure gospel.
[time=3040] So this behavior not in line with the gospel is serious.
[time=3044] And it's why Paul comes out so strong in his defense as he opposes Peter to his face.
[time=3051] You see, the real gospel needs to impact every area of our lives, every relationship we'll ever have,
[time=3058] and it changes the way that we think and we act.
[time=3062] That was Peter's hypocrisy.
[time=3068] Finally, as we end here quickly, Paul's humility, how did he handle this gospel?
[time=3074] It starts in verse 15 of chapter 2 as he talks about his own life.
[time=3082] And notice the clarity that he has about this gospel.
[time=3086] In verse 16, he says it three times in one verse.
[time=3091] We know that a person is not justified by the works of the law.
[time=3098] So we also have believed in Christ Jesus in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law.
[time=3106] And finally, the last phrase, because by the works of the law, no one will be justified.
[time=3114] He's clear in his belief that no works or no merit on his behalf could add to his salvation or somehow maintain his right standing with God
[time=3127] into eternity.
[time=3129] He says it again in verse 21.
[time=3131] I do not nullify the grace of God for if righteousness were through the law,
[time=3137] then Christ died for no purpose.
[time=3143] You know, there's no percentage of need that varies from individual to individual
[time=3151] of how much grace they need, of how much Jesus they need.
[time=3154] There's no, oh, that person is so good. He only needs 10% of Jesus or that person needs 50% of Jesus.
[time=3161] We all need 100% of what Jesus offers us.
[time=3170] It's the real gospel.
[time=3172] And notice where Paul keeps his thoughts that inform his actions.
[time=3178] He says it in verse 20.
[time=3183] I've been crucified with Christ.
[time=3186] It's no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me and the life that I now live in the flesh.
[time=3194] I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.
[time=3204] You see where Paul is keeping his thoughts and hopefully allowing his actions to flow out of.
[time=3209] It's this idea of faith, to take God at his word, faith in the Son of God.
[time=3215] And it's this Son of God who gave himself for Paul.
[time=3221] It's the real gospel impacting every day of Paul's life.
[time=3225] And we can see, we won't have time to do it this morning, but to see in verse 16 and 17 and 18
[time=3231] about how he describes his own ministry and how he allows the gospel to impact that ministry.
[time=3238] Serious battle going on in the book of Galatians.
[time=3247] Is the gospel too good to be true?
[time=3253] Or is it real?
[time=3258] Is it a reality that we can be made right with our Creator based upon the work of Jesus Christ on our behalf
[time=3265] some 2,000 years ago as he died on Calvary and rose again.
[time=3270] And as he promised that he's coming back again, can we count on that?
[time=3275] Is it real or is it just too good to be true?
[time=3280] It's too good to be true that God would call us into the grace of Christ.
[time=3285] That it was his idea that he doesn't want us relating to him in a performance based transactional way.
[time=3293] Well, Paul would come back and say this, and his gospel.
[time=3298] This message that came from God through him is the real gospel.
[time=3305] It was received by Paul through a revelation from God.
[time=3308] It was affirmed by the apostles and this real gospel impacts daily living.
[time=3314] This morning, would you believe the gospel again, a fresh and anew?
[time=3320] Would you look for ways this morning where your conduct isn't lining up with the truth of the gospel?
[time=3329] I don't know where that is for you this morning.
[time=3334] I know it's prevalent.
[time=3336] I know it's prevalent in my life.
[time=3338] The more and more that I understand the gospel, the more and more I see areas that are not in line with the gospel.
[time=3346] Ways that I treat my spouse that aren't in line with the gospel, ways that I treat my kids, ways that I approach my work or lots of different areas.
[time=3358] It may be this morning that the best application that you can receive is that you need to repent of an area that God has just brought to your mind.
[time=3370] And when you repent of that, then you come back and again to live in line with the gospel, which means that sin is gone and there is no condemnation anymore.
[time=3381] Because Christ has taken that and live in the good of your forgiveness and rejoice in your Savior Jesus.
[time=3388] It may be this morning that you just need to say thank you again to the Lord.
[time=3397] Allow your heart to be so filled with his goodness and his grace.
[time=3402] The truth of this amazing message, the gospel of Jesus Christ, that you just need to be grateful and allow your heart to be full so that you'll live a life that will be in line with your gospel, with his gospel.
[time=3420] It may be this morning you've never come to Christ.
[time=3425] I can tell you this morning, no one loves you more or better than Jesus and no one has done more or will ever do more for you than Jesus has done.
[time=3438] You simply ask for you to confess your sin, to repent of your sin, which simply means to change your direction.
[time=3448] You are following your own way.
[time=3450] Now he wants you to humble yourself and to follow his ways.
[time=3455] It doesn't have to be done perfectly.
[time=3457] It's his grace, whether it's you coming today or whether it's us walking with him.
[time=3463] It's all the grace of Christ.
[time=3465] This morning if you need to come to know him for the first time, there'll be people down front and we'd love to talk to you about that.
[time=3474] The gospel is the greatest message that you will ever come across.
[time=3480] It is the greatest message that you can receive and it's the greatest message that you can give.
[time=3487] So may we be a people that are focused on the center of Christianity, which is who Christ is and what he's done for the glory of God through the work of the Spirit.
[time=3496] God, thank you so much this morning for what you've done for us.
[time=3499] We love you.
[time=3500] I pray this morning that if someone doesn't know you, that they might come to know you.
[time=3505] I pray that they would feel the freedom and the rest and the joy that comes from being called into the grace of Christ.
[time=3515] For those of us this morning that know you, God, would you help us to identify and see those areas where our life is not lining up with the gospel?
[time=3526] And then would you help us to live in the good of it?
[time=3529] For your glory and for your honor.
[time=3532] I pray this all in Christ's name.
[time=3534] [AMEN]
