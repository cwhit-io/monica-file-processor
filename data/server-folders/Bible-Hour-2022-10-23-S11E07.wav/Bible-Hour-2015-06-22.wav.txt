[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=30] >> My name is James Thomas, and I've attended Black Hawk for about two years, and this is my story.
[time=44] The first 33 years of my life were full of sin, sure I had been brought up in the Episcopal Church,
[time=52] and knew about Jesus but really didn't know him. Until age 34, I was living a life that was going nowhere.
[time=64] It was all about me. It was just trying to satisfy the craving I had. I was on the road to hell, literally.
[time=74] In age 34, my father came down with cancer, and he battled that for about a year. And until the end, when he got really sick,
[time=84] and I had to fly home to South Bend, Indiana, from Dallas, Texas, where I was living at the time,
[time=91] and got to the hospital, got to talk to my dad, see him, and so forth.
[time=97] And, you know, but while I was in that hospital under those circumstances, things just begin to pile up inside of me.
[time=107] And I realized, you know, my father's lying in his deathbed, I have no control over it.
[time=117] And I started seeing myself for what I really was.
[time=123] I started looking back at my life and the sin I was going through and things I was doing that were not right.
[time=129] It was all about me, like I said. And, you know, for the first time in my life, I realized that I needed Jesus Christ in my life,
[time=138] that I needed to know God. I needed to know if he was there, if he was real, if he cared about me.
[time=144] And for the very first time in my life in the waiting room at Memorial Hospital, I said, "Lord, if you're real, if you're there, I need to know.
[time=161] And if you are, I will change my life for you, I will live for you."
[time=167] I know more than said those words. And I felt something that I had never felt before.
[time=175] I felt God reaching down from heaven, wrapping his arms around me, just holding me and loving me.
[time=185] Such a peace. And the Bible talks about the peace that passeth all understanding.
[time=191] I had that peace that afternoon in that waiting room. It was beautiful. It was just absolutely beautiful.
[time=198] And I felt something that I felt God's love. I felt his peace. I felt his warmth.
[time=204] And I thought to myself, you know, I mean, God is real. God is there. He loves me.
[time=212] And life has never been the same since. The Jim Thomas that walked in that waiting room at the hospital was different than the Jim Thomas that left.
[time=224] I mean, totally turned me around. And so life went on. And here it is, you know, 30 some odd years later.
[time=233] And I've tried to walk my life by faith. And faith, according to Hebrews 11-1, is the confident expectation of what we hope for will come to pass.
[time=245] And, you know, I've lived my life by that. And I've seen a lot of good things happen.
[time=250] But in December of 2013, after a hernia operation, during the hernia operation, it was discovered that I had a cancerous lesion.
[time=262] Well, you know, they looked at that. And I made an appointment with my oncologist.
[time=269] And I was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. And if that didn't hit you like a, you know, like a brick,
[time=280] you know, they told me that I was very fortunate because the cancer had not spread to the any major organs, just the lymph nodes.
[time=288] And so I was fortunate there. And I was in good health otherwise.
[time=292] So the doctor proceeded to tell me that we're going to start chemotherapy.
[time=297] And so, of course, you know, I had a lot of people praying for me. And just my faith was strong.
[time=304] And after four sessions of chemo, the doctor came back and said, "Things are going great. You're almost in remission."
[time=313] And I couldn't believe it, you know. He said, "We're going to do four more treatments." And he said, "I think you're going to be in full remission." So we did four more. I was in full remission. Life was good.
[time=324] I get it, but test, you know, once a month and make sure it was still gone and it was.
[time=330] I enjoyed all that summer, you know, camping and just having a great time so thankful.
[time=335] And then in December of that year, the cancer came back.
[time=341] Now, when we did it come back, it was discovered that along with the cancer that came back,
[time=347] I also had a brain tumor, which was in my cerebellum in the back of the head.
[time=352] And that had to be taken care of before we could resume chemotherapy.
[time=357] So that on January 19th of this year, that was removed by a surgeon here at Parkview North.
[time=364] And all was good. And then I restarted my chemo and have been doing chemotherapy all this year.
[time=374] And that ended after six sessions. And now I'm in remission and I'm in maintenance.
[time=381] I'm on maintenance, which is one drug through my port, which I have installed, instead of four drugs every two weeks.
[time=391] And I also take chemo pills.
[time=394] So, and I'll be doing that ongoing for a while. I'm not sure for how long, but it's keeping me in remission.
[time=401] And, you know, so I'm very thankful for all that.
[time=405] But, you know, through this whole thing, I look at this one verse that sticks out to me, Proverbs 3.5.
[time=414] Trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean not on your own understanding.
[time=418] I can't figure out what happened or why it happened.
[time=422] But I know that, and I say this sometimes, the cancer has almost been a blessing.
[time=429] Because it has drawn me so much closer to God.
[time=433] And I'm able to share with people.
[time=436] And it's just been a really amazing walk through this with Jesus.
[time=442] He's there all the time for me, 24/7.
[time=445] When I would come home from chemo and sit there in my recliner and not feel good.
[time=453] I'd look up at that cross that hangs up my living room wall.
[time=465] And I'd say, think to myself, you know, what I'm going through is nothing compared to what Jesus Christ did on that cross for me.
[time=474] At Calvary.
[time=477] And also, another thing that I have to bring up is, in Psalms 23, the last verse says,
[time=488] "Goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
[time=495] And, you know, even through all this cancer, goodness and mercy are always there.
[time=502] And they will be there to my last breath.
[time=506] And I just thank the Lord Jesus Christ for being my Lord and Savior.
[time=531] A wonderful merciful Savior.
[time=536] Precious, redeemer and friend.
[time=542] Who would have thought that a lamb could rescue the souls of men?
[time=553] Oh, you rescue the souls of men.
[time=563] Counselor, converter, keeper, spirit we long to embrace.
[time=575] You offer hope when our hearts have hopelessly lost away.
[time=586] Oh, we hopelessly lost away.
[time=594] You are the one that we praise.
[time=606] You give the healing and grace out.
[time=612] Hearts always hunger for all our hearts always hunger for all.
[time=632] All mighty, infinite Father, faithfully loving your own.
[time=644] Here in our weakness you find us, calling before your throne.
[time=655] Oh, we're falling before your throne.
[time=662] You are the one that we praise.
[time=668] You are the one we adore.
[time=674] You give the healing and grace out.
[time=680] Hearts always hunger for all our hearts always hunger for.
[time=692] You are the one that we praise.
[time=698] You are the one we adore.
[time=704] You give the healing and grace out.
[time=710] Hearts always hunger for all our hearts always hunger for all.
[time=723] Well, good morning.
[time=729] As Darren said, my name is Tony and I serve as one of the leaders within Northeast Christian Church here in Fort Wayne.
[time=738] But as many of you know, I grew up around here.
[time=741] Actually, both my wife Hannah and I, we grew up within Black Hawk Christian School and within Black Hawk Church.
[time=747] We came to know Jesus here, we were educated here, we were discipled here, we were given our first opportunities to lead around here.
[time=757] They were part of the church here for a long time.
[time=762] Hannah's parents, Jeff and Claire, they are part of the school staff team here and our oldest child, Shalom, will be in kindergarten right across the street in just a couple months here this fall.
[time=775] So even though it has now been over six years, if you can believe that, it's hard for me to believe.
[time=780] It's now been over six years since you all sent us out to serve and lead in a different context.
[time=786] We just, we want you to know, we have a deep love, and I mean that, a deep love for Black Hawk and for you all.
[time=796] And we very much feel like family around here, even now just looking out and seeing so many familiar faces.
[time=804] And so it is a real honor and privilege and joy for us to get to be with you today and for me to get to stand up here and to serve in this way.
[time=815] Certainly over the last six plus years, a lot has happened.
[time=819] You see up here on the screens, a picture of our family from a few months ago on Resurrection Sunday.
[time=824] And this is part of our family and you can see there we have a five and a half year old daughter named Shalom.
[time=831] And as her preschool teacher said, Shalom brings a zest for life.
[time=836] She brings a zest wherever she goes. Just a few days ago, we were having a conversation.
[time=841] Shalom is going to be taking a ballet class here in a few weeks and I was teasing her.
[time=845] And I said, Shalom, I'm going to also be in your class, which is like a disturbing image at all kinds of levels, right?
[time=851] But I was teasing her and saying, I was going to be in the class and she walked right up to me and she said,
[time=857] Dad, guys can't do that, especially old men like you.
[time=862] And that is Shalom.
[time=869] We also, as you can see in this picture here, we have a one year old son named Moses.
[time=874] And Moses is an incredibly delightful and also somewhat destructive little boy.
[time=881] He likes cars and blocks and just this week he started liking books and he really likes food.
[time=887] Like this kid eats food, just a ton of food already.
[time=890] But the strange thing is he doesn't like meat or eggs or cheese.
[time=894] In other words, somehow this little one year old boy is a vegan already.
[time=899] I have no idea how that happened, but we are so, so thankful for both of them.
[time=903] And I mentioned that this is just part of our family because as many of you know, we have been in the process of, if you go to the next slide of bringing this precious little guy into our home.
[time=916] This is Sajes, it's the French word for wisdom, Sajes, so we also have been calling him Saj.
[time=922] He is a four year old boy who lives right now in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
[time=927] And we've been in the process of adopting Saj for well over two years now.
[time=932] His mom and dad, his biological parents, they abandoned him and since that time he has lived in three different orphanages
[time=939] and he now lives with a foster family in the capital city of Congo called Kinshasa.
[time=946] Sajes legally our son in Congo, and it's been that way for over a year and a half.
[time=952] But as you may know, the Congolese government has put a halt on.
[time=956] They have blocked all international adoptions from finalizing.
[time=960] And as you can imagine, as we've been waiting, this has just been so hard.
[time=965] Let me just look at him, right?
[time=966] It's been so hard, it's been at times heartbreaking and just the story's been full of twists and turns.
[time=973] But we are committed to praying and waiting and working to bring this little boy into our home and family
[time=980] and into our community, and may it be someday soon.
[time=984] And everybody agreed and said, "Amen, thank you." And today my brothers and sisters, we are going to take a look at Psalm 23.
[time=995] And so I'll invite you now, if you would like to, to turn into Bible to Psalm 23, or if you would prefer, the passages of Scripture will also come up here on the screens as we get to them.
[time=1005] Psalm 23.
[time=1009] Also known as the 23rd Psalm is a song.
[time=1014] Most of the Psalms, they are a collection of ancient Hebrew songs, and Psalm 23 is one of them.
[time=1021] It is a song that was crafted by King David, somewhere around 1000 BC.
[time=1027] So somewhere around 3000 years ago.
[time=1031] And it is one of the most famous, most beloved, most known songs in all of human history.
[time=1037] It's rehearsed with children at night before bed.
[time=1041] It is read in hospital rooms to the sick.
[time=1044] It's recited in funerals and on battlefields and in locker rooms before big games
[time=1050] and in gatherings of the church like this.
[time=1053] And that makes total sense because these poetic words here in this Psalm are so deep
[time=1060] and so rich and so full, and they speak so powerfully and so directly to us as God's people.
[time=1069] Especially, especially to those who are in need.
[time=1075] Especially to those of us here today who are struggling for one reason or another
[time=1081] and are in need of guidance or peace or comfort or new life.
[time=1088] And so this morning we are going to take a look at the first portion of this ancient, beautiful, inspired Hebrew song that we often call Psalm 23.
[time=1099] And it says this.
[time=1102] The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
[time=1108] He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[time=1112] He leads me beside quiet waters.
[time=1115] He refreshes my soul.
[time=1117] He guides me along the right paths for his name's sake.
[time=1123] Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil for you are with me.
[time=1129] Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[time=1134] And may the Lord our God bless the reading and studying and proclamation of His word today
[time=1141] and everyone agreed and said, amen.
[time=1144] And so as you can see here in these verses, David is using throughout a metaphor.
[time=1151] David is using a metaphor here to describe God, to describe who God is
[time=1158] and what He is like.
[time=1161] David begins the song by proclaiming the Lord or Yahweh is my shepherd.
[time=1166] And that is a picture or an image or a metaphor.
[time=1171] And now we have to understand that in the Western world, in the Western world in which most of us
[time=1177] I'm guessing in here have lived for all, for most if not all of our lives.
[time=1182] In the Western world, we tend to think in terms of abstract concepts and words and definitions.
[time=1189] Although, by the way, this is changing with the younger generations.
[time=1193] But we tend to think in abstract words and definitions.
[time=1197] And so even as it relates to describing God in our attempts to describe God,
[time=1203] we often use abstract concepts like transcendent and omnipotent.
[time=1210] He's all powerful and omniscient, meaning he knows everything and those of course are all very true about him and very in line with the word of God.
[time=1221] But we have to understand that the Eastern world and the Eastern mind is different.
[time=1228] The Eastern mind, which is the language of the Bible, thinks not primarily in abstract definitions, but rather in pictures and images and metaphors.
[time=1240] And so the writers of the Bible often present the glorious God of the universe by, in essence,
[time=1246] painting a picture of him with words.
[time=1250] They say things like, "God is a rock."
[time=1256] That's an image, that is a metaphor aimed at describing God.
[time=1262] They say, "God is a father.
[time=1265] God is a warrior.
[time=1267] God is a king." And here in Psalm 23 we find one of the most powerful metaphors used throughout the Bible.
[time=1274] God is a shepherd.
[time=1278] The God of the universe is a shepherd and not just that, not just that he is a shepherd.
[time=1285] No, David here, he makes it really, really personal for all of God's people.
[time=1290] He says, "My shepherd, the Lord is my shepherd."
[time=1296] And this is an image that the ancient Israelites would have resonated with deeply.
[time=1302] You see, they were all very, very familiar with shepherds and sheep.
[time=1307] Because every single one of them either owned their own flock or they often saw the shepherds
[time=1313] leading their sheep to settle and graze along the settled areas.
[time=1317] In fact, we know from the Word of God that King David, before he was king, he was a shepherd.
[time=1324] And David writes this.
[time=1326] Again, in verse 1, he says, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=1330] I lack nothing." Or some translations, as you know, say, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=1335] I shall not be in one.
[time=1337] I shall not want." And then he goes on from there in the next couple verses to unpack that very powerful statement that he begins with.
[time=1346] And in verses 2 and 3, notice there, if you're looking at it, notice who the subject is.
[time=1351] It says, "He makes me lie down.
[time=1355] He leads me.
[time=1357] He refreshes me.
[time=1359] He guides me." And so again, David is painting a picture of who God is and what he is like.
[time=1368] And so brothers and sisters, when we step back for a moment and we gaze, many of us once again
[time=1375] at this picture that King David is painting, here is what we see.
[time=1381] Here is one way to say it this morning.
[time=1383] It's going to come up here on the screen.
[time=1387] "My shepherd is with me, and he deeply cares for me."
[time=1395] That is the heart of the message today.
[time=1399] "My shepherd is with me, and he deeply cares for me."
[time=1405] If you want to write something down today, if you want to walk away rehearsing something in your heart and soul and mind, if you want to have something to share with those around you, that right there is it.
[time=1417] "My shepherd is with me, and he deeply, deeply cares for me."
[time=1424] And that is what a good shepherd was like in ancient Israel.
[time=1427] That is what God is like toward us as people.
[time=1430] And if that is true brothers and sisters, that changes everything.
[time=1438] Verse two.
[time=1441] Again, he says, "He," David writes, "He, my shepherd, makes me lie down in green pastures.
[time=1448] He, my shepherd, leads me beside quiet waters.
[time=1459] He, my shepherd, refreshes or restores or revitalizes my soul or my life.
[time=1465] He, my shepherd, guides me along the right paths for his name's sake." And in order to see what's happening here in this picture that David is painting, we have to understand that in this context, green pastures and quiet waters were rare commodities
[time=1477] for shepherds and sheep.
[time=1479] Because you see, the primary setting, the primary context for shepherding in ancient Israel was not the rolling grassy hills that perhaps we often imagine.
[time=1489] It was not the rolling grassy hills that we imagined because we've seen shows like
[time=1495] Downton Abbey or because we've seen pictures, some portraits that have been done trying to depict this scene here in the Psalm or anything like that.
[time=1503] No, the context for shepherding in ancient Israel was more like what you see up here
[time=1509] on the screen, which is a picture of the Judean wilderness.
[time=1514] That was the context.
[time=1516] The wilderness or in the Hebrew, the mead bar was not rolling grassy hills.
[time=1521] Rather, it was more like a desert.
[time=1525] The Judean wilderness, which is the context David has in mind was and actually still is to this very day a tough and often inhospitable environment.
[time=1536] The wilderness is a place of all kinds of troubles.
[time=1541] The wilderness is a place of extreme temperatures.
[time=1545] It can be overwhelmingly hot in the day and even dangerously cold at night.
[time=1552] I heard a story that even some certain times of the year sheep, if they're not cared for in the right way at night, that they can actually freeze to death.
[time=1561] The wilderness is a place like that, but it's also a place that is just filled with all kinds of dangerous predators, bandits that want to take the sheep,
[time=1572] wolves that want to eat the sheep, parasites and other insects that infest the sheep
[time=1578] and get in there and more.
[time=1579] Remember, King David himself, when he was a shepherd in the wilderness, he said that he killed a lion and a bear.
[time=1587] The wilderness is a place that is subject to drought, sometimes severe drought.
[time=1594] David writes in another Psalm, "My soul faints for you, O God, in a dry and weary land." And David is talking there about the wilderness.
[time=1605] And at the same time, the wilderness is a place, even though it's subject to drought, it's also at time subject to dangerous flash floods.
[time=1613] Without warning, the sky can be blue, and from 20, 30, even more miles away, a wall of water can just come sweeping through the valleys or ravines.
[time=1624] Just a few years ago, a 70-foot high wall of water came through a valley right there in the Judean wilderness and wiped out everything in its path, including any unsuspecting sheep.
[time=1637] And to all of these realities in the wilderness, sheep are completely defenseless.
[time=1647] To all of these tough realities in the wilderness, sheep are completely helpless and defenseless and hopeless to find life.
[time=1662] Unless they have a shepherd.
[time=1667] Let me say that again.
[time=1669] To all of these realities in the wilderness, sheep are completely and totally helpless and defenseless and hopeless unless they have a shepherd.
[time=1683] And brothers and sisters, that is true of us as well.
[time=1690] The Bible says that in the beginning, God created a world that was beautiful and good and flourishing.
[time=1698] But it also says in Genesis 3 that the very first humans, our ancestors rebelled against God, and since that time, the world has been characterized by brokenness.
[time=1709] I don't even have to say this.
[time=1711] I mean, we just look around and see it and experience it all the time.
[time=1714] The world has been characterized by brokenness and suffering and pain and evil and ultimately death.
[time=1721] In other words, since that time, the world has become more like the wilderness.
[time=1729] And in the post, Genesis 3, wilderness of this world, we all like sheep face all kinds of toils, dangers, and snares.
[time=1740] All of us, all of us in here, no one is exempt.
[time=1744] All of us in here see and experience all kinds of problems.
[time=1748] And some of that wilderness, let's be honest, some of that wilderness we bring on ourselves.
[time=1756] Some of it we bring on ourselves because we all, like sheep, have gone astray out there in the wilderness looking for life apart from God.
[time=1765] And so some of it we have brought on ourselves, but so much of it also has been thrust upon us by the brokenness of others and the world around us.
[time=1773] And in the midst of all of it, regardless of the source, in the midst of all of it, the reality is church.
[time=1780] We are completely helpless and defenseless and hopeless.
[time=1787] Unless we have a shepherd.
[time=1791] Unless we have a shepherd who is with us and who deeply cares for us.
[time=1800] Amen?
[time=1805] Northeast does the same thing.
[time=1807] You know, I have to try to wake everybody up every once in a while.
[time=1810] So notice there in verse two.
[time=1812] When David says he makes me lie down in green pastures, now that we know this context, we know that he is talking about a context in which green most of the time is really hard to find.
[time=1824] For most of the year, in most places in the wilderness, green is just usually little tufts of grass growing here and there.
[time=1832] And in the summer months, apparently tufts of grass can spring up in the morning from dew and then by the afternoon dry up from the afternoon heat.
[time=1842] And if that's true, you can imagine that water also, for most of the year, in most places in the wilderness is a real challenge to find.
[time=1850] Non-contaminated, safe water, safe from predators who are also trying to find water,
[time=1856] safe from parasites who are in the water, safe from those flash floods that come sweeping through non-contaminated, safe, quiet waters.
[time=1866] He leads me beside quiet waters, those were a rare and priceless commodity
[time=1872] in the wilderness.
[time=1874] And throughout the wilderness, apparently there were crisscrossing paths everywhere.
[time=1879] And some of those paths lead toward safety and rest, and some lead toward cliffs and trouble.
[time=1889] Some lead toward food and water green pastures and quiet waters, some lead toward dangerous predators.
[time=1896] Some of those paths lead toward life and some toward death.
[time=1902] And here's the thing.
[time=1904] Sheep have no idea which is which.
[time=1909] Sheep have no idea which are the right paths or, as David writes,
[time=1915] in some of our translations, the paths of righteousness.
[time=1918] Sheep see only what is right in front of them.
[time=1924] Man, I can so identify with that, right?
[time=1927] Sheep see only what is right in front of them, and sometimes sheep want things that lead toward death and destruction.
[time=1934] And so because of that, they need a shepherd who is with them and who, verse 3, guides them along the right paths.
[time=1947] One of our many, many fond memories of being a part of this church,
[time=1954] being a part of Blackhawk was back in 2008, where Hannah and I had the opportunity to go with a team of people over to Nairobi, Kenya, to visit a new life home trust.
[time=1965] Maybe you remember that name.
[time=1967] I'm not sure if you're still engaged as the church with them, but one of the things they do is they have an orphanage there in Nairobi, rescue, in essence, rescue babies, and nurture them and care for them, give them medical attention, and then most of those kids are adopted.
[time=1981] But some of the kids, once they get to a certain age, they're not adopted, and they're probably not going to be, and so they take them to another home where they're cared for and educated, and they tell them about Jesus and disciple them.
[time=1993] So really amazing thing, and most of those kids who don't get adopted, it's because they have some kind of physical ailment or something else that has gone wrong.
[time=2002] And one of the days that we were there, we got to go visit that other home, with these kids maybe ages five or six to twelve or so.
[time=2010] And there was this one little kid there who I'll just never forget.
[time=2013] Apparently his story is that he had been adopted, and just bad things happened, and he ended up coming now back to Nairobi and making his way somehow to new life home trust.
[time=2027] I don't know that part of the story, but this little kid, because of what happened to him, he just had scars.
[time=2031] You could see scars even on his face, just a horrible thing.
[time=2035] Talk about the wilderness, or as in a minute here, we're going to talk about the darkest valley, just a bad thing, but this little kid, his countenance, just was just amazing.
[time=2043] And on that day, I was out there as part of being there, playing soccer with him and these other little guys.
[time=2050] And I had these shoes on, these blue shoes, which are my favorite shoes that I've ever had in the world.
[time=2058] And in Nairobi, they kind of stood out because they were bright blue, they were so comfortable, and this picture is actually from our last day there, and right after this, I traded those amazing shoes.
[time=2068] They're not that amazing, but I love them.
[time=2070] I traded them for one of those rug things that you can see of there, which is like the worst trade that I won't tell you who got me to make that trade over here.
[time=2079] But I traded those shoes, and then I walked back to where we were staying and through the streets of Nairobi and my socks.
[time=2085] It was really quite a spectacle.
[time=2087] Anyway, a couple of days before that, I was playing soccer in those shoes, and one of my shoes came untied, and so I bent down onto my knee, and I'm tying my shoe, and this little kid comes up with scars on his face, and he asked me this innocent and yet penetrating and revealing question.
[time=2107] He said to me, "Who gave you those shoes?"
[time=2113] He said, "Who gave you those shoes?" I didn't say, "Where did you get those shoes?" Or, "Where did you buy those shoes?" No, he said, "Who gave you those shoes?" And in my mind, right away, I just kind of almost leaned back and laughed out loud because immediately I thought, "No one, nobody gave me these shoes." I bought them, I worked hard, I earned money, I went to the store, and I bought them for myself.
[time=2137] But you see, for this little guy, everything he had, it was toys or clothes or shoes, everything had been given to him.
[time=2148] And he thought, in his mind and in his little world, he thought that's the way it was for everyone.
[time=2155] And so the only question was, "Who gave them to you?" "Who gave you those shoes?" And church, here's the thing.
[time=2164] His perspective is more right than mine, and perhaps ours.
[time=2170] Because the reality is, everything we have has been given to us.
[time=2177] Everything, everything, food, clothes, our homes, jobs, cars,
[time=2183] shoes, family, our family, our friends, every single breath and even life itself.
[time=2190] Everything, literally, every good thing we have is a gift from our shepherd.
[time=2198] Everything, every good and perfect gift comes from him.
[time=2203] Our shepherd, who is with us and who deeply, deeply cares for us,
[time=2209] he deeply cares for us by providing for us, meeting all of our needs,
[time=2215] and often for us going way, way, way beyond that.
[time=2220] Our shepherd has been provided, look around it, your life.
[time=2223] Our shepherd has been providing for us, and we can trust that he will continue.
[time=2230] Because you see, he knows where the tufts of grass are.
[time=2236] He knows where the quiet waters reside.
[time=2241] He knows how to counter every threat and every affliction.
[time=2245] He knows the right paths, and he always hears this.
[time=2248] He always leads us.
[time=2251] He always leads us and restores us and moves us toward life.
[time=2257] And this, brothers and sisters, is what the God of the universe is like.
[time=2265] For those who are His covenant people in Jesus, God is powerfully and passionately at work to lead us toward life, even right now.
[time=2276] He is at work to lead every single one of us in Jesus toward true kingdom,
[time=2283] capital L life.
[time=2286] And he does so, David says, ultimately, for his name's sake.
[time=2292] Yes, it is for our good.
[time=2294] I mean, he loves us.
[time=2295] Oh, how he loves us.
[time=2297] It is for our good, but it is ultimately for his name's sake, for his glory and for his renown in this city, Fort Wayne, and among the nations.
[time=2307] My shepherd is with me, and he deeply cares for me.
[time=2315] And everyone agreed and said.
[time=2318] And then check out how David continues the song there in the next verse.
[time=2322] In verse 4, David goes from describing the shepherd and what he is like toward the sheep there,
[time=2328] and verses 2 and 3, and then there's this shift in the next verse.
[time=2332] In verse 4, where David now begins to pray to the shepherd, and he writes this.
[time=2339] "Even though I walk through the darkest valley," or some translations say,
[time=2345] "even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death." And as you may know, this is yet another reference to the wilderness.
[time=2354] Because you see throughout the wilderness, there were all kinds of ravines and valleys, like the one that you see coming up here on the screen.
[time=2362] And these valleys, as you can guess, would be dangerous places, especially as the darkness.
[time=2369] Especially as the darkness of night began to fall.
[time=2373] And David says, "Even though I walk through that valley, through the darkest valley," he says,
[time=2379] "I will fear no evil." Wow.
[time=2386] David says, "I will not fear.
[time=2389] I will not worry.
[time=2391] I will not be anxious.
[time=2394] I will not be controlled or dominated by fear of what might happen, or what evil might bring my way." He says, "I will fear no evil for you." Here's the prayer.
[time=2404] "For you are with me." "For you, my shepherd, are with me."
[time=2415] Our five-and-a-half-year-old daughter Shalom, just this week, has four reasons that we're still not clear about, had some fear.
[time=2424] We've had this off and on, but we haven't had it for a long time, but she started to have this fear this week.
[time=2430] And at times, it would even be kind of extreme fear, especially as the darkness of night began to come.
[time=2437] Perhaps some of you have experienced this with younger children, where you get them to sleep.
[time=2443] Well, first of all, there's some kind of battle that takes place, right?
[time=2445] But then you give in and you sit on their bed where they go to sleep, and then you try to sneak out of the room, but the bed makes a noise, so they wake up, or you try to, like, tip toe across the room in just the right spots, like some kind of American ninja warrior, whatever that's called.
[time=2459] So you don't want to wake them up, but we have a really old house, and so the floor is creak, and so it didn't work.
[time=2464] And so I ended up just, like, sitting there until she was peacefully asleep.
[time=2468] Again, some of you have been through this, so you might remember it, or you're in that season right now.
[time=2474] But it's interesting, because when she is alone this week, and we're going to get through this, right, Shalomi?
[time=2480] This is just this week.
[time=2482] All right, so when she's alone in her room, she's afraid.
[time=2485] And even, like, extremely afraid, but when I'm sitting there, she just sleeps peacefully.
[time=2493] She goes from great fear to total peace, and the only difference is that I am there with her.
[time=2502] The only difference is I am right there in the room with her, and for her, that changes everything.
[time=2510] And David says, I can walk through the darkest valley, even the darkest season of life.
[time=2518] Perhaps you're there today.
[time=2522] Even the darkest season of life.
[time=2524] I can walk through even the darkest place in the universe, and I will be at peace, for you, oh God, my shepherd, are with me.
[time=2534] For you are with me.
[time=2537] Your rod and your staff may come from me.
[time=2542] And the rod and the staff, as you may know, they were the typical tools of the Israelite Shepherd, and these tools are used by the shepherd in all kinds of ways to assist the sheep, think about this list, to assist the sheep, to guide the sheep along those right paths, to protect the sheep, to rescue the sheep from danger, to discipline the sheep, and to even gently care for the sheep.
[time=2566] And all of this only happens with the rod and the staff, because the shepherd is right there with the sheep.
[time=2575] Day and night.
[time=2578] Green pastures and darkest valley.
[time=2581] He knows the sheep.
[time=2583] He counts them every single day.
[time=2585] If one of them is lost, he goes searching for it.
[time=2588] He knows their name, and they know him, and they know his voice all because the shepherd is right there with them, not in the next room, not downstairs, not somewhere far away.
[time=2602] And I know the shepherd is right there with them.
[time=2608] As I mentioned a little bit earlier, our adoption story has just been some of you are familiar with.
[time=2615] It's been full of twists and turns.
[time=2617] When we got the referral for Saj, he had just turned two years old, and now he is four years old, and it has been hard, and as I mentioned, even heartbreaking at times to miss these precious and, let's be honest, irreplaceable years with him.
[time=2636] There was even one day back in December, just this past year, where we thought some stuff happened, and we thought that the whole adoption was off.
[time=2645] And then just two weeks ago, less than two weeks ago, there was a day where we thought we were going to have to start the whole process, like all of the paperwork, over again.
[time=2654] And so for us at times, this has been one of the darkest valleys that we have walked through.
[time=2661] And at the same time, we totally recognize that getting him here, and the process of getting him here is actually most likely the easy part, if you know what I mean.
[time=2671] We have no idea what impact all of this will have on him or on our family.
[time=2677] And so when I start to think about that, fear.
[time=2682] For me, fear begins to creep in.
[time=2686] And in the midst of all of it, all of the twists and turns and the darkest valley parts of it, God, throughout this whole story, He keeps reminding us in all kinds of ways that He is our shepherd and that He is with us.
[time=2703] And certainly, this isn't just related to things like adoption.
[time=2706] No, we all walk through the dark valley at some point.
[time=2711] Job loss, perhaps some in the room or walking through that valley these days.
[time=2718] Job loss, divorce, illness, cancer, a prodigal child, man.
[time=2726] So I was preparing and had that in the notes.
[time=2729] That just, man, brother or sister, if that's you, God, we pray right now, as a church, that you would touch the hearts and minds, break the hearts, soften the hearts of those children who just came to our minds right now.
[time=2749] God, do great and mighty things today now in this season to bring the prodigals back to you.
[time=2757] In Jesus' name, and everyone agreed on that and said amen.
[time=2762] Prodigal child, financial issues, self-worth issues that you just cannot seem to shake wounds from things that were done to you, anxiety, fear, depression, and ultimately death.
[time=2780] In this age, from Genesis chapter 3 until King Jesus returns and makes it all right, we all walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=2790] And it's important to say here that the promise is not, when we step back and we gaze at this beautiful picture that we see in Psalm 23, the promise is not that our circumstances are going to change.
[time=2802] They might, we want them to, and God might do that.
[time=2805] He's able to do that, but my circumstances might not change.
[time=2810] I will certainly still be in the wilderness, and I might even be in the darkest valley, but what changes church is my soul.
[time=2819] What changes is how I walk through that valley, how I go from living with fear, speaking about myself now, how I go from living with fear to now beginning to walk and live with peace and contentment and joy and rest to live with true life in Jesus, even as I walk through that valley because my shepherd is with me and he deeply cares for me.
[time=2854] And ultimately, here is how we know that all of this is true.
[time=2862] Because if this is true, I mean, again, this has the potential to change everything for us from the inside out, and here's how we know it is indeed true.
[time=2873] Jesus.
[time=2876] Jesus said in John 10, I am the good shepherd.
[time=2881] In other words, he is the one this song is proclaiming.
[time=2885] And in Jesus, we see that God is indeed.
[time=2888] When we look at Jesus, we see that God is indeed with us and that he does indeed deeply care for us.
[time=2896] And we see all of this most clearly in the cross, where the good shepherd laid down his life for us, the sheep.
[time=2905] And in Jesus, because of who he is and what he has done, we are now part of God's covenant people.
[time=2914] And so therefore, this ancient song is now our song.
[time=2920] And so brothers and sisters, if you are part of his flock, if you are a follower of Jesus today, Psalm 23, Proclaims that in a very real way, the majestic God of the universe is with you.
[time=2939] And he cares deeply for you.
[time=2943] And this is true all of the time, no matter what you are walking through.
[time=2951] It does not change based upon our circumstances.
[time=2955] It does not change based upon our thoughts or our emotions.
[time=2959] And hear this, it does not even grow or shrink based upon our level of devotion to him.
[time=2966] It is true all of the time, every single day and forever.
[time=2973] In fact, as we just heard at the very end of the song, David writes that God's goodness and love will follow me in the Hebrew there.
[time=2980] It's better translated, pursue me all the days, all the days of my life.
[time=2987] And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[time=2992] My dear, dear brothers and sisters of Blackhawk,
[time=2998] this is who God is and what he is like toward us.
[time=3005] And everyone agreed and said, amen.
[time=3009] And so this morning, we want to give you all an opportunity to respond.
[time=3015] And I know you do this periodically from time to time.
[time=3018] And certainly whenever we come to the Word of God, we all want to respond in all kinds of ways.
[time=3023] We want to see these things and be changed, not just in how we think, although it can start there, but in actually how we live.
[time=3030] And so we want to respond in all kinds of ways.
[time=3032] And this morning, one of those ways to respond is to immediately hear when this next song is taking place, to come forward for prayer.
[time=3041] There'll be some men and women up here, some elders and their wives to be here to be with you and to pray with and for you.
[time=3050] And so maybe you're here and you recognize that you have been like a sheep
[time=3056] going after life on your own, apart from God.
[time=3061] And best, as you have done that, you have had some mixed results as you've been out there on your own in the wilderness.
[time=3069] And as the team's coming forward here, let me just encourage you.
[time=3073] Because I want to say some things that might touch on some specific, not just groups of people, but the spirit of God might want to speak to some specific people to you today.
[time=3084] So don't allow the people coming up here to be a distraction and miss what I'm going to say.
[time=3089] Or more importantly, what God's going to say to you.
[time=3093] And so again, maybe you've been wandering around like a sheep without a shepherd.
[time=3098] And you're here this morning.
[time=3100] You've been asking, maybe you're here because you've been asking questions about life and about the church and most importantly about Jesus.
[time=3107] Or maybe you're just here today because you love somebody in here so much that you just, you're coming with them.
[time=3112] They asked you or even made you come.
[time=3115] And maybe today you sense that it is time for you to come to the Good Shepherd.
[time=3121] It's time for you to come to Jesus to find true capital L life.
[time=3126] That life that you have been searching everywhere for.
[time=3130] And if that is you, I just want to invite you during this song to come forward.
[time=3134] We would love to hear your story and to pray with you and begin this journey with you.
[time=3140] Or maybe today you are here and you know all of this.
[time=3144] You have Psalm 23 memorized or you've heard it a thousand times and yet at the same time in this season for whatever reason you have been going astray.
[time=3154] Young or old.
[time=3156] Again, like all of us have done, every single one.
[time=3160] Maybe you are the prodigal child who we just prayed for moments ago.
[time=3166] I can say that because I was a prodigal child.
[time=3169] I am a prodigal child returned to the Father and the Shepherd.
[time=3173] And maybe today is the day that you turn around.
[time=3178] To turn around and turn back to your Good Shepherd.
[time=3182] And if that is you again, the invitation is just to come forward.
[time=3186] We would love to pray with you and to get you connected with people who can journey with you as we follow our Shepherd together.
[time=3194] Or finally, maybe today you are in the valley.
[time=3202] Even those words perhaps from the Psalm, the darkest valley or the valley of the shadow of death for you when you hear them.
[time=3208] There's like something not just emotional but almost physical that happens.
[time=3212] Like this visceral gut wrenching, all too real feeling.
[time=3216] And today in the midst of those very legitimate questions and pain and sorrow and suffering, if that is you brother or sister, you too can come forward and we will just be with you and pray with you.
[time=3231] There's a line in this song here that says, "I will arise and go to Jesus."
[time=3237] He will embrace me in his arms.
[time=3241] And that's what he will do for all of us today as we turn to him. Because he is a good Shepherd and my Shepherd is with me. And he deeply, deeply, deeply cares for me.
[time=3257] And so let's all stand now to our feet. Let's arise together and let's sing this song in response to him.
[time=3265] And at this point, if your heart is being stirred in any of those or other ways during this song, now is the time for you to come forward.
[time=3295] [MUSIC - 236 seconds]
