[time=30] I'm Lori Miller, and I'm not ashamed of the Gospel, but I come from a long line of dysfunction, and I had a very shameful beginning.
[time=44] My story, it's one of rescue.
[time=48] My parents were not believers.
[time=52] We lived in a heathen home.
[time=54] There was no church, no Bible.
[time=57] My parents had a volatile relationship, and when I was only five, they were divorced.
[time=64] In that time, it wasn't that commonplace, like it is now, and my childhood, my early childhood was very rough.
[time=75] I lived with my mom, and the problem there was she wasn't very interested in being a parent.
[time=82] So, pretty much, I parented myself, and that did not work out very good.
[time=89] I was not able to do that.
[time=91] So, at an early age, I got into all kinds of difficulties, didn't do well in school, was smoking.
[time=102] Before you knew it, I was stealing, lying, running away from home, doing all these bad things to try to get her attention.
[time=111] As I got older, I became very confident in my ability to save myself.
[time=120] I was street smart, and I had built coping skills that I thought I could handle, whatever.
[time=128] So, coming from a heathen home, and then believing that I could save myself, it was a very natural step for me to become an atheist.
[time=138] And so, I did. I thought that Christianity, it was for people who were weak, and they didn't have all the skills that I had.
[time=149] So, they developed this God to help be their savior, and to make them feel better about their life.
[time=156] But I knew that you just lived until you died, and then you brought it in the ground.
[time=163] So, then there came a period of time, about four years, from about 17 to 21.
[time=172] And it was a slow, evolving process that I began to realize that there was more out there, that there was a God.
[time=183] I began to see things like nature. Around that time, I became married, and I was pregnant, and had my daughter.
[time=193] It was a huge awakening for me to understand that there was a God.
[time=199] But in the beginning, I didn't want to believe that it was the Christian God, or that it would be Jesus.
[time=205] It could have been Buddha or anyone.
[time=207] So, as this awakening continued, I began to realize that if there was a God, and that he was, in fact,
[time=217] the creator of my daughter, and my family, and life as I knew it, it would be best to believe in the God who said he rose from the dead.
[time=227] I didn't want to believe in a dead God.
[time=230] I also had a friend that told me a lot of the disappointments that I was feeling in the discouragement.
[time=237] I felt a sense of hopelessness, like there wasn't any point in life.
[time=242] It was just you breathe until you die, and then it's over.
[time=246] She told me that I needed Jesus.
[time=249] Well, I didn't really believe that.
[time=252] But things evolved along enough, and I got discouraged enough that one night, about midnight at my kitchen table,
[time=259] I prayed the most pathetic prayer you could ever pray.
[time=263] It was something like, "I really don't believe you can even hear me, but if you do, then I'm inviting you to come into my heart."
[time=272] And that day, things turned upside down.
[time=277] I was never the same after that.
[time=279] So, with my newfound faith, I slowly became a Christian.
[time=286] I was a Christian right away, but I didn't recognize it.
[time=291] I didn't think that I wanted anything to do with the Bible, or the Church, or any of those Christian things.
[time=297] It was just me and Jesus all day long.
[time=301] Well, about six months into it, I told my husband, "You know, I really think I'd like to have a Bible." He was shocked, but he got me a Bible, and I started reading it, and I was so excited.
[time=317] I was a mother of new children, and I was teaching them the Bible as I learned it.
[time=324] And not long after that, I decided that I wanted to go to church.
[time=327] I thought, "I'd really like to be in the place where these people who think about God, what are they saying?
[time=334] What are they doing?" And so, I wanted to go to church.
[time=338] I had no idea that God had put me on a process to draw me into Himself and to teach me and to transform my thinking.
[time=349] But that's exactly what was happening.
[time=351] So, as God began to grow me up in the Lord, I began to learn a lot of things about Him.
[time=359] But still, life handed me difficulties.
[time=365] A lot of the dysfunction that I came from didn't really follow me, and I'm so thankful for that.
[time=373] But I have had heartache.
[time=375] I've had all kinds of difficulty.
[time=378] Things that God has changed my perspective on, or given me strength, or aided me through it.
[time=386] So, even though I've had a purpose and a plan, it's not like that I've had this easy street.
[time=394] Even now, I mean, there's difficulties that I face every day, but I find Him to be faithful and true, and He helps me.
[time=404] So, my story is a long line of dysfunction.
[time=411] I came from every evil thing.
[time=414] That should have been my legacy.
[time=416] In my family, there was divorce.
[time=419] There was adultery.
[time=421] There were illegitimate children.
[time=424] There were addictions to drugs and alcohol.
[time=429] There was suicide. There was murder.
[time=433] And He has saved me out of all that.
[time=437] And even though my life hasn't been perfect, through the grace of God, He has given me five Christian children.
[time=446] And they walk with God.
[time=448] And He's given me thirteen grandchildren, and all of them are saved, except the youngest.
[time=456] Two. I don't know. We have hope for Him, but He belongs to Corbin, so who knows?
[time=463] So, He has rescued me, and my heart will only sing Jesus.
[time=472] My heart will sing Jesus.
[time=480] My heart will sing no other name.
[time=485] Jesus.
[time=489] My heart will sing in the no other day.
[time=494] Jesus.
[time=498] My heart will sing no other name.
[time=502] Jesus.
[time=505] There is power in the name.
[time=509] Jesus.
[time=512] To break every chain.
[time=519] There is power in the name of Jesus.
[time=543] To break every chain.
[time=562] [MUSIC] All sufficient sacrifice [MUSIC] Feel freely given such a rise [MUSIC] What our redemption heavens gave [MUSIC] Swing wide [MUSIC] We believe [MUSIC] There is power in the name of Jesus [MUSIC] There is healing in the name of Jesus [MUSIC] There is healing in the name of Jesus [MUSIC] To break every chain. Break every chain. Break every chain. [MUSIC] To break every chain. Break every chain. Break every chain. [MUSIC]
[time=653] There is power.
[time=655] There is power in the name of Jesus.
[time=665] We believe.
[time=668] There is an army rising down.
[time=691] [MUSIC - 31 seconds]
[time=737] Hi, my name is Darren McCown, and you're used to seeing me behind the piano, leading music.
[time=743] But this morning, I want to introduce to you a couple, Kyle and Laura.
[time=748] And they are from Revive, Indiana, and they're doing some great things.
[time=753] And so, I'll let them tell you a little bit about what they're doing.
[time=757] So, watch.
[time=759] My name is Kyle Lance Martin, and this is my wife, Laura Martin.
[time=763] And we've been married for almost 14 years, four kids later.
[time=766] Originally, I'm from Middlebury, Indiana outside of Elkhart Goshen, and Laura's from Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[time=772] And we met at Taylor University in upland.
[time=774] It was eight years ago, I had just graduated from Dallas Theological Seminary.
[time=778] And I started to walk in the city of Dallas.
[time=780] And the Lord said, "I want you to pray for revival for Dallas." Specifically, the church.
[time=785] And so I did, for six days, I prayed and I fasted.
[time=788] And the Lord showed me a piece of land near downtown, about 15 blocks outside of downtown.
[time=792] It was sandwiched between Dallas Seminary and Chriswell College.
[time=795] And so, I found out who owned it, and they said, "You can have this land as long as you want." And so, we gathered for 40 days, probably over 200 congregations in Dallas.
[time=803] And we just simply just said, "Lord, wake up the church." And it was in that 2007 time frame that Laura and I really developed a heart for the Lord together
[time=813] in such a way that we'd start calling the body together.
[time=816] And from there, we got invited to Santa Fe, New Mexico.
[time=819] From Santa Fe, we got invited to Sedona, Arizona.
[time=821] And every time we got invited, it was always somebody from that community that had experienced it in the previous city.
[time=828] And so, from Sedona, Arizona, we got invited by a couple who owns a pretzel store, four pretzel stores in Flint, Michigan.
[time=834] And so, they were celebrating their anniversary and they said, "Come to Flint, Michigan." And this cycle just continued.
[time=840] I'd spoken at the Billy Graham Training Center in Asheville, North Carolina.
[time=843] So, we got invited by some folks in Asheville, North Carolina.
[time=846] And again, you just kind of kept saying, "Lord, we don't know what our plan is, except our hardest to see this nation revived."
[time=853] Specifically through the church.
[time=855] The Seattle Times wrote an article about what we were doing in North Carolina and they invited us to Seattle, Washington.
[time=861] And then they went to North Carolina, went to California, went to South Carolina, a large church, a charismatic Lutheran church in Minneapolis.
[time=869] Of about, you know, seven to nine thousand people invited us to the Twin Cities.
[time=874] And so, all of this just, every city's different, it has a different feel, it has a different flavor, which is why, when Paul says to the Jew, you become a Jew.
[time=882] Our role is, is when we come into these cities to help the local church better identify their community, so that you can connect them with the gospel.
[time=890] And for a long, long time, I think evangelism, which is our heartbeat, our heartbeat is to help equip the saints.
[time=897] And when we come into a city, when we're invited, the goal is, is to help the church, first of all, recognize, "Hey, are you in love with Christ?"
[time=904] And then second of all, let's go tell somebody about them.
[time=907] And so, one of our roles as evangelists is to help them understand, "You can do this, we can do this."
[time=914] It's no longer just a Billy Graham thing or a Louis Palau thing or, you know, these great men of God who have gone up and delivered the good news, it's all of our responsibility.
[time=922] And that's what local churches are starting to get excited about, which is why something in Indiana, what we're seeing here in Indiana after eight years, eleven communities, eleven states later, we're seeing something totally different than we've ever seen before.
[time=935] So what we do on a typical day with revive Indiana or whatever city or whatever community we're in is that we believe that prayer is what starts at all.
[time=943] And so we'll pray at seven in the morning.
[time=945] We have a breakfast every day that's always provided.
[time=948] Now, imagine in Elkhart Goshen, we did this for 52 days straight.
[time=952] And you want to talk about the Lord providing manna.
[time=954] I mean, breakfast, lunch, dinner, we always needed it.
[time=956] So we'd eat together at eight o'clock.
[time=957] It was this Acts 2 fellowship coming together.
[time=960] And then at nine o'clock, what we've done is we've mapped out all of the city that we're in.
[time=964] So specifically in Fort Wayne, we've mapped out the entire city.
[time=967] And at nine o'clock, we send teams of four.
[time=969] We have a team leader.
[time=970] We have a driver.
[time=971] And then we have two other people that they go out.
[time=973] And then what we do is we've actually mapped out every single church in all of Fort Wayne as well.
[time=978] And so then we send them out and we say, "Pray over the local church." Because if revival is going to come, it's got to come to the body of Christ.
[time=985] And so we're having people praying over all of the local congregations in Fort Wayne because we don't want...
[time=993] The scripture says, "Wake up and strengthen the things that remain for their about to die." And we want to bless the church.
[time=998] We want to encourage the church to say, "Come on, you can go out and do this." At noon, we meet at a different congregation.
[time=1003] And we testify about all of these fun encounters, fun conversations that we've had.
[time=1007] One o'clock we eat.
[time=1008] And then guess what? Two o'clock we send them back out again.
[time=1011] And we go out and we use just a little simple. This is a simple tool, but it has...
[time=1016] It's the classic. It has five Bible verses.
[time=1018] But what happens is that most Christians want to share the gospel.
[time=1021] They just don't know where to start.
[time=1023] You know, how do we approach people?
[time=1024] So we teach them very simple tools of, "How can you pray with people?" That's the number one approach that we say, "How can we pray with you?" I mean, I just got a call on the way here.
[time=1033] I prayed with a guy in a parking lot a week and a half ago at a local university.
[time=1037] And we're touching base, and he wants me to introduce Christ to his whole family.
[time=1041] That started with a prayer.
[time=1043] And what we do is, is we walk them through five Bible verses.
[time=1046] And the key is, is that we have them read the Scripture verses themselves.
[time=1051] And when you do, it's the faith comes by hearing the Word.
[time=1055] And it's the Holy Spirit speaking to them.
[time=1057] It's not just us just preaching to them.
[time=1059] So in the afternoons, we send out teams.
[time=1061] And in Fort Wayne, the beautiful part is we've been averaging, sending out teams of 70 to 80 teams every morning and every afternoon.
[time=1067] We haven't seen that in any city except Elkhart and Goshan area, and then in the Twin Cities.
[time=1073] And so at night, we come back, we eat at 5.30.
[time=1076] And trust me, you're tired by that.
[time=1078] And so then every night at seven o'clock, we have an evening worship service.
[time=1081] And the whole purpose of the evening worship service is to get you equipped, get you refreshed and say, "Guys, let's do it again tomorrow." And that's what's been happening in Indiana for seven months.
[time=1091] Literally, I've never seen anything like this to the point where people from all over the United States, we had a pastor last week from Hawaii.
[time=1097] He came in.
[time=1098] We've had somebody come in from Australia.
[time=1099] We have pastors come in from Cleveland.
[time=1101] And they're just coming and saying, "What is going on?
[time=1104] And can I take this back to my own congregation?" Just remember the first time that you fell in love with Jesus.
[time=1110] Remember the first time that you had a calling in your life to turn to Him.
[time=1114] And when you do, you will start sensing, "I gotta give this away.
[time=1118] I gotta give this good news away." And Revive Indiana is not done just because corporately the time-revive team is gone.
[time=1124] And in fact, the local team here, there's 30 to 40 local congregations that are taking this baton and carrying it on.
[time=1131] No corporately meet every single month.
[time=1133] They'll meet probably on a regular basis, even in between that monthly basis.
[time=1137] And for more information, they can always go to ReviveIndiana.org.
[time=1140] And they can watch locals doing this, just in case they're a little nervous or a little hesitant.
[time=1146] But really, anybody can jump on board regardless of the timeframe.
[time=1150] Because the cool part about what's been happening is it's the handoff.
[time=1154] It's the people that are saying, "Yes to Jesus." We need people today in local churches that can say, "Out disciple people." We've had over 300 people already matched and paired.
[time=1163] People that we've talked out on the streets to now local people in the church are saying, "I'm gonna walk with them for a whole year." And so we need people doing that every single week.
[time=1172] And if that intrigues anybody, say, "I wanna start discipleing people." Go to ReviveIndiana.org and let us know.
[time=1178] Well, good morning.
[time=1185] If you have your Bible's turn to Hebrews chapter 10,
[time=1191] we're gonna be looking at the confidence-building work of Christ this morning from Hebrews chapter 10.
[time=1198] So let's read Hebrews chapter 10 this morning, starting in verse 19.
[time=1203] "Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus,
[time=1211] by the new and living way that He opened for us through the curtain that is through His flesh, and since we have a great high priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
[time=1232] Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering for He who promised is faithful and let us consider how to stir up one another toward love and good deeds,
[time=1246] not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another and all the more as we see the day drawing near.
[time=1257] Hebrews chapter 10, 19 through 25, would you pray with me?
[time=1263] God, I'm so thankful that Christianity is for the weak
[time=1270] because I feel that weakness.
[time=1273] I feel it right now. I feel it every day.
[time=1276] I feel, and I know that I could not do anything apart from you.
[time=1282] I could not earn a right standing with you.
[time=1287] I could not love my wife and my kids properly without you.
[time=1295] And so this morning, God, I'm so thankful that your grace and your mercy and your support and your love, your conviction,
[time=1306] your Holy Spirit, all of it, is there for me.
[time=1313] God, I pray this morning that you would please help us to see what a great advocate we have in your Son, Jesus, and that that would help us to live a life that points to you, that brings glory to you, and shines a light on Jesus.
[time=1332] And then, God, would you help us just to see the relationship between
[time=1338] what is true in Scripture and what you've called us to do and to be, so that when we read your Word, when each of these people read your Word, that they'd be able to make those connections and ultimately honor and glorify you.
[time=1354] So speak to us and lead us this morning.
[time=1358] We do greatly anticipate, confidently expect the work of your Spirit.
[time=1365] Christ's name that we pray, amen.
[time=1368] So as we move through Hebrews chapter 10 this morning, we'll look at three main points.
[time=1375] First, we'll look at the two beliefs.
[time=1378] Second, we'll see the three behaviors.
[time=1381] And then third, we'll see the relationship between those beliefs and the behaviors.
[time=1386] So first, let's take a look at the two truths or two beliefs or we could say two indicative in Hebrews chapter 10 in the portion of Scripture that we read this morning.
[time=1397] The first one comes in verse 19.
[time=1399] It says this, "That we have confidence to enter into the holy place."
[time=1406] Look at verse 20, "Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that He opened for us through the curtain that is through His flesh." This is the first declarative.
[time=1423] It is a statement of fact.
[time=1426] It is a present reality that all those who have placed their faith and trust in Christ get to enjoy the reality of it and experience the fullness of it.
[time=1437] We have confidence now.
[time=1440] That word confidence is talking about an openness.
[time=1443] It's talking about an assurance.
[time=1445] It's talking about this transparent relationship that we now can have with God as we would enter in to the holy of holies and relate to Him and be with Him.
[time=1459] That wasn't the case in the past.
[time=1462] Let's get a quick historical perspective.
[time=1465] If you have your Bibles, go back to Exodus chapter 20.
[time=1469] In Exodus chapter 20, if you remember the scene, it's when God was giving the Ten Commandments to the people of Israel and He was up on the mountain and there was smoke and there was fire and there was His presence up on the mountain.
[time=1484] In Exodus chapter 20, verse 18, it says this, "And notice just the fear of the people." Now, when all the people saw the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking, they were afraid and they trembled and they stood far off and said to Moses,
[time=1504] "You speak to us and we will listen, but do not let God speak to us lest we die." And Moses said to the people, "Do not fear.
[time=1515] God has come to test you that the fear of Him may be before you and that you may not sin." Notice what's going on here.
[time=1521] The presence of God was on the mountain and the people were basically saying, "I don't know, we don't have any confidence to go up the top of that mountain." Moses, you go up on our behalf and come back and tell us, there was no confidence to be up there.
[time=1538] In Exodus chapter 28, when they were talking about giving the law of Moses and some of the specific examples or specific requirements of how His people, God's people, were to relate to Him.
[time=1551] In Exodus chapter 28, verse 40, it says this, For Aaron's son, you shall make coats and sashes and caps,
[time=1560] you shall make them for glory and beauty, and you shall put them on Aaron your brother and on his sons with him, and shall anoint them and ordain them and consecrate them that they may serve me as priests.
[time=1572] You shall make for them linen undergarments to cover their naked flesh, they shall reach from the hips to the thighs, and they shall be on Aaron and on his sons when they go into the tent of meeting, or when they come near the altar to minister in the holy place, lest they bear guilt and die.
[time=1591] This was not just a happenstance circumstance.
[time=1596] This was not just something they were, you know, just had to prepare a little bit for in order to minister before God and to go into the holy place.
[time=1604] This was something that had dire consequences, that they could potentially go into the holy place, and it was the high priest one time a year, and that he could potentially die in the presence of God.
[time=1622] Leviticus 16, again, just to make the point.
[time=1627] Leviticus chapter 16, 1 through 6, it says this, "The Lord spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, and they drew near before the Lord, and they died.
[time=1639] And the Lord said to Moses, "Tell Aaron your brother not to come at any time into the holy place before the mercy seat that is on the ark, so that he may not die.
[time=1648] For I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat, but in this way, Aaron shall come into the holy place with a bowl from the herd for a sin offering
[time=1657] and a ram for a burnt offering.
[time=1659] He shall put on the holy linen coat and shall have the linen undergarment on his body.
[time=1664] He shall tie the linen sash around his waist and wear the linen turban.
[time=1668] These are the holy garments.
[time=1670] He shall bathe his body in water and then put them on, and he shall take them from the congregation of the people of Israel.
[time=1676] Two male goats for a sin offering, one ram for a burnt offering.
[time=1680] Aaron shall offer the bowl as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house." You see what was going on in this Old Testament was there was a holy place where the high priest would go into once a year.
[time=1696] And when he went into there was specific requirements on how he was supposed to prepare and how he was supposed to dress, so that he could go in and he could make an offering first for himself and then for the whole nation.
[time=1711] And we don't get this from Scripture, but we get this from historical literature.
[time=1715] What they used to do is they actually would tie a rope around the high priest's ankle,
[time=1721] and that rope would come back and he would walk into the holy place with his offerings in hopes that he had prepared well.
[time=1729] And yet the rope was there just in case it didn't go well so that they could pull him out.
[time=1736] There was no confidence on behalf of the people to enter into the very presence of God.
[time=1747] There was none. There was no openness. But now what Hebrews tells us is this.
[time=1753] Now there is a new and living way that we have confidence to go into the very presence
[time=1761] of the Most High God. You have confidence if you're in Christ today to be with him.
[time=1772] To talk with him. To sit with him.
[time=1778] To be in his presence only though because of the blood of Jesus.
[time=1783] We look at verse 20, it tells us that this confidence comes because of a new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain that is through the flesh of Jesus.
[time=1794] Remember when Jesus died and the curtain that blocked the holy of holies where God's
[time=1800] was was torn into signifying the fact that now things were different.
[time=1806] That we could enter in through the flesh or the veil that is Jesus in his work at Calvary.
[time=1814] His sacrifice has made you clean so that you can be in the very presence of God without
[time=1821] tunic, without the blood of an animal year by year and without dying.
[time=1832] We have confidence to enter into the holy place into the presence of God.
[time=1838] There is a second reality, a second declarative that comes in verse 22, verse 21, sorry.
[time=1845] And since we have a great high priest over the house of God, the second reality is this
[time=1851] this morning, if you know Christ, you have a great high priest who is ministering on your
[time=1857] behalf right now at the very right hand of the Most High God.
[time=1863] It is Jesus our great high priest.
[time=1868] Historical perspective again, the high priesthood or the priesthood was established by God.
[time=1873] And only once a year would that priest be able to go into the holies of holies, the very
[time=1880] presence of God.
[time=1881] He would go in once a year and every year he would have to go in and offer sacrifice.
[time=1887] And know this, that this high priest had to offer a sacrifice, as we've already said, first for himself because he was not perfect.
[time=1896] And then for the sins of the people.
[time=1900] But now, now we only have one high priest, the great high priest.
[time=1907] He doesn't change.
[time=1908] He's the same forever into eternity.
[time=1912] He is Jesus, the great high priest.
[time=1914] And we can go back in Hebrews chapter 10.
[time=1917] And we can see in verse 1 it says this, "For since the law has but a shadow of the good
[time=1923] things to come, instead of the true form of these realities, it can never by the same sacrifice that are continually offered every year make perfect those who draw near.
[time=1934] There wasn't an ability in the old sacrificial system to justify anyone, to make them perfect
[time=1940] before God.
[time=1942] But now it says this, otherwise they would not have ceased to be offered since the worshipers,
[time=1948] having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sin.
[time=1952] But in these sacrifices, there's a reminder of sin year after year, for it's impossible
[time=1958] for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
[time=1962] And then it goes in to talk about the priesthood of Christ, that he did not have to offer
[time=1968] sacrifice for his own sin, and that he does not have to go year after year.
[time=1973] He's there presently and permanently ministering on your behalf.
[time=1981] One sacrifice, his sacrifice at Calvary, once and for all, a pure and spotless lamb, the
[time=1992] lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.
[time=1998] We have a great high priest this morning who's at the very throne room of God in his presence
[time=2005] at his right hand, ministering on your behalf.
[time=2010] 1 John chapter 2, 1, says this.
[time=2014] It says, "I write these things to you that you may not sin, but if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
[time=2025] And he also is the propitiation for our sins.
[time=2028] Not only is he our advocate at the right hand, but he's also the propitiation, which
[time=2034] means he's the one who took the full blunt of God's wrath that you and I deserve.
[time=2040] And so our high priest is at the right hand.
[time=2043] He's our advocate.
[time=2044] He's ministering to us.
[time=2046] And he confesses and admits that we are guilty.
[time=2049] And yet at the same time, he says, "I've taken their condemnation." It's on me, Father.
[time=2057] That's our high priest.
[time=2059] He's there.
[time=2060] He's not going anywhere.
[time=2062] He's ministering on our behalf.
[time=2065] These two beliefs or these two declaratives reveal for us truth that can never change.
[time=2072] They're present realities that will never go away.
[time=2075] And they lead to three behaviors.
[time=2078] The first one comes in verse 22.
[time=2080] So we saw our two beliefs.
[time=2082] Now we're going to look at these three behaviors.
[time=2085] The first one comes in verse 22, "Let us draw near with a true heart full assurance of faith
[time=2092] with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water."
[time=2099] Drawing near.
[time=2102] Just this idea that the psalmist had said before, "That your nearness, O God, is my good.
[time=2107] To be in your presence, there is no better place to be.
[time=2112] I was created for you and to worship you.
[time=2115] And to be in your presence is the best place." And so what the writer of Hebrews is saying is this, "We should individually draw near to
[time=2125] God.
[time=2126] There is no other place in which you will find what you truly need." Think of the opposite of this dry near.
[time=2132] It's the idea of running away from God.
[time=2135] What we would say is this, that it's finding your satisfaction and joy in someone else or some other thing or somewhere else.
[time=2143] It comes down to just idolatry, that some other person, relationship thing, bank account,
[time=2151] whatever it may be, that that becomes your God.
[time=2156] In place of the true God, it's running away from Him.
[time=2160] And so drawing near allows us, or what drawing near does for us, or how we do that is to forsake
[time=2167] everything else, to understand that those things might be good in and of themselves.
[time=2172] And they might be good gifts from God, but they were never meant to replace Him because they can never do what only He can do.
[time=2182] Your greatest need is to be made right with God.
[time=2185] Your greatest joy is to be in His presence.
[time=2188] Your greatest fulfillment is to be found in Him.
[time=2190] Your greatest peace is to find rest in Him.
[time=2193] Your greatest hope is to go through eternity with Him.
[time=2198] So drawing near, simply taking some time every day to be with Him, to pray to Him, to confess
[time=2213] your sin, to listen to Him, reading God's Word.
[time=2222] It's drawing near to the Father.
[time=2230] Let us draw near.
[time=2232] It's the first behavior.
[time=2234] The second behavior comes in verse 23.
[time=2237] It says this, "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised
[time=2244] is faithful." Again, confession is just a word that means to speak the same thing.
[time=2249] It's a compound word in the Greek, "hama-laguetto." "Hama" means to say the same thing.
[time=2254] "Hama" means the same, and "lego" means to say.
[time=2257] And so you put them together.
[time=2258] It's to say the same thing about a certain topic.
[time=2262] So I'm going to say the same thing that God says about my sin.
[time=2267] I'm going to confess it and say that yes, you're right.
[time=2270] It is a great offense before you.
[time=2272] I have transgressed against your law.
[time=2275] It's a confession.
[time=2276] Here it's specifically talking about a confession or holding fast the confession of our hope in Christ.
[time=2287] To hold fast, to not lose our grip on what we believe about the person and work of Christ.
[time=2298] We don't have time to go there.
[time=2300] But in 2 Timothy 1, it's kind of Paul's farewell song to his young son Timothy in the faith.
[time=2307] And there in that first chapter, oh, he urges him.
[time=2310] He implores him.
[time=2312] He says, "Timothy, don't lose your grip on the gospel." And what this is saying here is that same idea.
[time=2322] The writer of the Hebrews is saying, "Let us hold fast.
[time=2326] Let's not loosen our grip on the center of Christianity." And that center is the person and work of Christ for the glory of God.
[time=2338] Oh, let's not lose our grasp on the gospel.
[time=2342] But not only is it that hope, but it says there, the confession of our hope without wavering.
[time=2347] I think it's also talking about the second coming of Christ.
[time=2352] And how easy it is to begin to doubt, and we'll talk about this in a minute, but what this is talking about is again to understand, to hold fast, that there is a hope that Jesus is coming back again.
[time=2365] And that he will take his own, and we will be with him.
[time=2369] And there will be a judgment.
[time=2372] Second Peter, chapter three, Peter is speaking to them.
[time=2376] He reminds them of what the prophets talked about, and he says that there will be scoffers that will come,
[time=2382] that will say, "Where is the hope of his coming?" Because we don't see anything different.
[time=2388] It's been years upon years, and we don't see him coming.
[time=2393] And yet Peter says to them, he says, "Oh, don't worry, be patient."
[time=2400] And that's where he says that a day with the Lord is as a thousand years.
[time=2406] He's coming, and he will judge, and he will take his own to be with him.
[time=2414] And so the writer of Hebrews says, "Let us hold fast that confession, the confession of our hope."
[time=2421] The third is this, it's in verse 24.
[time=2425] And you can see the repetition, right?
[time=2428] Twenty-two, let us draw near.
[time=2430] Twenty-three, let us hold fast.
[time=2432] Twenty-four, let us consider how to stir one another up toward love and good works,
[time=2438] not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another all the more as you see the day drawing near.
[time=2446] What this is talking about is to be the church of God together.
[time=2450] That word consider and encourage go along to say this, that we as a group of people need to be perceptive,
[time=2458] that we need to come alongside of one another, and minister to one another.
[time=2466] We need to be the body of Christ together, so that we would be perceptive to know when somebody needs help,
[time=2475] to know when they need an encouraging word, to know when they need somebody to come, and to bring truth to them and say, "Hey, you're not lining up here, and I want God's best for you."
[time=2487] And so I'm bringing God's truth to remind you of His truth in your life.
[time=2493] And on the flip side of that, it's being open to share.
[time=2500] That we would be perceptive even of our own hearts when we know that we need some help,
[time=2506] that we would be vulnerable with one another, and say, "Hey, would you pray with me?" Or, "Hey, I'm struggling in this way. Could you please help me with this?" It's the body of Christ caring for one another.
[time=2522] This idea of considering how to stir one another up, and not neglecting, meeting,
[time=2528] and really encouraging one another is a community of believers who are exhibiting great humility.
[time=2540] Let us consider how to stir one another up.
[time=2545] These three behaviors, they're actually imperatives, they're commands.
[time=2551] These three behaviors show us how to best relate to God, how to relate to ourselves and to each other.
[time=2563] Now let's take a look in our last few moments how these relate, how these beliefs relate to our behaviors.
[time=2573] So we've seen these two truths, these two beliefs about who Christ is and what He's done,
[time=2580] and we've seen these three commands or these three behaviors.
[time=2585] Now how do they relate together?
[time=2588] Well, let's take a look at that first one, drawing near that behavior.
[time=2594] You know what the temptation that I face, that I'm sure you face in drawing near?
[time=2601] It's this.
[time=2604] Yeah, I know I'm supposed to draw near, but you don't know what I did today.
[time=2611] You don't know how ugly I really am.
[time=2617] And maybe it's not, you don't know what I did today, maybe it's, I can't draw near.
[time=2623] You don't know what I did 15 years ago.
[time=2628] We've all got baggage that Satan uses to say you can't go, you can't sit with your Heavenly Father.
[time=2640] You can't draw near, and I fear that for many of you this morning it's been years.
[time=2649] It's been too long, way too long for you when you've had an intimate time with your Heavenly Father.
[time=2660] But do you see how the belief, the belief that we talked about shatters those fears?
[time=2668] You know, that drawing near, it's the thought that I just have to clean myself up first before I can come into the presence of God.
[time=2677] I put confidence in myself, but what we need to do, the answer comes from the belief that we've already looked at.
[time=2684] Drawing near is not based upon what I have done or what I could not have done.
[time=2690] It's based upon what Christ has done and that He is my High Priest.
[time=2697] It's based upon the fact that we have confidence to enter in, not because of what we've done.
[time=2706] And not because of how clean we think we might be, but we have confidence because this new and living way that He opened for us through the curtain that is the flesh of Jesus Christ
[time=2718] as He hung on the cross at Calvary to pay the penalty for what we did today.
[time=2726] To take away the shame and the guilt and the condemnation that happened 15 years ago.
[time=2733] All of that has taken away in Him so that now I have confidence to sit with my Heavenly Father.
[time=2746] And I have confidence to confess my sin because I know I have a High Priest that says I've taken that for Him.
[time=2756] Do you see how that behavior has to be informed by the belief of who Christ is and what He's done?
[time=2768] There's a second one, holding fast.
[time=2772] Holding fast is what we believe.
[time=2775] It sounds easy, but in the midst of our culture, in the midst of our days, and in the midst of this world in which there's so many things vying for our time, there are times when we are tempted to think, is this really true?
[time=2792] Is this Christianity thing real?
[time=2795] You know, it's so intangible.
[time=2797] And sometimes it can just feel really kooky sometimes, right?
[time=2802] I mean, if you're honest with yourself, right?
[time=2805] I mean, sometimes you just feel like you're praying to the ceiling.
[time=2808] Like, this is really intangible.
[time=2810] It's really weird sometimes.
[time=2815] The answer comes back to looking at what is tangible.
[time=2821] What has happened in the past that is historical, specifically the beliefs here,
[time=2827] regarding the death and resurrection of Christ, that He actually Jesus was a person
[time=2834] that walked through this earth some 2,000 years ago, that He was on a cross,
[time=2840] that it's historically reliable, and that He did rise from the dead.
[time=2845] There is evidence toward that.
[time=2848] It is tangible.
[time=2850] And so as we think about those truths, those historical realities,
[time=2856] the greatest evidence of God's continued support to help us hold fast is His work.
[time=2862] Romans 8, 32 says this, "He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all,
[time=2868] how will He not also freely give us all things in Him?
[time=2872] If God went to such an extent to slay His Son to save us, what would ever make us think that He's going to give up on us?"
[time=2882] And so the answer to holding fast, when we're tempted not to believe
[time=2888] or to be discouraged or to feel weird about it all, is to go back to the work of Christ.
[time=2896] Third, that third behavior, let us consider how to stir one another up.
[time=2905] That idea of just knowing and helping each other be the body of Christ.
[time=2910] The temptation is this, number one is I don't want to get involved in your life because I don't want to get messy and it's going to take time and it's going to take effort.
[time=2919] And I've got other things that I want to do.
[time=2922] Or maybe it's the flip side.
[time=2924] I don't want anyone to know what I'm really experiencing.
[time=2932] Whatever side it is, there's a temptation there that would say,
[time=2938] "I just don't want to bring this to the light. I don't want to get involved.
[time=2941] It's too much work. It's too much hassle." And so instead, I'll just stay in my little silo and I'll say, "Hello to you.
[time=2951] Hey, great to see you. Hope you're doing great, but I'm still just in my silo.
[time=2958] I'm not going to get out of it unless I really start to believe the truth
[time=2964] about who Christ is and what He's done and that we would now, because of that belief,
[time=2970] see each other as clothed in the righteousness of Christ.
[time=2975] That each of us needs 100% of Jesus, 100% of the time.
[time=2982] That there's not one person in this room who somehow has more grace or more favor with God because they're walking with Him better.
[time=2992] That we all have issues and that we all need each other and that we can actually look at each other
[time=3002] without judging but seeing one another, robed, clothed, covered in the robe of Christ's righteousness.
[time=3017] See how that changes things? Changes my behavior.
[time=3023] Maybe not all the time, right? It's never easy to obey,
[time=3029] but it's never more easy to obey than when breathing deeply the truth of who Christ is and what He's done.
[time=3039] Well, in conclusion, general and specific, general, first of all,
[time=3049] a quick warning about wrong behavior.
[time=3053] Look where the writer of Hebrews goes after our passage in verse 25.
[time=3060] He says this, "For if we go on sinning deliberately, after receiving the knowledge of the truth,
[time=3069] there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.
[time=3078] Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses." That was an Old Testament thing, but now he comes New Testament.
[time=3086] How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God
[time=3092] and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which He was sanctified and has outraged the spirit of grace?
[time=3103] There's a lot in there, but let me just say this quickly.
[time=3109] If you go on deliberately sinning, your belief in who Christ is and what He's done
[time=3119] is probably not there, right?
[time=3122] I mean, belief determines your behavior.
[time=3125] And so if those behaviors are consistently and deliberately outside of God's good for you,
[time=3133] then that belief is probably not there.
[time=3137] That doesn't mean 100% of the time.
[time=3140] It's not talking about perfection for those who know Christ, but it's an attitude about sin
[time=3146] that either, check this out, that either embraces repentance or never repents at all.
[time=3156] Repentance is a beautiful thing that I try to do as often as I can, right?
[time=3162] It just means turning from my sin, confessing it as sin, and turning back to follow God's commands
[time=3170] and embracing the behavior that I know is good for me and ultimately for His honor.
[time=3177] Specifically, some of you this morning have not spent intimate time with God,
[time=3186] your Heavenly Father, in a long time.
[time=3192] I just encourage you to look to Christ, to have confidence to know that you can be with Him,
[time=3203] you can pray with Him, you can listen to Him, you can read your word, you can have intimacy
[time=3209] with our Creator God, our Heavenly Father, and I encourage you this week.
[time=3215] You may not even know what to do, but just get alone and be honest with God.
[time=3225] God, I don't know what to do in this 15 minutes.
[time=3230] I don't know what to do in this 5 minutes, but I want to be with you.
[time=3236] And I know that Christ has made it possible.
[time=3240] Would you commit to do that this week?
[time=3243] Would you commit to do that later today?
[time=3246] Your Heavenly Father wants to be with you.
[time=3249] Secondly, some of you are doubting the reality of Christianity.
[time=3255] I just encourage you to know the historical reality of the death and resurrection of Christ
[time=3262] is the greatest evidence that God's way is real and true,
[time=3268] and there is no other message like the grace of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[time=3273] There's no other religion, there's no other system that functions this way
[time=3280] because it came from the mind and the heart of God to us.
[time=3283] And I just encourage you to embrace it and hold fast to it this morning.
[time=3287] Finally, some of you are hiding and you're not wanting to reveal yourself.
[time=3295] Others of you this morning are thinking that you don't need help, and still others are not willing to enter into someone else's mess.
[time=3307] Can I just encourage you?
[time=3312] We need each other.
[time=3315] We need to be vulnerable.
[time=3318] And we need to see each other as clothed in the righteousness of Christ so that judgment and fear can just dissipate.
[time=3326] And true love and care and concern for one another can be at the forefront.
[time=3335] As we look through these things, you can decide in your heart and your mind that you're just going to try to do better at this.
[time=3343] I'm just going to try to be better this week.
[time=3347] Or you can look to Jesus this morning.
[time=3351] Follow His example.
[time=3354] He's our model, right?
[time=3356] I think of Him in the New Testament time and time again.
[time=3359] You'll read where He slipped away to spend some time with His Father.
[time=3365] Jesus drew near to the Father.
[time=3369] Not only that, He held fast to His confession, how difficult must that have been in the Garden of Gethsemane, knowing what was in store for Him the very next morning.
[time=3381] And yet as He struggled in that garden and as He was authentic and real, He held fast to the hope that He had, the hope that He would be reunited with the Father when He was raised from the dead.
[time=3396] Jesus held fast in the midst of great suffering and trial.
[time=3402] And Jesus entered into relationship with the disciples
[time=3410] to encourage them, support them, but not only that, every single day He enters into My mess and into Your mess.
[time=3421] I don't know why.
[time=3424] He doesn't have any mess, right?
[time=3426] There's no sin in Him.
[time=3429] And yet constantly, consistently with great patience and love and care and sometimes conviction and sometimes punishment, He graciously comes in and He helps us.
[time=3446] And so this morning I just ask you to look to Him so that through His model and by His power that you would be a people that have confidence in His work, that leads to behavior, that draws near, that holds fast,
[time=3466] and that considers how to be the body of Christ together.
[time=3470] May Christ's work build your confidence in Him this morning for the good of us all and the praise of our great God's name.
[time=3479] I thank you this morning.
[time=3482] God, we love you, but we only love you because you have first loved us.
[time=3487] Lord, thank You for Your Word.
[time=3489] Lord, help us to understand and to see those connections between what we know to be true and how we're supposed to respond.
[time=3497] And would You help us all to take a couple steps along this way of understanding Your Word and interpreting it correctly and to the best of our ability?
[time=3508] Would Your Spirit help us in that realm?
[time=3511] And God, would You just build our confidence this morning into these amazing realities that we have confidence to enter into the very holy place of You, Father,
[time=3526] and that we have a great high praise to His ministry on our behalf.
[time=3530] We praise You this morning. Christ's name, we pray. Amen.
