[time=468] >> Good morning, dear friends.
[time=469] How are you?
[time=470] It's great to be at Black Hawk.
[time=471] Dare a nice job on the music, thank you for that.
[time=474] A lot of vertical stuff today.
[time=476] I don't know if you think about songs.
[time=478] I have to think about music a lot.
[time=480] I'm going to read a couple of poems to you today.
[time=484] And some music is horizontal where we speak to each other and we encourage each other in the faith.
[time=490] And then some of them are very sung prayers that connect us in a very vertical way.
[time=497] And today was a lot of vertical, which is kind of my favorite to be honest with you because I need to connect that direction.
[time=504] Nothing against you.
[time=505] I'd like to connect and we'll talk about that in a minute.
[time=507] But I need to get going.
[time=509] I got more to say than I have time to say and hopefully some really encouraging things with you.
[time=516] In 2001, Jim Collins wrote a best-selling book called "From Good to Great."
[time=522] In that book, Collins, I have not read the book.
[time=526] Let me give that disclaimer.
[time=527] I read an article.
[time=528] I read the cliff notes.
[time=529] I don't know if that helps.
[time=530] I got the gist of it.
[time=532] Most books I read would have been better articles.
[time=535] And when I'm reading that, have you had that experience?
[time=537] And that would have been a great article.
[time=539] It wasn't that good of a book.
[time=541] But I'm not saying this one, isn't it?
[time=543] I haven't read the book.
[time=544] In the book, he surveyed 1,435 companies and examined 40 years of their business history.
[time=554] And out of 1,435 companies, he identified 11.
[time=560] I don't have that many fingers, so I'll put the two ones up together.
[time=565] He filed on the drift.
[time=566] 11 of them were what he would call companies that went from good to great.
[time=571] He then analyzed what caused them to go to good to great and so on.
[time=575] And it's pretty fascinating stuff, eggs and flywheels and things of that nature that he talks about.
[time=582] Here's my Bible.
[time=584] It has 1,611 pages in it.
[time=587] I have surveyed it.
[time=590] And here's what I have found out.
[time=592] There is a great God revealed in it who makes wicked people good.
[time=600] So we're not going to talk about going from good to great because we already start out wicked.
[time=606] But what we're going to talk about is the great God who made wicked people good.
[time=611] So we're going to go from great to good today.
[time=616] You guys with me on that?
[time=619] And I want to give you one of those stories.
[time=622] They're everywhere.
[time=623] They're not hard to find throughout the Old Testament and New Testament in the midst of the tragedy,
[time=629] in the midst of death, in the midst of all these things.
[time=632] Here is this great God loving his created people in such a way to make them good.
[time=640] I want to share one of those stories with you today.
[time=642] And I'm going to ask you to do me a favor.
[time=644] Will you stand?
[time=645] We're going to read God's word out loud.
[time=647] When Ezra found the Bible, they stood for hours as he read it.
[time=653] We are in Hebrews chapter 10 verses 19 to 25.
[time=658] A really wonderful passage from great to good.
[time=662] Since therefore, brethren, we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus.
[time=667] By a new and living way which he inaugurated for us through the veil, that is his flesh.
[time=674] And since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near with the sincere heart
[time=682] and full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
[time=690] Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering for he who promised is faithful.
[time=698] And let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our own assembling together as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day drawing near.
[time=715] Would you please? Our great God, we bow before you because we need a touch of your hand.
[time=725] We have tried to verbalize our adoration of you this morning.
[time=731] It is the cry of our hearts that you are awesome.
[time=735] And it is the cry of our hearts that we need you because we aren't.
[time=741] And we beg you during these next moments as we contemplate your revelation of yourself
[time=747] that you would speak to our souls and that our souls would be receptive to what your spirit says.
[time=754] Oh Father, give us ears to hear exactly what you want to say to us.
[time=761] And Lord, I'm going to have the audacity to ask you to not let us leave this place the way we came.
[time=768] Mold and shape and change our very lives.
[time=773] If there's a person in this room, Father, who's never figured out faith, open their hearts to it this morning.
[time=781] And let this place be the 301st, 4th, 5th, salvation in our city this week.
[time=791] Help us to admire you more deeply, to trust you more completely.
[time=797] And Lord, help me to speak well on your behalf, for you know all of my frailties.
[time=804] Amen. Please be seated.
[time=811] Our passage starts out with the great.
[time=814] The great is Jesus.
[time=816] In verse 20, he is called, or verse 21, excuse me, he is called the great high priest over the household of God.
[time=824] Now I'm breaking into a long argument in the book of Hebrews and I need to go back and pick up some of the pieces.
[time=830] One of the difficulties about being the guest speaker is it's hard to do things in the context in which they're stated.
[time=837] But his greatness is on display throughout this book by his position.
[time=843] And his position is proclaimed before us, the great priest over the house of God.
[time=850] And so the great one is Christ and it is his position that puts his greatness on display.
[time=857] I want to go back and give you five comparisons that the writer of Hebrews brings to us from the very first verse of this letter.
[time=866] So you go to Hebrews chapter 1, verse 1, right back at the beginning.
[time=870] I'm going to go quickly through them.
[time=872] There may be more comparisons, but let me give you five.
[time=875] Remember, he's writing to a group of converted Jewish believers.
[time=880] They're brand new in their faith and Christianity is the new thing on the block.
[time=885] They are setting aside their Judaism.
[time=889] Let me say that better.
[time=891] They are recognizing the fulfillment of their Judaism in the Messiah Jesus.
[time=897] That belief system is under attack at a very high level.
[time=903] Mommy is not happy that her son is a follower of Jesus.
[time=907] Grandma is not happy that you get the idea.
[time=911] The husband is not happy that his wife is not following Christ.
[time=917] Pressure is being placed upon faith and what are we going to find to be true about faith when pressure gets pushed on it.
[time=926] But first, he's going to say why you should have faith.
[time=936] In these last days, he's spoken to us in his son.
[time=941] And his son is the one he's made the air of all things.
[time=944] And his son is through whom he made the whole earth.
[time=947] And his son is the exact radiance of his glory.
[time=950] He's the exact representation.
[time=952] You get the feel compared to the prophets.
[time=955] Here's the first comparison.
[time=956] Compared to the prophets of old, Jesus is way greater.
[time=962] That's the comparison.
[time=963] The book of Hebrews is a bunch of comparisons of Christ to the Jewish heroes and proclaiming him better than every single one.
[time=971] So here we have in the very first three verses, here are these prophets.
[time=974] They were the mouthpiece of God.
[time=976] And they spoke for him.
[time=977] Jesus is way better than him.
[time=980] Verse 4 to 14 of chapter 1, he picks up angels.
[time=984] In verse 4, he says, he became much better than the angels.
[time=987] He inherited a much more excellent name than them.
[time=990] So second comparison are the angelic forces.
[time=993] And Jesus is greater than them.
[time=998] You think about all the things angels did in the Old Testament to say that Christ was greater than the angels that shut lions' mouths and the angels that guarded cities
[time=1008] and the angels that spoke to Abraham and all these angels.
[time=1013] He's greater than them.
[time=1016] What you have in the book of Hebrews is an apology for the greatness of Christ.
[time=1020] To a group of Jewish converts trying to hold them in place because they're starting to waver on whether they really believe he's that good.
[time=1032] We could probably take the whole Jewish thing out and think about America right there, couldn't we?
[time=1038] Our country used to believe Jesus was great.
[time=1042] And now it despises us as followers of him.
[time=1046] I'll get to that in a moment.
[time=1048] Third comparison, chapter 3, verses 1 to 6, he's greater than Moses.
[time=1053] Just a couple verses out of there, verse 5, he says, Moses was faithful in all his house as a servant for testimony of these things which were spoken later.
[time=1061] But Christ was faithful as his son over his house, whose house we are.
[time=1066] He's greater than Moses. There was no greater prophet and spokesman.
[time=1070] No one had face-to-face meetings with God like Moses.
[time=1073] No one's shown the glory of God like Moses and Jesus is greater than him.
[time=1079] Number 4, he was greater than the Aaronic Priest to chapter 7, verse 11, all the way to chapter 8, verse 3.
[time=1086] Just a couple of verses, 7, 28, says, "The law appoints men as high priests who are weak.
[time=1094] But the word of the oath which came after the law points a son made perfect forever."
[time=1100] Here's the main point, he says, chapter 8, verse 1, "In which has been said as this, we have such a high priest."
[time=1111] He's taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens, a minister in the sanctuary in the true tabernacle with the Lord pitched, not man.
[time=1121] That's our Jesus.
[time=1124] He's greater than the entire priesthood.
[time=1127] One last one.
[time=1129] Number 5, he's greater than the Old Testament sacrificial system.
[time=1133] Chapter 10, really chapter 9 also, but verses 1 to 18, and I want to read especially verses 11 to 14 to you.
[time=1141] It says this, "Every priest stands daily, ministering, offering time after time the same sacrifices which can never take away sins.
[time=1153] But he, having offered one sacrifice for sins at all times, sat down at the right hand of God waiting for that time onward
[time=1161] when his enemies would be made a footstool for his feet, he." Verse 14, "And for by one offering he's perfected for all times those who are sanctified."
[time=1172] This is a great Savior, isn't it?
[time=1176] This Savior is so great that there's no Jewish hero that compares.
[time=1182] That's the argument of the book of Hebrews.
[time=1191] The Bible presents Jesus not as one of the good ones.
[time=1195] The Bible presents Jesus as the only great one.
[time=1202] Now, there might be a bunch of critics and skeptics in the room.
[time=1209] Thanks for coming to church.
[time=1211] I love it when critics and skeptics come to church.
[time=1214] It gives you more ammunition to criticize and be skeptical about.
[time=1223] And I will make this admission.
[time=1226] We deserve it.
[time=1228] We deserve to be criticized and based on our behavior as followers of Christ, you deserve to be skeptical.
[time=1236] But in your skepticism and in your criticism, can I ask you to do one thing?
[time=1242] Think about whether you can be skeptical and critical about Jesus.
[time=1248] His followers were pretty inept.
[time=1253] The world still is attractive to us.
[time=1256] We still get all greedy because we love money.
[time=1263] We still get all lustful because we love sex.
[time=1266] We still get all arrogant because we love ourselves.
[time=1270] We're messy.
[time=1275] And that's a sad thing because Jesus is great.
[time=1279] And the world deserves his followers to reflect his greatness with their goodness.
[time=1285] I'll get to that in a minute.
[time=1289] But I just wanted to say to you critics out there, when you think about criticizing us in the church,
[time=1295] there's 40-11 denominations.
[time=1299] There's actually fewer now.
[time=1301] Everybody's a community.
[time=1303] Have you noticed there are no more denominations?
[time=1305] I'm at black.
[time=1307] Sorry.
[time=1311] Let us pray.
[time=1314] I ask God to help me not be an idiot this morning, and he just, it is such over time work for him.
[time=1322] People come to our church to see how far I will drive the car in the ditch.
[time=1327] And they go, "There he goes.
[time=1330] I don't think he's going to get out this week." I apologize.
[time=1338] Anyhow, we're a mess.
[time=1340] We're divided.
[time=1341] Jesus died to unite us and we're all fractured and splintered and all these things.
[time=1345] And our church isn't any better than any other church.
[time=1348] We hold things that we think are dear.
[time=1350] Maybe they're not as dear as we think they are, I don't know.
[time=1356] But when you open the Bible and you look at Jesus, all you come away from is, that's one great Savior.
[time=1363] If I was ever going to have someone pay the price for my sins, that'd be the one I choose.
[time=1368] That's a lot better than that chubby guy over there in the east doing this all the time sitting around.
[time=1376] By the way, let me tell you a Buddhist story.
[time=1381] I was in Thailand about a year ago.
[time=1384] No, wait a minute.
[time=1385] No, this was, sorry, I get confused.
[time=1388] I was in three places.
[time=1389] It was Thailand.
[time=1390] We were in this temple in a town called Chiang Mai.
[time=1393] It was a big Buddhist place.
[time=1395] And Buddha was in there.
[time=1396] And he was sitting.
[time=1397] We went in.
[time=1398] He got to take his shoes off.
[time=1399] We went in the Buddhist temple.
[time=1400] And he's sitting there with his hand up.
[time=1402] I don't know what that means.
[time=1403] But the story goes, the legend of this particular Buddha was that there were people in conflict.
[time=1409] These cities were in conflict.
[time=1411] And Buddha showed up and did this.
[time=1415] And he set it to peace.
[time=1417] Stop.
[time=1418] In the temple was a rope, a string that was going back and forth.
[time=1423] It would have covered the entire temple back and forth.
[time=1426] And when you walked in the door, you could, and it was attached to his hand.
[time=1431] And you could buy a little piece of paper thingy and write your problem on it.
[time=1439] And they would hang it with a clothespin on this string.
[time=1442] They were all over the place.
[time=1444] And you got to receive his piece through his hand attached to that offering of yours attached
[time=1451] by a clothespin to a string to his hand, brought you his piece.
[time=1458] And I'm going.
[time=1459] I'd rather have the cross.
[time=1461] Thank you very much.
[time=1466] I don't know about you.
[time=1467] I don't want to pick on the Buddhist side.
[time=1470] It might be one in the room, but it's kind of a lame savior compared to a guy who came and died for your sin, isn't it?
[time=1478] See how great Jesus is.
[time=1484] And that greatness, that greatness, ought to be reflected through us as his people.
[time=1495] Let me go to the next one.
[time=1496] His greatness is on display not only because of his position, and I'm a guy who likes to alliterate because we think as pastors, that helps you remember even though you throw the notes away later, because of his performance.
[time=1509] You go back to verse 19, "Since brethren, we have a confidence in the holy place by the
[time=1515] blood of Jesus.
[time=1517] By the sacrifice of Christ, a new and living way which he inaugurated for us through his veil, that is his flesh.
[time=1525] Your savior, this great one who had the power to never die, let himself be killed so that
[time=1533] he could have the ability to never die and always live."
[time=1539] And so by the blood of Christ and the veil of his flesh torn asunder so that we might
[time=1547] know him, the perfect sacrifice of Christ gives us access to God, and we enter, you'll
[time=1553] notice in verse 19, with confidence that is we have the authority to be there.
[time=1560] Our church isn't that big, so we don't have these, but I bet some of you work in a corporate world where you've got a little badgy thingy that says you belong, right?
[time=1570] And you hold it up to the root to do and let you in the door, and depending what's on your badge, that's how many doors you get to go inside.
[time=1579] We sang a song this morning, I don't remember what the name of it was, but we sang a song that we couldn't get to heaven on our own.
[time=1586] We needed Christ to be our badge, and when we get there, we just bring the badge up and we put it up to the little doohickey, we're in!
[time=1597] We have it now.
[time=1598] The text doesn't say we get it later.
[time=1602] You have access to the very throne of God now.
[time=1608] It's not something that we just will receive at the end, we'll get to that too.
[time=1614] We will get it at the end, but we get to taste it now, and we have the authority because we have the proper badge to get us where we're supposed to go.
[time=1623] You'll notice in the text it says, "He's brought a new and living way which he inaugurated for us," in verse 20.
[time=1629] That is, he started something, and when the writer of Hebrews wrote this, the word translated new would be something that was recent.
[time=1636] It was a brand new thing for the Jews who had been sacrificing goats and lambs and pigeons
[time=1643] and bulls, they have to really wrap their mind around the idea that God sent his son, their
[time=1649] Messiah, to be sacrificed for them.
[time=1651] It's a new thing.
[time=1652] Now it's 2,000 years old, and we're kind of passé.
[time=1659] But not really.
[time=1663] Not really.
[time=1664] It's as new today as it was then.
[time=1667] It's as real today for a new person as it was then.
[time=1671] And you'll notice it says that he inaugurated it for us, and that suggests that he created a trail for us.
[time=1679] Two weeks ago this very day, Amy and I, we had been on vacation with the sharks in North
[time=1685] Carolina.
[time=1688] I got in up to my toes because I'm very brave.
[time=1694] On our way back, we stopped and did a hike in Virginia.
[time=1699] We were on the Appalachian Trail, and the Appalachian Trail is 2,160 miles long.
[time=1707] We hiked one of them.
[time=1710] We weren't, you know, take a look at me.
[time=1713] We're not going for, I just read an article last night that there's a guy, an ultra marathoner who did the entire trail in 47 days.
[time=1721] That's like creepy.
[time=1723] I think he averaged 46 miles a day or some weird thing.
[time=1728] Yeah, I would have needed a helicopter to do that.
[time=1732] But as we got on this trail, we're not super experienced hikers.
[time=1735] We're out there because, you know, we like to be in nature and we need to move our bodies a little bit somehow, some way before they petrify.
[time=1742] And so we got out there and we're hiking this trail, and there's a, there's these little white splotches of paint on trees, on rocks, in different places.
[time=1752] And in hiking world, that's called a blaze.
[time=1756] And a blaze means that someone went there before you and marked the trail so you would know where to go.
[time=1762] We're doing our hike.
[time=1763] We got our poles and we're hiking.
[time=1765] We get to this place.
[time=1766] And the blaze goes straight up.
[time=1769] And I looked at her and she looked at me and I go, looks like the end of the trail to me.
[time=1774] I don't know what I'm supposed to do with that.
[time=1778] And there was this little narrow ledge about this wide and we, because we're not quitters.
[time=1785] We may be old and fat, but we're not quitters.
[time=1787] We're going to, we're climbing this dog-gone thing.
[time=1790] So we go up the side of this cliff.
[time=1793] We have no idea what we're doing.
[time=1795] And, and, you know, how do you think the children are going to spend their inheritance after we die?
[time=1800] You know what, that kind of having that conversation as you go up?
[time=1808] What the Bible saying here is that Jesus went ahead of you.
[time=1811] Someone went ahead of us and painted the trail on the rocks and the trees so that we would
[time=1818] know where we were going.
[time=1820] They blazed it for us.
[time=1823] And our Jesus blazed the trail to the heavenly Father, but not only did he do that.
[time=1830] He's there waiting for us at the top of the mountain.
[time=1836] He's at the right hand of the Father.
[time=1838] So not only did he make a trail, he walked the trail and he waits for us as an encouragement
[time=1845] at the end of the trail.
[time=1847] That's what he's done for us.
[time=1854] Dear friends, this is the hope of our lives.
[time=1861] Right?
[time=1862] I'm going to walk away from my Bible a bit.
[time=1865] Here, the car is about to go in the ditch.
[time=1867] This is like all the people at Wallom would go, "There he goes.
[time=1869] He's gone." I walk away from the Bible because this isn't Bible.
[time=1873] This is just such a musings.
[time=1878] We've spent a lot of time in America believing Washington, D.C. was going to solve our problems.
[time=1884] I think we're finding out, can I use a little New Havenism on you?
[time=1891] It ain't going to happen.
[time=1897] And as much as I love our country and we have a representative republic and we get to participate
[time=1904] in that whole thing, we maybe have lost a little bit of trust in this great Savior by thinking
[time=1912] the politicians were going to solve the problems.
[time=1915] We may have thought that if we could just be accepted by men, we would have our problem.
[time=1921] No.
[time=1922] Our hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=1931] I dare not trust anything but Him.
[time=1944] Okay, you guys are freaking me out with that clapping thing, okay?
[time=1951] I got a story to tell you about clapping.
[time=1956] Should I tell the story?
[time=1957] No, I shouldn't tell the story.
[time=1959] My wife says no, Diana says yes.
[time=1962] Who do I listen to?
[time=1963] Diana Cox, or the girl that I'm going home with?
[time=1966] I don't know.
[time=1971] I would be careful with me anyhow.
[time=1974] Don't trust me with your applause.
[time=1976] I know you weren't applauding me but the truth of what I said.
[time=1979] But it's a scary thing for a man to receive applause.
[time=1983] Because I could start to think that I'm somebody, okay?
[time=1988] So be very careful with that applause.
[time=1990] So we're in a meeting, Alistair Begg speaking, and he's preaching.
[time=1993] The people are going bananas.
[time=1995] And Alistair looks out at him and he says, you got to understand that I'm from Scotland.
[time=2000] I'm not quite used to that type of response to my preachy.
[time=2004] And he said a very profound thing next.
[time=2006] He says, and then he leaned out and he says, now put your hands in your pockets.
[time=2012] And let your applause be the obedience of your life.
[time=2019] And the room died.
[time=2022] And we know Alistair a little bit, we went to lunch with him later.
[time=2025] Alistair, what are you doing?
[time=2026] You killed the room.
[time=2028] He goes, John, I just don't want people to be frivolous about God's Word.
[time=2032] It's easy to applaud.
[time=2034] It really is.
[time=2036] It's much more difficult when those doors open up in an hour and a half when I'm done.
[time=2041] And you guys walk out the back of here.
[time=2045] And there's a world waiting out there that can't stand you.
[time=2049] And it's getting more hostile all the time.
[time=2052] And it's not going to do for us to just sit around and applaud for each other.
[time=2057] We're going to have to live for each other.
[time=2059] Oh, I've got more to say.
[time=2061] Are you ready?
[time=2062] So this is our hope.
[time=2066] But the writer of Hebrews sprinkles in another aspect of this.
[time=2071] And I know I'm going slow because I'm going to get the stuff for us to do in just a second.
[time=2077] There are at least four warning passages in the book of Hebrews.
[time=2082] If this Jesus is as great as I'm saying he is.
[time=2087] Okay, let's say for a moment, Mr. Critic, Mr. Skeptic, that sutures right.
[time=2091] And the Bible is true.
[time=2093] And Jesus is as great.
[time=2095] No, he's not one of the good ones.
[time=2097] He's the great one and the only one.
[time=2100] John said he's the only begotten of the Father.
[time=2103] The Greek is mano ganes.
[time=2104] One of a kind.
[time=2106] He's one of a kind.
[time=2107] There's none like him.
[time=2109] If that's true, what if you ignore him?
[time=2113] Chapter two, verse two and three.
[time=2117] And if you guys know your Bibles and you know the book of Hebrews, you know what I'm talking about.
[time=2122] I'm just going to show you two of the warning passages so you can get a flavor.
[time=2126] There are at least four and another guy said there are six.
[time=2129] I've always approached it as if there were four.
[time=2132] But chapter two, verse two.
[time=2134] So if the word spoken through the angels proved unalterable.
[time=2138] And every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense.
[time=2142] How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?
[time=2148] After I was at first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard and
[time=2156] God bore his witness with signs and wonders and miracles and gifts of the Spirit according
[time=2163] to his will.
[time=2164] If Jesus is this great and you ignore this salvation, what hope do you have?
[time=2173] Do you see where the Bible has taken us?
[time=2176] It is building an apologetic that if you don't believe in Jesus, you're in deep trouble.
[time=2180] Let me show you one more right back to our chapter 10.
[time=2183] And I'll skip the one that you may know the most in chapter six because it's controversial
[time=2190] and I don't have time for controversy this morning.
[time=2195] Verse 26 of Hebrews 10.
[time=2197] If we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins.
[time=2207] I thought I'd stop and let that hang over our heads a little bit.
[time=2214] If what I just said is true and Jesus is as great as I said he is, you have now received the knowledge of the truth this morning.
[time=2222] And if you spit in the face of Christ today like those Roman soldiers did and say you're a worthless bum, you're no better than a Buddhist statue with a string attached to his hand.
[time=2234] If that's the best you've got, here's what the Bible says, there's no more, there's not
[time=2240] another sacrifice.
[time=2241] Where else are you going to go?
[time=2245] And here's what you do have verse 27, a certain terrifying expectation of judgment in the fury of fire which will consume the adversaries, anyone who set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
[time=2257] How much severe punishment do you think he will deserve who's trampled under foot the Son of God and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant which was sanctified
[time=2269] and has resulted in the spirit of grace.
[time=2272] We know him who said vengeance is mine, I will repay.
[time=2275] And again the Lord will judge, it's a terrifying thing to fall in the hands of the living God.
[time=2280] And if you know Jesus as your Savior, you don't fall in the hands of the living God.
[time=2284] You draw near the living God because he blazed a trail to him for you and you fall in the
[time=2290] hands of the one who sits at the right hand of God.
[time=2295] But if you don't know Jesus, you fall, you bypass the one at the right hand and fall in
[time=2301] the hands of the Father and that's a scary place to be because you don't have the badge.
[time=2309] You wandered into a holy place without an identification card.
[time=2314] You're going to jail, baby.
[time=2319] That's basically the story of the book of Hebrews.
[time=2322] Jesus is greater than the entire Old Testament all combined together.
[time=2327] And if you do not follow him, you're in deep trouble.
[time=2334] I don't like that.
[time=2337] Couldn't you have made 50 different ways?
[time=2340] Could have.
[time=2342] In the wisdom of God, truth is much more easily discerned when it's narrow by nature.
[time=2350] You go into surgery tomorrow and your surgeon says, "You know, there's 50 different ways I could enter your body to take your spleen out."
[time=2361] I'm going to go, "Could you please take the most direct route that doesn't release the amount of damage, please?"
[time=2371] Let's not be talking in vagaries here.
[time=2376] It is the cancer of the soul that Jesus came to heal and it is specific and it is dynamic.
[time=2388] And there's not another religion on the earth that's even close.
[time=2394] It's not close.
[time=2397] We're driving last year, we were in southern India, we're driving through this little town called Travandran, a little town of three million and we're wandering through the town.
[time=2405] When we come to the street corner, there's a Hindu temple at the street corner and all of a sudden there's an explosion at the Hebrew temple, not a lot of Hebrews in India.
[time=2416] The Hindu temple, there's an explosion and we're like, "What's up with that?"
[time=2422] Someone had dropped some money in the offering and that's the temple to the sleeping Hindu
[time=2428] God.
[time=2429] And when you drop your money in the offering, the explosion wakes him up so you can pray to him.
[time=2436] I'm not making that up.
[time=2443] So I can give money to the sleeping thing and wake him up.
[time=2447] You'll hear a prayer, "How long does he stay awake?" Seems to have a lot of problems here or I can bow in the name of my Savior and go to the
[time=2461] right hand of the Father and I have access through him.
[time=2468] He blazed the trail right there.
[time=2472] That's the great.
[time=2473] It's really great.
[time=2475] We should just stop there except for one thing.
[time=2481] We need to be made good and we need to be shown what it's like to follow the great one.
[time=2489] Now here's what the writer of Hebrews does.
[time=2491] He's been building the entire letter, "Jesus great, Jesus great, Jesus great, Jesus great." Now let me tell you your response to that.
[time=2498] So verse 19 started out, "Since this is true," verse 21, "Since this is true and he gives
[time=2506] three commands that we join in and the good then are the Christ followers and we now reflect
[time=2517] the glory of God and how we live." So in verse 22, here's the first one, "Since Jesus is great," and by the way it's written
[time=2527] in such a way where the author joins his recipients in living out the command, "Let
[time=2535] us do this." This isn't just, "You go do this," I'm going to go, "No, let us do this together."
[time=2543] I put him in first person for the sake of impact.
[time=2549] So here's the idea, "Since Jesus is great, I will draw near to God."
[time=2555] Since Jesus is great, I'm going to do that.
[time=2558] Since all this is true, let us draw near with a sincere heart and full assurance of faith, having a heart sprinkle clean from an evil conscience, our bodies wash with pure water.
[time=2566] Since Jesus is great, my response is this, "Faith."
[time=2581] This church, I'm going to go off again, this wasn't in the notes, it means so much to Amy
[time=2587] and I because this church stood here, see how many years ago was it, thirty, seven years
[time=2595] ago for me and showed me the gospel.
[time=2601] And I was a beer drink and pot smoking foul-mouthed idiot.
[time=2608] Now I'm just an idiot.
[time=2611] Yeah, okay, I haven't smoked, no, I'm just kidding.
[time=2619] And faith met the message of the greatness of Christ and here's what happened.
[time=2625] It changed the trajectory of my entire life and you people came here to listen to me talk.
[time=2632] What is wrong with you?
[time=2635] I always tell the people at wall and if you're a guest, thanks for coming.
[time=2638] If you came back, it's on you, you know, fool you once, fool you twice, think.
[time=2647] It wasn't because I was special and it wasn't because I was great.
[time=2651] But you look what happened, you believe we draw near with faith and it changes the trajectory
[time=2658] of our life and I am now filled with assurance that I am my father's son.
[time=2663] I am filled with clarity that he is my father and I am his servant.
[time=2669] There's not any discussion, there's not any disconnect in that.
[time=2674] I know he's great, I know I'm not.
[time=2676] I know in his greatness he took an evil young man and out of the love of you dear people
[time=2682] as well and Amy got saved here.
[time=2684] You were about 12 or 13 years old in Sunday school class.
[time=2688] There was an old cranky guy named Gene McCoy, you guys remember Gene?
[time=2693] He wasn't cranky at all, I was being, he was the sweetest giant on the planet 611 and we
[time=2699] won't say how much you wait, he was a big dude, let's just put it that.
[time=2702] And he taught Amy how to love God and Rick Hawk showed me how to love Christ and it's
[time=2711] because of you, because you love Jesus enough to have a witness for Christ in this place
[time=2717] is because of manual Baptist Church on Hessen Castle of Wayne Trace and I don't remember what street it's on, it's over there by McMillan Park, that funny looking building over there and they started all these, they started walling too.
[time=2731] And we stand together for the cause of Christ in this community and we beg people to believe
[time=2738] and when you believe the trajectory of your life changes.
[time=2741] Now how does that, that's the what, the how is with purity of life, you'll notice in the passage, our hearts are sprinkled clean.
[time=2750] What an amazing statement the Bible makes that faith in Jesus Christ can actually wash your heart, just flip back a page to chapter 9 verses 13 and 14 it says this, "If the blood
[time=2762] of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who've been defiled can sanctify the cleansing of the flesh.
[time=2770] How much more will the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without blemish to God cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
[time=2782] And we have our consciences made new and it is a glorious thing.
[time=2787] It's confusing when you first start.
[time=2790] I didn't know what to do.
[time=2794] The only Bible we owned was the one the funeral home gave us when my father died when I was 14 years old.
[time=2801] I dug that out of the closet because I noticed people dragging those big books with them to church.
[time=2806] Well I didn't do that.
[time=2809] I brought it in and I didn't know genuine cow hide from book of Revelation.
[time=2815] I didn't know where anything was in that book.
[time=2821] It's confusing but the trajectory was real and the heart was different.
[time=2825] My conscience was different and no one told me to stop smoking pot.
[time=2829] I figured it out all by myself.
[time=2832] This didn't make sense anymore.
[time=2835] It didn't make sense to be a drunk anymore.
[time=2845] My life was different.
[time=2846] Your life can be different.
[time=2848] Second one.
[time=2849] Since Jesus is great I will draw near to God.
[time=2852] I will persevere with God verse 23.
[time=2855] Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering for he who promised his faithful.
[time=2862] We are going to hang on dear friends in the belief of the greatness of Christ in the midst of uncertainty we've been singing about it this morning.
[time=2870] Now we must go live it out there in the neighborhood.
[time=2874] And our country is coming for us.
[time=2879] And we are going to be the persecuted ones.
[time=2880] I didn't think I was going to get here in my lifetime.
[time=2883] It's happened so rapidly that it's kind of caught me off guard because I've been trying to teach the young people at our church they're coming for you and you're not going to get away.
[time=2892] They're going to put me in a box and dirt over it and tell me they're going to edit all the junk out and tell how wonderful a person I was on that day.
[time=2898] And everyone will go man he was really wasn't that good.
[time=2900] I don't know why they said all those nice stories.
[time=2902] And then I'm going to go and be with my Lord and you guys get the fight down here.
[time=2908] We've been trying to prepare our young people to do war at our church.
[time=2912] You've got to be ready for war.
[time=2916] You've got to be ready to stand up for your faith.
[time=2918] You go down to Indiana University, you better be ready to stand up for faith.
[time=2923] Your young people going over to Columbus, Ohio and our church there are a lot of people from Michigan.
[time=2928] I think that's a foreign country.
[time=2931] They're doing foreign missions over there in Columbus, according to the Michigan people.
[time=2941] And they will learn.
[time=2943] You pray for them.
[time=2945] You pray that they learn that their faith is strong in the midst of an evil world.
[time=2957] Our young people need us.
[time=2959] Don't forget about them when they go to college.
[time=2962] Drive down and visit your kids.
[time=2963] Take a day off.
[time=2964] Buy them lunch.
[time=2965] They'll let you feed them.
[time=2966] They always do that.
[time=2971] Check out, make sure they're walking with God.
[time=2973] If your kids go to Christian University, you better go there, too.
[time=2982] So our hope, our belief in the greatness of Christ, is there at all times.
[time=2989] When you go to 1 Peter chapter 3, oh, I'm really late.
[time=2997] Oh, I knew I would be.
[time=3004] At Wallen, the people at our church know that the Methodists are going to beat them to crack or barrel on Sunday.
[time=3013] It's in the membership clause when you join the church.
[time=3015] It's right there.
[time=3016] You will be the last in line at Mo's, you know, it's not going to work out well.
[time=3022] The Bible is so interesting, though, isn't it, I mean, verse 13.
[time=3028] And who is there to harm you if your zealous for good?
[time=3031] But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you're blessed.
[time=3034] Do not fear their intimidation and do not be troubled, but sanctify Christ, the Lord in your hearts and always be ready to make a defense to everyone who asked you to give it a count for what?
[time=3045] Your hope.
[time=3047] How can you be so hopeful in the midst of this mistreatment?
[time=3052] Because of Jesus, all you can do is kill me.
[time=3058] That's all you can do to me.
[time=3061] If you kill me, I win.
[time=3065] Get it up.
[time=3066] Go for it.
[time=3072] Keep a good conscience verse 16, so the thing in which you're slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame, put on display the greatness of Christ by the life that you live.
[time=3082] Would you like a little poetry?
[time=3087] Let me give you a little poetry.
[time=3091] You ready?
[time=3092] All right.
[time=3093] I've got to find it.
[time=3095] Old guy's eyes up here.
[time=3097] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=3104] I dare not trust the sweetest frame but holy lean on Jesus' name.
[time=3111] On Christ, the solid rock I stand, all other ground, sinking sand.
[time=3119] When darkness veils his lovely face, I rest on his unchanging grace.
[time=3124] In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds Hebrew 6, 19 says your hope is the anchor
[time=3130] of your life.
[time=3134] In the veil, his oath, his covenant and his blood support me in the whelming flood when
[time=3140] all around my soul gives way, he then is all my hope and stay.
[time=3146] When he shall come with trumpet sound, oh may I then in him be found, dressed in his righteousness alone, faultless to stand before the throne.
[time=3154] On Christ, the solid rock I stand, all other ground, sinking sand.
[time=3163] That's our hope.
[time=3164] It is our anchor and we never let go.
[time=3168] How do you hold on to it?
[time=3170] With tenacity.
[time=3172] The text says without wavering, there's nothing that gets in the way of you hanging on to your hope and persecutions coming for us and it's going to sift the church and we will
[time=3184] find out who's really holding on to the anchor.
[time=3186] This may be the best moment in the body of Christ in many years in the United States.
[time=3193] It will certainly be the most difficult.
[time=3197] Let her see, says Jesus is great, I will work for God.
[time=3203] Gotta get back.
[time=3207] Let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds.
[time=3210] What is this?
[time=3211] This is love.
[time=3212] This is how we stimulate one another.
[time=3214] The word really means to irritate.
[time=3216] Isn't that interesting?
[time=3219] We're supposed to irritate one another to do good.
[time=3226] How do you do that?
[time=3229] By being a part of a living, breathing community.
[time=3234] I am so glad you're in church today.
[time=3236] You're not going to hear messages like this on Fox News, even are you?
[time=3241] They're not going to tell you about Jesus and how great he is.
[time=3243] They're not going to defend his greatness compared to other religions.
[time=3246] He wouldn't be expedient or politically correct to do so, so you've got to go to church.
[time=3251] We need each other.
[time=3252] One of the reasons I like the lights up, I want you to see each other.
[time=3256] You're in this together, Black Hawk.
[time=3262] Could it be your greatest days are right in front of you?
[time=3266] Could it be that this church has just been prepared for the great things that are right ahead of them?
[time=3273] Come on, let's do this.
[time=3280] First thing you have to do, Jesse, go to the hog roast.
[time=3286] It's old-fashioned potluck.
[time=3289] Yeah, I'm out there, I'm hearing you.
[time=3294] It's always tough at the church potluck because you're like, "Who gets to be first in line?
[time=3300] When I position myself at the right table, I like the desserts over there in that corner."
[time=3307] I don't talk about that.
[time=3311] Why do we do all this conclusion?
[time=3314] Look at the last phrase in the text, "Because the day's drawing near."
[time=3320] The day's drawing near.
[time=3323] We are convinced that Jesus Christ is going to return.
[time=3326] You know what else?
[time=3328] The writer of Hebrews was convinced He was coming in.
[time=3331] I don't know if you noticed, but in the first three verses of Hebrews, I can guarantee you this.
[time=3335] We're already in the last days.
[time=3337] Jesus ushered in the last days.
[time=3343] And a lot of people in America are saying this, "He's got to come back.
[time=3347] Look how bad it is." Let me tell you a little different take on that.
[time=3351] In Asia right now, here's what the numbers are.
[time=3354] You want to hear these numbers?
[time=3356] These five thousand people a day are coming to Christ in Asia right now.
[time=3364] If He...
[time=3366] Here's what He's asking us to do in America as His followers.
[time=3369] I'm convinced of this and I'd be willing to be wrong because I don't want to be right about this.
[time=3374] He's asking us to now suffer for His namesake so that those brothers in Asia can come to know Jesus.
[time=3380] See, don't wrap God in the flag and make Him ethnocentric on the United States.
[time=3386] He is a worldwide God, every tribe tongue nation.
[time=3389] He's not a respecter of the United States.
[time=3391] He's a respecter of His own will and His own power.
[time=3394] And right now, He's doing phenomenal things in Asia, 15,000 a day in China alone coming
[time=3400] to know Christ as Savior.
[time=3402] He's asking you and I to put up with a little bit of suffering on this planet so those dear people can find Him.
[time=3408] If somebody put up with some suffering soul in 1978, I can find Him.
[time=3413] And it's my job now to suffer for His name's sake.
[time=3419] He has not forgotten us in our pain.
[time=3422] He has not deserted you.
[time=3425] Okay?
[time=3426] And I know we look around and go, "Oh my goodness, the homosexuals, they're taking over the world.
[time=3432] We're in trouble." No.
[time=3436] Our hope was never in being an American.
[time=3440] We're citizens of heaven and our hope is in Christ.
[time=3446] So if America comes unglued, which it ethnically, morally appears to be doing, it is for us
[time=3458] to be the ethical, moral people in the midst of the struggle.
[time=3464] Are you ready for another poem?
[time=3466] All right.
[time=3468] Here's what we're going to do.
[time=3469] Did we do it?
[time=3470] We're going to do Hallelujah to Savior.
[time=3473] Hallelujah.
[time=3474] Okay.
[time=3475] Here's how we're going to do this.
[time=3476] You're going to stand.
[time=3477] I'm going to read the verse.
[time=3480] You're going to respond with the final line of it.
[time=3484] Are you ready?
[time=3485] We're going to do all five verses.
[time=3487] You verbally, I assume you're going to blow the roof off of this dump, right?
[time=3495] I didn't mean dump, sorry.
[time=3499] Man of sorrows, what a name, for the Son of God who came, ruined sinners to reclaim.
[time=3510] Bering shame and scoffing rude, in my place condemned, he stood, sealed my pardon with
[time=3518] his blood.
[time=3521] Hallelujah.
[time=3523] Guilty vile and helplessly spotless Lamb of God was he full atonement.
[time=3530] Can it be?
[time=3531] Hallelujah.
[time=3533] Lifted up was he to die.
[time=3535] It is finished was his cry.
[time=3538] Now in heaven exalted high.
[time=3541] Hallelujah, the Savior.
[time=3544] You're running out of gas.
[time=3545] I want you to go big on this last one.
[time=3547] When he comes our glorious King, all his ransomed home to bring, then anew, this song
[time=3554] will sing.
[time=3555] Hallelujah.
[time=3556] Let us sing.
[time=3557] [AMEN - 1 seconds]
[time=3568] You
