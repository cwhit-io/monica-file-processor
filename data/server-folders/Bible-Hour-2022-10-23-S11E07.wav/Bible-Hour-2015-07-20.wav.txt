[time=415] You'll come, you'll come, you'll come.
[time=444] Thanks, guys.
[time=445] Good morning, everybody.
[time=446] Maybe seated.
[time=449] In church, I've been a part of church my whole life.
[time=453] My parents have been with us for the last week and a half or so.
[time=456] And from the time I can remember anything in my life, there are church memories attached to it, for which I am very grateful.
[time=464] And so I've been taking communion my whole life.
[time=469] And many of you would have the same story.
[time=471] If you have that same story, can you nod your head in some way that you've been doing this your whole life?
[time=476] Sometimes when you get involved in doing something for that long, you forget what you're doing and why you're doing it.
[time=483] Maybe you're here like Darren said for the first time and we are really glad that you're here today.
[time=487] I want to just talk for a minute about what we're going to do and why we're going to do it.
[time=492] Because I like to know what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.
[time=495] Maybe you do too.
[time=496] Maybe just be reminded.
[time=497] It's a good thing.
[time=499] Many years ago, people of Israel were enslaved in Egypt.
[time=504] They had been for centuries until a time came when God said, "You need to go free.
[time=510] I will set you free." And he does.
[time=512] By miraculous signs and wonders, people of Israel are set free from their slavery in Egypt and they left in a hurry.
[time=520] In fact, so fast that the bread they were making for the trip didn't have a chance to rise.
[time=526] And so they partook of this feast, which God ordained called the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
[time=531] And part of God's leading them out of Egypt was that he sent an angel, an angel of death
[time=540] that was the last straw for the people of Egypt to let the people of Israel go.
[time=543] An angel of death passed over the houses in Israel where they were living, where the
[time=549] blood was in the doorposts.
[time=551] So it's come to be known as Passover for that reason.
[time=555] Lord Jesus, the last night he was on the earth of the disciples, took the Passover meal with them.
[time=562] And he said, "Guys, this whole event that you've been doing your whole lives to is going
[time=569] to be re-imagined that my body is the bread.
[time=575] And the wine that you're drinking, that's my blood." In 1 Corinthians chapter 5, it's the author of Corinthians, Paul says, "The Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed." That's why we're taking this this morning.
[time=590] And so the next verse says, in 1 Corinthians 5, so we celebrate.
[time=595] We celebrate.
[time=596] We give thanks for what God has done.
[time=598] In 1 Corinthians 11, which we'll read in just a minute, if there's a call to examine yourselves, to be mindful.
[time=606] So we take the bread and we take the cup this morning to remember.
[time=610] But those are exactly the words that Jesus used when he was talking with his disciples.
[time=616] As often as you do this, remember what I've told you.
[time=619] That's why we're doing this, to remember him and what he has done for us.
[time=625] There are tables all over the sanctuary where you can get up and come get the bread and the cup, if you wouldn't return to your seat, we'll sing a couple of songs.
[time=633] And when that's over, I'll come back up and we'll partake of those things together.
[time=637] I just want to encourage you, at that this morning, to celebrate what Christ has done, to be mindful of your own needfulness of that day by day.
[time=646] So I encourage you to come and to partake.
[time=648] There'll be those to serve you at the tables and to come get the bread and the cup and I'll come back in just a few minutes and we'll partake together.
[time=655] Take my life and let it be, concert greater, Lord, to thee.
[time=673] Take my moments and my days, let them flow in seas last grace, let them flow in seas
[time=693] Take my hands and let them move at the impulse of my love, take my feet and let them flee,
[time=716] swift and beautiful for thee, swift and beautiful for thee.
[time=729] I am yours set apart for you, I am yours, hungry for your truth, take my life, you are
[time=745] yours, I am yours, take my voice and let me sing, always only for thy King, take my
[time=770] life and let them be, filled with messages from me, filled with messages from me, I am
[time=789] yours set apart for you, I am yours, hungry for your truth.
[time=799] Take my life, you are all I live for, I am yours set apart for you, I am yours, hungry
[time=815] for your truth, take my life, you are all I live for, I am yours.
[time=829] Take my will and make it right, it shall be no longer mine, take my heart, it is my
[time=856] love, it shall be thy royal throne, it shall be thy royal throne, I am yours set apart
[time=874] for you, I am yours, hungry for your truth, take my life, you are all I live for, I am
[time=886] yours set apart for you, I am yours, hungry for your truth, take my life, you are all I
[time=909] live for, I am yours, take my life, you are all I live for, I am yours, I am yours, I
[time=932] am yours, I am yours, I am yours.
[time=953] I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours,
[time=1064] For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you that the Lord Jesus on the night when
[time=1088] he was betrayed took bread and when he had given things he broke it and said this is
[time=1095] my body which is for you do this in remembrance of me.
[time=1109] In the same way also he took the cup after supper saying this cup is the new covenant
[time=1115] in my blood do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[time=1126] As often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the Lord's death until
[time=1134] he comes.
[time=1150] Your presence is heaven to me, oh Jesus, oh Jesus, your presence is heaven to me.
[time=1172] So all my days on earth I will await, the moment that I see faces face to face, nothing in
[time=1187] this world will set inside, Jesus, your love that won't run dry, oh Jesus, you're the
[time=1201] love that won't run dry, oh the presence is heaven to me, oh Jesus, your presence is
[time=1225] heaven to me, oh Jesus your presence is heaven to me, oh Jesus your presence is heaven to
[time=1253] me, oh Jesus, oh Jesus, oh Jesus, your presence is heaven to me, oh Jesus, oh Jesus, your
[time=1281] presence is heaven to me.
[time=1291] The Lord have brought me through all of my sorrows, when I failed him, he didn't cast
[time=1317] me awake, he stood right by me, through all of my troubles, when I was gone, he didn't
[time=1330] let me go to pray, he took my sin and saved my soul, he cleaned me up and made me go.
[time=1349] Jesus died on Calvary, so the whole wide world could be, it was a great thing, that
[time=1360] he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he
[time=1388] did for me, he's been my doctor, he's been my lawyer, my God's been good to me, he's been
[time=1404] my friend, he's been my perfect friend, when I was lonely, when I was low and astrayed,
[time=1418] he took me in, oh he took my sin and saved my soul, he cleaned me up and made me go.
[time=1436] Jesus died on Calvary, so the whole wide world could be, it was a great thing, that
[time=1447] he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he
[time=1495] it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing,
[time=1511] that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing, that
[time=1533] for me, it was a great thing, it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing,
[time=1540] that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did
[time=1555] great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did for me, it was a great thing, that he did This is a picture of my nephew, Jack. He is my nephew. It's really a picture of him. We are related.
[time=1590] Jack is six now. Jack was diagnosed with type one diabetes when he was two. And it's been a long road for him, a long road for his family.
[time=1607] Type one diabetes is not brought on by anything. It's genetic. It was something that came about. Jack was in the hospital, very close to death when he was diagnosed, in fact.
[time=1621] Type one diabetes is when your pancreas doesn't work right. He has a pancreas. This doesn't function the way it should, and so his levels.
[time=1630] The pancreas manages, Jody can correct me here if I'm wrong, but it manages the levels of the way your body should function.
[time=1640] And Jack doesn't work that way, so it has to be managed for him by machines and by his parents and by injections.
[time=1646] And it's hard to get up in the night several times. And it's hard to think about, he was also born with one kidney.
[time=1656] So it's also hard to think about what he will and will not be able to experience in his life.
[time=1662] Jack has organs that don't function the way that they should.
[time=1668] This is a quote from a guy named Christopher Richardson that I thought was appropriate in light of what I just said.
[time=1680] It's actually from FF Bruce, not Christopher Richardson. Physical eyesight produces conviction or evidence of visible things.
[time=1690] Physical eyesight produces conviction or evidence of visible things. There's Jim, right there I can see him.
[time=1698] I'm convinced that you are sitting there, Jim, whether you are or not. I have conviction that you are.
[time=1705] Certainty, no, that have evidence of visible things. Faith is the organ which enables people to see the invisible order.
[time=1718] Faith is good for you to jot down. Faith is the organ which enables people to see the invisible order.
[time=1732] Physical eyesight gives me convictions about what I see. Faith is the organ which enables people to see the invisible order.
[time=1742] If you have your Bibles this morning, we're going to be in Hebrews 11. Hebrews 11 comes after Hebrews 10 and before Hebrews 12.
[time=1753] It's your welcome. It's set very perfectly in order in that way and I want to talk to you a little bit about that.
[time=1759] We will indeed not be in Hebrews 10 again this week. We will refer back to it.
[time=1765] My friends Josh and John in recent days have brought us this information. I was just overwhelmed at Josh's message a couple weeks ago.
[time=1775] I've never heard him bring the word of God in a finer fashion.
[time=1780] I thought Hebrews 11 was a good follow up to Hebrews 10. Can I pray as we start this morning?
[time=1788] Heavenly Father, thank you for your son Jesus who loved us and gave himself for us.
[time=1796] I pray that at the end of our morning today we would treasure him more than we ever have ever in our lives.
[time=1804] I pray that in his name with great thanksgiving. Amen.
[time=1810] Can I ask you to stand as we read these verses and we'll be in Hebrews 11.
[time=1818] I want to read the first six verses of Hebrews 11. I don't know that they will all be on the screen behind me but if not you can take a look on your own devices or with your Bible in front of you.
[time=1830] Hebrews 11. The first three verses are in your bulletin if you want to take a look at that.
[time=1836] Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for. The conviction of things not seen for by it the people of old received their commendation.
[time=1851] By faith we understand that the universe was created by the Word of God so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.
[time=1864] By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain through which he was commended as righteous. God commending him by accepting his gifts.
[time=1879] And through his faith though he died he still speaks. Hebrews 11 verse 5. By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death.
[time=1891] And he was not found because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God. Without faith it is impossible to please God.
[time=1905] For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. He may be seated.
[time=1914] Excuse me.
[time=1917] There are three points in your bulletin this morning. The first point is the word conviction.
[time=1924] Preachers like to use the same letter for all three points and I will do so this morning. You're welcome. Conviction is number one.
[time=1933] Conviction Hebrews 11 verse one. Faith is the assurance of things hoped for. The conviction of things not seen. Great confidence.
[time=1945] Firm trust is this word. F.F. Bruce I mentioned earlier he calls this a firm foundation.
[time=1955] This is not the way we usually think about faith. We hear it in songs. We hear it in popular songs. You just got to have faith.
[time=1964] And sort of this it's not it's just faith. It's faith for faith's sake or faith in faith. A lot of I've been teaching in Christian schools for almost 20 years.
[time=1975] And I think a lot of Christian school students end up having faith in their faith.
[time=1982] I trust that my belief will save me. I trust that my confession by itself will save me.
[time=1991] As opposed to thinking my faith in Jesus has saved me. This is in your outline as well friends. This first point here.
[time=1999] Your faith, my faith, our faith is only as strong as the object in which it's placed.
[time=2009] Your faith is only as strong as the object in which it is placed.
[time=2017] By that I mean this. There's been a lot of spiritual damage done to people who say things like two other people we just got to have more faith.
[time=2027] Is your child sick? We got to have more faith. You lost your job? We got to have more faith. More faith.
[time=2036] Friends I'm happy to tell you this morning that's not true. And you can quote me on that. It might be true, but I don't know that for you.
[time=2046] What's important is the object in which I place my faith. And he has a name and his name is Jesus. Romans 824.
[time=2056] Would you look at that with me? Romans 824. It should be on the screen behind me.
[time=2068] Faith and hope, they're tied together in a very real way. For in this hope we were saved.
[time=2076] Now hope that is seen is not hoped, is not hoped for who hopes for what he sees.
[time=2083] It's being sure Hebrews 11 verse one of things that you can't see.
[time=2088] Remember, faith is the organ which makes the invisible visible.
[time=2094] It's the organ that is exercised or used where I can see things that God has said in ways I could not see them otherwise.
[time=2102] Faith is not this disembodied fantasy. I really hope, I really hope faith and hope are tied together.
[time=2109] I really hope it rains today or not. Because it might or it might not.
[time=2115] It's not just hope for hope's sake. I hope that joy makes good time getting home to Virginia.
[time=2123] My sister Joy makes good time getting home to Virginia. She might, she might not.
[time=2126] I don't know. Who hopes for what they see. I don't know what's going to happen.
[time=2131] Faith is a real expectation. It's a confident assurance in what God has uniquely done in and through Jesus.
[time=2139] Faith. I'll say that again.
[time=2142] Faith is a real expectation, a confident assurance in what God has done and is doing through Jesus.
[time=2151] Faith. It's not simply, "Gee, I hope so in that sense or maybe it will happen or maybe it will not. That's not the way the Bible talks about faith.
[time=2160] Faith in leaders, faith in places, faith in organizations or structures is inherently faulty, which is why your faith is only as strong as the object in which you have placed it.
[time=2174] My wife had been married for 16 years, just 10 days ago or so, or anniversary, 16 years.
[time=2183] And there have been many people in my life in our lives along the way, leaders, spiritual leaders who invested in us and those around us that are no longer in ministry.
[time=2196] There are some that are, praise God. Some that are not because they shipwrecked their faith and their whole ministry.
[time=2203] And if my faith was placed in them, I would not be standing before you this morning. I hope you understand that.
[time=2211] But my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=2218] And so, if you are in that camp this morning, on Christ, the solid rock I stand, all other ground is what?
[time=2228] Stinking sand. Believe it, friends. Believe it. It's true.
[time=2233] Faith is a real expectation and a confident assurance in what God has uniquely done in and through Jesus.
[time=2241] Uniquely done through him. No other name. No other name. Our faith is only as strong as the object in which we place it.
[time=2251] Not the amount of our faith, but the object. The object. Look at Hebrews 10, which again comes before Hebrews 11.
[time=2262] Listen. Let's look at starting in verse 19. I know this is a review, but it's worth it.
[time=2268] Therefore, brothers and sisters, Hebrews 10 verse 19. Therefore, brothers and sisters.
[time=2275] Since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain that is his flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
[time=2293] with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
[time=2300] He's already done it. I place my faith in him. He is the one by which I may have that confidence.
[time=2308] The only one. So it's not faith. Faith in your ability to manage things.
[time=2316] Faith in the ability of an organization or a structure to get you through.
[time=2322] You know that you will not make it if you do that. You know that.
[time=2325] Talk to an older person in the room today and they will tell you stories of how their faith in Christ has sustained them.
[time=2333] Their faith in others has not. We should listen, friends. We should be good listeners in the church of all other places.
[time=2342] Hebrews 11 between Hebrews 10 and Hebrews 12. Hebrews, of course, we don't read the Bible this way, tragically.
[time=2351] We should. It was a letter written to a group of people who needed encouragement.
[time=2357] And so if you read the letter all the way through from beginning to end, if I got a letter in hand, I used to get letters from my grandfather, my mom's dad, in college.
[time=2367] Handwritten letters from Ralph. Ralph Roy was his name. This is only grandson.
[time=2375] And I loved him. And I came to faith at 19. I was a sophomore.
[time=2383] And my grandfather invested in me.
[time=2387] And wrote me letters. I didn't read them like a paragraph at a time and put it down.
[time=2391] We're all the way through.
[time=2394] When you read Hebrews 10, 11 and 12 together, as you would a real letter, you get a sense of the flow.
[time=2402] And so Hebrews 10, your Bibles probably have headings before the chapters. Do you see that in Hebrews 10?
[time=2408] Mine says Christ sacrificed once for all for Hebrews 10.
[time=2412] Something like that probably here says it too.
[time=2415] Hebrews 11, of course, is a whole chapter about faith and those that have had faith that come before us.
[time=2422] Hebrews 12 comes after Hebrews 11. And the heading in my Bible says Jesus,
[time=2428] founder, pioneer, and perfecter of our faith.
[time=2434] If you read Hebrews 11 without being bracketed by Hebrews 10 and 12, then we're not reading it correctly.
[time=2441] What's the point? Abel and Enoch and others in chapter 11 are to be commended,
[time=2447] and they were commended by God for their faith. But the focus of all this is Jesus.
[time=2452] That's how Hebrews 1 starts. Hebrews 11, verse 2 says this.
[time=2462] For by it, there refers back to faith. For by it the people of old received their commendation.
[time=2472] Hebrews 11, verse 6 will go on to say that without faith it's impossible to please God.
[time=2478] So number 2 in your outline is commendation, commendation.
[time=2486] Good testimony. In fact, in your notes it reads this way.
[time=2490] Faith is the only way to receive good testimony from God.
[time=2497] In fact, all these commendations are what makes up the rest of Hebrews 11.
[time=2501] There's a whole list of commendations. Faith. By faith Abel. By faith Enoch.
[time=2508] By faith Noah. By faith Abraham. On and on and on it goes.
[time=2516] It's given chronologically. And guess who it culminates with in Hebrews 12.
[time=2521] You'll never guess. Jesus. Something better.
[time=2529] The one who is better. Better than everything. Better than the old system.
[time=2533] Better than the priesthood. That's the message of all of Hebrews.
[time=2536] It's he's better. Better than what? Better than everything. Better than everyone.
[time=2545] The new living translation says that verse 2 says they earned a good reputation.
[time=2549] That's not quite helpful enough.
[time=2551] The NASB which may have in front of you says gained approval.
[time=2555] I like that. They gained approval. By faith.
[time=2562] Some of you have been searching for approval your whole life.
[time=2570] I just want someone to say I'm doing a good job.
[time=2574] Someone to say they love me. Someone to say.
[time=2582] You're my friend. It's going to be okay.
[time=2588] By faith the men of old and women of old gained their approval.
[time=2595] Friends I will tell you. And the Bible affirms this.
[time=2600] If you have approval before men but not before God.
[time=2604] That's a bad trade.
[time=2608] By faith the men of old gained approval. Faith is the evidence.
[time=2612] Remember of things not seen.
[time=2616] And you've watched with me the tide in our culture.
[time=2619] The tide in our culture this summer has not gone in a direction.
[time=2622] My eyesight says things are off the rails.
[time=2627] Maybe yours too.
[time=2630] Okay. My eyesight. My circumstances.
[time=2634] Where's God?
[time=2638] This sermon's title it was just called Faith, Sight, and Our Circumstances.
[time=2644] Faith is the evidence of things that I cannot see.
[time=2648] Where's God at work in the world today?
[time=2650] We'll revive Indiana as a very helpful corrective to that.
[time=2653] He's at work in this place to be sure.
[time=2655] But it's easy to watch the news and just despair.
[time=2659] Just despair.
[time=2661] The Bible tells you if you have ears to hear it, that faith in Jesus is the way to receive God's approval.
[time=2669] The Bible tells you, listen to me please, wherever you are in the sound of my voice.
[time=2675] The Bible tells you if you have ears to hear it, that faith in Jesus is the way to gain God's approval.
[time=2682] God's approval.
[time=2686] Which might be at the expense of man's approval, but always better.
[time=2691] Always better.
[time=2693] It is confident assurance that Jesus has already done everything you need to approach the throne of grace.
[time=2702] The throne of grace.
[time=2704] Since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
[time=2711] Why?
[time=2712] We don't have a high priest who is able to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who is in every respect, who in every respect has been tempted like we are yet without sin.
[time=2721] Let us then, with confidence, draw near to the throne of grace
[time=2729] that we might receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
[time=2734] The throne of grace, that phrase has knocked me over.
[time=2742] Name another God who has a throne of grace.
[time=2748] Thrones, to be sure, other gods have a flabby kind of permissive kindness.
[time=2755] Do what you want.
[time=2757] Do as thou wilt.
[time=2759] That's not grace.
[time=2762] A throne of grace, you can approach it.
[time=2767] This is how chapter 10 ends.
[time=2769] This is chapter 10 starting with verse 31.
[time=2773] Please don't lose sight of this.
[time=2775] It's a fearful thing, Hebrews 1031, to fall into the hands of the living God.
[time=2780] But recall the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings.
[time=2788] Back to earlier about having an amount of faith.
[time=2792] And your kid is sick, have more faith.
[time=2794] You lost your job, have more faith.
[time=2796] You are in a bad circumstance, have more faith.
[time=2799] When did these people endure their sufferings before or after they were enlightened?
[time=2805] I can't hear you.
[time=2806] After, after you were enlightened, you had struggle.
[time=2812] If you're struggling, you must be in sin.
[time=2815] So, no, maybe.
[time=2819] But the Bible says that this struggle and suffering comes after enlightenment.
[time=2824] And look at Hebrews 11, it firms the same thing.
[time=2827] Sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach, verse 33, and affliction.
[time=2831] And sometimes being partners with those so treated.
[time=2834] For you had compassion on those in prison.
[time=2837] And you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property.
[time=2841] Since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one.
[time=2845] Therefore, do not throw away your confidence which has a great reward.
[time=2850] For you have need of endurance.
[time=2852] So that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what is promised for you.
[time=2856] A little while in the coming one will come and he will not delay.
[time=2859] My righteous one shall live by faith.
[time=2862] If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.
[time=2865] Listen to 39, but we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed.
[time=2869] But of those who have faith and preserve their souls.
[time=2873] Faith in the one who allows to approach a throne of grace.
[time=2876] That's why I cannot shrink back because of Jesus.
[time=2879] Not because I can do it.
[time=2882] I can fend off those.
[time=2883] I can do it.
[time=2884] He's done it for you.
[time=2887] That's why you can have faith in that shrink back.
[time=2889] It's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an angry God.
[time=2892] It's a fearful thing.
[time=2894] It's a terrible thing.
[time=2896] And Christ has entered through that veil for you.
[time=2901] Faith is the only way to receive a good testimony from God.
[time=2905] The only way.
[time=2906] A commendation.
[time=2908] He's with me.
[time=2914] Abel suffered.
[time=2917] Righteous Abel suffered at the hands of his brother.
[time=2922] And his suffering didn't disqualify him as a saint.
[time=2927] We can't be prisoners of our circumstance.
[time=2929] I mentioned that to you before from this pulpit.
[time=2931] I'll mention it again.
[time=2932] We must not be prisoners of our circumstances.
[time=2935] Hebrews 1139 says they were still commended through their faith.
[time=2941] There was no law for Abel to keep.
[time=2944] He said, God says, this is my sacrifice that I want Abel.
[time=2948] And he offered it, and God says he was commended by his faith.
[time=2953] There's no righteousness by works in the Old Testament.
[time=2956] As far back as you go, it's faith.
[time=2958] Faith in God.
[time=2959] The evidence of things not seen.
[time=2961] Abel's like, man God, I don't get this.
[time=2965] Maybe as his brother is beating him to death, literally.
[time=2975] Bad circumstances accompanied Abel's confidence in God's vindication.
[time=2980] His blood cries out from the ground.
[time=2986] Verse 4, Hebrews 11 says, through his faith, Abel's faith, though he died, he still speaks.
[time=2991] Abel's murder was not averted by his faith.
[time=2997] I say all this, friends, to give you hope, to give you encouragement, to give you confidence.
[time=3001] If you are in a bad circumstance today, but your faith in God is not misplaced.
[time=3009] Your faith in God is not in vain.
[time=3012] Christ is for you.
[time=3014] He has gone before you.
[time=3015] He is with you.
[time=3018] Enoch, verse 5, didn't even die.
[time=3022] Enoch lived and never died.
[time=3026] God just took him up.
[time=3028] It's an amazing story.
[time=3030] It says he walked with God and was no more.
[time=3034] So Abel and Enoch, they're both commended for their faith.
[time=3038] Enoch never died.
[time=3040] Abel was murdered by his brother.
[time=3043] Both had faith.
[time=3045] Is one more commendable than the other?
[time=3048] No.
[time=3050] They're both commended for and by their faith.
[time=3053] Abel is a second generation human.
[time=3057] He was commended for his faith, justified by his faith, not by works.
[time=3062] He trusted that what God said was true and he obeyed.
[time=3065] His faith produced right conduct.
[time=3068] Look at Hebrews 11, verse 3 in conclusion this morning.
[time=3072] "By faith we understand that the universe was created by the Word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible."
[time=3085] Number one in your notes was conviction.
[time=3088] Number two was commendation, receiving a good testimony from God.
[time=3093] And three is creation.
[time=3099] Only God can and does give life to things that don't exist.
[time=3106] That's in your notes.
[time=3107] Only God can and does give life to things that don't exist.
[time=3112] He makes a way in the desert, streams in the desert.
[time=3116] If anyone is in Christ, he or she is a new creation.
[time=3123] Your presence is heaven to me.
[time=3124] I can't tell you how true that is.
[time=3128] And it doesn't say that you're like a new creation when you're in Christ.
[time=3131] It says that new creation has come to be within you and you are a walking around.
[time=3137] Consider this.
[time=3138] You are a walking around display of what it will be like when Christ returns and makes all things new.
[time=3145] Because the Holy Spirit lives within you.
[time=3147] So what comes out love and joy and peace and patience?
[time=3153] Your presence is indeed heaven to me because he lives inside of you.
[time=3160] Only God can do that friends.
[time=3162] Only God can give life to things that don't exist.
[time=3167] John chapter 1, turn back to the Gospel of John with me, John 1.
[time=3172] It is impossible for us to have to exaggerate about Jesus.
[time=3179] I'll repeat myself.
[time=3182] It is impossible to exaggerate about Jesus.
[time=3186] When Hebrews begins with he's the radiance of the glory of God, he is the exact imprint of his nature.
[time=3193] How can I exaggerate?
[time=3195] Listen to John's Gospel.
[time=3198] In the beginning was the Word.
[time=3200] This is Jesus.
[time=3201] The Word was with God.
[time=3204] He was in the beginning with God.
[time=3206] All things were made through him and without him was not anything made that was made.
[time=3216] Skip down to verse 9 of John 1.
[time=3219] The true light which enlightens everyone was coming into the world.
[time=3222] He was in the world and the world was made through him and the world didn't know him.
[time=3226] He came to his own.
[time=3227] His own people didn't receive him, even his own family, verse 12.
[time=3231] But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,
[time=3238] who were born out of the blood of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God.
[time=3242] And the Word became flesh and made his tabernacle among us.
[time=3246] And we have seen his glory, glory as the only son from the Father full of grace and truth.
[time=3255] Only God can do this.
[time=3262] All these people were commended in Hebrews 11, but they didn't receive.
[time=3268] They didn't get what they were promised.
[time=3269] They didn't get Jesus.
[time=3272] And so the author of Hebrews lays this out in chapter 12.
[time=3280] Look at Hebrews 12 with me real quick.
[time=3282] Turn the page.
[time=3283] Go back to Hebrews in chapter 12.
[time=3286] What is the first word of Hebrews 12?
[time=3290] I'm sorry.
[time=3292] Therefore, wherever you see the word therefore, you should always ask what it's there for.
[time=3298] All these things, all these people, so what?
[time=3302] Since we are surrounded with a great cloud of witnesses, all those people, let's lay aside
[time=3308] that weight and the sin which clings so closely.
[time=3312] Let's run with endurance, the race up before us, looking to Jesus, the author, the founder,
[time=3320] the pioneer, the perfecter of our faith, of our faith.
[time=3324] He's the object.
[time=3325] He's the end, the beginning, the everything in between.
[time=3327] He's the alpha and the omega.
[time=3330] Who for the joy set before him endured the cross, despising the shame.
[time=3334] You know what that phrase means?
[time=3337] He sees, crucifixion was a shameful thing.
[time=3341] The most shameful thing.
[time=3343] Roman poets said, I want the name cross to be removed from our ears, from our eyes, even
[time=3350] from our very existence.
[time=3351] It was so horrible.
[time=3354] Even the word itself was, it conjured up horrible things.
[time=3360] And please hear me as we close.
[time=3363] Jesus said, I love you so much.
[time=3369] The shame that I will endure is nothing.
[time=3373] I despise it.
[time=3377] I love you that much.
[time=3379] The shame that I will endure, the humiliation, the rejection.
[time=3385] I count it as nothing.
[time=3386] I despise it because he loves you.
[time=3394] I was talking with my parents last night.
[time=3398] My dad described coming to Christ in a chapel service at college when he was just twenty
[time=3405] years old.
[time=3407] I came to Christ in college the age of nineteen in September of ninety-two.
[time=3414] And I felt this peace with God.
[time=3416] I had never experienced my whole life.
[time=3418] I knew he loved me.
[time=3419] My parents had taught me that.
[time=3422] But it all became real to me that day.
[time=3427] Can I end with this verse?
[time=3429] It's Galatians two twenty.
[time=3430] You know this verse.
[time=3431] It's Galatians two verse twenty.
[time=3434] And then we'll pray.
[time=3435] If you want to come down and pray to receive Christ who loved you and gave himself for you, I'll be down front.
[time=3442] You don't have to talk to me.
[time=3444] You cry out.
[time=3446] God save me.
[time=3449] I have been crucified with Christ.
[time=3453] It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[time=3457] Listen, the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God
[time=3463] who loved me and gave himself for me.
[time=3467] There'll be people down here in front if you want to come pray with someone.
[time=3473] Let's pray as we close today.
[time=3476] Father in heaven.
[time=3486] Faith is the conviction of things not seen by it.
[time=3489] People of old were commended.
[time=3492] You created the universe by the word of your power.
[time=3497] Father I pray this morning.
[time=3499] If there's somebody inside of my voice, it's never trusted Christ.
[time=3505] They would do so today with the full knowledge of his love and his sacrifice on their behalf.
[time=3511] The only he could do what needed to be done.
[time=3514] They could be approved before you.
[time=3518] Please God give us grace today.
[time=3520] Thank you that you have grace and mercy and unceasing and unlimited measure.
[time=3526] Pray all these things.
[time=3527] I pray your blessing on these people.
[time=3530] For that you be glorified in this place.
[time=3533] In Jesus' name.
[time=3534] [AMEN]
