[time=1460] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1464] I love the last line that's on my life is in your hands.
[time=1468] I'd like to say our church is in his hands.
[time=1472] Our church is in his hands.
[time=1476] It's been interesting year as you guys just heard the announcement.
[time=1479] It's been interesting year with all the changes.
[time=1482] The confusion, the difficulties, the budgets, the staff turnover, attendance, all of those things.
[time=1489] It's been interesting.
[time=1491] But it's clear to see that Jesus is still king.
[time=1494] His gospel still changes.
[time=1497] His word is still true, and his love still is never ending.
[time=1503] With Jesus, we can take it.
[time=1505] And let's not forget, this isn't, oh no, the guy's not coming.
[time=1509] Oh, what are we gonna do?
[time=1511] Listen, this place has been doing some amazing things in the last year.
[time=1515] We had 300 kids at VBS.
[time=1518] Are you kidding me?
[time=1519] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1521] Yes, we are not a church.
[time=1524] Oh, we're in transition.
[time=1525] Oh, what do we do?
[time=1526] Jesus is the king.
[time=1527] It doesn't matter who's up here preaching the word.
[time=1530] It matters not to Jesus.
[time=1533] It doesn't matter.
[time=1535] This is a place of people, the people you, me.
[time=1538] We are the church.
[time=1540] Let's be the church.
[time=1542] Let's not wait and say, oh, when's the guy coming?
[time=1544] I don't know.
[time=1545] We'll just kind of see what's gonna happen.
[time=1547] Come on, church.
[time=1549] Jesus gave us our mission 2,000 years ago.
[time=1551] It's evangelism and it's discipleship.
[time=1553] That's simple, that easy.
[time=1555] In your workplace, at the school, wherever you're at, you can do those things.
[time=1560] We don't need a pastor to love people.
[time=1562] [AMEN]
[time=1564] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1566] Now, it'd be nice if you got one.
[time=1570] Let's get that thing moving.
[time=1573] But we don't need one because we have Jesus.
[time=1578] Now, you might say Christianity is messy.
[time=1581] Church is messy.
[time=1582] We've got messy prophets.
[time=1584] We've got messy kings.
[time=1586] We've got messes all throughout the Old Testament.
[time=1588] So much of the New Testament is written to clean up messes in the church.
[time=1593] It's messy.
[time=1596] What's really cool is how the Bible presents a glorious story, a very messy faith.
[time=1602] Church is just messy.
[time=1604] Lives are messy.
[time=1605] People are messy.
[time=1607] But thank goodness we have a Savior who wades deep into the mess.
[time=1612] Picks us up and never lets go.
[time=1615] So I step here today messy.
[time=1618] Real messy in Jesse, but completely clean in Christ.
[time=1625] Okay.
[time=1626] So that's not even my message today.
[time=1630] I just got fired up.
[time=1631] I'm so sorry about that.
[time=1633] If you're new, don't worry.
[time=1634] I'm not here next week.
[time=1638] If you're not like, I'm out here.
[time=1640] Exits are clearly marked.
[time=1642] Thanks for coming.
[time=1643] Here we go.
[time=1644] Several years ago, a movie hit the culture that I think goes around in high school.
[time=1647] It's called Toy Story.
[time=1649] Okay.
[time=1650] And this is the story of toys that come to life when all the grownups are away.
[time=1654] And it's kind of the story of this Andy is the boy who owns all the toys.
[time=1658] And he's having a birthday.
[time=1659] And so all the toys in his room are anxious and worried and nervous about what are the new toys that are coming into their little world.
[time=1666] What are the new toys that are going to maybe take their place as Andy's favorite?
[time=1671] And one toy does, and it's Buzz Lightyear.
[time=1674] And he's a space ranger bent on protecting the universe from the evil emperor Zorg.
[time=1680] That's Buzz Lightyear.
[time=1682] But there's something about Buzz that doesn't quite fit.
[time=1687] He has what I think, an identity issue.
[time=1690] See, he truly believes that he's a space ranger.
[time=1695] He thought he was something he wasn't.
[time=1698] He didn't know who he truly was.
[time=1700] And I brought a little clip just to kind of give you a sense of him realizing he had his identity
[time=1707] all wrong.
[time=1708] Take a look.
[time=1710] Buzz, talk about it.
[time=1712] Buzz Lightyear responded, read you loud and clear.
[time=1715] Buzz Lightyear, planet Earth needs your help.
[time=1718] On the way.
[time=1719] Buzz Lightyear!
[time=1721] The world's greatest superhero now.
[time=1722] The world's greatest toy.
[time=1724] Buzz has it all.
[time=1726] Blocking, miscommunicator.
[time=1727] Going, Buzz Lightyear!
[time=1729] Come on, in action.
[time=1730] We're pulsating laser lights.
[time=1732] Oh, my God!
[time=1733] Multifraze, boy simulator!
[time=1735] It's a secret mission in uncharted space.
[time=1739] Hey, best of all, high pressure space wings.
[time=1742] Go in the city and beyond.
[time=1745] Not a flying toy.
[time=1746] Get your Buzz Lightyear out your finger and save the galaxy near you.
[time=1750] Buzz Lightyear!
[time=1751] Available at all, house toy mountain outlets in the track down here.
[time=1757] Welcome back to the boy management bowling championship.
[time=1760] I'm excited to be here.
[time=1762] Out among the stars I've seen.
[time=1767] Way beyond the moon.
[time=1771] In my silver ship I've seen.
[time=1776] I dream it ended too soon.
[time=1780] Now I know exactly who I am.
[time=1785] But I'm here for you.
[time=1787] You are a toy you can't find.
[time=1792] And I will go sailing.
[time=1798] No more.
[time=1805] But no, it can't be true.
[time=1809] I can find if I wanted to.
[time=1812] I can burn in the sky.
[time=1815] For the lead and the fly.
[time=1818] What a fly.
[time=1820] Go in the city and beyond.
[time=1839] Clearly I will go sailing.
[time=1848] No more.
[time=1851] When we don't know who we truly are we can't fly.
[time=1868] When we don't know who we are we can't truly live.
[time=1871] When we don't know who we are it opens the door for others to tell us who we are.
[time=1876] And I believe in this world today there were thousands or millions of advertisements and influences from every angle to try to tell us who we are or who we're not or what we should be.
[time=1887] There's all forms of media to attack us and disciple us.
[time=1893] Men and women if you have kids your kids are being discipled.
[time=1897] Whether you know it or not.
[time=1900] Raise that voice of Jesus a little louder in the homes.
[time=1904] That's extra.
[time=1905] The changes in our nation are causing great confusion and they involve truth, gender, sexuality and so many others.
[time=1913] And I believe those influences are seeping into Christian lives and Christian churches all over the globe.
[time=1921] Because we don't know who we truly are.
[time=1924] We have lost our identity.
[time=1927] Henry now in an author Catholic priest shares that every person is hounded by a single question throughout their lives.
[time=1933] Who am I?
[time=1938] He believes that there are three ways we seek to answer this question but they all fall short.
[time=1943] I think what happens a lot of times and so to see is we try to answer that question.
[time=1947] Who am I?
[time=1948] I am what I do.
[time=1950] I am what I control.
[time=1952] I am what others say about me.
[time=1955] However those are just those aren't going to satisfy.
[time=1958] Those are not going to accurately answer the question who am I?
[time=1962] So today my message today is this.
[time=1965] I'm going to give us or remind us of our identity.
[time=1970] I'm going to give us a new identity today or remind us of where our identity is centered.
[time=1976] So here it is.
[time=1977] Here's the whole message.
[time=1978] If you're writing something down, you want to type something down, you want to type something into your phone.
[time=1982] This is the whole message.
[time=1983] This is the answer at the end of the test.
[time=1985] This is the answer key.
[time=1986] This is the center of the message.
[time=1988] Here it is.
[time=1989] You are.
[time=1991] Or I am.
[time=1992] Say this in your head.
[time=1993] I am created, redeemed, and called to live as God's precious child in Christ.
[time=2001] That's the message today.
[time=2003] I am created, redeemed, and called to live as God's precious child in Christ.
[time=2012] And I believe that if you're at home watching, you're online watching us live, that you can know who you are.
[time=2018] You can know where your identity is centered.
[time=2020] The truth is that we are created, redeemed, and called to live as God's precious child in Christ.
[time=2027] So, to start, I want to look all the way at the beginning where our origin comes is Genesis chapter 1.
[time=2033] If you want to flip there, turn there, swipe, tap, get to Genesis 1.
[time=2037] Because we can't have an identity disconnected from our Creator.
[time=2042] Where we come from matters, our origin matters.
[time=2045] God and His love was in perfect relationship.
[time=2048] Triunity, Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
[time=2051] Triune God, He decides to create.
[time=2055] Let's look, Genesis chapter 1 says this.
[time=2059] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[time=2062] Now, the earth was formless and empty.
[time=2064] Darkness was over the surface of the deep.
[time=2066] And the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
[time=2070] And then it goes into the cadence of, "And God said, let there be.
[time=2075] And God said, let there be.
[time=2079] And God said, and God said, and God said.
[time=2082] And our God, our Creator, He speaks things into existence.
[time=2089] He spoke us into existence.
[time=2091] He spoke all the animals and all the fruit, all the things that crawl along the ground.
[time=2094] He speaks these things into existence.
[time=2099] And then something big happens in the cadence.
[time=2105] Something new comes onto the scene.
[time=2108] Verse 26, Genesis 1, 26.
[time=2111] "Then God said, let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish and the sea and the birds and the sky over the livestock and all the wild animals and over all creatures that move along the ground."
[time=2127] Verse 27.
[time=2128] So God created mankind in His own image, in the image of God He created them, male and female He created them.
[time=2137] Our identity is connected to, is centered in the foundational truth that God created us.
[time=2144] I am created and redeemed and called to live as God's precious child in Christ.
[time=2149] Now many people say, okay, I think I'm not sure about what kind of God.
[time=2155] I'm not sure about it.
[time=2156] Somebody created all this stuff.
[time=2157] So yeah, God created.
[time=2159] That's cool.
[time=2160] But it's not enough just to say God created.
[time=2162] So we can't stop there.
[time=2163] We have to go one more step because it says in His own image, man has kind of stamped, uniquely stamped with the likeness and the image of God.
[time=2173] That sets us apart, that sets us differently from everything else that God created.
[time=2181] We have a unique standing with God.
[time=2184] Our identity is connected to the fact that He created us in His own image.
[time=2191] Now I've studied that passage before in His own image.
[time=2193] What does that mean?
[time=2194] I'm not exactly sure in how we made it.
[time=2197] How does that look like?
[time=2198] We hold a picture of God, a picture of us.
[time=2200] We kind of see the resemblance.
[time=2201] I'm not sure.
[time=2202] But I think it has something to do with our capacity to love.
[time=2205] Our capacity to think and make choices, right?
[time=2209] There's something about us that is in His image, in His likeness.
[time=2213] And that is awesome.
[time=2215] That is how we are connected in our identity.
[time=2217] And if you hear nothing else today, if you check out after this, please hear this.
[time=2224] You matter.
[time=2229] All of this matters, who you are matters.
[time=2232] God declares you matter, simple because He created you in His image.
[time=2240] God created us in His image.
[time=2247] Teenagers, young adults, adults.
[time=2251] You don't need another person to complete you.
[time=2256] Our identity gets lost when we try to find it in other things that aren't God.
[time=2263] So when you're on social media, or you're looking to see if anyone likes your selfie posts, or how many followers you have, remember you created in the image of God.
[time=2275] And because of that, you have this thing that I like to call intrinsic value.
[time=2281] It's value just because.
[time=2283] It's value that doesn't change.
[time=2284] It's an error.
[time=2285] It's innate.
[time=2286] It's inborn.
[time=2287] It's natural.
[time=2288] It's deep rooted.
[time=2289] It's deep seated.
[time=2290] It's ineradicable.
[time=2291] I had to look that up.
[time=2292] I was unable to destroy or remove.
[time=2295] It can't be separated from you because it's from God.
[time=2300] You have this unrivaled worth and value because you're created in His image.
[time=2306] And our identity is built on that.
[time=2310] We are, I am.
[time=2311] You are.
[time=2312] We are.
[time=2313] I'm created, redeemed, and called to live as God's precious child in Christ.
[time=2317] What is amazing and powerful truth is that is, Genesis 3 happens.
[time=2323] The train wreck in the garden, Adam and Eve decide to be their own God.
[time=2329] And sin enters, and all its destructive consequences, including causing man to lose his identity.
[time=2338] Our position has changed with God at that moment.
[time=2344] We no longer can interact with the Holy God.
[time=2346] We are disconnected from our Creator.
[time=2348] We lose our true identity.
[time=2351] But that's not game over.
[time=2353] That would be a horrible message.
[time=2355] God created you.
[time=2356] You have value, but good luck.
[time=2359] You're broken, and there's no way to fix you.
[time=2362] Let's see.
[time=2363] That's the beauty.
[time=2364] It's not game over.
[time=2366] Our beauty and our value in the eyes of God has not changed.
[time=2369] Our position has changed.
[time=2370] We can no longer walk and talk with God like we could.
[time=2374] But church.
[time=2376] But grace exists to deal with our rebellion and the cosmic train wreck that happened in the garden.
[time=2384] In spite of the reality of our sin, we can anchor our identity and the transforming truth that Christ came not to condemn the world, but to seek and redeem that which was lost.
[time=2399] It's not game over.
[time=2401] So I want to jump to Ephesians chapter 2.
[time=2403] If you're turning and you're looking and you're flipping and you're swiping, go to Ephesians chapter 2.
[time=2408] I was Genesis chapter 1 in God's image in his likeness.
[time=2412] We are created.
[time=2413] Our identity is connected to our Creator.
[time=2419] Now, there is a theme that Paul uses in many of his letters, specifically in Ephesians, but most of his writing has this theme.
[time=2429] Most of Paul's writing, he wrote most of a lot of the New Testament, and usually he was addressing some kind of crisis or some kind of question or some kind of uprising in the church.
[time=2439] But in Ephesians, he's most likely writing to newer believers.
[time=2443] This Jesus thing is kind of new to them.
[time=2445] They're figuring it out.
[time=2447] Probably from a pagan or Jewish background who are being tempted to go back to their former sinful eyes or to go back to an identity that's not them.
[time=2458] And Paul's letter was used to remind them an encouraging word of who they are in Christ.
[time=2463] See, now this theme, it's in Christ.
[time=2466] Paul uses in Christ in him or in the beloved 12 times overtly, 22 other times in various forms.
[time=2474] And if we were to scan the rest of the New Testament, we would discover the phrase "in Christ" or its various forms would occur 216 times in the writings of Paul.
[time=2484] This was important to Paul.
[time=2486] It's a central theme of Paul, and it's our centering principle as it relates to identity in Christ.
[time=2491] This idea, this theme, in Christ, this is what changes everything.
[time=2496] Remember in Genesis, created with beauty, created with value, created with worth, sin happens, our position changes.
[time=2505] Now this theme in Christ changes all of that.
[time=2509] It can change our position.
[time=2510] It changes who we are.
[time=2512] Let me read Ephesians 2, beginning in verse 2.
[time=2517] As for you, you are dead in your transgressions and sins.
[time=2520] In which you used to live when you follow the ways of this world and the ruler of the kingdom of the air.
[time=2526] The Spirit who has not worked and those who are disobedient, all of us lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts.
[time=2536] Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath.
[time=2541] Now, at the Ball State University, my professor, Dr. Ashby, kind of characterized it by this.
[time=2547] On one side of this, you're going to see this thing called in Adam.
[time=2551] And 1 Corinthians 15, 22 says this, "As in Adam all die."
[time=2557] So it's kind of these two sides of the coin here.
[time=2560] In Adam, we're dead.
[time=2563] We're spiritually dead.
[time=2565] We cannot serve.
[time=2566] We cannot please.
[time=2567] We cannot talk with.
[time=2568] We don't have the position of being in holy relationship with God any longer.
[time=2574] We're dead.
[time=2575] That's old man.
[time=2576] That's in the flesh.
[time=2577] And from that passage, we're dead in our transgressions.
[time=2580] We walked according to the pattern of this world.
[time=2583] We gratified the cravings of our sinful desire.
[time=2588] We are objects of wrath.
[time=2591] You see that on the screen.
[time=2592] We're dead.
[time=2593] We're old.
[time=2594] That's the old way.
[time=2595] That's in Adam.
[time=2596] That's in the garden, chapter 3, Genesis 3.
[time=2599] But here's where everything changes.
[time=2603] Here's where our position goes from dead to life.
[time=2606] But because of his great love for us, I mean, Ephesians 2-4.
[time=2611] God who was rich in mercy made us alive with Christ.
[time=2615] Even we were dead in transgressions.
[time=2617] It is by grace who had been saved and raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus.
[time=2625] In order that in the coming age he might show the incomparable riches of his grace expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
[time=2633] Here's the theme.
[time=2634] For it is by grace you have been saved through faith.
[time=2637] This is not of yourselves.
[time=2638] Remember because you're dead.
[time=2640] Can't do anything when you're dead.
[time=2642] It is the gift of God not by works so that no one can boast.
[time=2646] See now on the other side we have in Christ.
[time=2648] That theme I told you about that Paul uses in Christ.
[time=2652] We are alive in Christ.
[time=2657] We have the Spirit.
[time=2658] We were raised with Christ, seated with Christ, saved by grace, created for good works, made new, granted peace reconciled.
[time=2668] We were dead in sin, separated from God physically, spiritually and eternally.
[time=2674] And there was nothing we could do.
[time=2676] Dead.
[time=2681] We could do nothing to save ourselves but Jesus comes on the scene in human history as our
[time=2689] perfect substitution.
[time=2691] And he communicated God's love to us and did what we could not do for ourselves.
[time=2698] He was born of a virgin, lived a perfect sinless life of submission to the Father.
[time=2702] He lived the life we could not live because we were dead.
[time=2708] Jesus allowed himself to be arrested and tried.
[time=2711] And the God the Father took our sin, our mess, past, present, future.
[time=2718] And he put it all on Jesus.
[time=2721] And he punished him in our place.
[time=2726] Three days later Jesus rose from the dead proving sin no longer has a hold on him.
[time=2732] And he now invites us, his created ones, to turn away from sin.
[time=2737] To be redeemed, to turn to Jesus and receive his eternal life in Christ.
[time=2745] Instead of us having to pay for our sins, which we can't because we're dead.
[time=2749] He gives us his life, his righteousness, his standing.
[time=2753] He gives us our identity in Christ.
[time=2757] When we go from in Adam and we walk over and we surrender our life to Christ, we go to in Christ and our identity is now centered in that we are created.
[time=2767] And when you do that you're redeemed and he calls us to live his precious child in Christ.
[time=2774] That's the power of Jesus Christ.
[time=2780] And this isn't religion, not talking religion.
[time=2787] Because religion starts with what are you going to do, how are you going to work your way up the ladder, right?
[time=2792] I have to be good enough, nice enough, go to church enough, eat my vegetables, get good grades, score all the points in basketball soccer, what all that stuff is.
[time=2800] If I just change my behavior then I might be good enough.
[time=2804] See that's not the question.
[time=2805] At the summit this week, Thursday, Friday, Bill Heibels, he was on a plane.
[time=2809] He tells the story, he's on a plane.
[time=2811] And this guy sits down and they're talking a little bit.
[time=2815] And the guy says, "What do you do?" and Bill says, "I'm a pastor." That's like everybody who doesn't go to church worst nightmare, I guess.
[time=2823] I don't even tell people, I just say, "I'm a consultant." I don't want to shut down right away.
[time=2831] Anyway, I may fib, Jesus forgive me, I fib look.
[time=2834] But I'm kind of a consultant, it's kind of spiritual consultant anyway.
[time=2837] So the guy kind of says, you know, he kind of slowly kind of starts, you know, I think I'm okay.
[time=2843] I go to church twice a year, I give some money.
[time=2845] I think, you think I'm okay?
[time=2846] The guy kind of starts to draw Bill out a little bit.
[time=2848] And Bill draws this.
[time=2850] He said, "Here's God." Okay, and he's perfect.
[time=2856] All right, now, here's the scale.
[time=2859] Really bad.
[time=2862] Who are some good people that you think would, you know, where do you think you land?
[time=2867] And Bill talks about, the Marylaid does all the good stuff.
[time=2871] And he says, "She's probably, you know, pretty good." And Bill puts himself, you know, just under her.
[time=2875] And the guy's like, "I'm probably right under you." But the point of the thing is, is we can't be good enough.
[time=2882] That's not what it's about.
[time=2883] That's not what church is about.
[time=2884] It's not about being good or perfect, because look, there's the standard.
[time=2889] Here's the standard.
[time=2891] They're not listening.
[time=2892] Here's the standard.
[time=2894] Right?
[time=2896] Where we just put you there, doesn't matter, because here, look, we have Jesus.
[time=2901] Now, we're up here.
[time=2902] We get to be with God.
[time=2903] We get to be holy and blameless in his eyes, right?
[time=2906] That's pretty cool.
[time=2907] I guarantee that this is being drawn in every church all over because Bill wrote it at the
[time=2913] summit.
[time=2914] I guarantee it, it just happened.
[time=2915] So I had to be, I had to follow the line.
[time=2916] But it worked.
[time=2917] I was like, "Oh, I don't work perfect for a message.
[time=2918] Awesome." Okay.
[time=2920] "I'm created and redeemed and called to live his God's precious child in Christ." That's your identity today.
[time=2924] That's who you are.
[time=2927] Now, I want to do a couple of things real quick.
[time=2931] I'm going to read a few things.
[time=2933] If you look at this, if you look on the Scriptures, when you go from death to life, and you go from in Adam to in Christ, some things happen, and the Scriptures say there are some things true of us, because where identity is centered, all these things become true of us.
[time=2947] Let me just read a few.
[time=2948] I am completed by God.
[time=2950] I am a member of Christ's body.
[time=2951] I am God's child.
[time=2952] I am a citizen of heaven.
[time=2954] I am hidden with Christ.
[time=2956] I am prayed for by Jesus Christ.
[time=2958] Do you know that Jesus is praying for you because of where you're identity, because of
[time=2964] who you are?
[time=2965] I'm God's coworker.
[time=2966] I am God's workmanship.
[time=2967] I am secure.
[time=2968] I'm a dwelling for the Holy Spirit.
[time=2969] I am being changed spiritually.
[time=2972] Banned.
[time=2973] Come on up.
[time=2974] I am not alone.
[time=2975] I am growing.
[time=2976] I'm not in want.
[time=2979] I am chosen and dearly loved.
[time=2980] I am set free.
[time=2981] I'm a light in the world.
[time=2983] I am more than a conqueror.
[time=2984] I am the righteousness of God.
[time=2986] I am no longer condemned.
[time=2987] I am not helpless.
[time=2988] I am persevering.
[time=2989] I am protected.
[time=2990] I am born again.
[time=2991] I am delivered.
[time=2992] These are true of you.
[time=2996] I am victorious.
[time=2997] I am given God's glorious grace.
[time=3000] I am chosen for the creation of the world.
[time=3002] I am in Christ.
[time=3003] I am created, redeemed, and called to be God's precious child in Christ.
[time=3008] Let's say that together.
[time=3009] I am created and redeemed and called to be God's precious child in Christ.
[time=3016] Now, as the band begins to play, there's going to be some that come up on the screen.
[time=3020] I want you to save him today.
[time=3022] Before you leave, I think there's power when you speak truth to yourself, right?
[time=3028] So the first one is I am in Christ.
[time=3030] I think they're going to come up on the screen.
[time=3031] I am going to go ahead.
[time=3032] I am in Christ.
[time=3033] Here comes the next one.
[time=3035] I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful.

I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful. I am faithful
[time=3065] I am a. I am. I am. I am crucified. I am. I am. I am. I am. My identity is in Christ.
[time=3085] Say it with me. My identity is in Christ. Church, today you are created and redeemed
[time=3093] and called to live as God's precious child in Christ.
[time=3123] My song inside the storm. I never need another.
[time=3137] For me to live is Christ. For me to live is Christ.
[time=3150] God, I breathe your name above everything. Let it be. Let it be Jesus.
[time=3167] Let it be Jesus. From the rising of the sun. Let it be Jesus.
[time=3189] With all this said and done. I never need another. Jesus, there's no other.
[time=3203] For me to live is Christ. For me to live is Christ.
[time=3216] God, I breathe your name above everything. Let it be. Let it be Jesus.
[time=3230] Let it be Jesus. Should I ever be abandoned? Should I ever be in place?
[time=3244] Should I ever be surrounded by the fire and the flame? There's a name I will remember.
[time=3254] There's a name I will proclaim. Let it be Jesus. Let it be Jesus.
[time=3270] Let it be. Let it be for me to live is Christ. For me to live is Christ.
[time=3287] God, I breathe your name above everything. Let it be. Let it be Jesus.
[time=3302] Let it be Jesus.
[time=3319] What do you do with a message like that?
[time=3341] What do you think of where you have your identity tied in right now?
[time=3350] What are you centering your identity in right now?
[time=3352] It could be your kids, your job, your money, your money, your power, your fame, whatever
[time=3358] it might be. I want you to hold it in your fist. Get it in your fist right now.
[time=3362] Where is it that my identity or you feel like sometimes you get pulled that way?
[time=3366] Get the fist up. I know we all do it. Nobody's perfect.
[time=3369] Everybody get a fist up. We're going to surrender this morning.
[time=3373] This stage is a giant trash can. I borrowed this from Kevin or Kyle.
[time=3378] Forget who their name was. I want you to get it in your hand.
[time=3381] This is the application because on Monday it's not going to be there anymore.
[time=3386] You're going to be in Christ. You can do anything in Christ.
[time=3389] You can talk to that coworker. You can withstand that horrible boss.
[time=3393] You can do what you need to do. You can live out who you are.
[time=3397] Get your fist high at the same time. When you're ready, I want you to throw that away.
[time=3402] Throw it away. Surrender it to Christ. Go ahead. Go ahead.
[time=3405] Just start throwing them up here. Don't hit me, but just throw them up here.
[time=3408] Good. It's gone. You surrendered that. Live like you are created
[time=3415] and redeemed. Surrender that to him so you have to let go.
[time=3420] It's not a do-harder. I'm going to make this mount. I'm going to make this mount.
[time=3423] I'm going to ruin it. I'm going to work out. This is surrender.
[time=3426] Surrender that to Christ. Surrender your identity to him.
[time=3430] Live in him. Darren, sing us out.
[time=3433] [MUSIC - 74 seconds]
[time=3516] Amen. Our identity is in Christ, Church.
[time=3522] You are dismissed. Have a great week.
[time=3526] (Applause)
