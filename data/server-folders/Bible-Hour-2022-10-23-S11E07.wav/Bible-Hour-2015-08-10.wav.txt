[time=0] [MUSIC - 210 seconds]
[time=220] This took my sin, and my soul rose.
[time=228] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=368] >> Good morning.
[time=370] I was too busy down there to realize it was time to come preach.
[time=376] I'll take you back, that took me to a spot.
[time=380] [BLANK_AUDIO]
[time=386] Liberty Mennonite Church, just outside of Jackson, Michigan.
[time=391] [BLANK_AUDIO] That's saying everything, Darren Acapella.
[time=398] We had a token piano in the corner of the church.
[time=402] And once in a while, somebody that was really good would play it.
[time=406] But most of the time, we sang like that.
[time=410] How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me.
[time=416] I could sing that all day long.
[time=418] I tried to Google quick how old that song is.
[time=422] I don't know, I didn't find it.
[time=424] But it's old.
[time=426] And the beautiful thing about that is, is the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and how marvelous his love is, is timeless.
[time=434] It is absolutely timeless.
[time=438] And so we can sing how wonderful, how marvelous, we can sing it Acapella, we can sing it rocking it out, we can sing it however we want to sing it.
[time=446] But the truth is timeless.
[time=448] >> Yeah.
[time=450] Yeah.
[time=451] I guess I should tell you who in the world I am.
[time=455] I'm Rick Raber, I'm one of our elders here. I lead here with a team of 13 guys and our staff that work really hard to try to bring the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the forefront.
[time=467] And we're thankful that you've taken the time today, whether that's through the Bible hour, or whether that's through our online ministry, or whether you're physically here with us today.
[time=476] We're really thankful that you've given us the privilege of focusing with us
[time=482] on worship of how marvelous that God is.
[time=485] That's what we're here about this morning.
[time=487] We talk about gathering, we talk about gathering to engage, to encounter God.
[time=495] We also talk about connecting in smaller settings so you can get to know somebody.
[time=502] Jesse says circles are better than rows.
[time=505] And so when we get to this spot, we're all sitting here.
[time=507] Sometimes it's hard to get to know the person sitting next to you.
[time=510] So we gather to encounter God.
[time=512] We connect to engage in growth opportunities so you can speak the truth about the ugly of your life with somebody close to you.
[time=521] And then we go to enlarge his reach.
[time=524] Within a few miles of our campus right here around this at Georgetown in a couple miles, or Fort Wayne, or northeast Indiana, or we've got missionaries all over the world.
[time=535] We go to expand his reach, and that's our call.
[time=539] Gathering, connecting, and going.
[time=541] It's our mission focus here as a body.
[time=546] Today, I want to share with you something that actually came as a result of a conversation.
[time=552] Many of you have been in a conversation with me at some point in time, and I've asked you this question.
[time=558] So what's God teaching you, or trying to teach you?
[time=562] And I asked that to my friend Tom Cashin three weeks ago on a Sunday morning.
[time=567] And I want to tell you the very first thing that usually comes out of people's mouth.
[time=571] The very first thing is usually something about patience, waiting on him.
[time=578] What does it mean to let God do his business and me be waiting patiently for him?
[time=584] That's well over 90% of the time.
[time=587] That's the answer that I get.
[time=589] So when my friend Tom Cashin says, "Rick, it's five words."
[time=596] Five words, and I'm like, "Okay." He says, "As I have loved you."
[time=607] He said, "Rick, it's just messing me up." And so today, I asked Tom, I said, "You know what?
[time=613] I think that'll preach.
[time=614] I think we can talk about that.
[time=616] I think we can do that." So this morning, our subject today is something that has tremendous impact on two things.
[time=623] We cannot connect, and we cannot go without it being as I have loved you motivated.
[time=630] You can't.
[time=631] If you do, you're doing it out of the flesh, and it will not have the kingdom difference.
[time=636] It does not make the same difference.
[time=638] So today, as I have loved you, it's what we're going to talk about.
[time=644] It's one of the most significant human longings that we are all wired for.
[time=650] From creation, from us being created in the image of God, we long to love and be loved.
[time=659] To have that extended towards us.
[time=662] Unconditionally and in practical ways.
[time=665] But at the same time while we're created for that, it's one of the most difficult things
[time=671] that you can do.
[time=673] It's one of the most contrary to your flesh that you can do is to love somebody unconditionally
[time=680] and without expectations.
[time=683] It's not natural.
[time=686] So today, I did what everybody does in today's world.
[time=691] We go to the web to see what the world wide web has to say about this concept of love
[time=698] is.
[time=699] And I just put that in.
[time=701] Guess what?
[time=702] One point to be billion returns came back for love is.
[time=711] So do you think our culture, our world has anything to say about love is?
[time=717] Love is 1.2 billion times.
[time=722] It's interesting that the number one response, the number one response on Google for love
[time=729] is, first Corinthians 13.
[time=732] Love is patient.
[time=733] Love is kind from Bible gateway.
[time=736] The number one response on Google for love is.
[time=739] Now, right down the list, not far behind that, we got to a search that produced an outtake
[time=749] of the movie Frozen where Anna sings to Hans.
[time=755] Anna sings to Hans about her series of doors that have been slammed in her face.
[time=761] And she says this.
[time=763] Say goodbye to the pain.
[time=766] Say goodbye to the pain of the past.
[time=769] We don't have to feel it anymore.
[time=771] Love is an open door.
[time=774] Many sitting here this morning have pain of the past.
[time=778] Doors that have been slammed in your face.
[time=781] And it feels difficult.
[time=785] Another one that came up is a new children's book coming out this November called Love
[time=791] is Bubblegum.
[time=793] Love is Bubblegum and it's filled with stories from children about love.
[time=798] Love is.
[time=799] I want to share a couple of those with you this morning.
[time=802] This one's really good.
[time=803] If you want to learn to love better, you should start with a friend that you hate.
[time=810] Whoa.
[time=813] Catch that.
[time=814] That's from Nikki, a six-year-old.
[time=816] If you want to learn to love better, you should start with a friend that you hate.
[time=821] Think about how the ones that you want love the most for are the ones closest to you.
[time=826] And the ones that you cause to make the most pain towards at the same time are the ones closest to you.
[time=833] Bobbi, age seven, said this, "Love is what's in the room at Christmas when you stop opening
[time=843] the presents and just listen." Ah, yeah.
[time=850] Love is what's in the room at Christmas when you stop opening presents long enough to look around the people who cared enough to give you something to say they loved you.
[time=862] A seven-year-old and a six-year-old.
[time=865] I have the privilege of working at Northern Apex and API Alliance and so I did something this week that I surveyed our team.
[time=873] I went out on our production floor and I said, "Ladies, I need your help.
[time=877] I'm preaching Sunday." And I ask a real simple question.
[time=882] If you would sometime today just write out what the most significant act of love that's been
[time=889] done to you in your life.
[time=892] It's a really simple question.
[time=895] One shared how she was in seventh grade.
[time=898] Her father took the time each evening after dinner to help her memorize a portion of a play for a public speaking contest.
[time=906] You see, her dad had to quit school in the eighth grade.
[time=909] So reading was even difficult and he had to do it to care for his mom and siblings when his dad passed.
[time=916] So for him muddling through helping his daughter learned something was a big stretch but one
[time=923] that obviously made an impact over four decades later.
[time=928] Four decades, a dad helping a daughter memorize something.
[time=934] The acts are simple while the impact is clearly long-term.
[time=941] Another one shared the impact that her church had on her after the early and unexpected death of her son.
[time=949] Her son died.
[time=951] She didn't have the resources to bury him properly.
[time=954] The church rallied around her and paid for her son's funeral.
[time=959] An act of love.
[time=962] This one asked to even be anonymous to me.
[time=964] I don't know which one of my employees it came from.
[time=969] She counted while in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
[time=972] Her family was attacked and robbed and her daughter was pistol whipped.
[time=977] Her husband was shot at.
[time=979] They ended up at a hospital needing treatment and no resources and an insurance card from the U.S. was worthless.
[time=988] A woman came up to her and offered her everything in her wallet to do whatever it could to help
[time=996] with the cost of care.
[time=998] She said, "Why have healed from the pain that we experienced that day?
[time=1004] We will never forget the kindness of that woman who gave everything she had."
[time=1010] Powerful.
[time=1012] Actual simple while the impact is long-term.
[time=1017] Tim Keller just tweeted yesterday afternoon, "God's loving care comes largely through
[time=1024] the labor of others." You've heard it been said before, "We are Jesus's hand and feet.
[time=1032] We're Jesus with skin on here today." That's who we are.
[time=1035] We get the privilege of doing that.
[time=1037] We get the privilege of being that to somebody.
[time=1042] I just want to tell you, I deeply felt convicted about this this week.
[time=1048] It does us no good.
[time=1051] None.
[time=1058] To stand here and sing about Jesus, how marvelous.
[time=1062] It does no good for me to stand up here and preach for two hours.
[time=1065] I won't go two hours.
[time=1066] For us to be here two hours, let me say it that way.
[time=1070] Two hours on a Sunday morning and talk about Jesus, but it does absolutely nothing if the
[time=1077] other 166 hours during the week, that it doesn't make a difference in the way that you live your life.
[time=1085] It does us no good.
[time=1090] So as I hope we're clearly reminded today, this is your take home if nothing else you do, our call is to love like Jesus so that the world will know we're His followers.
[time=1105] So whatever form of Bible you have, if it's electronic, if it's one in your lap, if it's on your phone, flip to John chapter 13.
[time=1112] John chapter 13, 31, and that's where we're going to be in the passage today.
[time=1117] This isn't a really complex passage, but it's full of truth.
[time=1125] John chapter 13, verse 31.
[time=1133] When He was gone, Jesus said, "Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified
[time=1139] in Him.
[time=1140] If God is glorified in Him, God will glorify the Son in Himself and will glorify Him at
[time=1146] once.
[time=1147] My children, I will be with you only a little longer.
[time=1150] You look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now, where I'm going,
[time=1156] you can't come.
[time=1158] A new command I give you, love one another.
[time=1162] As I have loved you, so you must love one another.
[time=1168] By this, everyone will know that you are my disciples if you love one another."
[time=1176] Verse 36, Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?" And Jesus replied, "Where I'm going, you can't follow me, but you will follow later."
[time=1187] Peter asked, "Lord, why can't I follow you?
[time=1189] I will lay down my life for you." Then Jesus answered, "Will you really lay down your life for me?" Very truly I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times today.
[time=1203] Let me pray for us.
[time=1206] Heavenly Father, your word is living and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword able to
[time=1212] divide joints and moral.
[time=1216] Holy Spirit, we would just ask that this word of truth today.
[time=1221] Love one another as I have loved you.
[time=1224] That you, Holy Spirit, would impact the lives of each of us.
[time=1229] That we don't live and leave the same.
[time=1234] God, I pray that our love would overflow, that you, Holy Spirit, would work in our lives to tweak us to the simple things that you can make holy and make a kingdom difference.
[time=1245] Please, God.
[time=1246] It's in your name, we pray.
[time=1248] [AMEN] So let's look at this passage from John Gospel a little bit closer.
[time=1256] He says this right in verse 34.
[time=1259] He says, "A new commandment." This is a new commandment that I give to you.
[time=1264] So I want to remind you, the culture that he was in.
[time=1266] In this Jewish culture, there are over 600, usually the numbers thrown out.
[time=1271] 613 commands that they were supposed to keep.
[time=1277] Now, I know some of you young ones.
[time=1279] The last thing that you want is another rule to keep from your parents.
[time=1282] It's the same kind of thing for us.
[time=1284] Can you imagine for them in that day for Jesus to say, "Hey, I got another one for you."
[time=1291] A new commandment.
[time=1295] He said, "I got a new one." The first fill in the blank for you, letter A, is Jesus gives us his new commandment.
[time=1301] But the truth is, is it wasn't new.
[time=1303] It wasn't new.
[time=1305] It went all the way back to Deuteronomy chapter 6 when we talked about loving God.
[time=1311] "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength." That was a command that we were called to do Deuteronomy 6.5.
[time=1319] So that command wasn't new.
[time=1322] Neither was the command to love your neighbor.
[time=1326] Leviticus, which is a book I'm sure you've all read a lot recently.
[time=1330] Yeah.
[time=1331] Leviticus 19, 18 says this, "Do not seek revenge who, or bear grudge against anyone among your people.
[time=1340] But love your neighbor as yourself, I am the Lord." So neither one of them were a new command.
[time=1347] It wasn't a new command to love God, and it wasn't a new command to love one another.
[time=1351] So Jesus puts something in place and gives a whole new meaning to it.
[time=1357] Earlier in the Gospels, this concept of loving God actually is something that they tried to catch Jesus on.
[time=1365] They tried to hook him, they tried to catch him, and they tried to do it in Matthew chapter 22.
[time=1370] Matthew chapter 22, 34 through the end.
[time=1374] Listen to the very first phrase.
[time=1376] "Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees."
[time=1382] Catch that.
[time=1383] "Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees came up with an idea.
[time=1390] The Pharisees got together.
[time=1392] These guys failed.
[time=1393] They couldn't keep him quiet.
[time=1394] We got an idea.
[time=1395] We're going to test him." And so one of them, an expert in the law, verse 35 of Matthew 22, tested him with this question,
[time=1403] "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?" Jesus replied, "Love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind." This is the first and greatest commandment.
[time=1414] And the second is like it.
[time=1417] Love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=1421] All the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments.
[time=1427] It wasn't new.
[time=1430] I love what Romans chapter 13 says.
[time=1433] Romans 13, verse 8 through 10.
[time=1436] I don't think you'll see it up on the screen.
[time=1438] But let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another.
[time=1445] For whoever loves others has fulfilled the whole law.
[time=1450] The commandments, you shall not commit adultery.
[time=1452] You shall not murder.
[time=1453] You shall not steal.
[time=1454] You shall not covet.
[time=1456] And whatever other command there may be are summed up in this one command.
[time=1464] Love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=1467] Love does no harm to a neighbor.
[time=1469] Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
[time=1474] So this new commandment really wasn't new at all.
[time=1477] It was a meaning that Jesus wanted to pour into this.
[time=1483] The first was it was sacrificial love modeled after his own heart.
[time=1489] And your heart has to be tweaked in order for you to model it.
[time=1497] It produced a new heart made possible but a new covenant sacrifice of Jesus and through the transforming power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1503] I love Ezekiel where he says I will take out your heart of stone.
[time=1508] Some of you are sitting here this morning or watching and listening.
[time=1511] And your heart is hard as a rock.
[time=1514] There is no tender component among you.
[time=1518] And your opportunity to love is impacted because your heart is hard.
[time=1525] Ezekiel says I'll take out the heart of stone and I will replace it with the heart of flesh.
[time=1531] That only happens with the supernatural empowerment that comes from the Holy Spirit as a result of you accepting Christ.
[time=1541] Galatians 5 says the fruit of the Spirit is and the first one love.
[time=1547] Fruit of the Spirit is love.
[time=1548] It flows out of a changed life.
[time=1552] The only way that we can fulfill a new commandment to love one another is by the Holy Spirit
[time=1559] empowering us to love with the Jesus kind of love not the rich kind of love.
[time=1565] The truth is is every one of you have your own selfish love language.
[time=1572] You like to be loved the way you like to be loved.
[time=1580] Do you believe that?
[time=1583] You like to be loved the way that you want to be loved.
[time=1587] And so you have this agenda.
[time=1589] You come to relationships.
[time=1590] You come to your job.
[time=1591] You come to those people who need you.
[time=1594] And all of a sudden what you're doing is you're bringing your baggage of a hard heart or something that's hurt you
[time=1602] a way that you want to be loved and all of a sudden it becomes about you.
[time=1612] Because our call again remind you is to love like Jesus so that the world will know where it's followers.
[time=1618] He said to love one another and it was a new command.
[time=1622] But he gave a qualifier for it.
[time=1624] He gave a qualifier.
[time=1625] It wasn't just love one another.
[time=1628] Letter B is his qualifier was the five words.
[time=1634] As I have loved you.
[time=1638] Now most of us even as I talk to a few more people most of us the first thing that we're ready to do is talk about Jesus
[time=1646] sacrifice of the cross.
[time=1648] I want to make sure you understand in this chapter of John chapter 13 it's well before the cross.
[time=1656] It's well before the cross and it's past tense.
[time=1660] As I have loved you so you have to go back and you have to look at what Jesus had done to his disciples
[time=1667] and to those that he had encountered to understand what as I have loved you means.
[time=1677] I love this.
[time=1678] His model and method were distinct for those who wanted to follow him.
[time=1683] Think about it.
[time=1684] The majority of Jesus ministry was with and to people that were close to him.
[time=1692] You think about it.
[time=1694] They were in proximity.
[time=1696] They ate with him.
[time=1698] They fished with him.
[time=1700] They walked with him.
[time=1701] They listened to him teach.
[time=1702] They watched him go up on the hillside to pray.
[time=1705] He taught them to pray.
[time=1708] They watched him love the unlovely and they watched him work and interact with the difficult Pharisees and Sadducees.
[time=1716] But they were in proximity to him.
[time=1721] His love wasn't about a long distance relationship.
[time=1726] They could hear him.
[time=1728] They could talk to him.
[time=1732] One of my favorite names for Jesus, one that I love, is typically associated with Christmas.
[time=1741] It's once typically associated with Christmas and it's Immanuel.
[time=1746] Immanuel means God with us.
[time=1750] God with us.
[time=1752] Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us.
[time=1756] He became the incarnation.
[time=1758] We're meant to be God with people.
[time=1760] Jesus was skin on.
[time=1762] The incarnation.
[time=1763] That's what we're meant to be.
[time=1768] Author and lecturer Leer Bascalia, some people know him as Dr. Love, which is kind of an interesting thing, talked about a contest that he was asked to judge.
[time=1778] The purpose of the contest was to find the most caring child.
[time=1784] The winner was a four-year-old.
[time=1787] The winner was a four-year-old whose next-door neighbor was an older man who had just lost his wife.
[time=1796] Upon seeing the man cry, the little boy went to the old gentleman's yard, climbed into his lap and just sat there.
[time=1805] When his mother asked him what he said to his neighbor, the little boy said, "Nothing. I just helped him cry."
[time=1816] When you think about it, the acts are simple, but the Holy Spirit and the kingdom and the power of God is what takes and sanctifies the simple things that you do for your coworker, for your friend, what that looks like.
[time=1834] Our culture really has embraced the social media.
[time=1839] We've embraced the social media mentality in a significant way, and hear me.
[time=1846] You heard me already quote Tim Keller with a Twitter post, okay?
[time=1850] So just be clear.
[time=1852] I fall into that as well.
[time=1855] We friend and we like.
[time=1858] We treat, follow, and we retweet.
[time=1861] We produce hashtags at incredible rates.
[time=1865] We post images via Snapchat and Instagram and every other thing that you can think of.
[time=1873] But I would submit to you today that while social media can be a great way to connect and hear from others, it can lead us.
[time=1882] And I'm looking down here because they're younger, but it can lead all of us to a spot where we embrace things that are counterfeit intimacy.
[time=1891] They're counterfeit intimacy without proximity and without connectedness in a way that produces a thought that you have a lot of friends.
[time=1904] But the reality is, is you're still left lonely.
[time=1911] You can, you can serve Facebook all day long.
[time=1914] You can connect with 400 people.
[time=1917] And the truth is, unless it is as I have loved you kind of love, people leave lonely.
[time=1928] Let's face it.
[time=1929] Few really have 200, 300, 400.
[time=1934] You pick the number 500 friends.
[time=1937] Really? Jesus had three that were really close.
[time=1941] Twelve that were a little bit closer.
[time=1944] Don't fool yourself.
[time=1946] Don't let the world fool us into thinking that counterfeit intimacy is achieved by hundreds of friends who watch and follow you.
[time=1955] That is not what intimacy that reflects the character of Christ looks like.
[time=1960] It's not.
[time=1961] It can be really good.
[time=1963] I get encouraged by Tim Keller. I get encouraged by John Piper.
[time=1967] John Piper has 750,000 followers on Twitter.
[time=1973] Seriously.
[time=1978] Our own Curtis Smith, he and I have talked about this recently.
[time=1981] I don't know if he's here this morning.
[time=1985] He has 16,000 people following him.
[time=1988] A lot of young people.
[time=1992] It matters.
[time=1994] We talked about the fact that it gives him a chance to give people that may not know Jesus, a glimpse of hearing aid trips to Africa or Haiti.
[time=2007] See, all of us have a sphere.
[time=2009] And it's not 400 or 500 for most of you.
[time=2012] It's a few.
[time=2014] Make a kingdom difference.
[time=2017] Whatever your area of involvement or influence, we have to choose to engage, to step into their world, to step to where they're at.
[time=2026] And respond with the model of ads I have loved you, Jesus kind of love.
[time=2031] The new commandment was to love one another.
[time=2034] The qualifier was as I have loved you.
[time=2038] Let's look at letter C in your outline, the examples of his love.
[time=2044] His example of love, letter C, small letter A was radical.
[time=2051] Radical.
[time=2053] In a culture that took and put people with leprosy outside the city.
[time=2065] In Luke chapter 5 verses 12 and 13, we get to see how Jesus,
[time=2073] not only was willing to step towards the lepro, understand this was they had to go around the city saying, "Unclean, unclean, unclean."
[time=2083] It's like walking around saying, "I'm a jerk, don't hang around me, whatever you want to fill in the blank, everywhere you go."
[time=2090] And on top of it, what they had was contagious.
[time=2098] And you see, Jesus went up and touched him.
[time=2104] He went up and touched him.
[time=2109] That's radical.
[time=2112] Let's go to John chapter 8.
[time=2115] Jesus, while he was standing and teaching, he was getting ready to teach.
[time=2123] And these guys thought they were going to do it again.
[time=2134] While Jesus was teaching the religious leaders, brought him a woman in adultery.
[time=2140] They brought him a woman in adultery trying to catch him.
[time=2145] You remember what the law said about adultery, right?
[time=2151] A woman caught in adultery was meant to be stoned.
[time=2155] It meant to be stoned.
[time=2159] There's one for you to Google a little bit.
[time=2161] Go and look at what it means to be stoned in that season and what it looked like.
[time=2166] It's not a pretty sight.
[time=2169] And he says to her, and he starts writing in the sand.
[time=2173] Nobody really knows what he wrote.
[time=2176] But as the accusers heard him say this phrase,
[time=2182] "You who was without sin cast the first stone."
[time=2189] Nobody was able to throw a stone and they dropped him.
[time=2196] He says, "Where are those who condemn you?"
[time=2202] And either do I condemn you, go and leave your life of sin.
[time=2207] Small letter B is that he was other centered.
[time=2212] He was other centered.
[time=2215] A little bit further back, you don't have to flip there.
[time=2218] But in John 4, he meets a woman at the well who had been through multiple marriages.
[time=2225] And he's willing to embrace and interact with her a Samaritan.
[time=2231] It was not a good thing for him to interact with a Samaritan, let alone a woman.
[time=2236] He was other centered.
[time=2239] Small letter C, he was convicting.
[time=2244] His love brought conviction.
[time=2248] With the woman brought before him as an adulter, he has called to the religious leaders of the day was he who was without sin cast the first stone.
[time=2258] And we know what happened.
[time=2260] They were convicted and they walked away.
[time=2265] Many times, those trying to trick him walked away in silence because of his response.
[time=2273] And I want to challenge you.
[time=2275] Some of you feel compelled in the apologetic arena to make sure that you make a stand for the gospel.
[time=2283] Jesus' stand for the gospel was not belligerent, it was always full of grace seasoned with salt, so it was pleasant to hear it.
[time=2294] But yet it was convicting.
[time=2297] Small letter D, he was scrutinized and condemned.
[time=2304] You get that?
[time=2305] He was scrutinized and condemned.
[time=2307] You know what they said?
[time=2308] They said it over and over.
[time=2310] He eats with tax collectors and sinners.
[time=2315] Wow.
[time=2320] Just for the record, I eat with sinners, not tax collectors every night at the raver table.
[time=2330] My sons and my wife and I need the grace of Jesus every day.
[time=2335] And I eat with tax collectors.
[time=2337] No, but sinners, yes.
[time=2342] I want to share with you a real life example of loved one another for our own body this week.
[time=2350] Some of you may know Jim and Kim Kimball.
[time=2354] Jim, how long have you been coming to Blackhawk?
[time=2357] I would say almost 20 years.
[time=2360] Has it turned on?
[time=2363] There we go.
[time=2367] A long time.
[time=2368] Yeah.
[time=2369] 20 years.
[time=2373] One of the things that you may not know about Jim is Jim has a diagnosis of something called Stills disease.
[time=2379] What do they classify that?
[time=2381] Is it an autoimmune, arthritis type?
[time=2382] An autoimmune.
[time=2383] It's an autoimmune, arthritic type of thing.
[time=2387] Jim's been battling this for how many years?
[time=2392] 15 years.
[time=2396] Jim, I ask him to share this because I want you to understand how vulnerable this is for Jim right now.
[time=2402] What's some of the lies that the enemies tried to tell you in the last few weeks or months?
[time=2408] I'd say months.
[time=2409] The biggest lie is my employer does not believe I'm doing a good job.
[time=2421] Because I am not at work.
[time=2424] I haven't been to work since March.
[time=2426] Hasn't been able to work since March?
[time=2430] I would talk to my boss, you know, and get that reassurance and then the devil would be
[time=2436] right back in there.
[time=2438] So then I would talk to his boss.
[time=2440] Yeah.
[time=2441] The devil would be right back in there.
[time=2444] And when you set it home and go from the couch to the chair or from the chair to bed, just
[time=2452] back and forth, you know, the devil has a lot of time because when you're in pain, you
[time=2459] don't feel like reading the Bible, you know, and it's just, it's terrible.
[time=2468] One of the lies that Jim also heard was that he shouldn't let the body be aware of their
[time=2474] needs.
[time=2475] That was a lie, wasn't it, Jim?
[time=2477] Yes, sir.
[time=2478] He didn't know what it looked like to let the body know what their financial needs
[time=2484] was.
[time=2485] See, you understand, he hasn't worked since March.
[time=2488] It doesn't have the income.
[time=2491] And so last Sunday, we just stood before a small community here, before one of the communities
[time=2498] that Jim and his wife, Kim, attend, and let them know of a need.
[time=2502] And all we challenged them was this.
[time=2505] Do what the Holy Spirit asked you to do for Jim and Kim Kim, if that's to write a letter,
[time=2511] if that's to make a phone call, if that's to send a card, if that's to write a check,
[time=2518] do what the Holy Spirit does tell you to do.
[time=2523] Just do it.
[time=2525] Jim and Kim had had some debt.
[time=2526] They had had some things that were needing to be paid, Jim.
[time=2530] Yes, sir, house payment.
[time=2532] Had house payment, they had several things.
[time=2535] Here's what I want you to hear.
[time=2537] We had no idea, that community had no idea how big the problem was.
[time=2543] None.
[time=2546] They get a check from Mark Orange.
[time=2549] And she starts filling out the bills, and she subtracts, and she fills out the bills and subtracts, and she fills out the bill and subtracts.
[time=2556] And Kim told me, when she got to the end of paying all the bills that were due, there
[time=2563] was 91 cents left.
[time=2567] And you're surprised.
[time=2570] You know what?
[time=2571] They didn't come from one person.
[time=2573] They didn't come from one individual that came from the body of Christ challenging each other and doing what they were prompted to do.
[time=2584] And guess what?
[time=2586] There were leftovers.
[time=2591] I'm thankful that Jim was willing to be here this morning.
[time=2594] We weren't sure he's going to be able to make it.
[time=2596] He's been really difficult.
[time=2598] You can't imagine above and beyond the monetary things that we've been given.
[time=2606] The love, care, and concern that we've been given here.
[time=2611] If you aren't in a small group and you attend here, you need to get in a small group.
[time=2618] You need that love and care from other people that you don't get when you just come and
[time=2625] sit and go.
[time=2627] Yeah, amen.
[time=2630] Praise God.
[time=2634] He says in his word, he does exceedingly abundantly beyond all we can ask or imagine according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.
[time=2642] And we, the Kimbles, we get the privilege of seeing leftovers.
[time=2651] The outcome of examples of us loving those around us is what's described in verse 35
[time=2658] and it's your last fill in the blank.
[time=2659] It's the evidence.
[time=2661] It's the evidence in verse 35.
[time=2664] All men will know.
[time=2667] Verse 35 says this.
[time=2669] By this, everyone, that's an all-encompassing word, and I don't care whether it's everyone
[time=2675] on the campus at St. Francis, I don't care if it's everyone on the campus of wherever you work at, play at, study at, do whatever you do at.
[time=2684] Maybe it's at Starbucks where you get coffee every morning.
[time=2690] It says by this, everyone will know that you are my disciples if you love one another.
[time=2699] Our modeling of the love of Christ is one of the ways that those around us watching and listening come to know that the Jesus kind of love is real and it's different than any
[time=2710] other civic or community organization that goes and hands out glasses or does other stuff because there's many people that do that.
[time=2720] But the truth is we are the body of Christ and we are meant to act like it and share the
[time=2726] name of Jesus as you do what you do as I have loved you, love them, ours is to be incarnational.
[time=2738] God with us laid out with those that you encounter.
[time=2744] The God that changed your heart from a heart of stone to a heart of flesh moving into the life of somebody that needs to have God with them.
[time=2759] What does it look like for us to step into the world of someone condemned by our culture
[time=2768] like a leper?
[time=2771] See our church culture is quick to do that sometimes.
[time=2780] Maybe yours is to the young man dealing with the shame of same sex attraction that feels as isolated and set aside as a leper.
[time=2791] Maybe yours is the gal struggling with being a single mom that doesn't know how to take
[time=2798] care of our kids and get a break at the same time.
[time=2806] Are you willing to let your busy life be interrupted by the things that happen around
[time=2812] you and then trust God to have them know that it's of Jesus and not you?
[time=2821] See we're so busy about being busy and we've got our next appointment to get to.
[time=2828] We won't be interrupted to do something.
[time=2833] Yeah.
[time=2837] Maybe it's showing care for an unsafe friend by something as simple as going to visit
[time=2844] her mom and the nursing home.
[time=2854] Maybe it's not being in such a hurry that you can't stop and help an older lady that just had open heart surgery change a tire.
[time=2863] See I want to be real honest with you this morning.
[time=2867] Thursday afternoon my temptation was to keep driving.
[time=2873] Because I had already changed the tire for once that day for my wife because nobody stopped
[time=2879] to help her change hers.
[time=2884] I confess I wanted to keep driving.
[time=2888] I wanted to keep driving but then the Holy Spirit said Rick if you don't do it why do
[time=2895] you expect anybody else to do it.
[time=2898] So I stopped and pulled over and her lady's name was Linda and she works at 100 Town Elementary School helping with after school care and she had just had open heart surgery not too long earlier.
[time=2909] She's got this little forward edge or something, I don't know what it was, 2013-2014 way newer than any car I drive and I go to try to help her change the tire.
[time=2919] And they've got one of these new fangled things for some reason.
[time=2921] They put this wrench and the jack thing in that's all stitched up nice and pretty felt.
[time=2928] And I'm like oh yeah this is where the wrench is at.
[time=2931] So I try to pull it out and it doesn't come out.
[time=2936] So I'm sitting here and I'm easily, it feels like five minutes probably wasn't but I'm trying to pull this thing out of the sleeve and I'm like this lady's probably thinking who in the world did you send to help me that can't even get the wrench out of the thing.
[time=2950] So I'm looking at it and it feels like there's a little pocket down here that might have like a spare lug nut or something in it.
[time=2957] And I just did, this wasn't a Rick thing, it was just a God thing.
[time=2961] All I said right out loud was Jesus you've got to help me get this thing out of here, I can't change your tire.
[time=2967] And literally that fast, literally that fast, I see a little slit and there's a bolt in
[time=2974] there.
[time=2975] And I pull it out and the wrench comes out and I change your tire.
[time=2978] But what she said next was profound, wow that was a fast answer to prayer.
[time=2991] Yesterday my neighbor asked us to help them, do something that I won't describe for you
[time=3002] because if we're on TV and you're all in a room and you're not all farmers.
[time=3010] He asked us if me and the boys would come help him.
[time=3013] And it wasn't going so well and there were gates that got broken and there were things
[time=3019] that weren't happening.
[time=3023] And here I am underneath of this animal down like this trying to reach through.
[time=3031] And it isn't going so well.
[time=3035] And so I say, Jesus you're going to have to help me get these things in there.
[time=3042] Guess what happened?
[time=3045] They went right in.
[time=3047] They were done and it wasn't because of righteous acts that Rick has done.
[time=3052] It was because I was trying to just do something, hear me please, hear me.
[time=3057] This isn't about me doing something.
[time=3059] It's about the simple acts that you go do for somebody that has a need and then you let Jesus show up to show that it's because of his love that it makes a difference in
[time=3070] your life so that you can make a difference in theirs.
[time=3072] And by the way, he's the one that shows up because clearly for several minutes I wasn't
[time=3078] able to get those things in there.
[time=3080] I wasn't able to figure out how to get the wrench there.
[time=3083] And you know what?
[time=3084] I'm a reasonably smart guy.
[time=3089] But when I work in the power of Rick, guess what you get?
[time=3093] You get the fruit of Rick.
[time=3096] But just a simple surrender to say, "Jesus, I need your help."
[time=3104] When we surrender the simple things we do to Jesus, he can make the difference.
[time=3109] He's the one who sanctifies the simple and makes them holy for his purpose.
[time=3118] People come to know the love of God and even our faith gets built.
[time=3123] I'm telling you, my faith got built in two simple prayers that didn't last ten seconds
[time=3129] this week.
[time=3131] Remember, our call is to love like Jesus so all will know we're his followers.
[time=3140] By this, all men will know that you're my disciples.
[time=3144] Let me pray as the choir comes up.
[time=3149] Heavenly Father, we know that there is 1.2 billion answers on the Internet for what
[time=3157] love is.
[time=3161] But God, we beg you today that you tweak our hearts, you tweak our minds, you take up our
[time=3170] spiritual antenna, please Jesus, that we see the tires that need changed.
[time=3180] We see the mothers that need to be visited in a funeral home, I mean in a nursing home.
[time=3187] Help us to see God with your eyes and love with your love, that the world will know what's
[time=3196] going on at Black Hawk.
[time=3199] Please Jesus, please Holy Spirit, I pray that you would paint this morning.
[time=3205] Paint this morning a face on everyone that's sitting here indelibly on their face in their
[time=3216] mind so they know who you want them to love that way.
[time=3222] And God, don't let go of them, don't let go of us.
[time=3226] Make up our business, Jesus, it's your name we pray, amen.
[time=3231] There'll be elders down front, if you want to come, confess, pray, do whatever you want
[time=3238] to do, ask for forgiveness, please feel free.
[time=3244] God, you are forsaken, I'm accepted, you are condemned, by the love and well your spirit
[time=3267] is within me because you died and rose again, I'm forgiven because you were forsaken, I'm
[time=3287] a love and well your spirit is within me because you died and rose again, praise you now,
[time=3309] help me, that you my King would die for me, amazing love, I know too, it's my choice
[time=3328] are you, in all I do, I am forgiven because you were forsaken, I'm accepted, you were
[time=3356] forsaken, I'm a love and well your spirit is within me because you died and rose again,
[time=3373] amazing love, how can it be that you my King would die for me, amazing love, I know too,
[time=3393] it's my choice are you, amazing love, how can it be that you my King died for me, amazing
[time=3414] love, I know too, it's my choice are you, in all I do, I am forgiven, I know I'm forgiven
[time=3443] you are my King, you are my King, you are my King, you are my King, you are my King,
