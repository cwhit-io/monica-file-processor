[time=90] [APPLAUSE]
[time=119] My name is Nicolette Walters, and I had a pretty rough childhood.
[time=124] My father was abusive to my mom, and it was just pretty chaotic.
[time=128] We had six kids in our family, and he was a drug addict and alcoholic, and
[time=134] it's just really chaotic.
[time=136] And so to kind of get through that, I think he just, as a former self-preservation,
[time=143] I just kind of numbed myself and put up these walls and, you know, just kind of wanted to hide.
[time=152] And a few years ago, I found myself just really numb.
[time=160] And I started getting involved in church, but still I would,
[time=166] after I put Ellie to bed, that was like the worst time.
[time=169] Everything was quiet, there was no one around, and I just felt this anxiety, this something inside me that was just, it was scary.
[time=177] And I knew that it was God trying to get me to come to him.
[time=182] I knew it.
[time=183] And I don't know why it seemed scary because God is good, but it just seemed like too much work or something.
[time=189] So I did start getting more involved in church at Black Hawk here, and I did a single parents' class with Lori, and that was really good for me.
[time=199] And then I started the truth project with Denny Treas.
[time=201] And I think that was really a big eye-opener, and it just helped me to trust that God is good,
[time=207] and that he is sovereign, and that he's there for me.
[time=210] And, you know, if I really do believe that, then why do I worry about things?
[time=215] So kind of right around that time, which obviously I think God had its hand in everything,
[time=221] and had me in those classes when I was about to experience this, I got this phone call from a girl that I had wronged.
[time=229] This was, you know, a year before, but she had just found out about it, and I got the phone call,
[time=235] and she asked me about this, and I'm just like, "I don't know what you're talking about." I hung up, and I didn't want to face it, but she was persistent.
[time=242] And I asked a couple of my friends, you know, like, "What do I do?" And they both were like, "Just deny it, you know, there's no proof." But there was just something in me that knew I couldn't do that, and I felt like God was saying to me, like, "If you do trust me, then do the right thing, and be obedient."
[time=261] And so it took me a couple of days to really kind of, you know, pray about it and work up the courage, so I called her, and I confessed to her, and I felt awful.
[time=271] And she just bestowed this mercy and grace on me, and she asked me why I had done it,
[time=281] and it wasn't to shame me, it was for me to really look at it and see what void I was trying to fill.
[time=287] And having that mercy on me really opened my eyes to how much God does that for us every day,
[time=297] that Jesus died for us while we were still sinners, not when we were like Paul, and we're on a mission, you know, telling the world about him.
[time=305] He died when we were still sinners, and it really changed me a lot.
[time=312] I mean, I would come to church, and I couldn't get through a song without crying, because I just felt so loved.
[time=317] And so I guess I really just wanted to encourage people if you are doing the same thing,
[time=325] while you think you're putting them up to keep out all the hard things and the bad things,
[time=332] but you're not letting anything good in either, and, you know, we were designed to be in relationship.
[time=337] We were not made to be alone, and I think it's important to get out and be connected and to serve.
[time=346] I work with children's ministry here, and just really blessed by it,
[time=352] and the more that you get out of yourself, you know, I look at my childhood, and it's sad.
[time=359] It is sad, but the more you look at it, the more you feel sorry for yourself, the more sad you get.
[time=364] But when you, like, I'm looking at these kids that I'm spending time with on Sunday mornings, and it just makes me happy, you know, even if, like, there were times, there were people in my life, when I was a kid, I would go to, and thank God for them, because I wouldn't have gotten through it, you know, just little snippets. So, you know, when I'm there with the kids and I'm helping, it just gets me out of that cycle of just kind of looking inward and feeling down.
[time=389] So, I just think it's really important to be in community with people.
[time=394] There's a song called "If We're Honest" by Francesca Batticelli, and it really spoke to me as I was preparing,
[time=401] and the lyrics say, "Truth is harder than a lie, the dark seems safer than the light,
[time=408] and everyone has a heart that loves to hide. I'm a mess, and so are you.
[time=413] We've built walls nobody can get through. It may be hard, but the best thing we could ever do
[time=419] is bring your brokenness and I'll bring mine, because love can heal what hurt divides and mercy is waiting on the other side." And it says, "Don't pretend to be something that you're not living life
[time=430] afraid of getting caught. There's freedom found when we lay our secrets down at the cross."
[time=436] And I think there's just a lot to that. You know, we're all broken, and we're all kind of ashamed of what we've done, and we don't want people to know because we think that it's terrible, but everybody's didn't, and I think that there's just a lot in that when we come together
[time=454] and we are open and vulnerable and let down our walls, we'll see that we can just, we learn a lot from each other and we can give each other mercy and grace, just like Jesus.
[time=466] [MUSIC - 154 seconds]
[time=624] And mercy's waiting on the other side.
[time=631] If we're honest, if we're honest, if we're honest, if we're honest.
[time=654] What a great moment of worship so far today, amen.
[time=659] Amen. The story by Nicolette was just really empowering.
[time=664] I mean, you look at that and we're talking about difficulties in life.
[time=667] And how many of us have difficulties in life?
[time=669] Let's be honest, we all do.
[time=671] And we do build up those walls.
[time=673] And the guys sang.
[time=674] Anybody else here want to run up and high-five every one of those guys after they got done singing today?
[time=678] The guys sang that sometimes it takes a mountain, sometimes it takes a desert.
[time=682] And the reason that it takes those things to get our attention is because we build up those walls.
[time=688] Amen? We do that. We're human beings.
[time=691] And we are designed to be in relationship.
[time=693] There's no question about that.
[time=695] But sometimes those relationships start to hurt.
[time=697] And so we build up those walls because we don't want to let somebody in.
[time=701] And sometimes it takes God to come through with a mountain or a desert.
[time=705] And if we are honest with ourselves, right, if we are honest, that's what it takes.
[time=711] And that's the reason God puts us through those things so that He can break down those walls.
[time=716] So great moment of worship so far, Darren and the team, thank you.
[time=721] Who did you serve this week?
[time=727] Who did you step outside of your comfort zone and serve?
[time=732] Guys, husbands, wives, that doesn't count.
[time=735] You can't say, "Well, I served my wife or I served my husband." That's part of the marriage package.
[time=740] You should be serving your spouse daily, multiple times daily.
[time=744] And in the movie fireproof, they talk about studying, right?
[time=748] Studying our spouse. You should be doing that.
[time=750] So when I ask you the question, "Who did you serve?" I'm not referring to that individual in your life because that should be natural.
[time=756] Who did you serve?
[time=758] Who did you step outside of yourself and serve this week?
[time=761] Maybe you stopped by to visit someone who needed to be visited.
[time=764] Maybe you took a plate of cookies.
[time=766] Love cookies, chocolate chip.
[time=768] Maybe you took a plate of cookies with you or had a meal.
[time=771] Maybe you cut their grass.
[time=773] Maybe you just went and sat down and were just there while they shared themselves.
[time=779] Who did you serve this week?
[time=785] Who did you pray for?
[time=787] Whose salvation did you pray for?
[time=789] Close your eyes for just a moment and think and envision that moment in heaven when you are there and you're looking around and you're excited and who is missing from that?
[time=799] Who in your life is missing from that?
[time=802] Did you pray for them?
[time=805] Have you prayed for their salvation?
[time=808] Because see, we are Christians.
[time=811] We are Christ-like.
[time=813] We are disciples of Christ, followers of Christ.
[time=816] And that's what meant something to Christ.
[time=819] Christ cared about serving.
[time=822] Christ cared about the gospel and is spreading that gospel to those people.
[time=826] That's what Christ was about.
[time=828] And we as Christians, as disciples of Christ, should be doing the same thing every day.
[time=837] Don't let the busyness of life and the muchness of life that the evil one brings to us, that the enemy brings to us just because what he wants to do is he doesn't want us to act like Christ.
[time=850] He doesn't want us to be like Christ.
[time=852] He doesn't want us to serve others because when we serve others, others see the love of Christ, amen?
[time=858] They see the love of Christ and that's attractive to them.
[time=863] Satan doesn't want you to do that.
[time=865] Don't let the busyness of life cause that.
[time=868] Who did you serve this week?
[time=870] Who did you pray for?
[time=874] Now hopefully after today, after we have our times together, if they were ever allowed me to come back up here like next week, then I were to ask you that.
[time=884] Maybe you have a different answer.
[time=888] Because being a Christian means something.
[time=890] Amen?
[time=891] Being a Christian means something.
[time=897] Good morning.
[time=899] My name is Rich Taverni.
[time=902] And I have the privilege of serving on the Elder Board here at Blackhawk.
[time=905] It's a great experience.
[time=907] And I'd like to begin by simply saying welcome to Blackhawk.
[time=912] Thank you for being here.
[time=915] I got a little story I'm going to read for you today.
[time=917] I often read when I preach because I can't stand still that long.
[time=921] I'm back and forth, okay?
[time=923] And my wife won't let me carry my iPad.
[time=925] So I'll read it to you here real fast and then we'll move on.
[time=928] Jeffrey is a new Christian.
[time=930] Maybe this is you.
[time=932] He had been leading a life was completely focused on him and how he could manipulate others to his advantage.
[time=939] One day, Julia co-worker invited him to a special event at her church.
[time=943] Jeffrey hated church as he had gone as a child, but felt that there was so many rules and rampant hypocrisy that he stopped attending and never looked back.
[time=953] But Jeffrey respected Julie and decided to go with her mostly out of curiosity
[time=959] as it was a different denomination than he had known.
[time=961] And Julie always seemed so passionate about her faith.
[time=965] Jeffrey was captivated by his experience and decided to keep investigating as this place was different than anything he'd ever seen.
[time=972] He heard the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=974] That Jesus loved him and offered him a free gift of salvation.
[time=977] And if he would just accept that free gift, confess his sins and invite Jesus to be a savior that Jeffrey could join the family of God.
[time=985] As a new Christian, Jeffrey was suddenly faced with the reality of the battle between God's way and the way of the world.
[time=993] News headlines, stories, runaway corruption, and overt anti-God attitudes and propaganda have begun to discourage him.
[time=1001] A country built on biblical principles and possessed the heritage of one nation under God, no longer considered a Christian nation.
[time=1011] Even the church as a whole was changing its beliefs and teaching to better accommodate the views of the world and science.
[time=1022] Jeffrey began to ask questions.
[time=1024] Why is all this happening?
[time=1027] Where is our country headed?
[time=1029] Why do some churches and people seem to be turning their backs on the principles of the Bible?
[time=1035] How much worse does it need to get before Jesus comes back?
[time=1039] These are all legitimate questions.
[time=1041] Have you ever asked questions like that?
[time=1044] You ever pick up the newspaper or read a news feed and say to yourself, "How much worse does it have to get come, Lord Jesus, come quickly?" Do you ever ask those questions?
[time=1054] Well, today we're going to look at some questions.
[time=1056] If you have your Bible, please join me in Matthew chapter 24 as Jesus was holding class for the disciples.
[time=1063] And I called it holding class because I just recently retired 30 years as an educator, so having class is important to me.
[time=1070] Teaching is important to me.
[time=1072] Jesus was holding class with the disciples in chapter 24 of Matthew.
[time=1080] Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and his disciples came up to show him the buildings of the temple.
[time=1087] And Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these things?
[time=1090] Assuredly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another that shall not be thrown down." Now, as he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately saying, "Tell us, when will these things be?
[time=1104] And what will we decide if you're coming at the end of the age?" And Jesus answered and said to them, "Take heed that no one deceives you." For many will come in my name saying, "I am the Christ and will deceive many." And you will hear of wars, rumors of wars, see that you are not troubled.
[time=1124] For all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
[time=1129] For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places.
[time=1138] All these things are the beginning of sorrows.
[time=1143] Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.
[time=1150] And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another.
[time=1156] And many false prophets will rise up and deceive many.
[time=1160] And because of lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold.
[time=1166] But he who endears to the end will be saved.
[time=1171] And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.
[time=1178] Father in heaven, thank you for this day, and thank you for the opportunity we have to open your word.
[time=1183] As we take a journey through this passage, Lord, please help us to learn what you need us to learn.
[time=1188] Help us to understand our commitment to standing firm on your gospel.
[time=1192] We'll give you the praise and glory in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1198] Obviously, before chapter 24 comes, chapter 23, so we'll just lay a little bit of groundwork there.
[time=1202] If you look back in chapter 23, you don't need to do that now.
[time=1205] I'll just kind of tell you what happens.
[time=1206] This is after Jesus was in the temple, and he had just spent an enormous amount of time rebuking the scribes and Pharisees.
[time=1214] He was rebuking them for being arrogant, showing off and being self-righteous, and many other things.
[time=1220] Jesus was passionate.
[time=1222] Jesus was emotional when he was doing this.
[time=1224] Because these were the religious leaders of the time, and Jesus was anti-religious leaders of the time at that point.
[time=1232] Because they were doing things, and they were teaching things, and they were saying things that were totally inconsistent with the gospel of Jesus.
[time=1239] I don't know if you've ever seen any religious leaders that are teaching things that are not consistent with the Bible.
[time=1245] Have you seen that?
[time=1246] It happens a lot in our culture, and Jesus rebuked them.
[time=1251] He said seven times in that passage, "Woe unto you." "Woe unto you" is a horrible phrase.
[time=1258] It means grievous distress.
[time=1260] That's what Jesus was saying to these guys.
[time=1262] That's how bad they were doing the job according to Jesus.
[time=1265] "Woe unto you" seven times he said that.
[time=1268] Jesus was passionate because they're religious leaders.
[time=1272] We're not doing the job that they ought to be doing.
[time=1275] They weren't teaching the gospel.
[time=1277] And then the last verse of chapter 23, we see Jesus' heart for his people.
[time=1283] Listen to this.
[time=1284] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem.
[time=1287] The one who kills the prophets and stones, those who are sent to her, how often I wanted to gather your children together as a hen, gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.
[time=1297] See, your house has left you desolate.
[time=1299] For I say to you, you shall see me no more until you say, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=1305] After this recitation to all of the Pharisees, Jesus has got to be emotional because Jesus was human.
[time=1312] A lot of people say, "Well, Jesus was God." Amen, Jesus was God, but Jesus was also human.
[time=1316] And when you just spent a good amount of time rebuking a group of religious leaders, there's an emotion there.
[time=1324] And then as he's departing for the temple, he's just like Jerusalem, Jerusalem, my family.
[time=1329] For so long I wanted to bring you to me.
[time=1331] I wanted to gather you to me.
[time=1332] I wanted to love on you.
[time=1334] And you wouldn't allow it.
[time=1335] You wouldn't let me do that.
[time=1337] Jesus was heartbroken, frustrated the Pharisees and the religious leaders.
[time=1342] He was heartbroken because he wanted to bring his people to him and they would constantly reject him.
[time=1347] And that's where we lead us in to chapter 24 of Matthew.
[time=1352] And Jesus departed the temple.
[time=1354] His disciples came to him and saw the buildings of the temple.
[time=1357] I love this.
[time=1358] And they're like, "Did you see that?
[time=1359] You see the temple?
[time=1360] When Jesus was on the earth in his ministry, the temple of Jerusalem was one of the grandest structures in the world.
[time=1367] And they were showing off.
[time=1369] They're like, "Look what we've done.
[time=1370] Look what we can do as people.
[time=1371] We built this great structure.
[time=1373] I just want to remind you, he's telling that to the individual who's part of like creation of the world.
[time=1379] And creation of people.
[time=1380] And creation of all this.
[time=1381] Probably wasn't really impressed with the building.
[time=1383] You know what I'm saying?
[time=1385] But this is what the disciples are.
[time=1387] And sometimes I think, myself, that God is really impressed with what I can accomplish.
[time=1391] I'm telling you, God's not impressed with what I can accomplish.
[time=1395] I can do this with a computer.
[time=1397] I can do this with barbecue.
[time=1400] God's not impressed with that.
[time=1403] You know?
[time=1406] All right.
[time=1407] So that's what they were saying.
[time=1409] But listen to God.
[time=1410] To Jesus.
[time=1411] Do you see all these things?
[time=1413] Surely I say to you, not one stone should be left here upon another.
[time=1416] That shall be thrown down.
[time=1418] That phrase right there, Jesus is predicting.
[time=1421] He is prophesying the destruction of the temple of Jerusalem.
[time=1425] I'm sure the disciples, their ears perked up that clearly.
[time=1429] That's like a huge building.
[time=1430] How is this going to go about?
[time=1432] According to John MacArthur, some of the stones of this temple were 40 by 12 by 12 feet.
[time=1442] 40 by 12 by 12 feet.
[time=1446] This is not your normal house facade brick.
[time=1450] Okay?
[time=1451] These are huge.
[time=1452] And the disciples knew that.
[time=1454] And they're looking at them and they're saying, "Really?
[time=1455] This is going to be destroyed?
[time=1456] How's that going to happen?" Because that would take a job.
[time=1459] That would take a really catastrophic event for that to occur.
[time=1464] This has got to be going through the minds of the disciples.
[time=1469] But see what Jesus could see that they couldn't see was in the year 70 AD.
[time=1476] Vespian was the emperor of Rome.
[time=1478] And he sent his son Titus.
[time=1481] They had taken care of some uprising.
[time=1483] He said, "You know what?
[time=1484] I want you to go to Jerusalem and I want you to take it." And so off Titus goes, not the Titus in the Bible.
[time=1490] Titus another name, okay?
[time=1492] Off he goes to siege Rome or to siege Jerusalem.
[time=1496] And that's what they did.
[time=1497] They seized it.
[time=1498] And then Titus, he went to the temple and he built big scaffoldings.
[time=1501] He put a bunch of wood in there and a bunch of other things that would burn.
[time=1504] And then he lit it on fire.
[time=1505] And the fire was so intense that the brick and the rock was just disintegrate.
[time=1510] And then what they would do is they would take and they would sift through all of that rubble to try to find all the gold.
[time=1515] Because the temple was not only large bricks, but it was just covered in gold.
[time=1520] And different things that are of wealth and Rome wanted those.
[time=1523] And so they would sift through it and they'd take that gold back with them.
[time=1526] And then he took the rest of that rubble and they threw it down in the Kidron Valley.
[time=1530] Temple was completely wiped out.
[time=1532] Jesus saw that.
[time=1533] The disciples didn't understand that.
[time=1535] They didn't know that that was going to happen.
[time=1537] I've always found it intriguing as we go through this passage.
[time=1540] Jesus never told them, and by the way, in the year 70 AD, Vespian emperor of Rome, Titus is going to go destroy temple, gather up the guys, get a game plan, stop that.
[time=1550] Jesus never did that.
[time=1552] Because that wasn't the point of the passage.
[time=1555] That's not the point of what he's talking about.
[time=1558] Notice that in verse 3 that Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives.
[time=1567] And the Mount of Olives is a strategic place.
[time=1569] If you've never been to Jerusalem, I've never been there, but I've read about it.
[time=1573] Jesus is sitting on the Mount of Olives and right across from the Mount of Olives is the city of Jerusalem.
[time=1577] Very good panoramic view of the temple in the whole city.
[time=1580] And in between that is the Kidron Valley.
[time=1583] So I'm imagining in my mind that Jesus is sitting there and he's talking about the destruction of the temple.
[time=1589] And he's actually visualizing that because he sees the temple, Kidron Valley.
[time=1593] It's going to be destroyed.
[time=1594] This is how it's going to happen.
[time=1595] And he could envision that.
[time=1597] Very interesting place.
[time=1598] Notice that he's sitting.
[time=1599] He's not standing.
[time=1601] A very big difference in posture here.
[time=1605] I used to coach a baseball years and years ago.
[time=1608] And there are two of my baseball players that attend our church, so don't move.
[time=1612] Don't get up.
[time=1613] I would tell the guys, I'd say, I'd say bring it in.
[time=1617] On hop.
[time=1618] That means fast.
[time=1619] Hit a knee.
[time=1620] And that's what they would do.
[time=1622] They would come in.
[time=1623] They would kneel right in front of me.
[time=1624] And that would give me a position of authority immediately over them.
[time=1628] Because I'm standing there kneeling.
[time=1630] I have a higher position of authority.
[time=1632] Okay?
[time=1633] Jesus could have had that position of authority, but he didn't.
[time=1636] He chose a set.
[time=1637] And as soon as he sat, now that relationship becomes more intimate.
[time=1641] More conversational.
[time=1643] Because Jesus is human.
[time=1645] And these are his buds.
[time=1646] There is his gang.
[time=1647] And they're going to have a chat.
[time=1648] They're going to have a conversation.
[time=1649] He's going to teach them.
[time=1650] He wants to make sure that they're communicating eye-to-eye.
[time=1654] So Jesus is sitting on the mountain.
[time=1657] And here's what the disciples say.
[time=1658] Tell us, when's this all going to happen?
[time=1660] This destruction of the temple thing.
[time=1662] When's that going to happen?
[time=1664] Because if you go through the history of Israel, Israel wanted the Messiah to come.
[time=1670] They were longing for that Messiah to come.
[time=1672] What were they longing for though?
[time=1674] They were longing for that Messiah to come and deliver them from the oppression of the government.
[time=1679] That's what they thought.
[time=1681] That's what they wanted.
[time=1683] Jesus came with a different deliverance.
[time=1685] That's not what they were kind of hoping for.
[time=1687] They were hoping for some of that.
[time=1689] Come in and take care of these guys.
[time=1691] Get them off our back.
[time=1693] And so I'm imagining in the theater of my mind.
[time=1695] Does anybody have a theater in your mind?
[time=1697] I have a theater of my mind.
[time=1699] I'm imagining that these disciples are sitting there like, Jesus, when is this going to happen?
[time=1703] And their eyes kind of brighten up a little bit.
[time=1706] A little twinkle in their eye.
[time=1708] They're like, wow, this is it.
[time=1711] This is going to happen.
[time=1713] We're going to destroy it.
[time=1714] We're going to have this big battle.
[time=1716] And I can imagine that the disciples were ready for that.
[time=1719] I mean, four of the disciples were fishermen.
[time=1721] And if you don't know anything about fishermen back then, they were rough and tough and hard to bluff.
[time=1726] They were tough, tough guys.
[time=1728] As a matter of fact, the book of Mark refers to James and John as sons of thunder.
[time=1733] Isn't that a great description?
[time=1734] Sons of thunder.
[time=1736] Is there anybody in your life that you would refer to as a son of thunder or a daughter of thunder?
[time=1742] Yeah, it's very easy for us to draw that visual image.
[time=1745] This person is tough.
[time=1747] They're aggressive.
[time=1748] They're verbal.
[time=1749] They're boisterous.
[time=1750] Those are the kind of guys that were on the disciple team.
[time=1752] They were ready.
[time=1754] Can you imagine?
[time=1755] Can you pick your Peter sitting there and he's hearing this and he kind of reaches down and taps his fish boning knife.
[time=1760] Yeah, let's do this.
[time=1763] Maybe that's what they were thinking.
[time=1765] But then they continue on.
[time=1766] And when are you going to come back?
[time=1768] Wouldn't we love to know when Jesus is going to come back?
[time=1770] Will we love to know the date and time?
[time=1772] Well, Jesus didn't date and time stamp that.
[time=1774] He didn't tell him.
[time=1776] Here's how Jesus responds in verse four.
[time=1780] He says, "Take heed that no one deceives you." Take heed that no one deceives you.
[time=1787] Many will come and they will profess to be prophets.
[time=1790] They will profess to be the Messiah.
[time=1792] And please, don't be deceived.
[time=1796] Jesus knew that was going to happen.
[time=1798] And if you look at the history of Israel, even before the year 70, when the temple was destroyed, there were so many false prophets.
[time=1806] As a matter of fact, it tells us when Felix was invited, you can read about Felix in Acts 23 to 25.
[time=1814] The country of the Jews was filled with imposters so much.
[time=1818] Felix had to put them to death day by day.
[time=1821] A lot of them.
[time=1822] A lot of false messiahs would come forth and say, "I am the Messiah." There was a group that went down.
[time=1828] A guy got a bunch of people to go with him.
[time=1830] They went to the Jordan and say, "I'm going to part the Jordan.
[time=1832] Watch me." Well, I'm sure that, you know, when he didn't do that, the reality set in, right?
[time=1837] Another guy grabbed a bunch of people, got about 30,000 and said, "Come on.
[time=1840] We're going to go to Jerusalem and watch me.
[time=1842] I'm going to say something and the walls are going to fall down." Once again, didn't happen, false messiah.
[time=1849] And Jesus said, "Be careful.
[time=1851] Do not be deceived.
[time=1853] This is going to happen." We have false prophets in our lifetimes, don't we?
[time=1859] James Jones?
[time=1860] Jim Jones?
[time=1861] David Koresh?
[time=1863] There are people that are teaching in areas of the world today who are proclaiming something
[time=1869] other than the gospel.
[time=1870] They're proclaiming that they are the Messiah.
[time=1872] They got the thing figured out.
[time=1875] Jesus says, "Don't be deceived."
[time=1881] He continues on in verse 6.
[time=1882] You know what?
[time=1883] Wars, rumors of wars.
[time=1885] See that you're not troubled, for they seem must come, for the end is not near.
[time=1889] Wars is a sign of the end, not the end.
[time=1892] Nation will rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places.
[time=1898] If you just take a casual view through the history of Israel and even the history of our lives those things happened.
[time=1906] Those things happened.
[time=1907] We could point to them in our world today, couldn't we?
[time=1910] We could point to earthquakes and famines and pestilences, I mean disease.
[time=1914] That's what pestilences is.
[time=1916] Earthquakes, we can do that, wars, rumors of wars, false messiahs.
[time=1921] That still continues on today.
[time=1924] And Jesus says in verse 8, "All these things will be the beginning of sorrows.
[time=1929] Other translations say of birth pangs." And I think that's a really interesting concept.
[time=1936] I've never had birth pangs.
[time=1939] I never have them, guys.
[time=1941] I'm going to choose right now.
[time=1942] Praise the Lord.
[time=1943] We got out of that one.
[time=1945] Amen, we did.
[time=1946] All right?
[time=1947] That's a tough gig right there, birth pangs.
[time=1949] But here's what I've learned.
[time=1950] I don't know this because I've never had it, but here's what I've learned.
[time=1953] We have three children, so we've gone through this as a school principal for many, many years.
[time=1958] I had many young teachers who came to our school and would find themselves having a family and life was good and they were pregnant, and that was awesome.
[time=1966] Okay?
[time=1967] But here's what I've learned.
[time=1969] Right before, and maybe ladies, you can maybe back me up on this, right before those birth pangs begin, they're in a position where they're like, "I have had enough of this.
[time=1978] I'm done.
[time=1980] Get it over with.
[time=1983] I'm ready." And you'd say, "Well, you know, labor's good.
[time=1986] I don't care.
[time=1987] I've got to be done with this.
[time=1989] I have had enough." And then the birth pangs start.
[time=1994] And then what happens with birth pangs is that they continue in intensity and frequency, right?
[time=2000] And that first birth pang happen, it's like, "Whoo!" Like that.
[time=2006] And by the end, it's like, "Oh, knocking you down.
[time=2010] I don't care.
[time=2011] Get this kid out.
[time=2012] I'm done." You know?
[time=2014] And typically, generally speaking, when birth pangs are over, are we not excited about the result?
[time=2021] We are, right?
[time=2022] We're excited.
[time=2023] We have a baby.
[time=2024] And my wife went through this the first time.
[time=2025] She has no idea.
[time=2026] I'm saying this to you.
[time=2027] She went through the first time and I'm like, "Oh, my, oh, I'm over here.
[time=2030] I'm so sorry.
[time=2032] We get all back and we get in the room.
[time=2033] You know what she says?
[time=2034] I'm ready to do it again.
[time=2036] I'm ready to have another child." And I said, "Yeah.
[time=2039] She's tough.
[time=2040] I love that." Generally speaking, when those birth pangs are over, we're happy with the results.
[time=2047] And we're sitting in a culture and in a world today where I'm kind of ready.
[time=2052] Are you?
[time=2053] I'm like, "Lord, I'm done with this.
[time=2056] This is just getting to be a mess.
[time=2057] I'm ready for this.
[time=2059] And I know that it's going to be difficult.
[time=2060] I'm okay with that.
[time=2062] I think today.
[time=2067] But I know when those birth pangs are over, what's on the other side of that?
[time=2073] Isn't it, Glory?
[time=2076] I'm ready for that, amen?
[time=2077] Oh, yeah.
[time=2079] Let's do that." So that's an interesting correlation to Jesus' straws for us.
[time=2085] Verse 9, I think there's a lot of heart in this verse because remember, Jesus was fully human and he's been with his buddies for three years.
[time=2095] And this is what he says in verse 9, he says, "Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake." Jesus loved these guys.
[time=2109] They weren't a committee.
[time=2111] They were disciples.
[time=2112] They were followers.
[time=2113] He loved them.
[time=2114] He hadn't chosen them.
[time=2115] He loved them.
[time=2116] They were his buddies.
[time=2117] And he had to sit on that mountain, look them in the eye and say, "They're going to
[time=2123] persecute you, they're going to kill you, they're going to hate you." And you know, it's because of me.
[time=2131] That's why it's going to happen.
[time=2133] I just don't think, I just can't envision Jesus delivering that message without choking
[time=2139] up a little bit, without the real passion coming out for his love for the guys.
[time=2146] But Jesus had to deliver that message to them.
[time=2149] And certainly that certainly occurred over the time.
[time=2153] You can go through, there's many, Peter and John were in prison.
[time=2155] You can read about that in Acts 4.
[time=2157] Paul and Silas were beaten and imprisoned.
[time=2161] The Jews grabbed Paul.
[time=2162] They wanted to kill him.
[time=2163] As soon as Paul began preaching, he began to experience persecution, Acts 9.
[time=2168] Paul was stoned in Acts 14, beaten and cast into the prison in Acts 16.
[time=2172] The scriptures tell us that Paul was beaten five times by the Jews.
[time=2177] Five times.
[time=2178] Even with stoned in Acts 7, James, the brother of John was killed by Herod, Peter was thrown in prison.
[time=2184] Jesus told him it's going to happen.
[time=2188] And it happened.
[time=2189] It happened just the exact way that Jesus told them was going to happen.
[time=2193] That had to be a hard message to deliver for Jesus.
[time=2196] They were experiencing difficult times.
[time=2200] They were on the cusp of experiencing even more difficult times.
[time=2211] Jesus could have told them.
[time=2213] Jesus could have said, "Peter, on such and such a day, such and such a time and such and such a circumstance, you're going to be crucified." He could have told John he was going to be exiled to the Isle of Patents.
[time=2225] He could have told them all those things.
[time=2226] But I always wonder why he didn't tell them.
[time=2229] Well, one of the reasons I think he didn't tell them because if he had told them, would they have not kicked into self-preservation mode?
[time=2235] I think I would have.
[time=2237] I think if Jesus told me, "You're going to die at this time, this is going to happen." I would have said, "Not me, I'm moving to Fort Wayne," right?
[time=2246] Jesus could have done that.
[time=2247] But Jesus didn't.
[time=2248] And the reason that I think he didn't was because he needed them to spread the gospel.
[time=2254] He didn't want them to kick into self-preservation mode.
[time=2257] He knew it was going to be tough, but he knew that was necessary for the gospel to advance in that community in that time.
[time=2264] And if he had told them, he knew the disciples had a propensity to be scared.
[time=2272] Peter was scared, wasn't he?
[time=2274] When Jesus was seized in the Garden of the Gethsemane, all the disciples got scared and off they ran, and they went this way and that way, and Jesus was, I think Jesus might have been like, "Yeah, I'm not going to tell you that because you're going to get scared, maybe?"
[time=2288] That's me just thinking.
[time=2291] Verse 11, "Many false prophets will rise up and deceive many." This is false teaching, and I can't tell you how much that's going on today.
[time=2302] My wife and I went to a church with a friend who was being, who was during membership of
[time=2308] the church.
[time=2309] It breaks my heart.
[time=2311] We sat there in for an entire service in a church.
[time=2314] There were probably four or five hundred people there.
[time=2317] Bible was not referenced once.
[time=2319] There was never a verse, read, a verse taught, never talked about Jesus, and that's a church.
[time=2329] We have a lot of churches that are teaching something other than that, but you know what?
[time=2333] This is Blackhawk.
[time=2334] And at Blackhawk, we never want to be false prophets.
[time=2339] At Blackhawk, we believe and teach the whole counsel of God.
[time=2344] That's why Jesse comes up and tells you what we're going to talk about next week, because that's in the Bible.
[time=2349] And we teach the entire counsel of God.
[time=2353] We are Blackhawk, and we believe that God is.
[time=2357] We believe that God is and has done everything that he tells us in his word.
[time=2362] We are Blackhawk, and we believe in Jesus Christ, and that he has done exactly what God's word tells us that he did.
[time=2369] At Blackhawk, we believe in the Holy Spirit, and we believe that he has done exactly what we see in God's word.
[time=2376] At Blackhawk, we believe this is the inspired word of God.
[time=2380] This does not contain the word of God.
[time=2382] It's not part of the word of God.
[time=2384] It's not a collection of stories.
[time=2385] This is the complete and inerrant word of God.
[time=2390] At Blackhawk, that's what we believe.
[time=2393] At Blackhawk, we believe there is only that sin out of the world through Adam in the garden.
[time=2399] And that that sin nature was passed down through the generations, and that this sin created a separation between God and man.
[time=2407] And that that sin has a penalty, and that penalty is death.
[time=2411] At Blackhawk, we believe that Jesus Christ was sent to this earth, born of a virgin, lived a perfect life, and gave of himself willingly to serve as a sacrificial lamb, whose death and shed blood was and is sufficient to cover the penalty for all of our sins
[time=2427] past, present, and future.
[time=2429] We are Blackhawk, and we believe there is only one way to eternal life in heaven, and that is through salvation through Jesus Christ.
[time=2438] But we also know that that free gift is available to anyone, to anyone who simply receives it
[time=2450] by proclaiming Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.
[time=2454] At Blackhawk, we believe that it is our responsibility and our privilege to share our Savior and Lord with those around us.
[time=2462] We are Blackhawk, and these are the things that we believe, and we will stand firm and
[time=2468] not be swayed to compromise by an increasingly aggressive but lost and dying world.
[time=2474] We are Blackhawk, and we will forever stand firm on the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2483] That's who we are.
[time=2491] That's where you attend church, and that's what we will stand for.
[time=2495] Now this is not an exhaustive list of what we believe and what we stand for.
[time=2498] If you want that list, you can find it in the DNA, the church doctrine, okay?
[time=2503] But this is the core of who we are and who we will always be at Blackhawk.
[time=2508] And it's very important periodically to regularly review and understand what we believe, because
[time=2514] for the first time in our lives, American Christians are facing some pushback from our culture.
[time=2521] Compared to human history and across the world today, the church in America has been living in a sort of Disneyland as it relates to persecution.
[time=2530] We've not had to deal with that.
[time=2533] But recent events in our nation have facilitated and espaled the end of cultural Christianity.
[time=2540] Maybe that's a good thing.
[time=2544] What is cultural Christianity?
[time=2545] We've been plagued by cultural Christianity for years.
[time=2549] It used to be a status symbol to attend church.
[time=2553] You went to church on Sundays, that's what you did in America, right?
[time=2558] And even in presidential elections, the church attendance by the candidate was a thing, wasn't
[time=2564] it?
[time=2565] We would watch for that in the news.
[time=2567] We'd watch for it on television.
[time=2569] I'm telling you, that one's probably going by the wayside soon.
[time=2577] It's different.
[time=2580] We're not the first ones to recognize it, Jesus recognized cultural Christianity.
[time=2585] That's why He was rebuking the Pharisees and the scribes.
[time=2591] Because they were cultural Christians.
[time=2593] They weren't living by the love of Christ.
[time=2595] They were living by the letter of the law.
[time=2599] Remember in Matthew 721, this will not be on the screen, but you're going to recognize it, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but He who does the will of my Father in heaven.' Many will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name?' Cast out demons in your name and done many wonders in your name.
[time=2620] I will declare to them, 'I never knew you, depart from me.' You who practice lawlessness, is that not cultural Christianity right there?
[time=2629] People who are putting up a front, who are putting up an act and saying, 'I'm a Christian, look at me.' Or they're doing the right things, they're going to the right places, but they've never committed their heart to Christ.
[time=2646] That's what a cultural Christian is.
[time=2648] I pray with every ounce of my being, that today there are no cultural Christians sitting in this room, that there are no cultural Christians sitting in this room, that you are dedicated
[time=2662] disciples of Christ, every one of us.
[time=2669] Verse 12 says, 'And because of that law this will abound, the love of many will grow cold.'
[time=2675] Some of your translations might say the love of most will grow cold.
[time=2680] Think of that, the love of most, the love of Christ, leading your first love as Jesus chided the church in Ephesus for in Revelation, you left your first love.
[time=2692] Have you left your first love?
[time=2695] Who did you serve this week?
[time=2700] Who did you pray for this week?
[time=2705] Because if your first love is Jesus Christ, then you're doing those things.
[time=2710] I'm not trying to guilt trip you, maybe I am, I don't know.
[time=2713] I'm not trying to guilt trip, but it's a reality.
[time=2715] If you are a disciple of Christ and you will do things of Christ, you will serve others,
[time=2721] you will love others, you will pray for others, because that's what Jesus Christ would do.
[time=2727] That's what we should do.
[time=2731] Verse 13, 'But he who endures to the end shall be saved.
[time=2735] Endures to the end means stand firm.' Now this is not Jesus saying that circumstances are going to come, and if you make it through
[time=2743] it, if you stand firm, then you will be saved.
[time=2745] That's not an if-then.
[time=2748] Jesus' point is here is the only people that could possibly make it through the end are true Christians.
[time=2755] That's who's going to be standing firm.
[time=2757] If you're a Christian, it's going to fall by the wayside.
[time=2760] Real, godly people, real disciples of Christ will be able to stand firm.
[time=2765] So I think Jesus would say to us today in 2015, 'Stand firm.'
[time=2771] Difficult things are going to come.
[time=2773] They were shared with us on the video screen today.
[time=2776] Difficult times will come in your life, 'Stand firm.' Stand firm when you experience trouble.
[time=2782] Stand firm when it seems like those around you are compromising, because they become because they will.
[time=2790] Stand firm when the world says there is no God and no Jesus Christ, as they are saying.
[time=2797] Loudly, there is a professor at the University of Sydney in Australia who teaches religious
[time=2804] studies, and he said there is no God and there is no Jesus Christ.
[time=2811] He's teaching religious studies and the fact that he is a professor at a college automatically
[time=2818] gives him amazing authority that I don't understand.
[time=2823] And he is teaching in his writing and in his classes that there is no God and there was no Jesus Christ.
[time=2828] Jesus Christ is merely a celestial idea.
[time=2834] Stand firm.
[time=2837] Stand firm when the world says there is no God, Jesus says, 'Stand firm.' Verse 14, 'The gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world.' There it is.
[time=2847] The gospel will be preached in all the world.
[time=2849] We will stand firm on the gospel.
[time=2851] Listen to Jesus' heart in this passage.
[time=2853] He starts it out by saying, 'Do not be deceived by false prophets, by false messiahs.
[time=2858] Don't be deceived.
[time=2859] Don't be deceived by false teaching.
[time=2862] Stand firm.
[time=2864] Stand firm.' Jesus is telling us in that chapter.
[time=2868] So how do I stand firm?
[time=2870] I get it rich.
[time=2872] I don't want to be a cultural Christian.
[time=2874] I don't want to be the type of person that when the end comes, Jesus says, 'Depart from
[time=2881] me, I never knew you.' I want to burn with passion for the Lord.
[time=2885] How do I do that?
[time=2886] Is that what we want as Christians?
[time=2889] How do we do that?
[time=2890] Well the answer is pretty simple.
[time=2893] I think that the church as a whole, we've made this seem so difficult, but it's pretty simple.
[time=2898] Number one, join the family.
[time=2901] Join the family.
[time=2902] If you have not committed your life to Jesus Christ, I beg of you to consider that today.
[time=2908] Join the family.
[time=2909] Be a member of the family of God.
[time=2914] Give your heart to Him.
[time=2917] John 3, 16, 'For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life.' All you have to do is believe in Jesus.
[time=2927] Commit your life to Him.
[time=2928] If you've not done that, please consider that today.
[time=2931] After the service, there will be elders down here.
[time=2933] If that's something you want to do, calm down.
[time=2936] Elders are all around the room and they would be so excited to be a part of that.
[time=2944] Secondly, participate in family events.
[time=2946] When you're a family member, participate in family activities, events.
[time=2950] Be a church.
[time=2952] Be here.
[time=2954] Make this a priority.
[time=2958] Statistics tell us that in a church, your regular attenders attend church three out of four Sundays in a month.
[time=2965] Everybody else, one to two.
[time=2969] Come together as a family.
[time=2971] Be here.
[time=2973] This should be a safe haven for us.
[time=2975] This should be a place where we can come and we can be together and we can be with people of like mind, of like faith that we can love on each other after we've gone through an entire week of facing the world and what the world has to offer to us and pull in at us and wearing us out.
[time=2990] We should come here to recharge our spiritual batteries.
[time=2994] Be here.
[time=2996] Get connected.
[time=2997] However, you get connected.
[time=2999] Maybe you're a small group person.
[time=3000] Maybe you're a Sunday school person.
[time=3002] Maybe you are a person who just likes to have Bible studies with groups at a restaurant on Thursday mornings or maybe you're the type of person that wants an accountability group.
[time=3011] It doesn't matter how you do it.
[time=3013] Get connected.
[time=3014] Jesus had a small group.
[time=3017] Get connected.
[time=3019] Join in family events.
[time=3024] Number three, read your Bible.
[time=3026] Oh, another speaker telling me I got to read my Bible.
[time=3031] This is the Word of God.
[time=3034] We need to be familiar with our sword of the Spirit.
[time=3038] Paul calls it in Ephesians 6 and the full armor of God.
[time=3041] If you read through the full armor of God, there is only one offensive weapon and that is the sword of the Spirit right here.
[time=3047] If you're going to take a weapon in the battle, you've got to know how that works.
[time=3052] Or maybe you have a tool of a trade that you've got to know how it works.
[time=3056] So I contacted a friend of mine who was a doctor and I said, "So, like you're going to go into surgery and let's say when you get a new tool or a new procedure, how does that go?" You know what?
[time=3066] He's not going to do.
[time=3067] The doctor is not going to open up the box with a new P.S.
[time=3069] "Oh, it's a new tool.
[time=3071] Surgery, let's go.
[time=3072] Let's do that." Does anybody want to go to that doctor?
[time=3075] No, because you want him to know that tool.
[time=3078] And so he's going to have workshops, he's going to have guided practice.
[time=3083] Somebody who knows how to use it is going to be there and somebody who's going to help train him, teach him he's going to go to workshops, look at webinars, all of that so he can learn that tool before he goes into surgery.
[time=3095] Learn your tool.
[time=3096] Right here.
[time=3097] Learn this.
[time=3099] Read it a little bit each day and somebody said, "Well, I have a hard time doing that.
[time=3102] I don't have enough time." Well, you know what?
[time=3107] Here's what you do.
[time=3108] The night before you go to work, take your Bible, walk out to some common place in your home that you have to pass.
[time=3113] At our house, it's the kitchen table.
[time=3115] We have three doors.
[time=3116] You can't get out of one of them walking past the kitchen table.
[time=3119] Open it up.
[time=3120] Open it up into a chapter that you want to read so that when you wake up in the morning and you're feeling harried and you're feeling fast and you're running, then you see you're about, "Oh, I'm going to go read this," and sit down and read a couple of verses.
[time=3133] Jesus was abused, beaten, lashed beyond recognition.
[time=3137] Luke tells us, "For you and me, I really think we can spend a few minutes reading his word in the morning." It doesn't have to be five chapters, a couple of verses.
[time=3148] Read your mind.
[time=3150] Read the word.
[time=3151] And if you get to the point where you can memorize Scripture, that's a great thing.
[time=3154] Psalms 1, 19, verse 11 says, "Your word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against." I've always focused on the, "Your word have I not hid in my heart, have I hid in my heart peace?" And so, I would memorize verses.
[time=3165] I would memorize passage.
[time=3167] I would memorize entire chapters because I'm not going to sin against the Lord.
[time=3171] And as I've gotten older, I realize, "There's a correlation here.
[time=3174] For word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin, so there's a correlation between the word and the sin." And then I realized, "Maybe I should memorize verses relative to my weaknesses." Amen?
[time=3185] "May I have a weakness?" And maybe I should memorize a verse there, right?
[time=3192] I mean, it really doesn't do me, I'm not bragging, I'm just telling you.
[time=3196] It doesn't do me any good to memorize a verse on drunkenness, I've never tasted alcohol.
[time=3201] So, I mean, it doesn't really do me a good to memorize a verse on that.
[time=3204] But you know what I struggle with?
[time=3206] Materialism.
[time=3207] I'm a proctor of the foster care system.
[time=3210] And when I was little, I had nothing, literally nothing, zero nothing.
[time=3213] And so, when I would get things, I would grab them and I would like, "Oh, I can have stuff," right?
[time=3218] And so, I do struggle with that.
[time=3220] And then I learned, 1st, 2nd Chronicles 29, 11, and 12.
[time=3223] Everything in the heavens and earth is yours, O Lord.
[time=3226] My family will quote that, we'll quote it together.
[time=3229] And they don't know this is kind of a subversive thing, but they're helping me with my weakness.
[time=3234] So maybe you have a weakness.
[time=3236] Maybe you have material possessions.
[time=3237] How about 2nd Chronicles 29, 11, and 12?
[time=3240] Maybe you have an inappropriate thought life.
[time=3242] How about Philippians 4, 8?
[time=3244] Whatever things are pure, lovely.
[time=3246] Maybe you have a problem with gossip or talking a lot.
[time=3249] How about Ephesians 4, 29?
[time=3252] Proverbs 10, 19.
[time=3253] Maybe you have problems with conflict, Romans 12, 18.
[time=3258] Maybe you struggle with money.
[time=3259] How about Hebrews 13, 5?
[time=3261] Maybe you have your covetous person.
[time=3264] How about Luke 12, 15?
[time=3265] Whatever your weakness is.
[time=3266] Find a verse.
[time=3267] And here's how I found verses.
[time=3269] I went to the internet and I went to the search bar and the search engine and this is what I typed in.
[time=3273] Bible verses on, pick your weakness.
[time=3278] Hit enter, boom, listen, listen, listen to them.
[time=3283] Find one, check in the Bible to make sure it's accurate, memorize that verse.
[time=3286] Write it to yourself as you go about your day.
[time=3289] I am so far over time, there never will not be come back.
[time=3296] Join the family, participate in family activities, know your sword and pray.
[time=3301] Pray.
[time=3302] Martin Luther says to be a Christian without prayer is no more possible than to be alive without breathing.
[time=3307] Wow.
[time=3308] And I'm talking about authentic prayer here.
[time=3311] I'm not talking about the prayer that you're going to say when you go to dinner today thanking God for his provision.
[time=3315] That's important.
[time=3316] I'm talking about your intimate time and prayer.
[time=3318] I'm going to ask you a question.
[time=3319] I want you to be honest.
[time=3321] We were taught a song was saying to be honest, right?
[time=3324] Beginning of prayer, amen.
[time=3327] There's a line.
[time=3328] What percentage of that time in your prayer life is you talking?
[time=3334] Be honest with yourself.
[time=3336] What percentage is that you talking?
[time=3341] Because prayer can't be all about that.
[time=3344] Jesus was in the garden of Gethsemi the night before he was crucified.
[time=3347] He prayed all night long.
[time=3349] You can't talk all night long.
[time=3352] Some people say, oh, yeah, you can't.
[time=3353] I said, no, you can't.
[time=3355] I know this because I had a girl in my class one time, sweetheart of a girl, she wouldn't stop talking.
[time=3360] I might talk to her all the time, stop talking or pain.
[time=3364] We're doing this, but she has so much to share.
[time=3366] So you know what I did?
[time=3367] I told her you're coming to class after school today, she's going to have the detention.
[time=3371] She never had the detention in her life.
[time=3372] She came to my classroom.
[time=3374] And I sat a chair in the middle of the room, and I had her sit in it.
[time=3377] She had a sit in perfect posture, and I said, no, talk for 30 minutes, nonstop.
[time=3382] She had to talk for 30 minutes, nonstop.
[time=3384] She lasted three minutes.
[time=3386] I don't know what to talk about.
[time=3387] I said, I don't care.
[time=3388] You just got to keep talking for 30 minutes.
[time=3390] You can't talk all night long, so clearly Jesus, when he was praying, was listening.
[time=3396] There's a little challenge for you.
[time=3399] And you can use a stopwatch.
[time=3400] I'm good with that.
[time=3401] Okay?
[time=3402] And then when you're done praying, look at your stopwatch and think, I prayed for five
[time=3408] minutes, and then sit quietly before the Lord for five minutes.
[time=3412] That's authentic prayer.
[time=3413] It might be hard to start with, but go after it, pray.
[time=3422] When Jeffrey joined the family of God, his new life was no longer consistent with the popular viewpoint of the world.
[time=3428] He could've easily succumbed to the tidal wave of humanism, secularism, evolution, science.
[time=3432] He could've altered his beliefs to eliminate conflicts and justify the positions of those around him.
[time=3437] The choice was his, but he knew that the change within him was real.
[time=3441] He knew that God is real.
[time=3443] Jesus was a savior, and the Holy Spirit was within him and guiding him.
[time=3447] He would not let his love grow cold.
[time=3449] False messiahs?
[time=3451] No.
[time=3452] False teachers?
[time=3453] Not interested.
[time=3455] Jesus changed, redeemed, cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ, persecution, ridicule, non-acceptance
[time=3461] may all come his way, but he is committed to stand firm on the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=3468] Heavenly Father, I thank you for this day.
[time=3472] I thank you for the opportunity for us to open your word and take a look at what your son did on this earth for us.
[time=3480] Lord, we want to stand firm.
[time=3482] Our world is tough, but it's not new to us.
[time=3486] Other societies have been difficult and maybe even more difficult than ours, but for us this is the first time, as my friend Steve would say, we're soft as Christians.
[time=3497] We're soft, but we want to stand firm.
[time=3501] We want to stand firm on the gospel, and the way that we can do that, Lord, is to be here, to be a part of a family, to read our Bible, study our Bible, memorize Scripture, and to pray, and to lay our lives before you.
[time=3514] So as we go today, Lord, I pray for each member of this church today that they would live
[time=3520] a life that would please you, that they would spend time serving others, they would spend time praying for salvation of others, because we are Christians, we are Christ-like, we are disciples of Christ, and we want to live that way.
[time=3534] Jesus' name, amen.
